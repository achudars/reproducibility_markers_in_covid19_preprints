Abstract
Background: Like many other countries around the world, Bangladesh adopts Universal
Health Coverage (UHC) as a national aspiration. The central theme of its providing quality
and affordable health services which is a significant element of social protection. This paper
was aimed to provide a narrative understanding of the perspectives of UHC in Bangladesh
towards COVID-19 based on the existing literature.
Methods: We conducted a review combining articles and abstracts with full HTML and PDF
format. We searched Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and Google using multiple terms related
to UHC, COVID-19 and Bangladesh without any date boundary and without any basis of
types of studies, that is, all types of studies were scrutinized.
Results: This short description highlights that the current pandemic COVID-19 holds lessons
that health systems and economies in several countries like Bangladesh are not in enough
preparation to tackle a massive public health crisis. It reports the shortage of health workers,
scarcity of personal protective equipment, limited and ineffective diagnostic facilities,
inadequate infrastructure of health care facilities, scarcity of drugs, and underfunded health
services. Further, COVID-19 pandemic highlights the country’s health system needs an
ongoing rehab post-COVID-19 with strong coordination in governance, in health economics,
in health systems, in information systems, as well as in community participation in health to
achieve UHC.
Conclusions: Addressing the needs for UHC achievement, it is important to break down the
access barriers and keeping up to date all the activities addressing public health crisis like
COVID-19.
Perspectives
World Health Organization (WHO) defines Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as- ensuring
access to needed health care services including health promotion, prevention, treatment, and

rehabilitation when and where appropriate without financial hardship among the user (WHO,
2020a).Approximately half of the people across the globe are deprived from health services
they need including 100 million are pushed below poverty line every year because of out of
pocket payment on their health[1]. In 2015, the nations of the world set UHC as one of the
target under goal 3 when adopting Sustainable Development Goals. By achieving UHC
countries can achieve progress towards other health-related targets including other goals
since sound health allows children to learn, adults to earn, helps to reduce poverty, and
strengthen economic development[2].Therefore, all countries has given their consent towards
achieving UHC as part of the 2030 Agenda except Bangladesh. According to the commitment
of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh in the 64th World Health Assembly held in May 2011,
the country committed to gain UHC by 2032[3]. Less than 1% of the total population has a
health coverage scheme against health expenditure including 3.8% is pushed into poverty line
for paying health services each year. Though Bangladesh has achieved significant progress
over the last 2 decades, 64% health expenditure is still come from out of pocket. As a result it
is experiencing the highest expenditure (15%) compared to neighboring country India (10%
to 12%) and Thailand (2%)[4].
The recent COVID-19 is an ongoing global public health crisis according to WHO
declaration on 30 th January, 2020 which was first emerged at Wuhan city of China[5], [6]. In
Bangladesh, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) declared the
first confirmed cases on 8th March, 2020 [7]. After that country has taken numerous control
measures fighting against COVID-19 though these available control measures are
significantly influenced by the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID19[8]. However, adoption of control measures, the country is facing frequent problem like
economic and social standstill and among them health sector is the most affected sector by
the pandemic[9]. As of 9th November, 2020 Bangladesh confirmed 42,238 cases with 6067

deaths and 338,145 recovery [10]. This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 in
Bangladesh and lesson learned towards achieving UHC by 2032.
Literature search strategies
We reviewed the literature (PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Google and online
newspapers in Bangladesh) to get recent information on UHC, UHC and COVID-19 in
Bangladesh.

Lessons towards COVID-19 and Bangladesh
Public health emergency leads any country in a danger if it beyond under control. Likewise,
recently declared public health emergency COVID-19 affected more than 216 countries and
territories with 50,782,732 confirmed cases and 1,262,751 deaths as of 9 th November, 2020
around the world. It has shown the critical need for the preparedness during a disaster to the
world. Preparation is the fundamental tool for mitigating the impact of any catastrophe and
COVID-19 taught the world a great lesson by showing its severity. When many countries are
struggling to provide UHC to its community, a new emerging public health problem such as
COVID-19 pose a global threat and continue to rise and spread its impact on people in many
ways like physically, mentally, economically, and so on. Extended health emergencies due to
the pandemic of COVID-19 the supply sides (like health systems) went under an enormous
pressure. The aftermath has a significant impact on the vulnerable population by lacking
social protection and access to health care services in their normal life [11]. The Lancet
Global Health Commission addressed poor quality care is now a bigger barrier to reducing
mortality than insufficient access. It estimates approximately 60% of deaths from conditions
amenable to health care are due to poor quality care, whereas the remaining deaths result
from non-utilization of the health system[12]. This situation more is dreadful for vulnerable
groups including the poor, the less educated, adolescents, those with stigmatized conditions,
and those at the edges of health systems, such as people in prison [13]. Compared to other
South Asian countries, Bangladesh has one of the best government health infrastructure
including 500 upazila health complex, 5000 union sub centers, 13000 satellite clinics,
secondary, and tertiary care hospitals. Yet the country is facing lack of skilled health care
professionals particularly in rural areas, scarcity of health care resources, financial
constraints. Most of the time patients have to pay all cost related to health service from their
pocket which leads to poor people become poorer and even rich are also facing hardship with

the costly treatment procedure[4]. During COVID-19 pandemic the country has a severe
scarcity of testing kits in stocks and only some 20,000 have been distributed to other parts
testing laboratories around the country[14], [15]. However, China provide some testing kits,
masks, infrared thermometers, and PPE to deal with the crisis but this amount only covers a
small proportion needs[16].
Approximately, 1.1 million slum dwellers living in extremely close quarters are hardly
conscious about the threat of COVID-19 and most of them passed their life with great
difficulty by losing jobs due to pandemic crisis. These families have less facilities of
bathroom, toilet with scarcity of water. Therefore, maintaining hygiene is a challenge to
them. The same situation goes for Rohingya refugees, who fled in Bangladesh from
neighboring country Myanmar in 2017, leading to vulnerable health condition among these
population and increase more chance to illness[17-19]. Since there is scarcity of PPE
(personal protective equipment), testing facilities most of the health workers which is not
sufficient compared to large population refused to provide service with this crisis due to fear
of infection[20]. According to a study conducted in Gazipur Upazila, e-health care have
dropped 80% due to absence of doctors, 58% being deprived of basic human needs, 71%
pregnant women missed their regular ANC check-ups, 70% female faced familial
complications, and Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has also dropped during
pandemic [21]. As a result, shortage of health workers, scarcity of personal protective
equipment, inadequate infrastructure of health care facilities, scarcity of drugs, and
underfunded health services has revealed more clearly during this pandemic that shows a
consistent impediment to achieve UHC in Bangladesh. In addition relocating medical staff to
emergency site from previous department increase scarcity of service delivery in those site
like non-communicable diseases, HIV, Tuberculosis, mental health, maternal and child
health, increased unwanted pregnancy, malaria, and diphtheria[9]. Furthermore, in this

critical time, smart planning with sufficient preparation for mitigating the incidence and
prevalence of disease including designing the future prospect is very important to achieve
UHC[22]. Because evidence on the management approaches of current COVID-19 pandemic
is still limited though the numbers of affected countries are increasing as the days go by[23].
However, to achieve UHC in Bangladesh should include development of a long term national
human resources policy and action plan considering the emerging and re-emerging health
risks, establishment of a national insurance system, building of an interoperable electronic
health information system and investment to strengthen the capacity of the ministry of health.
Conclusion
Health is a fundamental human right, and UHC is a key to achieve health for all. Addressing
the needs for UHC achievement, it is important to break down the access barriers by
removing financial, geographical and cultural barriers in a sustained way that reduce the out
of pocket expenditure among Bangladeshi people. Additionally, COVID-19 pandemic
focused the necessity of healthy economy by controlling the pandemic effectively with
sustainable solution measures. As a lower middle income country, Bangladesh has limited
resources in health sectors which needed rapid reforms of resources for achieving UHC by
2032. Hence, by developing the need basis stronger and resilient health infrastructure the
country will be able to provide timely response during any health crisis including better
protection against future outbreak control with access to needed health care excluding
financial burden.
