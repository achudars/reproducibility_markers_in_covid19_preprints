ABSTRACT

Pneumonia patients of 2019-ncov in latent period are not easy to be effectively quarantined, but there is
evidence that they have strong infectious ability. Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period
is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation
dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the
incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively.
Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters
of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the
effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was
analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.
The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a major epidemic
that humans are experiencing. As a kind of coronavirus, it
poses a continuing threat to human health because of its high
transmission efficiency and serious infection consequences
[1]
. Since the first case of novel coronavirus pneumonia was
discovered in early Dec 2019, it has spread widely over the
past two months. By the end of 10:00, Feb 10th, 2020, there
were 42708 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection and
21675 suspected cases in China. At present, 2019-nCoV
pneumonia cases have been confirmed in dozens of
countries and regions including the United States, Germany,
France, Canada, Australia, and Japan.
The rapid spread of 2019-noV pneumonia around the
world poses a major threat to the closely connected and
interdependent world today. The reproductive number R
refers to the average number of secondary cases generated
from primary cases, and has become a key quantity to
determine the intensity of interventions needed to control
epidemics[2]. On January 29, 2020, Li et al conducted a study
of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan, showing that the
R of 2019-nCoV was 2.2, and revealed that person-to-person
transmission occurred between close contacts [3]. On January
26, 2020, new research shows that the reproductive ratio of
2019-nCoV is 2.90, which is higher than the 1.77 SARS
epidemic[4]。In the absence of comprehensive treatments or
vaccines, China has adopted the most effective isolation
prevention and control measures to isolate patients
diagnosed with 2019-nCoV to control the spread of infection,
but the number of 2019-nCoV infections has far exceeded
that of SARS epidemics. Existing basic research results and
actual situation of epidemic spread have shown that 2019nCoV has a higher pandemic risk than the outbreak of SARS

in 2003[4]。
This paper discusses the feasibility of using the
deterministic model of the transmission dynamics model of
infectious diseases to assess the development of the 2019nCoV epidemic in China. Some researchers have tried to
study and evaluate the development trend of the 2019-nCoV
pneumonia epidemic through the transmission dynamics.
On Jan 24, 2020, British scholars Read et al[5] estimated that
the number of 2019-nCoV infection cases in Wuhan would
reach 190000 on Feb 4, which obviously overestimated the
development trend of the epidemic. On Jan 31, 2020, Wu et
al[6], scholars from Hong Kong, China, predicted that the
number of infections in Wuhan on Jan 25 exceeded 75815,
which also obviously overestimated the spread of the
epidemic. Chinese scholars Shen et al. [7] used dynamics
models to predict the peak time and scale of the epidemic,
and estimated that the peak number of infections was less
than 20,000, which was lower than the raw data released on
Feb 10. Chinese scholars Xiao et al. [8] established a
transmission dynamic model with considering intervention
strategies such as close tracking and quarantine. Based on
their model, scholars predicted that the epidemic would
reach its peak around Feb 5[8], which made an early
estimation of the peak time of the epidemic. In summary,
although some researchers have carried out research on the
transmission dynamics of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia
epidemic, the real epidemic development has far deviated
from the prediction results of previous studies.
In previous studies on the transmission dynamics of
infectious diseases, the epidemic was in the early stages of
development and lacked sufficient raw data, so it was
difficult to accurately predict the development of the

epidemic. In addition, the shortcomings of the transmission
dynamic model itself have also become the direct cause of
limiting its prediction effect. Latent patients are not easy to
be effectively quarantined, and recent evidence shows that
latent patients have a strong infectious ability, but the
existing epidemic transmission dynamic models [5-8] often
ignore the transmission risks caused by patients in the latent
period. In addition, researchers have found that estimates of
the average latency of 2019-nCoV are also changing. The
incubation period was determined to be 7 days in January,
and it was recently estimated to be 3 days, which means that
2019-nCoV infected people become more likely to develop
symptoms.
Obviously, it is still necessary to make a new
assessment of the spread of the 2019-nCoV epidemic
situation, which has important practical significance for the
research, judgment and prevention of the epidemic situation.
In this paper, we established a new SEIR propagation
dynamics model, considering the weak transmission ability
of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation
period length, and the government intervention measures to
track and quarantine comprehensively. Based on this new
SEIR propagation dynamics model, the effect of infectious
ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of
the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence
time of peak number in China was predicted.
Considering that the Chinese Spring Festival began on
January 23 and the Chinese government initiated effective
prevention, control and quarantine measures for the whole
people, it can be considered that there are few new imported
cases in all provinces, and the impact of migrant population
flow can be basically ignored. Therefore, the premise of
carrying out dynamic model research on infectious disease
transmission is sufficient. The model in this paper is based
on the classical SEIR model. The classic SEIR model
divides the population into S (Susceptible), I (Infected), E
(Exposed), and R (Recovered). In this model, it is also
assumed that all individuals in the population are at risk of
infection. Antibodies will be produced when the infected
individual recovers, so the recovered population R will not
be infected again. In addition, quarantine measures to
prevent and treat infectious diseases are also taken into
account in the model. The population components in the
model also includes Sq (isolated susceptible), isolation
exposed Eq (isolated exposed) and Iq (isolated infected). In
view of the fact that isolated infected individuals will be
immediately sent to designated hospitals for quarantine and
treatment, this part of the population will be converted to
hospitalized H in this model. Therefore, the original
populations S, I, and E respectively refer to susceptible,
infected, and exposed individuals who have missed
quarantine measures. The isolated susceptible person is reconverted to the susceptible person after isolation. Both the
infected and the exposed have the ability to infect the

susceptible, turning them into the exposed. The
transformation relationship among different groups of
people is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure1. Modified SEIR propagation dynamics model
It is assumed that the quarantine ratio is q, the
probability of transmission is  , and the contact rate is c.
The transformation rates of S to Sq, Eq and E are cq (1 −  ) ,
c q and c  (1 − q ) , respectively. Therefore, the control
equation for the number of susceptible persons is
dS / dt = −[c + cq(1 −  )]S ( I +  E) +  Sq (1)
where  is the ratio of the transmission ability of the
exposed to the infected. When  =0 , it means that the
infection ability of the patients in the latent period is ignored.
When  =1, the infection ability of the patients in the latent
period is the same as that of the patients with symptoms.
And  is the rate of isolation release, hence  = 1/14 (the
quarantine duration is 14 days).
With the growth of statistical data, researchers'
estimation of the average latent period of 2019-nCoV is also
changing. The average incubation period has changed from
7 days determined in January to 3 days estimated recently,
which means 2019-ncov infected people are more likely to
show symptoms.  is the transformation rate from the
exposed to the infected. Considering the change of actual
latent period, a smooth transition curve from 1/7 to 1/3 is
used to represent the change law of transformation rate from
the exposed to infected under the change of the latent period.
The curve equation is
A− B
=
+B
(2)
1−t / t / k
1+e( 0 )
where A and B correspond to the values of the
transformation rate of the exposed to the infected in the early
and late stages of the epidemic period studied. The epidemic
data in this letter are from Jan. 23 to Feb. 10 in China, so A
and B correspond to the conversion rates of Jan. 23 to Feb.
10 respectively. In Eq. (2) , t 0 represents the time when the
conversion rate is the average of A and B, and k can be
directly determined by the rate of change and the derivative
value of the conversion rate at time.
The newly established 2019-nCoV modified SEIR
propagation dynamics system model is as follows

established in Ref.[8]. The results shown in Figure 2 show
that the peak estimate of the number of infected people using
the theory established in Ref.[8] is much higher than the
estimate made by the present theoretical model. This is due
to the neglect of the infectious ability of patient in latent
period in previous models[6-8]. Because only the infected are
transmissible, the actual probability of infection needs to be
overestimated to adequately fit the raw data, which
ultimately leads to overestimation of the number of infected
people.

where  I is the quarantine rate of the infected,  I is the
recovery rate of the infected,  q is the transformation rate
from the exposed to the isolated infected,  H is the

The epidemic data used in this paper comes from the
raw epidemic notification data published on the official
website of the National Health Commission of the people's
Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). In this paper,
the governing Eqs. 2 and 3 is solved using Euler's numerical
method, and the integration step is 0.01 (days). The initial
value of the dynamic system refers to the epidemic data
officially released by the Chinese government on January 23,
2020, and some parameters have been reasonably estimated.
The specific parameter values are shown in Table 1. The
other model parameters are the results of fitting optimization
based on the original data.

First of all, under different infectious ability of patients
with latent period (  =0,0.6,1 ), the corresponding model
parameters are obtained by fitting and optimization based on
the raw data, and predict the epidemic situation in future. As
can be seen from the Fig. 2, the corresponding optimal
model parameters are found with different infectious
abilities. Under the optimal parameters, the number of
infected persons predicted by the theoretical model is in
good agreement with the raw data from January 23, 2020 to
February 10, 2020. Next, we can analyze the effect of
different infectious ability of patients in latent period on
model estimation. Note that without considering the
infectious capacity of patients in the incubation period, that
is,  =0 , the present model can degenerate to obtain the
recent dynamic model of infectious disease transmission

Fig.3. Impact of variation of incubation period
length on the theoretical estimation.
Next, Figure 3 analyzes the effect of variation of
incubation period length on the theoretical estimation. It can
be seen from Fig. 3 that the peak number of infected persons
in the model considering the variation of the incubation
period is lower than that in the model with the constant
incubation period. This corresponds to an easily understood
fact. With the development of the epidemic, the length of the
incubation period has shortened, which directly leads to the
patients in the incubation period to show symptoms faster
and be taken to hospital and quarantined. Therefore, the

gradual shortening of the incubation period is obviously
conducive to suppressing the spread of the epidemic, and
eventually leading to a reduction in the peak number of
infections.

Fig. 4. Evaluation of the spread of China's 2019nCoV epidemic
Finally, the trend of China's 2019-nCoV epidemic was
evaluated by using the new present SEIR model. In order to
obtain an interval estimate of the peak number of infections
and its occurrence time, the contact rate was set to vary
within the interval of [2.8, 4.2]. The prediction of the current
theoretical model indicates that the number of 2019-nCoV
infections in China reaches its peak after February 19, and
the upper and lower limits of the estimated peak time of the
epidemic respectively correspond to the abscissa of the
peaks of the upper and lower envelopes of the theoretical
forecast data of the number of infected. The current
theoretical estimation of the number of infected people in
China is in good agreement with the raw number of infected
people in the period from January 23, 2020 to February 10,
2020. It is worth noting that the theoretical model and
parameters of this paper were initially established before
February 5. The prediction results of the number of infected
persons from February 6 to February 10 are mainly
consistent with the actual data of subsequent reports, which
initially proves the feasibility of the model in predicting the
short-term development situation of the epidemic.
This paper attempts to estimate the short-term
development of China's 2019-nCoV epidemic and predicts
that the number of people infected in China will peak after
February 19. It should be noted that because the infectious
ability of patient in latent period and variation of incubation
period length are considered, our present model in this paper
is closer to the real situation, so the estimates based on it
should also be more reliable. However, some necessary
assumptions are still made during the model establishment
in this paper. The mathematical descriptions made by the
model are different from the complex reality, which leads to
the inevitable deviation of the prediction results.
