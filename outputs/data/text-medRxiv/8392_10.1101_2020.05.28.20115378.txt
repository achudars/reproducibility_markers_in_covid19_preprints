Abstract
PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples is used for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) and for determining timing of discharge. The viral load usually declines at convalescent
phase, but sometimes remained positive for a long time even after relief of symptoms. In this study,
we identified older age is associated with sustained detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal
swab samples.

Introduction
Currently, the standard for diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection is a positive result on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test for
virus nucleic acids performed on nasopharyngeal swab samples. PCR test is also used as a guide for
patient discharge from designated hospitals and medical institutions. We report here the case of a
97-year-old female who developed mild symptoms and was diagnosed with coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Although her clinical symptoms and radiological findings resolved within a few
days, PCR results from nasopharyngeal swab samples remained positive for 40 days after the onset.
This case prompted us to conduct a retrospective study of the association of age the duration of
positive PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples in 66 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We

hypothesized that old age could be a risk for prolonged duration of positive PCR results from
nasopharyngeal swab samples.

Methods
This study was approved by the ethics committees of National Hospital Organization Hokkaido
Medical Center.
Sample collection
Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from all patients; additionally, oral mucosal swab
samples were collected from one patient (the case presentation). Samples were obtained by using
FLOQSwabs (COPAN, Murrieta, California, United States [US]). To perform sampling, the swab
was passed through the nostril until reaching to the posterior nasopharynx; the swab was removed
slowly while rotating. The swabs were placed in saline solution prior to evaluation.
PCR
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted as instructed in the
manual for the Detection of Pathogen 2019-nCoV Ver.2.9.1, March 19, 2020, by the National
Institute

specimen. One-step RT-qPCR was performed using One-Step Real-Time RT-PCR Master Mixes
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, US) and the extracted RNA. The instrument
used was the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A forward primer
(5-AAATTTTGGGGACCAGGAAC-3), reverse primer (5-TGGCAGCTGTGTAGGTCAAC-3)
and TaqMan probe (5’-FAM-ATGTCGCGCATTGGCATGGA-BHQ-3’) were used for detection of
viral RNA. In a real-time PCR assay, cycle threshold (Ct) value is defined as the number of cycles
required for the fluorescent signal to cross a baseline threshold. The test results of SARS-CoV-2

were reported as negative in tests in which Ct 45).
Patients
The patient in the case presentation has been followed in Hokkaido University Hospital. The
patients enrolled in the retrospective study, which explored the relationship between age and
duration of time until a positive PCR test reverted to negative, were followed in National Hospital
Organization Hokkaido Medical Center. In this hospital, when respiratory physicians (T.H. and
M.A.) recognized the peak-out of the COVID-19 infection, PCR tests were performed every day on
nasopharyngeal swab samples from each patient. This enabled us to determine the precise day that
each COVID-19 patient tested “negative” by PCR. We defined “negative PCR” as confirmed
negative results over two sequential days.
Statistical analysis

Continuous data were presented as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile
ranges (IQR), while categorical data were presented as frequencies and proportions. To compare
differences among the groups, Student’s t-tests or one-way analysis of variance were used for
parametric continuous variables, Mann–Whitney U tests were used for nonparametric continuous
variables, and chi-square tests were used for categorical variables. To evaluate the correlation
between age and the duration of positive PCR results, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used.
To adjust the effect of severity of the disease and the medication used, multivariate regression
analysis was applied Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software package JMP
version 13 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA). For
all statistical analyses, P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Case presentation
A 97-year-old woman with a high fever (38) and diminished appetite for one week was diagnosed
with COVID-19 by a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test and was referred to Hokkaido
University Hospital for ongoing evaluation and treatment. At the time of admission, she was under
treatment for hypertension and heart failure. She had no history of smoking. On admission, her blood
pressure was slightly high (157/75 mmHg) but she had no cough or dyspnea, and her oxygenation
was within normal limits. Laboratory data showed slight elevation of serum C-reactive protein (0.49

mg/dL). Her chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed slight ground glass
opacity (GGO) in the lower left lobe of the lung. In our hospital, we confirmed the positive PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 in samples taken from nasopharyngeal swab. Treatment with favipiravir and
ciclesonide was initiated; fever resolved within a few days after admission. On hospital day 5, serum
CRP decreased to within normal range and the GGOs on chest radiograph disappeared. Her appetite
also recovered and here general condition was good. However, at 40 days after the onset of disease,
results of PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab samples remain positive. We also confirmed that, results
of PCR on the oral swab sample was negative at 35 days. Table 1 documents the change in Ct value
over time for PCR tests performed on both oral mucosa and nasopharyngeal swab samples.

Retrospective evaluation of the association between age and the duration of
positive PCR tests of samples from nasopharyngeal swabs
The aforementioned case prompted us to conduct a retrospective study to determine the association
of patient age with prolonged duration of positive PCR results among patients diagnosed with
COVID-19. We analyzed the records of 66 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between
March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020 at National Hospital Organization, Hokkaido Medical Center.

The median age of COVID-19 patients was 61 years old (range, 22 to 99 years old). All patients

were admitted to our hospital after having been diagnosed by positive PCR results from
nasopharyngeal samples. 42 subjects were mild cases, who did not require supplemental oxygen
treatment. 18 subjects were moderate cases who needed oxygen treatment. 6 subjects were severe
cases who needed ventilator or/and ECMO. Characteristics of the 66 patients diagnosed with mild
COVID-19 are presented in Table 2. Twenty-three subjects had received drug treatment for
COVID-19, including favipiravir, litoravir/rapoinavir, ciclesonide, and camostat mesylate.

We found that older age was significantly associated with prolonged positive PCR tests among those
diagnosed with COVID-19 (P=0.0053; Figure 1A). This relationship remained unchanged when the
findings were adjusted for the potential impact of severity of the disease (mild, moderate, severe) and
the used of medication (P=0.026). When we analyzed only mild cases of COVID-19 in order to
exclude the influence of disease severity, the result remained significants (P=0.036; Figure 1B).

Discussion
At the time of this writing, Hokkaido, most northern island in Japan, has controlled the second wave
of COVID-19 and the rate of new cases continues to decrease. However, as per the statements of
and guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) (1), patients are discharged only upon

confirmed negative PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swabs taken on two sequential days. This results in
prolonged hospital stays as patients remain in beds in the designated infectious disease units
designed for acute and ongoing care. We have found that quite a few patients are in good general
condition, but remain hospitalized due to prolonged positive PCR tests. These patients who no
longer need acute care but cannot be discharged are currently a tremendous burden for our hospital.

In our analysis, older age is significantly associated with prolonged duration of positive PCR tests
from nasopharyngeal swab samples, irrespective of the disease severity and the medication used
(Figure 1). The reasons underlying these observations remain unclear. Of note, we recently
compared SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal vs. saliva samples from patients diagnosed
with COVID-19 (2); we found that quality of PCR from saliva as a diagnostic measure of
SARS-CoV-2 infection was equivalent to that of the samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. We also
found that findings from PCR tests reverted from positive to negative much more quickly when
using saliva than nasopharyngeal samples (2). We speculate that in older individuals, cell turnover
is less robust and as such, clearance of virus from the nasopharynx is prolonged; these factors may
lead to positive PCR tests that persist after acute disease has resolved. We note that the PCR test on
an oral mucosal swab sample was negative on hospital day 35. It is also possible that PCR detects
nonviable particles of viral components in less clean environment such as nasopharynx compared to

oral cavity.

One group from Taiwan has already discussed the possibility that COVID-19 may no longer be
contagious at two weeks after the onset of symptoms (3). As such, it is possible the positive PCR
tests reflect the presence of that inactive virions remaining within nose. Their findings suggest that
most transmission of COVID-19 occurred at the very early stages of the disease and perhaps even
before the onset of symptoms; of note, the secondary clinical attack rate among contacts decreased
over time as symptoms developed and progressed. In a linked study, Zheng and colleagues
evaluated viral loads in respiratory samples, stool, serum, and urine using PCR: they found that
more than half the respiratory samples remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 as did a full one third of
the stool samples at the end of the four week trial period (4). One important limitation of PCR
testing is the inability to differentiate between active infectious virus and their non-viable,
non-infectious viral counterparts. As such, we propose that there should be a change in the strategy
currently in use for determining time of discharge to one that relies on other clinical tests or/and
patients’ condition, which could be helpful to inhibit the development of patients’ flail and dementia
and to reduce the burden of ongoing and potentially unnecessary prolonged hospitalization.

In summary, it became evident that the results from nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests remained
positive for SARS-CoV-2 for prolonged periods of time despite resolution of the associated clinical
illness. Further, we demonstrated that old age is significantly associated with prolonged duration of
positive PCR results from nasopharyngeal swab samples; this is the case regardless of disease
severity. Further studies will be needed in order to clarify how long these patients are actually
contagious; this will be critical toward the effort to relieve the comparatively large burden placed on
hospitals and hospital staff at this time.
