Abstract
The SEIR model of COVID-19 is developed based on the system dynamics approach.
Compared with existing models, the model successfully reproduces similar multiple observed
outputs such as infected and recovered patients in Italy by July 2020. In doing so, the system
dynamics model captures the roles of undocumented cases on the Italian COVID-19 flow.
The model also considers two types of measures including behavioral measures and lockdown
measures as they are embedded in the model. It is hoped that the model can enhance our
understanding of the roles of undocumented cases, so-called asymptomatic cases, and the
efficacy of two different policies on the COVID-19 flow. This study concludes that the first
policy is important once the number of infected cases is relatively low. However, once the
number of infected cases is very high so the society cannot identify infected and disinfected
people, the second policy must be applied soon. It is thus this study suggests that relaxed
lockdowns lead the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world.

Introduction

Despite its high quality of the national healthcare program, Italy was the epicenter of the
corona virus disease (the COVID-19) during the European first wave. The Italy first closure
owing to COVID-19 was on February 22nd, 2020. As COVID-case spiked, the government
started the first measure on March 4th by closing public places such as stores, and schools as
well as enforcing physical distancing in severely affected areas close to Milan and Venice
(Sjödin et al., 2020). This lockdown was lengthened on March 9th, owing to a rise of
documented cases and confirmed deaths were about 7,000 people and 400 people
respectively.
Some existing studies discussed issues relate to Italian COVID-19 cases such as policy
measures (Flaxman et al., 2020; Lavezzo et al., 2020; Sjödin et al., 2020), the dynamics of

high COVID-19 cases (De Natale et al., 2020; Garazzino et al., 2020; Gatto et al., 2020;
Goumenou et al., 2020; Grasselli et al., 2020; Grossi et al., 2020), and comparisons of the
COVID-19 in Italy and China (Nesteruk, 2020). It appears that existing studies successfully
has modelled the COVID-19 cases in Italy and analyzed the main factors of Italian COVID19. However, at the best author knowledge, no available study have successfully modelled
two different notified policies in tackling the COVID-19: the behavior policy and the
lockdown policy. This is important as other studies (Carlucci et al., 2020; Graffigna et l.,
2020; Meier et al., 2020; Pagnini et al., 2020) highlighted the importance the first and the
second policies in minimizing the COVID-19 flow in Italy. Hence, this study compares the
efficacy two different measures in the Italian COVID-19 cases.
This study also investigate three important cases simultaneously including recovered,
infected, and dead patients, especially during the first wave in Italy. It this thus this study aims
to develop a SEIR model that explains dynamics of three important issues: infected,
recovered, and dead patients during the first wave of the COVID-19. As previous studies
mentioned ((De Natale et al., 2020; Raheem, 2020) possible roles of undocumented cases, this
study also investigates the important role of the undocumented cases in Italy. With keep these
points in mind, the author believes that modeling the COVID-19 in Italy can give us
understanding the dynamics flow of the COVID-19 in terms of behavior, lockdown policies,
and undocumented cases. This means this study provides more insights for policymakers in
the flow of the COVID-19 in other areas.
In the first section, this study explains existing studies of COVID-19 in Italy. Furthermore,
this study explains the system dynamics approach to understand dynamic of susceptible,
exposed, infectious and recovered patients in Italy. Thus, this study offers a holistically
comprehensive SEIR model than existing studies (e.g. Dehning et al., 2020; Raheem, 2020;
Sjödin et al., 2020). This study also offers analysis that is more comprehensive as this study
analyses the impacts of undocumented cases than an existing study (De Natale et al., 2020;
Flaxman et al., 2020; Gatto et al., 2020; Lavezzo et al., 2020). The latter is important as
undocumented cases have an important role in the COVID-19 flow in Italy (De Natale et al.,
2020; Raheem, 2020) and in China (Li et al., 2020).
The system dynamics approach has a long tradition to model health issues such as
epidemiology, healthcare facilities, and non-communicable diseases (Darabi, N. &
Hosseinichimeh, 2020; Homer, & Hirsch, 2006). Because of this, this study develops a SEIR
model based on the system dynamics approach to simulate observed deaths, observed
recoveries, and observed incidences in Italy.

Data and methods

Required data were collected from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, www.rki.de
(Robert Koch Institute) and https://coronavirus.jhu.edu (John Hopkins University). Three data
types including active cases (infected people), deaths and recovered people were extracted
from aforementioned sources.
This study develops a mechanistic model as (Holmdahl & Buckee, 2020) explained the
mechanistic model such as the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered (SEIR) can
capture the impacts of uncertain parameters, capture non-linear feedback, and the efficacy of
policies.
Previous studies have successfully simulated infectious, non-infectious diseases, and other
healthcare issues (Donsimoni et al., 2020; Darabi & Hosseinichimeh, 2020; Davahli et al.,
2020; Homer & Hirsch, 2006). Owing to this, the SEIR model used in this study is developed
based on the system dynamics approach. Despite usefulness of the SEIR model, some
uncertain parameters have not been defined or unknown. The SEIR model also investigate the
efficacy of policies in minimizing the COVID-19 flow and the role of undocumented cases.
To obtain the best parameter values, this study applies the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) calibration process owing to unknown parameters using Vensim©. To obtain the
best parameter values, the system dynamics model compares three outputs including infected
cases, death cases, and cumulative death cases. The three respective observed variables are
compared with simulated variables to get the best parameter values in which means that the
best parameter values lead to the smallest variances.
The model starts the simulation from January 1st, 2020 and runs in daily terms until by July
2020. Simulated parameters such as an incubation time, Ro, and an infection duration are
based on existing studies. It is important to note that the SEIR model will be set in two
different first confirmed cases. Previous studies (e.g. Usuelli, 2020) noted that COVID-19
models of Italy should assume that the first confirmed case is infected Chinese tourists who
was acknowledged as an imported COVID-19 case on January 31st, 2020. While other studies
(De Natale et al., 2020; Gatto et al., 2020; 2020; Sjödin et al., 2020) assumed that the first
Italian confirmed case should be the first infected male on February 21st, 2020.
III. Discussion and results
To obtain the best value for each parameter, at the first step, the SDM is embedded by range
values stated in table 1 and at second step, we run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
calibration available in Vensim©. To accommodate uncertain parameter values, this study set

The SIER model
The system dynamics model (SDM), so called stock-flow model, for Italian cases can be seen
in figure 1. The SDM consists of five stocks such as the susceptible, infected, and recovered
cases. The SDM also accommodates the impacts of behavioral measures such as physical
distancing, hand washing, and mask covers. For these measures, the SDM applies two
variables namely, “behavioral risk reduction” and “behavioral reaction time”. These two
variables respectively explain efficacy of and starting time of aforementioned measures in
minimizing the flow of COVID-19. The more striking COVID-19 cases, the more critical or

In considering

striking cases, the SDM also captures the impacts of such isolation related measures through
two variables: “lockdown risk reduction” and “lockdown reduction time”. Similarly, the two
variables respectively explain efficacy and starting time of lockdown policies in minimizing
the flow of COVID-19. The SEIR model is sketched as seen in figure 1.
Other studies (Grosi et al., 2020; Goumenou et al., 2020) stated that undocumented cases may
be responsible of rising cases in Italy and other cities in China (Li et al., 2020). The SDM
reveals the roles of undocumented cases through two variables: “undocumented infected
cases” and “fraction of undocumented cases”. A fraction of undocumented cases is a portion
of undocumented cases compared with documented cases. In this model, documented cases is
represented as “infected rates”.

recovered, and undocumented cases. In the model, undocumented cases is represented as a
multiplication between a fraction of undocumented cases and infected cases. Time variables
such as recovery time is defined the average time between the symptom onset and recovery
while infected duration is defined as the average time between the symptom onset and deaths.

The SEIR model calculates the number of infected cases, deaths, and recoveries are based on
equations 1-3 as follows:

infected rates = "cumulative-exposed"/incubation time………………………………… .… (1)
dying rates = "cumulative-infected1"/infection duration ..……………………………….…
(2)
recovery rates = "cumulative-infected1"/recovery time ….……………………………….…
(3)

Transmission rate measures the number of exposed people after contacting or stand closes
with infected people. Following Fiddaman (2020), transmission rate is calculated based on
equation 3. For the first policy, its impact is calculated based on equation 4. Equation 4 means
that the first policy of behavioral reduction risk decreases transmission rate based on two
factors: “behavioral reduction risk” and “behavioral reduction time”.

Transmission rate = (Ro/recovery time2)*fraction of susceptible*(1-the impacts of behavioral
risk reduction) …………………………………………………………………………….… (4)

The second policy i.e. lockdowns is calculated similar to equation 4. Equations 5a and 5b
show the number of exposed cases decreases after the second policy starts at “lockdown
reduction time”.

the expected impacts of lockdown risk reduction = IF THEN ELSE(Time>=import

After running the calibration policy as stated in section Data and Methods, optimized values
for each parameter are shown in table 2. The second and third columns represent optimized
values if the first case is around January and around February 2020 respectively. As seen in
table 2, there no much value differences between the two columns. This implies that the first
policy i.e. voluntary acts such as social distancing and handwashing hindered the COVID-19
in early January 2020. In other words, the first policy is helpful once the number of infected
cases are relatively low (Piguillem & Shi, 2020). However, that study (Piguillem & Shi,
2020) also claimed that once the COVID-19 cases rise significantly so separating infected and
disinfected people owing to is relatively difficult, policymakers must apply the second policy.

Looking back at table 2, it appears that voluntary acts such as handwashing and social
distancing, despite their importance in hindering the COVID-19 flow, have the relatively
lower effect than the lockdown policy (31%-37% vs 65%). However, this does not mean that
voluntary acts are not needed. The first policy such as handwashing and social distancing
could hinder the flow of COVID-19 in the first wave despite its relatively low effects.
This study also highlights that the important roles of undocumented cases, so-called
asymptomatic cases, during the first wave of COVID-19 in Italy. This study finds that
undocumented case was about 70% of the confirmed cases in Italy. A possible reason of this
is a fraction of symptomatic patients is not treated in hospitals as usual but at home (Long et
al., 2020).

Concluding remarks

Using the system dynamics approach, Italian COVID-19 is successfully modelled. . Differing
from other studies, this study aims to model dynamics of infected, recovered, and dead cases
incorporating undocumented cases. Moreover, the SDM captures the positive effects of policy
measures including behavioral policies (masks, handwashing, and social distancing) and
lockdowns or isolations
Once optimized values for each parameters are obtained through the MCMC calibration
process, the SEIR successfully reproduces similar outputs as observed outputs. The SEIR
model provides evidence that the first policy has relative lower impacts than the second
policy. Nevertheless, the first policy is important once the number of infected cases are
relatively low. Once the number of infected cases are high, the second policy shows relatively
higher impacts in minimizing the flow of COVID-19. The higher impacts of the second policy
than the first policy may be a clue to the second wave of the COVID-19 around the world.
