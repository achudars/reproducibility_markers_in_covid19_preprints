ABSTRACT
Importance: Identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via antibody assays is important for
monitoring natural infection rates. Most antibody assays cannot distinguish natural infection
from vaccination.
Objective: To assess the accuracy of a nucleocapsid-containing assay in identifying natural
infection among vaccinated individuals.
Design: A longitudinal cohort comprised of healthcare workers (HCW) in the Minneapolis/St.
Paul metropolitan area was enrolled. Two rounds of seroprevalence studies separated by one
month were conducted from 11/2020–1/2021. Capillary blood from round 1 and 2 was tested for
IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with a qualitative chemiluminescent ELISA
(spike-only assay). In a subsample of participants (n=82) at round 2, a second assay was
performed that measured IgGs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (nucleocapsidcontaining assay). Round 1 biospecimen collections occurred prior to vaccination in all
participants. Vaccination status at round 2 was determined via self-report.
Setting: The Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area.
Participants: HCW age 18-80 years.
Exposures: Round 1 recent SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via a spike-only assay and
participant self-report.
Outcomes: Round 2 SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed via the nucleocapsid-containing assay.
Area under the curve (AUC) was computed to determine the discriminatory ability of round 2
IgG reactivity to nucleocapsid for identification of recent infection determined during round 1.
Results: Participants had a mean age of 40 (range=23-66) years, 83% were female, 46%
reported vaccination prior to the round 2 testing. Round 1 seroprevalence was 9.5%. Among
those not recently infected, when comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals, elevated
levels of spike 1 (p<0.001) and spike 2 (p=0.01) were observed while nucleocapsid levels were
not statistically significantly different (p=0.90). Among all participants, nucleocapsid response

predicted recent infection with an AUC(95%CI) of 0.93(0.88,0.99). Among individuals
vaccinated >10 days prior to antibody testing, the specificity of the nucleocapsid-containing
assay was 92% and while the specificity of the spike-only assay was 0%.
Conclusions and Relevance: An IgG assay identifying reactivity to nucleocapsid protein is an
accurate predictor of natural infection among vaccinated individuals while a spike-only assay
performed poorly. In the era of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, seroprevalence studies monitoring
natural infection will require assays that do not rely on spike-protein response alone.

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via antibody assays is important for monitoring natural
infection rates. Currently authorized antibody tests measure antibody reactivity to spike proteins,
yet these develop in response to both infection and vaccination1,2. Consequently, ongoing
antibody studies will be unable to accurately differentiate prior SARS-CoV-2 infection from
vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in populations with high vaccination coverage.

Current vaccines are not expected to illicit a nucleocapsid response. Consequently, antibody
tests that target both spike and nucleocapsid proteins can potentially identify prior infection
among vaccinated individuals. The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of a
nucleocapsid-containing assay vs. a spike protein-only assay in the identification of prior SARSCoV-2 infection among a sample of healthcare workers (HCW) in the United States.

METHODS
A sample of healthcare workers located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, USA, metropolitan
area was enrolled3 and two rounds of seroprevalence studies were conducted from November
2020–January 2021. A subsample of participants (n=82) for whom excess blood was available
for testing with both a spike-only assay and a nucleocapsid-containing assay are presently
included. The study was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. All
participants provided informed consent.

Biospecimen Collection and Antibody Assay
Seroprevalence studies occurred in two rounds (Figure 1). Participants collected their first
capillary blood specimens between 11/22/2020–12/18/2020 and a second specimen from
12/26/2020–1/08/2021; median time between round 1 and round 2 specimen collections was
28.5 days (range 12–44 days). All round 1 specimens were collected from participants before

vaccination. Samples were home-collected using Neoteryx Mitra® 10 µl samplers by volumetric
absorption of capillary blood from a finger-stick.

Two separate assays were used in this analysis: the Quansys Q-Plex™ SARS-CoV-2 Human
IgG (4-Plex), an EUA authorized qualitative chemiluminescent ELISA that concurrently
measures Human IgGs reactive to SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit S1 (S1) and spike subunit S2
(S2) (hereafter, ‘spike-only’ assay), and an assay that adds measurement of human IgGs
reactive to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid to the spike-only assay (hereafter, ‘nucleocapsidcontaining’ assay)

Round 1 samples were tested using the spike-only assay and round 2 samples were tested
using both the spike-only assay and the nucleocapsid-containing assay.

Assay details are presented in the supplemental materials.

Statistical Analysis
‘Recent infection’ with SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result from the round 1 (all round
1 assays were performed prior to vaccination) spike-only assay, or a self-report of recent
infection; we consider this to be the definition of ‘true-infection’ (hereafter referred to as
‘infected’ or ‘infection’). Self-reported vaccinations status (yes/no, dose and date) was assessed
from questionnaires. Participants were further classified as having been vaccinated 0-7, 7-10, or
>10 days prior to collecting capillary blood during round 2.

Kruskal-Wallis tests compared median IgG response to nucleocapsid protein from the
nucleocapsid-containing assay at round 2, by vaccination and infection status. Receiver
operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and area under the curve (AUC) was

computed to determine the discriminatory ability of round 2 IgG reactivity to nucleocapsid for
identification of infection. The optimal nucleocapsid cut-point was defined using Youden’s
value.4 The accuracy of identifying infection from Youden’s optimal nucleocapsid level was then
compared to the accuracy of the spike-only assay using round 2 samples.

The accuracy was also estimated for the nucleocapsid-containing assay using the cut-point
defined by Youden’s value (described above) in comparison to concurrent round 2 results from
the spike-only assay among unvaccinated individuals. In this analysis, infection was defined by
results from the concurrent round 2 spike-only assay. These results were then compared
against results from the round 2 nucleocapsid-containing assay.

RESULTS
The mean age of participants was 40 (range=23-66) years and 83% were female. No
participants were vaccinated prior to round 1 testing, while 46% of participants reported
vaccination prior to the round 2 testing. Among those vaccinated prior to round 2, the mean time
between vaccination and antibody testing was 9 days (range=1 to 34). Round one
seroprevalence (via the spike-only assay) was 9.5%.

Median values of S1, S2, and nucleocapsid were all statistically significantly elevated among
infected vs. uninfected participants (all p-values <0.0001, Figure 2). Among individuals who
were not infected, elevated levels of S1 (p=0.0005) and S2 (p=0.01) were observed among
vaccinated compared to unvaccinated participants (Figure 2a, 2b) while nucleocapsid levels
were not statistically significantly different by vaccination status (p=0.90, Figure 2c).

Among round 2 samples, nucleocapsid response predicted infection with an AUC(95%CI) of
0.93(0.88,0.99), Figure 2d. Respective AUC(95%CI) values for S1 and S2 were 0.81(0.72,0.90)
and 0.89(0.81,0.96). The optimal nucleocapsid cut-point based on Youden’s value was 0.42 and
yielded an AUC(95%CI) of 0.89(0.82,0.96) with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 88%.
Among the n=37 with vaccination prior to round 2 biospecimen collection, the optimal
nucleocapsid cutoff remained at 0.42 with an AUC(95%CI) of 0.95(0.88,1.0), a sensitivity of
90% and specificity of 100%.

Among unvaccinated individuals, sensitivities for the spike-only and nucleocapsid-containing
assays were 95% and 85% respectively (Table 1). Among vaccinated individuals both assays
had 100% sensitivity. Among unvaccinated individuals the specificity of the spike-only assay
was 86% while among individuals vaccinated >10 days before round 2 testing specificity
decreased to 0%. In contrast, the specificity of the nucleocapsid assay increases from 86% to

90% among unvaccinated vs. vaccinated individuals. Participants with apparent false positive
findings for the nucleocapsid-containing assay (i.e., positive result for the nucleocapsidcontaining assay during round 2 and a negative result from the spike-only assay at round 1), the
median time between rounds 1 and 2 testing was 33.5 days raising the potential that these
individuals were truly infected in the interim.

Supplemental Table 1 presents test diagnostics results among unvaccinated individuals for the
nucleocapsid-containing assay compared to the gold standard spike-only assay test results from
the same blood collection time at round 2; this minimizes the potential for false positive findings.
Sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 100%, respectively. As expected, when comparing
Supplemental Table 1 results to results for the nucleocapsid-containing assay among only the
unvaccinated in Table 1, the specificity improves from 86% to 100%, due to fewer false positive
findings.

DISCUSSION
We evaluated the ability of an IgG antibody assay that assesses reactivity to the nucleocapsid
protein to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection among a population of HCW, with and without
infection, and before and after vaccination. This is the first investigation of this nature to our
knowledge. We found that in the context of vaccination, nucleocapsid response is highly
predictive of infection. Among vaccinated individuals, the nucleocapsid assay had a
substantially higher specificity, and positive predictive value, compared to the spike-only assay.

Results in table 1 are limited because infection was determined using an antibody test
conducted approximately one month before round two testing, and it is possible that participants
appearing as a false-positive in Table 1, were truly infected between round one and round two
and developed an antibody response. Therefore, our findings underestimate specificity for the
nucleocapsid-containing assay.

An IgG assay identifying reactivity to nucleocapsid protein was an accurate predictor of recent
infection among a population of vaccinated HCW. These findings suggest that in the era of
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, seroprevalence studies monitoring natural infection will require
assays that capture reactivity to the nucleocapsid protein.

ON-LINE ONLY SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS
Samples were eluted at room temperature (RT, 18-22°C) for 30 minutes on a shaker (500rpm)
in 120 µl of a buffer and diluted to the equivalent of 1:100 of venous plasma. The assays are
performed at RT with no shaking according to the following steps: (1) 60 minutes incubation of
sample/calibrator/control (2) Tris Buffered Saline with Tween (0.05%) (TBST) Wash (3) 30
minutes incubation of biotinylated anti-IgG (4) TBST Wash (5) 20 minute incubation with
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (6) Wash (7) chemiluminescent substrate (8) Image and
analysis using the Q-View™ Imager LS and Q-View™ software. In round 1, a microplate was
arrayed with 4 spots in each well: 1) Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein (S1),
comprising amino acids 1-674 of subunit 1, fused with a Sheep Fc-Tag and expressed in
HEK293 cells; 2) Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein (S2), comprising amino acids
685-1211 of subunit 2, fused with a Sheep Fc-Tag and expressed in HEK293 cells; 3) Sheep
Fc, a negative control to ensure no cross-reactivity occurs between human IgGs in the sample
and the Fc-Tag on the SARS-Cov-2 Spike proteins; 4) Anti-Human IgG is a positive control to
ensure that sample was added to the plate and that the procedure was properly followed.
Round 2 added a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid spot, comprising amino acids 1-419,
expressed in HEK293 cells.

The spike-only assay used qualitative positive cutoffs for S1 and S2 generated by multiplying a
specific correction factor to the ratio of low to high calibrator signal. To determine the semiquantitative S1, S2 and nucleocapsid ratios for the nucleocapsid-containing assay, the signal
(pixel intensity) value for each analyte is divided by the signal of the calibrator high point.
