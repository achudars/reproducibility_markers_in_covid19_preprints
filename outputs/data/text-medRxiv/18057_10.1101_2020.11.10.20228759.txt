Abstract
Background
Vaccination against COVID-19 will likely involve children in order to mitigate transmission risks in
community settings. Successful implementation of COVID-19 immunization in the United States may
hinge on factors associated with parents' likelihood of immunizing their children and themselves.
Methods
We fielded a national household survey in English and Spanish from June 5-10, 2020 (n=1,008).
Parents were asked about their likelihood of immunizing their children and themselves against
COVID-19. We fit separate regression models of parents’ likelihood to vaccinate themselves and
their children against COVID-19, using bivariate and multivariable approaches in analyses weighted
to be nationally representative.
Results
Overall, 63% of parents (95% CI: 59%, 66%) were likely to vaccinate their children against COVID19, and 60% (57%, 64%) were likely to get a vaccine themselves. These responses were highly
correlated (Pearson’s r=0.89). Parent age, sex, marital status, education level, and income were all
associated with parents’ likelihood to vaccinate their children and themselves in bivariate analyses;
race/ethnicity was significantly associated with parents’ likelihood to vaccinate their children. In
multivariable analyses, younger parents were significantly less likely than older parents to vaccinate
their children and themselves against COVID-19, as were parents with high school or less education
compared with parents with bachelor’s degrees and non-Hispanic White parents compared with
Hispanic parents (all p<.05).
Conclusion
In this national survey, only approximately 60% of U.S. parents stated that they are likely to vaccinate
their children or themselves against COVID-19. Addressing parents’ hesitancy to vaccinate
themselves and their children against COVID-19 will be instrumental to achieving herd immunity in
the US.

Introduction
Vaccination against COVID-19 will likely involve children in order to mitigate transmission risks in
school and daycare settings.1 Successful implementation of a COVID-19 immunization program in the
United States will depend on factors commonly associated with vaccination patterns, such as
sociodemographic characteristics,2 and may also relate to environmental exposures such as COVID19 case incidence and mortality rates. No peer-reviewed studies have examined parents’ likelihood to
vaccinate their children and themselves against COVID-19.

Methods
To assess factors associated with parents’ likelihood to vaccinate themselves and their children
against COVID-19, we fielded a national household survey in English and Spanish from June 5-10,
2020.3 The survey had a 50% completion rate (n=1,008);4 survey weights were assigned to permit
national estimates of the attitudes of parents with at least 1 child younger than age 18 while
accounting for differential non-response. This study was considered exempt from human subjects
review by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.

Parents were asked two vaccination-specific questions (“If a vaccine against COVID-19 becomes
available in the next 12 months, how likely are you to get it for [yourself/your child(ren)]?”). Four
original response options were dichotomized into “Likely” (“Very likely” and “Somewhat likely”) and
“Unlikely” (“Not too likely” and “Not at all likely”) for purposes of analysis. We abstracted state-level
COVID-19 cumulative case counts and case fatality rates (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/statetimeline) in the middle of our survey field period (June 8) as well as changes from 1 month prior (May
8). We fit separate models of parents’ likelihood to vaccinate themselves and their children against
COVID-19, using bivariate and multivariable approaches in R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team, Vienna,
Austria).

Results
Overall, 63% of parents (95% CI: 59%, 66%) were likely to vaccinate their children against COVID19, and 60% (57%, 64%) were likely to get a vaccine themselves. These responses were highly
correlated (Pearson’s r=0.89). Parent age, sex, marital status, education level, and income were all
associated with parents’ likelihood to vaccinate their children and themselves in bivariate analyses;
race/ethnicity was significantly associated with parents’ likelihood to vaccinate their children (Table
1). Parent employment status, child age, and state-level population-adjusted COVID-19 case
incidence and mortality rates were not associated with likelihood to vaccinate (data not shown).

In multivariable analyses, older parents were significantly more likely than younger parents to
vaccinate their children and themselves against COVID-19, as were parents with bachelor’s degrees
versus parents with high school or less education and Hispanic parents compared with non-Hispanic
White peers (Figure 1).

Discussion
In this national survey, only approximately 60% of U.S. parents stated that they are likely to vaccinate
their children or themselves against COVID-19. This level of hesitancy among US adults about
vaccination against COVID-19 is similar to a separate study among adults (not limited to parents with
minor children) fielded about 6 weeks earlier, which also found associations of hesitancy with younger
adult age and lower educational attainment.2

Greater hesitancy regarding childhood vaccines is also commonly associated with less education
among parents, often related to strong belief systems regarding risks of disease versus risks of
inoculation.5,6 Our study may be limited by a sample that included a disproportionately high number of
high-income respondents, although this is similar to other recent national surveys of this topic.5 We
attempted to mitigate this sampling bias through population-based survey weighting in our analyses.

Addressing parents’ hesitancy to vaccinate themselves and their children against COVID-19 will likely
be essential to achieve herd immunity. Working with parents to understand personal reasons for
hesitancy will help facilitate uptake when safe and effective vaccines to prevent COVID-19 become
available.

Based on parents’ response to the questions: “If a vaccine against COVID-19 becomes available in the next 12 months, how likely are you to get it for
[yourself/your child(ren)]?”. Response options were: Very likely / Somewhat likely / Not too likely / Not at all likely. For analysis, we collapsed “Very likely” and
“Somewhat likely” as “Likely” and “Not too likely” and “Not at all likely” as “Unlikely”.
