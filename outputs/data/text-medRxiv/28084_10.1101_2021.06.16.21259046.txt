Abstract (195 words)

26

Objective: To quantify the delay in SARS-CoV-2 real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

27

testing and test result reporting in Mexico and Colombia, and to assess the relation between

28

margination status and these delays.

29

Methods: We quantified time in days from symptom onset until testing (latency one) and delay

30

in test results report (latency two) using freely available country-wide open data from Mexico

31

and Colombia. Directed acyclic graphs were built to determine which associations were

32

appropriate to assess. Stratification by margination status, state and hospitalization status was

33

used to determine corresponding associations.

34

Results: In almost all the study period latency two was longer than latency one. Median latency

35

one was 3 (IQR 0-6) days and latency two 7 (IQR 4-11) days in Colombia, while in Mexico they

36

were 3 (IQR 1-5) days and 4 (IQR 3-6) days. In Colombia, worse margination status prolonged

37

latency two. In Mexico, a lower number and percentage of point-of-care (POC) tests in areas with

38

worse margination.

39

Conclusion: POC tests must be used as a widespread means to reduce latency two, and until then

40

should be prioritized in areas with longer latency two. An unequal distribution of this resource

41

should be avoided.

Introduction

49

Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, massive testing has been a staple of epidemic control

50

worldwide to detect cases, initiate contact tracing and quarantine individuals who were exposed

51

(1). Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was the first available

52

test and remains widely utilized (2, 3). Being the only test available at the beginning of the

53

pandemic, it was used both for epidemiologic surveillance and individual diagnosis (4). It has an

54

almost perfect specificity but suboptimal sensitivity, making false negative results a relevant

55

problem in high prevalence areas, as it becomes easy to undercount cases and misinterpret a

56

negative result (5).

57

An important issue is the timing of the tests, and there are two main reasons for this. If an RT-

58

PCR test is performed late during the natural history of the infection, it could be futile for means

59

of epidemiologic surveillance (6, 7). A person that is tested in their 5th day of symptoms but

60

obtained their result 5 days later has remained without a diagnosis for 10 symptomatic days,

61

which could impact their ability (if their job required a positive test to justify absence) or

62

willingness to isolate (7). If they tested positive in their 20th day from symptom onset they have

63

ceased to be contagious, and the test would only help to determine if they were infected (and

64

even then, the sensitivity would be suboptimal for that purpose and an antibody assay could be

65

more useful) (8). Conversely, a positive test in a person who is on their 5th day of symptoms

66

would allow for relatively early isolation and contact tracing. Thus, delay in test results report has

67

a negative impact both in epidemiological surveillance and individual diagnosis. Using open data,

68

we describe the frequency and length of delays in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests after symptom

69

initiation and in laboratory tests results report and determine its association with margination

70

status.

Methods

73

We searched in the Our World in Data COVID-19 pandemic coverage, an initiative by the

74

University of Oxford, for COVID-19 open access data that met eligibility criteria for our study

75

(3). We selected open access country datasets, available in a machine-readable format (e.g. csv,

76

xsl, json, etc) that were regularly updated (at least weekly), and containing at least the following

77

variables at the individual level: date of symptoms onset, date of COVID-19 testing, date of tests

78

result report, and type of test used for diagnosis (RT-PCR, antigen, clinical diagnosis, other). If

79

information on the type of test used for diagnosis was not available (either included as a variable

80

or in the dataset description), we included the country if we found a description in which test use

81

was described (for example, if a statement of the country’s health authority said that antigen tests

82

were introduced at a given date). We excluded datasets of countries with no available information

83

on type of test used for diagnosis and date. For date of testing and date of diagnosis, countries

84

were also eligible if these variables could be calculated with information provided in the dataset.

85

No language restriction was used, and Google translate was used when no English or Spanish

86

version of a given website was available. As RT-PCR is considered the gold standard, we

87

excluded countries that did not use this type of tests or had no information on the kind of test

88

used. Study period could differ between databases. We considered the date in which an individual

89

was first included to be the beginning of the study period. Individual patients were included until

90

January 31st 2021, and final follow up was February 10th 2021 to allow for delayed reporting.

91
92

Definitions

93

We were interested in exploring delays at two steps of the diagnostic process: delays in seeking

94

care by individuals and delays in the health system in reporting diagnostic test reports. Thus, we

95

generated variables to analyze these as outcomes. Diagnosis date was established searching daily

96

databases using a loop for the date in which a result was first reported for any given individual.

97

We defined latency one as the time in days between date of symptom onset and the date of

98

testing. We assume this period is mainly determined by an individual’s characteristics. Latency

99

two was defined as the period of time in days between the date of sample collection and the date

100

of test results reporting and we assume this period was determined by factors related to the health

101

systems. We considered the total time between date of symptom onset and date of test result,

102

defined as total latency, as the sum of both latencies for each individual.

103

We classified individuals as early testers if they were tested for COVID-19 within the first 3 days

104

of symptom onset, late testers if tested between the fourth and eighth day of symptom onset, and

105

very late testers if tested after the eighth day of symptom onset. We also classified the second

106

latency period as efficient if the RT-PCR result was available within two days of sampling, and

107

inefficient if it took longer. Finally, total latency was classified as optimal if it was shorter than 5

108

days, regular if it was between 6 and 10 days long, or inadequate if it was more than 10 days.

109

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reports that virus transmissibility begins two days

110

before symptoms onset up to 9 days after tit (11). Thus, we used this interval of time (extending

111

until 10 days after symptom started for practicality) to define patients as “infectious”.

112
113

Statistical analysis

114

We used rolling means to describe the length of latencies one, two, and total latency during the

115

study period, and proportions to describe the frequency of early, late and very late testers (latency

116

one); efficient and inefficient test results reporting (latency two), and optimal, regular, inadequate

117

total latency. We calculated the amount of time that would be saved with point-of-care tests,

118

which would eliminate latency two, dividing the total amount of latency two and the number of

tested patients. We stratified the analysis by margination status, which was calculated differently

120

for Colombia and Mexico. For Colombia we included the “multidimensional poverty index”

121

(MPI), which is calculated yearly using a national representative household census (12, 13). It

122

evaluates five key aspects: education, childhood and youth, health, work, and living place (13). A

123

score of zero (no deprivation) and one (deprivation) is then calculated for each household and the

124

proportion of deprived households sampled by country and state (the smallest specified

125

geographical area) is then reported. The most recent version corresponds to the 2019 census (14).

126

For Mexico, we calculated the “margination index” (MI), a metric developed by the Mexican

127

Consejo Nacional de Población (National Population Council, CONAPO) also calculated for

128

each household sampled in a national census. The smallest specified geographic area for which

129

this index is calculated is a “locality”. It is constructed by the percentage of people that have each

130

of nine socio-economic characteristics for that geographical area: older than 15 years and

131

illiterate, older than 15 years and incomplete elementary school, no sewer system, no electricity,

132

no tubing water, household overcrowding, dirt floor, less than 5,000 habitants in the locality, and

133

population with an income of maximum the equivalent to two minimum wages. This last variable

134

is not available in the most recent census, so we will substitute it for “percentage of people above

135

age 12 that are not economically active or currently attending school”. Each variable weights 1/9,

136

and with a score that ranges from 0 to 100 (higher score indicating higher margination). The 2020

137

census did not include the MI, so it was manually calculated using the information on individual

138

variables with the open database created by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography

139

(INEGI, due to its initials in Spanish). In the COVID-19 open database each individual is

140

identified up to municipality (multiple localities join to form a municipality), so a mean score

141

was calculated for each municipality using the score of the localities that conform each

142

municipality, using the total population of each locality as a weight. We stratified patients by

143

MPI or MI quintiles.

144

To determine whether confounding could impair the validity of stratification by multidimensional

145

poverty index /margination index, we constructed two directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), one for

146

each latency period as the outcome and multidimensional poverty index /margination index as the

147

main exposure (Appendix Figure 1). In these causal models, multidimensional poverty index

148

/margination index were considered as the same variable. The proportion of point-of-care tests

149

across margination status was calculated for Mexico to determine accessibility to said tests

150

beginning in November 15th, 2020, the date in which these tests started to be performed.

151

Colombia did not have the data to make this calculation.

152

All analyses were done with R version 4.0.0. DAGs were built with the daggitty open software

153

(15). Data used in the analysis is freely available in respective government websites (9, 10), and

154

code used in the analysis will be made available in the final version. The study was approved by

155

the ethics board of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán.

Characteristics of datasets

159

Only datasets from Mexico and Colombia met inclusion criteria (9, 10). Open data included

160

different information for each country. Only confirmed cases were available for Colombia, while

161

all tested people were available for Mexico. People were registered in the Colombian database

162

from March 2nd 2020, and the study period had to be limited until July 27th because antigen tests

163

began to be reported starting July 28th with no distinction between positive cases by RT-PCR or

164

antigen tests. Mexico does not provide a testing nor a diagnosis date. Testing date was assumed

165

to be that in which an individual first appeared in a database. As these individuals are included

166

with a “pending result” in the result variable, we consider this to be reasonable.

167

Colombia had a total of 327,366 reported positive individuals from April 1st until August 9th (date

168

in which the last positive test taken during the period in which only RT-PCR were performed was

169

reported) and Mexico had 3,363,456 RT-PCR tested individuals from April 12th 2020 until

170

January 31st 2021 until, of which 3,214,281 had an available result by February 10th and 151,671

171

had more than 10 days since their test was taken and no available result.

172
173

Time between symptoms onset and testing (latency one)

174

According to our DAG (Appendix Figure 1), the total effect of multidimensional poverty index

175

/margination index on latency one or latency two can be directly estimated by stratification on

176

this variable as the backdoor criterion is satisfied (15).

177

In Colombia, median latency one was 3 days long (IQR 0-6), latency two 7 days (IQR 4-11), and

178

total latency 12 days (IQR 7-15). In Mexico the corresponding values were 3 days (IQR 1-5), 4

179

days (IQR 3-6), and 8 days (5-12). Latency periods by country and margination quintiles are

180

shown in Table 1. Over time, latency one remained stable during the study period in Mexico. In

181

Colombia, it had an initial peak at the beginning of the study period but decreased soon and

182

remained stable time in Colombia (Figure 1). Length of latency one was similar across

183

margination status in both countries while latency two was markedly higher in places with worse

184

margination in Colombia, but not in Mexico (Table 1, Appendix Figure 2).

185
186

Time between testing and test result report (latency two)

187

Latency two was much longer than latency one in both countries, causing the lengthiest delay in

188

tests result reports. While there was a tendency towards the reduction of latency two in Mexico

over time (interrupted by a huge peak in October-November 2020), the length of latency two

190

increase over time in Colombia (Figure 1). We observed a clear tendency towards a lengthier

191

latency two in the lowest quintiles of margination status indicators in Colombia but not in

192

Mexico. The number and proportion of performed tests that were point-of-care in Mexico was

193

lower in the worst margination quintiles across the study period, even if by the end the percentage

194

was similar across quintiles (Table 2, Figure 2).

Figures for the moving mean of latency one, latency two and total latency stratified by state,

Discussion

201

The pandemic has caused a delay in healthcare provision in patients suffering non-covid related

202

illnesses (16), but delays in patients with COVID-19 symptoms have not been thoroughly

203

described. The time between symptoms onset and the first medical visit and sampling for tests

204

could be determined by multiple factors such as symptoms severity, individual seeking health

205

behavior, geographic access, and socioeconomic status, among others. After sample collection,

206

test turnaround might depend also on geographic access but we assume that mainly on laboratory

207

capacity and administrative procedures. Delays at each timepoint might be corrected or

208

improved with specific strategies aiming to optimize the use of SARS-CoV-2 screening tests

209

results for clinical case identification and isolation during the estimated period of infectiousness.

210

We used this framework to describe the length of time between symptoms onset, testing and

211

sample processing, and test result report for SARS-CoV-2 and its association with socioeconomic

212

status in Colombia and Mexico. We observed that the median time between symptoms onset and

213

tests results report exceeds that of infectiousness in both countries. There is an overall poor use of

214

resources that depends to a great extent in a delay in tests results reporting after sample collection

215

(latency two period). Most people were early testers, more so in Colombia than in Mexico, with

216

considerable heterogeneity according to state. This supports the fact that testing strategies are not

217

“one fit all”, and should be tailored according to each regions requirement. The presence of “local

218

epidemics” as a way of expressing how different geographic areas are impacted differently, has

219

been previously described (5, 17, 18).

220

Interestingly we found longer latency two in areas with less margination in Mexico, but longer in

221

Colombia. This could be due to the higher use of POC tests in Mexico, and thus we are only

222

observing RT-PCR tested patients, as well as the sole use of RT-PCR tests in Colombia during

223

the selected study period. Since latency one was short and remained constant over time and

11
224

across margination status, interventions to increase access to tests across the whole population,

225

while important to test more people, are less likely to have an impact in reducing delays in the

226

diagnostic process, as the main component of the delay is the prolonged latency two.

227

As Mexico started using antigen tests during the late second half of 2020, we explored if these

228

were being performed preferably in vulnerable areas. Even if by the end of the study period the

229

percentage of POC tests was similar between margination quintiles, the number of tests varied

230

greatly, as only 18.4% of all POC tests were performed in the lower two quintiles. This is

231

considering a similar number of people was tested among all quantiles. Thus, this reveals under

232

testing in those most vulnerable and an unequal distribution of a valuable resource. This adds

233

another layer to the mortality disparity seen among private and public healthcare systems in

234

Mexico (19).

235

Pont-of-care antigen tests have been proposed as an effective strategy for epidemiologic

236

surveillance. While their sensitivity is lower than RT-PCR tests (83-93% according to the

237

Institute of Diagnosis and Epidemiological Reference in Mexico), their results are immediate,

238

and their low cost easily permits repeated testing (20). Repeated testing of antigen tests has been

239

shown to increase sensitivity in comparison with a one-time RT-PCR (21). An important

240

argument against antigen tests is their lower sensitivity compared to RT-PCR tests. Proposed

241

strategies based on antigen tests include repeated testing due to their low cost. For argument’s

242

sake, even if we considered this 10% of patients as “lost” (which would imply no repeat testing)

243

these patients would sum 1,787,732 infectious days (considering an average of 12 infectious days

244

per person), and with the current strategy a total of 5,633,261 infectious per days are undetected

245

solely because of latency two, three times as much.

246

Our study has several limitations. It is observational and used repurposed data, and as such it is

247

difficult to ascertain the precision of initial symptom date and diagnosis date, but both countries

12
248

use this data to make public health decisions and thus our results are applicable. The fact that

249

Colombia does not share information on every tested individual is also a limitation, as positive

250

individuals in that country could arrive at a different time to testing, even if our exploratory

251

analysis in Mexico does not show this. Selection bias might also present, since both countries do

252

only limited testing, with Mexico testing only one of 10 ambulatory patients and all hospitalized.

253

We are unable to make conclusions regarding symptomatic patients who do not search for care

254

and asymptomatic individuals, as they are not included in the open data (22). This could

255

evidently influence either people’s ability to get tested and the laboratory’s speed to give results,

256

but this is precisely our point. These variables are not accounted for in current testing strategies at

257

both of these countries, and low testing efficiency is a side effect of this.

258

Our study also has several strengths. It conveys information of two countries and a large number

259

of individuals during a significant proportion of the pandemic. Even if data is repurposed, the

260

main variables should not have recall bias affect them in a meaningful way as it is routine

261

information. Thus, diagnostic delays can be adequately quantified. Also, our use of DAGs makes

262

our thought process transparent on estimating variable effect on testing delays.

263

The low efficiency of RT-PCR observed in our study supports points to the need of improve the

264

efficiency of sample processing and test results reporting. Antigen tests for epidemiological

265

COVID-19 surveillance might contribute to reduce the time between sample collection and test

266

result delivery. Our results also indicate that efforts and resources should be more heavily

267

invested in high margination areas and populations, which would make resource allocation more

268

efficient.
