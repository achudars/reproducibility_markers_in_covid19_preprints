Abstract

Covid-19 disease outspread and its subsequent control and inhibition strategies in various
countries have been different which led to quite drastic difference in the outcome of the disease
progression. In this paper we present an analytical and numerical study of Covid-19 disease
spread and control by applying the modified SIR model of epidemic outbreak to explain the
Covid spread from February-July 2020 in various countries. Two approaches are evident from
the disease progression; one focused on disease eradication and inhibition, and the other is less
restrictive dynamic response. Both the approaches are analytically modeled to determine the
parameters that characterize the effectiveness of dealing with the disease progression. The model
successfully explains the Covid-19 evolution and control of various countries over a vast span of
four-five months. The study is highly beneficial to simply analytically and numerically model
this complex problem of epidemic proliferation. It assists to easily determine the mathematical
parameters for the Covid-19 control measures, helps in predicting the end of the epidemic, and
most importantly conceiving the judicious way of unlock process to restore communication
between cities, states and countries.
Key words: Covid-19, SIR model, epidemic model, lock down, control and inhibition of Covid-19

Introduction
The entire world continues to be severely affected by the global corona-virus pandemic Covid-19
which is a severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-COV-2). After the first
case was reported in Wuhan China on December 2019, the epidemic has spread rapidly to almost
each and every country of the world [1, 2]. In addition to the fatality of the disease, it is also
highly communicable in nature and that has put unimaginable stress to the existing health
facilities which needs to be upgraded rapidly to cope up with the spread. Since the reproduction
number of Covid-19 is high very soon the hospitals of major cities of the world of many
countries started becoming overloaded with Covid patients. The mortality from Covid-19
becomes more, from the shortage of ventilator systems or ICU for people with severe respiratory
symptoms apart from vulnerable people with precondition. Even before the international flights
could be banned or restricted, people be tested or quarantined, many countries started showing
Covid patients from the beginning of the year 2020. Due to lack of testing facilities, proper
protective kits and equipments and respiratory aids and known medicine, eventually all the
countries imposed lockdowns of various degree of severity, promoted social distancing, Covid19 awareness, encouraged and implemented overall hygiene and hand sanitization [3,
4].Unprecedented threat to public health, the huge disruptive impact on economy and redefining
social interaction norms jeopardizes the overall subsistence and welfare of human kind. While
scientists of many countries are fervently trying to find cure and vaccine for the deadly virus,
though its discovery, testing, validation, production and distribution to everyone will take many
months. Thus every nation is currently managing this disaster using a vigilant approach in
adopting, analytical assessment of ongoing situation, strategically formulating ways to save lives
as well as finding ways for mitigating its impact on economy. Some countries have been able to
bring the situation under control and were able to decrease the infection (China, South Korea,
Iran, Turkey etc.) by very strict approach. Some countries were able to control the disease where
the number of cases was not allowed to increase after attaining a maximum value (Russia,
France, Canada etc).Many countries like USA, India etc. are now trying to contain the disease
spread and active cases are still on surge, though recoveries are also showing improvement and
in near future control may be expected [5,6].To tackle the disaster it is important to know the
disease spreading characteristics like Reproduction number, recovery rate, fatality, symptoms
and associated complications, diagnostic and cure. Over the course of few months of the

outbreak of Covid-19 a lot of data and information is now known regarding the epidemic. It is
important to formulate strategies based on analytical, mathematical and numerical modeling to
suggest effcetive lockdown measures [7, 13]. It is also crucial to predict time for infection to
peak, maximum infection, and the end of epidemic. Quantifying the government restriction and
social awareness and diseases prevention response of society is yet another important
requirement [2]. The unlock policies based on the analysis of epidemic progression in various
regions, cities, states and countries is also a matter of grave importance. It may be pointed here
that a very simple yet effective mathematical model of infection kinetic very well simulated and
explained Covid-19 progression in various Chinese provinces [14]. However the simplistic
model did not include recoveries, active cases and the model was independent of the population
of the region. Therefore in this paper we extended the mathematical formulation of Liang et.al.
[13].Using the SIR model (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) and modifying it to include the
total population of the region, recoveries and quantifying the restrictive and preventive measures
of the government and people. We present an analytical and numerical study of Covid-19 spread
in a local region for different type of approach to prevent the diseases spread. The epidemic
prevention can be gradual and dynamic or a rigid preventive measure may be taken. The prior
approach is suitable and less restrictive which allows selected movement depending on the
present scenario (number of infected people at that moment). This eases economic activity to
continue in a dynamically restricted manner. The other approach of absolute rigid measures may
be little more effective for control of disease but is economically detrimental. In addition the
unlock procedure that is restoring communication between two regions (cities, states or
countries) can be easily made based on the quantification of how Covid spread is controlled or
inhibited in a region. The regions with similar value or close values of transmission control
parameters pose low risk when the movement restrictions are lifted between them. Promoting
awareness through, dynamic communication using electronic and print media, smart and agile
administration, authentic data sharing and upkeep, collective discipline and adherence to
physical distancing and hygiene are instrumental for ensuring the disease control and inhibition
and also for preventing mortality.

The Analytical Model (modified SIR)
We first outline the basic equation of the well know SIR model. Let NT be the total
population of a place or a region be it a small zone of outbreak, city, state or a country. Let at
time t=t0the initial number of Susceptibles be S0, Initial number of Infected be I0 and Initial
Recovered be R0 which is in general zero initially , thus S0+I0+R0=NT (Assuming negligible
number of births and deaths during a few months span of time). Similarly instantaneous number
of Susceptible S(t), Infected I(t) and Recovered R(t)or (removed ) at any time follow
S(t)+I(t)+R(t)=NT. The three coupled rate equations are outlined

Here b is the transmission rate and r0 is the recovery rate. These terminologies erstwhile
restricted to books and journals, has now found prominence to a wide audience world over one
of them is R0 or the reproduction number which depends on the infection rate and recovery rate
in a population zone. The normalized quantities s =S/NT, i=I/NT, r=R/NT. We take two forms of
b

The disease is said to be controlled when active cases start decreasing after attaining a peak value
im. The dI/dt value is zero at im , it’s value in general is positive initially during spread and is
negative during contol. The fall may be sharp or gradual and in some cases the fall is extremely
shallow that the “I” value seems to be almost constant. The epidemic prevention can be rigid and
inhibitive depends on the equation 4a) which is more suitable for analysis. Since i+r is the
cumulative cases it always increases so “b” value continues to attain smaller values. This
approach of absolute rigid measures may be little more effective for control of disease but is

economically detrimental due to increasingly stringent restrictions. On the other hand prevention
of disease can be gradual and dynamic then equation 4b) is more suitable for analysis. This
approach is suitable and less restrictive which allows selective movement depending on the
present scenario (number of infected people at that moment). This eases economic activity to
continue in a dynamically restricted manner. Majorly the approach used to control the disease is
based on the concern of fatalities and over loading of health facilities due to Covid-19 as well as
optimizing the economic challenges that the lockdowns and social distancing has brought along.
This means the value of im should be much less that 0.001 (this number depends on available
health resources) at any given situation. The whole optimization process makes this restriction of
maximum number of cases the top most priority.
Results and discussion

Fig.1 shows the basic curve for SIR model where time evolution in days are shown for fraction of
Susceptible s(t), infected i(t) and recovered r(t) fraction in the total population NT. The typical
values are b0=0.5 and r0=0.1, and a population NT of 1 crore.

typical values are b0=0.5 r0=0.1 and a population NT of 1 crore (Here c and C are zero i.e
infection control or inhibition is independent of the currently infected or cumulative cases). The
number of susceptible decreases sharply after some time and then saturates, similarly the
recovered fraction increase rapidly after some days and saturates later. The number of infected
(Active cases) increases monotonically first then shows a maximum value of im (maximum
infected fraction) at a time Tp and then decreases monotonically. The time where the infected
remains only 1% of the im value may be termed as Te(in graph it is shown as Te).

Fig.2 shows the major inferences that can be drawn from the SIR model like predicting the
infection peak time, maximum fraction of infected im, and end of epidemic. The population of
regions of outbreak of infectious disease is chosen from a small community value to large city
population. Fig. 2a) time of infection peaking Tp as a function of infection parameter b. Fig. 2 b)
max fraction of infection im decreases monotonically on decreasing band is independent of the

The Fig.2 shows the most important conclusions that can be drawn from the SIR model (using
only equation 1 to 3) like predicting the infection peak time, maximum fraction of infected im,
and end of epidemic (infected remains only 1% of the im value) all as function of b (infection
transmission rate). The range of values of infection rate is along the X axis. The infection rate of
different disease is different highly communicable and infectious have larger b values. “b” can
also be changed by implementing, lock downs, social distancing and other restrictive means. The
typical value of recovery rate r0=0.1 and the population of regions of outbreak of infectious
disease are chosen from a small community value to large city population where

NT=103,105,106of 5*106. This is to bring out the role of total population in disease spread and
how the time evolution depends on the population of the region chosen. Here again c and C are
taken zero i.e infection control or inhibition is independent of the currently infected or
cumulative cases. Fig. 2a) time of infection peaking Tp as a function of infection parameter, b.
The value of Tp monotonically decreases for all population with increasing b. The value of Tp is
considerably low for lower population region and lower values of b. At high b values and high
population Tp becomes almost same. Thus it may be concluded that on imposing restrictions and
lock down the b value is small (b <1) and Tp is much less for low population zones. Thus red
containment zones in lockdown is a very effective and fast way to achieve inhibition and control
so the disease spread may be contained easily. It is also seen from Fig. 2 b) that the max fraction
of infection decreases monotonically on decreasing b (lockdown and social distancing). This is
the most important reason for imposing lock downs for a manageable situation ideally im should
be<<0.001. This means only a few people are infected even at peak so that health facility may be
available and casualties can be avoided. It may be noted that such a condition can only be
obtained by a high degree of awareness by people where they voluntarily maintain social
distance, hygiene and remained confined and restricted; only then b will start approaching r0 and
the disease spread may be inhibited and restricted to a small extent. It is seen that im is
independent of the population of the zone from Fig. 2 b). Thus the disease spreads like a wave
and for similar condition of b and r0, im remains same irrespective of the population of the region.
Fig. c) shows the time of end of epidemic Te as a function of infection parameter b. The value of
Te monotonically decreases for all population with increasing b. The value of Te is considerably
low for lower population region and lower values of b. Again high b values and high population
Te becomes almost same. Thus it may be concluded that on imposing restrictions and lock down
the b value is small (b <1) Tp and Te is much less for low population zones. Thus red containment
zones in lockdowns are a very effective and fast way to eradicate the disease.

implemented and followed for a period of nearly 5 months. The dynamics is easily modeled by
simple analytical forms over a very long period of time and is testimony to the fact the action of
government and people have followed the same behavior over a prolonged period of time.

here m=0.125. A vigilant restrictive disease control regimen was implemented and followed for a
period of more than two months. The deviation of reported data from the model beyond 70 days
clearly shows a lifting of restrictions and therefore the chosen form of infection has to be
modified. Yet again the epidemic dynamics is easily modeled by simple analytical forms over a
substantial period of time.

Fig. 5) the progression of Covid -19 Active cases time line in Italy since Feb15, 2020 when 3
cases were reported. The active case or infection fraction are plotted with days (up to 140 days)
peaked at 66 days. The actual data shows a steep rise in the infection and control measures seems
to be inadequate. Infact after the surge of Covid cases the government of Italy went in to lock
down on March 9, 2020 [3]. Since then gradually the strict government action combined with
considerable awareness amongst the people the disease was brought under control after peaking
at 66 days. It is therefore quite clear that the reported data is well simulated by the analytical and
numerical model only after some time, when the extreme measures were implemented. The
analytical form of infection transmission parameter is B=B0-C(i+r)m, where m=0.125. A vigilant
restrictive disease control regimen was implemented as well as people adopted social distancing
norms which followed for a period of about 3 months. The coincidence of reported data from the
model from 50-140 days after the outbreak clearly shows that the epidemic dynamics is easily
modeled by the above mentioned simple analytical form.

It is important to know the effect of lockdowns and social distancing on peak time of infection,
end of epidemic and maximum fraction of infected people. The Fig.8) shows a summary of
effectiveness of infection inhibition parameter C. Peak time of infection, end of epidemic and
maximum fraction of infected people are calculated from the modified SIR model with the
modified infection transmission is taken of the form B=B0-C(i+r) which depends on the
cumulative cases (active cases+ recovered cases). This form is a restrictive and inhibitive form of
response combining both government and public response. The population chosen is 1 crore and
typical values of B0=0.4 and r0=0.1 from the general available Covid progression data. The peak
time Tp slightly decreases on increasing C (infection inhibition) thereafter almost becomes
constant. This clearly shows no matter how large C is chosen it has no impact on the Tp.
Similarly Te gradually and very slowly decrease with increasing C. This again shows the end of

epidemic time cannot be brought by more and and more inhibition and restriction, that is
increasing C does not have much impact on ending the epidemic. Yet it may be pointed C is very
crucial to control the maximum infected fraction im. An increase in C causes a sharp decrease in
im and then gradually the decrease in im becomes less. Therefore the increasing C beyond a
certain degree is not very beneficial. Since a very high value of C is detrimental for the minimum
social interaction for economic and livelihood activities, it does not affect Tp and Te and im does
not get significantly reduced. Ideally im less than 10-3(depending on health care resources of the
region) would be manageable to provide hospitalization for ventilators or ICU.

inhibitive. “The so called living with disease mode” form of response combining both
government and public response is better described by the above form of infection transmission

parameter. The population chosen is 1 crore and typical values of b0=0.4 and r0=0.1. The
maximum infection time Tm almost constant and does not vary much with the increasing value of
c, the infection control parameter. This clearly shows no matter how large C is chosen it has no
impact on the Tm. An increase in C causes a sharp decrease in im and then gradually the decrease
in im becomes less. Therefore the increasing C beyond aa certain degree is not very beneficial.
As mentioned earlier very high value of C is detrimental for economic activities. The value of c
must be chosen such that im much less than 10-3 (depending on health care resources of the
region). So social activities may be allowed restrictively while minimizing the life threatening
outcome to the best possible extent. Similarly in contrast to Fig.8 Te gradually and
monotonically increases with increasing c implying disease stay for a long time. Eventually C is
very crucial to control the maximum infected fraction im.

observation that the Covid spread was controlled and inhibited and there was a decrease in

values is ensured but the trend of reported data and model match only partially.

Using the modified SIR model for prediction of Covid-19 progression in India
At last we do a bit of predictive analysis for Covid-19 progression in India. Similar studies have
been done in great detail using different analytical models for India and its constituent states [2123] Various countries like USA , India, Brazil etc. are witnessing a surge of Covid infected
patients every day and the disease peak has not yet been reached. India’s fight against Covid is
being eyed closely since it is a country with a large population of 135 crore and it also has huge
population density. Thus Covid poses a great threat to health of Indian people as well as has
repercussions for a setback to the economy. However, the Indian government has implemented
timely action through a strict lock down witnessing closure of transport networks, public
gatherings, religious places, Schools, Restaurants etc. There were various phases of Lock down
1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 starting from 25 March 2020 -31 May 2020. The unlock process started
mildly and gradually from June 1, 2020 and unlocking is continuing with various restrictions. In
such a dynamic scenario the prediction of disease progression is difficult yet a few inferences
can be made from the available data till date where both the government and public social

distance response is estimated. Based on which the arrival of peak and the maximum number of
people expected to be infected can be predicted. The Figure 10 shows the spread of Covid-19 in
India since March 03, 2020 when 3 cases were reported. The reported data available till July 23,
2020 is fitted with modified SIR model with B=B0-C(i+r)m,with B0=0.25 , C=0.26 and m=0.125.
The lower figure is a zoomed version of the above figure. The peak is expected near October end
of 2020. The effect of unlock and overlooking social distancing can have a highly damaging
consequence to the people of India. If B0 is increased to 0.3 while keeping C=0.26 the maximum
number of infected at peak are more than 1%. If B0 is kept at 0.25 and C reduced to 0.2 the peak
may be expected in November end, with about 1% of population being infected at peak. If both
government and people relax the disease inhibition measures by increasing B0 to 0.3 and
decreasing C simultaneously to 0.2, the situation will become worse and 5% people may be
affected. Therefore it can be concluded that the commendable effort of government and vigilant
approach of people of India till now, must be continued at all expense to keep the situation under
control.

Fig.10)The Covid-19 progression in India since March 03, 2020 when 3 cases were reported.
The reported data available till July 23, 2020 is fitted with modified SIR model with B=B0C(i+r)m,with B0=0.25 and C=0.26. The lower figure is a zoomed version of the above figure. The
peak is expected near October end of 2020.

The effect of unlock and overlooking social

distancing can have a highly damaging consequence to the people of India. The commendable
effort of government and people must be continued to keep situation under control.

Conclusions
In conclusion following points are outlined which summarizes the major results and inferences
of the analysis presented in this paper based on reported Covid -19 data.
1) The modified SIR model used in this work explains the time for infection to peak,
maximum infection, the end of epidemic as well as helps in quantifying the government
restriction and social awareness and disease prevention response of society.
2) The Covid-19 epidemic proliferation dynamics is modeled using analytical and numerical
means using two major forms of time dependent infection rate. In first scenario a strict
restrictive regimen is imposed for disease inhibition and eradication (China, Italy,
Turkey) and in the second control is achieved in a more relaxed manner where the active
cases are not let to grow any further after reaching a maximum value (France,
Russia,Canada). The first approach is a lot more challenging and taxing for the economy
and social activities. The other approach is more relaxed where a smart and dynamic way
is adopted by the government and people to safeguard economy while ensuring the
control of disease spread. Both these approaches are numero-analytically modeled and
explained in detail the reported Covid-19 data recorded over a period of 5 months.
3) The model clearly brings out the role of controlling the disease in localized region with
lower population and indicates that awareness, accurate information of local outbreak and
the subsequent preventive measures are keys to fight the disease spread while keeping the
economic activities on the move, of course with restrictions.
4) The unlock procedure can be easily made based on the quantification (estimating the b0
and c or B0 and C values for a particular region) of how Covid spread is controlled or

inhibited in a region. This implies starting of communication between large regions of a
city, between cities, between states and between countries. The regions with similar value
or close values of disease inhibition or control parameters are in principal compatible and
least risk of worsening the situation in the regions is expected when the movement
restrictions between them are lifted.
5) Increasing awareness, fast communication, smart and dynamic administration, authentic
data sharing and upkeep, coherent discipline and adherence to social distancing and
hygiene and sanitization are the key for ensuring the disease control and inhibition and
for preventing mortality.
