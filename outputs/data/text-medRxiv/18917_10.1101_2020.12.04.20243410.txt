Rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 became available recently, offering an opportunity to vastly
increase testing capacities. Antigen tests offer lower sensitivity than the gold standard, RT-PCR, but
rapid sample-to-answer time. High-frequency testing with an antigen test may offset the lower
sensitivity, and testing can be done with at-home collection of samples, offering potential benefit in
screening efforts. In this study, we set out to evaluate the practical application of self-performed highfrequency antigen test in a school setting.

A total of 711 teachers from 86 schools were enrolled in a seven-week study. After instruction,
participants tested themselves every 48 hours at home with a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2
(target: nucleocapsid protein) in a self-collected anterior nasal swab. Positive results in the antigen test
were confirmed via RT-PCR from the same sample that had been determined to be positive by the
study participant. A questionnaire was given to all participants to evaluate whether the test failed to
detect infection.

10 836 tests from 602 teachers were recorded and analyzed. A total of five confirmed cases of viral
shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by use of the antigen test. One study participant with a SARSCoV-2 infection was presymptomatic and four were mildly symptomatic at the time of the antigen test.
Sixteen false positive antigen tests (0.15% of all tests) were reported, predominantly when the local
incidence in the general population was low. In four cases, the study participant reported that a PCR
had detected a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the antigen test was negative, indicating a false negative
result.

High-frequency, self-performed rapid antigen tests can detect individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and therefore potentially reduce transmissions. Testing may be most beneficial when applied during
high local incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and when mild or atypical symptoms are present. To
avoid a high rate of false positive results, a test with optimized specificity should be used.

Introduction

46

a highly sensitive and specific method to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) are also

47

becoming increasingly available and offer point-of-care testing, with results available within minutes.

48

These tests, that are much more affordable and offer the potential of increasing testing capacities as

49

well as reducing sample-to-answer-time, are limited by a lower sensitivity and specificity when

50

compared to PCR.1-3 However, the sensitivity of RATs may be sufficient to detect most infectious cases2,

51

especially when testing is performed in high frequency.4,5 RATs are usually very simple to perform, and

52

can be combined with self-sampling, to offer at-home testing for non-medical professionals. When

53

using a RAT to test for SARS-CoV-2, anterior nasal swabs have been shown to be a viable alternative to

54

oropharyngeal or throat swabs, when collected by a medical professional,1 as well as when the sample

55

was self-collected by a non-medical professional.3,6-8

56

High-frequency testing for SARS-CoV-2 with an RAT is proposed to make some critical environments

57

safer during the pandemic when other non-pharmaceutical interventions are not sufficient to prevent

58

transmissions. Theoretical models have proposed that high-frequency antigen testing may be

59

efficacious to reduce transmissions in such environments.5,9 Keeping schools open during the

60

pandemic should be considered a high priority due to potentially detrimental effects of withholding

61

education from children of various age groups. Here, the application of rapid antigen tests could prove

62

to be beneficial.

63

There is limited experience from real-life application of RATs, especially when testing is performed by

64

a non-medical professional without supervision. The primary aim of this study was to determine

65

whether at-home testing results in true-positive detection of unknown viral shedding.

66
67

In the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, test strategies continue to rely mostly on real time (RT-) PCR,

detection of SARS-CoV-2) set out to evaluate the practical application of self-testing for SARS-CoV-2

71

with a RAT, performed by teachers. The primary goal of the study was to evaluate the potential of an

72

RAT to detect SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and thus to enable necessary infection control

73

measures.

74

Teachers from primary and secondary schools in three distinct school districts were invited by the

75

Hessian Ministry of Education to participate in the study. The study period was seven weeks, of which

76

three were before and four were after a two-week autumn vacation in Hesse (September 14th to

77

October 4thnd and October 17th to November 15th, 2020).

78

Study participants received written instructions, as well as an instructional video on how to collect an

79

anterior nasal swab, and step-by-step instruction to perform and read out an RAT (RIDA® QUICK SARS-

80

CoV-2 Antigen test, R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany) at home. In the testing process, two reagents

81

were combined with drop bottles, the nasal swabs were irrigated in medium, and a predetermined

82

amount of this sample was transferred to the testing tube with the reagents using a single-use pipet.

83

After 10 minutes of incubation, a lateral flow test strip was added to the test tube. The visual result

84

readout was performed after an additional 10 minutes. Study participants were instructed to observe

85

whether the control band was visible to determine the validity of the result, and to determine whether

86

the test band was visible to determine a positive (test band visible) or negative (test band not visible)

87

result. Study participants were instructed to record all tests on a standardized form.

88

Study participants were provided with the telephone number to the study hotline as well as a

89

designated email address in case any support was needed. In case of positive or inconclusive test

90

readouts, participants were asked to call the study hotline for further instructions. When a sample was

91

deemed or suspected to be positive by the study participant, the sample medium from which material

92

was inserted into the antigen test by the study participant was collected. In the laboratory (Institute

93

for Medical Virology, Goethe University Frankfurt), a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed, using either

94

Roche Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), Alinity m® SARS-CoV-2 Assay

95

(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) or Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA,

96

USA). The study participants were asked to self-quarantine until PCR results were conveyed.

97

At the end of the study, all participants received a questionnaire to determine whether they

98

encountered any difficulty in the testing procedure, and to record whether they were diagnosed with

99

a SARS-CoV-2 infections but were tested negative with the RAT.

Results

109

Characterization of study participants

110

711 teachers participated in the study. A total of 602 teachers (86.7%) from 85 schools provided

111

records from the RATs. The age range was 21 to 67 years. A total of 10 836 tests were recorded (mean:

112

18 tests per study participant). 10 768 of these tests (99.37%) were recorded to have been valid and

113

negative, 47 (0.43%) were recorded as invalid and 21 (0.19%) as positive (either true or false).

114

True positive results

115

A true positive antigen test result was confirmed by RT-PCR in five teachers during the study period

116

(table 1). A prior or ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not known in any of these participants at

117

the time of the antigen test. All five true positive cases occurred when the local 7-day incidence in the

118

school district was higher than 100 cases / 100 000 inhabitants (mean 7-day incidence at the time of

119

true positive test result: 252.66 cases / 100 000 inhabitants). At the time of testing, four of them were

120

symptomatic, and one was presymptomatic. No asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 was

121

detected in this study. The Cycle-threshold (Ct) values for the five RAT-positive samples ranged 17.6

122

and 20.2.

123

False positive results

124

In 16 cases, a positive RAT result was determined by the study participant but could not be confirmed

125

by RT-PCR. 13 of these tests were conducted when the 7-day local incidence was below 40 cases / 100

126

000 inhabitants, and three occurred with a 7-day local incidence between 171 and 213 cases / 100 000

127

inhabitants. 12 of the 16 false positive tests occurred while the study participant was asymptomatic,

128

and four while symptoms were reported by the study participant (table 1). In 10 of these 16 cases, the

129

false positive result occurred in the very first test the teacher performed.

130

Protein A of Staphylococcus aureus and other coagulase positive Staphylococcus species are known to

131

bind the Fc region of IgG and which can lead to false positive reactions in lateral flow test systems.10

132

Therefore, seven false positive anterior nasal swab samples were analyzed for the presence of S.

133

aureus by culture and PCR (target sequence: nuc and MREJ). Six out of seven samples were positive by

134

PCR and four out of seven samples were culture-positive.

135

False negative results

136

For four teachers, a false negative result in the antigen test was assumed, as they reported to have

137

received a positive test result by SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a swab that had been collected by a medical

138

professional during the time of high-frequency self-testing with the RAT. Three of these events

139

occurred during high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 (171, 213 and 253 cases / 100 000 inhabitants,

140

respectively). Two of these study participants were symptomatic and one was presymptomatic at the

141

time of the positive PCR test result (table 1). For one case it was not reported when the false negative

142

test occurred, and if symptoms were present. In one case, the RAT later was positive seven days after

143

the RT-PCR result.

Discussion

149

to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools.

150

The test used in this study is a lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test. While the overall sensitivity

151

of this test was only 50.0 to 77.6% in a recent study, it was 88.2% when samples were used with Ct

152

values below 28, a range that is typically seen during the first week of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, when

153

the patient is likely infectious. Cumulative specificity for the test has been reported to be 94.85%.11

154

The objective of the study was to determine whether at-home testing results in true-positive detection

155

of unknown viral shedding, causing the potentially infectious teacher to become aware of an infection

156

with SARS-CoV-2, and therefore preventing potential transmissions in school. This outcome was

157

archived in five out of 602 study participants. These individuals had a high viral load in the self-collected

158

nasal swab (Ct values 17.6 to 20.2), indicating they were likely infectious. Possible onward

159

transmissions in the school or in a private setting may have been prevented. All but one of these

160

participants were mildly symptomatic at the time of testing, but only one reported fever at the time

161

of testing. This demonstrates that RAT testing is especially useful when symptoms are present, even in

162

the absence of fever. In one case, headache and fatigue were the only reported symptoms, which

163

highlights the need to test for SARS-CoV-2 even in cases with symptoms that are very prevalent in the

164

general population that may not be immediately attributed to COVID-19.

165

A total of 16 false positive results were recorded by the study participants. Notably, 13 of the 16 false

166

positive tests occurred while the local 7-day incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was below 100 cases

167

/ 100 000 inhabitants, demonstrating the implications of a low positive predictive value of the RAT

168

during low infection prevalence. To avoid the occurrence of false positive results, large-scale testing

169

could be applied during periods of high incidence, and a test with higher specificity should be used in

170

such screening efforts.

171

In this study, the test material was a nasal swab, which is demonstrated to offer high diagnostic

172

sensitivity, which could also be demonstrated for self-collected samples by non-medical

173

professionals.3,6,7 We observed 16 false positive results; however, when compared to the total number

174

of study participants, this occurred only in 2.66% of all study participants. As anticipated, the rate of

175

false positive results decreased with a rising prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 that occurred throughout the

176

study period (table 1). The decrease in the false positivity rate may also indicate that false positive

177

results occurred due to a permanent host factor that resulted in these study participants to drop out

178

of the study as it progressed. One such conceivable factor is the nasal colonization with Staphylococcus

179

aureus, which could result in false positive result due to interference with the lateral flow assay

We evaluated the practical application of at-home, high-frequency RATs for SARS-CoV-2 by teachers

180

through the binding of immunoglobulin by staphylococcal protein A (SpA).12 Indeed, in six out of seven

181

false positive samples, the presence of Staphylococcus aureus could be confirmed.

182

When reviewing the records, very few tests yielded an invalid result (47 out of 10 836 tests, 0.43%),

183

indicating that the RAT could be performed satisfactory by the study participants, who could call a

184

hotline in case any technical or medical support was needed. It is imperative that, when the test is

185

performed without supervision of a medical professional, support is easily accessable.13

186

Presumably, four out of 10 836 tests were false negative, which might be due to insufficient swabbing

187

technique, an error in testing, result readout, or low viral load in anterior nasal sampling.

188

This study has several limitations. All participants were educators in primary or secondary schools, and

189

therefore had a higher education. Not all teachers at the schools that participated in the study

190

performed the test every 48 hours throughout the entire study period, and not all teachers from the

191

schools participated in the study. Furthermore, no students from these schools were tested, and

192

transmissions in the participating schools were not examined. As no students were enrolled in the

193

study, we also do now know whether the approach of high-frequency, self-performed testing is

194

beneficial in children.

195

In conclusion, we could demonstrate that a high frequency, self-performed antigen tests by teachers

196

can result in the detection of individuals who are probably infectious, and therefore could contribute

197

to making the school environment safer during the pandemic.

198

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is especially important when symptoms are present, which may also be mild or

199

atypical. As infections may also be missed by use of an antigen test, all non-pharmaceutical

200

interventions should be applied regardless of the use of rapid antigen tests.

201

The authors received positive feedback from the study participants throughout the study, a large

202

majority of whom experienced the study participation with regular testing for SARS-CoV-2 to be

203

reassuring when working in schools during the pandemic.
