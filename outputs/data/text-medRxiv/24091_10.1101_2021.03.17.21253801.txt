Abstract

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected medical practice, and changes in healthcare activities
were needed to minimize the overload and avoid healthcare systems collapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the impact of the pandemic on surgical procedures in Brazil.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a descriptive study of the number of hospitalizations for surgical procedures
in Brazil from 2016 to 2020. Data were collected from the Brazilian Department of Informatics of the Unified Health
System (DATASUS). Analyzes were performed according to the type of procedure, geographical region, subgroups
of surgical procedures, and the number of surgeries from 2020 were compared with the average from 2016 to
2019.
Results: There were 4,009,116 hospitalizations for surgical procedures in the Brazilian Public Health System in
2020. When comparing it to the average of hospitalizations from 2016-2019, there was a decrease of 14.88%
[95%IC (14.82-14.93)]. Decrease rates were 34.82% [95%IC (34.73-34.90)] for elective procedures and 1.11%
[95%IC (1.07-1.13)] for urgent procedures. Decrease rates were similar in all the five regions of the country
(average 14.17%). Surgical procedure subgroups with the highest decrease rates were endocrine gland surgery
(48.03%), breast surgery (40.68%), oral and maxillofacial surgery (37.03%), surgery of the upper airways, face,
head and neck (36.06%), and minor surgeries and surgeries of skin, subcutaneous tissue and mucosa (33.16%).
Conclusion: The overload of healthcare facilities has demanded a reduction of non-urgent activities to prevent a
collapse of healthcare systems, resulting in a decrease in elective surgeries. Recommendations about the
performance of surgical procedures were made, and continuous refinements of these recommendations are
encouraged.

1. Introduction

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei
Province of China [1,2]. The disease spread quickly: by the end of January 2020, it was stated as an

international public health emergency, and, in March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 as a pandemic [3,4].
Since the beginning of the outbreak, there was concern about the impact on healthcare systems.
Due to the risk of nosocomial transmission, possible lack of personal protective equipment (PPE),
overflow of healthcare facilities, and limited medical resources [5,6], there was a disruption in delivering
surgical care to millions of patients [7-9].
The relation between surgery and the outbreak is complex: the risk of exposure and nosocomial
infection is higher in the context of a surgical procedure; postoperative care may need hospitalization
and intensive care, thus reducing the availability of these supports to COVID-19 patients. Other
situations affecting surgical practice were also seen, such as the shortage of medications and blood
components [7,8].
In this context, many countries canceled elective procedures to redirect surgical resources and
workforce to COVID-19 patients [9-11]. Furthermore, considering that the healthcare professionals
could be at high risk of exposure to the virus during surgical procedures [12], specific institutional
protocols were developed for operating rooms depending on the type of surgery [13,14].
The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the COVID-10 pandemic on surgical
procedures in Brazil.

2. Materials and Methods

This was a descriptive study, based on publicly available data from the Brazilian Department of
Informatics of the Unified Health System (DATASUS), which includes only data from the Brazilian public
health system, collected in the public health information tab - TABNET.
Data from 2016 to 2020 were collected according to the procedure and Brazil's geographical
regions. Brazil is divided into five regions encompassing 27 federative units: North (seven federative
units); Northeast (nine federative units); Midwest (four federative units); Southeast (four federative
units); and South (three federative units) [15].
Data were also collected according to the type of procedure, which was classified in TABNET
as "elective procedure", "urgent procedure", "accident in the workplace or at the duty of a company",
"accident on the way to work", "other types of traffic accidents" and "other types of injury or poisoning
by chemical or physical agents". The last four were computed in a single group called "other
procedures".
Historical time series charts were performed by month and by year for the variables mentioned
above. For 2020, hospitalizations for total surgical procedures were listed per month and per region.
Analyses were performed by type of surgical procedure and by region, comparing the average of
hospitalizations rates from 2016 to 2019 with the hospitalization rates in 2020.
Surgical procedures subgroups were analyzed, comparing the averages of hospitalizations
from 2016 to 2019 with hospitalizations in 2020 to determine the subgroups most affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Analyses were performed in software R for statistical computing, version 4.0.3 (R Core Team,

Vienna, Austria). This article is compliant with the STROCSS criteria (Strengthening the reporting of
cohort studies in surgery).

3. Results

The number of hospitalizations for surgical procedures from 2016 to 2020 is shown in Table 1
and Figure 1, with temporal distribution of total, elective and urgent surgical procedures. There was an
increase in surgeries from 2016 to 2019, and a reduction in 2020. When comparing the average of
hospitalizations from 2016-2019 and the hospitalizations in 2020, there was a 14.88% reduction [95%IC
(14.82-14.93)] in total surgical procedures (Table 1). Elective procedures showed a greater decrease,
with 34.82% [95%IC (34.73-34.90)] less elective procedures and 1.11% [95%IC (1.07-1.13)] less urgent
procedures in 2020.

4. Discussion

The decision to perform surgeries in the face of the pandemic requires a thorough evaluation
to establish priorities and define precisely in which cases benefits overcome risks, and surgery is
genuinely needed [9,16]. This was a great challenge for surgeons in 2020, since avoiding unnecessary

activities in healthcare facilities, thus canceling or postponing all non-urgent procedures, was widely
stated as an important measure to prevent overload and enable reorganization of the healthcare
systems worldwide [9-11]. The Brazilian public health system adhered to these recommendations, as
shown by the decrease of elective surgeries in 2020 (34.82%) compared to the decline in urgent
procedures (1.1%).
When analyzing monthly surgical procedures in 2020, there was a remarkably low number of
surgeries between April and June, the months following the country's first reported cases, resuming
growth from July onwards. Indeed, regulatory measures must be more restrictive at the beginning of an
outbreak, when healthcare systems are unprepared to deal with a possible overload, so time is needed
until more health resources can be acquired [9,10]. There was a new reduction rate in December when
compared to the previous months. In the past years (2017-2019), there was a seasonal decrease in
hospitalizations for surgical procedures in November and December [17]. Still, the reduction in 2020
could also be attributed to the increase in COVID-19 cases that took part in Brazil in November [18].
Even though Brazil has considerable differences in public administration, heterogeneous
cultural and economic conditions across different regions, data shows similar reduction rates in
hospitalizations when comparing the rates in 2020 with the previous years, with an average reduction
of 18.96%. However, in the 2020 monthly comparison, there was a higher decrease rate in the North in
December when compared to the other regions. These reductions might have been the result of the
regional healthcare system collapse in December [19].
Surgical care that is not time-critical can be delayed to a later date when the pandemic
subsides. However, certain procedures must be performed even during a pandemic, such as cancer
treatment and urgent surgeries, as these are considered life-saving procedures [9]. This could explain
why oncology and thoracic surgeries suffered minor reductions in the ranking, while endocrine gland
surgery was the subgroup with the highest decrease rates (48.03%), probably due to the possibility of
safe deferral of these procedures [16,20,21].
Regarding plastic surgery, guidelines support the deferral of breast reconstruction and revision
procedures [22], which might explain the high decrease rates in breast surgery (40.68%). Other studies
have found that plastic surgery procedures most impacted by the pandemic were superficial skin lesions
and subcutaneous mass procedures [23], which corroborates our findings of high decrease rates in
minor surgeries and surgeries of skin, subcutaneous tissue and mucosa (33.16%).
Other subgroups with the highest decrease rates were oral and maxillofacial (37.3%) and upper
airways, head and neck (36.06%) surgeries. These procedures were of particular concern due to the
higher risk of generating aerosols. Guidelines recommend these surgeries should only be performed in
life-threatening conditions with great precautions due to the possibility of COVID-19 infection [22,24].
There were also important decrease rates among surgeries of the digestive system and
abdominal wall (30.16%), which may also reflect recommendations and alternative management of
digestive emergency conditions performed during the pandemic. Guidelines support that only lifethreatening gastrointestinal conditions should undergo surgery, and there were recommendations for
clinical treatment in conditions such as uncomplicated appendicitis and cholecystitis [17,23], situations
in which conservative management appears to be effective and reduce the length of hospital stay [25].

Cancer surgery was one of the challenges faced in the context of the pandemic. Since both
cancer and surgical patients are at high risk of COVID-19 infection and complications of the disease
[26-28], there was a concern involving the exposure of these patients to the hospital environment, and
most guidelines supported that surgeries should be delayed whenever possible. On the other hand,
there were concerns about the risks of postponing oncological procedures and the exposure of patients
undergoing conservative cancer treatment. The recommendation was that decisions should be made
based on the clinical condition and the pandemic's impact on the local healthcare system [22,27,28].
This study found only a 5.6% reduction in general oncological surgeries, which suggests that Brazil had
a trend in choosing for operation in most cancer cases.
Hospitalization rates for obstetric surgery were slightly higher in 2020 than the average from
2016 to 2019 (0.48% increase). Brazil is one of the countries with the highest cesareans rates, which
consisted of 56.3% of all deliveries in 2019 [29]. Since most guidelines support that maternal COVID19 infection should not influence the type of delivery [30], it should be safe to assume that the pandemic
did not significantly impact this group of procedures.
COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on patients, the economy and healthcare systems.
There is hope that cases will begin to decline soon and, as the COVID-19 vaccine is distributed,
hospitals must develop protocols to resume elective surgeries safely. This will be the next challenge for
the surgical community. Moving forward requires not only creativity but also structural changes to
patient workflows [31-33].
Regarding the long-term effects on surgical practice, this pandemic should raise awareness
regarding protective measures to both surgical staff and patients, and the protocols' changes made to
reduce the risk of contamination during surgical procedures should be added to operating theaters
routines.
This study has limitations: the data refer only to the Brazilian public health system because data
from the private health system are not available, which might lead to an overestimation of the decrease
rates. As secondary data, the veracity of the information provided depends on proper registration.
Although regression analyses that could help explain the differences in the number of surgeries
between subgroups and regions were not performed, some justifications for the temporal trends of
reduction in surgical procedures are speculated, such as the correlation with decrees and laws of state
and municipal governments that imposed the postponement of elective surgeries.

5. Conclusion

COVID-19 pandemic has promoted changes in the surgical practice in Brazil. The need for
minimizing the overload in healthcare facilities has demanded reductions in healthcare activities and
avoidance of non-urgent procedures, as seen by the notable decline in elective surgeries. Lower
numbers of procedures were seen in April, July and December of 2020, periods of an increasing number
of cases in the country.
