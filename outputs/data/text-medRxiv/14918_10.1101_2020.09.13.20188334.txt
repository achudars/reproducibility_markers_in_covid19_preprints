Abstract

25

Background: We assessed the performance, stability, and user acceptability of swab-

26

independent self-collected saliva and saline mouth rinse/gargle sample types for the

27

molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in adults and school-aged children. Methods:

28

Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with

29

suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at

30

least one self-collected sample type. A portion of participants were also asked about sample

31

acceptability. Samples underwent molecular testing using multiple assays. Saline mouth

32

rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess

33

nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were

34

included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary

35

sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40)

36

while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and

37

saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage.

38

Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the

39

lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples

40

demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance

41

when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs. This sample type is a promising

42

swab-independent option, particularly for outpatient self-collection in adults and school aged

43

children.

Background

50

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a

51

global pandemic that has shown the potential to overwhelm the capacity of local and national

52

health care systems (1). Rapid scale-up of molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 has occurred

53

on an unprecedented scale and has presented numerous challenges including deployment of

54

assays with variable performance, lack of availability of high throughput testing platforms,

55

and bottle-necks in supply chain procurement of pre-analytical materials and testing reagents

56

(2). One of the key weaknesses in the diagnostic cycle has been the challenge of sample

57

acquisition. While nasopharyngeal flocked swab (NPFS) collection has been the gold-

58

standard for diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infections using NAT methods (3), it is

59

difficult to collect due to the associated discomfort, and is resource intensive requiring health

60

care workers (HCW) for collection and procurement of these collection devices has proved to

61

be a challenge in many jurisdictions. This quality initiative was carried out in order to meet

62

anticipated increases in outpatient testing demands the expected challenges associated with

63

global NPFS supply chain, the difficult nature of NPFS sample collection and complex

64

handling of highly viscose saliva samples in the laboratory. We compared the analytical

65

performance, sample stability and user acceptability of saline gargle and saliva samples

66

against healthcare provider collected NPFS in out-patients with COVID-19 infections.

67
68

Methods

Individuals from the Vancouver Greater Metropolitan Area of British Columbia were

70

approached for participation in this quality-improvement initiative if they had SARS-CoV-2

71

detected in any clinical sample collected at an outpatient testing centre or if they were

identified as a symptomatic household contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case. After August

73

28th, 2020 symptomatic children 4 to 12 years of age presenting to the BC Children’s and

74

Women’s Hospital Campus COVID-19 Collection Centre were also asked to provide a saline

75

mouth rinse/gargle sample in addition to an NPFS. Verbal consent was obtained from all

76

participants and for those who provided both saliva and saline mouth rinse/gargle samples the

77

order of sample collection was alternated sequentially (i.e. saliva first vs mouth rinse/gargle

78

sample first). Demographic and clinical information was collected including age, whether

79

they were a health care worker (HCW), if they had been previously admitted to hospital, the

80

date of onset of their symptoms, and the date of initial molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 (if

81

applicable). Sample collection occurred either at the participant’s residence or at the BC

82

Children’s and Women’s Hospital Campus COVID-19 Collection Centre, and instruction

83

sheets (Supplement 1) with supporting verbal instructions were provided. Participants were

84

asked to not eat, drink, smoke, brush their teeth or chew gum 1 hour prior to collection.

85

Self-collection procedures

86

Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (flexible flocked swabs with 3 mL universal viral transport

87

system media, Beckon Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) were collected via the left naris unless

88

preference was stated for the right naris. NPFS were inserted the distance from the naris to

89

the external ear canal and then rotated 5 times and left in place for 5 – 10 seconds prior to

90

being removed as per Center for Disease Control instructions for collection (4). Mouth

91

rinse/gargle specimens were self-collected by instructing users to open 5 ml vials of sterile

92

0.9% saline (Addipak®, Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) and squeeze

93

the contents into their or their child’s open mouth. They were then asked to swish the

94

contents for 5 seconds followed by tilting their heads back and gargling for 5 seconds. This

95

swish/gargle cycle was repeated 2 more times and then the saline was expelled into a wide

96

mouthed sterile empty polypropylene container (Leakbuster™ 90 ml container, Starplex

97

Scientific, Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada). For saliva sample collection, participants were asked

98

to pool and spit saliva repeatedly into a wide mouthed sterile empty polypropylene container

99

(Leakbuster™ 90 ml container, Starplex Scientific, Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada) until at least

100

5 – 10 ml were collected if possible. Samples were immediately brought to the laboratory and

101

were processed within 12 hours of collection. All samples were vortexed for at least 10

102

seconds prior to aliquoting for testing.

103

Laboratory testing

104

All samples were extracted with the QiaSymphony automated extractor using the DSP

105

virus/pathogen minikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and subsequently tested with a

106

laboratory developed test (LDT) within 24 hours of collection on the Applied Biosystems

107

7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mouth rinse/gargle

108

and saliva samples were also stored in the laboratory at room temperature (21oC) and

109

extracted and tested again on day 1 and day 2 after collection. The previously validated LDT

110

is a triplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay that targets both

111

the pan-sarbecovirus E gene as well as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene

112

and also targets the human RNase P gene as a sample positive control (5). A portion of the

113

NPFS and mouth rinse gargle specimens were also tested using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress

114

SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) as per manufacturer

115

instructions.

116

User acceptability of sampling

117

Participants who had all three samples collected were asked about the acceptability of each

118

self-collected sample type they had obtained as well as about the HCW-collected NPFS using

119

a 5 point Likert scale with 1 being “least acceptable” and 5 being “most acceptable”.

This project was reviewed by the BC Children’s and Women’s Research Ethics Board and

121

deemed a quality improvement/quality assurance (QI/QA) activity based on completion of

122

the Provincial Health Services Authority Project Sorting Tool.

123

Statistical analysis

124

For the purpose of the analysis of sensitivity for each sample type, individuals were

125

considered a positive case if they had at least one sample test positive for both targets (E gene

126

and RdRP gene) on the LDT. Samples were considered positive with a threshold cycle (Ct)

127

value of less than 40 on the LDT and as reported by the Xpert assay (presumptive positive

128

results were considered as positive). Using this reference standard for a SARS-CoV-2

129

positive participant the sensitivity results of mouth rinse/gargle sampling was compared to

130

NPFS and saliva sampling (LDT assay) using the test for comparing two independent

131

proportions (STATA command prtesti); the McNemar exact test was also used to determine

132

the comparability of mouth rinse/gargle sample testing as compared to NPFS or saliva sample

133

testing. The Ct values obtained with baseline testing using all sample types were compared

134

using repeated-measures ANOVA using Box’s conservative correction factor, with post hoc

135

significant pairwise differences determined using Tukey’s HSD; this methodology was also

136

used to compare acceptability ratings of all sample types. For assessment of stability of

137

SARS-CoV-2 RNA between gargle samples and saliva samples (transport media free

138

methods), individuals were only included if they had samples tested at each of those three

139

time points (time zero, day 1, and day 2). Statistical significance was set as p<0.05. All

140

testing was done using STATA v16.1 (College Station, TX).

A

total

of

50

participants

(34

known

positives

and

16

household

144

contacts/symptomatic children) provided validation samples between May 8th and September

145

11th, 2020. Of these, 40 participants were found to be positive according to the reference

146

definition at the time of study sample collection. There were 28 (56%) participants that were

147

female, with a median age of 25.1 years (25-75 percentile 13.6-35.9 years) and 10 were < 18

148

years of age. Data on symptoms was available for 40 participants; of these, 17 (42%) had

149

fever and 25 (62%) had cough. Among participants found to be positive, the median time

150

from infection confirmation to re-testing was 3 days (25-75 percentile 2-5 days) and the

151

median time from symptoms to re-testing was 7 days (25-75 percentile 4-9 days).

152

The results of testing for each of the sample types for all positive participants are

153

shown in Table 1. Mouth rinse/gargle samples were significantly more likely to be positive

154

than saliva samples (difference of 18.7%, 95%CI 3.9-33.5%, p=0.01). When matched

155

samples were compared, mouth rinse/gargle sample testing results differed statistically from

156

saliva samples (26 positive by both, 6 rinse/gargle positive but saliva negative, and 1 negative

157

by both, McNemar p=0.03) but mouth rinse/gargle sample and saliva testing results were

158

statistically similar to HCW-collected NPFS testing results. Positivity proportions for NPFS,

159

mouth rinse/gargle and saliva sample types based on time from COVID-19 diagnosis are

160

shown in Figure 1.

161

Participant rated acceptability performance of sample types is shown in Table 2. There were

162

clear differences between the acceptability of the sample types; the mouth rinse/gargle

163

sample had the highest mean acceptability (4.95) and was significantly more acceptable than

164

HCW-collected NPFS (mean acceptability 3.17) or saliva sampling (mean acceptability

165

4.44).

166

Mean Ct values at baseline did not differ significantly between sample types; these data are

167

shown in Figure 2. Mean Ct data at day zero, day 1, and day 2 for mouth rinse/gargle and

168

saliva samples are shown in Figure 3. There was no significant difference in baseline Ct

169

values across sample types, and for saliva and mouth rinse/gargle samples there was no

170

significant loss of RNA recovery over all time points. Also amongst positive participants with

171

mouth rinse/gargle (n = 30) and saliva (n = 28) samples that were tested on all three days

172

there were a similar number of negative results (for both targets) on each day (saliva day 0=

173

6, day 1 = 4 and day 2 = 3; mouth rinse/gargle day 0 = 1, day 1 = 5, and day 2 = 2).

174
175

Discussion:

176

Laboratory diagnostics are critical for any attempt to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Our

177

study demonstrates that self-collected mouth rinse/gargle samples are non-inferior to HCW-

178

collected NPFS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and, at the same time, are significantly

179

more acceptable to patients. Mouth rinse/gargle specimens, in particular, demonstrated the

180

highest sensitivity and were preferred by those undergoing sampling. These data should be

181

considered by all those planning laboratory testing strategies and algorithms; self-collected

182

mouth rinse/gargle samples may obviate the need for the deployment of significant numbers

183

of HCWs trained in sample collection and the consumption of large amounts of personal

184

protective equipment. It should be emphasized that testing volumes will very likely be even

185

higher in late 2020 as many children and adolescents return to school and respiratory

186

symptoms become more common with the increasing prevalence of many other respiratory

187

viruses.

188

Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples (also known as mouth throat washes) have previously

189

been evaluated for influenza and other respiratory virus detection (6, 7), showing promising

190

performance when compared to throat swab and other sample types. Interestingly, although

191

there have been numerous evaluations of multiple self-collected sample types including mid-

192

turbinate swabs, throat swabs, and saliva samples, there have been very few reports to date

193

describing mouth rinse/gargle samples for COVID-19 diagnosis (8, 9). In one study in

194

Germany (10), 5 individuals were evaluated who had both saline gargle samples and throat

195

swab samples and all 5 gargle samples were positive whereas only 4 had a positive throat

196

swab sample. The technique we used for acquisition of saline mouth rinse/gargle samples

197

(three cycles for mouth rinse followed by gargle) may allow for improved recovery of viral

198

RNA given that it would effectively sample the entire oropharynx. Collecting mouth

199

rinse/gargle samples could also potentially result in a significant amount of savings due to the

200

lack of need for personal protective equipment or trained HCWs for sample acquisition. Its

201

utility might be even higher in low and middle income country settings or remote regions

202

where access to testing clinics would be another barrier to sample acquisition. The stability of

203

RNA recovery in this sample type was preserved for at least two days at room temperature,

204

making later drop-off delivery of samples a feasible option.

205

In our study, saliva samples were both significantly less sensitive and less acceptable than

206

mouth rinse/gargle samples. Several recent reports have found favourable detection rates for

207

saliva samples, however most of these have been in inpatient populations (11) where viral

208

load levels tend to be higher and/or utilized additional manual saliva processing steps (12)

209

that are less amenable to high throughput processing. In our evaluation processing of saliva

210

samples was intermittently observed to be impeded by variable sample viscosity; additional

211

manual processing of two saliva samples was required due to excessive amounts of mucus

212

present. For these reasons, amongst the swab- and transport media free options, the mouth

213

rinse/gargle samples appeared more attractive.

214

Our study design had several strengths. In addition to having a number of participants across

215

the pediatric and adult age ranges, we also enrolled solely individuals presenting with

216

outpatient illness, where the largest burden of testing is performed. This is particularly the

217

case for testing surges that are expected with return to school for children in the fall. Our

218

evaluation also includes the assessment of performance across multiple extraction and PCR

219

platforms, including a Health Canada and FDA authorized commercial assay. A main

220

weakness of the study is that a number of the patients enrolled did not have samples collected

221

until > 5 days into their illness and therefore we had a number of samples with lower amounts

222

of viral RNA detected. Also as mentioned, the population sampled only included relatively

223

well outpatients and it is unclear if similar performance would be found in those with more

224

severe inpatient disease.

225

Given the very high user acceptability rating, lack of need for swabs and/or transport media,

226

and excellent diagnostic yield, saline mouth rinse/gargle samples appear to be a preferred

227

sample type for testing of outpatients with suspected COVID-19.
