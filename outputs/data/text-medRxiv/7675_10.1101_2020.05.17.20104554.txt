The exact risk of dying from COVID-19 has remained elusive and a topic of debate. In this
study, the observed case fatality rates of 46 different countries are hypothesized to be dependent on
their testing rates. An analytical test to this hypothesis suggests that the case fatality rate of COVID19 could be consistent to a certain degree across all countries and states. The current global fatality
rate is estimated to be around 1% and expected to converge between 1-3% when the pandemic ends.
This model can be helpful to estimate the true infection rate for individual countries.

This study uses a mathematical modeling approach to estimate the true outbreak size and clinical severity of COVID-19. It
is a preliminary report that has not been certified yet by peer review. It should not be relied on to guide clinical practice
or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information.

The exact risk of dying from COVID-19 has remained elusive and a topic of debate. In this study, the observed
case fatality rates of 46 different countries are hypothesized to be dependent on their testing rates. An analytical test to
this hypothesis suggests that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 could be consistent to a certain degree across all countries
and states. The current global fatality rate is estimated to be around 1% and expected to converge between 1-3% when the
pandemic ends. This model can be helpful to estimate the true infection rate for individual countries.

The case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is defined as the ratio
of reported deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection to the number
of infected patients. The case fatality of COVID-19 and its
variation across different countries remains debatable (1-4).
In many countries, the case fatality even varies widely across
different states (5). The observed inconsistency of CFR has
been associated with age(3), co-morbidity(6), the efficiency of
the healthcare system(7), three different viral strains(8),
regional weather(9), and even vaccination schedule(10).
However, none of these parameters are probably sufficient to
explain the variation with mathematical precision.
To accurately calculate the fatality rate, it is necessary to
correctly estimate the number of people infected by the virus,
i.e., the denominator of the CFR ratio. (2). But, a salient
feature of COVID-19 disease is its mild and asymptomatic
nature in a large number of infected patients, who can carry
and spread the infection to other healthy susceptible
individuals. Data from recent studies suggest 25%-70%
carriers of SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic or show very
limited symptoms (11, 12). Therefore, the efficiency of COVID19 detection or testing is critical. Accurate detection not only
helps isolate the infected patients, but it also allows accurate
documentation of the infection and fatality rate. However, the
testing infrastructure and policies also widely vary across
nations, once again giving rise to an inconsistency in the
fatality rate. This letter is intended to illustrate an intriguing
relationship between the case fatality and testing rate which
is gradually emerging from the COVID-19 dataset worldwide.
A mathematical correlation function was derived using a
simple model of infection transmission.
As only a very small percent of infected people develop severe
symptoms, the large number of mild and asymptomatic
patients can be missed easily. To overcome this challenge, the
detection strategies (Covid-19 testing) follow an efficient
algorithm. The probability of infection transmission from one
particular individual gradually decreased from the closecontacts (persons who are close, or came close to the infected
individual) to the far-contacts (persons who were physically
distant from the infected individual). The probability of the
spread of the infection approaches to zero for someone who is
located at a large distance from the infected individual.
Therefore the detection of COVID-19 infection is largely

performed by a contact tracing method, mostly to maximize
the efficiency of detection. In this method, when a patient
(symptomatic or asymptomatic) is tested positive, all the
individuals who came in close contact with that person in the
last 10-14 days are tested with the highest priority. Thus, the
detection algorithm is optimized by adapting the same
pattern of the infection-transmission (see supplementary note
Q1).
It is fundamentally important to accurately model the true
detection efficiency in a population to know the true outbreak
size and subsequently develop more efficient testing
strategies. The chance of the contracting infection from one
infected person can be mathematically modeled with a
probability distribution function, which gradually decreases
from the close-contacts to the far-contacts. As the spread of
infection occurs continuously and independently at a constant
average rate, the probability distribution is assumed to be
exponentially decaying from close-contacts to far-contacts
according to the following equation (Figure 1):
𝑃(𝑛) = 𝑒 −𝜆𝑛

(1);

where 𝑃(𝑛) is the probability of contracting the infection for
𝑛𝑡ℎ contact person and 𝜆 is a constant representing the rate of
decay. The physical distance of a contact person from the
infected individual increases equivalently with the numerical
value of 𝑛. The unit cell (or the building block) of this model
includes only a single infected person at the center and the
people who can contract the infection from that person
directly. In reality, the same unit cell repeats itself for
secondary, tertiary, and subsequent infections. Thus, like a
growing crystal in a crystallization process, the infection keeps
spreading within a population by repeating the unit-cell of
infection following the same probability distribution function
(equation 1).
The total number of infection (𝐼0 ) within a unit-cell can be
estimated as (total area under the curve in figure 1a):
∞

𝐼0 = ∫0 𝑃(𝑛)𝑑𝑛

(2).

However, in an actual scenario, only a defined number of
individuals can be detected by testing. Thus, the number of

detected (𝐼) infection within a unit-cell can be estimated as
(shaded area under the curve in figure 1a):
𝑛

𝐼 = ∫0 𝑃(𝑛)𝑑𝑛

(3);

where 𝑛 is the number of individuals tested per detected case
through contact tracing, a number which widely varies across
countries. The value 𝐼 is equal to the area under the curve as
illustrated in figure 1. The mathematical expression of 𝐼 can be
derived as a function of 𝑛 by solving equations 1-3. Therefore,
the detection efficiency (Ф) can be estimated as the ratio of
the detected number to the actual number of infection within
the unit cell:
Ф=

𝐼

If 𝐷 is the number of deaths from the infection within the unitcell, then the actual CFR (δ0 ) and observed CFR (δ) can be
defined as:

respectively.

(6)

Solving equation 1-6, the following relation can be established
between the observed case fatality (dependent variable) and
the number of testing performed per detected case
(independent variable):

(4).

It is important to note that this ratio is dimensionless and
independent of the total number of population in a region. In
other words, this relationship is not limited to the unit-cell
but applies to the whole population. Therefore the detection
rate of COVID-19 within a population can be modeled using
the relation given in equation 4. The simulated curve in figure
1b illustrates that at a given time in a region, the % detection
of infected individuals increases when the testing rate is
increased (see supplementary note Q2), but eventually
saturates when most of the infected people are already
detected within that population (Ф ≃ 1). The numerical value
of exponential decay constant (𝜆 = .03) was derived from
fitting a dataset, which will be discussed later.

above. Conceptually, countries, where a large fraction of the
screened people have been found to be contracted with the
disease (SARS-CoV-2 positive), may have insufficient data to
accurately calculate their fatality rate. The observed fatality
rates in such countries could be overestimations and may fall
within a broad range as well. In contrast, countries that have
found most of the screened suspects to be negative for the
disease (SARS-CoV-2 negative) have higher odds of
converging into the accurate estimation of the fatality rate.
The fitted value of δ0 suggest that the true case fatality of
COVID-19 mathematically converges to 0.8% (δ0 = 0.8 ± 0.6)
with relatively small uncertainty (Figure 2b). This numerical
value is very similar to the fatality rate among the individuals
in the Diamond Princess cruise ship (0.99%), a unique case
study that might have provided us a reliable estimation of the
CFR of COVID-19 (2).

approximation (Taylor expansion).
Similar to detection efficiency, the equation 7-9 also holds for
the whole population outside the unit-cell. To test these
correlations within the existing datasets of COVID-19
pandemic, it is hypothesized that the actual or true fatality
rate of COVID-19 is consistent (δ0 is a constant) worldwide.
The values of δ(n) (total deaths/total cases) and n (total
tests/total cases) were calculated for 46 different countries
(Table S1, data collected from worldometers.info). The δ(n) vs
𝑛 plot was fitted using equation 7 to determine the value of δ0 .
The fitting and the relative location of some countries are
illustrated in Figure 2. The residual analysis is shown in the
supplementary information (Figure S1). The goodness of fit
can be further improved by excluding a few countries like
Brazil and Italy who appear to be the outliers in the plot. Yet,
the hypothesis can be tested keeping the uncertainties in
mind.

It must be mentioned here that the presence of outliers in
equation 7 is plausible with a low testing ratio (𝑛), as the cause
of death may depend on a large number of parameters as
mentioned before. Hence, the fatality rate may not be exactly
the same for each and every country. For instance, the
observed fatality rate of Italy would be expected around 5%
from equation 7, but it is >12% in practice due to several other
factors. In contrast, the observed fatality is lower than
expected in Brazil. Although these variations are expected
from the uncertainty equations, the accurate values for
individual countries cannot be estimated using this model.

According to equation 10, the uncertainty 𝛥δ linearly increases
with the value of 𝛥𝑛, and decays exponentially as a function of
𝑛. The uncertainty regions are illustrated in Figure 2b for three
different values of 𝛥𝑛. The uncertainty analysis provides
substantial supporting evidence to the hypothesis stated

An important question, which should arise in this context is
whether the CFR reflects the true severity of the disease. As
there is a time-lag between recovery and death, the CRF may
keep changing throughout the epidemic in each country and
saturate to a certain value at the end. Additional
considerations might be needed to account for the time delay
between disease onset and death (or recovery) from COVID19 infection for the assessment of the actual clinical severity of
the disease. For that, one can also look at the fatality rate in
closed cases (CCFR), which takes the relative speed between
death and recovery into considerations. At a given time point
CCFR is generally found to be higher than CRF due to the long
time delay between infection and recovery (figure 3a,
supplementary information figure S2). A fitting of CCFR with
a similar method results in a global fatality rate of around 3%
(δ0 = 2.7 ± 0.3). The CCFR is expected to gradually decrease
and converge to the same value of CFR at the end of the
pandemic. Thus, at any time point, both of these timesensitive indices may inaccurately represent the clinical
severity. Yet, they provide a reliable window for the true
fatality range which gradually diminishes with the duration of
the pandemic (figure 3b). This range of uncertainty would
gradually reduce with time as the pandemic progresses.

One corollary which immediately manifests from this
hypothesis is a possible route of estimation of the actual size
of the outbreak. If it is assumed that most of the undetected
patients recover from a mild or asymptomatic infection, then
the current observed rate of recovery would also be an
underestimation. According to the model discussed above, the
outbreak size can be approximately estimated as a function of
𝑛 using equation 1-4 (Figure 1b) and the fitted value of 𝜆
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑑
(Figure 4a). Assuming 𝑛 =
, and 𝜆 = 0.03,
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑
equation 4 suggests that most of the countries may have
already missed a significant portion of the infected population
who might have recovered from a milder disease (Figure 4b).
For instance, France, Brazil, Iran, and Belgium who have
reported one of the highest rates (~30-50%, n≃2-3) of positive
cases during Covid-19 detection, might have missed up to 7590% of the true infected population till May 3, 2020. In
contrast, Vietnam, UAE, Hong Kong, South Korea, or New
Zealand who have reported the least rate of positive cases
(~0.2-2%, n≃50-500) might have missed only 1-10% till May 3,
2020, according to this model. However, to estimate the
number of recovered individuals from mild infection, it might
need an in-depth formulation (Figure 4a) of the rate
equations, which is outside the scope of this letter.

according to the model.

So, in conclusion, the analytical approach presented in this
letter shows that the widely variable observed fatality rate is a
function of the testing rate or the average tests performed per
case (see supplementary note Q3). However, the true case
fatality rate has a fixed value between 1-3% in most of the
countries. The methodology described here could be useful to
estimate the true size of the infected population, which

otherwise largely remains unknown. The accuracy of this
simple mathematical approach can be improved further with
additional parameters in future studies. This study attempts
to reliably distill the data from various countries into a
coherent mathematical formulation to estimate the global risk
of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.
