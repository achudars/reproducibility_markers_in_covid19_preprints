Abstract
Advances in medical technology and IT infrastructure have led to increased availability of continuous
patient data that allows investigation of the longitudinal progression of novel and known diseases in
unprecedented detail. However, to accurately describe any underlying pathophysiology with
longitudinal data, the individual patient trajectories have to be synchronized based on temporal
markers. In this study, we use longitudinal data from 28 critically ill ICU COVID-19 patients to
compare the commonly used alignment markers “onset of symptoms”, “hospital admission” and “ICU
admission” with a novel objective method based on the peak value of inflammatory marker C-reactive
protein (CRP). By applying our CRP-based method to align the progression of neutrophils and
lymphocytes, we were able to define a pathophysiological window that allowed further risk
stratification in our COVID-19 patient cohort. Our data highlights that proper synchronization of patient
data is crucial to differentiate severity subgroups and to allow reliable interpatient comparisons.
Introduction
The rapid spread of corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) imposes a heavy burden on public health
systems around the world. A substantial number of patients show a severe disease progression
possibly caused by endotheliitis, gas diffusion impairment and organ ischemia [1, 2]. Current research
efforts focus on the identification of predictive indicators that allow closer supervision and targeted
intervention in high-risk patients. As a hyper-activated immune response might act as a driving factor
for severe COVID-19 progression [1], ratios between neutrophils and lymphocytes (NLR) [3],
lymphocyte counts alone [4] and elevation of specific cytokines among other laboratory values [3, 5-7]
have been proposed as markers for initial patient risk assessment and stratification. Currently, most
studies solely compare measurements taken at hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) admission,
neglecting the enormous potential of continuous longitudinal data obtained throughout hospitalization.
This is especially detrimental for the most severe patients, as this high mortality risk group could
benefit the most from a more detailed separation into different disease progression subgroups.
However, the pooling of longitudinal data requires a temporal marker to align individual patient
trajectories. In this pilot study, we compare different alignment methods and show that C-reactive
protein (CRP) can be used to synchronize the individual patient trajectories with the underlying
pathophysiology.
Results
To date, only few studies show longitudinal data of COVID-19 patients, and single time point patient
comparisons are often made based on clinical parameters such as onset of symptoms, hospital or
ICU admission [3-7]. Alignment based on these values could potentially introduce unnecessary
interpatient variation due to human bias and circumstantial parameters such as hospital capacity,
resource availability or accessibility, and could eventually result in a clouding of the true underlying
disease progression. Comparison of individual patient trajectories in our cohort of 28 critically ill
COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of the University Hospital Zurich (Suppl. Table 1) already
revealed considerable inter-patient variability (Fig. 1 a): Out of the 28 patients, 8 were directly

transferred to the ICU upon hospital admission and 5 additional patients were transferred to the ICU
only one day after hospital admission. Based on this data alone, it is evident that interpatient
comparison at hospital or ICU admission was biased in our ICU COVID-19 patient cohort. Likewise,
onset of symptoms showed a high variation (7.65 ± 8.49 days) and was occasionally missing. Group
comparisons based on these clinical markers might result in the description of false differences, for
example by comparing patients in late disease stages with patients in early disease stages, or
occlusion of actual differences due to temporal misalignment (Fig. 1 b). These problems are
encountered by most medical centers and researchers alike and highlight the necessity for an
objective synchronization marker that aligns individual patient trajectories to the underlying
pathophysiology.
An ideal disease timer should provide both an early indication of disease progression and should be
measured routinely in most hospital settings. Previous patient cohort studies have correlated the
serum levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), myoglobin and cardiac troponin at
hospital admission with COVID-19 severity [6]. However, these values were not measured on a daily
basis around ICU admission both in our cohort (38.2%, 59.7%, 62.7% respectively) and in the
international RISC-19-ICU registry cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients (14.6%, 9.6%, 30.0% in
Switzerland and 15.3%, 6.7%, 28.2% internationally), thereby making them poor candidates for
longitudinal alignment (Fig. 1 c). Instead, the acute phase inflammatory marker CRP was measured
routinely around ICU admission both in our cohort (98.2%) and in the RISC-19-ICU registry cohort
(86.9% in Switzerland, 74.8% internationally). CRP is under direct transcriptional control of IL-6, but
shows a wider peak, making it more likely to be recorded by daily measurements and when the
patient is hospitalized [8]. In contrast to other frequently measured laboratory values such as
hematological cell counts or creatinine, we found that most patients had a distinct CRP maximum
around ICU admission in our cohort, indicating a correlation with COVID-19 severity and progression
(Fig. 1 d). Some patients showed further CRP maxima during their ICU stay, probably resulting from
coinfections or secondary damage [8]. We hypothesize that the first local CRP maximum (CRPmax) is
primarily related to COVID-19 progression and can therefore be used to synchronize individual patient
trajectories to the underlying pathophysiology. In our patient cohort, alignment based on CRPmax
decreased both interpatient variability in the longitudinal CRP curve (Fig. 1 d) and the variability of
other laboratory values such as total leukocyte and relative neutrophil and lymphocyte counts to a
similar extent than the clinically based ICU admission alignment (Suppl. Fig. 1).
Our primary goal to accurately align longitudinal patient data was to further differentiate between the
most severe ICU COVID-19 patients. To test whether CRPmax-based synchronization improves patient
stratification in our ICU patient cohort, we retrospectively defined three severity subgroups: (1)
deceased ICU patients (n=6), (2) discharged ICU patients that had been mechanically ventilated
(n=13) and (3) discharged ICU patients that had been spontaneously breathing while in the ICU (n=9).
CRP peak values were more than threefold higher in the mechanically ventilated patient subgroups
(mean±SD, 346±147 mg/L) as compared to the spontaneously breathing subgroup (99±74 mg/L), but
did not differ from the deceased subgroup (338±106 mg/L) (Fig 1 e). This lack of distinction is
reflected in all alignment methods. In accordance to current literature, we further assessed the
longitudinal progression of relative neutrophils and lymphocyte counts (Suppl. Fig. 2) and the ratio
thereof (NLR, Fig. 1 e) in the three severity subgroups [3, 4]. While both admission-based and
CRPmax-based alignment improved subgroup separation, only CRPmax-based synchronization
revealed a distinct NLR turning point, occurring simultaneously with CRPmax, thereby providing a
window for maximal subgroup distinction. A linear mixed effect model [9] employing subgroup and
time as fixed effects and per-patient random slopes as random effects confirmed a difference
between the subgroups and the measured time points in a window of ±4 days around CRPmax
(p<0.01, Suppl. Table 1), whereas the time wise difference was not detected in the data shifted by
ICU admission (Suppl. Table 2). Similarly, when comparing the subgroups in single time points of
each alignment method, only the CRPmax-based synchronization resulted in a significant difference
between the two most severe patient subgroups (Fig. 1 f). These findings strengthen our CRPmaxbased synchronization as a potential tool for patient alignment and subgroup stratification.

In a last step, we explored whether different patient synchronization methods might have an impact
on future outcome prediction using machine learning techniques (Suppl. Fig. 3). We generated two
feature vectors for each patient containing the mean values of CRP, relative neutrophils and
lymphocytes of a time window anchored on either ICU admission or on CRPmax (Suppl. Fig. 3 upper
panel). Using a stratified 5-fold cross validation logistic regression model, we found that the CRPmax
anchoring increased the overall prediction accuracy by 9.6% and F1-macro score by 51.8% (accuracy
0.68 ± 0.22, F-score 0.668 ± 0.23) as compared to the ICU admission anchoring (accuracy 0.62 ±
0.10, F-score 0.44 ± 0.13) (Suppl. Fig. 3 b-c, window 1). Similarly, the corresponding confusion
matrices indicated a higher accuracy in distinguishing between the most severe subgroups of
mechanically ventilated and deceased ICU patients (Suppl. Fig. 3 d-e). Collectively, this data
suggests that pathophysiological synchronization of longitudinal patient data has the potential to
improve mortality-risk stratification and subgroup distinction of severe ICU patients both in a clinical
setting and for research purposes.
Discussion
In this pilot study containing 28 critically ill COVID-19 patients, we demonstrated that longitudinal data
synchronization based on the inflammatory marker CRP reduces interpatient variability at least to an
equal extend as the ICU admission based alignment. Both “onset of symptoms” and “hospital
admission” were poor temporal markers, leading to increased variability, occlusion of subgroup
differences and, in case of “onset of symptoms”, to patient exclusions due to unclear data. The
interpretation and translation of noteworthy symptoms from patients to clinicians make “onset of
symptoms” a highly subjective value for patient synchronization, which is reflected in our data and
early reports of exaggerated incubation periods until onset of disease [5, 10]. While ICU admission is
a consistent clinical marker in our monocentric study, this might not be the case when comparing
patients from different hospitals with less stringent or deviating ICU admission criteria, resources or
ICU capacity. Furthermore, COVID-19 associated symptoms might not be the primary reason for ICU
admission in some patients and, obviously, this temporal marker cannot be applied to non-ICU
patients. In contrast, our findings suggest that CRP can serve as an objective synchronization marker
that allows alignment of disease trajectories independent of hospital specific policies, which is of
special value for multicenter studies.
In line with previous studies, our subgroup analysis of both CRPmax and ICU aligned data reproduced
the COVID-19 severity markers: neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia and the ratio thereof [3-7]. However,
only CRPmax-based longitudinal alignment improved distinction between the most severe subgroups of
mechanically ventilated patients and deceased patients. Although this pilot study relies on a small
cohort, our data suggests a central role for CRP in the timing of COVID-19 immunopathology by
marking the turning point of longitudinal NLR dynamic and thereby providing a window for maximal
subgroup distinction. Interestingly, CRP itself has immune-modulating functions such as complement
activation, regulation of apoptosis and cellular processes of both neutrophils and monocyte-derived
cells [8]. Although an elevation of CRP is generally associated with bacterial rather than viral
infections [8, 11, 12], elevated CRP levels have been observed in COVID-19 patients as well as in
severe progression of other respiratory viral diseases such as influenza [3, 4, 6, 13, 14]. It is tempting
to speculate that elevation of CRP in severe respiratory viral infections marks a shift from a more
localized inflammation of the lungs to a multi-organ systemic immune response.
Digitalization of modern medicine has led to increased availability of continuous patient data that
should be used to describe and define longitudinal disease progression and pathophysiology of novel
and known diseases alike. Our data highlights that proper synchronization of longitudinal patient
trajectories to the underlying pathophysiology is crucial to differentiate severity subgroups and allow
reliable interpatient comparisons.

regularization value in the interval of [10ିସ – 10ସ], optimizer (LBFGS [16], SAGA [17]) and with or without class
weighting. The best models as determined by F1-macro score on the 4-fold cross validation were then tested on
