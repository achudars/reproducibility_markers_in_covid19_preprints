Highlights:
•

South Korea has experienced two spatially heterogenous waves of COVID-19.

Seoul and Gyeonggi Province experienced two waves of COVID-19 in March and June.

•

In the densely populated Seoul and nearby areas, reproduction numbers exceeded 3.0.

•

The easing of the social distancing measures resulted in the second wave.

Abstract
Objectives: In South Korea, 13,745 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported as of 19
July, 2020. To examine the spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we present regional
estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in the country.
Methods: Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from
publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate
the time-varying reproduction numbers of the COVID-19 in Korea and its doubling time, respectively.
Results: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have experienced the first peak of COVID19 in early March, followed by the second wave in early June, with Rt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling
time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu are yet to
experience a second wave of the disease, where the mean Rt reached 3.5-4.4 and doubling time ranging
from 2.8 to 4.6 days during the first wave.
Conclusions: Our findings support the effectiveness of control measures against COVID-19 in Korea.
However, the easing of the restrictions imposed by the government in May 2020 facilitated a second wave
in the greater Seoul area.

Introduction

Since the first COVID-19 cases reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, more
than 24.7 million cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), including more than 830,000 related deaths,
have been reported worldwide (WHO) as of August 30, 2020. In South Korea, the novel coronavirus was
first diagnosed in a 36-year-old Chinese woman who entered the country on 20 January 2020. South
Korea has since experienced two heterogenous waves of the disease with a total of 13,745 cases including
295 deaths as of 19 July 2020 (KCDC, 2020a).
During the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, public health authorities primarily
conducted strict contact tracing and isolation of confirmed cases as well as quarantined those suspected
with the novel coronavirus (Covid-19 National Emergency Response Center et al., 2020). As the number
of COVID-19 cases continued to increase, Korean public health authorities set the alert to the highest
level (Level 4) on 23 February and mandated the population to report any symptoms related to COVID-19
for further screening and testing. In addition, the country rapidly adopted a “test, trace, isolate, and treat”
strategy that has been deemed effective in stomping out localized outbreaks of the novel coronavirus
(KCDC, 2020a). However, the total number of confirmed cases in South Korea spiked from 31 cases on
18 February to 433 on 22 February. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(KCDC), this sudden jump was mainly attributed to a super-spreader (the 31st case) who had participated
in a religious gathering of attendees of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu (KCDC, 2020a). These
superspreading events occurred in the Daegu and Gyeongbuk provincial regions, leading to more than
5,210 secondary COVID-19 cases in Korea (KCDC, 2020a, Ryall, 2020). These events facilitated
sustained transmission chains, with 38% of the cases in the country associated with the church cluster in
Daegu (Shim et al., 2020b).
On 8 March, the KCDC announced that 79.4% of the total cases had epidemiological links, whereas
the remaining 20.6% cases were either sporadic cases or under investigation (KCDC, 2020a). Case
clusters started to accumulate from churches in the Seoul capital area, and on 17 March, 79 church

attendees developed COVID-19 after attending a service at the River of Grace Community Church.
Notwithstanding social distancing orders put forward by the government, some churches continued to
conduct services, which led to new clusters of infections. For instance, the Manmin Central Church in
Seoul was involved in one of the clusters, with 41 infections linked to a gathering in early March;
SaengMyeongSu Church in Gyeonggi Province was another church cluster linked to 50 cases (Park, 2020).
As SARS-CoV-2 infection spread rapidly outside Korea, the number of imported cases started to
increase, resulting in 476 imported (4.9%) cases out of 9,661 total cases as of 30 March. Consequently, as
of 1 April, the KCDC implemented self-quarantine measures for travellers from Europe and the U.S.A
(KCDC, 2020a). In addition, incoming travellers with symptoms but negative test results for coronavirus,
as well as asymptomatic short-term visitors were ordered to follow a 2-week quarantine in the government
facilities (KCDC, 2020a).
Such control measures undertaken by South Korea have been deemed successful in limiting the
spread of the outbreak, without locking down entire cities (Normile, 2020). Therefore, after a sustained
period of low incidence with fewer than 20 cases per day (16 April – 5 May), the government eased its
strict nationwide social distancing guidelines on 6 May, with a phased reopening of schools starting midMay, 2020. However, a new cluster linked to nightclubs in Itaewon emerged in central Seoul in early May,
resulting in a resurgence of cases, that led to a second wave of COVID-19 in the greater areas of Seoul. As
of 29 May, the number of cases that were linked to this cluster had reached 266 (KCDC, 2020a).
Accordingly, the Seoul city government ordered all clubs, bars, and other nightlife establishments in the
city to close indefinitely (KCDC, 2020a). Simultaneously, another cluster emerged from an e-commerce
warehouse in the Gyeonggi Province, resulting in 108 cases as of 30 May.
In the last week of May, ~40-80 daily new cases of COVID-19 were being reported (KCDC, 2020a).
Following this spike in the number of new COVID-19 infections in nearly 2 months, public health
authorities reimplemented strict lockdown measures in Seoul along with school closure, one more time
across the nation. In June, it was announced that the strict social distancing campaign would be
indefinitely extended as a preventive measure in Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province; however,

phased reopening of schools was initiated on May 20. It was reported by the KCDC that a holiday
weekend in early May triggered a new wave of infections focused in the greater Seoul area, the so-called
second wave of COVID-19 in South Korea (2020). In Seoul, the average number of new daily cases
reported from 4 June to 17 June was 43 (KCDC, 2020a). This was followed by sporadic clusters of
infections across the country in July, most of them associated with religious facilities and door-to-door
salespeople, especially in the densely populated Seoul region and adjacent areas. Therefore, since 10 July,
the government banned churches from organizing small gatherings other than regular worship services
(KCDC, 2020a). As of 23 September, 23,216 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in South Korea,
including 13.4% imported cases, 59.7% cases linked to local clusters, 14.5% unlinked local cases, and
12.4% cases under investigation (KCDC, 2020a).
To estimate the regional and temporal variability in the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South
Korea, including the second wave concentrated in the greater Seoul areas, we analysed the spatiotemporal
progression of the epidemic in the country from mid-February to mid-July 2020. Here our focus lies on
estimating and interpreting the doubling time and effective reproduction number Rt, a metric that
quantifies the time-dependent transmission potential of the disease, incorporating the effect of control
measures, susceptible depletion, and behavioural changes. This key epidemiological parameter, Rt,
represents the average number of secondary cases generated per case whenever conditions persist as they
were at time t. Epidemic doubling times describes the sequence of intervals at which the cumulative
incidence doubles (Lee et al., 2020, Muniz-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Therefore, an increase in the doubling
time implies a decline in disease transmission. In this report, we estimated the doubling time and the
effective reproduction number involving two epidemic waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea
by employing the time series of cases by date of symptoms onset for the four most affected Korean
regions: Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk Province, and Daegu. We also discuss the spatiotemporal
variability of the reproduction number in terms of the public health policies that were put in place by the
Korean government.

Methods
Data
We collected the daily series of confirmed local COVID-19 cases in South Korea from 20 January to
19 July, which were published by national and local public health authorities, including city or provincial
departments of public health in South Korea (KCDC, 2020b). We focused our analysis on the regions
with the highest caseloads including Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk Province, and Daegu (Figure
1).

Imputing the date of onset
For a more accurate estimation of epidemic growth rates, the epidemic curve should be analyzed
according to the date of symptom onset rather than the date of reporting because reporting delays can
fluctuate substantially over the course of an epidemic. Reporting delays distort the incidence pattern of
epidemics, misrepresenting the outbreak trajectory, thus possibly affecting the estimation of the
reproduction number (Tariq et al., 2019). A prior study suggested that obtaining knowledge about
reporting parameters, such as delay patterns and structure, improves the estimates of the reproduction
numbers (Azmon et al., 2014). However, for the COVID-19 data in Korea, the date of symptom-onset is
only available for 732 cases reported in Gyeonggi Province, which yielded a mean of 4.5 days and
standard deviation of 4.4 days for the distribution of delays from symptoms onset to reporting of cases.
Therefore, we utilized the empirical distribution of these 732 reporting delays from the onset of symptoms
to reporting to impute the missing dates of onset for the remaining cases (Shim et al., 2020a). Specifically,
we reconstructed 300 epidemic curves according to the date of symptom onset, from which we derived the
mean incidence curve of local case incidence (Shim et al., 2020a, Tariq et al., 2019). For the calculation
of Rt(t), the mean incidence curve estimated based on the date of symptom onset was used for the regions
of interest (i.e., Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk Province, and Daegu) (Figure 2). Using the
reconstructed mean incidence curve of local case incidence, we removed the first and last three data points

to adjust for the reporting delays in our real-time analysis. We assumed that the first wave ends when the
mean incidence becomes less than 0.2 individuals per day. Similarly, we assumed that the second wave
starts when the mean incidence of local cases becomes greater than 0.5 individuals per day. Slight
variations to these thresholds did not affect our results.

Calculation of the doubling time
We analyzed the number of times COVID-19 cumulative incidence doubled and the evolution of the
doubling times in the four most affected areas in Korea (i.e., Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk
Province, and Daegu) from from 20 January to 19 July. Using regional-level daily cumulative incidence
data, we calculated the times at which cumulative incidence doubles, denoted by ௗ೔ . Specifically, we
assume that

where ௗబ

 0,  ௗబ = ଴

(

 0, 1, 2, 3, … , ௗ ),

and  ௗ೔  denotes the cumulative number of cases at

time ௗ೔ (Muniz-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Here, ௗ is defined as the total number of times cumulative
incidence doubles. Specifically, the sequence of doubling times are described as ௝

where   1, 2, 3, … , ௗ . In addition, we used parametric bootstrapping with a Poisson error structure
around the harmonic mean of doubling times to obtain the 95% confidence interval (Chowell et al., 2006a,
Chowell et al., 2006b).
Calculation of Rt
We assume that Rt(t) can be estimated by the ratio of the number of new infections generated at time
step t (It) to the total infectiousness of infected individuals at time t, given by ∑௧௦ୀଵ ௧ି௦ ௦ (Chong et al.,
2018, Fraser, 2007a). Here, ws denotes the infectivity profile of the infected individual, which is
dependent on the time since infection (s) but independent of calendar time (t) (He et al., 2020, Wallinga

and Teunis, 2004). Specifically, ws is defined as a probability distribution describing the average
infectiousness profile after infection. Individual biological factors such as pathogen shedding or symptom
severity can affect the distribution ws. For example, an individual would be most infectious at time s when
ws is the largest. Thus ∑௧௦ୀଵ ௧ି௦ ௦ indicates the sum of infection incidence up to time step t − 1,
weighted by the infectivity function ws. Steady values of Rt above one indicate sustained disease
transmission, whereas values less than one indicate that the number of new cases is expected to follow a
declining trend.
The infectivity profile, ws, can be approximated by the distribution of the generation time; however,
times of infection are rarely observed, making it difficult to measure the distribution of the generation
time (Fraser, 2007b). Therefore, the timing of symptoms onset is often used to estimate the distribution of
the serial interval (SI) instead, which is defined as the time interval between symptom onset in two
successive cases in a chain of transmission (Cori et al., 2013). Specifically, the infectiousness of a patient
is a function of the time since infection and is proportional to ws if we set the timing of infection in the
primary case as the time zero of ws and assume that the generation interval equals the SI. The SI was
assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.8 days and a standard deviation of 2.3 days
(Nishiura et al., 2020). Analytical estimates of Rt were obtained within a Bayesian framework using
EpiEstim R package in R language version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
(Cori et al., 2013). Rt was estimated at 7-day intervals, and we reported the median and 95% credible
interval (CrI).

Results
City of Seoul
As of 19 July, Seoul has reported a total of 1,474 cases (10.7% of the total reported in South Korea),
including 323 imported cases and 10 deaths, yielding an incidence rate estimated at 151 cases per million.

In Seoul, the first peak based on the estimated dates of symptom onset occurred during the second week
of March (8–14 March), with 18 new cases reported each day as the number of new cases linked to a
Guro-gu call centre kept rising. Based on the estimated dates of symptom onset, the 7-day moving
average of daily cases reached 19 cases on 9 March (Figure 3) whereas the highest value of Rt was
estimated at, Rt ~2.9 (95% CrI: 1.6-4.7) on 19 February which continued to stay above one until 6 March
(Figure 3).
After its first peak in February, the number of daily new cases by date of symptoms onset in Seoul
gradually declined, dropping below five on 1 April and staying under five new cases per day for about a
month (Figure 3). However, in early May, despite a steady decline in imported cases, locally transmitted
infections surged throughout the Seoul metropolitan area with case clusters traced to clubs, churches, and
sports facilities. Therefore, Rt increased, reaching 3.0 (95% CrI: 1.6-5.0) on 4 May 2020. During the first
wave, the doubling time was estimated to be 7.5 (95% CI: 7.0, 8.2) days in Seoul (Table 1).
The number of cases continued to increase thereon, and in the first week of June, the average daily
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the capital surpassed the previous high point in the daily
number of confirmed cases in the middle of March. The major clusters in Seoul were linked to nightclubs
(139 cases), the Guro-gu call centre (99 cases), Manmin Central Church (41 cases), Richway (97 cases),
Yangcheon-gu table tennis club (41 cases), and Newly Planted Church in the Seoul Metropolitan Region
(37 cases) as of 18 June. On 14 June, the average Rt in the capital, which reflects the average number of
people infected by a patient, dropped below one (95% CrI: 0.8-1.2), implying that the spread of the virus
had slowed down substantially in the city (Figure 3). During the second wave, the doubling time in Seoul
decreased to 6.0 (95% CI: 5.4, 6.7) days, indicating faster transmission compared to that during the first
wave (Table 1). As of 15 July 2020, the Rt in Seoul was estimated at 0.9 (95% CrI: 0.7-1.2), straddling the
epidemic threshold of 1.0, and suggesting potential for further transmission of the virus.

Gyeonggi Province (literally meaning the “province surrounding Seoul”) is located in the western
central region of Korea and is the most populous province in South Korea with a population of 13.5
million people. In Gyeonggi Province, the daily number of new cases by date of symptoms onset during
the last weeks of February was 6.3 on average (Figure 4). Accordingly, the first peak of Rt occurred on 22
February, reaching 8.9 (95% CrI: 4.8-14.2), with an estimated doubling time of 4.6 (95% CI: 4.2, 5.5)
days (Table 1). In the second week of March, South Korea recorded continuous drops in the number of
daily new infections as massive testing of the followers of a religious sect in the south-eastern city of
Daegu, the epicentre of COVID-19, was nearing its end; thereafter, the number of cases in Gyeonggi
Province gradually decreased.
However, clusters of infections in Gyeonggi Province raised concerns about further community
spread, with a resurgence of cases in the province occurring in late May and resulting in the highest peak
in early June. Between 1-13 June, an average of 14 new cases were reported each day in Gyeonggi
Province. The second peak of Rt in the region occurred on 12 May, with an estimated value of Rt at 4.8 (95%
CrI: 3.0-7.0) and the doubling time estimated at 7.5 (95% CI: 5.4, 8.6) days (Table 1). Since its second
peak, Rt gradually decreased (Figure 4); however, a series of sporadic clusters have continued to occur.
The major clusters in Gyeonggi Province included Grace River Church (67), Coupang warehouse (67),
nightclubs (59), Richway (58), Uijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital (50), Guro-gu call centre/Bucheon
SaengMyeongSu Church (50), door-to-door sales in the Seoul Metropolitan Region (32), and Yangcheongu sports facility (28). As of 19 July, the number of local cases in Gyeonggi Province was 1,027 (10.4% of
the total reported cases in South Korea), including 29 deaths, with an Rt estimated at 0.8 (Figure 4). The
incidence rate in the province was estimated at 108 per million.

Gyeongbuk Province
The first case in the Sincheonji cult cluster (the largest COVID-19 cluster in South Korea) appeared
on 18 February, resulting in sustained transmission chains, with 39% of the cases associated with the

church cluster in Gyeongbuk Province. Therefore, the virus alert level was raised to "red" (the highest
level) on 23 February, and health authorities focused on halting the spread of the virus in Daegu and
Gyeongbuk Provinces. Figure 5 shows that the peak of the epidemic occurred in the first week of March
(with a reproduction number greater than one until 9 March) (Figure 5). The doubling time in Gyeongbuk
Province reached the values as short as 3.6 (96% CI: 3.5, 4.0) days (Table 1). As of 18 July, the number of
cases in Gyeongbuk Province was 1,393, including 54 deaths. Among these cases, 566 were related to the
Shincheonji cluster. The incidence rate in Gyeongbuk Province was 523 per million, accounting for 10.2%
of all confirmed cases in South Korea (KCDC, 2020a). The major clusters in Gyeongbuk Province were
linked to Cheongdo Daenam Hospital (119 cases), Bonghwa Pureun Nursing Home (68 cases),
Gyeongsan Seo Convalescent Hospital (66 cases), pilgrimage to Israel (41 cases), Yecheon-gun (40 cases),
and Gumi Elim Church (11 cases).

City of Daegu
The epicentre of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been identified in Daegu, a city of 2.5
million people, approximately 150 miles south-east of Seoul. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in Daegu
was attributed to a superspreading event in a religious group called Shincheonji, resulting in an explosive
outbreak with 4,511 infections in the city of Daegu, resulting in the relatively short doubling time, i.e. 2.8
(95% CI: 2.5, 4.0) days (Table 1 and Figure 6). Other major clusters in Daegu included the second Mi-Ju
Hospital (196 cases), Hansarang Convalescent Hospital (124 cases), Daesil Convalescent Hospital (101
cases), and Fatima Hospital (39 cases). Daegu was the most severely affected area in South Korea with
6,932 cumulative cases as of 19 July, accounting for 51.0% of all confirmed cases in Korea. According to
our model, the number of new cases based on the onset of symptoms was estimated to be the highest on
27 February; the number gradually decreased thereafter. Accordingly, the estimated ௧ was above two

until 27 February and dropped below one on 5 March, although recent sporadic infections caused the Rt to
fluctuate around one (Figure 6).

Discussion
The estimates of the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Korea displayed substantial
spatiotemporal variation. Indeed, several factors influence the value of the reproduction number, including
the transmissibility of an infectious agent, individual susceptibility, individual contact rates, and control
measures (Anderson and May, 1991). Our results indicate that the effective reproduction number for
COVID-19 declined to low levels after the first wave and straddled around the epidemic threshold of 1.0
in March and April suggesting that social distancing measures had a significant effect on mitigating the
spread of the novel coronavirus. Estimates of early national Rt for South Korea retrieved from other
studies, 2.9 (95% CrI 2.0-3.9) in February (Ryu et al., 2020) and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) in March, are in
good agreement with our Rt estimates (Zhuang et al., 2020).
Our results suggest that South Korea has experienced two spatially heterogenous waves of the novel
coronavirus. At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have experienced two waves whereas
Daegu and Gyeongbuk Provinces are yet to experience the second wave of the disease. The highest
epidemic peak occurred in Daegu and Gyeongbuk Province in late February and early March, with Rt
estimated at 4.4 (95% CrI: 2.6-6.6) and 3.5 (95% CrI: 0.9-7.3), respectively. During their epidemic peak,
the doubling time was estimated at 2.8 (95% CI 2.5, 4.0) days and 3.6 (95% CI 3.5, 4.0) days in Daegu
and Gyeongbuk Province, respectively, which is similar to prior estimates of doubling time, 3.8 (95% CI:
3.4-4.2) days (Lee et al., 2020). Similarly, in Gyeonggi Province and Seoul, the first wave was observed
in late February and early March, respectively. However, sporadic clusters of infections appeared in Seoul
and near Gyeonggi Province, immediately after the government eased its strict nationwide social
distancing guidelines on May 6. This resurgence of infections in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province (i.e., the
province surrounding Seoul) after a sustained period with fewer than 5 cases per day in each region, led to

the second epidemic wave with sub-exponential growth dynamics. In Seoul, the mean doubling time
decreased from 7.5 (95% CI: 7.0, 8.2) days during the first wave to 6.0 (95% CI: 5.4, 6.7) days during the
second wave, indicating faster transmission during the case resurgences. Accordingly, our findings
revealed sustained local transmission in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, with the estimated reproduction
number estimated above one until the end of May. In late May, the country implemented two weeks of
strict social distancing measures incorporating stringent virus prevention guidelines for the metropolitan
area. These measures included the shutting down of public facilities and regulating bars and karaoke
rooms. In the second week of June, South Korea decided to indefinitely extend a period of strict social
distancing measures, as nearly all locally transmitted cases were in the metropolitan area.
Although Korea has a relatively low number of reported cases compared to other countries including
the U.S. and China, it is believed that South Korea is currently experiencing yet another resurgence of the
virus (WHO). Originally, South Korean authorities predicted a resurgence of the virus in the fall or winter;
however, this possible second wave started in and around Seoul, which, with 51.6 million inhabitants,
accounts for about half of the entire population of the country. Secondary waves of the disease can result
from multiple factors, including easing of travel restrictions and resuming social activities especially in
the high population density areas of Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. Furthermore, a substantial proportion
of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic (Mizumoto et al., 2020); thus, they are not detected by surveillance
systems, resulting in the underestimation of the epidemic growth curve. It was also recently reported that
individuals aged 20-39 years in South Korea drove the COVID-19 epidemic throughout society with
multiple rebounds, and an increase in infection among the elderly was significantly associated with an
elevated transmission risk among young adults (Yu et al., 2020).
Our study is not exempt of limitations including the lack of dates of symptoms onset for all of the
cases, relying on a statistical reconstruction of the epidemic curve by dates of symptoms onset as in a
previous study (Shim et al., 2020a). Overall, using most up-to-date epidemiological data from South
Korea, our study highlights the effectiveness of strong control interventions in South Korea and
