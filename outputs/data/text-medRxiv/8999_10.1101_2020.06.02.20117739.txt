Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 affects all aspects of human life. Detection
platforms that are efficient, rapid, accurate, specific, sensitive, and user friendly are urgently
needed to manage and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR based methods are the gold
standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, these methods require trained personnel,
sophisticated infrastructure, and a long turnaround time, thereby limiting their usefulness.
Reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a one-step nucleic
acid amplification method conducted at a single temperature, has been used for colorimetric
virus detection. CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13 systems, which possess collateral activity
against ssDNA and RNA, respectively, have also been harnessed for virus detection. Here, we
built an efficient, rapid, specific, sensitive, user-friendly SARS-CoV-2 detection module that
combines the robust virus amplification of RT-LAMP with the specific detection ability of
SARS-CoV-2 by CRISPR-Cas12. Furthermore, we combined the RT-LAMP-CRISPR-Cas12
module with lateral flow cells to enable highly efficient point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Our iSCAN SARS-CoV-2 detection module, which exhibits the critical features of a robust
molecular diagnostic device, should facilitate the effective management and control of COVID19.

Introduction
In late 2019, an outbreak of the novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread
throughout the world [1-3]. Based on the data shared by WHO, as of May 24th, over five million
people have tested positive for COVID-19, with a mortality of over 300,000 people worldwide.
Coronaviruses are large, positive-stranded RNA viruses with genome sizes ranging from ~27 to
~32 kb [4]. These viruses pose a serious challenge to human health due to their ability to infect a
wide variety of organisms, including avian and mammalian species. The rapid evolution of their
genomic RNA by recombination can lead to the generation of viral strains that are more virulent
or recalcitrant to therapeutic interventions than the original strains [5]. This is exemplified by the
recent emergence and outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2.

To curb the spread of this virus, countries throughout the globe have implemented strict
measures such as curfews, obligatory quarantines, social distancing, and travel bans. Although
these measures have been useful in preventing significant increases in the number of new cases,
they have put considerable pressure on the world economy and healthcare systems. Early
detection and large-scale screening are crucial for combating emerging infectious diseases,
particularly those with symptomatic features that are characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The facile transmissibility and delay in clinical manifestation of this virus often make it
impossible for governments and healthcare providers to assess the gravity of the situation and
implement preventive measures to stop the spread of the virus in a timely manner [10].
Unfortunately, as seen in too many cases, a delay in taking decisive action leads to rapid
propagation of the virus within a population, where it circulates before suddenly taking on
epidemic proportions [11]. From an epidemiological perspective, it is vital to rapidly identify and
isolate infected individuals. Timely implementation of counter-measures significantly reduces
the burden of the pandemic on society from both a public health and economic standpoint.
Furthermore, the lack of testing on an appropriately large scale makes it challenging to keep
track of the outbreak and to evaluate the success of the response measures. Therefore, early virus
detection and isolation of COVID-19 ‘positive’ individuals are crucial to limit virus transmission

and implementation of effective measures to control the spread of the virus and relieve the
burden on the healthcare system [12, 13].
Nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods are quite useful and informative compared to serological
methods, which are feasible only after antibodies have been produced and only provide
information about prior infection and not the current presence of the virus in a patient [14, 15].
The testing and isolation of asymptomatic carriers have proven quite effective in controlling viral
spread. Therefore, efficient, low-cost testing methods are required to enable the extensive and
recurrent testing of patients. Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is the most widely used
method for detecting RNA viruses. Due to its sensitivity and specificity, quantitative RT-PCR
(RT-qPCR) is currently the gold standard method for identifying the presence of SARS-CoV-2
[1, 16]. Although this method is sensitive and reliable, is not without limitations. RT-qPCR
requires highly trained personnel, sophisticated infrastructure, and the transport of samples to
central laboratories, thereby limiting its usefulness for large-scale point-of-care diagnostics [17].
In addition, this technique is difficult to implement during emergency situations such as the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when thousands of samples must be analyzed as quickly as possible to
assess treatment options and prevent further spread of the disease [18]. Therefore, methods that
conform to the ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust,
Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users) features of the point-of-care (POC) diagnostic are
urgently needed to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through effective control and
management measures [19].

Several approaches have been employed for pathogen diagnostics using inexpensive reagents
and simple equipment, leading to effective testing in low-resource settings. For example,
isothermal amplification approaches based on recombinase polymerase amplification or loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which are conducted at a single temperature, have
been employed for POC diagnostics for various pathogens, thus providing a very effective
alternative to PCR-based methods [14, 20]. Reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP), which
uses a suitable isothermal reverse transcriptase to reverse transcribe a specific sequence of virus
RNA to DNA coupled with isothermal reactions such as LAMP, can be used to detect RNA
viruses in a single reaction at a single temperature [21]. However, these methods have some

drawbacks, including low specificity, a high rate of false positives, and difficulty of adapting
these techniques for effective POC diagnostics for pandemics such as COVID-19 [22, 23].
The CRISPR-Cas systems are molecular immunity machines that provide bacterial and archaeal
species with immunity against invading nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative
plasmids [24, 25]. These systems have been used to engineer the genomes and transcriptomes of
all transformable species [26-28]. One intriguing feature of some of these systems, including
those employing variants of Cas12, Cas13, and Cas14, is their collateral, non-specific activity
following recognition and cleavage of the specific target [29-31]. CRISPR-Cas systems,
including CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, exhibit robust collateral activity against singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA targets, respectively. Such collateral activity provides the
basis for highly specific, sensitive approaches for nucleic acid detection [32, 33]. For example,
SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) and DETECTR
(DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) detection have attracted substantial
attention [30, 34]. CRISPR-based diagnostic methods exploit the efficiency and simplicity of
different isothermal amplification approaches, such as LAMP and recombinase polymerase
amplification, which achieve highly specific, sensitive amplification of a few copies of the
targeted nucleic acid at single temperature in a short period of time, eliminating the need for
thermocycling steps, and are therefore favored for POC diagnostics where low-cost and ease of
use are needed. Although these systems hold great promise for developing an effective
diagnostic, employing these techniques as POC diagnostics amenable to massive-scale field
deployment remains challenging.
In the current study, to address the challenge of SARS-CoV-2 detection, we established a system
involving RT-LAMP coupled with CRISPR-Cas12 for the rapid, specific, accurate, sensitive
detection of SARS-CoV-2 and named this system iSCAN (in vitro Specific CRISPR-based
Assay for Nucleic acids detection). Our iSCAN platform is 1) rapid, as the RT-LAMP and
CRISPR-Cas12 reaction takes less than 1 h; 2) specific, because detection depends on the
identification and subsequent cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences by the Cas12
enzyme; 3) field-deployable, as only simple equipment is required; and 4) easy to use, as the
colorimetric reaction coupled to lateral flow immunochromatography makes the assay results
easy to assess. Our iSCAN approach is suitable for large-scale, in-field deployment for the early

detection of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, allowing them to be effectively isolated and quarantined, thus
limiting the spread of the virus. Our SARS-CoV-2 detection kit has been validated using
extracted RNAs from clinical samples from COVID-19 positive patients, providing the
possibility of widespread deployment for virus detection.

Results
Establishment of RT-LAMP for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a low-resource
environment
SARS-CoV-2 testing faces many hurdles, including the availability of critical reagents, highlytrained technical personnel, and sophisticated equipment. Hence, the ability to produce
diagnostic reagents in-house is vital in epidemic situations. Therefore, we set out to build a
SARS-CoV-2 end-to-end detection platform that is sensitive, specific, easy-to-use, and low cost
to facilitate its field deployment on a massive scale. LAMP reactions employ DNA polymerases
that possess strand-displacement activities, such as the Bst DNA polymerase large fragment, for
efficient amplification of the target DNA [21]. By supplementing the LAMP reaction with a
suitable isothermal reverse transcriptase, reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) can be used to
detect RNA by reverse transcribing the target RNA and subsequent DNA amplification in one
step. Therefore, we expressed and purified recombinant Bst DNA polymerase large fragment
(referred to as Bst LF) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus [35], and the synthetic, directed
evolution-derived RT ‘xenopolymerase’ RTx enzymes [36]. The catalytic activities and
performance of the purified proteins for LAMP with the purified Bst LF, and RT-LAMP with
RTx and Bst LF were assayed and compared with commercial Bst and RTx enzymes using
published RT-LAMP primers designed against the SARS-CoV-2 genome [37]. Our in-house
produced proteins showed efficient and consistent LAMP and RT-LAMP amplifications
comparable to the commercial enzymes (Supplementary Figure 1A).

Next, we designed, built, and tested several sets of LAMP primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2
genome. The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of ~30 kb positive single-stranded RNA with a 5 ′

cap structure and 3 poly-A tail containing several genes characteristic of coronaviruses, such as
′

S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) genes (Figure 1A). Other elements

of the genome, such as ORF1a and ORF1b, encode non-structural proteins, including RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [8, 9]. We targeted two regions in the N and E genes. The
N gene at the 3′ end of the virus genome is highly conserved among coronaviruses. We designed
LAMP primers to generate ~200 bp amplification products to ensure robust amplification
sufficient for LAMP-based detection. We conducted RT-LAMP experiments on synthetic SARSCoV-2 sequences. We identified primer sets, for N and E genes, which were able to specifically
and efficiently amplify the synthetic virus fragments, but not the controls.

Efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 via RT-LAMP coupled with CRISPR-Cas12a
The sensitivity of RT-LAMP is comparable with the RT-PCR. However, the specificity of the
reactions and the visualization of the results may be complicated due to primer-dimer formation,
non-specific amplification, and cross-contamination when running a large number of samples
simultaneously. Therefore, to develop a highly sensitive and specific detection system, we
coupled CRISPR-Cas12 with RT-LAMP target amplification to establish a binary system for
SARS-CoV-2 detection. To this end, we purified the class II, type V Lachnospiraceae bacterium
ND2006 (LbCas12a) orthologue.

We assessed its programmable (specific) cis-cleavage activity against dsDNA targets and
(collateral) trans-cleavage activity on ssDNA non-targeted sequences. Purified LbCas12a
assembled with crRNAs targeting dsDNA fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N or E genes exhibited
endonuclease activity on the targeted dsDNA, confirming the catalytic cis-cleavage activity of
the purified Cas12a (Supplementary Figure 1B). To assess the collateral activity of the purified
LbCas12a protein, the specific dsDNA targeting reaction was supplemented with non-targeted
fluorophore quencher (FQ)-labeled ssDNA reporters. Cas12a catalyzed the efficient degradation
of the ssDNA FQ reporters as measured by the fluorescent signal, which was generated only in
the presence of the specific dsDNA targets and specific crRNA, indicating the active collateral
cleavage activity of the purified enzyme (Supplementary Figure 1C, D).

To establish our iSCAN system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we used RT-LAMP for virus
detection and amplification coupled with CRISPR-Cas12 as a specificity factor. The positive

signal from Cas12 provides a specific and accurate signal for virus detection. Collateral ssDNAFQ reporter is cleaved upon Cas12a binding and cleavage of the target virus sequence in the RTLAMP amplification products (Figure 1B). We designed crRNAs specific to the SARS-CoV-2 N
and E gene genomic regions amplified with the primer sets identified in the primer screening
assays.

We tested the activity and specificity of our two-pot iSCAN system using an FQ reporter assay.
We performed RT-LAMP using the E gene-specific RT-LAMP primers and synthetic SARSCoV-2 genome. Subsequently, we introduced the RT-LAMP product to Cas12a protein preassembled with crRNAs specific to the E gene amplicon, non-specific crRNA, or without crRNA
in the presence of FQ-ssDNA reporter. Cas12a cleaved the ssDNA reporters only in the presence
of specific crRNA and RT-LAMP amplicons, confirming the specificity and activity of our
systems (Figure 1C).

Next, we quantitatively compared the sensitivity of our system to that of the approved SARSCoV-2 CDC RT-qPCR assays to determine the limit of detection (LoD). We conducted our twopot iSCAN assays with various dilutions of the synthetic viral RNA ranging from 0 to 20000
copies per reaction. The LoD assays showed that the iSCAN reactions could detect down to 10
RNA copies per reaction, indicating the high sensitivity of our assay (Figure 1D).

To further optimize the assay, we systemically evaluated different RT-LAMP and Cas12a
detection timing to determine the time needed to detect the signal. Using the lowest
concentration identified in the LoD assay, we added RT-LAMP products from different
amplification time points, including 5, 10, 20, and 30 min to crRNA-Cas12a detection complex
along with the fluorescence reporter. The samples were incubated at 37°C for different times (5,
10, 20, and 30 min), and the fluorescent signal generated from the reporter by the Cas12a
collateral activity upon target recognition was measured. Our assay reliably detected the positive
signal with 20 min of RT-LAMP followed by 20 min of Cas12a detection comparable to the
stronger fluorescent signal with prolonged RT-LAMP and Cas12a detection (Supplementary
Figure 2).

Validation of RT-LAMP coupled CRISPR-Cas12a for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
clinical samples
To validate our detection system for application with real samples from patients, we first
assessed the capability of our iSCAN assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid extracted from
nasopharyngeal swabs of five different patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with RTqPCR assays and two patients who tested negative (Supplementary File 2). The positive samples
had different Ct values ranging from 15 to 40 with the CDC qPCR N gene primer sets (IDT,
Catalogue #10006606). Using fluorescence-based detection with at least three replicates for
each sample, our iSCAN system targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E gene showed 100% agreement
with RT-qPCR results (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3).

To facilitate the effective detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a low-resource environment, we sought to
simplify the use of iSCAN for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we coupled lateral flow
immunochromatography with our iSCAN detection system. Lateral flow strips are user-friendly
and straight-forward, and can facilitate the development of home testing for SARS-CoV-2. We
evaluated our system for POC diagnostics with lateral flow readouts using commercial lateral
flow strips. Lateral flow assays showed 100% concordance with results obtained with
fluorescence-based detection (Figure1F).

Next, we evaluated our iSCAN assay by testing on total RNAs extracted from an additional 24
nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 3 negative patients
(Supplementary File 2). We assayed the performance of our system with E and N gene primers
and crRNAs. We observed low sensitivity of our assay when using the E gene target, with 8 out
of 21 positive samples testing positive, and 3 out of 3 negative samples testing negative with
fluorescence-based readouts (Supplementary Figure 4). However, when we used the N gene
assay, we observed a significant increase in the sensitivity of the assay, where 18 samples tested
positive out of the 21 positive samples with qPCR (~86%), and the 3 negative samples were
diagnosed correctly in agreement with the qPCR data (100%) (Figure 1G). We next tested the
performance our iSCAN N gene assay using the simple lateral flow readouts. We observed high
agreement between the fluorescent-based detection and the lateral flow readout results
(Supplementary Figure 5).

SARS-CoV-2 detection via RT-LAMP coupled CRISPR-Cas12b
Our two-pot iSCAN systems, employing RT-LAMP coupled with CRISPR-Cas12a, reliably and
specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 from clinical patient samples. However, developing virus
detection modalities suitable for POC testing might require minimal liquid handling and singlepot reactions to facilitate wide adoption and in-field deployment. Therefore, we attempted to
further simplify our iSCAN system and develop a one-pot assay by employing the thermophilic
variants of Cas12b that can catalytically function in the same temperature range as RT-LAMP.
To this end, we purified Cas12b from Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (AacCas12b) and Cas12b
from Alicyclobacillus acidophilus (AapCas12b) variants [38, 39]. We confirmed the cis activity
of these proteins on PCR products of the target sequences using sgRNA sequence of the
AacCas12b variant. Our data show that both Cas12b variants were capable of inducing doublestrand breaks using the same sgRNA at 62°C, and had robust collateral activities when incubated
with ssDNA FQ reporter (Supplementary Figure 6). However, because AapCas12b showed
enhanced cis cleavage activity at 62°C, we chose to proceed with this Cas12b variant.

The goal of utilizing the thermophilic Cas12b variants was to develop a simple one-pot and
single temperature detection modality that minimizes liquid handling. This can be achieved by
mixing all amplification and CRISPR- based detection reagents simultaneously in one pot, which
allows simultaneous target amplification and detection. Thus, using the N gene assay, we
attempted to verify the feasibility of performing SARS-CoV-2 detection in a one-pot assay
format using the synthetic virus RNA in one-pot detection reaction mixtures containing
AapCas12b, sgRNA, ssDNA-reporters, and RT-LAMP amplification reagents, and incubated the
reaction mixtures at 62°C for 1 h. The one-pot detection system was capable of detecting the
viral RNA, albeit at lower efficiency compared to the two-pot system (Supplementary Figure
7A). When we visualized the RT-LAMP product from one-pot assay on an agarose gel, we found
weak amplification of the target virus RNA. Therefore, we hypothesized that the concurrent
presence of the active Cas12b–sgRNA complex in the same pot leads to the digestion of the
initial RT-LAMP product, which significantly affects the performance of the RT-LAMP
amplification, and thus the robustness of the detection.

To improve the performance of the one-pot detection, we separated the Cas12b enzyme from the
rest of the detection components by adding the Cas12b protein in a droplet on the tube wall, then
allowed the RT-LAMP reaction to proceed before mixing the Cas12b with the other reaction
components. We observed an enhanced RT-LAMP amplification of the target and improved
detection performance using this “spotted” one-pot reaction with synthetic viral RNA
(Supplementary Figure 7A). In the spotted one-pot reaction, AapCas12b consistently achieved a
LoD of 10 copies per reaction (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 7B).

Next, we tested the ability of the AapCas12b-based detection system to detect SARS-CoV-2
RNAs in clinical samples (3 positive and 1 negative) using fluorescence-based and lateral flowbased readouts. AapCas12b was capable of detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using spotted onepot and all-mixed one-pot reactions (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 7C). Using the spotted
one-pot AapCas12b detection system, we tested the 24 clinical samples used with the Cas12a
based detection system. The performance of AapCas12b system was very similar to the
performance of Cas12a-based system, where 18 out of the 21 qPCR-positive samples showed a
positive signal, and the 3 qPCR negative samples showed negative results using fluorescencebased readouts (Figure 2C). However, when we tested the system on 17 of the positive samples
and 2 negative samples using lateral flow readouts, we consistently observed weak performance
measured by the weak signal on lateral flow readouts in positive samples compared to negative
ones, which compromised the interpretation of the results (Figure 2D).

Discussion
The COVID-19 outbreak poses an unprecedented public health challenge worldwide. The crucial
need for the large-scale detection of SARS-CoV-2 has made it urgent to develop local solutions
for creating sensitive, specific, low-cost, in-field deployable diagnostic kits. The biomanufacturing of assay reagents and simple portable machines for easy use at POC will facilitate
the widespread, large-scale detection of this virus. In this study, we established iSCAN, a system
involving RT-LAMP coupled with CRISPR-Cas12, as an efficient detection module for COVID19. We designed, screened, and tested different sets of LAMP primers and identified a few

primer sets for specifically and efficiently amplifying the SARS-CoV-2 E and N genes. Due to
huge disruptions in the supply chain worldwide, we employed the in-house purified RTx and
BstI enzymes for the RT-LAMP reactions.

The addition of CRISPR reagents provides important specificity to the assay. Although the
results of LAMP reactions can be visualized with a pH-sensitive dye upon DNA amplification,
false amplification, cross-contamination, and the formation of primer-dimers may lead to false
signals [22, 23]. Therefore, a specificity factor is needed to ascertain the identity of the
amplification products and whether these products are derived from virus sequences. Because
CRISPR-Cas12 cuts DNA only in the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, the Cas12 enzyme
serves as a specificity factor for RT-LAMP. RT-LAMP polymerases can be used for reverse
transcription of the viral genome and subsequent amplification, producing a sufficient DNA
template for CRISPR-Cas12 to enable complete virus detection in 1 h in one-pot or two-pot
assays, depending on the Cas12 variant employed in the detection system. We optimized RTLAMP to successfully and reproducibly detect SARS-CoV-2. To ensure that the amplified RTLAMP products are derived from genuine virus sequences, we coupled RT-LAMP and CRISPRCas12-based detection. RT-LAMP coupled with CRISPR-Cas12 offers a binary result of RTLAMP and Cas12 activity, providing a highly specific, robust virus detection modality for
SARS-CoV-2.

The LoD of the iSCAN system is comparable with the minimum level required to detect the
virus in clinical samples by qRT-PCR. Minimal sample processing is sufficient for the iSCAN
system to detect SARS-CoV-2, enabling large-scale screening. Our iSCAN system for SARSCoV-2 detection is portable and can easily be deployed in the field due to its simplicity and low
cost (2–5 USD/reaction).

We have adjusted our iSCAN assays to make them amenable to use by lay users without
specialized equipment (Figure 3), but have retained some complexity to assure accurate assays.
For example, although one-pot detection systems are favored over two-pot detection systems for
onsite detection (Figure 3), our data show that mixing various components in one pot leads to a
substantial reduction in detection performance and sensitivity. Further optimization of the one-

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.20117739; this version posted June 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

pot detection assay could help improve the performance of this system. Such optimization would
involve screening different Cas12b variants and testing different isothermal amplification
methods. Cas12a can be further developed as a one-pot detection system by employing special
tubes that allow some reaction components to be isolated before use.

The iSCAN system can be further simplified through the use of cellular extracts harboring assay
reagents to maximize product integrity during shipping and handling. This would allow a lay
user to simply mix, incubate, and vortex the sample and visualize the assay results. The largescale production of these reagents in various forms is feasible, including bacterial extracts or
freeze-dried cells, allowing large-scale in-field deployment in low resource environments [40].
The calorimetric visualization of the test results does not require special equipment and can be
conducted by the naked eye or using a simple portable machine. We also predict that manifolds
for both the RT-LAMP and CRISPR-Cas12 reactions could be designed to enable sample
processing, reaction mixing, and assay results to be obtained in a closed system to allow nonhealthcare staff to perform these assays.

In addition to providing high specificity, the iSCAN assays can be easily customized as the virus
mutates. The iSCAN two-pot and one-pot systems using RT-LAMP coupled with CRISPRCas12 allow SARS-CoV-2 to be visually detected with a detection limit comparable to that of
qRT-PCR. This detection module couples the robustness of the RT-LAMP assay with the
specificity of CRISPR-Cas12, resulting in an efficient and reproducible detection system.
Because new mutations could occur in the current virus strain, iSCAN can easily be tailored to
detect any virus strain and to differentiate between different strains and determine the dominance
of a specific strain in a certain location or population.

Moreover, the iSCAN assays can be used for high-throughput testing. Various detection
modules, including GeneXpert, Cephied, and ID NOW by Abbot are low throughput and require
the use of a single machine for each sample, which may be impractical for low-resource
environments and where large-scale testing in a short time window is needed. Because
asymptomatic virus transmission has been reported, and initially negative results may not be
conclusive, regular testing may be required for patients with symptoms and their asymptomatic

primary and secondary contacts. Our iSCAN system is suitable for conducting multiple
consecutive tests at the POC. Because the viral load in a patient plays a significant role in the
assay results, regular testing is required. The development of the iSCAN system as a POC
SARS-CoV-2 testing modality would enable affordable and regular testing, which is crucial for
reducing false negatives and identifying clusters of infection as early as they arise. To facilitate
sample collection and testing, a patient’s saliva could be used for virus detection [41], and the
iSCAN module could be developed as an in-home SARS-CoV-2 testing kit in the future. Our
iSCAN detection platform can be designed to differentiate between coronaviruses and identify
specific SARS-CoV-2 strains. Therefore, the iSCAN detection system could greatly facilitate the
effective management and control of virus spread, specifically in high-risk areas, including
clinics, airports, and low resource areas where the test could be conducted and results obtained in
a short time.

The iSCAN detection module might not require a nucleic acid extraction step and may be
compatible with different types of samples, including saliva and nasal swabs. Furthermore, quick
nucleic acid extraction could be coupled with iSCAN to speed up the detection and bypass the
need to conduct an RNA extraction step. We envision that iSCAN could be used to assess
patient-collected saliva samples in a tube with extraction buffer that is compatible with RTLAMP and CRISPR-Cas12 reactions. The iSCAN detection module will ensure the safety of
both healthcare personnel and laboratory staff. We aim to develop the current iSCAN system
further for lay users and POC as well as in-home testing, which will help produce quick results
and prevent transmission of the virus. Therefore, our iSCAN system could help provide
physicians and healthcare staff with the answers they need for better, more timely patientmanagement decisions to mitigate the spread of the virus and its impact on the overwhelmed
healthcare system during the outbreak.

Other versions of iSCAN could be developed in the future for multiplex targeting of different
virus strains and the simultaneous identification of other pathogens. Although we have shown
that iSCAN works quite efficiently with lateral flow cells, inexpensive visualizers of the
reporters could be employed to increase the throughput of the assays and more rapidly produce
results from a large number of samples. Furthermore, this represents an effective alternative

should the supply of lateral flow cells become limited or disrupted. Other DIY modalities could
be developed to couple the assay reactions and test results with a smartphone to allow the results
to be communicated rapidly. In conclusion, the iSCAN virus detection platform should enable
robust testing on a massive scale in low-resource environments, thereby helping to mitigate the
transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 and providing effective management of the COVID-19
pandemic.

Material and methods
Nucleic acid preparations
The control SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA sequences used in this study were synthetic RNA from
Twist Bioscience, 102024 diluted to (1x103 RNA copies/microliter). For Cas12 DNA cleavage
assays, dsDNA substrates were generated by either PCR amplification from SARSCoV2_N_Positive Control vector (IDT, 10006625) using forward (N gene-F) and reverse primer
(N gene-R) (Supplementary Table 2) for N gene, or was designed and ordered as dsDNA
gBlocks (IDT) for E gene (Supplementary Table 3). The gblocks were cloned into pJet2.1
(Thermo Scientific, K1231) vector and the resulting plasmids harboring the clones were used for
PCR. PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit following
manufacturer’s instructions. To assess the activity of the purified Bst LF via LAMP reaction, the
N gene PCR amplicon was used as template in the LAMP reaction. In vitro transcription was
carried out using TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific K0441)
following manufacturer’s instructions. For LbCas12a crRNAs, templates for in vitro
transcription were generated using single-stranded DNA oligos containing a T7 promoter,
scaffold and spacer in reverse complement orientation (IDT), which were then annealed to T7
forward primer in taq DNA polymerase buffer (Invitrogen). For Cas12b sgRNAs, the AacCas12b
90 nt-long sgRNA scaffold was synthesized and ordered as sense and anti-sense ssDNA
ultramers containing the T7 promoter at the 5` end (IDT). The two ssDNA strands were annealed
in taq DNA polymerase buffer to generate T7-Cas12b sgRNA scaffold. The scaffold was used as

a template for PCR with T7 forward primer and reverse primers containing 20 nt spacer
sequences. All DNA oligos and substrates are listed in (Supplementary Table 2 and 4) The in
vitro transcribed sgRNAs were purified using MEGAclear™ Transcription Clean-Up Kit
(Thermo Scientific AM1908) following manufacturer’s instructions.

Protein purification
Bst LF DNA polymerase was induced at OD600 0.7 with 100 ng/mL tetracycline-HCl at 37 0C for
3 hours and the pellet was collected. Bst LF DNA polymerase was purified following Li et. al
2017 protocol [35, 42]. The collected protein fractions were quantified, and aliquots were flash
freezed in liquid nitrogen. RTx reverse transcriptase was purified following Bhadra et. al 2020
protocol [43]. The collected protein fractions were quantified, and aliquots were flash freezed in
liquid nitrogen. LbCas12a, AacCas12b, AapCas12b recombinant proteins were purified
following Chen et. al 2018 protocol [30]
Assessment of the activity and functionality of in-house produced enzymes.
To confirm the polymerization activity of the purified Bst LF DNA polymerase enzyme LAMP
reaction was assembled and carried out at 62 0C. The commercial Bst enzyme Bst 2.0 WarmStart
DNA Polymerase (NEB) was used as per manufacturer’s instructions as control. As initial
confirmation, the reported LAMP primers designed against SARS-CoV-2 were used [37]
(Supplementary table1). The activity of the purified RTx reverse transcriptase enzyme was
confirmed by single enzyme RT-PCR reaction following Bhadra et. al 2020 protocol [43]. The
Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (102024 Twist Bioscience) was used as input RNA
template. The one step RT-PCR was carried out with cycling conditions: 60°C for 30 minutes,
95°C for 10 minutes and 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds followed by 55°C for 30 seconds and
68 °C. The amplified product was separated on 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR-safe dye. The
dsDNA cleavage and collateral ssDNA degradation activities of Cas12a and Cas12b proteins
were confirmed following previously described protocols [30, 38]
Design and screening of LAMP primers
Different primer sets targeting several regions of the N gene and E gene of the SARS-CoV-2
genome (GenBank accession number MN908947) were designed using PrimerExplorer v5

software (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). Optimal sets that showed the best performance were
determined by conducting LAMP assays to detect specific targets. (Supplementary Table 1).
Screening of the best performing and most sensitive LAMP primers was done by running RTLAMP as described below.
Two-pot iSCAN detection assay
The iSCAN detection assays were performed in two steps. In the first step, RT-LAMP was
performed to reverse transcribe and pre-amplify the viral RNA to generate dsDNA substrates for
Cas12 enzymes. All the reagents for LAMP reactions were assembled on ice and combined in a
single reaction mixture of 2.5 L 10X isothermal amplification buffer (1X, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH

Next, for Cas12 detection assays, 250 nM LbCas12a (500 nM for AacCas12b and AapCas12b)
was first pre-incubated with 250 nM (500 nM for AacCas12b and AapCas12b) of specific (or

diluted 4 times with 1x binding buffer. For fluorescence-based detection, for Cas12a 250 nM and
for Cas12b, 500 nM of fluorophore-quencher (FQ) reporter (5'-/56-FAM/TTATT/3IABKFQ/-3',
IDT) or DNase alert substrate (11-02-01-02, IDT) and 2ul of the RT-LAMP reaction was added
to the pre-assembled Cas12-sgRNA RNP complexes and incubated at 37 0C (62 0C for Cas12b)
for 10 - 30 mins. End-point fluorescence detection was monitored using a Tecan plate reader
(Tecan 200).
For lateral flow detection, the Cas12 detection reaction was assembled as described above with
modifications. Lateral flow cleavage reporter (5'-/56-FAM/TTATTATT/3Bio/-3', IDT) was
added to the reaction at a final concentration of 500 nM in 100 ul reaction volume along with the
2 ul RT-LAMP product, and the reaction was incubated at 37Cο (62 0C for Cas12b) for 10 – 30
minutes. Upon completion of the reaction, lateral flow readouts were performed by placing

detection reaction and results were observed after 5 minutes. Interpretation of lateral flow results
was done as follows, a single band, close to the sample pad indicated a negative result (control
band), whereas a single band close to the top of the strip (test band) or two bands (test and
control) indicated a positive result (Figure 1B).

One-pot iSCAN detection assays

Clinical sample collection and RNA extraction
Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by the physicians from COVID-19
suspected patients in Ministry of Health hospitals in the Western region in Saudi Arabia and
placed in 2-mL screw-capped cryotubes containing 1 mL of TRIZOL for inactivation and
transport. The sample tubes were sprayed with 70% ethanol enveloped with absorbent tissue and

placed in individual and sealed biohazard bags with labels accordingly. The bags are then placed
in leak-proof boxes and sprayed with 70% ethanol before placing them in a dry ice container for
subsequent transfer to King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). Total
RNAs from the samples (that contained the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNAs) was then extracted
following instructions as described in the CDC EUA-approved protocol using the DIRECTZOL
KIT from ZymoBiomics (Direct-Zol RNA Miniprep (Zymo Research); catalog #R2070)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for detection of positive SARS-CoV2 RNA
sample.
RT-PCR was conducted by using the oligonucleotide primer/probe (Integrated DNA
Technologies, catalog #10006606) and Superscript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum
Taq Polymerase (catalog #12574-026) as per the manufacturer’s protocol on extracted RNA
sample. The RNA sample for SARS nCoV 2019 considered as positive when the cycle threshold
(Ct) value for both E and N genes was

≤

36 and negative when the Ct value was more than > 36

for both genes.
Acknowledgments
We would like to thank members of the genome engineering and synthetic biology laboratory for
insightful discussions and technical support. We thank Professor Andrew Ellington for providing
the RTx and BstI clones. This work was supported, in part, by the Smart Health Initiative at
KAUST and the IAF grant from the KAUST IED to MM. The samples were collected from
patients providing verbal consent to the treating doctor after they read the patient consent form,
or the doctor explained the content of consent form to the patient. Hence, as per the approved
protocol, the doctors took samples only after receiving verbal consent from a concerned patient
(due to infection hazard and no family member being available next to the patients due to
infection control guidelines) and the treating doctor signed on the consent form on behalf of the
patient before any sample collection took place. We have obtained the necessary ethical approval
from the Saudi-MOH and the Mass Gathering directorate in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for the
collection of the samples (Saudi MOH Approval #: H-02-K-076-0420-285, dated 13.04.2020;
KAUST Approval #: 20IBEC14). We thank Sara Mfarrej and Fathia Ben Rached for their help
during the handling of the clinical samples in KAUST.

Figure 3: Overview of the CRISPR-Cas based SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and
requirements.
A) Schematic illustration showing different Cas12-based detection modalities. The first row
depicts Cas12a-based two-pot reaction, where the RT-LAMP amplification of SARSCoV-2 nucleic acid is performed in the first tube. Then the RT-LAMP product is
transferred to a second tube for Cas12a-based detection. The second row depicts RTLAMP and Cas12b-based detection reagents, except for Cas12b-sgRNA complex, mixed
in a single reaction. Cas12b-sgRNA complex is temporary separated from the reaction
because it is added on the tube wall. After 30 min of RT-LAMP reaction, the Cas12bsgRNA complex is centrifuged into the reaction mix for target cleavage and
CRISPR/Cas-based detection, which takes place for an additional 15 min. In the third
row, simultaneous RT-LAMP amplification and CRISPR-based detection of SARS-CoV2 detection is performed in a single tube.
B) Minimal equipment and consumables required for iSCAN detection assay, which
includes a heat block, pipettes, pipette tips, sample tubes, and lateral flow strips.
