Abstract:

10

Understanding changes in infectiousness during COVID-19 infections is critical to assess the

11

effectiveness of public health measures such as contact tracing. Data from known source-

12

recipient pairs can be used to estimate the average infectiousness profile of infected

13

individuals, and to evaluate the proportion of presymptomatic transmissions. Here, we infer

14

the infectiousness profile of COVID-19 infections using a mechanistic approach, and show

15

that this method provides an improved fit to data from source-recipient pairs compared to

16

previous studies. Our results indicate a higher proportion of presymptomatic transmissions

17

than previously thought, with many transmissions occurring shortly before symptom onset.

18

High infectiousness immediately prior to symptom onset highlights the importance of contact

19

tracing, even if contacts from a short time window before symptom onset alone are traced.

Main text:

2

The precise proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions arising from non-symptomatic (either

3

presymptomatic or asymptomatic) infectors remains uncertain (1, 2). Statistical models can

4

be used to assess the relative contributions of presymptomatic and symptomatic transmission

5

using data from known source-recipient transmission pairs (3–6). The distributions of three

6

important epidemiological time periods – the generation time (i.e., the difference between the

7

infection times of the source and recipient) (3, 4, 7, 8), the time from onset of symptoms to

8

transmission (TOST) (4, 9, 10), and the serial interval (i.e., the difference between the

9

symptom onset times of the source and recipient) (4, 11) – can also be inferred. The

10

generation time and TOST distributions also indicate the average infectiousness profile of a

11

host at each time since infection and time since symptom onset, respectively (9, 12). This is

12

important for assessing the effectiveness of public health measures such as contact tracing (3)

13

and for deciding the duration of quarantine/isolation periods (13). Estimates of the generation

14

time distribution of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from transmission pair data have typically

15

involved an assumption that the infectiousness of a host is independent of their symptom

16

status (3, 7, 8, 14, 15). However, such an assumption may both be unjustified (15, 16) and

17

lead to a poor fit to data (4).

18
19

Here, we develop a mechanistic approach for inference from transmission pair data. Our

20

method provides an improved fit to data from SARS-CoV-2 transmission pairs compared to

21

previously used approaches, namely: (i) a model assuming that transmission and symptoms

22

are independent (3, 7, 8, 14), and (ii) a previous statistical method in which this assumption is

23

relaxed (4). We use the fitted models to infer the distributions of epidemiological time

24

intervals and the contribution of presymptomatic infectious individuals to transmission.

25

According to our best-fitting model, we find that the predicted proportion of presymptomatic

2

proportion of transmissions occurring in a short time window prior to symptom onset.

Finally, we consider the implications of our results for contact tracing.

Transmission pair data (Fig. 1A) generally comprise symptom onset dates for known source-

6

recipient pairs. These data may be supplemented with partial information about infection

7

times, consisting of a range of possible exposure dates for the source and/or recipient (3).

8

While the serial interval for each pair can be calculated directly from the data (with some

9

uncertainty, given the unknown precise times of symptom appearance on the onset dates

10

(17)), other time intervals, including the generation time and TOST (which is negative for

11

presymptomatic transmissions), are unobserved. In almost all previous approaches that have

12

been used to estimate the generation time distribution of SARS-CoV-2 from transmission

13

pair data (Fig. 1B, left panel), the infectiousness of the source at a given time since infection

14

is assumed to be independent of their incubation period (3, 7, 8, 14). In contrast, in our

15

mechanistic approach (Fig. 1B, right panel), which is based on compartmental modelling,

16

each infected host passes through three stages of infection – latent (E), presymptomatic

17

infectious (P), and symptomatic infectious (I). Infectiousness is assumed to be constant

18

during each stage but may vary between presymptomatic and symptomatic infectious hosts.

(the “variable infectiousness model”).

status (the “independent transmission and symptoms model”).
Following (4), we fitted each model to data from 191 SARS-CoV-2 transmission pairs

10

obtained by combining five different datasets (3, 9, 19–21). To account for uncertainty in the

11

precise times of symptom appearance within the day of onset for the source and recipient

12

(22), we used data augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The best fit to the

13

data was obtained using our mechanistic approach in which infectiousness varies between

14

presymptomatic infectious and symptomatic hosts (the variable infectiousness model; ΔAIC

15

= 0). The constant infectiousness model gave the next best fit (ΔAIC = 4.5), followed by the

16

Ferretti model (ΔAIC = 8.3). Finally, the standard assumption of independent transmission

17

and symptoms led to a significantly worse fit compared to the other models (ΔAIC = 44.6).

18
19

For each model, we calculated the predicted distributions of the generation time (Fig. 2A),

20

TOST (Fig. 2B) and serial interval (Fig. 2C) under the set of model parameters that gave the

21

best fit to the data. The empirical serial interval distribution is also plotted in Fig. 2C, for

22

visual confirmation of the goodness of fit of the different models. We found that the

23

variability in the generation time between individuals was lower for the independent

24

transmission and symptoms model compared to the other three models (Fig. 2A). On the

25

other hand, the TOST distribution was most concentrated around the time of symptom onset

estimate of 65% of transmissions occurring prior to symptom onset using our best-fitting

model is higher than estimated in previous studies that have fitted statistical models of

infectiousness using transmission pair data (3, 4, 9) – for example, estimates of 37% and 55%

The estimates in Fig. 3A describe the proportion of transmissions that occur prior to symptom

these estimates can be combined with the results of a previous study (1) in which the extent

of asymptomatic transmission (i.e., transmissions from individuals who never display

symptoms) was characterised (Fig. S2), to obtain estimates for the total proportion of non7

symptomatic (i.e., either presymptomatic or asymptomatic) transmissions in an entire

2

population of hosts for the different models (Fig. 3B). Again, the non-symptomatic

3

proportion was highest for the variable infectiousness model, and lowest for the independent

4

transmission and symptoms model.

5
6

Finally, we considered the implications of these results for contact tracing (Fig. 4). In Fig.

7

4A, we show the proportion of infectious contacts of hosts who go on to develop symptoms

8

that are identified if contacts are traced up to different times before the symptom onset time

9

of the index case (i.e., for different contact elicitation windows). Long duration contact

10

elicitation windows are impractical and place significant strain on contact tracing systems,

11

leading to contact elicitation windows of two days being used in countries such as the UK

12

(24) and USA (25). In the best-fitting variable infectiousness model, 84% of infectious

13

contacts are estimated to be identified when tracing up to 2 days before symptom onset (Fig.

14

4A, blue dashed). This is due to the clustering of transmission events around the symptom

15

onset time (cf. Fig. 2B) and compares to a lower estimate of only 74% if the standard

16

assumption of independence between transmission and symptoms is made (Fig. 4A, purple).

17

We also explored the effect of the timing of isolation of infected individuals identified

18

through contact tracing, and estimated the reduction in onwards transmissions from infected

19

contacts if contact tracing is conducted quickly (Fig. 4B). Compared to the best-fitting

20

variable infectiousness model, the standard independent transmission and symptoms model

21

estimated a similar reduction in transmission when a host was isolated within 4 days of

22

exposure, but under-predicted the efficacy of isolation later in infection. We assumed that

23

contact identification and isolation is perfectly effective in this analysis, but we also explored

24

the sensitivity of our results to this assumption in the Supplementary Materials. In each case

As we have shown, our mechanistic approach provides an improved fit to transmission pair

data, and predicts a higher proportion of transmissions occurring in a short time window

before symptom onset, compared to previous approaches. These conclusions are robust to the

14

exact incubation period distribution that we assumed (26) when fitting the different models to

15

transmission pair data (Fig. S4). Our best-fitting model outperforms a model predicated on a

16

critical assumption – that infectiousness is independent of symptom status – which underlies

17

most previous studies in which the generation time distribution of COVID-19 is estimated (3,

18

7, 8, 14). That assumption neglects potential relationships between symptoms and viral

shedding, as well as behavioural changes in response to symptom onset (18). Some

2

alternative assumptions have also been considered when fitting to transmission pair data,

3

such as the possibility that infectiousness depends only on the time since symptom onset,

4

independent of the time of infection (4, 27). If the serial interval is always positive, which is

5

not always the case for COVID-19 (11), this is equivalent to assuming that the serial interval

6

and generation time distributions are identical (15, 23, 28). In a previous study (4), another

7

model (the Ferretti model) was developed in which a host’s infectiousness could depend on

8

both the time since infection and the time since symptom onset, and was found to outperform

9

models in which their infectiousness depends on either one of these two times alone.

10

However, as we have demonstrated, our mechanistic approach provides an improved fit to

11

data compared to the statistical Ferretti model. In addition, our method has the advantage of

12

being useful for parameterising population-scale compartmental epidemic forecasting

13

models, since the time periods in our approach correspond naturally to compartments (29).

14
15

In summary, using a mechanistic approach to infer key epidemiological quantities from

16

transmission pair data indicates that a higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions occur

17

prior to symptoms than previously thought. Furthermore, a significant proportion of

18

transmissions arise shortly before symptom onset, indicating that contact tracing is beneficial

19

even if the contact elicitation window is short. Continued use and refinement of contact

20

tracing programmes in countries worldwide is therefore of clear public health importance.

Materials and Methods:

Notation and general details

3

Here, we outline the notation used in this section when describing the different models that

4

we considered. For a given transmission pair, we label the source as 1 and the recipient 2, and

5

define:

6

𝑡!" = (time of infection of host 𝑘),

7

𝑡#" = (time of symptom onset of host 𝑘),

8
9

𝜏!$%," = (incubation period of host 𝑘),

𝑘 = 1,2,
𝑘 = 1,2,

𝑘 = 1,2,

𝜏'($ = (generation time),

10

𝑥)*#) = (time from symptom onset of 1 to transmission to 2 (TOST)),

11

𝑥#(+ = (serial interval).

12

Here, 𝑡 is used to denote calendar times, 𝜏 for time intervals relative to the time of infection,

13

and 𝑥 for time intervals relative to the time of symptom onset. We denote the probability

14

density functions of the incubation period, generation time, TOST and serial interval as 𝑓!$% ,

15

𝑓'($ , 𝑓)*#) and 𝑓#(+ , respectively, and use a capital 𝐹 for the corresponding cumulative

16

distribution functions.

17
18

In addition, we denote the expected infectiousness of a host at time since infection 𝜏 as 𝛽(𝜏),

19

and the expected infectiousness at time since symptom onset 𝑥 as 𝑏(𝑥). Note that

20

𝛽(𝜏) = 𝑅, 𝑓'($ (𝜏),

21

𝑏(𝑥) = 𝑅, 𝑓)*#) (𝑥),

22

where 𝑅, is the basic reproduction number (for hosts that develop symptoms at some stage

23

during infection). We also let 𝛽(𝜏 ∣ 𝜏!$% ) and 𝑏(𝑥 ∣ 𝜏!$% ) be the expected infectiousness at

24

time 𝜏 since infection and at time 𝑥 since onset, respectively, conditional on an incubation

2

𝛽( 𝑥 + 𝜏!$% ∣ 𝜏!$% )).

We considered several different models for infectiousness (details of individual models are

5

given below). In each model, the conditional infectiousness, 𝛽(𝜏 ∣ 𝜏!$% ), or equivalently,

6

𝑏(𝑥 ∣ 𝜏!$% ), is specified. The distributions of the generation time and TOST can be recovered

7

from this conditional infectiousness by averaging over the incubation period distribution

8

(which is assumed to be known):
-

9

𝛽(𝜏) = 𝑅, 𝑓'($ (𝜏) = L 𝛽(𝜏 ∣ 𝜏!$% )𝑓!$% (𝜏!$% )d𝜏!$% ,
,

-

10

𝑏(𝑥) = 𝑅, 𝑓)*#) (𝑥) = L 𝑏(𝑥 ∣ 𝜏!$% )𝑓!$% (𝜏!$% )d𝜏!$% .
,

11

Alternative (equivalent) expressions for the generation time and TOST distributions are

12

available for some of the models considered (these are detailed in the “Models of

13

infectiousness” subsection below).

15
16

To obtain an expression for the serial interval distribution, we note that
𝑥#(+ = 𝑥)*#) + 𝜏!$%,. .

17

We assume throughout that 𝑥)*#) and 𝜏!$%,. are independent, so that the serial interval

18

distribution is given by the convolution

individuals who develop symptoms) can be calculated as

Data

3

Following (4), we considered COVID-19 transmission pair data from five different studies

4

(3, 9, 19–21), totalling 191 source-recipient pairs. In all 191 transmission pairs, both the

5

source and the recipient developed symptoms, and the symptom onset date of each host was

6

recorded. In four of the five studies (3, 9, 19, 20), intervals of exposure were available for

7

either the source or recipient (or both), whereas in the other (21), only symptom onset dates

8

were recorded.

10

Incubation period

11

In the main text, the incubation period was assumed to follow a Gamma distribution with

12

shape parameter 5.807 and scale parameter 0.948 (26). This corresponds to a mean

13

incubation period of 5.5 days and a standard deviation of 2.3 days. However, to demonstrate

14

that our main conclusions are robust to the exact incubation period distribution used, we also

15

repeated our analyses using an alternative, more dispersed, Gamma distributed incubation

16

period with a mean of 5.3 days and a standard deviation of 3.2 days (30) (Fig. S4).

17

Models of infectiousness

19

Independent transmission and symptoms model

20

In this model, the infectiousness of each host at a given time since infection is assumed to be

21

independent of their incubation period, so that

23
24

𝛽(𝜏 ∣ 𝜏!$% ) = 𝛽(𝜏) = 𝑅, 𝑓'($ (𝜏),
where the generation time distribution, 𝑓'($ , is prescribed. We assumed (3, 8) that
𝜏'($ ∼ Gamma(𝑎, 𝑏).

Our mechanistic model

2

In our mechanistic approach, we divided each infection into three stages: latent (E),

3

presymptomatic infectious (P), and symptomatic infectious (I). The stage durations were

4

assumed to be independent, and infectiousness was assumed to be constant over the duration

5

of each stage. We denote the stage durations by 𝑦<///= , their density and cumulative

6

distribution functions by 𝑓<///= and 𝐹<///= , and the infectiousness of hosts in the P and I

7

stages by 𝛽//= , respectively. We also define the ratio

8

𝛼 = 𝛽/ ⁄𝛽= .

9

Note that in this model, the basic reproduction number is

10

𝑅, = 𝛽/ 𝑚/ +𝛽= 𝑚= ,

11

where 𝑚//= are the respective mean durations of the P and I stages.

12
13

We further assumed that the durations of each stage followed Gamma distributions, with

14

in order to ensure a Gamma distributed incubation period,

model to data, we assumed that 𝑘= = 1, so that the symptomatic infectious period followed an

2

exponential distribution. The parameters 𝑘< and 𝜇 were estimated in the fitting procedure.

We considered two versions of the model: one in which we assumed 𝛼 = 1 (the constant

4

infectiousness model), and one in which 𝛼 was also estimated (the variable infectiousness

5

model).

For this model, the infectiousness of a host at time 𝑥 since symptom onset, conditional on an

8

incubation period of 𝜏!$% , can be calculated to be

𝐶𝑅, (1 − 𝐹= (𝑥)),

−𝜏!$% ≤ 𝑥 < 0,
𝑥 ≥ 0,

where 𝐹?()@ (𝑠; 𝑎, 𝑏) is the cumulative distribution function of a Beta distributed random

The generation time can be written as

where 𝑦 ∗ is the time between the start of the P stage and the transmission occurring, and

therefore the generation time distribution is given by the convolution

Likelihood and model fitting

5

For a single transmission pair (labelled 𝑛), suppose that the times of infection for the source

6

and recipient are known to lie in the intervals [𝑡!;,C , 𝑡!;,D ] and [𝑡!.,C , 𝑡!.,D ], respectively (where

7

these intervals may be infinite), and that their symptom onset times, 𝑡#; and 𝑡#. , are known

8

exactly. In this case, the likelihood of the parameters, 𝜃, of the model of infectiousness under

consideration (when only that transmission pair is observed) is given by

11

where the dependence of the conditional expected infectiousness, 𝑏(𝑥 ∣ 𝜏!$% , 𝜃), on the model

12

parameters, 𝜃, is indicated explicitly. A derivation of this expression is given in the

13

Supplementary Text. Assuming that each transmission pair in our dataset was independent,

14

the overall likelihood was therefore given by the product of the contributions, 𝐿($) (𝜃), from

15

each individual transmission pair, i.e.,
E

16

𝐿(𝜃) = w 𝐿($) (𝜃),
$F;

17

where 𝑁 is the total number of transmission pairs.

18
19

In order to account for uncertainty in the exact symptom onset times within the day of onset,

20

we fitted the models to the data using data augmentation MCMC. In particular, in alternating

21

steps of the chain, we updated either the vector of model parameters, 𝜃, or the symptom onset

22

times of each source and recipient. The chain was run for 2.5 million steps, of which the first

500,000 were discarded as burn-in. Posterior distributions of parameters were obtained by

recording only every 100 iterations of the chain (assuming a uniform prior distribution for

Distributions of the presymptomatic and total non-symptomatic proportion of transmissions

8

Expressions for the proportion of transmissions, 𝑞/ , generated prior to symptom onset, are

9

given for the individual models above. Once asymptomatic cases are accounted for, the

10

overall non-symptomatic proportion of transmissions can be written as
𝑝G 𝑟G + (1 − 𝑝G )𝑞/
,
𝑝G 𝑟G + (1 − 𝑝G )

11
12

where 𝑝G is the proportion of infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, and 𝑟G is the

13

ratio between the average number of secondary cases generated by an asymptomatic host and

14

the number generated by a host who at some point develops symptoms. A derivation of this

15

expression is given in the Supplementary Text.

16
17

For each model, we used the posterior parameter distributions that were obtained when we

18

fitted the model to data to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution of 𝑞/ . In order to

19

estimate the total proportion of non-symptomatic transmissions, we assumed the distributions

20

𝑝G ∼ Beta(85,186),

21

𝑟G ∼ Lognormal(−1.04, 0.65. ),

22

which are consistent with estimates in (1). These distributions are shown in Fig. S2. We then

23

combined samples from the assumed distributions of 𝑝G and 𝑟G with the sample that we

24

generated from the posterior distribution of 𝑞/ to obtain a distribution for the total proportion

25

of non-symptomatic transmissions.

Contact tracing

3

First, we considered the proportion of the infectious contacts of a symptomatic index case

4

that will be found, if contacts are traced up to 𝑑; days before the time of symptom onset (of

5

the index host). In this case, assuming that it is possible to trace a fraction 𝜀; of the host’s

6

total contacts between times −𝑑; and ∞ since symptom onset, then the proportion of

7

infectious contacts found is equal to
𝜀; (1 − 𝐹)*#) (−𝑑; )).

8
9
10

Note that we assumed that the TOST distribution for a detected index case does not differ
from that of a random infected individual.

11
12

We then considered the proportion of transmissions that can be prevented, if an infected

13

individual (identified through contact tracing) is isolated 𝑑. days after exposure. Assuming

14

that a proportion 𝜀. of infectious contacts that would otherwise occur are prevented during

15

the isolation period, the overall proportion of onward infections prevented through isolation

16

is

17

𝜀. _1 − 𝐹'($ (𝑑. )`.

18
19

In the main text, we assumed that 𝜀; = 𝜀. = 1 (i.e., contact identification and isolation are

20

both 100% effective), although values of 𝜀; and 𝜀. below 1 are considered in the

21

Supplementary Materials (Fig. S3).
