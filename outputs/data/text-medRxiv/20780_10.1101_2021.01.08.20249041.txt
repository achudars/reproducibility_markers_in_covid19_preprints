Abstract
Rationale. Triage is crucial for patient’s management and estimation of the required Intensive Care
Unit (ICU) beds is fundamental for Health Systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Objective. To assess whether chest Computed Tomography (CT) of COVID-19 pneumonia has an
incremental role in predicting patient’s admission to ICU.
Methods. We performed volumetric and texture analysis of the areas of the affected lung in CT of
115 outpatients with COVID-19 infection presenting to the Emergency Room with dyspnea and
unresponsive hypoxyemia. Admission blood laboratory including lymphocyte count, serum lactate
dehydrogenase, D-dimer and C-Reactive Protein and the ratio between the arterial partial pressure
of oxygen and inspired oxygen were collected. By calculating the areas under the receiver-operating
characteristic curves (AUC), we compared the performance of blood laboratory-arterial gas
analyses features alone and combined with the CT features in two hybrid models (Hybrid
radiological and Hybrid radiomics)for predicting ICU admission. Following a machine learning
approach, 63 patients were allocated to the training and 52 to the validation set.
Measurements and Main Results. Twenty-nine (25%) of patients were admitted to ICU. The Hybrid
radiological model comprising the lung %consolidation performed significantly (p=0.04) better in
predicting ICU admission in the validation (AUC=0.82; 95%Confidence Interval 0.68-0.95) set
than the blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses features alone (AUC=0.71; 95%Confidence Interval
0.56-0.86). A risk calculator for ICU admission was derived and is available
at:https://github.com/cgplab/covidapp
Conclusions. The volume of the consolidated lung in CT of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
has a mild but significant incremental value in predicting ICU admission.

Introduction
In January 2020 the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a public health emergency
of international concern. Until December 2020 it has caused more than 80 million of cases and
more than 1.7 million of deaths worldwide (1).
About 15% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia show a severe disease course requiring
hospitalization and 5% eventual admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (2,3).
Prediction of ICU admission is crucial for patient’s management and forecasting the required
number of ICU beds is fundamental for the resources allocation and organization of the health
systems during the COVID-19 pandemic (4). Hence prediction of ICU admission has been
frequently investigated in studies addressing diagnostic and prognostic models for COVID-19 (5).
Among the variables potentially useful for such a purpose, clinical features yielded mixed results
(6-12), while blood laboratory and arterial gas analysis features generally improved the overall
prediction capacity (8,10,11,13-16).
Due to the non-specificity of findings, chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) have no
diagnostic role in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (17,18). Moreover the American College of
Radiology and Society of Thoracic Radiology in the United States cautioned against their
widespread use for assessment and monitoring disease course (18). However several studies in Asia,
Europe and United States have indicated that chest radiographs and CT may have a role in the
prediction of clinical evolution including need of ICU admission (19-25).
We hypothesized that CT-based quantitative analysis of the volume of the affected lung and
its characterization in terms of texture analysis (26) might have an incremental role with respect to
blood laboratory and arterial gas analysis results in predicting the patient’s admission to ICU. To
explore this hypothesis following a machine learning approach we compared the predictive value of
blood laboratory and arterial gas analysis features alone with those of two hyrbid models
combining the same features with those derived from CT.

Methods
The study received ethical approval (Protocol Number: 17260_oss) on May 19, 2020 by The Ethical
Committee for Clinical Studies of the Central Tuscany Region. The study was performed between
March 7th and November 8th 2020 at the Prato and Pistoia community hospitals in the Tuscany
region of Italy, where overall 3-12% of hospital beds were allocated to ICUs in the study time
period.
The study involved 208 outpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive nucleic acid
test of real time-PCR in nasal-pharingeal swabs who presented to the Emergency Room (ER) and
underwent immediate unenhanced chest CT because of dyspnea and non-responsive hypoxiemia.
Laboratory data on admission included routine blood tests, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Ddimer and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and lymphocytes count. Moreover in each patient the
Horowitz (P/F) Index was calculated as the ratio between the arterial partial pressure of oxygen
[PaO2] measured (in mmHg) by blood gas analysis and fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2].
Patient’s age and gender and co-morbidities including history of arterial hypertension, diabetes,
heart diseases and malignancies were annotated. Subsequent admission to the ICU and patient’s
death were recorded as of November 13th, 2020.
Patients with CT images of low quality or incomplete blood laboratory or arterial blood gas
analyses were excluded. Accordingly, data were analyzed in 115 of the initial 208 patients.
Following a machine-learning approach and to avoid a “peeking” effect (27,28), 63 patients
observed between March 7th and April 21st, 2020 during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in
Italy constituted the training set and 52 patients observed between August 18th and November 8th
2020 during the second wave constituted the validation set. Fig 1. shows the study flow-chart.
The chest CT examinations were performed in Prato (n=88) on a Siemens SOMATOM Sensation
(Germany) 64-rows of detectors scanner or in Pistoia (n=27)on an Optima CT660 GE Medical
System (USA) 16-rows of detectors scanner. The patients were examined in supine position during
inspiratory breath-hold or spontaneous breathing. CT acquisition parameters are detailed in an

online data supplement. The CT images were transferred to a workstation implemented with the
MIM Maestro software (MIM Software Inc.). Three Regions of Interest (RoIs) were automatically
created from both lungs: Well-Areated Lung (WAL), which comprises the entire healthy tissue,
Ground Glass Opacities (GGO), which includes areas showing ground glass density, and
Consolidation (Consolid), which corresponds to areas of consolidated tissue. For segmentation of
WAL and GGO, we used the Region Growing tool and threshold intervals were set from -950
Hounsfield Units(HU) to -700HU for WAL (21) and from -700HU to -250HU for GGO (29). For
ConsolidRoI, a single expert radiologist with 20 years of experience in lung CT (M.B.) blind to the
patient's clinical, blood laboratory and arterial gas analyses results performed a manual editing of
the segmentation results. An example is shown in Supplementary figure 1. The fraction of each RoI
with respect to total lung volume was calculated. For image texture analysis, 107 radiomic features
listed in Supplementary material table 1 were extracted using the 3DSlicer software (30) and the
module radiomic (31). Image texture features were processed and analyzed by RadAR (Radiomics
Analysis with R) (32). Features with duplicated ids and shape features (n=21) were excluded from
downstream analysis.
Statistical Analysis and Model Construction
We used two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to assess statistical significance of the differences
between the ICU and non-ICU patients groups for parametric variables and Fisher’s Exact test for
age and gender. Since co-morbidities can determine distortions in the admission to the ICU,
especially when there is a relative shortage of dedicated beds, they were not included in the models.
Models to predict ICU admission were built using binomial regression with GLMNET (33) on
continuous variables, considering ICU admission as response variable (0=no, 1=yes). We
selected GLMNET because, differently from other methods as multivariate random forest, it
enables simultaneous selection of relevant features and parameter estimation. We built 5 models
using age, blood laboratory features, the P/F ratio, the radiological and the radiomics features. The
description of each feature is reported in Supplementary Table 1. To select relevant features for each

model (feature selection), predictors showing nonzero coefficient at lambda.min - corresponding to
the value of the regularization parameter lambda that gives minimum mean cross-validated error were considered. To facilitate the applicability of our approach, GLMNET models were then rebuilt
considering only model-specific selected features.
The performance of each model was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curves (AUC) in the training and validation sets, using model probability as threshold
parameter. All the analyses were performed using the R statistical programming language
(https://cran.r-project.org/).
The confidence intervals of AUCs and the statistical significance of pairwise difference between
AUCs were estimated by De Long’s tests implemented in the pROC R package (34).
Web application
An interactive web application implementing the three best performing models (see below) was
built using Shiny (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny).

Results
Twenty-nine (19 of the training and10 of validation set) of the 115 included patients were admitted
to ICU. The average interval between ER presentation and ICU admission was 1.9 days (range 122) in the training and 2.6 (range 1-5) in the validation set.
Table 1 details the distribution of age, gender, number of co-morbidities, blood laboratory and
arterial gas analyses results and of those of the CT in the patients of the training and validation sets.
In both sets the P/F index and %WAL were significantly lower and the %Consolid significantly
higher in patients admitted to ICU. Comparing the data in the training and validation sets, only
LDH was significantly higher (p=0.004) and the age lower (p=0.01) in the patients of the validation
set who were not admitted to ICU.
Table 2 summarizes the considered features and those selected by the GLMNET. Age, LDH and the
P/F ratio were selected as the best features both in the blood laboratory and arterial gas analyses

model and in the Hybrid radiological model which also comprised %consolid. The Hybrid
radiomics model comprised the P/F ratio, LDH, %consolid and 3 of the 86 considered texture
features (see table 1 and supplementary table 1).
Fig. 2 shows the AUC of the model based on blood laboratory and arterial gas analyses features
alone and of the two Hybrid models. The Hybrid radiological model performed better in predicting
admission to the ICU in both the training (AUC=0.87; 95%Confidence Interval 0.77-0.97) and
validation (AUC=0.86; 95%Confidence Interval 0.73-0.97) set as compared to the blood laboratoryarterial blood gas analyses features alone (training AUC=0.82; 95%Confidence Interval 0.68-0.95)
(validation AUC=0.71; 95%Confidence Interval 0.56-0.86). The difference was significant (p=0.04)
in the validation set. Also the Hybrid radiomics model performed better than the blood laboratoryarterial blood gas analyses features alone in the two sets, but the differences were not significant.
The models evaluating radiological and radiomics features alone selected two (%consolid and
%WAL) and seven features(see supplementary table 1), respectively, but performed worse than the
model evaluating blood laboratory and arterial gas analyses results in predicting ICU admission (see
supplementary Fig. 2).
The distribution of the probability of ICU admission in the validation set (Supplementary Fig.3)
indicates that no patient required ICU admission below the threshold of 0.25, 0.15 and 0.05 for the
blood laboratory-arterial gas analyses model, Hybrid radiological and Hybrid radiomic models,
respectively. In particular, in the Hybrid radiological model all patients with estimated probability
below 0.20, corresponding to 16 (30%) of 52 patients, were all correctly classified and identified as
a low-risk population without need of ICU admission.
The application to estimate the patient’s probability of ICU admission with the three best
performing models is freely available at https://github.com/cgplab/covidapp under MIT license
and allows users using the proposed models after insertion of the required model-specific features.
Mortality rates were 14% (9/63) in the training and 21% (11/52) in the validation set.

Discussion

Admission to ICU, where the most invasive and sophisticated treatments are carried out, is
associated with a number of variables, including the evaluation of the patient’s clinical severity and
evolution and the availability of ICU beds, but generally implies a severe structural and functional
lung compromise, worse prognosis and increasing costs.
In this study we holistically combined blood laboratory, arterial gas analyses and CT results
at ER presentation to predict ICU admission in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We
demonstrated that the Hybrid radiological model combining CT estimation of volume of the
consolidated lung with blood laboratory and arterial gas analyses features has a mild but significant
incremental predictive value with respect to the model considering blood laboratory and arterial gas
analyses features alone. This result is in line with and reinforces data from prior studies which
evaluated the contribute of CT in predicting ICU admission in hybrid models (21,23-25).
For comparison with CT we considered several established blood biomarkers of severity of
COVID-19 pneumonia including serum LDH, D-dimer, CRP and lymphocyte counts that can
predict ICU admission (10,12,13,15,16,23). As well, we considered the P/F ratio which is a marker
of non-responsive hypoxiemia in these patients (10,14,16).
Notably, in both our hybrid models the volume of consolidated lung, that is correlated with lung
weight, was the best radiological biomarker instead than the volume of the well areated lung, that is
the CT biomarker commonly used for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
(21,35,36).This is in line on the one hand with the observation that the pathological and radiological
features of COVID-19 pneumonia are not typical of ARDS. In fact COVID-19 pneumonia along
with diffuse alveolar damage and organizing pneumonia is characterized by a prominent vascular
compromise justifying the observed disproportionate and non-responsive hypoxyemia (37,38) and
the term “CARDS” (COVID-19 ARDS) (39) to label it. Moreover, according to Gattinoni et al.
(40) consolidation and its extent characterizes two phenotypes of CARDS named type L (Low
elastance, Low ventilation-to perfusion ratio, Low lung weight and Low recruitability) and type H

(High elastance, High ventilation-to perfusion ratio, High lung weight and High recruitability)
“which are best identified by CT”, involve different pathophysiological mechanisms and require
different treatment options that, in case of type H, include intubation, positive end-expiratory
pressure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation that pertain to the ICU environment.
In our study, the Hybrid radiomics model including image texture features of the affected
lung slightly (and not significantly) improved prediction of ICU admission as compared with blood
laboratory and arterial gas analyses features, but performed worse than the Hybrid radiological
model. Two prior studies reported a marginal incremental value of Radiomics for prediction of ICU
admission as compared to volume estimation of the affected lung (24,25). Notably, since the Hybrid
radiomics was the best performing model in our training set, but showed mild and non-significant
advantage compared to blood laboratory and arterial gas features in the validation set, we speculate
that Hybrid radiomics models might be more affected by overfitting as compared to the Hybrid
radiological model. Overall, also considering that the pathological correlates of the CT texture
features analysis are uncertain (26), we recommend estimation of the volume of lung consolidation
and the Hybrid radiological model for triage of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
We recognize the following limitations of our study.
We performed a single centre study and assessment of the proposed models with data from other
centres are required to verify their external validity. In our models we considered a large array of
continuous variables in different domains, including D-dimer and P/F ratio which reflect the more
characteristic physiopathological features of COVID-19 pneumonia(14,15,41) and are associated
with worst prognosis (42), but discarded some potentially relevant categorical variables as gender,
obesity and co-morbidities (43,44) which however are more closely linked with mortality than ICU
admission. Moreover the recently described ABO blood-group system and genetic susceptibility
loci (45) and some continuous variables as serum Interleukin-6 (23,46), ferritin and procalcitonin
(16) were not available. Finally, we did not evaluate death as an outcome due to the small samples.

However this would imply to consider treatments and other variables and was beyond the scope of
the present investigation.
In conclusion, the combination of the volume of lung consolidation on CT at ER
presentation has a mild but significant incremental value as compared to blood laboratory and
arterial gas analyses results in predicting ICU admission. Inclusion of CT in the triage of patients
with symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia may have a practical value for individual patient’s
management (possibly using the free application we developed) and help planning and organizing
the Health Systems response to COVID-19 pandemic.

On line repository material
CT scanning parameters
They were set as follows: tube voltage 120 kV, tube current modulation from CareDose4D
technology with quality reference mAs 150, pitch 1.4, slice thickness 0.6 mm in the Siemens
scanner and tube voltage 120 kV, tube current modulation Smart mA technology, pitch 1.0, slice
thickness 0.6 mm, in the GE scanner. Reconstruction filter used was B30 medium smooth for both
the scanners and reconstruction was performed with slice thickness ranging from 2.5 and 3 mm in
order to allow segmentation software to manage the amount of data in an appropriate time frame.
