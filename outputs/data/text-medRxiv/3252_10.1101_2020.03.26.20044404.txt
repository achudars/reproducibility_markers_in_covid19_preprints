Clear plastic drapes may be effective at limiting aerosolization and droplet spray during
extubation: implications for COVID-19

To the Editor,
Health care providers (HCPs) performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP) in
patients with the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, are considered to be at higher risk for
contracting the disease.1 Reports on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in
concerns over increased risk for infection, especially with global shortages of personal protection
equipment (PPE) needed for droplet precautions.2 Contamination of surfaces and personnel with
virus-loaded droplets may occur during high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures
(AGMP), such as intubation and extubation. A recent report recommended the use of gauze
around the patient’s mouth as a method for reducing the aerosolization of the virus.1 Our group
performed a series of experiments assessing whether clear plastic drapes were effective in
containing aerosolization during extubation. These experiments did not require institutional
research ethics approval.
All experiments utilized Glo-germ™ (Glo Germ Company, Moab, UT, USA), a
fluorescent resin powder with particle sizes between 1-5 µm (SARS-COV-2 is 0.07-1.2 µm),
with ultraviolet light detection in a darkened operating room. A pediatric manikin (Eletripod
ET/J10 Tracheal Intubation model, Tuqi, China) was used wherein simulated secretions (0.5 mL
of Glo-germ) were applied to the oropharynx and the mid-trachea of the manikin. A cough was
simulated using a calibrated medical air gun connected to the distal trachea, fired over 0.4 sec,
delivering cough peak expiratory flow rates (CPEFR) of 150-180 L·min-1 outward from the

trachea. The normal CPEFR ranges from 87 L·min-1 in children under one year, to 728 L·min-1
in some adults; a CPEFR < 175 L·min-1 is predictive of failure to extubate in adults.3-5 Between
experiments, the manikin was cleaned with alcohol, soap and water. All experiments were video
recorded (240 fps) using a combination of GoPro Hero 6 (GoPro Inc, San Mateo, CA, USA),
iPhone X, X Max, and XR (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA).
In the first series of experiments (Exp), we simulated a cough during extubation of the
manikin both without (Exp 1A) and with (Exp 1B) a single clear plastic drape applied over the
head and endotracheal tube. We then repeated the same extubation cough sequence in a second
series of experiments (Exp 2) using a modified three-layer plastic drape configuration. The first
layer was placed under the head of the manikin to protect the operating table and linen. The
second torso-drape layer was applied from the neck down and over the chest, preventing
contamination of the upper torso. The final over-head top drape was a clear plastic drape with a
sticky edge that was secured at the mid sternum level. It was draped over the patient’s head to
prevent contamination of the surrounding surfaces, including the HCPs. After the cough was
complete, the top two drapes were rolled away together toward the patient’s legs, to contain and
remove the contaminant and the third drape removed afterward.
A cough without any plastic drapes applied (Exp 1A) resulted in a wide distribution of
droplets contaminating the surrounding areas (Figure A and eVideo in the Electronic
Supplementary Material [ESM]).A The use of a single clear plastic drape (Exp 1B) restricted the
aerosolization and droplet spraying of the particles, but using the three-drape technique (Exp 2)
resulted in significant further reduction in contamination of the immediate area surrounding the
patient (Figure B; eVideo in the ESM). An area of significant contamination, a “hot-zone” was
noted on the drape covering the bed beneath the mannequin head (Figure C). The patient’s face

and head were also contaminated (Figure C). However, we were able to successfully remove
these drapes (by rolling them up) without further contamination of the area or the HCP. This was
evidenced by the lack of fluorescent particles on visual inspection.
Our series of experiments (each performed once) were proof-of-concept on the patterns
of aerosolization and droplet sprays during extubation and the impact of clear drapes. We were to
demonstrate that the use of low-cost barriers (clear plastic drapes) were able to significantly limit
the aerosolization and droplet spray. Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is
a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The
inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation)
of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as
an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical
procedures that may be AGMPs. Limitations of this work include its low-fidelity design and use
of a larger particle (Glo-Germ) that may not reflect true spread of a virus like SARS-CoV-2. It is
particularly important that HCPs take care not generate further aerosols during removal of the
drapes; and recommend using the three-panel draping as opposed to the single drape technique.
Further studies will be needed to further refine this model and its findings.
