Abstract
Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread
as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social
and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety
regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps and sources of
misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more
focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level
among the general public residing in Jordan. An online survey was used that targeted
people aged 18 and above and residing in Jordan. The questionnaire included items
on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about
COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic.
The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study
population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The
overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, male gender, lower
monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were
associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that
were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower
monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and
history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a
conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with
higher anxiety and lower knowledge about the disease. Social media platforms, TV
and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic.
The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general
public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate
information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact
of the disease.

Introduction
The entire world is facing an unprecedented challenge in the form of the most recent
pandemic caused by severe acute coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in a massive number of infections throughout the
world with a higher mortality rate among high risk groups (elderly, those with
comorbidities) [2]. The public is left in a state of disarray due to the socio-economic
consequences of the pandemic [3-5]. This global phenomenon dominated the media
and became part of everyday conversation [6,7]. The emergence of this virus led to a
worldwide lockdown, army enforced rules, disruption of education and a shift in the
global economy [4]. These events caused public apprehension that raised questions
and spread rumors, which demonstrates the significance of providing correct
knowledge and reliable information for proper management of this public health
emergency [5,8].
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vary, but commonly include: fever, cough,
shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhea [9-11]. The virus is primarily transmitted
via respiratory droplets and close contact with an infected person [11]. SARS-CoV-2
can remain active for hours and even days on surfaces, therefore, touching infected
surfaces can lead to the spread of infection [12,13]. This is why frequent hand washing
and social distancing are the ideal protective measures [14]. To date, there are limited
therapeutic options and no vaccine available for COVID-19 infection, and
management hinges on supportive therapy [15].
Conspiracy theories regarding the origins of COVID-19 might be a way for the public
to make sense of this pandemic. However, dangerous speculations about the virus
might diminish the efforts in controlling the spread of infection [8,16]. Thus, it is
important to assess the misconceptions and misbeliefs among the public which can
reveal defects that should be targeted by awareness tools [17].
The potential negative effects of COVID-19 misinformation have been the subject of
active research since the onset of the pandemic [8,18-22]. Our previous investigation
of this topic entailed students at the University of Jordan (UJ) with results pointed to

an association between the belief in conspiracy regarding the origin of the virus and a
lower COVID-19 knowledge accompanied with higher anxiety level [23].
Deciphering the level of knowledge and attitude toward this unprecedented
pandemic can help in identifying the current gaps in knowledge about COVID-19.
Resources must be utilized to bridge this gap and promote proper knowledge about
COVID-19, which in turn will help in disease control. This project aimed to explore
the repercussions of misinformation regarding conspiracy beliefs about this
pandemic. Thus, the objectives of the current study were: (1) to assess the overall
COVID-19 knowledge and attitude among the general public residing in Jordan, (2)
to evaluate the effects of misinformation regarding COVID-19 origins on the anxiety
level, and (3) to assess the main sources of knowledge regarding the disease in the
country.

Methods
Study design
This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that
took place between April 11, 2020 (21:00) to April 14, 2020 (00:00), thus spanning 75
hours and targeting residents in Jordan aged 18 years and above. Participation in the
study was voluntary and an informed consent was included. The questionnaire was
sent through Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and other social media platforms. The
questionnaire comprised six sections with a total of 39 items addressing various
subjects regarding knowledge, attitude, misinformation, sources of knowledge, and
anxiety of participants regarding COVID-19. The language used to conduct the survey
was Arabic (S1 Appendix).
The questionnaire contained items on socio-demographic information (age,
nationality, gender, governorate of residence, marital status, monthly family income,
educational level, history of smoking, and the presence of any chronic disease). Four
items were used to assess the attitude towards the quarantine period (perception of
the danger of the disease, adherence to quarantine measures, spending quality time
with the family, and annoyance by the inability to attend religious houses of worship).
Two items were used to assess the sources of information, and three items were
included to determine the role of conspiracy theories, biological warfare, and 5G
networks in the origin and the spread of the pandemic. An additional item was also
included to examine the belief in a divine role in the origin of the disease (S1
Appendix).
Ethical permission
The study was approved by the Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Forensic
Medicine and by the Scientific Research Committee at the School of Medicine/UJ,
(using WhatsApp conference call) which was later registered under the reference
number 2479/2020/67 at the School of Medicine/UJ. Participation in the study was
voluntary and anonymous. An informed consent was ensured by the presence of an

introductory section of the questionnaire, with submission of responses implying the
agreement to participate. All collected data were treated confidentially.

COVID-19 knowledge score (K-score) calculation
Thirteen items were used to assess the overall COVID-19 knowledge among the study
participants. These items included knowledge of symptoms of the disease (fever,
cough, vomiting and diarrhea, and shortness of breath), knowledge of virus
transmission (touching infected surfaces, close contact with an infected person, and
transmission via blood), infectivity of the virus on surfaces for long periods of time,
use of antibiotics for treating the disease, availability of a vaccine, remedial effect of
garlic, onion and ginger on the infection, ability of summer heat to inactivate the virus,
and possibility of reinfection by the virus (S1 Appendix). Each correct answer was
recorded as a single point and a valid K-score was considered upon having responses
to all 13 items.
Assessment of the anxiety score
The final section of seven items was used to measure the level of anxiety during the
government-enforced quarantine period using the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) scale [24]. This scale is a reliable method for anxiety assessment and included four
possible responses to each item. A valid anxiety score was considered upon having
responses to all seven items. The maximum possible anxiety score was 21 with the
minimum being zero.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS v22.0 for Windows. Significance
was considered for P-values <0.050. Chi-squared (œá2), Mann-Whitney U (M-W) and
Kruskal Wallis (K-W) tests were used as appropriate.

Results
Characteristics of the study population
The total number of individuals who participated in the survey and that were
included in final analysis was 3150 after filtering out responses from those who were
less than 18 years old. This resulted in 1.75% margin of error considering the 95%
confidence interval and the current total population of Jordan (10,184,790 people)
[25,26]. General features of the study participants are summarized in (Table 1). The
median age of the study participants was 27 (mean: 31, interquartile range: 22-37).
Females dominated the study population (n=2358, 76.0% with 47 cases of nonresponse), and residents of the Central region of Jordan represented 84.1% of the
participants (with 78 cases of non-response). For educational level and monthly
income, the majority of study participants had an undergraduate degree (diploma or
bachelor‚Äôs degrees) representing 73.6% and the majority had a monthly income of less
than 1000 JODs (n=2413, 78.3%, Table 1).

COVID-19 knowledge
The overall knowledge of the study participants regarding COVID-19 is illustrated in
(Figure 1). The majority of the study participants correctly responded to eleven out of
the thirteen items, with the least percentage of correct responses observed in the
following two items: the virus can remain active on surfaces for few hours (49.7%) and
reinfection by COVID-19 is not possible (23.7%, Figure 1).

assessing COVID-19 knowledge.

All items were shown as correct statements. COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019, SARSCoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

The total number of participants who had a valid K-score was 2988, with a mean Kscore of 10.2 (range: 1.0-13.0). Higher level of knowledge regarding COVID-19 was
seen among residents of Amman (mean K-score 10.3 vs. 10.1, p=0.003; M-W),
participants with higher income (10.5 vs. 10.2 vs. 10.0, p<0.001; K-W), participants
with higher educational level (10.6 vs. 10.2 vs. 9.8, p<0.001; K-W) and among nonsmokers (10.2 vs. 10.0, p=0.016, M-W; Figure 2).

In addition, participants who felt annoyed by the inability to attend places of worship
displayed a lower mean K-score (10.1 vs. 10.4, p<0.001; M-W). For the survey items
related to COVID-19 misinformation, the participants who believed that the pandemic
is related to a conspiracy and those who believed that it was part of a biologic warfare
had lower mean K-score (10.0 vs. 10.4, p<0.001 for both comparisons; M-W). In
addition, those who believed in the role of 5G networks in COVID-19 spread had a
lower mean K-score (9.8 vs. 10.3, p<0.001; M-W). Moreover, those who believed that

Anxiety regarding COVID-19
The total number of participants who had a valid anxiety score was 3035, with mean
score of 9.2 (range: zero-21.0). Variables with significant association to higher anxiety
level were female gender (mean anxiety score: 9.3 vs 8.7, p=0.007, M-W), residence
outside Amman (9.5 vs. 9.0, p=0.006; M-W), lower educational level (10.1 vs. 9.1 vs.
8.5, p<0.001; K-W), lower monthly income (9.9 vs. 9.0 vs. 8.3, p<0.001; K-W), and
smoking (9.9 vs. 9.0, p<0.001; M-W, Figure 4). In addition, those who felt annoyed by
the inability to attend places of worship had a higher mean anxiety score (9.7 vs. 8.2,
p<0.001; M-W). While those who thought that the quarantine gave them an
opportunity to spend a quality time with their families had a lower mean anxiety score
(8.9 vs. 10.8, p<0.001; M-W). Higher anxiety scores were found among those who
believed that COVID-19 is related to conspiracy (9.7 vs. 8.7; p<0.001; M-W), biological
warfare believers (9.6 vs. 8.6, p<0.001; M-W), those who believed in the role of 5G
networks in facilitating COVID-19 spread (10.3 vs. 8.9, p<0.001; M-W), and those who

Perception of COVID-19 danger and attitude towards quarantine
The majority of study population felt that the disease is moderately dangerous
(n=1896, 60.3%), followed by 1152 participants who perceived the disease as very
dangerous (36.6%). Older participants (more than or equal to 27 [the median age of
the whole study population]) perceived the disease as very dangerous (40.6%
compared to 31.7%) among the younger participants (less than 27 years old, p<0.001;
œá2, Table 2). Males were more likely to perceive the disease as very dangerous
compared to females (41.2% vs. 35.2%, p=0.001; œá2). Participants with the lowest
monthly income were more inclined to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous (41.0%
vs. 34.5% vs. 32.5%, p=0.002; œá2). Also, those with the lowest educational level were
more likely to believe that the disease is very dangerous (44.0% vs. 34.8% vs. 38.1%,
p=0.001; œá2). Smokers (42.8% vs. 34.6%) and those with history of chronic disease
(48.2% vs. 35.5%) had higher likelihood to perceive COVID-19 as a very dangerous
disease (p<0.001 for both comparisons; œá2). Those who believed that the current
pandemic was a spiritual test were more likely to perceive the disease as very
dangerous (38.0% vs. 29.8%, p=0.001; œá2). Married participants were more likely to feel
that COVID-19 is very dangerous compared to single participants (40.6% vs. 32.5%,
p<0.001; œá2, Table 2). The vast majority of study participants reported adhering to the
quarantine measures (n=3072, 97.9%). Variables that were associated with higher
likelihood to break the quarantine measures included male gender (4.3% vs. 1.3%,
p<0.001; œá2) and history of smoking (3.7% vs. 1.4%, p<0.001; œá2).

Beliefs and misinformation about COVID-19 origin
1. Is COVID-19 part of a global conspiracy?
Overall, a total of 1501 of the study participants believed that COVID-19 is part of a
global conspiracy (47.9%, Figure 6). This belief was more common among females
compared to males (50.1% vs. 41.2%, p<0.001; œá2), among married participants
compared to single participants (50.5% vs. 45.8%, p=0.011; œá2) and among smokers
compared to non-smokers (52.8% vs. 46.3%, p=0.001; œá2). The gradual increase in
monthly income was associated with a gradual decrease in the belief that COVID-19
is part of a global conspiracy (50.5% in those with income of <500 JOD vs. 48.2% in
those with income of 500-1000 JOD vs. 43.8% among those with income of >1000 JOD,
p=0.019; œá2). For educational level, the belief in conspiracy was the highest among

those with a lower educational level (50.4% among those with high school or less
degree vs. 48.5% among those with an undergraduate degree, vs. 40.8% among those
with postgraduate degrees, p=0.016; œá2).

2. Is COVID-19 part of a biological warfare?
The majority of study participants had a belief that SARS-CoV-2 origin was related to
biological warfare (n=1778, 57.0%, Figure 6). This belief was more common among
females (59.7% vs. 48.6%, p<0.001; œá2), married participants (59.2% vs. 55.0%, p=0.023;
œá2), participants with low and middle income (p=0.001; œá2), and lower educational
level (p=0.002; œá2).
3. Do 5G networks have a role in COVID-19 spread?
The overall belief in 5G networks role in the spread of COVID-19 was generally less
compared to the previously mentioned items (conspiracy and biological warfare)
(n=641, 21.0%, Figure 6). This misbelief was higher among females (23.6% vs. 12.8% in

males, p<0.001; œá2), married participants (23.1% vs. 19.4% among singles, p=0.017; œá2),
lower monthly income (24.2%, vs. 20.9% vs. 15.9%, p<0.001; œá2), and lower educational
level (28.0% vs. 20.4% vs. 15.5%, p<0.001; œá2).
4. Is COVID-19 a spiritual divine test or trial?
The majority of study participants stated that COVID-19 pandemic is a divine spiritual
test (n=2595, 82.7%). Variables associated with such a belief included female gender
(85.0% vs. 75.8%, p<0.001; œá2), Jordanian nationality (83.3% vs. 77.1% among nonJordanians, p=0.019; œá2), residence outside Amman (86.5% vs. 80.1% among those in
Amman, p<0.001; œá2), marriage (86.5% vs. 79.3, p<0.001; œá2), lower educational level
(88.2%, vs. 82.9% vs. 73.5%, p<0.001; œá2), lower monthly income (88.4% vs. 82.9% vs.
71.6%, p<0.001; œá2), and non-smoking (84.2% vs. 78.5%, p<0.001; œá2).
The main media and other sources of information about the pandemic
The most common source of information for study participants regarding the
pandemic were social media platforms (n=1075, 34.4%), followed by TV and news
releases (n=850, 27.2%), the official Ministry of Health website on COVID-19 (n=771,
24.6%) and finally scientific journals and opinion of medical doctors (n=432, 13.8%).
For social media platforms, Facebook predominated as the main source of information
about the pandemic (81.1%), followed by WhatsApp (7.0%), YouTube (4.6%), Twitter
(4.5%) and Instagram (2.9%).
The participants who relied on TV and news releases as the main source of knowledge
about the virus were older in age compared to those who used other sources combined
(33 vs. 30 years old, p<0.001; M-W). Those who relied on doctors and scientific journals
had a higher mean K-score (10.5 vs. 10.1, p<0.001; M-W) and a lower mean anxiety
score (8.1 vs. 9.3, p<0.001; M-W, Figure 7).

Participants who depended on medical doctors and scientific journals as their main
source of information about COVID-19 were less predisposed to believe in conspiracy
(38.4% vs. 49.3%, p<0.001; œá2), and its related misinformation (5G networks role: 14.2%
vs. 22.0%, p<0.001; œá2, biological warfare role: 47.7% vs. 58.3%, p<0.001; œá2 and belief
that the pandemic is a spiritual test: 69.1% vs. 48.9%, p<0.001; œá2). They were also less
prone to feel that the disease is very dangerous (30.6% vs. 37.6%, p<0.001; œá2). Higher
reliance on information provided by scientific journals and medical doctors was seen
among males (18.8% vs. 12.4%, p<0.001; œá2), participants with a higher educational
level (25.7% vs. 14.0% vs. 4.9%, p<0.001; œá2), participants with a higher monthly
income (21.4% vs. 13.7% vs. 9.6%, p<0.001), residence in Amman (15.2% vs. 12.0%,
p=0.012; œá2), non-Jordanian nationality (19.9% vs. 13.4%, p=0.007) and single marital
status (17.0% vs. 10.4%, p<0.001; œá2).

Discussion
The key results of this study can be summarized as follows: the overall knowledge of
COVID-19 among residents in Jordan was satisfactory. More than 87% correct
responses were found for eight items and more than 63% correct responses for eleven
items out of thirteen total items that were used to assess COVID-19 knowledge in this
study. The participants scored less for two items: SARS-CoV-2 can remain active on
surfaces for few days rather than few hours (50%) and re-infection by COVID-19 is not
possible (24%). The lower knowledge in relation to these two items can be attributed
to ongoing research that has not achieved a widespread outreach for the public yet.
Such research indicated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces for more than 24
hours depending on the nature of the surface [13,27]. For the possibility of re-infection,
the current evidence points to unlikely occurrence of such a phenomenon despite the
need for more research tackling this aim [28-31].
The high overall knowledge might be attributed to general interest of the public in
this pandemic that became a global phenomenon and such high knowledge has been
reported recently by several studies around the globe [32-37]. However, upon further
dissecting COVID-19 knowledge, in relation to possible origins of the pandemic,
severe gaps in knowledge were revealed. This was manifested by high prevalence of
belief in conspiracy (48%), biologic warfare role (57%) and 5G networks‚Äô role (21%) in
the origin and spread of the virus. In our previous work among university students,
we found a significant association between higher anxiety during the current
pandemic and the belief in conspiracy in COVID-19 origin [23]. The results of the
current study clearly delineate the existence of an association between misinformation
about COVID-19 and the combination of higher anxiety and lower knowledge about
the disease among the public in Jordan.
Even though the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 was scientifically determined to a large
extent, which further discredits the role of a conspiracy in the origin of the disease,
many people still grasp to such delusions [38,39]. The current climate of fear and
uncertainty seems as a fertile soil from which conspiracy beliefs are born and thrive
[40,41]. Thus, the high prevalence of inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 origins seems

a plausible result. In addition, the link that was demonstrated between higher anxiety
levels and conspiracy belief in this study, is not unique and can augment the previous
evidence that such belief is harmful [23,42,43].
The clearest variable associated with lower overall knowledge about the disease, belief
in conspiracy and higher anxiety level was the lower socio-economic status (lower
educational level and lower monthly income). This result is consistent with findings
from various recent studies, and points to the importance of targeting such groups
with intensified awareness campaigns [33,34,44-46].
The most common main source of information about COVID-19 reported by the
participants were the social media platforms. The role of social media in fueling and
spreading implausible notions cannot be overlooked [47-49]. The spread of such
misinformation via social media outlets is not a recent phenomenon that accompanied
the current crisis, but also involved several health-related aspects (e.g. vaccination,
AIDS denialism, Zika fever outbreak, etc.) in the last decade [49-51]. To fight against
the spread of harmful misinformation, the correct public health messages should be
delivered in a user-friendly style with emphasis on fact-checking tools [52]. The prime
role relies on experts, physicians and the policy makers to advocate for social media
campaigns that can aid in establishing a culture of fact-checking [53].
Regarding the anxiety level of the study participants and taking into account that the
survey was conducted in April 2020, the overall mean anxiety score showed a mild
anxiety among the study participants. Females showed a higher anxiety level
compared to males and this can be partly explained by the differences in physiology
which increase females‚Äô susceptibility to develop anxiety and stress [54,55]. Also, the
lower socio-economic status was associated with a higher anxiety level which can be
attributed to the lack of income security during the crisis. Moreover, participants
living outside Amman had higher anxiety; this might be due to certain hardships
accompanying inhabitants of rural areas and more isolated areas, like financial strains
and social isolation. Such results are in line with recent research pointing to similar
associations [7,34,56-58]. Furthermore, smokers had higher mean anxiety score
compared to non-smokers; this is because of the rising emphasis on how smokers are

more vulnerable to infections including COVID-19, besides the worsened prognosis
in case of protracting the disease [59,60].
For the perception of COVID-19 degree of threat, males, participants with a lower
socio-economic status, smokers and those with a history of chronic disease were likely
to perceive the disease as very dangerous. This result appears plausible, particularly
for individuals with comorbidities, considering the high-risk of severe disease and
mortality among this group [61].
Finally, one observation in this study warrants further and meticulous exploration.
This entails the attitude and belief towards the origin of the disease and the
government-enforced public health measures from a religious perspective. Feeling
annoyed by the inability to perform religious practices due to forced closure of
mosques and churches was seen in the majority of study participants (67.3%). Another
observation was that about 83% of the study population believed that the origin of the
pandemic is a form of test or trial by God. A higher level of anxiety among the
aforementioned groups can be attributed to the inability of a majority of participants
to worship in large gatherings in either mosques or churches during the lockdown
period in the country. A large sum of previous reports showed that religious belief
can reduce anxiety in various health-related conditions [62-65]. Further research is
needed to establish the role of religious belief in coping at time of crisis.
Study limitations
Despite the relatively large sample size, bias was observed for gender (a majority of
females) and for age. However, age seems to reflect the age distribution among the
residents of Jordan at least to some extent. In addition, it was justified to have
predominance of residents in the Central region as it harbours roughly two-thirds of
population in Jordan including the Capital, Amman. Furthermore, we should clearly
state that the results of the current study might not be representative of the Jordanian
population. This is partly related to survey distribution via contacts and networks of
the authors, which make sampling bias inevitable. Thus, further studies are needed to
confirm our findings at different national and cultural levels. The study validity can
be another limitation despite having a majority of items adopted from previously

published work [35]. Finally, we have to state the inherent limitations of surveys
including the response of the participants in a way they think would please the
researchers, in addition to the problem of incomplete response.

Conclusions
COVID-19 poses a crisis that drastically changed the world; this is illustrated by the
social, psychological and economic impact of the disease. This pandemic is framed
with endless streams of misinformation and fake news, which has its own
consequences and spreads even more confusion. The results of this study showed
satisfactory knowledge about the disease among residents in Jordan, with lack of
knowledge in certain aspects of the disease regarding origin and conspiracy
surrounding this pandemic. Individuals with a lower socio-economic status showed
higher anxiety, lower COVID-19 knowledge and belief in misinformation. Focused
awareness and proper delivery of correct information is mandatory, particularly for
this group to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on their lives. An association
was seen between belief in the role of conspiracies, biological warfare, and 5G
networks in the origin and spread of the disease with lower levels of knowledge
regarding COVID-19 and higher level of anxiety. The spread of misinformation and
conspiracies is exacerbated by different media outlets, which is why proper
management and close monitoring of posted content is necessary.
