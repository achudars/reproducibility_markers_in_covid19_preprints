Abstract
Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster
over winter than during summer. It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were
more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this
relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well
understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing
COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19
reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease
will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that Air Drying
Capacity (ADC; an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virusladen droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in
shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike
temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent
seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany
and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social,
biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental
determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19. However, we argue that ADC and
UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale. These findings could
help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming
seasons.

Plain Language Summary
There is growing scientific interest in the potential seasonality of COVID-19 and its links to
climate variables. This study aims to determine whether four environmental variables, namely
temperature, humidity, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), and ultraviolet radiation (UV), are probable
environmental determinants for the observed seasonal dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence, based
on extensive country-level data spanning the first year of the pandemic. Although the influence
of socio-economic factors may be dominant, we here suggest that ADC and UV are key
environmental determinants of COVID-19 and can potentially affect the transmission and
seasonality of the disease across a wide range of climates.

1 Introduction
Since the 2019 novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 was initially reported in
December 2019 in Wuhan, the epicenter of the current pandemic (Li et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020), there has been growing scientific interest in the seasonality of this novel disease and the
potential influence of climate variables. However, the analysis on this issue has been
complicated by limited data. Nonetheless, based on epidemiological studies involving other Viral
Respiratory Diseases (VRDs; e.g., influenza), which, like COVID-19, are mainly transmitted by
contact, droplets, and fomites (Stilianakis and Drossinos, 2010; Dhand and Li, 2020), it may be
possible to provisionally infer not only the seasonal nature of COVID-19, but also the role of
environmental factors in shaping this seasonality.
A well-known and well-studied VRD is influenza, which tends to peak during winter in
temperate regions (e.g., Shaman and Khon, 2009; Tamerius et al., 2011; 2013; Ballester et al.,
2016; Choi et al., 2020). Previous studies have attempted to understand its seasonality by
considering the effects of environmental/weather conditions on virus survival and
transmissibility. Based on experiments with inoculated guinea pigs, Lowen et al. (2007) reported
that the transmission of the influenza virus was significantly suppressed under high absolute
humidity and warm temperature conditions. Subsequent research based on similar laboratory
experiments emphasized the role of absolute humidity over relative humidity as a key
environmental factor of influenza transmission (Shaman and Kohn, 2009). The analysis of data
from temperate regions further supported the hypothesis that low specific humidity conditions
favoured the survival and transmission of the influenza virus at the scale of populations, and
could be the main cause of winter epidemics (Shaman et al., 2010; 2011).
However, this perspective failed to account for influenza dynamics in tropical countries,
where the disease typically peaks during the wet season (Tamerius et al., 2011). Further research
argued that seasonality in tropical regions could be explained by a modulation of the effect of
absolute humidity with temperature, with “cold-dry” and “warm-wet” conditions favoring
influenza transmission (Tamerius et al., 2013; Deyle et al., 2016). Yet, it is still unclear why
influenza would respond differently to absolute humidity at different temperatures, and why
different statistical relationships would be needed for countries of different climates and
latitudes. In addition, the exact mechanisms by which absolute humidity may affect the survival

and transmission of the influenza virus remain unknown. Much of the attention has also focused
on whether the environment affected virus survival and host contagiousness. Yet, since influenza
and VRDs in general are transmitted in large part through respiratory droplets, environmental
conditions may also affect VRD prevalence through their effect on the fate of these droplets. In
an earlier study, we proposed by contrast that the prevalence of influenza, and VRDs in general,
was likely to be shaped instead by the Air Drying Capacity (ADC; see Section 2.2), a state
variable involving both temperature and humidity, which controls the evolution of respiratory
droplets and is based on Maxwell’s theory of droplet evolution via coupled heat and mass
transfer (Maxwell, 2003; Choi et al., 2020).
Regarding COVID-19, most of the virus prevalence during the initial stage of the
pandemic was found in areas with specific climate conditions: average temperatures of 5-11

℃,

combined with low specific humidity of 3-6 g/kg (Sajadi et al., 2020); and temperature range of
3 to 17

℃ with humidity between 4 and 9 g/m (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020). Further studies also

argued that low temperature and low humidity were major drivers behind the explosive increase
in confirmed COVID-19 cases, because they weakened the host’s immune system and increased
virus stability and transmission (e.g., Araújo and Naimi, 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wu et al.,
2020; Chin et al., 2020; Moriyama et al., 2020). On the other hands, several studies have
emphasized the effect of atmospheric humidity on the prevalence of this disease, consistent with
influenza dynamics (Baker et al., 2020; Ward et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020). By contrast, the
spread of COVID-19 was found to be more correlated with temperature than humidity in certain
areas (Bherwani et al., 2020; Kaplin et al., 2020; Tosepu et al., 2020; Xie and Zhu, 2020). In
addition, attention has also focused on Ultraviolet (UV) radiation as a potential environmental
factor impacting VRD transmission (Carleton et al., 2021). Laboratory and epidemiological
studies have shown that strong UV radiation appeared to have a profound effect on the survival
of SARS-Cov-2 and other coronaviruses (Duan et al., 2003; Darnell et al., 2004; Seyer and
Sanlidag 2020; Schuit et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020).
These studies provide some evidence that environmental variables play some role on
COVID-19 transmission, even though it is generally agreed that many determinants, including
social, biological, and environmental factors, shape the transmission of VRDs. In particular, the
massive measures taken by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have strongly

impacted its dynamics (Bherwani et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Additionally, most studies
have focused on the initial months of the pandemic, when data was too limited to detect strong
seasonal signals (Sajadi et al., 2020; Bukhari and Jameel, 2020; wang et al., 2020a). Therefore, at
this stage, it remains unclear to what extent COVID-19 prevalence exhibits seasonality, whether
this seasonality is shaped by environmental factors, and if so, which are the most important.
Here, we focus on these questions by examining relationships between COVID-19 prevalence
and environmental variables across a wide range of climates, based on available data covering
the first year of the pandemic.

2 Data and Method
2.1 Datasets
6-hourly temperature, dew point temperature and surface pressure data, and hourly UV
fields are taken from the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al. 2018) at 0.25° × 0.25° horizontal
resolution, for the period ranging from March 1st, 2020 to January 13th, 2021. With this data we
calculate daily mean temperature, specific humidity, and ADC (see Section 2.2). Since
population is not uniformly distributed within each country, we avoid simple country-averaged
climate variables which do not correctly reflect the climate conditions to which the population is
exposed. Instead, we calculate population-weighted average temperature, specific humidity,
ADC, and UV across all grid cells contained in a given country, based on weights obtained from
a gridded distribution of population density, following Carleton et al. (2021). Population density
data is taken from the gridded population of the world (GPW) v4 dataset (CIESIN, 2018).
Daily data on confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of tests, stringency index (i.e., a
composite index of political measures) and population for each country are from the “Our World
in Data” database (available at https://ourworldindata.org/). Subnational-level COVID-19
epidemiological data for the Australia, China, and Canada are available at the Johns Hopkins
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE; https://data.humdata.org/).
Daily COVID-19 data at the scale of different states within the United States are provided at the
COVID Tracking Project (available at https://covidtracking.com/). A threshold of at least 10,000
cumulative COVID-19 tests per 1 million people was retained to discard countries with
unrepresentative data. This criterion can somewhat ensure the reliability of the data, although it
still has severe limitations (see discussion). This approach yields 54 countries in the temperate
Northern Hemisphere, and six tropical countries (Table 1), which are predominantly influenced
by tropical monsoon systems with hot-humid summers. To isolate the role of environmental
factors in modulating the spread and potential seasonality of COVID-19, five representative
countries are carefully selected, which have different climate conditions and constant social
controls (i.e., stringency index does not change significantly) over the analysis period (Fig. S1).
The list of analyzed countries are provided in Table 1. To consider the incubation period of
COVID-19 which is generally regarded as 4 to 7 days but can be as long as 10 days and

uncommonly even longer, we mainly use biweekly average or biweekly cumulative values (Li et
al., 2020).

2.2 Air Drying Capacity (ADC)
The current mechanistic understanding of VRD transmission assumes that VRDs are
mainly transmitted through virus-laden droplets between infectious and susceptible individuals
(Wells, 1934; Xie et al.,2007; Bourouiba, 2020). Since droplets tend to evaporate more quickly
the higher the temperature and the lower the humidity (Wang et al., 2020b), these two variables
could theoretically affect the spread of the VRD by controlling the fate of droplets in their
surrounding environment (Maxwell, 2003; Choi et al., 2020). In our earlier study, we proposed a
physically-based atmospheric state-variable, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), as a relevant
environmental determinant for the transmission of VRD (Choi et al., 2020). We define ADC, (in
mm2/hr) as the rate of decrease of the droplet surface area, under given temperature and humidity
conditions. ADC is an integrated measure of temperature and humidity and is nonlinearly
proportional to temperature but inversely proportional to humidity (Table 2). ADC is defined as:

3 Results
The prevalence of COVID-19 tends to exhibit a distinct seasonality in the five
representative countries (see Section 2.1 for a selection of countries), similar to that of influenza
(Figs. 1 and S2; Tamerius et al., 2011; 2013; Choi et al., 2020). For example, temperate countries
in both hemispheres (i.e., Canada, Germany, and Chile) experienced peak COVID-19 incidence

in their respective winter months. These regions in temperate climates exhibited over the past
year opposite evolutions of COVID-19 and of the four environmental variables we consider
(temperature, specific humidity, ADC, and UV). That is, low values in temperature, humidity,
ADC, and UV generally occurred in the months of highest COVID-19 incidence.
On the other hand, COVID-19 appears to have peaked during northern hemisphere
summer in tropical regions (i.e., India, and Ethiopia), specifically at the time of the monsoons
when specific humidity was at its highest. There, the seasonality of COVID-19 and that of
temperature and specific humidity thus turn out to be inconsistent with what is observed for
temperate regions, as is the case for influenza (Tamerius et al., 2011). The seasonal evolution of
ADC and UV, by contrast, is consistent with COVID-19 prevalence in all countries (Figs 1k to
1t). High UV and high ADC linked to lower prevalence, and vice-versa, although this
relationship is weak over a certain period in autumn over India. This result is in line with the
expected effect of these two variables on the survival and transmissibility of SARS-Cov-2 (e.g.,
Choi et al., 2020; Seyer and Sanlidag, 2020; Schuit et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020).
The case of India in particular is quite striking, especially since the country attracted much
attention due to the explosiveness of its COVID-19 outbreak and its different timing of peak
incidence (e.g., Bherwani et al., 2020) compared to those in temperate regions.
Pooling the data for the five representative countries together and conditioning biweekly
new COVID-19 cases on the various environmental variables yields further insights consistent
with the previous analysis (Fig. 2). While COVID-19 spread appears lowest at high
temperatures, the peak in COVID-19 spread occurs at somewhat average temperatures and the
relationship is altogether inconsistent. Similarly, new cases are at their highest at low specific
humidity values, but almost as high when specific humidity is large as well. By contrast, the
conditioning on ADC and UV stands out as much more consistent: (1) COVID-19 prevalence
nonlinearly increases as ADC approaches zero, in keeping with its effect on virus-laden droplets
exhaled by infected patients (Choi et al., 2020); (2) similarly, low UV values appear to provide
favorable conditions for the spread of the disease, consistent with the impact of UV light on the
survival of SARS-CoV-2 (Seyer and Sanlidag, 2020; Schuit et al., 2020; Carleton et al., 2021);
and (3) the lowest ADC (0-2 mm2/hr) and UV (2-10 W/m2) values with a probability less than
15% are systematically linked to the largest numbers of COVID-19 infections (Figs S2, 2c, 2d,
2g, and 2h). Given the relatively similar and constant level of social control in the five analyzed

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252243; this version posted March 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

countries, these findings suggest that ADC and UV, unlike temperature and humidity, are likely
environmental determinants of COVID-19 spread and its seasonality.
To further advance our understanding of the possible link between COVID-19
seasonality and the four environmental variables, we now analyze data from all available
countries with sufficient number of tests, divided into temperate countries in the Northern
Hemisphere, and tropical, monsoon-dominated countries (see Section 2.1; Table 1). We find
supportive evidence for strong negative relationships between all four environmental variables
and COVID-19 spread in the temperate group (Figs 3a-3d, and 4a-4d). Interestingly, in the early
stages of pandemic (i.e., first half of the year), ADC and UV exhibit more consistent variability
with COVID-19 infections rather than temperature and humidity (i.e., COVID-19 prevalence,
ADC, and UV does not change very much, while temperature and humidity increase sharply;
Figs. 3a-3d). The discrepancy among them is more obvious in tropical monsoon regions, as
expected from results shown in Figs 1-2, and previous influenza studies (e.g., Tamerius et al.,
2011). Consistent with the previous 5-country analysis, the tropical group, with a sharp rise in
new COVID-19 cases during the wet season, stands in contrast to temperate group. Only ADC
and UV, unlike temperature and humidity, show seasonal variations consistent with those of
COVID-19 spread across the two groups of countries (Figs. 3g-3h).
Conditioning once more COVID-19 cases on the values of the four environmental
variables, different statistical relationships are found for the two selected climate zones. The
temperate Northern Hemisphere is characterized by a nonlinear decrease of COVID-19 cases
with all four variables (Fig. 4), whereas in tropical monsoon regions, COVID-19 cases increase
with both temperature and humidity (Fig. 5). By contrast, ADC and UV both show consistent
negative relationships with COVID-19 regardless of the region (Figs 4-5). The spread of
COVID-19 seems in particular to be very constrained at ADCs of 5 mm2/hr or larger. Its
sensitivity is also obviously nonlinear, consistent with Choi et al. (2020). Additionally, low UV
values (0 to 15 W/m2), though quite rare at the annual scale, systematically occur in conjunction
with high numbers of new COVID-19 cases, especially in the temperate regions (Figs. 3d, and
4d).

4 Discussion and conclusion
Through extensive country-level data spanning the 1-year pandemic period, this study
evaluates and compares the role of four environmental variables (temperature, humidity, ADC,
and UV) with the potential to influence the spread of COVID-19. Three important results that
emerge from this study are that: (1) the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 appears to display
some seasonality consistent, to some extent, with the seasonality of the analyzed environmental
variables and their known relationships to influenza seasonality; (2) two environmental variables
in particular, ADC and UV, evolve consistently with COVID-19 spread across the selected
countries of all climates and at both the weekly and the seasonal timescales, and their
relationship to COVID-19 spread is consistent with their respective effects on the fate of
respiratory droplets (ADC, Choi et al. 2020) and on virus survival (UV, Seyer and Sanlidag,
2020; Schuit et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020). Therefore, ADC and UV may provide
the basis for a physically-based framework shaping seasonal variations in COVID-19 prevalence
across the world; and (3) we also find that, as was the case for influenza, absolute humidity and
temperature do not exhibit a consistent relationship to COVID-19 cases across all climate zones.
Their statistical relationships change directions whether one considers temperate or tropical
monsoon countries, which casts doubt as to their true relevance for COVID-19 spread at the
country scale, all the more so as the physical mechanisms that could explain these relationships
and why they differ depending on the background climate remain unknown. By contrast, the
statistical relationship between COVID-19 prevalence and ADC or UV is both consistent across
climate zones and with the known physical effects of these two variables on disease
transmission. Naturally, all four variables are, to some extent, correlated with each other (Table
2). Temperature and humidity tend to evolve in concert, as warmer air generally holds more
moisture. Similarly, for temperate countries, both ADC and UV tend to reach their minimum
during winter, when both temperature and specific humidity are also lowest. But such is not the
case in tropical, monsoon-dominated countries.
Before concluding, it is important to mention that this study naturally presents several
important caveats. First, as for any COVID-19-related study, the quality, extensiveness and
uniformity of the data is subject to caution. COVID-19 case data is strongly impacted by testing
rates and policies, which differ in space (between different countries) but also in time, since
testing protocols have evolved over time. Although this study applied the threshold of at least

10,000 cumulative COVID-19 tests per 1 million people to discard countries with
unrepresentative data, but considering all countries without quality control may provide other
conclusions that are inherent with high uncertainty. Influenza data also suffers from the same
biases, which are inevitable in any global study. Additionally, the spread of COVID-19 is largely
shaped by policy measures, such as social distancing, mask mandates, school closures, and event
cancellations (Bherwani et al., 2020; Poirier et al., 2020). Finally, we did not consider the effects
of indoor environments (e.g., heating and air conditioning), which may also influence the
seasonality of VRD (e.g., Xie et al., 2007; Shaman and Kohn, 2009). As always in such cases,
one must be careful in concluding about the role of environmental variables in shaping VRD
dynamics (Carlson et al., 2020; Zaitchik et al., 2020). Even though vaccines have recently been
developed and are currently being administered, and though it is hoped that SARS-Cov-2 will
soon be controlled effectively, there is still a possibility that this virus will stay with us as a
seasonal disease with milder effects, like influenza. Our findings could therefore help guide the
development of a sound adaptation strategy against COVID-19 over the coming years.
