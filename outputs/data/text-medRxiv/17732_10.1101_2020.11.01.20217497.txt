ABSTRACT

Objective: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with a large variety of
neurological disorders. However the mechanisms underlying these neurological complications
remain elusive. In this study we aimed at determining whether neurological symptoms were
caused by SARS-CoV-2 direct infection or by either systemic or local pro-inflammatory
mediators.

Methods: We checked for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies
and for 49 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (by Luminex) in the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF)
+/- sera of a cohort of 22 COVID-19 patients with neurological presentation and 55 neurological
control patients (inflammatory [IND], non-inflammatory [NIND], multiple sclerosis [MS]).

Results: We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virus-specific antibodies in the CSF of 0/22 and
10/21 COVID-19 patients, respectively. Of the four categories of tested patients, the CSF of
IND exhibited the highest level of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. In contrast,
COVID-19 patients did not present overall upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the CSF.
However, the CSF of patients with severe COVID-19 (ICU patients) exhibited higher
concentrations of CCL2, CXCL8, and VEGF-A in the CSF than patients with a milder form of
COVID-19. In addition, we could show that intrathecal CXCL8 synthesis was linked to an
elevated barrier index and correlated to the increase of peripheral inflammation (serum HGF
and CXCL10).

Conclusion: Our results point at an absence of massive SARS-CoV-2 infection or
inflammation of the central nervous system, but highlight a specific impairment of the
neurovascular unit linked to intrathecal production of CXCL8.

INTRODUCTION

Corona viruses’ outbreaks have been repeatedly associated with neurological disorders.
Indeed, human tropic coronaviruses seem able to reach the central nervous system and are
found in brain necropsies and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) patients

1, 2

. In mouse model, it has been shown that a

strain of human tropic coronavirus is able to reach the olfactory bulb trough the cribriform plate
and then to spread through a neuron-to-neuron transmission 3.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shown a large range of neurological complications
4

that may be classified as followed: critical care-related neurological syndromes either central

(encephalopathy with sub-cortical deficit characterized by attention and executive dysfunction)
or

peripheral

(critical

care-associated

polyneuropathies

or

myopathies

)

5

;

anosmia/dysgueusia 6; myelo-meningo-encephalitis 7; Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), and
its variant affecting cranial nerves (Miller-Fischer Syndrome) 8; and cerebrovascular disease
(strokes) 9.
If data from previous outbreaks point to a neurotropism of the coronaviruses, the
pathophysiology underlying SARS-CoV-2-related neurological deficits remains elusive.
Indeed, to date, SARS-CoV-2 has only been rarely found in the CSF, suggesting that direct
brain infection is unlikely 10, 11. Thus, the main hypotheses to explain neurological complications
in COVID patients point at mechanisms either related to low grade presence of the virus in the
CNS, to disturbance of the blood brain interface by action of peripheral cytokines on brain
endothelium or to the presence of an auto-immune response, such as anti-neuronal antibodies
by analogy to what occurs in autoimmune encephalitis. However, data firmly establishing one
or the other hypothesis are still missing. Yet, the fact that encephalitis/encephalopathies
caused by SARS-CoV-2 may respond to corticosteroids

In an attempt to decipher mechanisms underlying neurological symptoms, we looked at SARSCoV-2-encoding

RNA,

SARS-CoV-2-specific

antibodies

and

at

a

panel

of

49

cytokines/chemokines/growth factors in the CSF of 77 study patients. Twenty-two of them
suffered from COVID-19, and 55 were control SARS-CoV-2-negative patients suffering from
inflammatory, including MS or non-inflammatory neurological disorders. We found that COVID19 patients hospitalized in ICU present signs of blood brain barrier impairment linked to
possible astrocyte activation, but no strong immune response in the CSF or obvious CNS
infection by the virus.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study population. All consecutive patients seen at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV)
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (March to end of December 2020) with any
neurological manifestations and for whom a lumbar puncture including SARS-CoV-2 PCR on
the CSF was performed, were included in this study. Patients with a nasopharyngeal swab
positive for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR and/or a serology test for anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies together with clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as
COVID-19 patients (25 patients). Of those 25 patients, 3 has a neurological presentation that
was likely explained by another condition than COVID-19. Therefore, they were removed from
the study. The 22 enrolled COVID-19 patients were further divided into two subgroups whether
they requested intensive care unit (ICU), hereafter referred to as severe COVID-19 (13
patients) or not, hereafter referred to as moderate COVID-19 (9 patients). Patients whose
nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test came back negative were enrolled as controls and
classified as inflammatory neurological disorder (IND; 9 patients) or non-inflammatory
neurological disorder (NIND; 4 patients) depending on their diagnosis. The control cohort also
included 42 patients who were diagnosed with inflammatory neurological disorder (IND; 12
patients), non-inflammatory neurological disorder (NIND; 15 patients) or multiple sclerosis
(MS; 15 patients). Serum and CSF of these 42 patients had been drawn prior to the COVID-

19 pandemic, in the frame of the COOLIN’BRAIN cohort, between 2009 and 2019. In the
subsequent analyses, IND patients who were enrolled during the pandemic period were pooled
with the IND patients enrolled before 2020, through COOLIN’BRAIN. The same is true for
NIND. Samples (serum and CSF) from MS patients were all obtained during a clinical relapse
of MS prior to any corticosteroid treatment.
Samples. In all study subjects, the lumbar puncture was performed at the acute phase of
neurological symptoms. When available, we also analysed serum collected at the same time
as the CSF to obtain paired samples (16/22 COVID-19, 14/21 IND, 15/19 NIND, and 15/15 MS
patients). Samples of COVID-19 patients and control subjects were run at the same time for
detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokines/chemokines/growth factors.
SARS-CoV-2 PCR. SARS-CoV-2 tests in CSF specimens were performed using our
automated platform with an in-house RT-qPCR targeting the E-gene with the primers and
probe described by Corman and colleagues

14

. SARS-CoV-2 tests in respiratory specimens

were performed either using our automated platform (at the beginning of the pandemic) or
using the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test on the cobas 6800 instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland),
since March 24, 2020. Both methods were compared and exhibited 99.2% of concordant
results 15.

SARS-CoV-2 serology. Anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG specific to the native trimeric Spike (S) protein
were quantified using a multiplex bead assay as previously described 16. Anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG
levels were expressed as a ratio of the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) signals detected in
the serum or CSF samples and the MFI signal detected in the negative control samples. AntiSARS-CoV2 IgG ratio ≥6 in serum samples were considered positive (threshold set for
diagnosis at the Lausanne University Hospital). In the CSF, positivity threshold was set using
the mean value of SARS-CoV-2 negative patients + five times SD (positivity threshold = 0.65).
Cytokine detection by Luminex assay. The concentration of cytokines/chemokines/growth
factors in serum and CSF was determined by multiplex bead assay (Thermofisher). The

concentration of the following 49 soluble markers was assessed: IL-1alpha, IL-1RA, IL-1beta,
IL-2 , IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-21, IL -22, IL23, IL-27, IL-31, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4
(MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL11 (Eotaxin), CXCL1 (GRO-α / KC), CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL9
(MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL12 (SDF-1α), CXCL13 (BLC), TNF-beta, NGF-beta, BDNF,
EGF, HGF FGF-2, LIF, PDGF-BB, PlGF-1, SCF, VEGF-A, VEGF-D, BAFF, GM-CSF and GCSF. The assay was performed as per manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described 17.
Ethics. This study was approved by the Canton de Vaud Ethical Committee (CER-VD) in the
frame of CORO-NEURO study (authorization n° 2020-01123) and COOLIN-BRAIN study
(authorization n°2018-01622). All patients included in this study signed specific informed
consent.
Graphical representation and statistical analysis. Graphical representation and statistics were
generated using PRISM software (version 8.1.2, GraphPad software, La Jolla, Ca, USA).
Multiple group analysis were made using Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison
test. For analysis with 2 groups, Mann-Whitney test was used to determine statistical
significance for continuous variables and Fischer exact test for categorical variables.
Heatmaps and k clustering were made using ClustVis web-based tool 18.

RESULTS
Clinical characteristics.
From March to November 2020, 38 patients benefited from a research of SARS-CoV-2 by RTqPCR and had a concomitant lumbar puncture because of acute neurological symptoms. Of
those, 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on association of typical symptoms
and positive laboratory tests (positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR (92%) or serology (8%).
Their neurological symptoms could not be attributed to another condition than COVID-19 itself.
As mentioned in the Methods, there were three additional COVID-19 patients whose

neurological disorders were unrelated to COVID-19 (MOG-associated disorders, Lyme’s
disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus). In order to avoid any bias, they were not
included in further analyses.
Clinical description of SARS-CoV-2 patients is summarized in Table 1. These 22 patients
presented with various neurological presentation including encephalopathy (12), encephalitis
(2), myelitis (1), optic neuritis (1), Guillain-Barré Syndrome (1), mononeuritis (1) and
headache/vertigo (4).
More than half of them (13) were admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), including 9 who
required mechanical ventilation. As compared to patients with moderate COVID, patients
admitted to ICU were older, had a higher BMI and suffered from more comorbidities. Most of
these ICU patients presented with encephalopathy (11/13). Furthermore, some presented
signs of critical illness myopathy/polyneuropathy, a diagnosis which was confirmed by nerve
conduction studies for most of them (6/8).
No prominent MRI abnormalities were found except in one patient who presented signs of
vasculitis including T2 lesions, micro-bleeds and diffusion restriction.
Most electroencephalographic (EEG) recording performed (7/8) showed some abnormalities,
consisting mainly in encephalopathic slowing but also irritative activity in one patient with
encephalitis.
CSF characteristics.
The CSF of COVID-19 patients was characterised mainly by elevation of protein level and
elevated albumin index. Oligoclonal bands were found in a minority of patients. In fact, most
of the bands identified on iso-electrofocalisation were shared between the serum and the CSF
(type 4; Table 2). These features point toward an opening of the blood brain barrier. Pleocytosis
was encountered only in few patients with encephalitic presentation. Interestingly, a striking
difference between severe and moderate COVID-19 patients was the higher proportion of
elevated barrier index in the former (8/11 - 73%) than in the latter (1/6 -16%) (p = 0,049).

As expected, the CSF profile was characterized by high protein level and pleocytosis in most
IND patients and oligoclonal bands restricted to the CSF (type 2) in all MS patients (Table 2).

SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies detection in the serum and CSF.
All 22 COVID-19 patients underwent a RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the
CSF. It came back negative in all, despite positivity for most (90%) in the nasal swab (table 1).
Among patients who had a serological test (14 patients), it came back positive for SARS-CoV2 antibodies in the blood of 12 (86%). The titers were high (mean ratio of 84.1 for a positivity
threshold of >6). The absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the remaining two patients,
contrasting with a positive nasal RT-qPCR, could be explained by the short time lapse between
first symptoms and sampling (respectively 4 and 7 days). Conversely, two patients with IND
had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies slightly above the positive threshold in the blood
(respectively 8.4 and 7.7, positivity threshold >6) (Fig. 1C). Of note, these two patients
presented with pathologies regularly associated with cross-reactive antibodies: sarcoidosis19
and paraneoplastic syndrome

20

.

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the CSF of 10/21 COVID-19 patients with
an IgG index >0.65. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not detected in the CSF of the
55 control study patients (p<0.0001; Fig. 1B).

Cytokines/Chemokines/Growth factors in the serum and CSF
First, an unbiased analysis of the cytokine panel in the serum of SARS-CoV-2, IND, NIND and
MS patients revealed two clusters. Most patients (9/11) with severe COVID-19 belonged to the
inflammatory cluster (cluster 2) (Fig. 1C). We found a significant increase of IL-1RA, CXCL9,
CXCL10, CXCL12 and HGF in the serum of severe SARS-CoV-2-infected patients as
compared to moderate ones (Fig. 1D). In addition, we also found elevated IL-6 levels
(>11pg/ml) in 7 out of 11 (63.6%) sera of severe COVID-19 patients versus only 1 out of 5

(20%) of moderate COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1D). These findings recapitulate the inflammatory
profile of COVID-19 patients already identified by others

21, 22

. Similarly, all these cytokines

except CXCL12 were also increased in the serum of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients compared
to neurological control subjects (MS, IND, NIND) (Fig. e1A).
While SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with neurological conditions were displaying increased
inflammatory mediators in the serum, this was not the case in the CSF. Indeed, analyses
performed in this compartment revealed that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were mainly
clustered with NIND and MS ones, while the CSF of IND patients exhibited a strong immune
signature, characterized by elevated levels of several cytokines, chemokines and growth
factors (Fig. 2A). This unbiased clustering was confirmed by individual cytokine/chemokine
analysis with significant elevation of IL-1RA, IL-6, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10,
CXCL12, CXCL13 and G-CSF in the CSF of IND as compared to the one of NIND patients
(Fig. 2B and data not shown). Even if they did not display as strong an immune signature as
IND patients, MS patients showed higher levels of CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL13 and G-CSF in
the CSF (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Of note, COVID-19 patients did not display a significant
increase of any of these factors as compared to NIND except for CXCL8 (Data not shown).
Accordingly, the clustering based on all inflammatory mediators did not allow to discriminate
severe from moderate COVID-19 patients thus demonstrating the absence of cytokine storm
in the CSF (Fig. 2A). Yet, interestingly, by individual cytokine/chemokine/growth factors
analysis, we found 3 mediators differentially expressed between moderate and severe SARSCoV-2 patients: CXCL8, CCL2 and VEGF-A (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the levels of CXCL8 and
VEGF-A tended to be higher in the CSF of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with
encephalopathy, 85% of them belonging to the ICU group (Fig. 2C).
As mentioned above, the proportion of patients with an elevated albumin index was
significantly higher in severe than in moderate COVID-19 patients. We thus investigated the
relationship between this index and the CSF levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and VEGF-A. We
observed that CXCL8 was significantly higher in the CSF of patients with elevated albumin

index while VEGF-A almost reached statistical significance (p=0.059) but CCL2 showed no
difference (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Since an elevated albumin index is a sign of blood
brain barrier opening, we next looked at the correlation of CXCL8, VEGF-A and CCL2 levels
in serum and CSF. CXCL8 was undetectable in the serum of COVID-19 patients, expect for
only 2 of them (Fig. 1D). Serum levels of VEGF-A did not show any correlation with the CSF
ones (r2=0.004, p value = 0.65), whereas there was a trend for a correlation of CCL2
concentrations between the 2 compartments (r2=0.22, p value = 0.06; Fig. e1B). This absence
of correlation concentrations between the serum and the CSF, at least for CXCL8 and VEGFA suggest that the increased CSF levels of these chemokines is not the result of a mere
leakage from the periphery, but rather reflects that they are produced intrathecally. Of note,
concentrations of CXCL8 and VEGF-A in the CSF correlated together (Fig. e1C), reinforcing
the idea that secretion of these factors is linked in COVID-19 context.
Finally, we found that and increased serum level of CXCL10 and HGF was correlated with an
increased CSF concentration of CXCL8 (Fig. 2E).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we attempted to understand the pathogenesis of neurological impairments in the
context of COVID-19 disease.
First, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the CSF of any of our 22 patients. Most authors
addressing the question also report absence of evidence of viral dissemination in the brain of
COVID-19 patients, thus ruling out this causality in the majority of COVID-19-associated
neurological disorders. However, we found that about half of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients
exhibited virus-specific antibodies in their CSF. Due to the nature of our assay, we were not in
a position to determine whether these antibodies in the CSF result from an intra-thecal
production or from a passive diffusion through a permeable blood-brain barrier. In any case, it
is possible that they are instrumental in the antiviral response in the brain. Supporting these

findings, authors recently showed that the CSF from a COVID-19 patient displayed neutralizing
antibodies able to prevent neuronal infection in an hiPSC-derived brain organoid model 23.
Most importantly, our cohort composed of both severe and moderate patients with paired CSF
and serum samples allowed us to study the relationship between peripheral inflammation,
neuroinflammation and neurological complications in both sub groups of COVID-19 patients.
First, we were able to show that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, even with a severe disease,
do not display a cytokine storm in the CSF despite their sera being the most inflammatory of
all 4 groups of study patients. Of note, these patients exhibit an inflammatory profile in the
serum similar to what was reported by several groups 21, 22 thus ruling out that our samples
would have been collected after the resolution of the inflammation.
Our findings are in line with a previous report showing low concentrations of IL-6, IL-10 and
IFN in the CSF of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with neurological complications 24. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no other authors have looked so far at such an extensive number
of inflammatory mediators, nor have they included such selected control cohorts of study
patients with paired CSF/serum samples allowing the assessment of soluble factors in both
compartments at the same time.
Interestingly, we could show that patients with a severe COVID-19 exhibited higher CSF levels
of CXCL8, CCL2 and VEGF-A than SARS-CoV-2 patients with a moderate disease. In
particular, patients suffering from an encephalopathy displayed the highest levels of VEGF-A
and CXCL8. Most importantly, despite evidence of blood brain barrier disruption, we found a
total absence of correlation between the concentrations of CXCL8 and VEGF-A in the CSF
and in the serum. Thus, these data seem to rule out that the increased levels of CXCL8 and
VEGF-A in the CSF be a consequence of blood brain barrier opening but rather indicate a local
production of these 2 soluble factors in the CNS. Yet, CXCL8 has recently been associated
with neurological complications in severe COVID-1925.
So, in our study, CXCL8 and VEGF-A were associated with an increased barrier index thus
linking the intra-CNS production of these mediators with an involvement of the neurovascular

unit (brain endothelium and astrocytes). In the brain, both factors are produced by astrocytes
and endothelial cells, and are able to impair the blood brain barrier function 26, 27. Precisely,
microvascular injuries in the brain are a key feature in severe COVID-19 patients28.
Following this line of evidence, previous reports have found elevated levels of GFAP and YKL40 pointing to an enhanced astrocyte reactivity in severe COVID-19 patients with neurological
complications.

25, 29-32

. Yet, when activated, astrocytes can lead to the disruption of the blood

brain barrier via both soluble factor production and reduction of astrocytic gap junctions, among
other mechanisms. Integrating our findings with what is known in the literature, we propose
that in patients with COVID-19 encephalopathy, there is an increased astrocytic reactivity
leading to a disruption of the blood brain barrier. Further supporting this hypothesis, this
mechanism has been described in patients who present with a delirium associated with critical
care

33

. Furthermore, it is known that hypoxia has strong disrupting effects on the

neurovascular unit. Indeed, experimental models have demonstrated that hypoxia causes the
production of CXCL8, CCL2 and VEGF-A with discrete production of other inflammatory
cytokines34 thus mirroring our data from patients. Precisely, hypoxia was present in all patients
classified here as severe with 9/13 (69%) requiring mechanical ventilation.
Finally, we found that the intrathecal production of CXCL8 and VEGF-A was correlated to
serum HGF and CXCL10. HGF is an instrumental growth factor for tissue repair secreted in
response to tissue damage. Its concentration in the serum has been proposed as a prognostic
biomarker in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection22. In this context, HGF increase seems to appear
as a consequence of inflammation and may be a reflection of tissue damage induced by the
peripheral cytokine increase .
To conclude, our results suggest that encephalopathies in severe SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients are not due to a major viral infection of the brain, neither to a leakage of the cytokine
storm from the periphery into the CNS. However, we identify a strong link between
encephalopathies and blood brain barrier impairment. Taken together, our study identifies a
potential mechanism by which the activation of neurovascular unit cells lead to barrier

Figure 1 – SARS-CoV-2 PCR/serology and Serum Cytokines/Chemokines/Growth factors in COVID-19
patients and control subjects. (A) Schematic representation of experimental design. Thirty-eight patients
sampled during COVID-19 pandemic and 42 from the biobank of the Service of neurology (COOLIN’BRAIN)
were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression and/or SARS-CoV-2 serology and/or Luminex assay for 49
cytokines/chemokines/growth factors. Of note the CSF +/- serum of all the 42 study subjects who were part of
COOLIN’BRAIN was harvested prior to January 2020, thus before the arrival of SARS-CoV2 in Switzerland. (B)
Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 detection in the serum and/or the CSF of patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection
(red circles, n=14 for serum, n=21 for CSF), IND (green circles, n=14 for serum, n=23 for CSF), NIND (blue
circles, n=16 for serum, n=22 for CSF), and MS (yellow circles, n=14 for serum, n=15 for CSF). All 77 study
patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serologies either in the serum or the CSF or in both compartments. Dotted

comparisons of cytokines/chemokines and growth factors within CSF of SARS-CoV-2 infected, and uninfected,
i.e IND, NIND and MS patients. Expression is represented in log10 scale. K-means clustering was used to
determine patients clusters (Cluster 1, n=1; Cluster 2, n=10; Cluster 3, n=66). Cytokines/chemokines/growth
factors with no variations across all patients are not displayed. (B) Bar plot representation (mean ± SEM) with
log10 scale of IL-1RA, CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL9 CXCL10, CXCL12, HGF and VEGF-A expression in the CSF of
patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection (red circles, n=22), IND (green circles, n=21) or NIND (blue circles, n=19) or
MS (yellow circles, n=15). Statistical significance calculated using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
multiple comparisons test, all comparisons performed are displayed (adjusted p:* ≤ 0.05, ** ≤ 0.01, *** ≤ 0.001,
**** ≤ 0.001). (C) CXCL8 and VEGF-A expression (mean ± SEM) according to neurological diagnosis associated
to COVID-19. (D) Representation of expression of CXCL8 and VEGF-A in COVD-19 patients with elevated
albumin index (n=9) or not (n=8). Statistical significance was calculated using Mann-Whitney test (p:* ≤ 0.05, **
≤ 0.01). (E) Linear regression of CXCL8 in the CSF compared to serum HGF (left panel) and serum CXCL10
(right panel).
