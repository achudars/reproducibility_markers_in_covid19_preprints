SUMMARY

2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread within the

3

human population. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans had been

4

previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human coronaviruses

5

(hCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we quantified levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive

6

antibodies and hCoV-reactive antibodies in serum samples collected from 204 humans before the

7

COVID-19 pandemic. We then quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a

8

separate cohort of 252 individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2.

9

Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of

10

hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-

11

reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that ~23% of these

12

individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike

13

and nucleocapsid proteins. These antibodies were not associated with protection against SARS-

14

CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but paradoxically these hCoV cross-reactive antibodies

15

were boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

22

Coronaviruses commonly infect humans1-4. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

23

(SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 and has rapidly spread among humans, many of

24

whom have been previously exposed to common seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs)5.

25

Common seasonal hCoVs include the betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 and the

26

alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL636-9. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus and is

27

more closely related to HKU1 and OC43 compared to the alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL6310.

28

A recent study examining electronic medical records concluded that recent hCoV infections are

29

not associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infections, but are associated with reducing the

30

severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)11. It is unknown if prior hCoV exposures

31

elicit antibodies that prevent or alter the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further, it is

32

unknown if different aged individuals have distinct hCoV immune histories that can affect

33

SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. To address this, we completed a serological survey using serum

34

samples collected from different aged humans prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantified

35

levels of antibodies reactive to viral proteins from hCoVs and determined if these antibodies

36

were associated with SARS-CoV-2 protection. Finally, we completed a series of studies using

37

serum collected from COVID-19 patients to determine if antibodies reactive to hCoVs are

38

boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infections.

from 36 children (age 1-17) at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia originally collected for

45

lead testing and 168 adults (age 18-90) who had been recruited into the Penn Medicine Biobank.

46

We tested Penn Medicine Biobank samples from individuals who had no medical history of

47

cancer or organ transplantation, pregnancy during the previous 9 months, or an infectious disease

48

within the previous 28 days prior to blood draw. Using these samples, we previously found that

49

different aged individuals possess H3N2 influenza virus antibodies that have different

50

specificities12.

51

We found that 5.4% of serum samples collected in 2017 contained IgG antibodies that

52

reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike (S) protein (Figure 1a), 2.0% of samples contained

53

antibodies that reacted to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

54

(Figure 1b), and 18.6% of samples contained antibodies that reacted to the SARS-CoV-2

55

nucleocapsid (N) protein (Figure 1c). Several pre-pandemic serum samples contained antibodies

56

that were at similar levels as those in serum from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 recovered donors

57

(Figure 1a-c). Most serum samples with antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 full length S

58

protein did not have antibodies that reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein (Figure 1d),

59

which is consistent with a recent study showing that some individuals possessed pre-pandemic

60

antibodies against the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein13. In contrast to serum antibodies

61

isolated from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 recovered donors, serum antibodies from individuals

62

collected before the pandemic had very low or undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

63

antibodies, regardless of whether or not the sample possessed cross-reactive antibodies against

64

SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins (Figure 1e). We found no obvious differences in levels of

65

SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies among donors with different birth years (Figure S1 a-c).

67

Humans with Pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2-reactive Antibodies Had Elevated Levels of

68

Antibodies Against Previously Circulating Betacoronaviruses

69

We completed ELISAs to quantify levels of pre-pandemic hCoV-reactive IgG antibodies

70

in all 204 human serum samples collected in 2017. Most serum samples possessed antibodies

71

that reacted to the S protein of 229E and NL63 (both alphacoronaviruses), as well as OC43 (a

72

betacoronavirus) (Figure S1d-f). There were no major differences in levels of these antibodies

73

among individuals with different birth years, however serum from very young children possessed

74

lower levels of antibodies reactive to the 229E and NL63 S proteins (Figure S1d-f). We

75

completed full antibody titrations to directly compared levels of hCoV antibodies in a subset of

76

pre-pandemic samples from individuals who either did (n=12) or did not (n=51) possess cross-

77

reactive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Figure 1f-h). Pre-pandemic antibody levels against the 229E

78

and NL63 alphacoronavirus S proteins were similar among individuals with and without SARS-

79

CoV-2 reactive antibodies (Figure 1f-g). In contrast, antibody levels against the betacoronavirus

80

OC43 S protein were higher in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies compared to

81

individuals who did not possess pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies (Figure 1h).

82

These data suggest that pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies were likely elicited by

83

previously circulating betacoronavirus strains, such as OC43.

84
85

Pre-existing hCoV Cross-reactive Antibodies Were Not Associated With Protection From

86

SARS-CoV-2 Infections

87

It is unknown if antibodies elicited by prior hCoV infections protect against SARS-CoV-

88

2 infections and/or prevent severe COVID-19. To address this, we measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG

89

antibodies in pre-pandemic serum samples from 251 individuals who subsequently went on to

become PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2 and in a control group of pre-pandemic

91

samples from 251 matched individuals who did not become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pre-

92

pandemic samples were collected by the Penn Medicine BioBank from August 2013 to March

93

2020 and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified by nasopharyngeal swab PCR

94

testing results in electronic health records. We found that 2.2% samples possessed pre-pandemic

95

antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 full length S protein, 0.6% samples possessed pre-

96

pandemic antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, and 23.9% samples possessed pre-

97

pandemic antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Importantly, we found no

98

differences in SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies in serum samples from individuals who did or

99

did not become subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2a; S protein: p=0.62, S-RBD:

100

p=0.49, N protein: p=0.34 and Table S1 and Table S2). We also measured antibodies reactive to

101

the OC43 S protein and found no differences among samples from individuals who did or did not

102

become infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2a; p=0.90 and Table S1 and Table S2). Among

103

those with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, we found no relationship between antibody

104

titers and hospitalization or disease severity among hospitalized patients (Table S1 and Table

105

S2). We found no relationship between antibody titers and the need for respiratory support and

106

admittance into the ICU following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table S1 and Table S2).

107

Previous studies indicated that immunity to hCoV can be short-lived14 and a recent study

108

documented that antibody titers against hCoV can fluctuate over time5, presumably due to

109

repetitive hCoV exposures. In our study, pre-pandemic serum samples were collected from 2013-

110

2020 and therefore it is possible that antibody levels in some of the samples collected several

111

years prior to 2020 do not accurately reflect antibody levels present during the COVID-19

112

pandemic. To address this, we compared SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 IgG antibody titers in the

113

serum of individuals in our cohort who had samples collected within one year of the pandemic

114

(between April 2019 and March 2020). Using this smaller cohort (n=39 SARS-CoV-2 cases and

115

n=57 controls), we still found no differences in levels of antibodies reactive to the SARS-CoV-2

116

S protein, S-RBD protein, N protein, or OC43 S protein (Figure 2B). Taken together, our data

117

suggest that a subset of humans possessed non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies against

118

SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but these antibodies were not

119

associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections or reducing hospitalizations upon

120

SARS-CoV-2 infections.

122

SARS-CoV-2 Boosts Antibodies Reactive to Other Human Betacoronaviruses

123

Recent studies indicate that COVID-19 recovered donors possess higher levels of

124

antibodies against seasonal betacoronaviruses13. To determine if antibodies against the S protein

125

of hCoVs are boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we measured 229E, NL63, OC43, and

126

SARS-CoV-2 S IgG antibody levels in sera collected longitudinally from 27 hospitalized

127

COVID-19 patients. Serum IgG antibodies reactive to the S protein of the 229E and NL63

128

alphacoronaviruses did not change over 7 days of hospitalization (Figure 3A-B). Conversely,

129

serum antibodies reactive to the S protein of OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses

130

significantly increased over the course of hospitalization (Figure 3A-B). The magnitude of

131

OC43 S antibody boost was not associated with outcome of disease (Figure 3C). Taken together,

132

these data suggest that cross-reactive antibodies elicited by previous hCoV infections are not

133

associated with protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections, but are boosted following infection

134

with SARS-CoV-2.

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that ~23% of individuals possessed SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive

138

serum antibodies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using samples collected in 2017, we found

139

that pre-pandemic cross-reactive antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein were

140

more prevalent compared to those directed against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (18.6%

141

seropositive versus 5.4% seropositive). We found that most individuals possessed pre-pandemic

142

serum antibodies reactive to the S proteins of 229E, NL63, and OC43 (Figure S2); however,

143

pre-pandemic samples with detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had higher levels of

144

antibodies against the OC43 S protein (Figure 1H). Although our data suggest that prior

145

infections with seasonal human betacoronaviruses (such as OC43) likely elicit antibodies that

146

cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, in is unclear why only a subset of OC43 seropositive

147

individuals possessed antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2 prior to the pandemic. Further studies

148

will be needed to determine the temporal relationship between seasonal human betacoronavirus

149

infections and the induction of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies. Further studies

150

investigating the relationship of pre-pandemic antibodies against other betacoronaviruses, such

151

as HKU1, with pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies are also needed.

152

We show that pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies are non-neutralizing

153

and are not associated with reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospitalizations. We compared

154

serum from individuals who were and were not hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 infections and

155

found no differences in pre-pandemic antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 (Figure

156

2). We evaluated the need for respiratory support and admittance into the ICU as a proxy for

157

COVID-19 severity (Table S2); however, larger cohorts including individuals with a large range

158

of different clinically-defined disease severities will be required to determine if pre-pandemic

159

levels of antibodies are associated with reducing some aspects of severe COVID-19. Additional

160

studies need to be completed to determine if neutralizing antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2

161

infections protect against subsequent reinfections with SARS-CoV-2.

162

Further studies also need to be completed to determine how immune history affects de

163

novo immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that individuals infected

164

with SARS-CoV-2 produce antibodies reactive to both the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and OC43 S

165

protein (Figure 3). In the case of influenza viruses, sequential infections with antigenically

166

distinct strains can elicit antibodies against conserved epitopes between the strains and it is

167

unclear if these cross-reactive antibodies inhibit de novo immune responses or affect disease

168

severity15. Further studies are needed to precisely map the footprints of OC43 S-reactive

169

antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infections. Additional studies need to be completed to

170

determine if these antibodies help resolve infections or if they enhance disease in COVID-19

171

patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

194

Pre-pandemic Human Serum Samples

195

Serum samples shown in Figure 1 were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic between May

196

and August of 2017 from individuals at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP; n=36,

197

children age 0-18 years old) and through the Penn Medicine BioBank (n=168, adults >18 years

198

old). Samples from CHOP were leftover de-identified blood samples collected for routine lead

199

testing.

200
201

Serum samples shown in Figure 2 were collected via the Penn Medicine BioBank prior to the

202

pandemic (n=502, between August 2013 and March 2020). These samples were from adults who

203

subsequently had a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

204

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasopharyngeal swabs (cases, n=251), and those who

205

had SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative results (controls, n=251). The RT-qPCR clinical testing results

206

were acquired from Penn Medicine electronic health records and test results between March

207

2020 and August 2020 were included in the analysis. The Penn Medicine BioBank is an

208

established repository that routinely collects blood products from donors visiting the University

209

of Pennsylvania Healthcare system upon written informed consent. All studies were approved by

210

the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.

Human Samples Collected After SARS-CoV-2 Infection

213

Serum samples were obtained from recovered convalescent donors who had a history of PCR-

214

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=15). These samples were used in experiments shown in

215

Figure 1. Additionally, plasma samples were collected from patients admitted to the Hospital at

216

the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=27), as

217

previously described16. Hospital inpatients were categorized for pneumonia severity using a

218

WHO ordinal scale that was based on the level of oxygen support needed at day 0 and day 7. All

219

samples were collected after obtaining informed consent and studies were approved by the

220

University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.

METHOD DETAILS

231

Quantification of serum antibody titers

232

Serum antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus (hCoV) antigens were

233

quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) as previously described18. Plasmids

234

encoding the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the receptor binding domain of the S

235

(S-RBD) were provided by Florian Krammer (Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai, New York

236

City NY)19. SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were purified from 293F

237

transfected cells by Ni-NTA resin. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, and full-length hCoV

238

spike antigens (OC43, 229E, and NL63) were purchased (Sino Biological, Wayne PA; cat.

239

40588-V08B, 40607-V08B, 40604-V08B, and 40605-V08B, respectively) and reconstituted in

240

Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific: cat. 14-

241

245-153) were coated overnight at 4oC with either 2 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 antigen, 1.5 μg/mL

242

hCOV antigen, or DPBS to control for background. Sera was heat-inactivated in a 56oC water

243

bath for 1 hour prior to serial dilutions starting at 1:50 in dilution buffer (DPBS supplemented

244

with 1% milk and 0.1% Tween-20). ELISA plates were blocked with 200μL of blocking buffer

245

(DPBS supplemented with 3% milk and 0.1% Tween-20), washed 3 times with PBS plus 2%

246

Tween (PBS-T), and 50μL of diluted sera was added. After 2 hours of incubation, ELISA plates

247

were washed 3 times with PBS-T and bound antibodies were detected using a 1:5000 dilution of

248

goat anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch

249

Laboratories, West Grove PA: cat. 109-036-098). ELISA plates were developed with the

250

addition of 50 μL SureBlue 3, 3’, 5, 5’-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (SeraCare: material

251

number 5120-0077) and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 25μL of 250mM

252

hydrochloric acid after 5 minutes. Optical densities at 450nm wavelength were obtained on a

253

SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose CA). Serum antibody titers

254

were expressed as the reciprocal serum dilution at a set OD that was based off of a standard

255

curve from the monoclonal antibody CR3022 (a gift from Ian Wilson, Scripps) starting at

256

0.5μg/mL (for S-RBD and S ELISAs) or serially diluted pooled serum (for SARS-CoV-2 N

257

ELISAs and hCoV S ELISAs). Standard curves were included on every plate to control for plate-

258

to-plate variation. Antibody titers for each sample were measured in at least two technical

259

replicates performed on separate days.

260
261

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes

262

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes were generated with a previously described vesicular stomatitis virus

263

(VSV) pseudotype platform20. Briefly, pseudotyped VSV virions with SARS-CoV-2 Spike were

264

produced through transfection of 293T with 35μg of pCG1 SARS-CoV-2 S delta18 expression

265

plasmid encoding a codon optimized SARS-CoV-2 S gene with an 18-residue truncation in the

266

cytoplasmic tail (kindly provided by Stefan Pohlmann)17. 30 hours post transfection, the SARS-

267

CoV-2 spike expressing cells were infected for 2-4 hours with VSV-G pseudotyped VSVΔG-

268

RFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~1-3. Then, the cells were washed twice with media

269

to remove unbound virus. 28-30 hours after infection, the media containing the VSVΔG-RFP

270

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes were harvested and clarified by centrifugation two times at 6000xg.

271

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until used for antibody

272

neutralization analysis.

274

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers

275

Serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were measured as previously described20. Vero E6

276

cells stably expressing TMPRSS2 were seeded in 100μl at 2.5x104 cells/well in a 96 well

277

collagen coated plate. The next day, heat inactivated serum samples were serially diluted 2-fold

278

and mixed with 50-200 focus forming units/well of VSVΔG-RFP SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype

279

virus and 600ng/ml of 1E9F9, a mouse anti-VSV Indiana G (Absolute Antibody, Oxford, UK:

280

cat# Ab01402-2.0). The serum-virus mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37⁰C before being

281

plated on VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. 23-24 hours post infection, the cells were washed, fixed with

282

4% paraformaldehyde, and visualized on an S6 FluoroSpot Analyzer (CTL, Shaker Heights OH)

283

and individual infected foci were enumerated. The focus reduction neutralization titer 50%

284

(FRNT50) was measured as the greatest serum dilution at which focus count was reduced by at

285

least 50% relative to control cells that were infected with pseudotype virus in the absence of

286

human serum. FRNT50 titers for each sample were measured in at least two technical replicates

287

performed on separate days.

288
289
290

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

291

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA).

292

Reciprocal serum dilution antibody titers were log2 transformed for statistical analysis. ELISA

293

antibody titers below the limit of detection (LOD; reciprocal titer <50) were set to a reciprocal

294

titer of 25. Log2 transformed antibody titers were compared with unpaired t-tests and statistical

295

significance was set to p-value <0.05. Linear regressions were also performed using log2

296

transform titers and untransformed data from the other variables. We compared antibody titers in

297

pre-pandemic serum samples from individuals who did and did not have a subsequent PCR-

298

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For these analyses we selected serum sample from

299

individuals with RT-PCR negative results matching sex, age, and race for each SARS-CoV-2

300

PCR-confirmed case (RT-PCR positive) to define controls for our cohort. In instances we did not

301

find matched controls, we randomly selected patients with RT-PCR negative test results. We also

302

compared antibody titers in pre-pandemic serum samples among SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed

303

individuals in relationship to hospitalization or need for respiratory support due to COVID-19.

304

Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare the antibody differences for these studies.

305

All the models were adjusted by sex, age, race, and analyses were performed in R21. We

306

compared Log2 transformed antibody titers in COVID-19 hospitalized patients at day 0 and day

307

7. We also compared the fold change in titer by day 7. We compared the fold change in OC43

308

titers between patients who survived and patients who died by day 28 of hospitalization.

samples collected from individuals who later became SARS-CoV-2 infected (cases; n=251) and
those who did not become SARS-CoV-2 infected (controls; n=251). ELISAs were completed to
quantify levels of antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, S-RBD, and N) and the OC43
S protein. Shown are data using samples collected from the entire cohort between August 2013
and March 2020 (A) and samples from a smaller subset of individuals collected between April
2019-Mach 2020 (B). Antibody titers between cases and controls were not significantly different
as determined by unpaired t-tests of log2 transformed antibody titers. Dashed line denotes lower
