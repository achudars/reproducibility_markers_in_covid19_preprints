ABSTRACT
Objective: We sought to characterize clinical presentation and healthcare utilization for pediatric
COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania (PA).

Methods: We established and analyzed a registry of pediatric COVID-19 in Western PA that
includes cases in patients <22 years of age cared for by the pediatric quaternary medical center in
the area and its associated pediatric primary care network from March 11 through August 20,
2020.

Results: Our cohort included 424 pediatric COVID-19 cases (mean age 12.5 years, 47.4%
female); 65% reported exposure and 79% presented with symptoms. The most common initial
healthcare contact was through telehealth (45%). Most cases were followed as outpatients, but
twenty-two patients (4.5%) were hospitalized: 19 with acute COVID-19 disease, and three for
multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-C). Admitted patients were younger
(p<0.001) and more likely to have pre-existing conditions (p<0.001). Black/Hispanic patients
were 5.8 times more likely to be hospitalized than white patients (p=0.012). Five patients (1.2%)
were admitted to the PICU, including all three MIS-C cases; two required BiPAP and one
mechanical ventilation. All patients survived.

Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive snapshot of pediatric COVID-19 disease in an area
with low to moderate incidence. In this cohort, COVID-19 was generally a mild disease;
however, ~5% of children were hospitalized. Pediatric patients can be critically ill with this
infection, including those presenting with MIS-C.

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as
a fatal cause of pneumonia and was quickly recognized as a potentially fatal multisystemic
illness termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)1 It has since caused a pandemic of historic
proportions. The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, in Western
Pennsylvania (PA), was on March 11, 20202 While there have been reports on the course of
acute COVID-19 in pediatric patients in multiple countries3–6 as well as studies detailing
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)7–10 data on pediatric presentation and
severity are still limited. Few published reports of COVID-19 include a comprehensive
description of pediatric clinical presentation in the United States (US). Most pediatric
studies11are case reports or series of relatively few patients, often inpatients, with those with over
100 patients reporting numbers of children infected in a region, but not specifically describing
their clinical characteristics and disease course.11 Many existing studies do not contain childspecific symptom information, often as a result of utilizing ICD code-based retrospective review,
and metrics such as underlying medical conditions and hospitalization information are
limited.6,12,13 In addition, Western PA is representative of a phenomenon seen during the early
days of the pandemic, with transition to a model of healthcare delivery utilizing more telehealth
and fewer in-person visits14 leading to differences in presentation and management of pediatric
patients.14

From the onset of the pandemic in the region, we created a Pediatric COVID-19 Registry,
seeking to characterize the burden of pediatric disease through a collaboration between the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP) and the

affiliated primary care network, Children’s Community Pediatrics (CCP). CHP is a 315-bed
quaternary pediatric care center and admitting hospital that serves a large catchment area,
including Western PA, West Virginia, Eastern Ohio, and Western New York. With over 50
locations, CCP is the largest pediatric and adolescent primary care network in Western and
Central Pennsylvania. CCP provides care in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area located in
Allegheny County, and also in 15 surrounding counties, servicing over 250,000 patients each
year. We included all patients receiving care at these facilities who had a confirmed infection
with SARS-CoV-2. We then performed a registry-based retrospective chart review to
characterize COVID-19 presentation, course of illness, patterns of healthcare utilization, and
short-term outcomes.

METHODS
Case Inclusion and Data Extraction
At the outset of the pandemic in the region, we created the Western PA Pediatric COVID-19
Registry as a secure RedCap database with the goal of adding cases as they arise during the
pandemic and following their course over time15 The registry includes all positive SARS-CoV-2
cases under 22 years of age seen at CHP or at CCP via active surveillance since the first reported
case in the region; for this analysis, we included cases through August 20, 2020, as this was prior
to return-to-school in the region. Subjects are included if they have a positive SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR or if they meet the case definition for MIS-C. At our institution, criteria for MIS-C aligns
with CDC criteria, which include individuals <21 years of age presenting with fever and severe
illness requiring hospitalization; laboratory evidence of inflammation (elevated C-reactive
protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin,

lactic acid dehydrogenase [LDH], and/or interleukin 6 [IL-6]); multisystem organ involvement;
and evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection either by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or
known exposure within the four preceding weeks, without other plausible diagnosis. We
recorded patient demographics, symptoms, healthcare utilization data, laboratory results, and
disease outcomes by reviewing the electronic health records (EHR) at CHP and CCP. If patients
were identified both as outpatient and inpatients, only the inpatient presentation was analyzed.
Patient information was securely handled as approved by the institutional review board at the
University of Pittsburgh (Protocol # STUDY20030250). All data were deidentified prior to
analysis.

Statistical analysis
For cohort description, continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations
unless otherwise stated, while categorical variables are presented as the absolute number in each
category and the proportion (percent) of total. We also analyzed demographic and baseline
differences between cases requiring hospitalization and those managed as outpatients. We
analyzed continuous variables using t-tests and binary/categorical variables using chi-squared
tests or ANOVA. We then performed adjusted analyses using logistic regression models to
evaluate differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients while adjusting for
potential confounders. We considered p-values < 0.05 to be statistically significant. We utilized
GraphPad Prism (version 8.0; GraphPad) and STATA v16 (StataCorp LLC) to conduct analyses
and used packages choroplethr and choroplethrZip in R v4.0.2 / RStudio v1.3.1073 to produce
the choropleth maps.

RESULTS
From March 11 through August 20, 2020, there were 955 confirmed pediatric cases (age 0-19) of
SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, PA, the most populous county in Western PA2; 296 (31.0%)
of them were included in our registry. During that time, the PA Department of Health (DOH)
reported 123,364 total cases in the state, including 10,011 (8.1%) in the 0-19 age group16
Counties represented in our registry reported 18,566 total cases during the study period, or
15.0% of the statewide case burden. While several counties do not report age-specific numbers,
based on those data we estimate approximately 1,503 pediatric patients in the region during the
study period; our registry contains 424 (28.2% of the estimated regional total) and reflects the
numbers of pediatric confirmed infections by date (Figure 1A). Because most pediatric hospital
admissions in the region occur at CHP, our cohort likely includes most hospitalized pediatric
cases. Figure 1B shows the case distribution by zip code in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The
distribution of pediatric cases in the registry (Figures 1D) mirrors that of total RT-PCR
confirmed cases reported by the PA DOH (Figure 1C).

Demographics and presentation to care
All but three cases in the cohort presented with acute disease (99.3%), while remaining cases
presented with MIS-C (0.7%). The mean (SD) age of COVID-19 cases was 12.5 (7.1) years, with
a median [IQR] of 15.5 [5.9-18.4] and a range of 7 weeks to 21.9 years (Table 1, Figure 2);
52.6% of cases were male. In the cohort, 67.2% of cases identified as white, 24.5% as Black,
3.5% as Asian, and ~5.2% as other or not reported; six cases (1.4%) identified as
Hispanic/Latino. Thirty-seven percent of cases reported a preexisting condition; the most

common were asthma (10.6%), neurologic conditions (3.8%), allergic rhinitis (3.5%), cardiac
conditions (3.1%), obesity (1.4%), and diabetes (0.9%) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).
For most cases, initial contact with a healthcare provider was either through telehealth visit
(45.0%) or phone call to their PCP (26.2%), reflecting the rapid change in practice as a response
to the pandemic in our area (Table 2). The CHP Emergency Department cared for 19.8% of
cases, while 3.3% of cases were identified via CHP preprocedural screening, which began in
May 2020.

Exposure and testing
Most cases in the cohort tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal
sample, and two cases of MIS-C had positive IgG serology (Table 2). Most testing was
performed at the UPMC drive-through testing facility (61.3%), followed by testing at CHP
(20.5%). Seventeen cases (4.0%) had previously tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, including
four hospitalized patients: two with MIS-C, one with cystic fibrosis, and one who tested negative
prior to a neurosurgical procedure, then presented with acute COVID-19 one week later.

Most children had at least one known exposure to another person with COVID-19 (65.3%)
(Table 2). The most common exposures were other family members at home (50.9%), peers
(25.9%), and visiting relatives (19.1%). Exposure varied by age group, with the youngest group
(0-2 years) most likely being exposed at home (69.8%), by other family (27.0%), or via childcare
(1.6%); and the young adults (18-21 years) exposed by peers (57.4%), at work (11.8%), or at
bars/restaurants (1.5%) (Figure 2B). Forty-one patients (9.7%) reported travel within the two
weeks prior to presentation of illness, mostly to locations requiring air travel.

For cases with available dates of exposure, on average (SD), there were 4 (4.6) days from
exposure to symptom onset, 2.5 (3.1) days from symptom onset to health care presentation, and
1.7 (3.2) days from presentation to testing; total interval from symptom onset to testing was 3.7
(3.8) days (Table 2, Figure 3 A-D).

Symptoms
Approximately 79% of patients presented with symptoms, the most common being fever
(42.5%), cough (37.0%), rhinorrhea (30.7%), pharyngitis (20.3%), headache (18.6%), fatigue
(13.4%), myalgias (13.2%), and ageusia (11.6%) (Table 3). No patients reported chilblains or
“COVID-toes.” When evaluated by age, those in the youngest group (0-2 years) were more
likely to present with fever, cough, and rhinorrhea than older children (p<0.005) (Figure 4).
Older children were more likely to have more numerous symptoms (p=0.001). Twenty-one
percent of cases in the cohort were asymptomatic and were identified through testing after a
known exposure (70.5%), pre-procedural screening at CHP (15.9%), or via testing required to
return to school or sports (10.3%) (Supplementary Table 2).
Severe disease
Most cases with acute COVID-19 were treated as outpatients and recovered at home (95.4%),
but 22 required hospital admission: nineteen with acute disease and three with MIS-C. Fifteen
patients were hospitalized for management of acute COVID-19 symptoms, while the others were
admitted for other medical problems and were found to be positive during evaluation. Patients
with chronic medical conditions were more likely to be hospitalized than those without
significant past medical history (10.8% vs 1.9%, p<0.001). Hospitalized patients were

significantly younger than those followed as outpatients (7.2 [7.4] vs 12.8 [7.0] years, p<0.001),
with the youngest age group representing 45.5% of hospitalizations (Table 4). Black/Hispanic
patients were more 5.8 times more likely to be admitted than non-Hispanic white patients (12.0%
vs 2.9%, respectively; OR=5.8 [95%CI=1.5-22.8] after adjusting for age, chronic conditions, and
the number of days between symptom onset and testing; p=0.012). Hospitalized patients were
more likely to present with fever, dyspnea, wheezing, chest pain, hyporexia, vomiting,
abdominal pain, or diarrhea (p<0.05).

Among hospitalized patients, five were admitted to the PICU; two for acute disease requiring
BiPAP and three for MIS-C. There were no differences in age between PICU and non-PICU
patients (p=0.11), but all five PICU cases were Black or Hispanic. Average length of stay (LOS)
was 2.2 (2.9) days for patients admitted to the floor vs. 9.4 (3.9) days for PICU patients
(p<0.001).
Most patients admitted received radiographic studies, including chest X-ray (11), chest CT (1),
or echocardiograms (2). Five chest X-rays were reported as abnormal and showed increased
interstitial markings (4), lobar consolidation (1), and/or multifocal opacities (1). Treatment
included supportive care (14), albuterol (3), and one patient each received remdesivir, IV
steroids, oral steroids, and empiric antibiotics (Table 4). All patients were discharged home and
there were zero deaths.

MIS-C
Three patients during the study period were admitted to the PICU for MIS-C, with an average
length of stay of 11.3 (4.0) days (range 9-16 days) (Table 4). Two patients were male; two

identified as Black and one as Hispanic white. Mean age was 8.8 (1.4) years (range 7.5-10.3
years). All were otherwise previously healthy. All had normal chest X-rays, and all received
echocardiograms, of which one demonstrated ventricular dysfunction with coronary dilatation.
All MIS-C patients were treated with IV steroids and immunoglobulin; one received remdesivir
and two received anakinra. Two required inotropic support. All patients were ultimately
discharged home and there were no deaths.

DISCUSSION
In this report, we provide a comprehensive clinical description of pediatric COVID-19 in
Western PA, a region with a low to moderate case burden. We describe clinical presentation and
healthcare utilization for the breadth of pediatric disease, ranging from asymptomatic patients
identified on preprocedural screening to critically ill patients with the presentation of either acute
COVID-19 or MIS-C. Due to the market capture of the participating institutions, we are able to
provide a sampling of cases that likely mirrors all pediatric disease in the area, with a bias toward
inclusion of children who require hospitalization or intensive care. These cases span the date
range of March to August 2020, a period in which all schools were closed to in-person learning
in our area.

The demographics of our cohort mirror some national trends, demonstrating that Black and
Hispanic adults 17,1819 and children 20,21 are more likely to be infected with or have worse
outcomes from COVID-19. According to the most recent available census data22 the largest
ethnic groups in Allegheny County, PA, are non-Hispanic whites (79.9%) followed by nonHispanic Blacks (13.4%). While our registry encompasses an entire region of the state and not

solely this county, Black patients are overrepresented among infected children (24.5% of patients
in the registry). While the total number is small, all individuals who presented with MIS-C were
from minority groups, which also aligns with prior reports23,24. Racial/ethnic differences in
hospitalization risk remained significant after accounting for age, sex, the presence of chronic
conditions, and the time lapse between symptom onset and COVID-19 testing.

This study also highlights, as is true for many pediatric conditions, that symptoms of SARSCoV-2 infection vary with the age of the child. The youngest children were more likely to
present with fever, cough, and rhinorrhea than older children, who more frequently presented
with a syndrome of more numerous symptoms that may not include fever. Evaluating children,
particularly in the outpatient setting, through this lens can be beneficial in recognizing potential
SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as it presents with symptoms similar to other respiratory
viral pathogens25.

Based on the data in our area, we estimate a prevalence of MIS-C of approximately 2.0 per 1,000
SARS-CoV-2 pediatric infections. However, this is likely an overestimate, since children can
have asymptomatic disease (up to 2.2% of well-children based on all comers for pre-procedure
screening26), and thus symptom-based screening likely excludes some infected patients. In
addition, our center receives transfers for more severe disease in the region, including MIS-C.
Other estimates of MIS-C prevalence have ranged from a nationwide rate of 2.0 per 1,000
(694/355,123)27 to the PA statewide rate of 4.3 per 1,000 (43/10,011)16.
Another important observation during this study is the rapid rise in the rate of telehealth
appointments. While CCP did not routinely use telemedicine prior to this pandemic, they rapidly

adapted to being able to provide care and counseling (especially for patients with respiratory
symptoms), monitor patients, and arrange for SARS-CoV-2 testing at an off-site drive-through
testing facility to decrease exposure risk in their offices. Several subspecialty disciplines also
moved the majority of routine outpatient encounters to virtual visits within days of the first case
detected in the region. Telehealth will continue to play an important role in pediatric healthcare
delivery as we move into the winter respiratory illness season, when SARS-CoV-2 will be
circulating in addition to other typical winter viruses such as influenza and RSV. This will also
be crucial given the additional burden placed on outpatient healthcare providers who are being
asked to provide clearance for ill children to return to school in the era of COVID-19.

This study has several strengths. Our registry is based on information abstracted directly from
the EHR by providers involved in the care of these children, which provides more detailed and
accurate information than reports based on ICD-10 codes or claims data. We were therefore able
to break down patterns by age group. The registry cohort represents a wide range of SARS-CoV2 pediatric clinical presentations outside of a pandemic “hotspot”; disease severity is thus less
likely affected by strain on the system or difficulties accessing care. Our results advance prior
pediatric literature showing higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in minority children to show
that these children are also at higher risk of severe disease, as has been reported in adults. At the
same time, we must acknowledge study limitations. First, given the scope of practice at our
referral center, we cannot rule out bias towards more severe disease; however, most cases were
detected and followed as outpatients at CCP. Second, the current report does not yet include
long-term patient outcomes and, thus, these data provide a limited understanding of patient
recovery or long-term sequelae. However, this real-time registry will allow for additional follow-

up on these metrics. We can use this tool to measure how dynamics of the outbreak in the
pediatric population change with added factors in the coming months, including changes in child
behavior with the school year, the respiratory virus season, and hopefully the eventual
introduction of vaccines.

In summary, this report provides a comprehensive overview of the breadth of presentation of
pediatric infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a single geographic area. In general, pediatric patients
tolerate this infection well, with only a small proportion (~5%) requiring hospital admission, and
even fewer (~1.2%) presenting with critical illness. Large, multicenter collaborative efforts will
be crucial to better understand factors associated with severe pediatric SARS-CoV-2 disease,
particularly in racial and ethnic minorities at higher risk.
