ABSTRACT

27

SARS-CoV-2 was reported to the WHO as an outbreak in Wuhan City, China on end of 2019,

28

afterwards pandemic on the worldwide in 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is less deadly, but far

29

more transmissible. Therefore, it needs to detect and monitor quickly and simply on site to

30

prevent SARS-CoV-2.

31

If detecting coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the real-time RT-PCR method is sensitive

32

and specific for the unique target, however, it must take long time and labour that RNA is

33

treated in advance, transcribed and amplified. Therefore, referenced previously report, in this

34

study, we modified various methods to prove hypotheses the followed.

35

Firstly, we hypothesized that real-time RT-PCR could be finished in very short time by the

36

mobile real-time PCR device and one-step RT-PCR reagent. Secondly, we hypothesized that it

37

was possible to perform RT-PCR utilizing the reagent as the above without RNA treatment in

38

advance so called “direct”.

39

Firstly, it was able to detect the positive control RNA of SARS-CoV-2 for less than 13.5

40

minutes by primer-probe referring to the CDC. Moreover, each detection value varied in

41

accordance with each concentration (This correlation coefficient R2 > 0.95). Secondary, it was

42

possible to detect human coronavirus 229E with direct RT-PCR. Furthermore, each detection

43

value varied in accordance with each titer (TCID50 / mL) of human coronavirus 229E (This

44

correlation coefficient R2 > 0.95).

45

Considering the above, causing by utilizing the mobile real-time PCR device and the one-step

46

real-time PCR reagent simultaneously following as: 1) It was possible to detect SARS-CoV-2

47

in very short time as compared to conventional method; 2) It was possible to detect human

48

coronavirus quickly and simply with “direct”. For these reasons, we hypothesized that it is

49

possible to detect SARS-CoV-2 quickly and simply by utilizing methods the above without

50

treating RNA in advance. This hypothesis is our next try.

INTRODUCTION

61

Severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a cause of coronavirus

62

disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, of which the World Health Organization (WHO) declared

63

pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. COVID-19 was firstly reported to the WHO as an outbreak

64

in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 31, 2019, afterwards has rapidly spreading

65

[2]. SARS-CoV-2 included, human infectious coronaviruses have been known seven types.

66

Four of the seven types (HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63) are

67

included among the known causes of common cold. Whereas, other three human coronaviruses

68

(the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV], SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2)

69

are highly pathogenic and can cause severe diseases presented as acute respiratory distress

70

syndrome (ARDS) characterized by dysfunctional immune responses and severe pulmonary

71

injury [3, 4]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is genetically closely related to SARS-CoV, but which is

72

less deadly and far more transmissible than MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV [5]. Therefore, it has

73

been needed with rapidity and on site to detect and monitor.

74

The conventional method of confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 is based on detection of sequences

75

unique in the virus RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as real-time reverse3

76

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The viral genes targeted so far include the

77

nucleocapsid (N), envelop (E), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), spike (S), and open

78

reading frame 1 a/b (Orf1a/b), each of which primer and probe is various sequences [6, 7, 8, 9,

79

10, 11]. We recognize that the performance characteristics of PCR methods can vary with

80

reagents, PCR programs, and devices. Therefore, if devices or reagents changed, with simpler

81

and faster, it might be possible to detect.

82

Further, in quantitative RT-PCR, RNA extraction is required, followed by transcription,

83

amplification and detection. Current RT-PCR typically require more than 60 minutes for RNA

84

extraction, concentration and purification, and a further 90 minutes for transcription and

85

amplification [12]. It is difficult to handle RNA not to be damaged and lost, possible to infect

86

secondary and needed long time to detect. This might be due to the delay of the initial

87

introduction of RT-PCR detection for SARS-CoV-2 in various places.

88
89

As already reported rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 with using mobile real-time PCR device
PCR1100 [10], we suggest “simpler and faster” method of RT-PCR in this paper as follows.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primer and Probe

93

Based on previously reported protocols of NIID [6, 7] and CDC [8, 9], and detection of

94

HCoV-229E [13], PCR primers and probes for real-time RT-PCR detection were selected to

95

target each N gene, and synthesised (Fasmac Co. Ltd., Japan) (Table 1).

100

were synthesised (Fasmac Co. Ltd., Japan) based on each primer sequence and information

101

of GenBank: MN997409.1 (Table 2).

102

Each positive control RNA was applied 10-fold serial dilution with 10mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0

103

adjusted from 1M [Nippon Gene Co. Ltd., Japan] with water [UltraPure™ DNase / RNase-

104

Free Distilled Water, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA]) included 10μg / mL carrier RNA

105

(Ribonucleic acid from baker's yeast, Merck KGaA, Germany). Further, each concentration

106

of positive control RNA was assessed relatively with detection value of PCR1100.

107

The above, exposure to HCoV-229E is low-risk for healthy adults. The HCoV-229E virus

108

is easily accessible for the biosafety level 2 (BSL2) laboratory. Therefore, HCoV-229E may

109

be a good initial model for the evaluation against other coronaviruses, such as SARS-COV-

110

2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 [14]. There we substituted HCoV-229E for SARS-

111

2-CoV in direct RT-PCR. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E, VR-740™) was bought

112

by certified non-profit organization biomedical science association in Japan (BMSA) from

113

American Type Culture Collection (ATCC®, USA), afterwards, in cooperation of BMSA, it

114

was able to be used. Because to proliferate HCoV-229E, it was infected with MRC-5 cells

115

(CCL-171™, ATCC®), and cultured with EMEM medium (30-2003™, ATCC®) included

116

2% FBS (30-2020™, ATCC®) for 5~8 days in 5% CO2 at 35 °C. When virus titer was grown

117

up 8.9 x 10^6 Median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50 / mL), only that supernatant

118

without MRC-5 cells was stored at -80 °C before the assay. The supernatant included HCoV-

119

229E was thawed in the assay, not treated in advance and used with crude as it was. To assess

120

detection value of PCR1100 relative with titer of virus, the crude sample was applied 10-fold

121

serial dilution with 10mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0, the above).

124

RT and PCR were carrying out in the one-step with using mobile real-time PCR device

125

PCR1100 for all tests of this study. Briefly describe the composition of RT-PCR reagent, 1 μL

126

of a sample (the crude or positive control RNA) was amplified in a 17 μL reaction solution

127

containing 1x Reaction Buffer, 0.25 μL of RT Enzyme Mix, 1.0 μL of DNA Polymerase

128

(THUNDERBIRD® Probe One-step qRT-PCR Kit, TOYOBO Co. Ltd., Japan), each final

129

concentration of primer and probe for target detection (Table 2). With preliminary tested, each

130

composition optimized (data not shown).

131

The RT-PCR conditions applied in this study were programmed as follows: RT incubation

132

and enzyme activation were serially performed at 50 °C for 150 seconds, at 95 °C for 15

133

seconds respectively. Afterwards, for SARS-CoV-2 against NIID version: thermal cycling was

134

then performed at 95 °C for 3.5 seconds (denaturation), and at 60 °C for 16 seconds (annealing

135

and amplification) for fifty cycles. For SARS-CoV-2 against CDC version: thermal cycling

136

was then performed at 95 °C for 3.5 seconds (denaturation), and at 60 °C for 7 seconds

137

(annealing and amplification) for fifty cycles. For HCoV-229E: thermal cycling was then

138

performed at 95 °C for 3.5 seconds (denaturation), and at 60 °C for 8 seconds (annealing and

139

amplification) for fifty cycles. With preliminary tested, each condition was optimized (data

140

not shown).

141

Incidentally, the procedure of PCR1100 was according to previously reported [15].

RESULTS
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in positive control RNA

145

In NIID version, both No.1 and No.2 could be simultaneously detected with multichannel

146

(Fig 1). As the result previously reported [7], No.2 was detected more sensitive than No.1,

147

possible to determine 10 copies too. Each Ct value (detected on the PCR1100) was depended

148

on the rate of dilution (No.1:R2 = 0.9982, No.2:R2 = 0.9969). When simultaneously detecting

149

with two kinds of primer / probe sets, accuracy of results could be provided with higher

150

reliability. It took only about 20 minutes per detection on the PCR1100 with using one step

151

RT-PCR reagent (THUNDERBIRD® Probe One-step qRT-PCR Kit). So, it could be to detect

152

10 copies of positive control RNA only in 20 minutes.

153

In CDC version, also, CDC No.1 and CDC No.2 could be detected with multichannel (Fig

154

2). Both No.1 and No.2 were detected in same sensibility, and possible to detect 10 copies

155

too. Furthermore, each Ct value (detected on the PCR1100) was depended on the rate of

156

dilution (No.1: R2 = 0.9996, No.2: R2 = 0.9983). As the same of NIID version, when

157

simultaneously detecting with two kinds of primer / probe sets, accuracy of results could be

158

provided with higher reliability. Furthermore, it took only about 13.5 minutes per detection

159

on the PCR1100 with using the same one step RT-PCR reagent, that was even faster

160

compared with NIID version. It could detect with at least10 copies of positive control RNA,

161

besides it took only in 13.5 minutes.

162
163

Detection of HCoV-229E in crude state

164

Crude sample of HCoV-229E was applied 10-fold serial dilution, afterwards without

165

treatment in advance and with one step RT-PCR reagent (THUNDERBIRD® Probe One-step

166

qRT-PCR Kit) was tested in the RT-PCR on the mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100. As

167

the result, without treatment for extraction, concentration and purification of RNA, it was

168

possible to detect HCoV-229E at least 8.9 x 102 TCID50 / mL (Fig 3). Furthermore, each Ct

169

value (detected on the PCR1100) was depended on the rate of dilution, that is, virus titer (R2

170

= 0.9949). Ct value might be relatively indicated to virus titer.

171

Also, it took only about 13 minutes per detection on the PCR1100 with using one step RT-

172

PCR reagent the same above of SARS-CoV-2. On another real-time PCR device using normal

173

two steps RT-PCR, it needed more than 90 minutes.

174

Therefore, it would be able to omit more than 135 minutes (60 minutes for RNA treatment,

175

75 minutes for RT-PCR) in total in detection of RNA virus compared with other current

176

methods.

177
178

DISCUSSION

179

Previously reported [10, 15, 16], with using the mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100, it

180

could be to detect unique strain rapidly, and sensibility and specificity are equivalent to other

181

devices. However, it would take 15 minutes at least to conclude RT-PCR for detection of unique

182

RNA in any case. Furthermore, it was necessary for RNA in advance to adjust with extraction,

183

concentration and purification.

184

First, this study addressed it to optimize each composition and PCR program according to

185

previously reported [7, 10], a part of which modified to quickly carry out RT-PCR for detection

186

of SARS-CoV-2 with using the mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100. With especially the

187

unit of reverse transcriptase enzyme decreased and the time of reverse transcription shorted,

188

sensibility of detection was improved (data not shown). Furthermore, as one step RT-PCR

189

reagent, THUNDERBIRD Probe One-step qRT-PCR Kit (TOYOBO) was used, of which was

190

possible and efficiently to carry out RT and probe’ real-time PCR simultaneously. This time,

191

NIID and CDC version were selected for detection of SARS-CoV-2, both of which were unique

192

for N-gene of SARS-CoV-2 and used in general [7, 8, 9]. As a result, in the NIID version No.2,

193

CDC version No.1 and No.2, it was possible quantitatively to detect 10 copies or more of

194

positive control RNA with using mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100. However, in the NIID,

195

No.1 was able to detect only 100 copies or more, so No.2 was more sensitive than No.1 by 10

196

times. These results were about equal to previously reported [7, 10], that is, it might mean this

197

method to be right adequate to detect positive control RNA for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, in

198

both of CDC version by multichannel method, RT-PCR run could be finished in less than 14

199

minutes. That is, after RNA finished of extraction from each sample, this device would be

200

quickly able to discriminate presence of target. This faster RT-PCR might be caused by

201

combination of PCR1100 with RT-PCR reagent, of which was possible and efficiently to carry

202

out RT and PCR simultaneously. However, regretfully, in our situation unable to deal with

203

SARS-CoV-2, this method couldn't be demonstrated possible or not for genome RNA as

204

reported previously [7, 10]. Furthermore, primer / probe sets unique for gene of SARS-CoV-2

205

has been variously developed till now, so we would like to investigate about those sets if RT-

206

PCR is able to be faster to more in the PCR1100.

207

Second, we tried it to modify total system to detect SARS-CoV-2 easier. When treatment in

208

advance for RNA (mainly extraction, concentration and purification) it was required more than

209

60 minutes [12, 13, 17]. Therefore, in this study, we tried it to carry out RT-PCR without

210

treatment of RNA in advance, so that, direct RT-PCR. We tested for direct RT-PCR, in that

211

was used THUNDERBIRD® Probe One-step qRT-PCR Kit as one step RT-PCR reagent. With

212

above, this reagent was possible and efficiently to carry out RT and probe' real-time PCR

213

simultaneously, furthermore as reason, described possible to NAAT from crude samples [18].

214

Additionally, because of our situation unable to deal with SARS-CoV-2, therefore we

215

substituted HCoV-229E, low-risk for healthy, for SARS-2-CoV in direct RT-PCR this time. As

216

a result, surprisingly, without treatment for extraction, concentration and purification of RNA,

217

it was possible to detect HCoV-229E at least 8.9 x 102 TCID50 / mL. Furthermore, Ct value

218

could be relatively to virus titer. This time, Lower Limit of Detection (LoD) couldn't show

219

accurately because failed to measure less than 8.9 x 102 TCID50 / mL. However, as approximate

220

curve shown (y = -4.004x + 46.61), the LoD is supposed to less than 1 TCID50 / mL. Also, it

221

took only about 13 minutes per detection on the PCR1100 with using one step RT-PCR reagent

222

the same above of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it would be able to omit more than 135 minutes

223

(60 minutes for RNA treatment, furthermore, 75 minutes for RT-PCR) in total in detection of

224

SARS-CoV-2 compared with other current methods. Already some reported direct RT-PCR for

225

SARS-CoV-2, it was necessary for especial reagent and additional treatment duration to direct

226

RT-PCR [12, 19, 20, 21, 22]. So, we could suggest novel method in this paper, in which used

227

PCR1100 device and commercial one step RT-PCR reagent only. However, our method must

228

be assessed in real SARS-CoV-2, further validated using clinical specimens, which contained

229

nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum. Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR reliable in saliva reported

230

[23, 24], its specimen must be assessed too. On the other hand, if low virus in air could be

231

collected, it might be able to detect quickly and easily on site by our novel method, and the

232

result be following prevent from droplet infection.

233

Although the other four community-acquired HCoVs (229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63) are a

234

common cause of common cold only, they are thought to cause pandemics and major outbreaks

235

of probably more severe respiratory diseases when they initially crossed species’ barriers to

236

infect humans decades and centuries ago [3, 25]. That is, it would be possible new coronaviruses

237

to transfer again, therefore we are exposed to dangerous forever. On that time, the mobile real-

238

time PCR could be it save time compared to earlier detection methods. Furthermore, we think

239

that methods suggested in this paper should be suitable for various strains and it to be useful.

240
241

STUDY DESIGN

242

When each sample was assessed in the real-time RT-PCR, a ten-fold dilution series of each

243

was indicated with high relativity to Ct value on the mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100

244

(R2 = 0.99).
