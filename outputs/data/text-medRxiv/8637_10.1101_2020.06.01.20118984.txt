Abstract

19

Airborne transmission is a recognized pathway of contagion; however, it is rarely quantitatively

20

evaluated. This study presents a novel approach for quantitative assessment of the individual

21

infection risk of susceptible subjects exposed in indoor microenvironments in the presence of an

22

asymptomatic infected SARS-CoV-2 subject. The approach allowed the maximum risk for an

23

exposed healthy subject to be evaluated or, starting from an acceptable risk, the maximum

exposure time. We applied the proposed approach to four distinct scenarios for a prospective

25

assessment, highlighting that, in order to guarantee an acceptable individual risk of 10-3 for

26

exposed subjects in naturally ventilated indoor environments, the exposure time should be

27

shorter than 20 min. The proposed approach was used for retrospective assessment of

28

documented outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou (China) and at a choir rehearsal in Mount

29

Vernon (USA), showing that, in both cases, the high attack rate values can be justified only

30

assuming the airborne transmission as the main route of contagion. Moreover, we shown that

31

such outbreaks are not caused by the rare presence of a superspreader, but can be likely

32

explained by the co-existence of conditions, including emission and exposure parameters, leading

33

to a highly probable event, which can be defined as a “superspreading event”.

1. Introduction

39

The airborne transmission of a virus and the consequent contagion risk assessment is a complex

40

issue that requires multidisciplinary knowledge. It is necessary to understand the characteristics

41

and mechanisms behind the generation of respiratory microdroplets

42

microdroplets 3, the transport of microdroplets and human exposure to them 4, and the airflow

43

patterns that carry microdroplets in buildings 5. Expiratory human activities generate virus-

44

carrying microdroplets that are small enough to remain aloft in air during exhalation, talking, and

45

coughing 2,6,7. Atomization occurs in the respiratory tract, and droplets are expelled at high speed

46

during expiration

early investigations

49

spatial visualization methods using high-speed cameras 14, particle image velocimetry 8 and, above

50

all, increasingly accurate particle counters 6, which have facilitated the detailed characterization

51

and quantitation of droplets expelled during various forms of human respiratory exhalation flows.

52

The issue of the viral load emitted, however, remained difficult to solve. In the past, backward

53

calculation was used to estimate the emission of an infected subject based on retrospective

54

assessments of infectious outbreaks only at the end of an epidemic 15–18. This led to the definition

55

of emission values for each virus regardless of the type of respiratory act and the metabolic

56

activity of the infected subject. Recently, the authors presented an approach to evaluate the viral

57

load emitted by infected individuals with a view to provide new predictive capacities, not currently

58

available 19. This approach, based on the oral viral load and the infectivity of the virus, takes into

59

account the effect of other parameters such as inhalation rate, type of respiratory activity, and

60

activity level, to estimate the quanta emission rate. This value provides key information for

61

engineers and indoor air quality experts to simulate airborne dispersion of diseases in indoor

62

environments. Indeed, the use of exposure risk models in closed environments

63

possible to estimate contagion starting from the emission values of a contagious subject.

64

The overall approach of emission and exposure modelling represents an essential tool to be

65

applied in enclosed spaces, and can support air quality experts and epidemiologists in the

66

management of indoor environments during an epidemic for both prospective and retrospective

67

assessments.

68

In this paper we apply a novel approach that takes into account the characteristics of the emitting

69

subject, the microenvironment, and the exposed subject to calculate the probability of infection

70

and the individual risk, for both prospective and retrospective assessments of airborne infectious

71

transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In the case of prospective assessment, various exposure scenarios in

11–13

served as a foundation for subsequent studies involving temporal and

72

indoor environments were analyzed in order to assess the influence of risk mitigation parameters.

73

In the case of retrospective assessment, we estimated the probability of infection and the

74

individual risk of two documented outbreaks.

75

2. Materials and methods

76

To evaluate both prospective and retrospective assessments of the airborne transmission of SARS-

77

CoV-2, we used a four-step approach to quantify the probability of infection, i.e. the ratio between

78

infected cases and the exposed population due to exposure in a microenvironment where a SARS-

79

CoV-2 infected subject is present. The four steps of the proposed approach are: i) evaluation of

80

the quanta emission rate; ii) evaluation of the exposure to quanta concentration in the

81

microenvironment; iii) evaluation of the dose of quanta received by an exposed susceptible

82

subject; and iv) estimation of the probability of infection on the basis of a dose–response model.

83

The simulations of the probability of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were performed

84

applying a Monte Carlo method

85

implemented to evaluate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and to predict the risk

86

of these diseases to the public 17,20,21.

87

Once the probability of infection was obtained, an approach to evaluate the individual infection

88

risk, i.e. a parameter that also takes into account how likely the probability of infection can occur,

89

was also implemented. Individual risk can be easily compared to an acceptable risk, i.e. a target

90

reference risk that could be suggested by agencies and regulatory authorities to control the

91

pandemic. In the following sections, the methodologies adopted to evaluate the probability of

92

infection based on the four step approach (section 2.1) and the individual infection risk (section

93

2.2) are described. The application of the proposed approach for prospective and retrospective

94

assessments is described in sections 2.3 and 2.4.

. Further they adopted the infection risk assessment typically

emission rate of an infectious subject on the basis of the viral load in the sputum and the

airborne droplet nuclei required to infect a susceptible person. The quanta emission rate (ERq,

101

quanta h-1) was evaluated as:

where cv is the viral load in the sputum (RNA copies mL-1), c is a conversion factor defined as the

105

ratio between one infectious quantum and the infectious dose expressed in viral RNA copies, IR is

106

the inhalation rate (m3 h-1), Nd is the droplet number concentration (part. cm-3), and Vd(D) is the

107

108

of the droplets (Vd) is determined on the basis of data obtained experimentally by Morawska et al.

110

With reference to the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the mouth, researchers have recently found cv

111

values of up to 1011 copies mL-1, which is also variable in the same patient during the course of the

112

disease

113

transmission appears to have occurred during the incubation period in the index patient. A high

114

viral load of 108 copies mL-1 was found, confirming that asymptomatic persons are potential

115

sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, Pan et al. 23, in a study on 82 SARS-CoV-2 infected

116

patients, found cv values in the range of 108–109 RNA copies mL-1, also in the previous days and in

117

the first days of onset of the disease. Consequently, the concentrations of the viral load in the

118

mouth can reach values of 109 RNA copies mL-1and occasionally up to 1011 RNA copies mL-1 during

119

the course of the disease.

120

The conversion factor, ci, i.e. the ratio between one infectious quantum and the infectious dose

121

expressed in viral RNA copies, barely represents the probability of a pathogen surviving inside the

122

host to initiate the infection; thus ci=1 implicitly assumes that infection will occur for each

123

pathogen (RNA copy in the case of SARS-CoV-2) received by the exposed people. There are

124

currently no values available in the scientific literature for ci for SARS-CoV-2. Watanabe et al.

125

estimated the infectious doses of several coronaviruses on the basis of data sets challenging

126

humans with virus HCoV-229E (known as an agent of human common cold) and animals with

127

other viruses (e.g. mice with MHV-1, considered as a surrogate of SARS-CoV-1). On the basis of the

128

orders of magnitude of the infectivity conversion factors for the overall data sets, we assumed a ci

129

range between 0.01 and 0.1.

130

The quanta emission rate calculation was performed for four different emission profiles (which are

131

adopted in the risk evaluations described later) evaluated as a combination of expiratory activities

132

and activity levels: (i) oral breathing during resting; (ii) oral breathing during heavy activity; (ii)

133

speaking during light activity; and (iv) singing (or loudly speaking) during light activity.

134

Quanta emission rates were calculated using eq. (1) and applying a Monte Carlo method 22 in order

135

to take into account for the possible variation of the input data. To this end, probability density

136

functions characteristics of each parameter were considered. In particular, we considered normal

137

distributions for: (i) the log-transformed cv data (average and standard deviation of log10(cv) equal

138

to 8 and 0.7 log10 (RNA copies mL-1), respectively); and (ii) the infectious dose ci (average and

139

standard deviation equal to 0.025 and 0.125, respectively). A distribution of quanta emission rates

140

(ERq), was obtained as a result of application of the Monte Carlo method (Figure 1), i.e. the

141

probability density function of ERq (pdfq).

2.1.2 Evaluation of the exposure to quanta concentration

143

The second step in evaluating the probability of infection is evaluation of the quanta

144

concentration to which a susceptible subject is exposed. The quanta concentration at time t, n(t),

145

in an indoor environment is based on the quanta mass balance proposed by Gammaitoni and

146

Nucci 20, and can be evaluated as:

where IVRR (h-1) represents the infectious virus removal rate in the space investigated, n0

150

represents the initial number of quanta in the space, I is the number of infectious subjects, V is the

151

volume of the indoor environment considered, and ERq is the quanta emission rate (quanta h-1) for

152

the specific disease/virus under investigation. The quanta concentration calculation adopted here

153

is based on the following hypotheses: the quanta emission rate is considered to be constant, the

154

latent period of the disease is longer than the time scale of the model, and the droplets are

155

instantaneously and evenly distributed in the room 20. The infectious virus removal rate is the sum

156

of three contributions

157

surfaces (k, e.g. via gravitational settling), and the viral inactivation (λ). The deposition rate was

158

evaluated as the ratio between the settling velocity of super-micrometric particles [roughly

159

160

source (1.5 m); thus, k was 0.24 h-1. The viral inactivation was evaluated on the basis of the SARS-

161

CoV-2 half-life (1.1 h) detected by van Doremalen et al.3, thus λ was 0.63 h-1.

162

In the exposure scenarios tested with the prospective and retrospective approaches, to take the

163

variability of the input parameters into account, the indoor quanta concentration n(t) was

164

determined through eq. (2), applying a Monte Carlo method that adopted the probability density

functions (pdfq) characteristic of quanta emission rates (ERq). Since the probability density

functions of the log-transformed log10(ERq) for the different expiratory activities resulted in a

167

normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test, p < 0.01), the quanta concentration n(t) was evaluated by

168

providing a Gaussian distribution of log10(ERq) (average and standard deviation values are is

169

summarized in the results section; see Table 2) and then applying a back-transformation from

170

log10(ERq) to ERq. The relative frequency at which a certain quanta concentration occurred for each

171

time step of simulation, i.e. the probability density function of the quanta concentration (pdfn),

172

was also obtained as result of the Monte Carlo simulations.

173

2.1.3 Evaluation of the dose of quanta received by an exposed susceptible subject

174

The dose of quanta received by a susceptible subject exposed to a certain quanta concentration,

175

n(t), for a certain time interval, T, can be evaluated by integrating the quanta concentration over

176

time as:

(3)

179

It can be concluded from Eq. (3) that the dose of quanta received by a susceptible subject is

180

affected by the inhalation rate (IR) and subsequently by their activity level. As an example, for the

181

same exposure scenario [i.e. identical n(t) and T], the dose of quanta received by subjects

182

performing at a light activity level (IR = 1.38 m3 h-1; e.g. slowly walking) is more than double that

183

received by people just sitting or standing (IR = 0.54 m3 h-1). For the dose, in the exposure

184

scenarios described in this paper, the Monte Carlo method was applied to eq. (3) considering the

185

probability density function of the quanta concentration (pdfn), whereas the IR was considered as

186

a constant value; thus, the probability density function of the dose (pdfD) was obtained for each

187

time step of the simulation.

188

2.1.4 Evaluation of the probability of infection through a dose–response model

189

The fourth and final step in evaluating the probability of infection is the adoption of a dose–

190

response model. Several dose–response models are available in the scientific literature for

191

assessing the probability of infection of airborne-transmissible pathogens

192

deterministic and stochastic models, and threshold and non-threshold models.

193

The best-suited dose–response models for airborne transmission of pathogens are the stochastic

194

models. In particular, exponential models have been mostly adopted in previous studies because

195

of their suitability and simplicity 27. Such models consider the pathogens as discrete bundles (i.e.

196

quanta) distributed in a medium (e.g. saliva/sputum) in a random manner described by the

197

Poisson probability distribution. When the medium is aerosolized, the pathogen distribution in the

198

aerosols, and hence their distribution in the air, also follows the Poisson probability distribution.

199

The complex Poisson summation equations can be simplified in an exponential equation 17,27,30, i.e.

200

the exponential dose–response model, which evaluates the probability of infection, PI (%), of

201

susceptible people as:

(4)

204

For a unit dose of quanta (D = 1), the probability of infection PI is equal to 63%, from which

205

derives the definition of “quantum” as the “amount of infectious material to infect 1-e-1 (i.e. 63%)

206

of the people in an enclosed space” 13,20.

207

In the exponential dose–response model, the variation of host sensitivity to the pathogen is not

208

considered. More complex models, such as the Beta-Poisson probability distribution, could take

209

this factor into account

210

population in terms of susceptibility to the virus will not be considered.

; nonetheless, in the present paper the differences in the exposed

211

The probability of infection PI evaluated in the following exposure scenarios was determined

212

through eq. (4), also applying a Monte Carlo method. To this end, the probability density functions

213

of the dose of quanta (pdfD) obtained as a result of the Monte Carlo simulation on D were

214

considered; thus, a probability density function of PI was also obtained (pdfP).

215

The probability of infection represents the ratio between the number of infection cases (C) and

216

the number of exposed susceptibles (S). In retrospective analyses of documented outbreaks, the

217

known C/S ratio is typically defined as the “attack rate”.

218

2.2

219

As stated above, the probability of infection (P ) is the expected number of infection cases in

220

relation to the number of exposed susceptibles (C/S ratio). However, based on eqs. (2-4), such

221

probability is strongly influenced by the probability density function of the dose (pdfD), which is

222

influenced in turn by the probability density function of the quanta concentration (pdfn) and by

223

the probability density function of the quanta emission rate (pdfq). In other words, for a given

224

exposure scenario (microenvironment, ventilation, inhalation rate of the exposed subject, etc.) the

225

probability of infection (P ) can assume different values on the basis of the rate of quanta emitted

226

by the infected subject: the lower the quanta emission rates, the lower the probability of infection

227

(since all the other parameters affecting the exposure were considered to be constant values).

228

Thus, when evaluating the individual risk (R) of an exposed person, we should know both the

229

probability of infection (PI) and the probability of occurrence of such a PI value (PP). The latter is

230

defined by the probability density function pdfP. Since the probability of infection (PI) and the

231

probability of occurrence PP are independent events, the individual infection risk, R, can be

232

evaluated as the product of the two terms:

235
236

The probability density function of the individual risk, pdfR, can be obtained by multiplying all the

237

possible PI values obtained from the application of the Monte Carlo method to the four-step

238

approach by the corresponding probability of occurrence. The maximum value of R in eq. (5), i.e.

239

the mode of the pdfR, is of particular interest because it represents the most probable individual

240

risk for a healthy subject or, in other words, the highest probability of being infected. In a

241

conservative application of the proposed approach to estimate and reduce the risk of individuals

242

being together with an infected individual in an indoor environment, the maximum individual

243

infection risk must be less than an acceptable risk.

244

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) typically uses a target reference risk range of 10-4

245

to 10-6 for carcinogens in drinking water 31, which is in line with World Health Organization (WHO)

246

guidelines for drinking water quality, which base guideline values for genotoxic carcinogens on the

247

upper bound estimate of an excess lifetime cancer risk of 10-5 32. If the estimated lifetime cancer

248

risk is lower than 10-6, the risk is considered acceptable, while risks above 10-4 are considered

249

unacceptable 33.

250

The choice of an acceptable contagion risk for SARS-CoV-2 is difficult and certainly questionable.

251

However, considering the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2, this turns out to be an order of magnitude

252

lower than the corresponding value associated with carcinogenic diseases. For this reason, only for

253

discussion purposes, the value of 10-3 is taken as an acceptable risk reference for SARS-CoV-2.

254

For the purpose of managing an epidemic and keeping the infection under control, it is also

255

important to estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection, R0, which is calculated as

256

the ratio between the number of susceptible people infected (C) and the infected subject (I). Thus,

257

R0 can be easily evaluated by multiplying the infection probability, P , by the number of exposed

258

susceptible individuals (S). To control an epidemic, the R0 value must be less than 1. Therefore, in

259

addition to estimating an acceptable individual infection risk, it is necessary to specifically verify

260

that, with the crowding expected within the environment, the corresponding value of R0 is less

261

than 1.

263

The proposed four-step approach was applied to different indoor microenvironments by varying

264

the main parameters in order to evaluate the effect of the influencing parameters. In particular,

265

four emission profiles of the infected subject 6 and corresponding profiles of the healthy subjects

266

exposed were chosen. For the sake of simplicity, the simulations were run assuming that the

267

susceptible subjects remained in the microenvironment for the same length of time as the

268

infected subject (i.e. the two subjects enter and leave the environment under test together). Each

indoor environment under investigation was tested for three different values of air exchange rate

270

(AER). Table 1 presents a detailed summary of the four different indoor exposure scenarios

271

considered to evaluate the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Scenario A consists of a

272

hospital room of 100 m3 where a resting infected patient emits quanta in the room through oral

273

breathing, whereas the exposed susceptible subjects consist of a member of the medical staff in a

274

light exercise activity (scenario A-1) and another patient at rest (scenario A-2). In scenario B, the

275

infection affects two subjects, both oral breathing during a sports activity in a 300 m3 gym.

276

Scenario C concerns two subjects (infected and healthy) in light activity while speaking in a generic

277

300 m3 office (bank, post office, supermarket, shop, etc.). Finally, scenario D represents an

278

infected subject singing or speaking loudly in an 800 m3 room with healthy subjects listening at a

279

sedentary activity level.

Retrospective assessments: outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, and at choir

283

2.4.1 The outbreak in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China

284

A possible case of airborne transmission was recently documented by Lu et al.34. Here, an index

285

case patient traveled from the Chinese epidemic epicenter, Wuhan, on 23 January 2020 and ate

286

lunch in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, with his family on 24 January 2020 (family A, 10 people

287

sitting at the same table). Later that day, the index patient experienced onset of fever and cough

288

and SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. On the following days, nine other people were

289

diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection: four members from family A’s table and five other people at

290

two different tables (families B and C). No other customers seated at other tables or waiters were

291

infected.

292

The restaurant is a 5-floor building without windows; each floor has its own air ventilation system.

293

The third floor dining area, at which the index patient ate lunch, has a floor area of 145 m2, with

294

15 tables arranged with a distance between each table of about 1 m. A total of 91 people (83

295

customers, 8 staff members) were in the room during that lunch. The exposure time was variable

296

for the customers: those seated at tables close to the index patient had exposure times of

297

53 minutes (family B) and 73 minutes (family C). The ventilation and air conditioning situation is

298

reported in Lu et al.34. Five fan coil air-conditioning units are installed in the room and there is no

299

outdoor air supply; thus, the ventilation relies only upon infiltration and natural ventilation. The

300

authors performed computational fluid dynamics analyses and tracer gas decay tests to obtain

301

more information about the possible air-flow pathway in the room, and to determine the air

302

exchange rate expected during that lunch. The analyses performed showed that, due to the

303

particular installation and use of the fan coils, the room can be divided into different air-flow

304

zones, with well-mixed conditions. The air-flow zone involving the table at which the index patient

305

sat also included the two tables at which the other five infected people sat; and covered an area

306

of roughly 45 m3. The tracer gas decay tests revealed a low air exchange rate (mostly due to the

307

absence of an outdoor air supply) in the range of 0.56–0.77 h-1.

308

Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the retrospective assessment was applied to

309

this outbreak case, through eqs. (2) and (3), using the following input data: i) room volume of

310

45 m3; ii) documented probability of infection, i.e. attack rate, of 45% (i.e. 5 out of 11 people of

311

families B and C (family A members were excluded as they could easily have been infected through

312

other infection routes); iii) average exposure time of 1 h; iv) speaking at a light activity level for all

313

people (both emitting and exposed subjects), and v) average AER = 0.67 h-1.

2.4.2 The outbreak at a choir rehearsal in Skagit (USA)

315

A further possible case of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was documented by the USA

316

media (www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-29/coronavirus-choir-outbreak). This case

317

was recorded on 10 March, in Mount Vernon (Skagit County, Washington State, USA). In a 810 m3

318

hall, 61 choir members (out of a total of 121 regular members) gathered to rehearse, aware of the

319

practices for the containment of contagion (frequent hand washing and social distancing). None of

320

the members that attended had evident symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was hand

321

sanitizer at the front door and members refrained from the usual hugs and handshakes; each

322

person brought their own sheet music. The event lasted from 6:30 pm to 9:00 pm (about 2.5

323

hours). Within few days, 33 of the 61 participants (53%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2

324

infection, at least three were hospitalized, and two died 35.

325

As pointed out by Hamner et al.35, the 2.5-hour singing practice could have provided several

326

opportunities for droplet and fomite transmission (e.g. members sitting close to one another,

327

sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice). Nonetheless, the abovementioned

328

voluntary measures put in place would not support the documented spread of the contagion. On

329

the contrary, the act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of

330

aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization 19. This is even more relevant considering

331

that attack rate of 53.3% (based on 33 confirmed cases) could represent a conservative estimate,

332

since other 20 probable cases were mentioned by Hamner et al.35.

333

As regard the heating and ventilating system, limited information is available: the Fellowship Hall

334

is heated by a relatively new commercial forced-air furnace with supply and return air grills

335

situated high on a single wall. The furnace is installed to have both make-up and combustion air,

336

but it is not known how much fresh air was provided on that evening. During the entire rehearsal

337

no exterior doors were open. We applied a retrospective assessment to the case of the Skagit

3. Results and Discussions

342

3.1

343

Figure 1 and Table 2 show the statistics relating to the quanta emission rates for the four emission

344

profiles considered in section 2.1. As shown in Buonanno et al.19, there are large differences

345

between the emission profiles. Obviously the lowest values are found under the oral breathing

346

condition during resting (median value of 0.36 quanta h-1), followed by the oral breathing

347

condition during heavy activity as the inhalation rate increases (2.4 quanta h-1), and reaching 4.9

348

quanta h-1 for the increase in aerosol emitted during vocalization

349

singing/speaking loudly (31 quanta h-1). Indeed, the rate of particle emission during normal human

350

speech is positively correlated with the amplitude of vocalization 36.

351

The probability density functions of the quanta emission rates (Pq) were also determined. In

352

particular, the log-transformed ERq values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations resulted in a

353

normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test, p < 0.01). Table 2 shows the average and standard

354

deviation values of the log10(ERq).

355

We point out that the estimated values present two main uncertainty contributions clearly related

356

to the limited data currently available for the SARS-CoV-2: i) a still low number of experimental

357

data for the viral load in the mouth, cv, of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, ii) unavailable infectivity

358

conversion factors, ci, for SARS-CoV-2; indeed, as mentioned in the methodology section, the ci

359

parameter was estimated on the basis of data available for other coronaviruses challenging

360

humans (only in the case of HCoV-229E) and animals (for all other types of coronavirus).

Risk management in prospective assessment applications

3.2.1 Illustrative example of probability of infection and individual risk evaluation

369

In Figure 2 an illustrative example of quanta concentration n(t), dose of quanta (Dq), and

370

probability of infection (PI) trends as a function of time (here shown for 2 h) resulting from the

371

Monte Carlo simulation for exposure scenario D (singing exhibition, conference speaker) with an

372

AER = 0.5 h-1 is shown. In particular, the trends of different percentiles are reported. The example

373

shows that a person singing/speaking loudly in such a microenvironment can lead to a median n(t)

374

value after 2 hours equal to 0.027 quanta h-1 (with a 5th–95th percentile range of < 0.002–

375

0.38 quanta h-1). Such concentrations lead to a median dose of quanta received by the subject

376

exposed for 2 h in a sedentary activity equal to 0.029 quanta (with a 5th–95th percentile range of

377

< 0.002–0.42 quanta), then resulting in a median probability of infection, PI, of 2.8% (with a 5th–

378

95th percentile range of 0.2%–33.0%). Thus, if higher quanta emission rates are considered, the

379

indoor quanta concentrations and the consequent probability of infection can be more than 10-

380

fold the median values.

. Different percentiles are reported.

386

In view of the application of a conservative approach that could be essential to reduce the risk of

387

contagion in indoor environments, using the highest quanta concentration and probability of

388

infection values can be misguiding. Indeed, the probability of occurrence of such high values is

389

extremely low. Thus, as described in section 2.2, a proper evaluation of the individual infection risk

390

(R) can be obtained by applying eq. (4), i.e. multiplying the probability of infection (PI) by the

391

corresponding probability of occurrence (PP). In Figure 3 the probability density functions of

392

individual infection risk (pdfR), probability of infection (pdfP), quanta concentration (pdfn), and

393

dose of quanta (pdfD) after 2 hours of exposure are reported (in terms of R, PI, n and Dq values for

394

each percentile) for the illustrative example discussed above (i.e. scenario D, AER = 0.5 h-1). The

395

individual infection risk (R) presents a maximum value (Rmax) at the 85th percentile (2.2%) due to a

396

probability of infection PI = 14.5% and a probability of occurrence PP = 15%. In other words, the R

397

value at the 85th percentile is the most probable individual infection risk for a healthy susceptible

398

subject (i.e., the one with the highest chance of occurring). Due to the similarity of the probability

399

density functions of the four expiration activities resulting from the calculation of the quanta

400

emission rates (log10(ERq) reported in Table 2), the pdfR for all the exposure scenarios tested here

401

was similar to that of the exposure scenario shown in Figure 3 (i.e. the Rmax value occurs in the

402

narrow range of 84th–90th percentile).

403

Furthermore, as discussed in section 2.2, the probability density function of the probability of

404

infection (pdfP) is mostly influenced by the probability density function of the quanta emission rate

405

(pdfq) when moving backwards in the four-step approach; indeed, once the exposure scenario is

406

defined, all the parameters contributing to the calculation of PI (ventilation, room volume, subject

407

activity, etc.) can be considered as constant values. Thus, for a simplified estimate of Rmax, the

408

simplest calculation can be applied (instead of the Monte Carlo method) by just adopting the 85th

409

percentile of the quanta emission rate in the four-step calculation using eqs. (2-4).

418

Figure 4 and Table 3 show the results of the Monte Carlo simulations for the four exposure

scenarios analyzed. The exposure time–risk relationships reported in Figure 4 are essential as they

420

can be used by choosing either the exposure time or the maximum risk Rmax as the independent

421

variable. In the first case, knowing the exposure time of the healthy subject in the environment in

422

question, the corresponding individual infection risk can be evaluated and then compared to an

423

acceptable infection risk. In the second case, once an acceptable infection risk has been imposed,

424

the corresponding maximum exposure time value can be easily assessed. The four scenarios are

425

examined assuming an acceptable risk value of 10-3 as discussed in section 2.3. Since the maximum

426

value of individual risk occurs roughly at the 90th percentile, the corresponding probability of

427

occurrence of the risk (PP) is 10%; thus, an acceptable individual infection risk of 10-3 will roughly

428

correspond to a probability of infection of PI = 1%. For indoor environments characterized by high

429

crowding indexes a PI < 1% is essential as it can assure a R0 < 1 when crowded with up to 100

430

people. Therefore, assuring an individual infection risk of 10-3 also guarantees the control of the

431

epidemic with an R0 < 1 for a maximum number of exposed healthy people S < 100.

432

For the exposure scenario discussed above (scenario D, AER = 0.5 h-1) the maximum exposure time

433

to reach an accepted risk of R = 10-3 is very short (16 min); this is due to the high viral load emitted

434

during singing or speaking loudly leading to high quanta concentrations despite the large volume

435

available. Obviously, the exposure time can increase with higher ventilation rates, e.g. reaching

436

38 min in the case of mechanical ventilation at 10 h-1. The crowding index of such an indoor

437

environment (800 m3) ranges from 0.75 m2 (auditorium) to 2 m2 (conference room) per person 37;

438

thus, for a room height of 4 m a corresponding floor area of 200 m2 will be available, then

439

resulting in a total number of people simultaneously present in the room (S) ranging from 100

440

(conference room) to 267 (auditorium). Therefore, after 16 min of exposure in the case of natural

441

ventilation (or 38 min in the case of mechanical ventilation with AER = 10 h-1), the value of R0 will

442

be higher (auditorium) or equal (conference room) to 1. Thus, in the management of the

443

epidemic, reducing the crowding index could be essential. Accepting higher Rmax values would

444

clearly increase the maximum exposure time; indeed, in the case of Rmax = 10-2, the exposure time

445

values would be 62 min and 392 min, for an AER equal to 0.5 h-1 and 10 h-1, respectively. However,

446

in this case, the corresponding value of R0 would be lower than 1 only for a number of exposed

447

subjects lower than 10.

448

In scenario C, the infected subject in light activity speaks in a 300 m3 environment, along with the

449

healthy subject. The simultaneous reduction of both the quanta emission rate and the volume

450

compared to scenario D makes the maximum exposure times for an acceptable infection risk of 10-

451

3

452

respectively). Additionally, in this case, the estimated exposure times would guarantee an R0 < 1

with S < 100 subjects.

rate (0.5 h

, 3 h

, and 10 h

) for the exposure scenarios investigated in the prospective approach and

458

summarized in Table 1.

459

In scenario A (patient emitting at rest in oral breathing), the maximum exposure time in a hospital

460

room of 100 m3 for both a medical staff member (scenario A-1) and a patient at rest without

461

infection (scenario A-2) is evaluated. In both cases the exposure times increase significantly with

462

the ventilation rate, reaching 36 min and 157 min (scenario A-1), and 72 min and 455 min

463

(scenario A-2) with AER values of 0.5 h-1 and 10 h-1, respectively. However, despite the small size

464

of the room, the ERq was extremely small (Table 2); thus, unless a large number of infected

465

subjects is simultaneously present in the room, the concentration of viral load in a hospital room

466

can be considered low; nonetheless, the overall risk may become relevant due to the long

467

exposure times (of 36 and 157 min). Finally, in exposure scenario B (the gym with infected and

468

healthy subjects during heavy activity with oral breathing), although there is no vocalization in the

469

subject's activity, the high inhalation rate produces considerable ERq values, then increasing the

470

individual risk; thus, in order to guarantee an acceptable infection risk of 10-3 the maximum

471

exposure times resulted quite short, i.e. 14 min and 29 min for 0.5 h-1 and 10 h-1, respectively.

472

Thus, for all the scenarios investigated, the ventilation conditions strongly influence the risk (or

473

the exposure time) of the exposed subject: this difference increases as the accepted risk increases

474

as shown in the trends presented in Figure 4. In contrast, if a lower risk was accepted (i.e. 10-4 or

475

10-5), increasing the air exchange rate is not leading to the significant reduction of the risk, and

476

local exhaust ventilation would be more effective.

maximum individual infection risk (Rmax).

Retrospective assessment application: the outbreaks in a restaurant in Guangzhou and at a

480

choir rehearsal in Skagit Valley

481

Figure 5 shows the trends of quanta concentration and probability of infection (PI) evaluated for

482

the retrospective cases defined in section 2.4 (a restaurant in Guangzhou and the Skagit Valley

483

choir). The retrospective analysis applied to the restaurant in Guangzhou (Figure 5a) revealed that,

484

under the boundary conditions considered in the simulation (in terms of room volume, ventilation,

485

number of exposed people; see section 2.4.1), a probability of infection (PI) after 1 hour of

486

exposure equal to the attack rate (45%) can be reached for a quanta emission rate of

487

ERq = 61 quanta h-1. This emission rate, for an emitting subject speaking during light exercise,

488

occurs at the 93rd percentile of the probability density function of ERq (Pq).

489

Similarly, for the retrospective analysis applied to the Skagit Valley choir (Figure 5b), in order to

490

reach an attack rate of 53% after 2.5 hours of exposure under the simulation boundary conditions

491

reported in section 2.4.2, a quanta emission rate of 341 quanta h-1 is needed. Additionally, in this

492

case, such an emission rate occurs at the 92nd percentile of the probability density function (Pq) of

493

an infected subject while singing.

494

Therefore, for both the analyzed cases in the retrospective analyses, the required ERq values to

495

obtain the documented Re fall perfectly within the possible values of the emission profiles under

496

consideration (i.e. speaking and singing/speaking loudly in light activity reported in Table 2).

497

Moreover, such emission values incur high individual infection risks as they are around the 90th

498

percentile, i.e. at the percentile maximizing the individual infection risk (Rmax). Indeed, the R values

499

for the restaurant at Guangzhou and the Skagit Valley choir were 3.2% and 3.7%, respectively –

500

more than one order of magnitude higher than the acceptable risk of 10-3. In these two cases, an

501

individual risk of < 10-3 would have been obtained with a probability of infection PI = 1.3-1.4%:

502

such a PI is not actually achievable by varying and optimizing the room ventilation (e.g.

503

AER > 100 h-1 would be required), and is achievable only by reducing the exposure time of the

504

susceptible subjects and the quanta emission rates.

Figure 5 – Quanta concentration (n) and probability of infection (PI) evaluated for the retrospective cases

applied at the documented outbreaks at (a) the restaurant in Guangzhou and (b) the Skagit Valley choir.

508

To summarize, the retrospective assessment of the two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks investigated

509

demonstrate that the documented number of infected people can be explained by means of the

510

airborne transmission route; indeed, the most probable of the expected events occurred. The

511

approach and consequent calculation reported here clearly highlights that the explanation of such

512

a high number of infected people does not necessarily require the presence of a superspreader in

513

the environment (i.e. an infected person with the highest viral load, cv, and infectious dose, ci), but

515

highly probable event, which can be defined as a “superspreading event”.
