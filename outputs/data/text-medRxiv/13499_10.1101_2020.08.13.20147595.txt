ABSTRACT
Background: When available, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be deployed to countries with limited
immunization systems.
Methods: We conducted an immunization capacity assessment of a simulated WHO African Region
country using region-specific data on immunization, population, healthcare workers (HCWs), vaccine
cold storage capacity (quartile values for national and subnational levels), and characteristics of influenza
vaccines to represent future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses,
doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns
targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines.
Findings: Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by
27.0% for ≥65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse
density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for ≥65 years,
99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African
Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level
storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries.
Interpretation: In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially
increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines.
Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national-level stores already at their limits, but
sufficient capacity exists at subnational levels. Immediate attention to strengthening immunization
systems is essential to support pandemic responses.

BACKGROUND
There is a robust pipeline of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in various stages of preclinical and clinical
development [1, 2]. While the challenges of developing a vaccine at an accelerated timeline for this
newly-emerged pathogen have been well described [2], less attention has been given to the challenges of
vaccine deployment and delivery. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, vaccine deployment to
many developing countries was suboptimal. In a survey about the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response
published in 2013, WHO African Region (subsequently called “African Region”) countries reported 62%
overall utilization of the 32,096,290 deployed H1N1 vaccine doses [3, 4], covering approximately 1% of
the region’s population [4]. Most of these vaccine doses arrived after June 2010, despite the fact that
H1N1 vaccines were prequalified by WHO for procurement beginning November 2009 [3]. This delay,
largely due to obstacles in vaccine deployment and delivery, resulted in many preventable illnesses.
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already caused more severe health impact than the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
[5], and national governments, and technical and partner agencies aspire to higher population coverage
than what was achieved during the prior pandemic [4, 6, 7]. A WHO report following the 2009 H1N1
pandemic concluded that existing health systems, immunization infrastructures, and deployment training
played key roles during the vaccine response [8]. Critical to immunization infrastructure is the cold chain,
defined as the series of actions and equipment necessary to maintain a vaccine within a specific low
temperature range from production to the point of administration. While the number of deployed H1N1
vaccine doses covered only a fraction of at-risk populations identified, 29% of countries of the African
Region reported having insufficient cold chain and logistics capacity for a comprehensive pandemic
response [4].
Since 2014, a concerted global effort has improved cold chain infrastructure in developing countries [9,
10], which may facilitate a more rapid, widespread, and equitable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response. We
undertook this study to investigate the impact SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs would have on vaccine

delivery and storage systems in the African Region. Our goal was to assess the operational feasibility of
mass vaccination programs targeting SARS-CoV-2 risk groups.
METHODS
This analysis is similar to cold chain capacity assessments that are performed routinely by countries in
preparation for new vaccine introductions [11]. We aimed to explore African Region-level operational
concerns of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine implementation. We did not, however, intend for our analysis to take
the place of country-level assessments using national contexts and data for deployment planning. Rather
than describe any individual country or countries, we simulated a 20 million population country using the
2017 age distribution for the African Region [12]. We compared the number of doses and vaccine storage
volumes required for routine immunization alone and with SARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination campaigns.
We then compared the required vaccine storage volumes for both scenarios to actual vaccine cold storage
capacities from countries in the African Region. Our outcomes of interest included the monthly
percentage increases in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold
storage volume requirements for SARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination campaigns compared to routine
immunization baselines.
Immunization strategies
We used a standard routine immunization schedule for the simulated country based on current WHO
policy recommendations (Table 1) [13]. We then adopted a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign strategy
targeting the following risk groups: persons aged ≥65 years, persons with certain chronic medical
conditions (chronic diseases), healthcare workers (HCWs), and all risk groups combined [7]. We assumed
the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would span four months in duration and would require two
doses, one month apart. To determine the fraction of the population in the chronic diseases group, we
applied WHO-recommended [14], age-based estimates of comorbid risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2
illness specific to the African Region [15]. Comorbidities included chronic cardiovascular, respiratory,

neurologic, kidney and/or liver diseases; diabetes; cancers; HIV/AIDS; tuberculosis; and sickle cell
disorders [15]. For HCWs, we used WHO estimates of skilled health personnel for the African Region,
distributing these workers evenly across ages 20 through 64 years [16]. For the all risk groups combined
category, we assumed HCWs had the same prevalence of chronic diseases as the general population and
adjusted to avoid double counting.
Vaccine storage
We identified WHO prequalified routine vaccine products [17], and we recorded the cold storage volumes
required per dose for the standard routine immunization schedule (Table 1). We prioritized ten-dose vials
for the schedule whenever they were available, choosing the product with the median secondary
packaging volume if there were multiple prequalified ten-dose vial products. As no licensed SARS-CoV2 vaccines are available, we adopted a proxy of cold storage volumes required for WHO prequalified
influenza vaccines in ten-dose vials chosen similarly [17]. Cold storage volume is the total volume of
vaccines maintained at refrigerated temperatures throughout storage and transport. Cold storage in
countries is organized by levels, with the national level being where procured vaccines are received and
stored before distribution to subnational levels (region, district, and health facility). Vaccines (and
diluents, for reconstituted products) are produced by the manufacturer in vials or other primary packaging
that are then packed together in labeled boxes called “secondary packaging” [17]. Products in secondary
packaging are packed in cartons called “tertiary packaging” [17]. Vaccines are typically maintained in
tertiary packaging at the national level [18]. Tertiary packaging volumes per dose are often around ten
times the secondary packaging volumes per dose due to additional insulation and thermal packaging
materials. At subnational levels, packaging materials are removed and vaccines are stored in their
secondary packaging [18, 19]. Cold storage temperature for routine vaccines is typically 2° to 8°C,
although some more thermostable products are becoming available [17]. Vaccine vials used in most
developing countries carry individual thermo-chemical temperature monitors that indicate when a vial has
been outside of the recommended storage temperature range and should be discarded [20, 21].

Vaccine delivery
We estimated vaccine storage volumes using WHO tools and guidance [11, 17, 19, 20, 22]. We compared
routine immunization to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns according to evidence-based assumptions
about vaccine wastage (doses that are damaged or unused) [23], reserve stock (excess supply in case of
increased demand or stock outs) [11, 20, 24], and resupply intervals (Table 2) [22]. In the case of SARSCoV-2 vaccines, we assumed 7.5% wastage, 0% reserve stock, and monthly resupply intervals given
anticipated high global demand and limited supply. We received summary vaccine cold storage capacity
data from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for African Region countries that are eligible to receive Gavi
support. These data included the minimum, 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, and upper
range values of total country storage capacities, as well as the median proportion of national-level stores
and health facility-level stores to total country capacity. For comparisons, capacity data were standardized
by dividing the total cold storage capacity by the population of children aged < 2 years in each country.
Analysis
We calculated the monthly doses and cold storage volumes required for routine immunization programs
and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns to reach 90% of target populations [19]. We developed a
vaccine flow-down schematic (Supplemental Figure 1) to depict the quantity of routine vaccine doses
maintained at each immunization system level by month under normal circumstances and used it to
calculate the total quantity of vaccine doses and their storage volumes at each level. To assess the
feasibility of storing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, we compared the anticipated vaccine volumes for routine
immunization and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns to actual vaccine cold storage capacities at
national and subnational levels under normal circumstances. We defined “immunization program
workloads” as the doses delivered per vaccinator. To determine this, we calculated the number of monthly
doses for each activity divided by the estimated number of vaccinators available in the country. We
obtained estimates of the number of nurses for countries from a WHO Workforce Database [16], and we
calculated nurse density per 10,000 population using 2017 country population estimates [12]. We

determined the values for 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, and upper range nurse density for
African Region countries, and we determined median values for other WHO Regions. To assess the range
of immunization program workloads that would be experienced across the African Region, we applied the
different nurse density estimates to the simulated country. We multiplied each nurse density estimate by
46%, the proportion of nurses estimated to provide immunization services [16, 25]. We assumed a 3%
baseline absenteeism and an additional 8% absenteeism for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic months [26, 27]. To
place results within the global context, we compared these results to calculations using the median
number of vaccinators per capita from other WHO regions, while maintaining all other parameters
unchanged. For the monthly comparisons and time series, we assumed constant routine immunization
demand throughout the year and constant SARS-CoV-2 immunization demand during a mass vaccination
campaign of four months duration. We performed all analyses using standard spreadsheet software
including the made-for-purpose “WHO Vaccine Volume Calculator 2012” (Microsoft Corp, Redmond,
WA, US) [28]. The WHO Vaccine Volume Calculator is designed to estimate the net storage volume of
vaccines per child. Its specific purpose is to analyze how changes to the national immunization program
schedule will affect cold chain capacity. As there was no involvement of human participants or personal
identifiable information, institutional review board approval was not required.

RESULTS
Description of population and vaccination target groups
We simulated a country of 20 million people in the African Region (Table 3). The percentage of the total
population within each risk group was 3.1% for persons ≥65 years, 10.4% for persons with chronic
diseases, 0.1% for HCWs, and 11.8% for all risk groups combined.
Vaccine doses

As in most developing countries, all routine vaccination services in the simulated country would be
received by children aged <5 years and 9 through 14 years. Assuming systems would also be in place to
provide immunization services to HCWs, established routine immunization platforms would reach 31.0%
of the national population. A total of 1,020,931 routine vaccine doses would be given each month. Each
month during the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, 275,313 doses would be delivered targeting
persons ≥65 years, 935,878 targeting persons with chronic diseases, 11,511 targeting HCWs, and
1,058,536 targeting all risk groups combined (Table 4 and Figure 1). Targeting SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
of risk groups would increase monthly doses administered over the routine immunization baseline by
27.0% for persons ≥65 years, 91.7% for persons with chronic diseases, 1.1% for HCWs, and 103.7% for
all risk groups combined.
Immunization workload
Using the median value of nurse density from countries in the African Region (6.9 per 10,000
population), we estimated 13,840 nurses in the simulated country, of which an estimated 6,366 (46%)
would provide vaccination services. Accounting for baseline and pandemic absenteeism, one vaccinator
would administer 165.3 routine doses per month at baseline and 179.7 routine doses per month during the
pandemic (Table 4).
During the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign, the number of persons vaccinated monthly per
vaccinator would be 48.5 targeting persons ≥65 years, 164.7 targeting persons with chronic diseases, 2.0
targeting HCWs, and 186.3 targeting all risk groups combined. Compared to routine vaccines given at
baseline, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of risk groups would increase the immunization program workload
for vaccinators by 29.3% for persons ≥65 years, 99.6% for persons with chronic diseases, 1.2% for
HCWs, and 112.7% for all risk groups combined. Due to nursing personnel shortages in the African
Region, the immunization program workload would be substantially lower if nurse density were similar to
other WHO Regions. Repeating the analysis using nurse density estimates from other WHO Regions (but
maintaining all other parameters unchanged), the immunization program workload would increase by

26.9% using estimates from the Americas, 36.6% using estimates from the Eastern Mediterranean, 10.4%
using estimates from Europe, 42.2% using estimates from South-East Asia, 19.8% using estimates from
the Western Pacific, and 24.3% using global estimates (with the relative proportion changes being the
same regardless of risk group) (Supplemental Table 2 and Figure 2).
We repeated the workload analysis using quartiles and upper range estimates for nurse density from
countries in the African Region (while maintaining all other parameters unchanged). For each nurse
density value, we estimated the following number of vaccinators: 25th percentile: 4,177; 50th percentile:
6,366; 75th percentile: 12,654; and upper range value: 62,957 (Supplemental Table 3 and Supplemental
Figure 4). The 75th percentile nurse density estimate (13.8 per 10,000 population) was still lower than all
other WHO Region nurse density estimates (with the closest being South-East Asia at 16.4 per 10,000
population). The upper range value (68.4 per 10,000 population) exceeded the nurse density estimate for
all other WHO Regions (i.e. higher than the 66.5 per 10,000 population estimate for the European
Region). Additional monthly doses per vaccinator for SARS-CoV-2 risk groups ranged from 4.9-73.9
targeting persons ≥65 years, 16.7-251.1 targeting persons with chronic diseases, 0.2-3.1 targeting HCWs,
and 18.8-284.0 targeting all risk groups combined.
Routine vaccine storage
We applied standardized African Region vaccine cold storage capacity range and quartiles to the
simulated country. The total storage capacity would range from 38,403 L to 1,605,826 L, and nationallevel storage capacity would range from 12,535 L to 524,141 L (Table 5). We assessed the storage
capacity during the month with the highest vaccine volumes. Using the vaccine flow-down schematic and
adding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign during months 9 through 12, the maximum vaccine
volumes were during month 10 for the national level and month 11 for the subnational levels
(Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). We found that the maximum monthly routine vaccine volumes for the
national level would be 139,161 L and for the aggregate subnational levels would be 57,472 L. At the
national level, only the highest value capacity estimate had sufficient cold storage capacity to

accommodate all routine vaccines according to our vaccine storage assumptions. Routine vaccine
volumes exceeded that available at the national level for at least 75% of African Region country storage
capacities (Figure 3). At subnational levels, substantial excess available space existed for all capacities
assessed, indicating that subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for
at least 75% of countries (Figure 4).
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine storage
We estimated the volume required to store SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in tertiary packaging at the national
level and in secondary packaging at subnational levels (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3). At the national
level, monthly SARS-CoV-2 vaccines would occupy 2,137 L for persons ≥65 years, 7,264 L for persons
with chronic diseases, 89 L for HCWs, and 8,216 L for all risk groups combined (Table 5). Excluding the
lowest range value for country capacity, the percentage of total national-level stores displaced by these
vaccines by quartile of African Region country capacities ranged from 0.4% to 3.8% for persons ≥65
years, 1.4% to 12.9% for persons with chronic diseases, <0.1% to 0.2% for HCWs, and 1.6% to 14.5% for
all risk groups combined (Table 5 and Figure 3). At the subnational levels, monthly SARS-CoV-2
vaccines targeting risk groups would occupy 1,598 L for persons ≥65 years, 5,433 L for persons with
chronic diseases, 67 L for HCWs, and 6,145 L for all risk groups combined. The percentage of
subnational-level stores displaced by these vaccines by quartile of African Region country storage
capacity ranged from 0.1% to 6.2% for persons ≥65 years, 0.5% to 21.0% for persons with chronic
diseases, <0.1% to 0.3% for HCWs, and 0.6% to 23.8% for all risk groups combined (Table 5 and Figure
4).
DISCUSSION
We used WHO tools and guidelines to estimate the operational impact of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
campaign in the African Region [17, 22]. While we simulated a country of 20 million population for this
analysis, we used actual immunization, population, healthcare worker density, and cold storage capacity

data available for the region. As no SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently licensed [1], we assumed a two
dose vaccine series, multidose vials, and vaccine storage and volume characteristics similar to influenza
vaccines.
Our analysis revealed that the national-level storage capacity would be insufficient to accommodate
additional SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for a vaccination campaign targeting risk groups as large as persons
≥65 years (3.1% of the population) in at least 75% of African Region countries. However, all African
Region countries likely have sufficient subnational-levels storage capacity to accommodate SARS-CoV-2
vaccines for mass vaccination campaigns. This means that there is insufficient excess cold storage
capacity at the national level, whereas once vaccines are distributed to subnational levels in the health
system there should be adequate storage capacity. This bottleneck in the vaccine cold chain at the national
level can be addressed in advance by decreasing reserve stocks, shortening supply intervals, removing
products from tertiary packaging earlier in the chain, distributing vaccines to the subnational levels,
and/or installing or leasing more refrigeration capacity. However, implementation of SARS-CoV-2
vaccination campaigns will also require increases in accompanying dry goods, such as syringes, safety
boxes, cotton, alcohol, and personal protective equipment, necessitating additional planning and budget
for operations and waste management. More in-country vaccine shipments will be required to distribute
routine and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines if transportation capacities are not increased, adding costs and
logistical challenges. Care should be taken not to disrupt routine vaccine supply and distribution, as
stockouts of routine vaccines will exacerbate national immunization programs already impacted by the
pandemic.
While we found that the aggregate subnational-level storage capacities are adequate for SARS-CoV-2
vaccines, with very large margins expected for a majority of countries, it should be noted that it is not
possible nor practical to fill all available subnational-level storage capacity. For example, at the health
facility level, standard vaccine refrigerators may have multiple times the capacity needed for vaccines
used at that facility, but that excess capacity cannot be easily used to store vaccines for other facilities.

The complicated logistics of fully utilizing the available storage capacity at the lower levels of the cold
chain makes it impractical. Nevertheless, our findings show that there is ample vaccine storage capacity
available at subnational levels, and creative management of both routine and campaign vaccines could
leverage some of that excess capacity during the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign period.
Another major obstacle for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine delivery in the African Region will be the availability
of qualified vaccinators. The African Region has the smallest health workforce of any WHO Region [16],
and the workload required to vaccinate risk groups would increase by 27.0% for persons ≥65 years and
91.7% for persons with chronic diseases, compared to routine immunization baselines. SARS-CoV-2
vaccination activities targeting HCWs will require less additional workload given their small population
size and ease of access to vaccination services. Our analysis highlights the need for significant planning,
and investment in equipment, training, and logistics for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment.
There is reason for optimism that the African Region SARS-CoV-2 vaccination response will be much
improved from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic experience. Over the last ten years, a concerted global effort has
greatly improved cold chain infrastructures and increased storage capacity [9, 10]. Furthermore, countries
in the African Region have successfully implemented mass vaccination campaigns with several different
vaccines. From 2010-2017, the MenAfriVac introduction strategy targeted all persons aged one through
29 years in 23 Meningitis Belt countries [29]. From 2010-2011, six West African countries implemented
mass vaccination campaigns achieving 98% coverage in the target population [29]. Over a ten-day period
in Burkina Faso, a team of 5,328 vaccinators and as many volunteers vaccinated 11,425,391 persons
(73% of the country population) [29]. The lyophilized vaccine was supplied in 10-dose vials, requiring
reconstitution [17]. Each vaccinator vaccinated an average of 214 persons daily. The Region has had
many other successful vaccination campaigns in the last decade, as well, including with vaccination
against polio, measles, and yellow fever [30-33]. The impact on cold storage and workforce is also likely
to be reduced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine supply limitations, as WHO is currently planning for an initial
tranche of vaccines to cover 3% of a country’s population [34]. With sufficient planning and resources,

success could be achieved for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs targeting much higher proportion of a
country’s population.
A SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would be greatly facilitated if vaccine delivery were simplified
[21]. While a one dose vaccine would be ideal, initial Phase 1 data indicate that two doses will likely be
needed [2]. Nasal spray or transdermal patch vaccines that could be administered by trained lay persons
would free skilled health workers to provide other essential services, but no such vaccines are currently in
human trials [1]. While single dose vial vaccine presentations limit vaccine wastage [4, 20], and prefilled
syringe presentations limit wastage and greatly simplify administration [20], their cold storage volumes
per dose make these presentations highly problematic for use in mass vaccination campaigns in the
African Region. For influenza vaccines (our proxy for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in this analysis), secondary
and tertiary packaging volumes per dose for multidose vials (5.4 mL and 7.2 mL) [17] are much lower
than for single dose vials (median of WHO prequalified products: 18.4 mL and 87.3 mL) [17] and
prefilled syringes (Flublok® Quadrivalent: 86.5 mL and 111.8 mL) (personal communication Global
Medical Information, Sanofi Pasteur Inc).
WHO has advised that certain products would be challenging to include in national immunization
schedules if they do not meet specific Programmatic Suitability Criteria [35]. Vaccine products must meet
these mandatory criteria to achieve WHO prequalification: include an anti-microbial preservative (for
injectable liquid vaccines in multi-dose containers), be relatively thermostable (not requiring storage at
less than -20°C), have a dose volume ≤1 ml (for injectable vaccines), and not require intravenous
administration [35]. Exceptions to the programmatic suitability criteria are made for the prequalification
of certain emergency-use vaccines, such as for the prevention of Ebola Virus Disease, which are stored at
-80°C to -60°C [29]. The first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates to enter human trials in the United States
used a mRNA platform [1, 2]. Most mRNA vaccines for early phase studies are frozen at -70°C [36],
although more stable product are anticipated to be used for the later phase trials. The final storage
temperature for any future licensed mRNA vaccines is unknown. DNA vaccine candidates are more

thermostable, but would likely require administration via electroporation devices. Any licensed products
requiring freezing for storage or nonstandard devices for vaccine administration would be prohibitive to
use at scale in developing countries.
Our study should be interpreted in light of its strengths and limitations. Our use of real-world data inputs
and WHO tools and guidance strengthen the generalizability of the results and comparability to other cold
chain capacity assessments. Since there is no currently licensed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we used the
characteristics of influenza vaccines as proxies. If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine requiring only one dose for
protection is eventually licensed, the estimated doses and storage volumes required could substantially
decrease. Conversely, if only products requiring ultra-low temperature cold chain or extra effort and
training to administer are licensed, the operational feasibility of mass vaccination campaigns for
developing countries would be very limited. We applied WHO recommended routine vaccination
schedules and product characteristics [17, 37], however, as of 2017, some of the routine vaccines we
assumed for the simulated country had limited adoption in African Region countries (Supplemental Table
1). If we overestimated routine vaccine doses and volumes, then there would be even more available
capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our analysis assumes 90% coverage; however, the operational needs
will be decreased if there is less than 90% demand for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among risk groups or if
target coverage is lower. It is critical that pandemic vaccine response have health communications and
social mobilization plans in place, and that efforts to understand and overcome vaccine hesitancy be
made. While we used WHO-recommended chronic diseases prevalence estimates as risk factors for
SARS-CoV-2 [14], some of these diseases may go underdiagnosed in the African Region, resulting in
overestimates of vaccine demand for this risk group. We received vaccine cold storage capacity for Gavieligible countries. As Gavi has led the effort to strengthen cold storage capacities among countries
receiving Gavi support, we do not know whether non-Gavi-eligible countries have comparable capacities
to the Gavi-eligible countries which have received this support.

The development of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines must take into account operational realities and
programmatic suitability in developing countries. While we believe that African Region countries
currently have sufficient overall cold chain capacity to accommodate SARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination
campaigns, our study highlights the limitations in cold storage capacity at national levels and in
workforce availability to administer these vaccines. Vaccination of risk groups with SARS-CoV-2
vaccines is possible with sufficient planning and infrastructure strengthening, but we anticipate risks to
routine immunization and significant logistical challenges. Further, the development of products that are
not programmatically suitable for use in developing country contexts will result in massive inequities, and
concerted global efforts are urgently required to ensure that appropriate preventive interventions are made
available to all who need them globally. Resources must be mobilized urgently to ensure that
infrastructures and training are in place to maximize the impact of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the
African Region and other developing country settings.

Vaccinators

Adults with chronic disease and older adults are at increased risk for severe
SARS-CoV-2 disease [7]. Health care workers are at increased risk for SARSCoV-2 infection and disease [7].
Once pandemic vaccines are available, there will be an imperative to deliver them
expeditiously.
Vaccine wastage is the doses that are lost or unused. Routine immunization inputs
are from WHO guidance while SARS-CoV-2 inputs are from WHO Vaccine
Wastage Rates Calculator assuming African Region, four weeks of retention of
vaccine after vial opened, 2 dose schedule, 90% coverage, daily immunization
sessions, and influenza vaccine [23].
Vaccine reserve stock are the excess supply in case of increased demand or stockouts. Routine inputs are from WHO guidance while SARS-CoV-2 inputs assume
high global demand and limited supply [11, 20, 24].

Every month

Three month supply interval is common for routine immunization in low resource
settings [22], while the SARS-CoV-2 supply interval assumes high global
demand and limited supply.

Same as for routine

Typically, persons delivering vaccines in the region are nurses, but not all nurses
engage in the provision of immunization services. The estimates for nurses per
capita are from WHO [16]. Estimates of percentage of nurses providing
immunization services are from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development [25]. Absenteeism estimates from observational data (baseline) and
modelling data (SARS-CoV-2) from the United States [26, 27].

Notes:
1. Total population of simulated country with the age distribution of the African Region per 2017 [12].
2. From estimates of chronic diseases risk factors for severe SARS-CoV-2 illness for Africa [15].
3. HCWs population used per capita estimates from the WHO African Region (12.79 per 10,000 population) multiplied by the simulated country
population and distributed evenly from ages 20 to 64 [16].
4. The sum of populations in the ≥65 years, chronic diseases, and HCW groups does not equal the population of all risk groups combined, as the HCW
population was adjusted to account for persons with chronic diseases.

Notes:
1. Analysis assumes 90% coverage of target groups and a two-dose series for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
2. We assumed that both HPV doses were delivered to girls at 9 years of age.
3. Vaccinators = nurse density per capita (6.9 per 10,000) x country population (20,000,000) x percent of nurses that provide immunization services (46%).
Nurse data are from WHO Global Health Workforce Statistics [16]. We used the median value from African Region countries at the most recent
available date and divided by country population estimates to calculate per capita values [12].
4. Adjustments account for 3% absenteeism (baseline) and an additional 8% absenteeism (during pandemic) [26, 27].

Notes:
1. We developed a vaccine flow-down schematic (Supplemental Figure 1) to depict the routine vaccine doses maintained at each immunization system
level by month and used it to calculate the total monthly vaccine doses and volumes stored throughout the immunization system. This table uses the
maximum monthly national level (month 10) and subnational level (month 11) vaccine storage volumes from the schematic.
2. The vaccine storage capacity for Gavi-eligible African Region countries was standardized by dividing by the <2 years country population in 2017. The
quartiles and upper range values were calculated and then applied to the simulated African country. We used the median percentage of national level
stores to total stores (32.6%) and health facility stores to total stores (34.9%) from the same data set for the analyses.
3. Immunization system assumptions are in Table 2.

Figure 1. Monthly doses delivered for routine and SARS-CoV-2 risk group vaccination

Notes:
1. Figure includes sufficient doses for 90% coverage of target groups.
2. Figure assumes constant routine immunization demand over the year and constant SARS-CoV-2
immunization demand over a four-month mass vaccination campaign.
3. For illustrative purposes only, the mass vaccination campaign is conducted during months 9 through 12.
4. HCWs target group removed because volume contribution was too small to depict in the Figure.

Figure 2. Monthly routine and SARS-CoV-2 campaign vaccine doses per vaccinator, by WHO
Region estimated nurse density

Notes:
1. Data points represent the total monthly vaccines delivered divided by the total number of vaccinators in a
country. Vaccinators = nurse density per capita x country population (20,000,000) x percent of nurses that
provide immunization services (46%).
2. Nurse data are from WHO Global Health Workforce Statistics [16]. We used the median value from
countries at the most recent available date and divided by country population estimates [12] to calculate per
capita values and then categorized by WHO Region.
3. Routine immunization programs account for 3% absenteeism (baseline). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
programs account for 3% absenteeism (baseline) and an additional 8% absenteeism (during pandemic).
4. HCWs target group removed because volume contribution was too small to depict in the figure.
