Abstract
There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China.
Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+
cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February
2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions
from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.22%) for COVID19 cases outside of China.

The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to be fairly transmissible [1], and is spreading in
China. Disease severity is a particularly important parameter for understanding this new
disease [1], but unfortunately, the case fatality risk (CFR) data from China is difficult to
interpret owing to likely missed mild cases (including due to a lack of appropriate test kits
early in the epidemic) and also the likely delay in deaths occurring. Such a prolonged time
course is suggested by a case series of 138 cases from Wuhan, China with cases enrolled
between 1-28 January 2020. For this group on 3 February, 62% were still hospitalised and
31% (11/36) of those admitted to ICU were still there (6 had died) [2].
In jurisdictions outside China (and excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) the CFR as
detailed in the 13 February WHO Report [3] was 1/447 = 0.22% (95% confidence interval
(CI) = 0.40% to 1.26%). But this estimate also did not account for possible missed mild cases
in those countries or the lag time between hospitalisation and death.
One possible way to get a better estimate of the CFR is to consider the proportion of cases
currently in intensive care units (ICUs) in settings outside China where the healthcare system
is working relatively normally (ie, is not over-burdened by the epidemic). As per Table 1 we
estimated that 4.0% (14/349) of identified cases were in ICUs in all the countries outside of
China that had 20+ cases.

When there were 23 known cases: “all 22 patients
currently isolated are in stable condition.”…”one patient
was discharged from a hospital yesterday after he was
cured”. Based on a news report on 6 February [7].
Based on a news report on 13 February [8]: “Kato said
five people from the ship are currently in serious
condition in hospital”. A prior report on 12 February in
the same news source gave more detail for the first four
people where the Health Minister (Katsunobu Kato) was
reported saying: "At this point, we have confirmed that
four people, among those who are hospitalised, are in a
serious condition, either on a ventilator or in an intensive
care unit." [9]

4.0%
(14/349)

Next we considered the typical survival of people admitted to ICUs with severe respiratory
conditions. We used data from a meta-analysis of trials comparing higher vs lower levels of
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in adults with acute lung injury or acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) [10]. This study found 374 hospital deaths in 1136 patients
(32.9%) assigned to treatment with higher PEEP and 409 hospital deaths in 1163 patients
(35.2%) assigned to lower PEEP (with no significant difference between these two groups).
Combining these data suggests a CFR in such patients with acute lung injury of 34.1%
(783/2299). This estimate is a little less than one case series of ICU patients with acute
respiratory failure from Influenza A (H1N1) and requiring mechanical ventilation, who had a
CFR of 46% (156/337) [11]. Another study of such ICU patients with influenza found a
lower overall CFR of 26% (492/1859) [12] and another one reported a CFR of 24%
(177/733) [13]. Furthermore, in a group of 340 ICU patients with ARDS, the CFR at 90 days
was 32% in a group given a neuromuscular blocker and 41% in the placebo group [14].
We then applied the 34.1% value from the meta-analysis to the data in Table 1, giving an
estimated CFR of 1.37% ([14 x 34.1%]/349) for COVID-19. The 95% confidence interval
(CI) of this estimate is 0.57% to 3.22%. This estimate can be considered a symptomatic CFR
(sCFR) as it likely to be based on a denominator who had symptoms and were tested and
laboratory-confirmed as cases. This estimate is almost invariably higher than the infectionfatality risk (IFR) which can only be estimated when serological testing becomes available to
identify all of those infected [15].
Decision-makers and disease modellers might still be best to assume that the ‘true’ CFR is
less than our estimate here as mild cases may not be identified. Furthermore, if a specific
treatment is identified in the near future, then cases could have improved survival and the
CFR might decline. On the other hand, if health systems became overloaded with the
COVID-19 epidemic, then the CFR could likely increase for both the community and in
hospital cases. As there is further progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, ongoing work will
be needed to better clarify both transmissibility and the CFR, so that the likely mortality

burden can be estimated. The method we have used here for CFR estimation will only be
valid prior to healthcare systems becoming overloaded, after which they are likely to change
their ICU admission policies.
Our provisional CFR estimate for COVID-19 is less than that estimated for MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV, but is broadly comparable with two of the three previous influenza pandemics
(when considering the range of estimated values) (Table 2).

Based on 8,096 reported cases, including 774 deaths in

an over-estimate given the possibility of mild cases not
being detected.
Highest in those aged <1 year (at 5.2%) and in the very
old (70 to 74 years, 5.3%) [18]. Lowest in young children
(5 to 9 years, 0.5%) and middle-aged adults (55 to 59
years, 0.9%). There was an intermediate peak in the CFR
among young adults (25 to 29 years, 3.1%).
These values could, however, be over-estimates given the
possibility of mild cases not being detected (see main
text).
A systematic review considered 77 estimates from 50
published studies [19]. The values for symptomatic cases
had point estimates ranging from 0 to 1,200 per 100,000
cases. Nevertheless, “most of the estimates in this
category [symptomatic cases] fell in the range of 5 to 50
deaths per 100,000 cases.”
