Abstract

Objective. To compare the patient population, common complaints, and physician
recommendations in direct-to-consumer chat-based consults, before and during the COVID-19
outbreak.
Data sources. Data on patient characteristics, patient complaints, and physician recommendations
from 36,864 chat-based telemedicine consults with physicians in an online-clinic by patients from
across the United States between April 2019 and April 2020.
Study Design. We perform a retrospective analysis comparing patient characteristics, visit
characteristics, and physician recommendation before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. We
examine patient age and gender, visit time, patient chief complains, and physician medical
recommendation (including prescription drugs, reassurance, and referrals).
Principal Findings. Before March 2020, most patients were female (75 percent) and 18–44 years
old (89 percent). Common complaints such as abdominal pain, dysuria, or sore throat suggested
minor acute conditions. Most cases (67 percent) were resolved remotely, mainly via prescriptions;
a minority were referred. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 emergency has led to a sharp
(fourfold) increase in case volume, including more males (from 25 to 29 percent), patients aged
45 and older (from 11 to 17 percent), and more cases involving mental health complaints and
complaints related to COVID-19. Across all symptoms, significantly more cases (78 percent)
have been resolved remotely.
Conclusions. The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has been associated with a sharp
increase in the use of chat-based telemedicine services, including by new patient demographics,
an increase in both COVID-19 and mental health complains, and an increase in remote case
resolutions.

Introduction
In response to the need to maintain social distance, the Coronavirus Diseases 2019
(COVID-19) crisis has catalyzed a rapid expansion in telemedicine services, which
provide the opportunity to maintain access to and continuity of medical care while
reducing the potential for contagion. In March, the United States federal government, the
United Kingdom government, and many other healthcare systems throughout the world
substantially expanded the provision and coverage of care via telemedicine, leading to a
surge in both supply and demand for it.1,2 The growth of telemedicine enabled and
accelerated the use of different models of remote care, raising the question of what will
become of these new approaches to treatment once the immediate COVID-19 crisis has
passed.3
A care model that was popular even before the current crisis involves chat-based directto-consumer interactions based on mobile technology.3,4 Mobile apps and patient portals
allow instantaneous remote written consults with providers, synchronously and
asynchronously.5,6 Consults are typically initiated by patients and include symptom
intake followed by an interaction with a provider, usually for acute conditions. The
benefits of chat-based consults include convenience and ease of access relative not only
to office-based care by eliminating travel but also to remote care via video and voice
conversations, as these written consults can be used privately even in crowded spaces,
such as during a commute. Services include both asynchronous and synchronous
encounters with providers that are sometimes augmented by algorithms that facilitate
symptom intake or diagnostics. Patient-initiated remote care can be seen as the digital
evolution of on-demand walk-in care that has been expanding in recent years in various
settings such as retail clinics and urgent care centers, that resolve minor acute conditions
and triage for more urgent or complex cases.
This study analyzes the use of direct-to-consumer, chat-based care in one online clinic
that has been serving patients in more than 40 US states since April 2019. We study both
usage before the COVID-19 crisis and changes brought about by the crisis through the
emergency lockdowns that restricted access to traditional care settings. Understanding
past and current use of chat-based remote care can inform policy discussions about
potential roles for this care technology during current continuing efforts to mitigate
COVID-19 and in the future once this crisis has passed.

Setting and Data
We study an online clinic affiliated with K Health, a technology startup, that has been
offering chat-based synchronous consults since April 2019.7 Consults can be initiated by

patients from anywhere in the United States through a mobile app available through app
stores. Upon log in, patients report their age, gender, and current symptoms through an
automated and adaptive structured questionnaire generated by a machine learning
algorithm. After completing a conversation with the app, users are provided with
information regarding the potential conditions they may have, which is automatically
generated by an algorithm. At that point, patients can request to chat with a doctor, for an
out-of-pocket payment (during the study period, the fee was up to $20 per visit). Requests
are routed to the first available physician in a US-based online clinic operated by
K Health.
The assigned physician reviews a summary of the patient intake and further interacts with
the patient via free text-based chat. Physicians can provide reassurance and self-care
instructions, recommend over-the-counter drugs, prescribe drugs electronically, and order
diagnostic labs. Physicians may also refer patients to an office-based primary care
physician or specialist or, if they deem it appropriate, to an urgent care center or an
emergency department.

Study Design and Methods
Study Sample and Key Variables

We perform a retrospective analysis of electronic health records of chat-based
telemedicine consults that were completed through the K Health mobile app from April
2019 through April 2020. Our sample consists of 36,864 completed chat consults by
patients aged 18–65. We exclude a small number of cases that were discontinued before a
recommendation had been made due to technical problems. Data on each visit include the
patient age, gender, the chief complaint reported by the patient during the intake, the time
the patient initiated the chat (in the patient’s local time), and the physician
recommendation at the end of the chat. Based on the physician recommendation, we
consider cases as “resolved,” if they were concluded with a physician reassurance,
prescription, or a lab order. We consider cases as “referred” if the physician referred the
patient to a primary care physician, other physician specialists, urgent care, or an
emergency department.
Study Period

Our study period is from April 2019 through April 2020. Therefore, our sample includes
consults that occurred both before and during the COVID-19 crisis, and thus allow us to
compare patient and consult characteristics between these periods. While the first
COVID-19 case was identified in the United States in late January 2020, it was not until
March that most activities, including primary care, were affected in most states. As seen
in Exhibit 1, the surge in the weekly number of consults started only after a national

emergency was declared on March 13, 2020 (from an average of 502 consults per week,
to an average of more than 2000 from April 1). Therefore, we split our sample into two
subsamples: before and after March 1, 2020 (24,275 consults before and 12,589 consults
after). We obtain similar results (for sensitivity analysis, thus not shown) using February
1, 2020 or March 15 as the cutoff.
Methods

We compare the distribution of different patient and visit characteristics by calculating
their relative share of all consults in each period. While we do not exclude any chief
complaint from our main sample, due to space constraints, exhibits only show data for the
15 most common complaints (before and after March 2020). These complaints account
for 57.0 percent of all consults until February 2020 and 66.3 percent of cases after March
2020. We calculate standard errors analytically, except for the odds ratio, for which we
estimate standard errors using the bootstrap method, stratified by period. Details of the
bootstrap method are discussed in the on-line supplementary material.
Limitations

Our study had a number of limitations. First, our sample is not representative of the US
population and therefore results should not be interpreted as such. Second, we are unable
to follow patients outside of their interactions with the app and therefore cannot study
patient compliance with the recommendations or the resulting patient outcomes. In
particular, we cannot speak to the interaction of chat-based consults and care occurring in
other settings and therefore cannot assess how cases were managed after the consult or
how consults affected the demand for other modes of care.8,9

Results
Patient and Visit Characteristics

Exhibit 2 shows patient and visit characteristics before and after March 2020. During the
baseline period of April 2019 through February 2020, most patients were female (75.1
percent) and between 18–44 years old (88.9 percent of all patients, 90.1 of female and
85.2 of male). Most consults were requested on a weekday (73.5 percent) and during the
daytime, defined as 7 a.m.–7 p.m. patient local time (70.8 percent). Since March 2020,
there has been a significant increase in the proportion of male patients among users (from
24.9 before to 29.3 percent after), and in patients 45 and older of both genders (from 11.1
percent to 16.9 percent overall; from 14.8 percent to 19.5 percent male; from 9.9 percent
to 15.7 percent female). Supplementary Exhibit 1 shows kernel density estimates of the
distribution of patient age, by patient gender, before and after March 2020. Since March
2020, there have been slightly more weekday consults (75.4 percent) and daytime
consults (73.1 percent).

Reported Symptoms

Until February 2020, the most common complaints were vaginal discharge, abdominal
pain, dysuria, sore throat, cough, headache, anxiety, back pain, depressed mood, fever,
chest pain, nasal congestion, dental pain, tender sinuses, nausea, rash, ear pain, and
dyspnea. These complaints are largely associated with minor acute conditions, but
notably include mental health complaints. Together, these complaints accounted for 57
percent of consults. Panel A of Exhibit 3 shows the individual frequencies of these most
common complaints.
The COVID-19 emergency and the period following it were associated with a spike in
self-reported symptoms related to COVID-19. Panel B of Exhibit 3 shows the change in
symptom frequency from before to after March 2020, sorted by the size of the change.
Notable increases were in complaints associated with COVID-19 symptoms: dyspnea
,also known as shortness of breath, (OR 4.64, 95 percent CI: 4.11, 5.28) increased from
the eighteenth most common complaint to the third most common complaint, and cough
(OR 1.98; 95 percent CI: 1.83, 2.16) increased from being the fifth most common
complaint to the most common complaint overall. Anxiety (OR 2.00; 95 percent CI: 1.83,
2.20) and depressed mood (OR 1.35; 95 percent CI: 1.20, 1.51) also increased, to become
the second and seventh most common complaints. Another set of complaints that saw an
increase include those that would typically be addressed elsewhere, such as dental pain
(OR 1.41; 95 percent CI: 1.22, 1.62). Some complaints, such as back pain, that were
common until February 2020 saw marked decreases from March 2020 (OR 0.55; 95
percent CI: 0.47, 0.64), perhaps due to decreased physical strain due to lockdowns and
unemployment.
Case Resolutions

Most chat-based consults are resolved during the consult by the physician without the
patient being further referred by the physician to other providers. Exhibit 4 shows the
distribution of physician recommendations. Panel A shows the overall shares of cases
that were resolved and referred, before and after March 2020. Before March 2020, a
share of 67 percent of cases were resolved. Panels B and C further show the shares of
more specific recommendations, separately for resolved and referred cases. The most
common resolutions were prescriptions for drugs (34.5 percent of all consults), over-thecounter drugs (18.4 percent), and reassurance (12.9 percent). Lab tests were rarely
ordered (1.2 percent). The most common referrals were to primary care physicians (11.9
percent of all consults) and physician specialists (10.8 percent). A small share of cases
was referred to emergency departments (6.6 percent) and urgent care (3.7 percent).
Since March 2020, the share of resolved cases increased from 67 to 77.6 percent of
consults, with a clear shift toward more prescription drugs (51.2 percent of all consults)

and fewer referrals to office-based physicians (6.9 percent to primary care physicians and
7.7 percent to other physicians’ specialists). There was a smaller decrease in the share of
consults referred to the emergency room (5.3 percent) and urgent care (2.5 percent).These
differences are all statistically significant (p<0.01), based on a two-sided chi-squared test
(See supplementary material for more details).
Exhibit 5 shows the distribution of physician recommendations by chief complaint, for
the most common complaints, before and after March 2020. After March 2020, there
were more case resolutions through prescriptions and fewer referrals across many
different complaints, consistent with the circumstances that made referrals to face-to-face
encounters less appealing in the presence of stay-at-home orders. Exhibit 5 also reveals
the heterogeneity in the resolution and referral rates of different complaints. Complaints
associated with minor infections, such as tender sinuses, were more likely than other
complaints to be treated remotely via prescriptions both until February 2020 (68.6
percent of patients reporting tender sinuses were prescribed medications, compared with
34.5 of all) and after March 2020 (76 percent of patients reporting tender sinuses were
prescribed medications, compared with 51.2 percent of all cases). In contrast, cases with
mental health complaints were more likely than other cases to be referred both until
February 2020 (62.5 percent of anxiety complaints, compared with 22.7 percent of all
cases) and from March 2020 (43.5 percent of anxiety complaints, compared with 14.6
percent of all cases).

Policy Implications
Telemedicine, which had been expanding prior to the current crisis, is assuming a central
role in the response of many healthcare systems to the COVID-19 crisis. Different modes
of telemedicine are being rapidly deployed, and existing ones, like the chat-based remote
care we have studied, have seen a rapid surge in use. There have been important policy
changes to support this shift, such as lifting of requirement for state licensure during the
pandemic.
Our analysis highlights several key opportunities for using patient-initiated remote
synchronous chat-based consults with physicians. In normal times, chat-based consults
offer high rates of resolution and can expedite care for many minor conditions, while
further referring complex cases. Beyond the convenience and savings in travel they offer,
chat-based consults may provide a point of contact with healthcare providers for people
without medical insurance and thus have the potential to mitigate access issues related to
insurance coverage.

In an emergency, chat-based consults can quickly adapt to a surge in utilization and
provide patients in any location access to primary medical care, even including areas
under lockdown conditions that make visiting providers in person more difficult. The
increase in complaints related to COVID-19 and the shift toward more resolution and
fewer non-urgent referrals of most cases suggest that chat-based remote care has
contributed to remote triage in the COVID-19 emergency, internalizing the increased
associated risks. The fact that telemedicine clinics can serve patients in all states has
significant implications not only for their use during lockdowns but also for handling the
surge of deferred non-urgent conditions that will follow once the restrictions are eased.
The increase in mental health complaints also suggests that chat-based platforms can
also help provide improved access and initial assessment to such cases and may help
avert a mental health crisis that might result from extended lockdowns and increased
individual economic uncertainty.10,11

Conclusion
Telemedicine serves several purposes in the current emergency, including remote triage
and continued care for chronic patients who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19
complications.12 It is likely that care models involving remote care will continue to
develop during the current crisis and will assume a greater role than they did previously
after the crisis ends.2,3,13 These developments raise many questions about the
characteristics of different models of telemedicine and their potential role in healthcare
provision.
This study provides novel data on the use of chat-based consults with physicians before
and during the current public health emergency. Results suggest this type of service is
already providing treatment for minor acute cases. While we cannot directly assess
provider decision making, the ways physicians have changed their recommendations in
response to the constraints of lockdowns (e.g., by prescribing more and referring less to
primary care, while still routing some cases to the emergency department) and the
variation across conditions in the type of resolution (no referrals of nasal congestion
complaints but many referrals of anxiety complaints) provide hopeful signs regarding
care quality in the remote setting.
One concern is that the ease of access of direct-to-consumer chat consults could increase
utilization by patients with very minor conditions that would otherwise resolve on their
own and may even increase low-value use of other services if such cases are
unnecessarily referred to other providers. The high rates of remote resolutions and the
low rates of referrals (even prior to the COVID-19 crisis) are hopeful signs that this
might not be the case in our sample and that providers acknowledge that the distribution

of cases arriving through this mode may be different than those arriving at the physician’s
office, although further research on this issue is needed.
Given the large expansion of the use of telemedicine, including use by demographic
groups of patients (and in other settings, of providers) who were less likely to use such
services before the crisis, the current crisis will likely accelerate the adoption of these
new modes after the current crisis ends.13 Our results highlight the possibility of
introducing direct-to-consumer chat-based remote care into the set of care options. Such
option improves access and economizes on travel for patients living in remote areas or
that are immobile and appears ready to handle minor acute conditions that require little
coordination. A bigger challenge, and perhaps a bigger opportunity, is the use of directto-consumer remote care to manage chronic and more complex patients. Such patients
use care more often and therefore would benefit more from the reduction of travel and the
protection from risks (such as COVID-19 and other infections) associated with face-toface care. However, managing complex cases involves greater coordination challenges
and would require tighter integration with other care modes. Direct-to-consumer remote
care may also alter the boundaries of local markets for primary care services, by allowing
providers to interact with geographically dispersed patients. As this and other new modes
of telemedicine are likely going to play an increasing role in the provision of healthcare,
its continuing assessment will be an important input for policy and practice alike.

through February 2020, sorted by their share of total consults in descending order. Panel B shows the change in each
complaint’s share of total consults after March 2020, relative to the baseline period, sorted by the rate of change in
descending order. Points and bars are point estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for the odds ratios. The
dashed line shows an odds-ratio of 1 (no change). The numbers in parentheses show the rank of each condition before
and after March 2020. In both panels, data are shown for all patient-reported chief complaints that were among the 15
most common either before or after March 2020. The data are available in Supplementary Exhibit 3.

Notes: For the study sample of completed chat-based remote consults in the K Health-affiliated clinic in the periods of
April 2019 through February 2020 and March 2020 through April 2020, Panel A shows the shares of consults for which
the physician resolved the case remotely and the share of consults that were further referred to other providers. Panels
B and C show further details on the specific type of resolution or referral. In all panels, shares are out of all sampled
consults. The data are available in Supplementary Exhibit 4.

Details of Statistical Methods
This section describes in the statistical methods we use for estimation and inference.
Standard errors of proportions that are presented in our main exhibits were calculated

using the formula: 1  /, where  is the sample size and  is the proportion of
cases. For comparing proportions (e.g., patient gender) between our two main samples of
cases that occurred before and after March 2020, we use a chi-square test for the
difference between proportions without continuity correction, with periods (before and
after March 2020) as rows, and outcomes (e.g., different age groups or times of consults)
as columns. For estimating the standard errors of the odds-ratio of the change in symptom
frequencies before versus after March 2020, we use the bootstrap method.14 We draw
with replacement 1,000 bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data, stratified
by period (namely, sampling is done from each of the sampled periods—before and after
March 2020—separately). We then calculate, for each drawn sample, the odds ratio. We
then report as the confidence interval the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the odds ratio
statistic. We implement this method using the ``boot’’ package in R.

Notes: The table shows the share, out of all consults, of each of the most common chief complaints in the periods of
April 2019 through February 2020 and March through April 2020. Complaints are sorted by their share of total consults
in the baseline period in descending order. Rank is the frequency rank (with 1 being the most frequent). Odds ratios
reflect the change in the share of each complaint before and after March 2020. Data are shown for all patient-reported
chief complaints that were among the 15 most common either before or after March 2020.
