SUMMARY

26

Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public

27

health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease

28

outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including

29

complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions

30

associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical

31

outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with

32

suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for

33

complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis,

34

and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients – effects

35

that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of

36

nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in

37

addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results

38

in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted

39

a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our

40

scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL

41

variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing

42

evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative

43

transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal

44

analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with

45

clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity,

46

susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.

INTRODUCTION

48

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had profound economic, social, and public health impact with over 6.1

49

million confirmed cases and over 370,000 deaths across the globe. The infection causes respiratory illness

50

with symptoms ranging from cough and fever to difficulty breathing. While highly variable age-

51

dependent mortality rates have been widely reported, the comorbidities that drive this dependence are not

52

fully understood. Further, with some notable exceptions1-3, molecular studies have largely focused on

53

ACE-2, the receptor and determinant of cell entry and viral replication3. While ACE-2 expression is

54

critical, viruses employ a wide range of molecular strategies to infect cells, avoid detection, and

55

proliferate. In addition, viral replication and immune mediated pathology are the primary drivers of

56

morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection4,5. Therefore, understanding how virus-

57

host interactions manifest as SARS-CoV-2 risk factors will facilitate clinical management, choice of

58

therapeutic interventions, and setting of appropriate social and public health measures.

59
60

Knowledge of the precise molecular interactions that control viral replicative cycles can delineate

61

regulatory programs that mediate immune pathology associated with infection and provide valuable clues

62

about disease determinants. For example, viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, deploy an array of genetically

63

encoded strategies to co-opt host machinery. Among the strategies, viruses encode multifunctional

64

proteins that harness or disrupt cellular functions, including nucleic acid metabolism and modulation of

65

immune responses, through protein-protein interactions and molecular mimicry – structural similarity

66

between viral and host proteins (for a full discussion please see accompanying paper). Recently, we

67

employed protein structure modeling to systematically chart interactions across all human infecting

68

viruses6 and in an accompanying paper, performed a virome-wide scan for molecular mimics. This

69

analysis points to broad diversification of strategies deployed by human infecting viruses and identifies

70

biological processes that underlie human disease. Of particular interest, we mapped over 140 cellular

71

proteins that are mimicked by coronaviruses (CoV). Among these, we identified components of the

72

complement and coagulation pathways as targets of structural mimicry across all CoV strains (see

73

companion paper).

74
75

Through activation of one of three cascades, (i) the classical pathway triggered by an antibody–antigen

76

complex, (ii) the alternative pathway triggered by binding to a host cell or pathogen surface, and (iii) the

77

lectin pathway triggered by polysaccharides on microbial surfaces, the complement system is a critical

78

regulator of host defense against pathogens including viruses7. When dysregulated by germline variants or

79

acquired through age-related effects or excessive acute and chronic tissue damage, complement activation

80

can contribute to pathologies mediated by inflammation7-9. Similarly, inflammation-induced coagulatory

81

programs -- which themselves can be regulated by the complement system -- as well as crosstalk between

82

pro-inflammatory cytokines and the coagulative and anticoagulant pathways play pivotal roles in

83

controlling pathogenesis associated with infections. Therefore, while the age-related differences in

84

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 are likely a consequence of multiple underlying variables, virally encoded

85

structural mimics of complement and coagulation pathway components may contribute to CoV associated

86

immune mediated pathology. Moreover, a corollary of these observations is that dysfunctions associated

87

with complement and/or coagulation may impact clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For

88

example, the companion study suggests that coagulation disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, thrombosis

89

and hemorrhage, may represent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcome. Among complement-

90

associated disorders, multiple genetic and experimental evidence (including animal models of disease,

91

histological examination of affected tissue, and germline mutational analysis) point to dysregulation of

92

the complement system as the major driver of both early-onset, and age-related macular degeneration

93

(AMD)8-11. A hyperinflammatory phenotype mediated by complement leads to progressive immune-

94

mediated deterioration of the central retina. While AMD, the leading cause of blindness in elderly

95

individuals (affecting roughly 200 million people worldwide11), is likely the result of multiple

96

pathological processes, dysregulation of complement activation has emerged as the most widely accepted

97

cause of disease9-12.

98
99

To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems

100

impact adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a retrospective

101

observational study of 11,116 patients at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical

102

Center. In agreement with previous reports13, survival analysis identified significant risk of mechanical

103

respiration and mortality associated with age and sex, as well as history of hypertension, obesity, type 2

104

diabetes (T2D), and coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, we found that patients with history of

105

macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and coagulation disorders (i.e.

106

thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) were at significantly increased risk of adverse clinical

107

outcomes (including mechanical respiration and death) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly,

108

these effects could not be explained by either age or sex, nor did we find any evidence that history of

109

smoking contributes to risk of adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

110

Conversely, albeit in a small number of individuals, we observed that no patients with complement

111

deficiency disorders required mechanical respiration or succumbed to their illness. In addition,

112

transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected

113

patients demonstrates that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory

114

immune responses, infection results in robust engagement and activation of the complement and

115

coagulation pathways.

116
117

Finally, a focused analysis of proximal and distal variants of complement and coagulation components

118

using the April 2020 COVID data released by the UK Biobank revealed genetic markers associated with

119

severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among our findings, we identified variants in CD55 (a negative regulator

120

of complement activation14), CFH and C4BPA, which play central roles in complement activation and

121

innate immunity. Importantly, analysis of the May 2020 COVID data released by the UK Biobank

122

recapitulated these results and identified additional variants. For example, the scan revealed that variants

123

in Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), a protease inhibitor and cytokine transporter which participates in the

124

formation of fibrin clots and regulates inflammatory cascades, were associated with adverse clinical

125

outcome. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection,

126

the data point to several putative genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using

127

a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-

128

function analysis with clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and

129

predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.

RESULTS

132

Comorbidity statistics and covariances in a retrospective observational clinical cohort

133

To explore if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact

134

adverse clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2, we conducted a retrospective observational

135

study of patients treated at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center for

136

suspected infection (Table 1). Electronic health records (EHR) were used to define sex, age, and smoking

137

history status as well as histories of macular degeneration, coagulatory disorders (i.e. thrombocytopenia,

138

thrombosis, and hemorrhage), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and obesity (see

139

Methods). As shown in Table 1, of the 11,116 patients that presented to the hospital between February 1,

140

2020 and April 25, 2020 with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6,398 tested positive for the virus.

141

Among these, 88 were patients with a history of macular degeneration, four were patients with

142

complement deficiency disorders, and 1,179 were patients with disorders associated with the coagulatory

143

system. In addition, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, and annotated cough were

144

represented by 1,922, 1,566, 847, 791, and 727 patients, respectively (Table 1). While CAD,

145

hypertension, T2D, obesity, and coagulation disorders represent a group with the highest covariance, we

146

find lower co-occurrence between these conditions and macular degeneration in both SARS-CoV-2

147

positive and negative individuals (Figure S1). In addition to these medical histories, smoking status, past

148

or present, was noted for 5,079 patients (of 1,359 smokers included in the study, 723 were SARS-CoV-2

149

positive). Finally, of patients who were put on mechanical ventilation, we observed a 35% mortality rate,

150

and 31% of deceased patients had been on mechanical respiration.

151
152

Macular degeneration and coagulation disorders are associated with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes

153

We estimated the univariate and age- and sex-corrected risk associated with baseline clinical history of

154

previously reported SARS-CoV-2 risk factors (including hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and

155

coronary artery disease) as well as coagulation and complement disorders using survival analysis and Cox

156

proportional hazards regression modeling. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, we identified significant

157

risk of mechanical respiration and mortality associated with age and sex, as well as history of

158

hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD). Notably, we did not

159

find evidence that smoking status (past or present) is a significant risk factor for either mechanical

160

respiration or mortality. We found that those with a history of macular degeneration (a proxy for

161

complement activation disorders) and coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and

162

hemorrhage) were at significantly increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes (including mechanical

163

respiration and death) following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1, Table 1). Specifically, we observed a

164

mechanical respiration rate of 15.9% (95% CI: 8.3-23.6; HR: 2.2, Pvalue = 0.0046) and a mortality rate of

165

25% (95% CI: 16.0-34.0; HR 3.0, Pvalue = 4.4x10-7) among patients with a history of macular

166

degeneration, and rates of 9.4% (95% CI: 7.7-11.1; HR 1.5, Pvalue = 9.6x10-5) and 14.7% (95% CI: 12.7-

167

16.7; HR: 2.3, Pvalue = 1.8 x10-23) for mechanical respiration and mortality, respectively, among patients

168

with coagulation disorders (Table 1). Moreover, as shown in Figure 1b, patients with a history of macular

169

degeneration appear to succumb to disease more rapidly than others. Critically, the contribution of age

170

and sex was not sufficient to explain the increased risks associated with history of macular degeneration

171

(Age/Sex-Corrected mechanical respiration HR=1.8 95% CI: 1.1-3.2, Pvalue = 0.024; Age/Sex-Corrected

172

mortality HR=1.7 95% CI: 1.1-2.5, Pvalue = 0.022) or coagulation disorders (Age/Sex-Corrected

173

mechanical respiration HR=1.5. 95% CI: 1.2-1.8, Pvalue = 2.4x10-4; Age/Sex-Corrected mortality

174

HR=1.8 95% CI: 1.5-2.1, Pvalue = 3.4x10-12). Conversely, albeit in a small number of individuals, we

175

observed that among patients with complement deficiency disorders, who are normally at increased risk

176

of complications associated with infections, none required mechanical respiration or succumbed to their

177

illness (Table 1, Figure 1a and 1b). Importantly, while the correlation between macular degeneration or

178

coagulopathies and established covariates included in this study is low (as shown in Supplemental Figure

179

S1 and Supplemental Table S1, Tanimoto coefficients between 0.038 and 0.050 and 0.25 and 0.38,

180

respectively), further study, perhaps with larger patient cohorts, will be necessary to rule out

181

comorbidities that may be associated with macular degeneration and coagulopathies. Together, these data

182

suggest that hyper-active complement and coagulative states predispose individuals to adverse outcomes

183

associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that deficiencies in complement components may be

184

protective. Importantly, given the low incidence rate of deficiencies in either complement or coagulation

185

pathways, further analysis with larger clinical cohorts is warranted.

187

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust transcriptional regulation of complement and coagulation

188

components.

189

Transcriptional responses of human NP epithelial cells during viral infection can provide critical

190

information about underlying immune programs. We leveraged whole genome RNA sequencing (RNA-

191

seq) profiles to identify differentially regulated genes and pathways in 650 NP swabs from control and

192

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who presented to Weill-Cornell Medical Center. As shown in Figure 2a,

193

gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of HALLMARK gene sets found that SARS-CoV-2 infection (as

194

defined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and stratified into ‘positive’, ‘low’, ‘medium’ or ‘high’ based

195

on viral load; see Methods) induces genes related to pathways with known immune modulatory functions,

196

including ‘inflammatory_response’, ‘interferon_alpha_response’, and ‘IL6_JAK_STAT3_signaling (FDR

197

corrected Pvalue < 0.001; Figure 2a). Moreover, we found that among the most enriched gene sets,

198

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust activation of the complement cascade (FDR corrected Pvalue <

199

0.001), with increasing enrichment and significance with viral load (FDR corrected Pvalue < 0.0001). We

200

extended the analysis to include all complement and coagulation associated gene sets in MsigDB and

201

identified

202

‘Reactome_initial_triggering_of_complement’ to be enriched in expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2

203

infected samples (Qvalue < 0.05; representative GSEA profiles are shown in Figure 2b and a full list of

204

enriched pathways and gene sets can be found at https://masonlab.shinyapps.io/CovidGenes/). As

205

highlighted in Figure 2c-e, the pathway-level transcriptional regulation induced by SARS-CoV-2

206

identified by GSEA is also observed at the individual gene level for upregulated and downregulated

207

regulated transcripts as well as those that are particularly upregulated in the context of high viral load

208

(Figure 2d, e, f, respectively). Taken together, the data demonstrate that in addition to immune factors like

209

Type I interferons and dysregulation of IL6-dependent inflammatory responses which has been linked to

poor clinical outcome13, transcriptional control of complement and coagulation cascades is a feature of

215

The data highlighted above provide evidence that complement and coagulation disorders play a role in

216

SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome and that infection with this virus induces robust transcriptional

217

regulation of complement and coagulation pathway components. Moreover, dysfunction of complement

218

or coagulation cascades can be the result of either acquired dysregulation, genetically encoded variants, or

219

both. However, any genetic factors that may underlie the clinical trends we observed remain hidden due

220

to the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of available genetic data on these patients. On the

221

other hand, the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study with deep genetic, physical, and health data

222

collected on ~500,000 individuals across the United Kingdom15,16, recently released SARS-CoV-2

223

infection and outcome statuses for 1,474 patients, allowing for genetic and epidemiological associations

224

to be assessed. The release in April 2020 included 669 patients who tested positive for the virus, 572 of

225

whom required hospitalization.

226
227

We conducted a candidate driven study to evaluate if genetic variation in components of complement or

228

coagulation pathways are associated with poor SARS-CoV-2 clinical outcome. Briefly, we focused our

229

analysis on 337,147 (181,032 female) subjects of White British descent, excluding 3rd degree and above

230

relatedness and without aneuploidy15. Applying these restrictions to the April-2020 cohort resulted in 910

231

patients with suspected infection (388 positive, 332 positive and hospitalized; see Methods). As detailed

232

Supplemental Table S2, of the 805,426 genetic variants profiled in the UK Biobank, 2,888 are within a

233

60Kb window around 102 genes with known roles in regulating complement or coagulation cascades

234

(results that follow are robust to varying window size between 40Kb-80Kb; see Methods, Figure 3a-b).

235

We focused our analysis on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with minor allele frequency (MAF)

236

above 1% and, as shown in Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure S2a-f, used an empirical permutation

237

analysis to set the study-wide significance alpha (α) thresholds for each analysis described below (see

238

Methods). As highlighted in Figure 3c and further detailed in Supplemental Table S2, we identified 11

239

loci representing 7 genes with study-wide significance (α = 0.001) in the April-2020 cohort. Among

240

these, and proximal to coagulation factor III (F3), is variant rs72729504 which we find to be associated

241

with increased risk of adverse clinical outcome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 1.93). Fibrin

242

fragment D-dimer, one of several peptides produced when cross-linked fibrin is degraded by plasmin, is

243

the most widely used clinical marker of activated blood coagulation. Among the genetic loci that

244

influence D-dimer levels, GWAS studies have identified mutations in F3 as having the strongest

245

association17. Importantly, increased D-dimer levels were recently reported to correlate with poor clinical

246

outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients13. So, while the functional role of rs72729504 remains to be

247

elucidated, our observations suggest that this locus may represent a genetic marker of SARS-CoV-2

248

susceptibility and outcomes.

249
250

In addition to the SNP highlighted above, we identified 4 variants (rs45574833, rs61821114, rs61821041,

251

and rs12064775) previously reported as risk alleles for AMD in the UKBB dataset18. Moreover, we find

252

that each of these variants predisposes carriers to adverse clinical outcome (i.e. hospitalization) following

253

SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 2.13-2.65). A fifth variant, rs2230199, which maps to complement C3, was

254

shown to be linked to AMD in an independent GWAS, however, this variant has not been associated with

255

increased AMD risk in the UK population. The three SNPs that map to C3 each appear to confer some

256

protection associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 0.66-0.68). In addition, two of the identified

257

variants (rs61821114 and rs61821041) map to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with

258

Complement Decay-Accelerating Factor (CD55)19. This protein negatively regulates complement

259

activation by accelerating the decay of complement proteins, thereby disrupting the cascade and

260

preventing immune-mediated damage7. As reported by GTex Consortium data19 and highlighted in Figure

261

3d, these eQTLs result in decreased expression of CD55, thereby relieving the restraining function of this

262

protein. In agreement with the functional role of CD55, we observe that these variants are associated with

263

increased risk of adverse clinical outcome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 2.34-2.4).

264
265

Genetic association studies performed on relatively small cohorts can be prone to false positives. While

266

permutation analyses to empirically determine statistical significance thresholds were implemented as

267

described in Methods, we also repeated the analysis using updated UKBB data released in May, 2020

268

which included 3,002 patients with suspected infection. Of the 1,073 that tested positive in the updated

269

cohort, 818 required hospitalization (651 and 500 respectively, after ancestry and relatedness filtering, see

270

Methods). Importantly, analysis of the May-2020 COVID data recapitulated 6 of 11 April-2020 findings

271

and identified 16 additional loci with study-wide significance (α = 0.0025, Supplemental Table S2, Figure

272

3c). Among these, the scan revealed 5 variants proximal to Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), a protease

273

inhibitor and cytokine transporter which participates in the formation of fibrin clots and regulates

274

inflammatory cascades20. Of these, 3 (rs10842898, rs669, and rs4883215) are eQTLs associated with

275

significant downregulation of A2M (and concomitant upregulation of A2M-AS1, the antisense RNA of

276

A2M; data available on gtextportal.org) in multiple tissues including mucosa of the esophagus (Pvalue =

277

1.9x10-15) as highlighted in Figure 3e. In addition to A2M, rs10842898 and rs669 are splicing quantitative

278

trait loci (sQTLs) for Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptor (M6PR) a P-type lectin that regulates lysosomal

279

cargo loading and participates in cellular responses to wound healing, cell growth and viral infection21 -

280

suggesting that the SNPs identified may contribute to complex regulation of transcripts with

281

immunological and antiviral roles.

283

As detailed in Supplemental Table S2, 936 of the variants that were part of the study are within haplotype

284

blocks of analyzed genes (see Methods). Analysis focused on SNPs in complement and coagulation

285

haplotype blocks (based on linkage disequilibrium; LD, See Methods) resulted in 16 study-wide

286

significant SNPs (α = 0.01, Figure S3) using the April-2020 cohort, of which 8 repeated at study-wide

287

significance (α = 0.0075, Figure S3) using the May-2020 dataset. These include rs45574833, a variant

288

highlighted above that results in a missense mutation in C4BPA, a protein that controls activation of the

289

classical complement pathway by mediating hydrolysis of complement factor C4b and degradation of the

290

C3 convertase22 (see Supplemental Table S2). In addition, the haplotype-based analysis identified a link

291

between rs731034 (an eQTL in Collectin Subfamily Member 11; COLEC11) and poor clinical outcome

292

in both April-2020 (OR: 1.27) and May-2020 (OR: 1.33) cohorts. COLEC11, a member of the collectin

293

family of C-type lectins, plays an important role in the innate immune system by binding to carbohydrate

294

antigens (with a preference for fucose and mannose) on microorganisms including viruses, facilitating

295

their recognition and removal. This eQTL variant results in significant upregulation of COLEC11 across

296

multiple tissues including lung (Pvalue = 1x10-11) and suggests that sugar moieties on viral proteins may

297

serve as antigenic targets of immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Though experimental

298

validation and functional interrogation of the variants we have identified is required to elucidate their

299

precise pathophysiology, taken together, our observations point to genetic variation in complement and

300

coagulation components as a contributing factor in SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease.

301

303

DISCUSSION

304

Zoonotic infections like the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic pose tremendous risk to public health and

305

socioeconomic factors on a global scale. While the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are

306

exquisitely equipped to deal with noxious agents including viruses, interactions between emerging

307

pathogens and their human hosts can manifest in unpredictable ways. In the case of SARS-CoV-2

308

infection a combination of viral replication and immune mediated pathology are the primary drivers of

309

morbidity and mortality. While recent analysis of coronavirus patients in China, suggests that high serum

310

levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is associated with poor prognosis13 (and as

311

shown in Figure 2, found to be transcriptionally regulated in SARS-CoV-2 patients) further delineation of

312

the regulatory programs that mediate immune pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is

313

necessary. As illustrated in the accompanying paper and by the results presented herein, knowledge of

314

molecular interactions between virus and host can refine hypothesis-driven discovery of disease

315

determinants.

317

Our scan for virus-encoded structural mimics across Earth’s virome pointed to molecular mimicry as a

318

pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicated that the protein structure space used by a given

319

virus is dictated by the host proteome (see accompanying paper). Moreover, observations about how

320

coronaviruses exploit this strategy provided clues about the cellular processes driving pathogenesis.

321

Together with knowledge that CoV infections, including the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003 and the

322

current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak13, result in hyper-coagulative phenotypes23, our protein structure-function

323

analysis led us to hypothesize that conditions associated with complement or coagulatory dysfunction

324

may influence outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Of these, among the most common are AMD (which

325

is associated with hyper-activation of the complement pathway) and hyper-coagulative disorders. Their

326

relatively high incidence rates together with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in and around New York City made

327

them reasonable candidates for a retrospective clinical study.

328
329

As presented above, in addition to rediscovering previously identified risk factors including age, sex,

330

hypertension, and CAD we found that history of macular degeneration or coagulatory dysfunctions

331

predispose patients to poor clinical outcomes (including increased risk of mechanical ventilation and

332

death) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complement deficiencies on the other hand, appear to be

333

protective. Their low incidence rates, however, make for a small sample size and invite further

334

investigation. Moreover, retrospective studies of observational data have notable limitations in their data

335

completeness, selection biases, and methods of data capture. As a result, claims on causality cannot be

336

made - nor can we definitively rule out other clinical factors as possible drivers. Nevertheless, in an

337

orthogonal analysis of 650 transcriptional profiles of NP swabs, we demonstrate that in addition to

338

immune factors like Type I interferons and dysregulation of IL-6-dependent inflammatory responses,

339

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in engagement and robust activation of complement and coagulation

340

cascades. Dysregulation of complement and coagulation pathways leading to pathology resulting from

341

viral infection is not without precedent. Indeed, it has been associated with Dengue virus infection where

342

immune mediated pathology and dysregulation of complement is correlated with disease severity and

343

mirrors that of acute SARS-CoV-2 disease24. Moreover, though different from the variants identified in

344

this study, polymorphisms and haplotypes in CFH have been associated with severity of Dengue

345

infection25, suggesting that complement and coagulatory disfunctions may represent risk factors for a

346

broader range of pathogens.

347
348

Finally, since complement and coagulative dysfunctions can have both acquired and congenital etiologies,

349

we implemented a focused, candidate-driven analysis of UK Biobank data to evaluate linkage between

350

severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and genetic variation associated with complement and coagulation

351

pathways. Our analysis identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including

352

missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades.

353

Though interpretation of these findings may be limited by sample size, site-specific biases in clinical care

354

decisions, ancestral homogeneity and population stratification in the biobank data, and socioeconomic

355

status of affected populations, to our knowledge, this is the first study to identify complement and

356

coagulation functions as underlying risk-factors of SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome. In addition, given an

357

existing menu of immune-modulatory therapies that target complement and coagulation pathways, the

358

discovery provides a rationale to investigate these options for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 associated

359

pathology. Indeed, the therapeutic potential of complement modulation was recently introduced and

360

further shown to be of significant benefit in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 patients26,27.

361
362

Our study highlights the value of combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function

363

analysis with orthogonal clinical data analysis to reveal determinants and/or predictors of immunity,

364

susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection. Such a framework can help refine large-

365

scale genomics efforts and help power genomics studies based on informed biological and clinical

366

conjectures. While identification of CoV encoded structural mimics guided the retrospective clinical

367

studies, a molecular and functional link between those observations and our discovery of complement and

368

coagulation functions as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains to be elucidated.

369

Nevertheless, the findings advance our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disease and

370

can help explain variability in clinical outcomes. Among the implications, the data warrant heightened

371

public health awareness for individuals most vulnerable to developing adverse SARS-CoV-2 mediated

372

pathology.

Retrospective Clinical Study

484

Cohort and Study Description

485

In this observational cohort study, we used a data warehouse derived from electronic health records

486

(EHRs) from 11,116 patients treated at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical

487

Center for suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For these patients we collected contemporary data

488

from their current encounter (i.e. the encounter associated with their suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection) as

489

well as historical data, if available, from their previous encounters. Contemporary data (data collected

490

between February 1, 2020 and April 12, 2020) included insurance billing information, laboratory

491

measurements, procedures, and SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test results. These data were derived from the

492

data warehouse tables in Epic. 6,927 patients have historical data (data collected prior to September 24,

493

2019) available from an OMOP v5 instance stored using MySQL, which included all of the standard

494

tables for recording condition, procedure, medication, and measurement data (among others). Of these we

495

used the insurance billing information from the condition occurrence table and demographics from the

496

person table. See Preparation of data for modeling for further details on data preparation.

497
498

We used the contemporary data to define inclusion criteria and outcomes (requiring mechanical

499

respiration and mortality) and used historical data to define patient comorbidities. We defined three

500

hypothesized comorbidity covariates, macular degeneration, complement deficiency disorders, and

501

disorders of coagulation. We used historical data to define these comorbidities, age, and sex. We did not

502

include race and ethnicity data in the modeling as we have previously found issues with the data quality28.

503

The race/ethnicity data we do have is included in the tables for reference. We also modeled other

504

comorbidities previously associated with morbidity and mortality (Zhou et al and others), including

505

history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes (Table 1, Table S1) -- all derived

506

from the historical data. Coded covariate definitions, as well as lists of which diagnosis codes are most

507

common in each group, are available in the supplemental materials and methods. We used established

508

institutional procedures and an institutional clinical data warehouse to extract all data from the EHR.

509
510

Defining patient outcomes

511

Outcome definitions were defined by data derived from the electronic health record between February 1,

512

2020 and April 12, 2020. Mortality is derived from a death note filed by a resident or primary provider

513

that records the date and time of death. Intubation was used as an intermediary endpoint and is a proxy for

514

a patient requiring mechanical respiration. We used note types that were developed for patients with

515

SARS-CoV-2 infection to record that this procedure was completed. We validated outcome data derived

516

from notes against the patient’s medical record using manual review.

517
518

Preparation of data for modeling

519

We used MySQL and python libraries (pymysql, pandas) to extract and prepare the data for modeling.

520

The

521

lab/complementcovid) as a Jupyter Notebook titled Data Setup. We begin by creating a master list of

522

suspected covid patients. These are patients that are either diagnosed with the disease, as indicated by a

523

ICD10 code for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in their billing data or a patient that was tested for the presence

524

of the virus using RT-PCR as indicated by a “lab” order for the test. We found 2,821 using the former

525

method and 11,116 patients using the latter. We then extracted birthdates, death dates (if the patient had

526

died or a null value otherwise), and sex codes (1 for female, 2 for male). Patients which had sex codes for

527

non-binary genders were excluded from our analysis. We then define a “first diagnosis date” for each

528

patient as either their first diagnosis date (by billing code) or the first date that they tested positive for

529

SARS-CoV-2, whichever comes first. Next, we calculate each patient’s age at the time of this “first

530

diagnosis date.” Each of the outcomes and covariates are extracted from their respective tables as detailed

531

in the github. Whenever possible, we use the highest-level ancestor code (from the structured vocabulary

532

in OMOP) that represents the concept we want to model. We then use the concept ancestor tables to grab

533

all the descendant codes. Note that diabetic kidney disease was considered for inclusion and so is

534

represented in the data preparation script, however, it was never modeled. Cough is included as a

535

covariate as a reference symptom for comparison. The last step in the preparation process was to compute

536

the censor dates. To do, we iterated through each patient in our master list and computed their time (in

537

days) to intubation (if they required mechanical respiration) or death (if they died). If not, then the study

538

end date (April 25, 2020) was used as the patient’s censored time (in days). Finally, for any patients that

539

were not SARS-CoV-2 positive, their time-to-event values were set to a null indicator to be dropped from

the dataset later. Finally, the data are all combined in a pandas (version 1.0.3) dataframe and saved to disk

541

as a pickle file for efficient loading.

542
543

Statistical Model

544

Our patient timelines may be censored since our study cohort included patients that were being treated at

545

the time of analysis. We performed survival analysis on the intubation orders and death using a Cox

546

proportional-hazards model and visualized the risk using Kaplan-Meier curves using the lifelines python

547

package (version 0.24.4). Error estimates on the Kaplan-Meier curves are estimated using Greenwood’s

548

Exponential Formula29. We fit both univariate models and models fit on the covariate, age, and sex and

549

used log-likelihood to assess significance. We reported Cox proportional hazards coefficients and their

550

95% confidence intervals (Table 1). We modeled whether or not a patient had macular degeneration, a

551

complement deficiency disorder, or a coagulation disorder as binary variables (1=yes, 0=no). Code

552

definitions provided in Table S1. We also included other significant comorbidities suggested by previous

553

studies, CAD, hypertension, T2DM, obesity, or smoking status as binary variables (1=yes, 0=no), sex as a

554

binary variable (0=female, 1=male), age as quantitative variable, older age over 65 (note that age over 65

555

is used only for illustrative purposes and is not used in multivariate modeling -- in the multivariate model

556

age as a quantitative variable is used), and outcome as a binary variable (1=yes, 0=no). The outcome of

557

interest was coded as 0 until the day it occurred (the date of the first intubation order following admission

558

or the death date) or the date of analysis, whichever occurred first. Survival curves are generated for the

559

indicated variables by setting all other variables to their respected averages within the training data. Note

560

that we dropped patients who experienced the outcome before their initial diagnosis. This is either due to

561

patients being hospitalized prior to infection (in the case of intubation) or errors in the coded data. We

562

dropped 121 patients for intubation prior to infection and 12 patients for prior death. We also restricted

563

the study to 90 days from the start date. One patient was removed for having an event outside of this

564

range.

565
566

Covariate Correlations

567

Using the data prepared as discussed above, we computed pairwise statistical correlations between age,

568

sex as well as history of macular degeneration, complement deficiency disorders, coagulation disorders,

569

HTN, T2DM, obesity, and CAD. We computed them using data from all suspected patients (tested both

570

positive and negative) as well as only those patients who tested positive. We used spearman rho and the

571

tanimoto coefficients (1-Jaccard distance) as our measures of correlation. For the comparison using the

572

tanimoto coefficient we binarized age as greater than or equal to 65.

Statistical Software

575

We used Jupyter Notebooks (jupyter-client version 5.3.4 and jupyter-core version 4.6.1) running Python

576

3.7 and all fit models using the python lifelines package (version 0.24.4).

Transcriptomic Analysis of NP swabs

579

Sample Collection and Processing

580

Patient specimens were collected with patients’ consent at New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) and

581

then processed for RT-PCR as described previously30. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were

582

collected using the BD Universal Viral Transport Media system (Becton, Dickinson and Company,

583

Franklin Lakes, NJ) from symptomatic patients.

584
585

Extraction of Viral RNA and RT-PCR detection

586

Total viral RNA was extracted from deactivated samples using automated nucleic acid extraction on the

587

QIAsymphony and the DSP Virus/Pathogen Mini Kit (QIAGEN). One step reverse transcription to

588

cDNA and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of viral targets, E (envelope) and S (spike) genes and

589

internal control, was performed using the Rotor-Gene Q thermocyler (QIAGEN).

590
591

Human Transcriptome Analysis

592

RNA-seq reads that mapped unambiguously to the human reference genome via Kraken2 were used to

593

detect transcriptional responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection as described previously30. Briefly, reads were

594

trimmed with TrimGalore, aligned with STAR (v2.6.1d) to the human reference build GRCh38 and the

595

GENCODE v33 transcriptome reference, gene expression was quantified using featureCounts, stringTie

596

and salmon using the nf-core RNAseq pipeline. Sample QC was reported using fastqc, RSeQC, qualimap,

597

dupradar, Preseq and MultiQC. Reads, as reported by featureCounts, were normalized using variance-

598

stabilizing transform (vst) in DESeq2 package in R and DESeq2 was used to call differential expression

599

with either Positive cases vs Negative, or viral load (High/Medium/Low/None) as reported by RT-PCR

600

cycle threshold (Ct) values. Transcript counts (per million) were used to rank genes and perform gene set

601

enrichment analysis (GSEA).

602
603

Reverse Transcriptase, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR)

604

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples was determined by RT-PCR. Briefly, primers for the E

605

(envelope) gene (which detects all members of the lineage B of beta-CoVs), and the S (spike) gene

606

(which specifically detect SARS-CoV-2). Samples were annotated using RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct)

Genetic Analysis of UK Biobank

612

Data Source

613

UK Biobank subjects that were of White British descent, in the UK Biobank PCA calculations and

614

therefore without 3rd degree and above relatedness and without aneuploidy, were used in this study,

615

totaling 337,147 subjects (181,032 females and 156,115 males) (Bycroft 2018). Of the nearly 500,000

616

participants, approximately 50,000 subjects were genotyped on the UK BiLEVE Array by Affymetrix

617

while the rest were genotyped using the Applied Biosystems UK Biobank Axiom Array, with over

618

800,000 markers using build GRCh37 (hg19). The arrays share 95% marker coverage. We extracted

619

markers with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.005, INFO score greater than 0.3, and Hardy-

620

Weinberg equilibrium test mid-p value greater than 10-10 using PLINK231. UKBB version 3 Imputation

621

combined the Haplotype Research Consortium with the UK10K haplotype resource using the software

622

IMPUTE4 (UK Biobank White paper). Association analyses were performed using a logistic regression

623

model with additive gene dosage and covariates including age at 2018, sex, first 10 principal components

624

(provided by the UK Biobank), and the genotyping array the sample was carried out on. We determined

625

the alpha threshold for study-wide significance using an empirical permutation analysis (see Empirical

626

Permutation Evaluation to set Alpha Thresholds). We performed a study-wide association analysis

627

comparing variants for subjects that were SARS-CoV-2 positive and required hospitalization against the

628

entire population of 337,147 subjects

629
630

Targeted Gene Set Definition

631

The union of coagulation and complement related gene sets (with immunoglobulin genes removed) that

632

are part of MsigDB was used to define the set of 102 genes used in this study. For each gene, we used the

633

transcriptional start and stop site from the hg19 build of the human genome to define a catchment window

634

of 80kbp. From the 805,426 variants profiled in the UK Biobank genotyping data after quality control and

635

QC filters using PLINK2 (see above), 3,540 variants within the transcribed region of the genes of interest

636

or within 80kbp flanking the transcribed region, 2,888 are within 60kbp, 2,292 are within 40kbp, and 936

637

are located in haplotype blocks with study genes.

638
639

Empirical Permutation Evaluation to set Study-wide Alpha Thresholds

640

We used permutation to estimate null distributions of the number of hits expected at 9 alpha thresholds

641

varying from (5x10-5 to 0.05) and by varying the distance threshold from 40kb to 80kb. As shown

642

previously, 80% of GWAS hits are within 60Kb of the nearest gene32. Further, as shown in Supplemental

643

Figure S4, we empirically determined that the majority of eQTLs (>70%) are within 60kb of gene bodies.

644

We performed two sets of permutation analyses: (i) permuted the initial set of genes on which the

645

included variant loci were chosen and (ii) permuted the case/control labels. We repeated each 100 times

646

and used the resulting data to fit a negative binomial distribution as our estimate of the null. Additionally,

647

we evaluated each of the sampled SNP variant sets from (i) and compared their MAF distribution with the

648

MAF distribution of the Complement and Coagulation set. We removed any sets that were significantly

649

different (nominal p-value < 0.05) according to a Mann-Whitney U test (52 of 100 sets were removed due

650

to this criterion; see Supplemental Figure S5). We found that the negative binomial fit the data the best

651

according to a goodness of fit test (Supplemental Figure S2). We used this distribution to assess statistical

652

significance for each combination of alpha and distance values. The result is two estimates of the

653

significance for each alpha (α), distance (d) pair, P(i)α,d and P(ii)α,d, from permutation analyses (i) and (ii)

654

above, respectively. For example:

655
656

X(i)α,d ~ NB(r, p)

657

P(i)α,d = 1-CDFNB(r,p)(kα,d)

658
659

where X(i)α,d is the number of permutation loci with a p-value under the threshold, α. The parameters r and

660

p of the negative binomial represent the number of successes/failures and the probability of success,

661

respectively. Both r and p are fit using non-linear least squares (the curve_fit function in scipy.optimize)

662

on X(i)α,d, the count data from the permutation analyses for the given α and d. The P is then calculated

663

using the CDF of the fitted negative binomial distribution.

664
665

For the gene set permutation analysis (i.e. (i) above) we evaluated each of the 100 replicates to confirm

666

that the minor allele frequency distribution was statistically indistinguishable from that of the complement

667

and coagulation gene set variants. We did so by performing a Mann-Whitney U test between the two

668

distributions and excluded any replicates that showed a significant difference (nominal p-value < 0.05).

669

52 replicates were excluded because of this requirement (Figure SX). This MAF distribution analysis is

670

not necessary for the case/control permutation analysis (i.e. (ii) above) as the loci are the same in each

671

replicate and it is the case/control labels that are permuted.

672
673

Finally, to set the study-wide alpha for each study we chose the greatest threshold value that was gave a P

674

of 0.05 or less for both permutation analysis method:

max α s.t. P(i)α,d < 0.05 and P(ii)α,d < 0.05.

676
677
678

Finally, this entire process was repeated for two cohorts of patients, (a) the initial COVID cohort released

679

by the UK Biobank in April 2020 and (b) the updated COVID cohort released in May 2020. The chosen α

680

for April was 0.001 and the chosen α for May was 0.0025. A data file of all of the distribution fit results

681

and their resulting chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistics is made available in the supplemental materials.

682
683

We also performed this permutation significance estimation for the haplotype-derived SNP sets although

684

the distances for all loci chosen using that method are below the minimum in this analysis of 40Kb so

685

those results are constant with regards to distance (Figures S3a-b). The chosen α for the LD-derived SNP

686

sets is 0.01 and 0.0075 for April and May, respectively.

687
688

Haplotype block-based selection of SNPs

689

We identified haplotype blocks based on linkage disequilibrium within the UK Biobank data genotype

690

data of the 337,147 subjects using PLINK1.9, where the lower 90% confidence interval is greater than

691

0.70 and the upper 90% confidence interval is at least 0.98. We identified blocks of interests, and

692

subsequently the variants within those blocks, as those that contain any part of the genes of interest as

693

denoted by the transcriptional start and end sites from the hg19 build of the human genome. From the

694

805,426 variants profiles in the UK Biobank genotype data, we identified 7,281 variants within the genes

695

of interest. After applying additional QC filters using PLINK2, 936 variants remained for analysis.

696
697

Software

698

We used PLINK v2.00a2LM 64-bit Intel (26 Aug 2019) to run the genetic association analysis. We used

699

PLINK v1.90b6.10 64-bit (17 Jun 2019) to identify haplotype blocks based on linkage disequilibrium. We

700

used Jupyter Notebooks (jupyter-client version 5.3.4 and jupyter-core version 4.6.1) running Python 3.7,

701

numpy 1.18.1, and scipy 1.4.1 for the permutation analyses.
