Aim: To explore sick leave after COVID-19, by comparing doctor-certified sick leave for up
to 6 months after testing for SARS-CoV-2 across employees who tested positive and negative.
Methods: In all persons (20-70 year of age) with an employment contract, who were tested
for the SARS-CoV-2 in Norway from March 1st to November 1st 2020 (N=740 182 with
mean [SD] age 39 [13] years, 44% men), we used a difference-in-difference design to contrast
doctor-certified sick leave before and after testing, across employees with negative test and
positive test by age and sex groups.
Results: Sick leave for those testing positive (N=11 414) remained elevated for up to 2
months after testing when compared to those testing negative (N= 728 768), for men and
women aged 20-44 and for men aged 45-70 years (relative increase in sick-leave ~344-415%,
(Ball strata=0.079, 95% CI=0.076, 0.082). The increase in sick leave was prolonged for women
aged 45-70 years only, persisting for up to 4 months after testing positive (relative increase =
35%, B=0.010, 95% CI=0.004-0.035).
Conclusion: Sick leave following COVID-19 is elevated for up to two to four months after
initial infection, thereafter not elevated compared with employees who tested negative for
COVID-19. Women aged 45-70 years tend to have a larger impact of COVID-19 on their
work ability than men and younger women.

Introduction
COVID-19 has in several studies been reported to lead to severe long-term health
consequences such as respiratory and circulatory dysfunction among those who were
hospitalized for the initial disease. Although mild COVID-19 seems to have few long-term
consequences for the use of health care services (1), patient-reported complaints such as
fatigue, shortness of breath and musculoskeletal pain are common also after mild initial
infection (2, 3). Thus, both severe and mild COVID-19 may be hypothesized to lead to
temporary or permanent loss of work ability.
The extent to which work ability is affected for the large number of employees going through
COVID-19 is currently unknown. Understanding the impacts of long-covid on the work force
is important for informing on the continuation of strict lockdown and disease control
measures when those at risk of death to an increasing extent are vaccinated. Because longterm loss of work ability will be far more costly than short contacts with health care,
improved understanding of sick leave rates following COVID-19 is important when assessing
the societal costs of the pandemic.
Both the prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 and the prevalence of sick-leave are known
to greatly vary with age and sex (4, 5), and it may be hypothesized that women and the elderly
are worse off regarding their work ability after having undergone COVID-19, than men and
younger persons. Thus, we aimed to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on sick leave for up to
6 months after testing positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, for all employees in Norway
stratified by age and sex.
Methods
Design & data sources
We utilized population-wide longitudinal registry data for all employees in Norway to
estimate the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on sick leave by applying an observational prepost design with a comparison group. The BeredtC19-register is an emergency preparedness
register. Its main aim is to provide rapid knowledge about the pandemic and its
countermeasures. It includes data from the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases
(MSIS) (every polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway), the
Norway Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement (KUHR) Database (all consultations
with all general practitioners and emergency primary health care including doctor-certified
sick leave), the National Population Register (age, sex, country of birth, date of death), the
Norwegian Patient Register (all in- and outpatient hospital contacts), as well as the Employerand Employee-register. The individual level data are linked over time and across data sources
by the unique personal identification number provided every Norwegian resident at birth or
upon immigration.
The establishment of an emergency preparedness register forms part of the legally mandated
responsibilities of The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) during epidemics.
Institutional board review was conducted, and The Ethics Committee of South-East Norway
confirmed (June 4th 2020, #153204) that external ethical board review was not required.
Population
Our population included every Norwegian resident on January 1st 2020 who had at least one
employment contract of more than 1 weekly working hour, and had been tested for SARSCoV-2 by a PCR-test from March 1st to November 1st 2020 (non-residents, e.g. tourists, could

not be included). We constructed the dataset so that we could follow the employee for at least
two months before and at least three months after the test.
COVID-19
We studied all employees with a PCR-tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway, contrasting
employees who tested positive with employees who tested negative (using the first available
test date).
Outcomes
Our outcome was doctor-certified (all-cause) sick leave in a given week. We used the
reimbursement code L1 as reported from every physician in primary care (general
practitioners and emergency wards). All Norwegian employees, both in the public and the
private sector, are mandatory members of the national sick leave insurance scheme, which
ensures full reimbursement of earnings lost due to sickness up to a generous ceiling and
limited to one year. Sickness absence for more than 3 days (private sector), sometimes 7 or
more (public sector), needs to be certified by a medical doctor. Because employees who stop
working (if e.g. hospitalized with COVID-19 or laid off) do not need physician-certified sick
leave, we also studied all-cause health care contacts as outcome (primary, outpatient and
inpatient specialist care).
Statistical analyses
After drawing initial plots of raw data for the entire sample, we used a difference-indifference approach (6,7) to study the weekly change in sick leave rates from 3 months prior
to test week, to 6 months after test week across employees with no COVID-19 (negative test)
and with COVID-19 (positive test).
To estimate the impact of COVID-19 on sick leave, we used a standard difference-indifferences regression model with sick leave as the outcome variable (6,7). The main
independent variables captured, first, that the individual was in the group that had tested
positive (vs. negative), and, second, that the doctor-certified sick leave (dependent variable)
occurred in the given period after test week (vs. all 3 months before test week). The
interactions between these two sets of independent variables are the classical difference-indifferences estimator, capturing the absolute impact (in percentage points) of COVID-19 on
the sick rate. We also calculated the relative impact by dividing the absolute impact estimate
by the sick leave rate of those testing negative in the period before test week. We allowed for
correlations across multiple observations for the same individual over time (clustered standard
errors) and adjusted for the following potential confounders: Comorbidities (categories 0, 1, 2
or 3 or more comorbidities) based on risk conditions for COVID-19 defined by an expert
panel (8), birth country (Norway/abroad) and calendar month (12 categories). The differencesin-difference model was run for the following strata of age and sex: Men 20-44 years, women
20-44 years, men 45-70 years and women 45-70 years.
In addition to providing estimates for the impact of COVID-19 on sick leave 0-2 months, 3-4
months and 5-6 months after the test, we also used the model to present plots with rates of
sick leave for those with and without COVID-19 by 4-weeks periods before and after the test,
by our groups of age and sex. We repeated the analyses using all-cause health care contacts as
outcome (primary, outpatient and inpatient specialist care) to explore the probability that our
analyses of sick leave were affected by healthy worker selection bias. All analyses were run in
STATA MP v.16.

Results
We studied in total 740 182 employees of which 11 414 (1.54 percent) tested positive. Of
these, and among 209 984 men aged 20-44 years and 114 052 men aged 45-70 years, 1.9
percent and 2.0 percent tested positive, respectively. Among 268 259 women aged 20-44
years 1.31 percent tested positive and among 147 887 women aged 45-70 years 1.2 percent
tested positive. For all the strata, employees who tested positive were more often born abroad
(33 percent) than employees with a negative test (45 percent men and 16 percent born
abroad).
Figure 1 shows that employees testing positive had a sick leave of 2.5 percent in the 3 months
before testing positive, increasing to 28.5 percent in the test week and dropped to pre-testing
levels at month 3 (2.8 percent) and 4 (2.2 percent) after testing. Employees testing negative
had 2.0 percent sick leave in the 3 months before testing, increasing to 9.0 percent in the test
week, and returning toward pre-testing level in month 3 (2.6 percent) and 4 (2.5 percent) after
testing (Figure 1). Possibly related to the pandemic and measures taken to contain it, we thus
note that, aside from the couple of months around testing, sick leave remains similar from
before testing (2.5 percent) to 5-6 months after testing (2.4 percent) for those who tested
positive, but in line with the overall increase in sick leave in Norway during the pandemic (9),
it increased somewhat for those who tested negative (2.0 percent to 2.7 percent).
In our differences-in-differences model, we estimated an increase by 7.9 percentage points
(see Table 1, upper left cell) in the period 0-2 months after testing positive. Compared with
the baseline sick leave rate of 2.0 percent (cf. previous paragraph) for those testing negative in
the three months before the testing week, the estimate suggests a relative increase of 392
percent (7.9/2.0). However, at 3-4 months after the test week, the sick leave was similar (-2
percent relative difference) to those who tested negative (Table 1).
Similar patterns were observed for all the mutually exclusive sex and age groups (Figure 2,
Table 1), except for women aged 45-70 years. Their sick leave was elevated 0-2 months after
the test (483 percent relative difference) and remained elevated in the months 3-4 after the test
(35 percent relative difference) (Figure 2, Table 1). Our analyses of all-cause health care use,
in which we explored the potential for healthy worker selection bias showed similar results as
our main analyses, implying that our sick leave estimates are not seriously biased by e.g. more
non-employment among those testing positive (E-Table 1, E-Figure 1).

Discussion
In all Norwegian employees who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N=740 182), we find that the
sick leave of employees testing positive was elevated compared to those testing negative for
about two months after infection for young and older men. For women, the excessive sick
leave of those testing positive compared to those testing negative depended on age, i.e. there
was a short-term elevation in sick leave (up to 2 months) for women aged 20-44 years, and a
short- and long-term elevation in sick leave (up to 4 months) for women aged 45-70 years.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore short- and long-term impacts of COVID19 on sick leave for employees. Important strengths of our study are the prospective design
and use of data that include all employees who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in an entire
country. Another strength is that we could contrast the post-covid sick leave with pre-covid
sick leave for the same employee. Thus, by studying the months around the week of testing,
and comparing with everyone who tested negative, we could effectively adjust for both timeinvariant individual characteristics and seasonal variations in sick leave, transmission and
policy measures – including those work-place related - to stop the pandemic.
Whereas several studies have explored the impacts of COVID-19 on long-term health and
health care use, especially for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we are the first to study
impacts on sick leave for the vast majority of employees with non-severe initial infection. We
believe that sick leave in this group is an important outcome when assessing the total impacts
of the pandemic. Though personal and societal costs are large for the patients hospitalized
with COVID-19, the sum of these costs may turn out to be modest compared with the overall
societal costs of even limited long-term loss of work ability. In our data, for example, of a
total of 11 414 employees testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 544 were hospitalized with
COVID-19, and 543 had a minimum of one episode of doctor-diagnosed sick leave with the
disease. In this way, the current study sheds new and important light on outcomes that are
highly relevant both for the individual health and for society. For example, our findings of a
more long-term impact on sick leave among older female employees than among other ages
and sex groups, may be important information for employers who are required to facilitate
workers in their return to work. The current study shows that adjusting work task or work
hours may be particularly important for older female employees who contract COVID-19, to
prevent a lengthy sick leave period.
Our study has several important limitations. First, we have no information regarding the
length of the sick leave spells. Thus, we cannot study how long an employee is on sick leave,
potentially explaining the lower level of sick leave found in our sample than what is reported
in official statistics (9). However, doctor-certified sick leave must be renewed regularly, often
every fortnight, when symptoms are vague like those typically reported for long-covid (4,10).
Moreover, our investigation of potential selection bias due to post-covid non-employment
shows that health-care consultations for any cause are affected in a similar way as sick leave
(E-Figure 1). This suggests that our sick leave estimates are not seriously biased by e.g. more
non-employment among those testing positive. A second limitation may be that we could only
include doctor-certified sick leave. In the first 3- or 7-day periods of sick leave, the employee
can call in sick without doctor-certification. Thus, we may have underestimated any change in
sick leave for short-term spells.
In conclusion, we find that COVID-19 does not elevate sick leave beyond 2 months after
testing positive, at least for men aged 20-70 years and for women aged 20-44 years, whereas
women aged 45-70 years had elevated sick leave for up to 4 months after testing positive.
