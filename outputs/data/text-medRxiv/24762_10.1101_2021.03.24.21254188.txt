Abstract

1

2

There is a consensus that mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will ultimately end the COVID-19 pandemic.

3

However, it is not clear when and which control measures can be relaxed during the rollout of vaccination

4

programmes. We investigate relaxation scenarios using an age-structured transmission model that has been fitted

5

to age-specific seroprevalence data, hospital admissions, and projected vaccination coverage for Portugal. Our

6

analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities could lead to new pandemic waves,

7

and that substantial control efforts prove necessary throughout 2021. Using knowledge on control measures

8

introduced in 2020, we anticipate that relaxing measures completely or to the extent as in autumn 2020 could

9

launch a wave starting in April 2021. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures are relaxed

10

as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021. We discuss at which point control of COVID-19

11

would be achieved for each scenario.

Introduction

13

Mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 that started in Europe in December 2020/January 2021 [1] brings hope

14

that the COVID-19 pandemic will end in 2021. Although the progress towards this goal is on the right track [2],

15

many governments in Europe continue limiting socioeconomic activities to control the pandemic. Despite elaborate

16

national vaccination schedules, it remains unclear when and which control measures can be relaxed and at which

17

point the control of the pandemic will be achieved as the vaccination is rolled out in 2021. The understanding

18

of how relaxation policies might affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is further hampered by the emergence of

19

novel variants [3, 4] that have a selective advantage, such as increased transmissibility [5–7] or the ability to reduce

20

rapid neutralisation by the host [8]. For example, the current restrictions in Europe [9] are in part caused by a

21

more transmissible [5–7] and potentially more pathogenic [10, 11] B.1.1.7 variant that originated in the UK and is

22

quickly gaining dominance in other countries including Portugal [12, 13].

23

The vaccines that have been approved in Europe [14] show consistently high efficacy against severe disease, hospi-

24

talization and death in trials [15–17] and equally high effectiveness in real-world settings [18–22]. Multiple studies

25

are under way to establish infection-blocking properties of these vaccines. Preliminary analyses of the national vac-

26

cination programme in Israel indicate that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against asymptomatic

27

SARS-CoV-2 infections could be as high as 94% [21], as announced recently by the Israel Ministry of Health, Pfizer

28

Inc and BioNTech SE. The recent Danish cohort study on long-term care facility residents and healthcare workers

29

suggests that the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine based on a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is

30

64% and 90% beyond seven days of second dose in the two groups, respectively [19]. Similar results were found

31

in a study among healthcare workers in England where the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against

32

symptomatic and asymptomatic infection was 86% seven days after two doses [22]. Based on the data from Israel,

33

the effectiveness of the same vaccine against infection with SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be 51% 13-24 days after one

34

dose [20]. Finally, in an analytical study by Lipsitch et al [23], the lower bound for the efficacy against transmission

35

for one dose of Moderna vaccine was estimated at 61% but it could possibly be considerably higher, especially after

36

two doses.

37

The consequences of relaxing control measures such as e.g., physical distancing, school closure, mask-wearing, test-

38

and-trace and isolation, will depend on several factors, including the properties of vaccines deployed in a given

39

country, specific vaccination schedules and speeds of vaccine rollout, but also the past epidemiology of SARS-CoV-

40

2 that defines a proportion of the population protected after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection [24, 25]. All these

41

factors are naturally country-dependent and will play a major role in how the pandemic will develop under different

42

relaxation scenarios [26–29] and how quickly the control of COVID-19 will be gained in specific countries throughout

43

2021 and possibly beyond. To make a few distinctive examples, we recall Israel which has the highest vaccination

44

rate worldwide so that, on average, every person has received at least one vaccine dose by mid-March 2021 [1]

45

and Manaus in Brazil, where the levels of protection by natural infection close to the theoretical herd immunity

46

threshold were achieved prior to the start of mass vaccination [30].

47

An extensive body of literature addresses the challenges of modelling real-time fast-moving COVID-19 pandemic [31].

48

Mathematical transmission models robustly calibrated to available data are among the best tools available to provide

49

input into the discussion on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic [32–43] and they will continue to play an

50

important role in making decisions surrounding the relaxation of measures in 2021 [26–29]. Several modeling

51

studies provided support for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and early planning of vaccination scenarios

52

and rollouts [44–48], but these models typically assumed that a large proportion of the population is vaccinated

53

instantaneously and/or did not focus on relaxation strategies. More recently, organized teams of modeling experts

54

supporting decision-makers over health emergencies in China and the UK evaluated the roadmap scenarios for

55

relaxation of control measures in these countries in light of ongoing mass vaccination [26–28].

56

The present study makes a contribution towards better understanding of when and which control measures can be

57

relaxed as mass vaccination programmes progress in 2021. We take Portugal as a case study where good quality data

58

for model parameterization are available but, apart from efforts of genomic surveillance [49], there are no dedicated

59

COVID-19 modeling studies for informing policymaking in this country [50]. Using an age-structured transmission

60

model that has been fitted in a Bayesian framework to the data from various sources (age-specific hospitalizations

61

and seroprevalence, social contact and demographic data, national vaccination plan and vaccine rollout data etc.),

62

we investigate future pandemic trajectories under several alternative relaxation scenarios throughout 2021. Among

63

the explored relaxation strategies are lifting measures to the same extent as in summer 2020 and later on in autumn

64

2020, the complete lifting of measures and combinations of these. We evaluate the impact of each scenario on

65

the epidemic dynamics as quantified by projected hospital admissions, the time-dependent effective reproduction

66

number, population immunization level due to natural infection and vaccination, and timing of reaching control

67

of COVID-19 in Portugal. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the post-pandemic dynamics of

Figure 1. Model fit to COVID-19 hospitalizations. The age-stratified daily hospital admission data are
shown as red dots. The median trajectories estimated from the model are shown as the black lines. The gray
shaded regions correspond to 95% Bayesian prediction intervals based on 2,000 parameter samples from the
posterior distribution. Hospital admissions were estimated for 10 age groups (see Methods). For presentation
purposes, here we grouped hospitalizations for ages [0,5), [5,10), [10,20).

72

January 2021 and cross-sectional age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data assessed from 21 May 2020 till 8

73

July 2020. The model reproduces well the age-specific hospital admissions (Figure 1) featuring (i) the first pandemic

74

wave (March-April 2020), (ii) relatively low epidemic activity (May-August 2020), (iii) the second pandemic wave

75

(September-mid-December 2020), (iv) the third wave that started in mid-December 2020 and was still ongoing on

76

15 January 2021 [51]. The estimated hospitalization rates increase with age from 0.12 (95%CrI 0.07-0.23) per year

77

for children under 5 years of age to 14.24 (95%CrI 9.91–21.23) per year for persons above 80 years (Figure S1). In

78

agreement with other studies [52, 53], the estimated susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 increases with age (Figure S2).

79

The meaning of model parameters is given in Tables S2 and S4, and their estimates are shown in Figures S1 and

80

S2.

81

The model also reproduces well the age-specific and total seroprevalence in the population (Figure 2). The estimated

82

age-specific seroprevalence ranged between 1.77% (95%CrI 0.98–2.91%) for 1 to 10 years old children to 4.61%

(95%CrI 3.47–5.91%) for 20 to 40 years old adults (Figure 2 a). The total seroprevalence steadily increased with

Figure 2. Model fit to SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. a Age-specific seroprevalence. b Total seroprevalence.
The data (dots and error bars) are based on the cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey (First National
Serological Survey) conducted after the first pandemic wave [54]. a The violin shapes represent the marginal
posterior distribution of the age-specific seroprevalence in the model. b The black line and the gray shaded region
show the median total seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals. The uncertainty in the model is based on 2,000
parameter samples from the posterior distribution. The total seroprevalence refers to population older than 1
year [54].

85

Time-varying contact patterns and effective reproduction number

86

We estimated how age-specific contact rates in the population changed due to control measures as the pandemic

87

developed. These contact rates denote the average number of transmission-relevant contacts per day a person in

88

a given age category has with persons in other age categories. We further calculated the time-dependent effective

89

reproduction number, Re (t), defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious indi-

90

vidual in the population with age-specific contact patterns and age-specific seroprevalence at time t. Re (t) < 1

91

signifies the control of the pandemic with possibly some of control measures in place. The full control of COVID-19

92

is achieved when Re (t) < 1 and the contact rates in the population are restored to the pre-pandemic level.

93

Our findings are summarized in Figure 3, where we show the total daily hospitalizations (Figure 3 a), the average

94

(over all ages) number of daily contacts in the population (Figure 3 b) and Re (t) (Figure 3 c) evaluated bi-weekly

95

in the period from 26 February 2020 till 15 January 2021. The green vertical lines indicate the estimated mid-point

96

transitions in the age-specific contact rates (see Methods). The pre-pandemic average number of daily contacts was

97

12.6. The estimated basic reproduction number (in the absence of control measures and with zero seroprevalence)

was 2.20 (95%CrI 1.97–2.56). The control measures introduced during the first wave in spring 2020 reduced the

99

number of contacts to 4.2 (95%CrI 3.3–5.0) and Re to 0.69 (95%CrI 0.64—0.75). After some of these measures were

100

lifted, the number of contacts increased to 5.9 (95%CrI 5.1–6.6) and Re increased to almost 1 and stayed nearly

101

constant throughout summer 2020. At the start of the second wave in autumn 2020 that followed the opening of

102

schools and the associated changes in the contact patterns of the rest of the population, the average number of

103

contacts further increased to about 7.6 (95%CrI 6.7–8.3) and Re to 1.24 (95%CrI 1.21–1.28). The reinforcement of

104

measures during the second wave could only reduce Re to 0.89 (95%CrI 0.86–0.99) as compared to Re of 0.69 after

105

more severe measures introduced during the first wave. Finally, the increased activity of the population around

106

Christmas and the New Year 2021 initiated the third wave in January 2021.

∗ The

Portuguese vaccination plan assumes that all persons in the population will be vaccinated with a two-dose vaccine schedule. In
the model, the maximum vaccination coverage in any age group is 90%. ∗∗ According to the current guidelines, persons under 18 years
old are not eligible for vaccination. In the model, we assumed that the age group of 0 to 20 years old is not vaccinated.

107

Vaccination rollout

108

We implemented the rollout of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as set out by the Directorate-General of Health —

109

a division of Portuguese Ministry of Health concerned with public health (Table 1). The mass vaccination started

110

on 27 December 2020, is planned to proceed in three phases that will cover the whole population of Portugal

111

by 31 December 2021. In the model, we made several simplifying assumptions regarding vaccination, i.e. 1) at

112

most 90% of each age group will be vaccinated (as supported by the survey conducted between 23 January and 5

113

February 2021 on the willingness to get vaccinated where the percentage of the Portuguese residents who want to get

114

vaccinated exceeds 95% [55]) except for persons under 20 years of age (as supported by the current guidelines on the

115

ineligibility for vaccination of persons under 18 years of age); 2) the distributed vaccine is by BioNTech/Pfizer brand

116

(as supported by the recent ECDC vaccination data for Portugal where 96% of vaccine doses distributed up until

117

February 21, 2021 are by BioNTech/Pfizer); 3) vaccination is modelled as a single event that immediately confers

118

protection equivalent to two vaccine doses; 4) we considered an infection-blocking vaccine and formulated optimistic

119

(main results) and pessimistic (sensitivity analyses) assumptions for vaccine efficacies in reducing infection, disease

120

and severe disease; 5) there is no waning of protection against (re-)infection after natural infection and vaccination.

121

More details of the vaccination model are given in Methods.

122

We used the rollout schedule (Table 1) and data (Figure 4 a) on the age distribution of morbidities among the

123

Portuguese residents and age distribution of prioritized vaccination categories (e.g., healthcare workers, long-term

care facilities staff and residents etc.) to calculate age-specific vaccination rates (number of persons in a given

125

age group vaccinated per day) as the vaccination programme progresses (Figure 4 b; see Figure S3 for detailed

126

information). The vaccination rate refers to vaccination with two vaccine doses. The maximum vaccination coverage

127

of 90% is projected to be reached in the following order (Figure 5 a): 80+ (29 June 2021), [60,80) (20 July–23 July

128

2021), [50,60) (29 August 2021) and [20,50) (16 November 2021) (see Figure S4 for absolute numbers of vaccinated

129

persons). The total coverage in the population will increase to 9%/38%/73% (maximum coverage) by 1 May/1

130

August/16 November 2021 (Figure 4 b). The ECDC vaccination rollout data for Portugal agree well with these

131

projections.

132

Scenarios for relaxation of control measures

133

To account for the epidemiological situation in Portugal between mid-January and mid-March 2021 [51], we modeled

134

the third wave of hospitalizations that was curbed by the substantial reinforcement of measures similar to those

135

implemented during the first wave in spring 2020. We also modelled an increase in the transmisibility of the virus due

136

to the rapid spread of B.1.1.7. variant in Portugal. The situation in mid-march 2021 is then described by the average

137

number of daily contacts of 4.2, Re of 0.67 and the circulating variant that is 50% more transmissible [5–7] than

138

the original variant that was dominant in Portugal until December 2020. Starting from this situation, we generated

139

scenarios for relaxation of control measures as follows (Figure 6): Scenario 1) lifting all measures so that contact

140

rates in the population return to the pre-pandemic level (average rate of 12.6 contacts/day); Scenario 2) partial

141

lifting of measures that increases contact rates to the level of September-October 2020 (7.6 contacts/day); Scenario

142

3) partial lifting of measures that increases contact rates to the level of June-August 2020 (5.9 contacts/day). In

143

accordance with the plan of the Portuguese government to alleviate some of the current measures in spring 2021

144

and to make the scenarios comparable, we used the same mid-point (1 April 2021) and the same speed of transition

145

between the contact levels (10 days).

146

The comparative analysis of Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 is shown in Figure 6. The model predicts that lifting all measures

147

(Scenario 1; Figure 6 a-d) launches a fourth wave that is significantly larger than the previous waves, resulting in

148

58,226 cumulative hospitalizations between 1 April and 1 January 2022 (Figure 6 a). Re increases sharply from

149

0.67 on 23 March 2021 to 2.03 two weeks later (Figure 6 c) which is very close to the basic reproduction number of

150

2.20 at the start of the pandemic. The full control over COVID-19 is reached on 18 May 2021 when Re drops below

151

1 and the contact rates are the pre-pandemic level (Figure 6 b). At this threshold, 60% of the population acquired

152

protection after natural infection and only 10% are protected after vaccination (Figure 6 d). Relaxing measures

153

according to Scenario 2 (Figure 6 e-h) initiates a new pandemic wave too, albeit smaller in magnitude than Scenario

154

1 (8,975 hospitalizations between 1 April and 1 January 2022; Figure 6 e). In this case, Re becomes smaller than

155

1 on 29 June 2021 (Figure 6 g) but the measures have to be kept in place (Figure 6 f ) to control the spread. The

156

increase of contact rates to the level of June-August 2020 (Scenario 3; Figure 6 i-l), however, does not lead to a rise

in hospitalizations (Figure 6 i) because Re stays below 1 (Figure 6 k) but, like in Scenario 2, the measures have to

158

continue until sufficient number of people acquire protection by vaccination to relax them completely.

159

In addition, we explored Scenario 4 (Figure 7) where measures are relaxed in a step-wise manner so that contact

160

rates first rise to the level of June-August 2020 (Step 1, Scenario 3), then to the level of September-October 2020

161

(Step 2, Scenario 2) and, finally, to the pre-pandemic level (Step 3, Scenario 1) (Figure 7 b). The mid-points of

162

transitions were 1 April, 1 June and 1 October 2021 (blue vertical lines in Figure 7) and the relaxation speed of 10

163

days was used for all transitions. In this scenario, additional waves can be prevented altogether and hospitalizations

164

stay at the level comparable to that in summer 2020 when the epidemic activity was low (Figure 7 a). Interestingly,

165

Step 2 (1 June) and Step 3 (1 October) increase Re above 1 (Figure 7 c) leading to waves of infections (Figure S5)

Average contacts (1/day)

Hospitalizations (1/day)

Scenario 4

Figure 7. Sequential relaxation of control measures. This scenario consists of sequential relaxation of
measures so that the contact rates increase, in sequence, to the level of June-August 2020, of September-October
2020 and the pre-pandemic level. The blue vertical lines indicate the mid-points of these transitions (1 April, 1
June, 1 October). The gray vertical lines indicate the starting dates for different vaccination phases (Table 1).
The red horizontal line denotes Re = 1. The hospitalization data are shown as red dots. The thick solid lines are
the median trajectories estimated from the model. The gray shaded regions correspond to 95% credible intervals.

166

but a large increase in hospitalizations is not observed because a substantial proportion of the vulnerable population

167

has been vaccinated (Figure 5). The full control of the pandemic (Re (t) < 1 and pre-pandemic contact rates) is

168

reached on 8 February 2022 (Figure 7 c) when 36% of the population are protected after natural infection, 48%

169

after vaccination, and 17% stay unprotected (Figure 7 d). This is drastically different from Scenario 1, where the

170

control was reached mainly due to protection through natural infection (60%), and the minority was protected by

171

vaccination (10%).

172

Finally, we would like to stress that for demonstration purposes the timings of Steps 2 and 3 in Scenario 4 have

173

been intentionally chosen so that the epidemic activity (i.e., the number of hospital admissions) in 2021 is similar

174

to that in summer 2020. The premature relaxation of measures can still lead to new waves of hospitalizations. We

175

demonstrate this in Figure S6 where Step 3 occurs on 1 August instead of 1 October 2021. Similarly, the results

176

presented for Scenario 4 (and other scenarios as well) are the most optimistic in terms of projected hospitalizations

177

and get worse for a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies or if individuals return to pre-pandemic contact rates

178

immediately upon getting vaccinated (see Figure S7).

Discussion

180

In this study, we used an age-structured model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission to generate several scenarios for

181

relaxation of control measures during the ongoing vaccination rollout in Portugal. In agreement with the plans

182

of the Portuguese government, the mid-point of easing of measures is April 2021. Our analyses demonstrate that

183

vaccination alone, if rolled out according to the national vaccination schedule, is likely to be insufficient to control

184

the Portuguese pandemic when control measures are significantly alleviated in April 2021. Returning to the pre-

185

pandemic lifestyle already in spring 2021 is the worst-case scenario that would be detrimental for the healthcare

186

system. Even for the most optimistic model assumptions, this scenario would result in a wave of hospitalizations

187

several orders of magnitude larger than the three previous waves. Relaxing measures to the same extent as in

188

autumn 2020 would lead to somewhat smaller wave (as compared to the worst-case scenario and even to the third

189

wave that actually occurred) that would, nonetheless, present a significant burden for the national healthcare.

190

These findings are qualitatively similar to those in modeling studies for China [28] and the UK [26, 27], but the

191

quantitative comparison is not possible because of different settings and contexts in which those studies were

192

conducted. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures in spring 2021 are relaxed to the same

193

extent as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021.

194

The point at which the pandemic is brought under full control (Re (t) < 1 and pre-pandemic contact patterns)

195

depends on the amount of protection in the population acquired through a combination of natural infection and

196

vaccination. Gaining the control quickly (by mid-May 2021) occurs mainly through protection by natural infection

197

(60% of the population) while the minority (10%) would be protected by vaccination. As mentioned above, this

198

worst-case scenario is, obviously, undesirable and is not very much different from letting the pandemic develop

199

without any control measures. In the gradual relaxation scenario, achieving control takes more than one year

200

since the start of vaccination rollout, but almost 50% of the population are protected by vaccination and a smaller

201

proportion (35%) have experienced SARS-CoV-2 by that point. Alternative to these scenarios would be accelerating

202

the vaccination campaign so that vaccination coverage increases faster than initially projected and confirmed by

203

the ECDC vaccination rollout data [2]. However, it is not clear whether this option is viable for Portugal given the

204

current shortage for COVID-19 vaccines.

205

A strength of our analyses is that we calculate the effective reproduction number using the estimated current levels

206

of age-specific seroprevalence and vaccination coverage in the population instead of reducing the value of Re at

207

the beginning of the pandemic homogeneously across age groups as it is done in e.g. the study for China [28].

208

Another strength is that, unlike this study [28] and the studies for the UK [26, 27], the parameters of our model

209

are statistically evaluated to match the course of the Portuguese pandemic as reflected by age-specific hospital

210

admissions and age-specific seroprevalence [54]. In addition, our fitting procedure allows for estimation of temporal

211

changes in age-dependent contact patterns as a response to prior control measures during this pandemic. Therefore,

212

instead of modeling specific relaxation policies, that are notoriously hard to implement in mechanistic transmission

213

models, we model several scenarios using the estimated contact structure after relaxation of measures in summer

214

and autumn 2020.

215

In light of these past measures, our findings are easy to interpret and contain an important message for local

216

policymakers. School opening is thought to be the main driver of the changes observed in autumn 2020, although

217

an increase in socializing indoors in general caused by weather alone must also have played a role. If the relaxation

218

planned for April 2021 includes school reopening in full after Easter and resuming indoor service in restaurants and

219

bars, then it is very likely that the average contact rate in the population will reach levels very similar to those

220

in autumn 2020. As a consequence, this might lead to a new wave of hospitalizations as illustrated in Scenario

221

2. On the bright side, according to our analysis the goal of Scenario 3, in which major waves are avoided, seems

222

well within reach, given the light control measures that were in place during summer 2020. Combining these with

223

some additional limitations of indoor social activities and online classes for secondary school students could help to

224

replicate the average contact rate of summer 2020, compensating for opening of elementary schools.

225

As any model, our model has limitations. An important one is that protection against (re-)infection after natural

226

infection and vaccination is permanent over the time-scale of our analyses (almost two years). This frequently

227

used assumption [26–28, 44, 47] leads to that in our model, theoretically, SARS-CoV-2 can be eliminated from the

228

population. However, as we discussed recently [56] and as addressed in several conceptual modeling studies [57–59],

229

accumulating evidence suggests that after the initial pandemic phase SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be transitioning to

230

endemicity and continued circulation. Specifically, recent data from individual-level studies point to that detectable

231

levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 providing immunity against reinfection can wane on the time scale of a few

232

months to few years following exposure, as shown by our group [60] and corroborated with findings of other

233

studies [61–63]. However, the immunity to SARS-CoV-2 depending on a combination of B- and T-cell-mediated

234

responses elicited during primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could reduce susceptibility to and infectiousness of the

235

following infections and offer protection against severe disease, i.e. COVID-19 [64]. The estimation of the model

236

parameters and evaluation of relaxation strategies in light of waning of sterilizing immunity lies outside the scope

237

of our study but it should be addressed in future work when convincing data on reinfections in unvaccinated and

238

vaccinated individuals become available.

239

Another limitation is that our results are based on early data on the efficacy in clinical trials and real-world

240

effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine [15, 18–22]. We also assume that vaccine efficacy against the B.1.1.7

241

variant circulating in Portugal is the same as the efficacy reported from studies conducted in other locations as

242

supported by the recent study among working age adults in England [22], where the dominant variant in circulation

243

was B.1.1.7. This study demonstrated that effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic and

244

asymptomatic infection is 86% seven days after two doses [22]. However, SARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination programmes

245

and prolonged control measures can generate selection pressure leading to viral adaptation, antigenic divergence

246

or vaccine escape. Viral adaptations may contribute to decreasing efficacy of existing vaccines via faster waning

247

of sterilizing immunity. For example, recent experiments demonstrate that the South African variant B.1.351

248

shows reduced neutralizing antibody binding increasing the prospects of reinfection and hampering the efficacy of

249

spike-based vaccines [65]. This will need consideration in vaccine development and evaluation of future vaccination

250

programmes and relaxation scenarios in mathematical transmission models. A possible case where an antigenic

251

escape variant caused a resurgence of COVID-19 despite high population-level seroprevalence was observed in

252

Manaus, Brazil [30].

253

To summarize, our study provides timely input into the discussion about the pandemic response during the vacci-

254

nation rollout in Portugal. Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities might

255

lead to new waves of hospitalizations in 2021 and that substantial measures prove necessary to control COVID-19

256

throughout 2021. More favourable scenarios that help to avoid future waves include relaxation of measures as in

257

summer 2020 or a step-wise approach when measures are relaxed gradually until the end of 2021.

258

Methods

259

Overview

260

The transmission model was calibrated using a combination of behavioral, surveillance and demographic data for

261

Portugal. Parameter estimates were obtained from the model fit to (i) age-stratified COVID-19 hospitalization

262

data (n = 28, 482) in the period from 26 February 2020 till 15 January 2021 and (ii) cross-sectional age-stratified

263

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data (n = 2, 301) assessed from 21 May 2020 till 8 July 2020 [54]. The model was

264

further used to investigate relaxation scenarios as vaccination is rolled out in 2021.

265

Data

266

The hospitalization data included n = 28, 482 COVID-19 hospitalizations longer than 24 hours by date of admission

267

and stratified by age during the period of 325 days following the first official case in Portugal (2 March 2020). The

268

data was padded with 5 days without hospitalizations (from 26 February till 1 March 2020) to allow for the

269

estimation of the number of infected individuals at the start of the pandemic. The hospitalization data spanned the

270

first wave in spring 2020, relatively low epidemic activity in summer 2020, the second wave that started in autumn

271

2020 till mid-December 2020 and the third wave that started in mid-December 2020 and was still ongoing on 15

272

January 2021. The data source for hospital data was the Central Administration of the Health System and the

273

Shared Services of the Ministry of Health, covering all public hospitals in Portugal receiving COVID-19 patients.

274

Since early in the pandemic, Portugal adopted a policy of hospitalizing only patients who did not gather minimum

275

conditions for being followed at the domicile, either due to clinical or sanitary conditions. This policy has not

276

changed during the course of the pandemic.

277

The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data was based on the First National Serological Survey (ISNCOVID-19) in

278

Portugal in May/July 2020 [54]. This cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey was conducted on a sample of

279

n = 2, 301 Portuguese residents, aged 1 year or older, after the first wave. The survey sample was selected using a

280

two-stage stratified non-probability sampling design (quota sampling) [54]. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies

281

were measured in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Further details of the study are given

282

in [54]. For the model fitting, we used the sample size, the number of positive samples and 95% confidence intervals

283

stratified by age group reported in [54].

284

The demographic composition of the Portuguese residents was taken for 2019 from the Contemporary Portugal

285

Database (Pordata) [66]. The vaccination analyses made use of the vaccination programme (Table 1), as defined by

286

the Directorate-General of Health [51]. The programme defines vaccine uptake prioritization by age and morbidities

287

and runs in three phases from 27 December 2020 till 31 December 2021. The age distribution of morbidities in the

288

Portuguese population was extracted from the Shared Services of the Ministry of Health on the basis of ICPC-2

289

(International Classification of Primary Care) codes (Table S1). The vaccination rollout data for Portugal was

290

taken from the ECDC website.

291

The baseline (pre-pandemic) contact matrices for transmission-relevant contacts for Portugal were taken from the

292

recent study by Mistry and colleagues [67]. The contact matrix for Portugal after the introduction of measures to

293

control the first wave of hospitalizations (April 2020) was inferred using the contact matrix for the Netherlands

294

based on a cross-sectional survey carried out in April 2020 (PIENTER Corona study) [68].

extended SEIR-type framework. Vaccinated persons may experience behavior compensation post-vaccination
modelled as a return to pre-pandemic contact rates among vaccinated persons as compared to unvaccinated
persons who may continue to have reduced contact rates due to control measures. The vaccine has three effects:
(i) reduction in susceptibility of vaccinated relative to unvaccinated (V ES ); (ii) reduction in infectivity of
vaccinated relative to unvaccinated (V EI , not shown); (iii) reduction in hospitalization rate of vaccinated relative
to unvaccinated (V EH ).

295

Transmission model

296

We extended an age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 transmission model from [43] to include vaccination (Figure 8). The

297

model has susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered structure, whereby susceptible persons (S) may become latently

298

infected (E) before progressing to become infectious (I). Infectious persons either get hospitalized (H) or recover

299

without hospitalization (R). Disease-related mortality and discharge from the hospital are not explicitly modeled.

300

Therefore, the H-compartment contains the cumulative number of persons who experience severe symptoms and

301

recover (or die) after admission to the hospital. Similarly, the R-compartment contains the cumulative number

302

of persons who recover after having mild or no symptoms. The force of infection is given by a weighted sum of

303

the fraction of the infectious population in different age groups (red dashed boxes in Figure 8). We consider a

304

stable population and thus do not include natural birth and death processes. The contact rates, forces of infection,

305

susceptibilities and hospitalization rates are age-specific.

306

In line with the current guidelines, we assume that vaccine can be delivered to all people independently from their

307

disease history with the exception of those who might be currently infectious (I-compartment). Not vaccinating in-

308

fectious compartment implies that vaccine is not given to asymptomatic persons but these represent a small fraction

309

of the population at any given time. We also vaccinate the H-compartment as this compartment comprises everyone

310

who has ever been admitted to hospital. Whilst this assumption means that the currently hospitalized persons are

311

vaccinated too, their number is very small compared to the total number of people in the H-compartment. The

312

vaccine has three mechanisms of action: (i) reducing susceptibility (V ES ); (ii) reducing infectivity (V EI ); (iii)

313

reducing hospitalization rate (V EH ). The vaccine has no effect in persons who recovered from natural infection (R

314

and H compartments). We assume that protection after vaccination is achieved immediately and is equivalent to

315

two vaccine doses, and that the duration of protection after both natural infection and vaccination is about two

316

years (time horizon of our analyses). Finally, we allow for behavior compensation post-vaccination modelled as

317

a return to pre-pandemic contact rates among vaccinated persons as compared to unvaccinated persons who may

318

continue to have reduced contact rates due to control measures. This is reflected in generally different forces of

319

infection for unvaccinated and vaccinated persons. The full description of the model parameters is given in Tables

320

S2 and S4.

321

Model equations

322

The model was implemented in Mathematica 10.0.2.0 using a system of ordinary differential equations for the

323

number of persons in different compartments shown in Figure 1. The transmission model was stratified into n = 10

324

age groups: [0, 5), [5, 10), [10, 20), [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50), [50, 60), [60, 70), [70, 80), 80+.

the fact that the vast majority of people in the H-compartment are recovered after hospitalization, and a very small

351

The initial condition for the model was Ek (t = 0) = Ik (t = 0) = 21 θNk and Sk (t = 0) = (1 − θ)Nk , where t = 0 is

352

26 February 2020. The parameter θ denotes the initial fraction of the population that was infected (split equally

353

between infectious and exposed). This parameter accounts for importation of new cases at the start of the pandemic

354

and was estimated jointly with other parameters. Importation of cases was not implemented at later stages of the

355

pandemic due to a large pool of infectious individuals within the country.

356

The rapid spread of B.1.1.7 variant, that is estimated to be about 50% more transmissible based on the data from

357

England [5–7], fueled the third wave of hospitalizations in Portugal. The increasing dominance of this variant

358

was modelled empirically as a gradual increase in the probably of transmission per contact by 50% as follows

359

[1 + 0.5/(1 + e−K0 (t−tdata ) )], where  and K0 were estimated based on the data until 15 January 2021 (Figure S2)

360

and tdata is the last date in the hospital admission data (15 January 2021).

361

Observation model and parameter estimation

362

To generate a set of plausible parameters and initial conditions for our projections, we fitted the model to hos-

363

pitalization data and serological testing data, using a similar approach as before [43, 69]. We incorporated the

364

transmission model, Eq. (1), in a Bayesian statistical model with likelihood function constructed as follows. Let

365

hk,m denote the observed number of hospitalizations in age group k and day tm . The expected number of hos-

366

pitalizations during day tm is approximately equal to hk,m := νk · Ik (tm ). To account for reporting errors and

367

heterogeneity in the hospitalization rate within age groups, we assume that hk,m has a negative-binomial distri-

368

bution with mean hk,m and variance hk,m · (1 + hk,m /φ). The parameter φ determines the overdispersion of the

369

reporting of hospitalizations. The hospitalization data were stratified into the ten age groups [0, 5), [5, 10), [10, 20),

370

[20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50), [50, 60), [60, 70), [70, 80), 80+.

371

The seroprevalence data were stratified into the five age groups [1, 10), [10, 20), [20, 40), [40, 60) and 60+ [54]. Hence,

372

for the hospitalization data and the transmission model, a finer age stratification is used than for the seroprevalence

373

data. We assume that individuals in seroprevalence age group Gsi were sampled from hospitalization age class Ghk

374

with probability pik proportional to the relative population size of Ghk compared to Gsi , i.e.

375

pik = Nk /Nis ,

where Nis =

As before [43], we assume that the seroprevalence data represents a random sample from each age group. Hence,

377

the number of positive samples `i has a binomial distribution with population size Li , equal to the total number

378

of samples for age class i, and success probability qi . The success probability is defined in terms of the fraction of

381

To account for the fact that no children below the age of 1 year were included in the serology samples, we reduced

382

the population size N1 with the size of the age group [0, 1) (86, 579 persons) in Eq. (6) and Eq. (5).

383

The prior distribution of the model is specified in Table S3. The model was fitted with Stan [70] in R 3.6.0 and R

384

Studio 1.3.1056. We used 4 parallel chains, each of length 1,000, with a warm-up period of 500, resulting in 2,000

385

samples from the posterior distribution. Convergence was assessed with the Gelman-Rubin R̂-statistic, which was

386

close to 1 for all parameters. The estimated model parameters are shown in Figures S1 and S2.

387

Time-varying contact patterns

388

The contact patterns in the population varied with time due to introduction/reinforcement or relaxation of control

389

measures as follows: 0) introduction of measures to control the first pandemic wave (first lockdown, March 2020); 1)

390

relaxation of measures after the first wave was curbed (May 2020); 2) further relaxation of measures that included

391

school opening (September 2020); 3) reinforcement of measures to control the second wave (second lockdown,

392

November 2020); 4) relaxation of measures around Christmas 2020; 5) reinforcement of measures to control the

393

third wave (third lockdown, January 2021).

394

We denote ckl (t) the contact rate for a person in age group k (k = 1, . . . , n) with persons in age group l (l = 1, . . . , n)

395

at time t. The contact rate denotes the number of transmission-relevant contacts per day such as touching or having

396

a conversation with someone [67, 68]. Our fitting procedure allows to estimate ckl (t) by assuming that changes due

397

to control measures described in 0)-5) occur as a series of smooth transitions.

398

To describe the transition 0) from the baseline (pre-pandemic) contact rate bkl to the contact rate after the first

400

lockdown akl we write down ckl (t) as a linear combination of contact rates bkl and akl with coefficients constructed

using a logistic function f0 (t) = 1/ 1 + e−K0 (t−t0 ) as follows

401

ckl (t) = [1 − f0 (t)]bkl + f0 (t)ζakl .

402

The parameter K0 of the logistic function describes the speed with which the first lockdown is enforced. The

403

parameter t0 describes the mid-time of the introduction of the first lockdown. Note in Eq. 7 we introduced the

404

factor ζ ∈ [0, 1] to reflect that not all reported contacts after the first lockdown might be relevant for transmission,

405

for example, due to mask-wearing or physical distancing when a contact took place. Therefore, the baseline (pre-

406

pandemic) contact rates are described by the matrix bkl , and the contact rates after the first lockdown are described

407

by the matrix ζakl .

408

The pre-pandemic matrix bkl for Portugal was taken from [67] (Figure 9 a). The matrix after the first lockdown

409

akl was inferred using the contact matrix for the Netherlands based on a cross-sectional survey carried out in April

410

2020 (PIENTER Corona study) [68]. Since measures enforced during the first lockdown in the two countries were

411

similar (e.g., all schools were closed, all non-essential work was done from home etc.) we reduced the age-specific

412

contact rates for Portugal after the lockdown by the same percentage as it was observed in the Netherlands (Figure

413

9 b). The resulting number of daily contacts for a person in given age group at baseline and after the lockdown

414

in April 2020 is shown in Figure 9 c. Like for the Netherlands [68], we observe larger reductions in contacts for

415

children (due to school closure) and smaller reductions for elderly because most of their contacts were essential

416

(e.g., with healthcare personnel or caretakers) and thus were not affected by the lockdown. The parameter ζ that

417

multiplies the inferred matrix akl can account for discrepancies between the real and inferred matrix.

418

To describe the contact rates after transitions 1)-4) have taken place, we assume that these can be written as a

419

liner combination ui bkl + (1 − ui )ζakl , i = 1, . . . , 4, where ui is the proportion of time a person behaves as before

420

the pandemic and (1 − ui ) is, respectively, the proportion of time a person behaves as during the first lockdown.

421

This contact structure can, therefore, interpolate between the first (most strict) lockdown and no measures in place

422

at all. Since the third lockdown was similar to the first lockdown, the transition 5) was modelled as a return to

424

the lockdown contact matrix ζbkl . As before, the transitions between the contact rates during periods 1)-5) are

modelled using logistic functions fi (t) = 1/ 1 + e−Ki (t−ti ) , where i = 1, . . . , 5. The general contact rate can

425

therefore be written as

423

426

ckl (t) = [1 − f0 (t)]bkl + f0 (t)ζakl [1 − f1 (t)] + f1 (t)[u1 bkl + (1 − u1 )ζakl ][1 − f2 (t)]

427

+ f2 (t)[u2 bkl + (1 − u2 )ζakl ][1 − f3 (t)] + f3 (t)[u3 bkl + (1 − u3 )ζakl ][1 − f4 (t)]

428

+ f4 (t)[u4 bkl + (1 − u4 )ζakl ][1 − f5 (t)] + f5 (t)ζakl .

(8)

429

All the parameters that describe ckl (t), except for the last transition 5) for which hospitalization data are not

430

available, are estimated (Table S4). The estimates for these 15 parameters ζ, ui (i = 1, . . . , 4), ti (i = 0, . . . , 4) and

431

Ki (i = 0, . . . , 4) are shown in Figure S2. The estimated logistic functions are plotted in Figure 9 d.

432

In the main analyses (Figures 6 and 7), the contact rates for vaccinated persons were equal to those unvaccinated,

433

cVkl (t) = ckl (t). In the sensitivity analyses (Figure S7), they were set to pre-pandemic contacts as follows, cVkl (t) = bkl .

434

435

The contact rate presented in Figures 3, 6 and 7 was the average contact rate in the population calculated as
n P
n
n

P
follows hc(t)i =
ckl (t)Nk /
Nk . Note that this expression makes use of the fact that in the main analyses
k=1 l=1

k=1

436

cVkl (t) = ckl (t).

437

The relaxation scenarios during the vaccination rollout are modelled as a transition from the contact rate described

438

by Eq. (8) to the contact rate bkl (Scenario 1); u2 bkl + (1 − u2 )ζakl (Scenario 2); u1 bkl + (1 − u1 )ζakl (Scenario 3);

439

u1 bkl + (1 − u1 )ζakl (Scenario 4, Step 1); u2 bkl + (1 − u2 )ζakl (Scenario 4, Step 2); bkl (Scenario 4, Step 3). The

parameters of the logistic functions describing these transitions are specified in Table S4.

441

Time-varying effective reproduction number

442

The basic reproduction number, R0 , is the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious

443

individual at the beginning of the epidemic in a disease-free, totally susceptible population. If R0 > 1 the disease

444

will spread exponentially. If R0 < 1 the number of infectious persons declines exponentially and the disease is not

445

able to spread. In general, R0 depends on the type of virus but also on the contact patterns in the population.

446

When the disease has already spread and we have no longer a fully susceptible population but some part of the

447

population is immune due to natural infection or vaccination, the generalization of R0 is given by the effective

448

reproduction number, Re (t). Re (t) depends on the type of virus, the level of population immunity and the contact

449

patterns in the population. The full control of the disease is achieved when Re (t) < 1 and the contact rates in

450

the population are at their pre-pandemic levels, i.e., not anymore affected by control measures. A partial control

451

is achieved when Re (t) < 1 but the contact rates have not been restored to their pre-pandemic levels yet as is

452

currently the case for SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal.

453

In a deterministic compartmental model such as the one employed here, the calculation of R0 and Re (t) can be

454

performed using the next-generation matrix (NGM) method [71]. The starting point of the method is to calculate

455

the Jacobian J of the equations for the latent (Ek , EkV ) and infectious (Ik , IkV ) age classes k, k = 1, . . . , n, isolated

456

from the full model given by Eqs. (1) and (2). The Jacobian J is then evaluated at the disease-free equilibrium of

457

interest.

458

For R0 calculation, the disease-free equilibrium is
Sk ∗ = Nk ,

459

460

∗

∗

∗

SkV = Ek ∗ = EkV = Ik ∗ = IkV = 0,

k = 1, . . . , n.

For Re (t) calculation with or without vaccination, the disease-free equilibrium is
Sk ∗ = Sk (t),

461

SkV = SkV (t),

Ek ∗ = EkV = Ik ∗ = IkV = 0,

(10)

462

where the time-dependent variables Sk (t) and SkV (t) are obtained from the solutions of the full model given by Eqs.

463

(1) and (2).

464

Following [71], the Jacobian J may be recast as follows

465

J = T + Σ,

466

where the transmissions matrix T contains the terms associated with the production of new infections, and the

467

transitions matrix Σ contains the terms associated with all other state changes. After performing this operation,

468

we construct a new matrix KL , called the large domain NGM [71], given by

469

KL = −TΣ−1 .

470

The basic reproduction number R0 at time t = 0 and the effective reproduction number Re (t) at any time t are given

471

by the spectral radius of KL which is the largest eigenvalue of KL . For the purpose of computing the spectral radius,

472

KL can be further reduced as detailed in [71]. The explicit expressions for matrices J, T, Σ and KL are given in the

473

Mathematica notebooks available in the GitHub repository, https://github.com/lynxgav/COVID19-vaccination.

474

Population immunity

475

The unprotected population was computed as the number of individuals in the fully susceptible compartment S

476

(Figure 8). The population protected by natural infection was computed as all individuals arriving into the infectious

477

compartment I, independently of whether these individuals will or will not be vaccinated later on. Recall, that in the

478

model vaccine has no effect in individuals who are recovered from natural infection and, therefore, the population

479

protected by vaccination grows slower than vaccination coverage. The population protected by vaccination was

480

computed as all individuals arriving into the compartments S V and I V due to vaccination.

481

Vaccine efficacies

482

Vaccine efficacies in reducing susceptibility (V ES ), infectivity (V EI ) and hospitalization rate (V EH ) were set using

483

initial data from clinical trials and real-word studies for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine [15,18–22]. Important to note,

484

that the efficacies reported in all these studies are not conditioned on infection while they are in the models like

485

ours. For a more complete discussion on this topic, we refer the reader to the pedagogical work by Lipsitch and

486

Kahn [23] and the report for England by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies [26].

487

The vaccine efficacy in reducing susceptibility (V ES ) was set based on vaccine efficacies and effectiveness against

488

infection (V Einfection ) reported in clinical trials and real-word studies, i.e.

(12)

489

V Einfection ≡ V ES .

490

The vaccine efficacy in reducing infectivity (V EI ) was assumed to be the same as vaccine efficacy in reducing disease

491

conditioned on infection (V Edisease|infection ), i.e. V Edisease|infection ≡ V EI . V Edisease|infection was calculated using

492

the efficacy against disease (V Edisease ) reported in clinical trials as follows

(13)

493

V Edisease = V Einfection + (1 − V Einfection )V Edisease|infection .

494

The vaccine efficacy in reducing hospitalization rate (V EH ) is equal to vaccine efficacy against severe disease con23

ditioned on disease (V Esevere disease|disease ), i.e. V Esevere disease|disease ≡ V EH . V Esevere disease|disease was calculated

496

using the vaccine efficacy against severe disease (V Esevere disease ) reported in trials as follows

V Esevere disease

497

= V Einfection + (1 − V Einfection )V Edisease|infection
+ (1 − V Einfection )(1 − V Edisease|infection )V Esevere disease|disease .

498

(15)

499

We used an optimistic and a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies for V ES , V EI and V EH (Table S2) based on

500

the range of values for V Einfection , V Edisease , and V Esevere disease reported in the literature [15, 18–22]. For the

501

optimistic set explored in the main analyses (Figures 6 and 7), we used V Einfection = 94%, V Edisease = 94%, and

502

V Esevere disease = 98% (corresponding to V ES = 94%, V EI = 0%, and V EH = 67%) [15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26]. For

503

the pessimistic set explored in sensitivity analyses (Figure S7), we used V Einfection = 55%, V Edisease = 55%, and

504

V Esevere disease = 55% (corresponding to V ES = 55%, V EI = 0%, and V EH = 0%) [19, 20, 26]. Other efficacies

505

reported in the literature for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and other existing vaccines fall in between the optimistic

506

and pessimistic values we used. This broad range of values is also relevant in case the market share of different

507

vaccine brands in Portugal gets changed throughout 2021.

Figure S7. Impact of vaccine efficacies and contact rates of vaccinated individuals. Scenario 4 (Figure
7 in the main text) but with a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies (Table S2). In addition to using a pessimistic set
of vaccine efficacies, we allow for behavior compensation post-vaccination modelled as a return to pre-pandemic
contact rates among vaccinated persons as compared to unvaccinated persons who may continue to have reduced
contact rates due to control measures. The hospitalization data are shown as red dots. The solid lines are the
median trajectories estimated from the model. The gray shaded regions correspond to 95% credible intervals. The
blue vertical lines indicate the mid-points of relaxation steps (1 April, 1 June, 1 October 2021). The gray vertical
lines indicate the starting dates for different vaccination phases (Table 1).

Description
Flat prior
Vague prior allowing for 1 to 5000 infected individuals on day t = 0
Vague priora
99% of the prior density of α−1 is between 2 and 5 days
95% of the prior density of γ −1 is between 5.3 and 8.2 days
Vague prior, where k denotes [0, 5), [5, 10), [10, 20), [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50), [50, 60), [60, 70), [70, 80), 80+
Odds-ratiob 2.23 based on prior estimates [52]
Odds-ratiob 0.64 based on prior estimates [52]
A priori, ζ should be close to 1
Flat prior (i = 1, . . . , 4)
With Ki = 1, the uptake of control measures takes approximately 6 days (i = 0, . . . , 4)
First lockdown around 18 March 2020 (State of Emergency)
Start of relaxation of lockdown around 4 May 2020 2020c
Further relaxation on 15 September 2020 (school opening)
Second lockdown 05 November 2020 (State of Emergency)
Relaxation of second lockdown on 25 December 2020

Notes: a The scale parameters of the normal distributions are equal to the standard deviation. b The age class 60+ is taken as a
reference for the relative susceptibility, i.e., β60+ ≡ 1. c The prior on the time of relaxation of the first lockdown is put on the time
where the logistic function equals 5%. Notice that logit(0.05) = −2.94.
