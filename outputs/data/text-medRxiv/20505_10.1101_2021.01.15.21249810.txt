Abstract
Multiple studies have demonstrated the negative impact of cancer care delays during the
COVID-19 pandemic, and transmission mitigation techniques are imperative for continued
cancer care delivery. To gauge the effectiveness of these measures at the University of
Pennsylvania, we conducted a longitudinal study of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity and
seroconversion in patients presenting to infusion centers for cancer-directed therapy between
5/21/2020 and 10/8/2020. Participants completed questionnaires and had up to five serial blood
collections. Of 124 enrolled patients, only two (1.6%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on
initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative patients developed newly detectable antibodies
on subsequent blood draw(s), corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 0% (95%CI 0.0-4.1%)
over 14.8 person-years of follow up, with a median of 13 healthcare visits per patient. These
results suggest that cancer patients receiving in-person care at a facility with aggressive
mitigation efforts have an extremely low likelihood of COVID-19 infection.

Introduction
Patients with cancer are at risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19[1-9]. In order to
reduce person-to-person contact, a wide array of cancer care procedures have been altered or
delayed during the pandemic[10, 11]. However, these disruptions are projected to lead to almost
10,000 excess deaths over the next decade from breast and colorectal cancer alone[12, 13] – a
grim second public health crisis arising as a consequence of the pandemic. Patients with cancer
face difficult decisions between continuing cancer-directed care and avoiding healthcare
settings to decrease infection risk.
The clear need to continue delivering cancer care while minimizing risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection has highlighted the importance of transmission mitigation techniques in both healthcare
and community settings. At outpatient oncology clinics at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn),
efforts to reduce in-person patient volume, including virtual visits, at-home infusions, and
decreased infusion frequencies, began in mid-March, 2020. For oncology patients who
continued to receive in-person care, safety measures included text message questionnaires
regarding contact with COVID-positive individuals, temperature screenings, contactless check-in
procedures, visitor limitations, and physically separated COVID-19+ clinic spaces.
Methods
In order to gauge the effectiveness of these measures, we conducted a prospective
longitudinal study to assess the rate of SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity and seroconversion
in patients undergoing active cancer therapy. Patients with solid malignancies presenting to the
Penn Abramson Cancer Center for chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy were enrolled
between 5/21/2020 and 10/8/2020. Patients were approached via phone and provided
electronic consent for blood collection, electronic surveys, and access to electronic health
records (EHR). We targeted patients receiving therapy on a single day of the week to capture a
mixture of solid malignancy types and facilitate longitudinal follow-up.

In order to assess seropositivity and seroconversion, up to five serial blood draws were
performed during treatment visits at a minimum of three weeks apart. At each encounter, 50mL
of blood was drawn and centrifuged for 15 minutes; serum, plasma and buffy coat were stored
at -80C. Samples were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies to the spike receptor
binding domain antigen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approach, with
high sensitivity and specificity[14]. Patients received electronic questionnaires at each of their
blood draw dates which assessed self-reported measures of health, SARS-COV-2 exposure,
and social interactions. Patients were not informed of antibody test results. This study was
approved by the institutional review board at Penn.
Results
Of 440 eligible patients approached, 124 (28%) consented and had antibody testing. The
remainder either could not be reached (n=89, 28%) or declined participation (n=227, 72%). Most
enrolled patients had metastatic cancer, with a median of two prior lines of systemic therapy;
approximately half had ECOG performance status>0; and over a third were leukopenic over the
course of the study (Table 1). Patients had a median of 13 (IQR 9-18) in-person healthcare
visits and seven (IQR 5-10) cycles of cancer therapy from March to final study blood draw,
based on EHR review. Of patients who completed the initial questionnaire, 110/121 (94%)
reported being highly compliant (4-5 on Likert scale) with CDC-recommended social distancing
measures, and 81/118 (69%) reported a low level of social interactions (going out ≤3 times a
week) (Supplemental Table 1). Seventy-eight patients completed ≥1 subsequent survey; the
majority maintained low level of social interactions (57%) or decreased their interactions to ≤3
times per week (19%) (Supplemental Table 2). Most patients reported no exposures to
individuals known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection on initial (n=102, 85%) and
subsequent surveys (n=66, 85%).
Of 124 patients enrolled, 90 had at least one subsequent blood draw, a median of 28
days apart, comprising 14.9 person-years of follow up (Figure 1). Only two (1.6%) participants

had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 on their first blood draw. Both of these patients were
female, white, and receiving chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. One patient with breast
cancer had symptomatic COVID-19 in April and had only detectable IgG on her two on-study
blood draws (8/27 and 9/24). The other patient, with esophageal cancer, had only detectable
IgM on her two blood draws (8/20 and 9/17) and never developed symptomatic COVID-19. Of
88 seronegative patients with at least one subsequent blood draw, none developed detectable
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 on any subsequent blood draw, corresponding to a seroconversion
rate of 0% (95% CI 0-4.1%) over 14.8 person-years of follow up.
Discussion and Conclusion
In this single-center prospective study, we found a low rate of seropositivity and no
seroconversions in patients interacting frequently with the healthcare system in-person to
receive active cancer-directed therapy. Other reports of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in cancer
patients have ranged from 3.6%[15] to 31.4%[16]. These reports dated from periods and
locations when population estimates were higher than that in Philadelphia during the study
period; the non-cancer US population had an estimated seroprevalence <10% in the majority of
jurisdictions studied from August-September 2020[17]. However, a study of parturient women
giving birth at two Philadelphia hospitals from April-June 2020 reported a higher 6.2%
seroprevalence rate[14].
Serologic assays are imperfect measures of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection due to
variable test sensitivity, timing, and antibody persistence[18, 19]. In particular, patients with less
severe illness, as well as cancer patients on cytotoxic or immunomodulatory therapy, may have
lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and detection rates[20, 21]. Moreover, seroprevalence rates
are a product of multiple demographic, geographic, temporal, and behavioral factors, and thus it
is not possible to determine the precise causal relationship between health system mitigation
strategies and seroconversion without a randomized trial. Questionnaire responses showed that
our patients were generally highly adherent to COVID-19 prevention strategies, potentially due

to a personal sense of vulnerability. However, the low rate of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and
seroconversion seen in our cohort likely also reflects the success of transmission mitigation
measures within healthcare facilities, and suggests that these efforts, when combined with
social distancing outside the healthcare setting, may help protect vulnerable cancer patients
from SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection, even when ongoing immunomodulatory cancer
treatments and frequent healthcare exposure are necessary. Continued reinforcement of
practices including physical distancing, masking, and visitor limitation will remain critical as
pandemic fatigue rises along with COVID-19 cases.
