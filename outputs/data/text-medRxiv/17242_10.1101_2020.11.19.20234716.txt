Abstract
Based on publicly available data supplied by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO), we calculated
life tables by sex and by week for seven major regions of Switzerland in 2020, up to October 26th.
These life tables provide information on the trends of life expectancy at birth and at the age of 65
years during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.

The results show

a

strong cyclical decrease in life

expectancy, particularly in Ticino, where

this

variable has decreased by almost 6 years compared to the 2019 life expectancy, and in the Lake
Geneva region. The other regions of Switzerland observed more modest decreases during the first
wave, generally not exceeding a 2-year reduction. This decrease can be explained to some extent by
seasonal variations in this indicator.

In conclusion, the very sharp decrease in the average lifespan observed in the two regions mentioned
above

suggests that the

first wave of the

epidemic had a

significant impact. It also reflects an

unfavourable health situation. The life expectancy at the age of 65 years observed at the end of
March 2020 in Ticino corresponded to the average life expectancy observed in Switzerland forty
years ago.

The calculated indicators have the advantage of accounting for the age structures of the respective
populations. They therefore demonstrate their usefulness in monitoring during a pandemic, such as
the one occurring currently.

Introduction
The first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in March and April 2020 caused significant
excess mortality in almost all European countries. In Switzerland, this excess mortality has been

1

documented by raw data from the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) ; the data indicate a higher number
of deaths in those aged 65 and over than the average number of deaths in the same population in
previous years. In contrast, before the age of 65, the mortality rate remained more or less the same.
This excess mortality was short-lived, lasting from Mid-March to April.

The

increase

in

the

number

of

deaths,

compared

to

previous

years,

is

not

an

uncommon

phenomenon. It has been documented during various influenza episodes. However, this increase in
the level of mortality is difficult to comment on without a more accurate and age-adjusted measure
of mortality.

For this reason, the establishment of life tables and the calculation of life expectancies can provide
an

indication

of

the

precise

impact

of

an

epidemic

on

the

population

as

a

whole.

Indeed,

life

expectancies are standardized indicators that reflect the rate of mortality in a given period after
taking into account the age structure of the population and the distributions of deaths by age. They
also allow spatial comparisons of health situations. In our case, they can indicate the net impact of a
public health issue on the life span of a population.

In this paper, we calculate life expectancies in seven major regions of Switzerland and describe the
short-term consequences of the first wave of COVID-19 on life expectancy.

Methods
Life tables were calculated from data on the number of deaths published by the FSO for the different
regions of Switzerland. We stratified the number of deaths (all-cause death) by five-year age groups,
region of Switzerland, sex and week for the first 45 weeks of 2020. The populations by sex and age as
of December 31, 2019, were used as the basis for the calculation of mortality rates in each age group,
which

were

transformed

into

quotients

according

to

the

Berkson

formula.

In

order

to

have

a

reference value, we also computed the weekly and annual life tables for the year 2019.

To do so, we assumed a uniform distribution of deaths over the considered age groups and a life
expectancy of 2.5 years in the last open age group. Since the 2020 population by age and sex in the
target regions of Switzerland is unknown, the rates were therefore calculated by dividing deaths by
the population at the end of December 2019. However, the populations in the different regions are
likely

to

change

due

to

births,

deaths,

and

migration

flow.

Given

the

short

period

under

consideration, changes in populations should not significantly influence the results.

Based on these data, we calculated weekly life expectancies at different ages in seven major regions
of Switzerland and by sex. Due to the low number of weekly deaths in the smaller regions, statistical
fluctuations may be present. For this reason, we smoothed the weekly values by applying a moving
average,

which

was

calculated

by

considering

the

average

value

of

three

weeks.

Only

life

expectancies at birth and at age 65 are presented here.

Results
Table 1 shows the minimum life expectancy during the first wave (March 23 to April 16) compared
with the 2019 annual average. According to this table, two regions were significantly affected by this
first wave. First, considering the average over the whole period, life expectancy at birth in Ticino
decreased by 6 years in men and women; it was during the week of March 23 for men and March 30
for women that Ticino life expectancies were the lowest, at 76.8 years in men and 79.7 years in
women. At the age of 65, male life expectancy was less than 14 years (female 16 years), which is
more than 6 years less than the reference period (2019).

Computations are based on FSO data.
The Arc lémanique, for the most part, observed a reduction of more than 3.5 years in male life
expectancy (at birth and at the age of 65) and nearly 2 years in female life expectancy. The lowest
levels of life expectancy were observed in the week beginning on March 23 in men and on March 30
in women.

The other regions of Switzerland experienced shorter life expectancies during the first wave than the
annual averages. The reduction in life expectancy at birth was approximately 2 years in men and
between 0.8 years and 1.9 years in women. Similar values were observed for life expectancy at age
65. These decreases in life expectancy indicate a small impact of mortality associated with the first
wave; however, the decrease is hardly more than that associated with normal seasonal variations.

Annex 1 provides the trends in the life expectancy at birth and at age 65 for every region and for
both

sexes.

The

data

refers

to

the

period

until

week

45

(2-8

November).

Undoubtedly,

life

expectancies in some regions that were spared during the first wave are declining rapidly since the
end of October.

Conclusion
In times of health crises, it is important to have reliable data to monitor the precise health situation.
The availability of mortality data is one of the elements of COVID-19 monitoring. These data have
highlighted excess mortality during successive waves compared to the number of expected deaths on
the basis of recent years in many countries and regions.

The calculation of life expectancies provides precise information, as this indicator controls for the age
structures of populations. It allows comparisons on a standardized basis. It measures the impact of a
health crisis in terms of the length of remaining life for the entire population (life expectancy at birth)

or for elderly individuals (life expectancy at age 65) given a specific health-based context. The results
obtained show the different impacts of the first wave in each region. They showed a very sharp drop
in life expectancy, indicating significant health impairment that was not limited to elderly individuals.

The situation in Ticino at the end of March is particularly remarkable. Men aged 65 and over had a
level of mortality equivalent to a life expectancy of 14 years (16 years for women). Such values were
last exceeded for all of Switzerland in 1980. In other words, the health situation in Ticino during the
first wave was comparable to that observed 40 years ago.

Until now, two papers measured the impact of Covid19 on life expectancy. Gishlandi et al., 2020
showed a significant decrease in life expectancy in five provinces of Northern Italy and found that for
the first wave of the epidemic, life expectancy at birth reduced by 5.1 to 7.8 for men and 3.2 to 5.8
years

for

women.

Our

results

from

Ticino

are

therefore

neighbouring Lombardy. Trias-Llimos et al., 2020 for Spain

comparable
showed that

to
the

those

observed

in

drop in weekly life

expectancy reached 7.6 years and at the national level and 15 years in Madrid.

Calculations

may

soon

be

performed

for

the

second

wave,

which

occurred

beyond

the

period

covered by the currently available data. The approach will thus make it possible to compare the
respective impacts of the two waves using a single indicator.
