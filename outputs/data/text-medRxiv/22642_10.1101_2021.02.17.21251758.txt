KEY POINTS
Question: Can we predict the likelihood of hospital discharge as well as mortality from data
obtained in the first 48 hours from admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients?
Findings: Models based on extensive phenotyping mined directly from electronic medical
records followed by variable selection, accounted for the competing events of hospital death
versus discharge, predicted both death and discharge with area under the receiver operating
characteristic curves of >0·80.
Meaning: Hospital discharge and mortality can be forecasted with high accuracy based on just
8-10 variables, and the probability of hospital discharge increased over the course of the
pandemic.

BSTRACT

A predictive model to automatically identify the earliest determinants of both hospital
discharge and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be of great assistance to caregivers if
the predictive information is generated and made available in the immediate hours following admission.
Importance:

: To identify the most important predictors of hospital discharge and mortality from
measurements at admission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Objective

: Observational cohort study.

Design

Setting

: Electronic records from hospitalized patients.

: Patients admitted between March 3rd and August 24th with COVID-19 in Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals.

Participants

Exposures

: 216 phenotypic variables collected within 48 hours of admission.

: We used age-stratified (<60 and >=60 years) random survival forests with competing
risks to identify the most important predictors of death and discharge. Fine-Gray competing risk
regression (FGR) models were then constructed based on the most important RSF-derived covariates.
Main Outcomes

: Of 2212 patients, 1913 were discharged (age 57±19, time-to-discharge 9±11 days) while 279
died (age 75±14, time to death 14±15 days). Patients >= 60 years were nearly 10 times as likely to die
within 60 days of admission as those <60. As the pandemic evolved, the rate of hospital discharge
increased in both older and younger patients. Incident death and hospital discharge were accurately
predicted by measures of respiratory distress, inflammation, infection, renal function, red cell turn over
and cardiac stress. FGR models for each of hospital discharge and mortality as outcomes based on these
variables performed well in the older (AUC 0·80-0·85 at 60-days) and younger populations (AUC >0·90 at
60-days).
Results

: We identified markers collected within 2 days of admission that predict
hospital discharge and mortality in COVID-19 patients and provide prediction models that may be used
to guide patient care. Our proposed model suggests that hospital discharge and mortality can be
forecasted with high accuracy based on 8-10 variables at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
findings also point to several specific pathways that could be the focus of future investigations directed
at reducing mortality and expediting hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients. Probability of hospital
discharge increased over the course of the pandemic.

NTRODUCTION
The clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic carriers who
can transmit the virus to a mild clinical upper respiratory infection that can progress to acute respiratory
distress syndrome with a high fatality rate.1,2 In addition to the upper respiratory disease presentation,
direct inflammatory damage and microvascular thrombosis induced by COVID-19 can affect the tissue
and vasculature of multiple organs in addition to the lungs, leading to severe life-threatening disease in
a large number of affected individuals.3,4 Among those hospitalized, approximately 10-15% become
critically ill requiring ICU monitoring and/or mechanical ventilation, and many succumb to multi-organ
failure.2,5 Therefore, it is crucial that physicians be able to identify the predictors of vital organ failure
and death.
I

However, from the perspective of patients being hospitalized for COVID-19 at the present time, the
most important consideration is their likelihood of eventual discharge from the hospital. From this
perspective, identifying predictions of hospital discharge to guide optimization of medical care is among
the most crucial pieces of needed information. While they reflect the physicians’ imperative to
efficiently recognize and stratify patient risk, predictors of hospital discharge and incident mortality may
provide important complementary information, particularly if the predictive information is generated
and made available in the immediate hours following admission, during the time window that largely
defines COVID-19 disease outcomes.
We examined such a clinical predictive model constructed from data collected from all COVID-19
patients within 48 hours of admission to the five hospitals of one large health care system in the state of
Maryland. We utilized a combination of machine learning guided variable selection coupled with
established analytic methods to select the most important clinical markers and pathways that predict
both time to discharge and incident mortality.

PATIENT POPULATION
The entire dataset was extracted from the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) electronic medical
record system, EPIC. JHHS has a diverse referral base, including the city of Baltimore as well as
surrounding suburban areas adjacent to Washington DC in Maryland and neighboring states. The
institutional review boards of all five affiliated hospitals approved this study and waived requirements
for individual informed consent. All patients consecutively admitted with confirmed COVID-19 between
March 3 and August 24, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using RT-PCR assays with the
vast majority of samples were collected via nasopharyngeal swabs. Time to hospital discharge or death
were considered as competing primary outcomes for the study.
Measurements collected included demographics, social history, comorbidities, and ancillary studies.
Clinical parameters encompassed vital signs, encounter diagnosis and clinical problems listed at
presentation. All measurements entered in the analysis were collected within 48 hours of admission and
only those available in at least 50% of the patient population were included. Overall, 216 features
obtained from diverse domains were utilized in the analysis. Figure S1 (supplementary Figure 1) shows

the number of missing variables per patient of the variables that were included in the analysis. The
supplement includes more details on the measurements.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The distributions of variables were evaluated to determine population data structure and assess
skewness. Logarithmic transformations were used for variables with skewed distributions. For time-toevent analyses, the origin (t0) was the time of admission. Missing values were assumed to be missing at
random, and random forest imputation was used as previously described.6
We used random survival forests (RSF) with competing risks,7 including death and hospital discharge as
competing events for efficient variable selection and identification of the most important parameters
associated with time to the two events of interest. The splitting rule was based on Gray’s test for
improved prediction of cumulative event incidence.8 The most important event-specific predictors were
identified using variable importance from permutation (VIMP).9 A backward stepwise competing risk
Fine-Gray regression model with minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion starting from the
top-20 RSF predictors was generated for each endpoint to estimate the cumulative incidence function
(CIF) for each event of interest. The time-dependent area under the receiver-operator curves based on
each parsimonious Fine-Gray model were then calculated.7,10–13 Further details on model development,
validation and statistical methods are provided in the Supplement.
ESULTS
Between March 3rd and August 24th 2020, 2212 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19
at one of the five JHHS-affiliated hospitals. Of these, 1913 were discharged while 279 died while in the
hospital. The mean (SD) time to discharge was 9±11 days while the mean time to death during
hospitalization was 14±15 days.
R

Age showed significant non-linearity (Figure S3), where in participants over 60 years, greater age was
linearly associated with greater chance of death and lower chance of discharge. In those below 60 years,
age was associated with both outcomes with much lower slopes. Given this observation, the significant
interactions between age and most covariates as well as comorbidities, the analyses were performed
separately in participants below and at-or-above 60 years of age. Table 1 provides patient characteristics
for the entire population stratified by those older and younger than 60 years of age, and Figure 1 shows
the overall CIF for hospital death and discharge over time as calculated from the RSF analysis.

EVOLUTION OF PROGNOSIS FOR PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED OVER THE TIME COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC
To account for the evolving nature of medical therapy and prognosis over the time course of the
pandemic, we included the time from the start of the pandemic in the state of Maryland (time of first
admission to the JHHS system - March 3rd), relative to each patient’s date of admission as a covariate.
Figure 2 shows the partial effect of time since the local pandemic start to the CIF calculated at 60 days,
taking into account the effect of all covariates in the RSF predictive model. The figure shows the
progressive decrease of the CIF for death, with corresponding CIF increase for hospital discharge at 60
days after admission, as the pandemic evolved. The magnitude of changes in the CIFs for mortality were

of the order of 20-25% in both the older and younger patients. Consequently, all models included this as
a covariate.

VARIABLE IMPORTANCE CALCULATED FROM RSF
The most important predictors of hospital discharge and death are shown in Table S1 in descending
order of importance. Thirty among the 279 patients who died while hospitalized were younger than 60
years. As a consequence, predictive power for death among patients younger than 60 years was limited,
and the corresponding results should be interpreted with caution.
Figure S4 displays the relative importance for all variables across different domains pertaining to
hospital discharge and mortality for patients 60 years and older (top) as well as to hospital discharge
among those younger than 60 years of age (bottom). When compared to breathing room air, the
magnitude of oxygen requirement in the first 48 hours from admission expressed as flow rate, device
complexity and invasiveness, progressively reduced the likelihood and increased the time to hospital
discharge among older and younger patients, and predicted death among those aged 60 and older.
Lower respiratory and heart rates, lower BUN and procalcitonin levels, lesser inflammation as indexed
by lower CRP levels, lower eosinophil count as well as reduced red cell distribution width (RDW) were
associated with greater likelihood and shortened time to hospital discharge in both the 60 and older and
younger than 60 years of age groups. The same were associated with opposite effects for incident death
among those 60 and older. Other measures featured prominently on the specific lists of most important
predictors for the two outcomes in both age groups are shown in Table S1 and Figure S4. Supplemental
figures S5-S8 show partial effect plots from the RSF model used to examine non-linear associations and
directionality.

FINAL PREDICTION MODELS FOR HOSPITAL DISCHARGE AND MORTALITY
Fine-Gray models were validated (Figure S9) and the performance of the parsimonious Fine-Gray models
was similar to that of the RSF models with all variables (Figure S10) for each outcome of interest. The
corresponding final model sub-distribution hazard ratios and p-values are shown in Table 2 for the older
and younger age groups respectively.
Among hospitalized patients older than 60 years of age, hospital discharge could be predicted with an
area under the curve of 0·84 (CI:0·81 - 0·87) at 60 days (Figure 3) by a combination of 10 variables: 1)
lower respiratory rate, 2) lower CRP, 3) younger age, 4) lower heart rate, 5) longer time since the start of
the pandemic, 6) absence of sepsis, 7) lower BUN, 8) less altered RDW, 9) higher eosinophil count and
10) type of oxygen device used in the first 48 hours following hospital admission. Similar variables
predicted mortality among hospitalized patients aged 60 years of age and older with an AUC of 0·80 (CI:
0·77-0·83). They included: 1) higher respiratory rate, 2) greater RDW, 3) greater age, 4) shorter time
since the pandemic started, 5) higher heart rate, 6) greater mean corpuscular volume, 7) higher Creactive protein, and 8) lower systolic blood pressure in the first 48 hours from admission.
Similarly, hospital discharge among COVID-19 patients younger than 60 could be predicted with AUC of
0·92 (CI:0·87 - 0·96) at 60 days by a combination of 10 slightly different variables: 1) younger age, 2)
greater time since the start of the pandemic, 3) lower respiratory rate, 4) lower creatinine, 5) lower

procalcitonin; 6) lower NTproBNP levels, 7) reduced RDW, 8) lower heart rate; 9) lower ferritin and 10)
type of oxygen device used within the first 48 hours of hospital admission. Notwithstanding the
limitations mentioned above, the predictors for death selected by the final model for patients younger
than 60 years of age included: 1) greater AST/ALT ratio, 2) higher BUN, 3) higher procalcitonin levels,
and 4) greater heart rate.
Finally, because oxygen device prescribed in the first 48 hours from admission could be considered both
as a predictor and a treatment modality, we constructed models for likelihood and time to discharge
excluding type of oxygen device. Predictive power was reduced by 3-4% on average for each model as
shown in Figure 3.
ISCUSSION
The results of this study suggest that statistical learning methods can be used for meaningful variable
selection from routine, clinically acquired medical data. Based on such selection, parsimonious models
were derived to risk stratify hospitalized COVID-19 patients and accurately predict the likelihood and
time to hospital discharge and death. Respiratory dysfunction phenotypes combined with selected
parameters reflecting systemic inflammation, organ/tissue damage, metabolic dysregulation, red cell
turnover and coagulation abnormalities predicted hospital discharge and death with AUC = 0·84 (CI:0·81
- 0·87) and AUC = 0·80 (CI: 0·77 - 0·83) respectively for patients older than 60 years, as well as hospital
discharge with AUC = 0·92 (CI: 0·87 - 0·96) for those younger than 60 years of age. Our findings also
suggest that as the pandemic evolved, the adjusted death rates dropped, while the probability and rates
of hospital discharge improved for both older and younger COVID-19 patients.
D

Pulmonary inflammatory and respiratory involvement captured by the respiratory rate and the type of
device prescribed to deliver oxygen in the first 48 hours after admission were the two most important
predictors of hospital discharge for both older and younger than 60 years COVID-19 patients. Greater
respiratory rate also predicted mortality among older and younger COVID-19 patients.14 Greater
eosinophil count predicted hospital discharge while lower eosinophil count predicted death during
hospitalization among patients 60 and older. Immunologic response mediated in part by cytokine
release and resulting inflammation has been previously implicated in both disease severity and ability to
respond to the viremic insult.15 In this regard, CRP as a systemic inflammatory marker, was more useful
among patients 60 and older as a predictor of both hospital discharge and mortality than in patients
younger than age 60. Conversely, procalcitonin, a hormone reflecting a heightened immunologic state
was a more prominent predictor among the younger patients with COVID-19.16 Both CRP and procalcitonin have been consistently found to predict disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
Since COVID-19 emergence, signs and symptoms of sepsis associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection
have been reported as hallmarks of disease progression in critically ill patients, with septic shock
indicated as a major determinant of mortality in a large proportion of hospitalized patients.1 In our
study, sepsis was strongly associated with later and less likely hospital discharge in the older age group.
The striking relationship between fatality rate and age has been previously documented17,18 and our
analysis demonstrated a steep increase beginning at age 60, which defined our cutoff for age
stratification. While immunologic response is known to be age dependent, COVID-19 age dependence

appears to be also related to systemic vascular aging given its proclivity for endothelial damage. While
pulmonary involvement determines the need for hospitalization and the intensity of care required, preexisting and superimposed endothelial injury appears to underlie organ system disease severity,
including the pulmonary system. In our study, heart rate increase, unlike respiratory rate increase, more
likely reflects systemic demand as opposed to direct myocardial injury, although the latter cannot be
entirely ruled out in most patients. Similarly, hypotension in the first two days of admission portended a
greater risk of death in patients 60 or older, likely reflecting a combination of systemic and
cardiovascular pathology. Accurate rates of cardiac and vascular involvement among inpatient and
outpatient COVID-19 patients remain difficult to quantify at present.19–22
Renal function, as the ability to keep up with the increased byproduct load of upregulated catabolism
from infection, inflammation and damage is further impaired by direct kidney endothelial injury in
COVID-19. In our study, the predictive power of accumulated BUN was remarkable in the final model for
hospital discharge in patients 60 and older, as well as for death among patients younger than 60 years of
age. In addition, among the latter, lower creatinine was a major marker of hospital discharge, while
hepatic dysfunction was a predictor of mortality.23–25
Importantly also, red blood cell turnover measured as RDW was a marker of both hospital discharge and
mortality among patients 60 years and older, and also of hospital discharge among those younger than
60 years of age. Among older patients, red cell turnover as an index of systemic marrow stress was also
reflected by the association of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) to outcomes.26,27 These findings support
the concept of thrombotic microangiopathy as a potential pathogenetic process in COVID-19.28
The limitations of the predictive model for hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 have
been emphasized. In that group, 1061 patients were discharged and only 30 died while in the hospital.
Therefore, the model for mortality should be interpreted with caution. Another limitation of our study is
that data are derived from a statewide health system and their generalizability is therefore affected by
population demographic and other regional differences. Data on disease presentation and history of
medical conditions from the electronic health record may be incomplete. Similarly, post-discharge
outcomes were not included in this analysis and those occurring outside our health care system may
have been missed.
A strength of this study is the use of competing risk to assess outcomes after hospitalization for COVID19. As observed in other studies as well as in our study population, the time to discharge is relatively
short and the likelihood of discharge is high after hospitalization for COVID-19. Given this scenario,
considering patients who were discharged at a given time point as right-censored when in-hospital
death is the primary outcome, implicitly assumes that they have similar risk of dying from COVID-19,
compared to those who are still at risk (i.e. still in the hospital) at that time point. In such a situation,
assessment of competing risks provides a more accurate assessment of risks. The study of time to
discharge also adds to our understanding of prolonged hospital stay due to concomitant complications.
Finally, this study clearly shows the importance of cohort effect on the probability of hospital mortality
and mirrored elevation in the likelihood and time to hospital discharge. Determinants of such

differences cannot be quantified from this analysis. Hypothesized contributors include the
implementation of treatments documented as effective in COVID-19.29 Moreover, oxygen delivery
strategies such as proning and optimal timing for mechanical intubation changed as the pandemic
evolved. Other modifications in management strategies may not have been as obvious and remain
unaccounted.
In conclusion, we identified specific markers at admission that predict time to hospital discharge and
mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 and provide prediction models that may be used to guide
patient care.

Figure 1: Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) for death and discharge from the competing risk Random
Survival Forests models for the patients under 60 years of age and patients 60 and over. The curves for
death are represent 1-CIF. * - The number of deaths in the younger age group was n=30, appropriate
care should be taken when interpreting the results.

the start (x-axis) of the pandemic in Maryland (since March 3rd) with the cumulative incidence function
at 60 days post-admission (y-axis) for discharge (left column) and death (right column) as computed
from the competing risk Random Survival Forests model with all variables included in the >=60 year old
(top row) and <60 year old patients (bottom row). * - The number of deaths in the younger age group
was n=30, appropriate care should be taken when interpreting the results.

Table 2: Coefficients (and associated p-values) from Fine-Gray competing risk regression models for
prediction of (a) discharge (n=852) and death (n=249) after variable selection using RSF in patients 60
years of age and over; and (b) discharge (n=1061) and death (n=30) after variable selection using RSF in
patients under 60 years of age. * - The number of deaths in the young population was n=30, therefore
appropriate care should be taken when interpreting the results.
