Abstract

30

Background: Our understanding of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to

31

evolve. However, there are many unknowns about its epidemiology.

32

Purpose: To synthesize the number of deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases, incubation

33

period, as well as time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit, ICU admission,

34

recovery and death of COVID-19.

35

Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 through to

36

March 11, 2020 without language restrictions as well as bibliographies of relevant articles.

37

Study Selection: Quantitative studies that recruited people living with or died due to COVID-

38

19.

39

Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Conflicts were resolved

40

through discussion with a senior author.

41

Data Synthesis: Out of 1675 non-duplicate studies identified, 57 were included. Pooled mean

42

incubation period was 5.84 (99% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Pooled mean number of days from the

43

onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15), ICU admission

44

was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), recovery was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87), and until death

45

was 15.93 (95% CI: 13.07, 18.79). Pooled probability of COVID-19-related death was 0.02 (95%

46

CI: 0.02, 0.03).

47

Limitations: Studies are observational and findings are mainly based on studies that recruited

48

patient from clinics and hospitals and so may be biased toward more severe cases.

49

Conclusion:

50

We found that the incubation period and lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis

51

of COVID-19 is longer than other respiratory viral infections including MERS and SARS;

however, the current policy of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone might be too

conservative. Longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases.

Background

61

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in a

62

few unusual pneumonia patients linked to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market in China in

63

December 2019 (1). However, it soon grew out of China and the corona virus disease 2019

64

(COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and is now found in 190 countries

65

(2). While the epidemic seems to have slowed down in China due to the strict quarantine and

66

preventative regulations, the number of COVI-19 patients (i.e., >370,000 as of March 23rd)

67

and confirmed deaths (i.e., i.e., >16,000 as of March 23rd) are rapidly increasing (2); figures

68

that greatly surpass that of other diseases in the family of coronaviruses with similar genomes

69

to SARS-CoV-2 such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory

70

Syndrome (MERS) (3) which emerged in 2003, 8,098 patients and 774 deaths across 29

71

countries, and 2012, leading to 2494 patients and 858 deaths across 27 countries, respectively

72

(4-6). The healthcare systems in many countries, such as Italy, Iran, Spain, and France are

73

overwhelmed and struggling with the soaring number of patients (7).

74

Although our understanding of COVID-19’s epidemiology is evolving, it is assumed that SARS-

75

CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via droplets and close contacts with people carrying the virus (2).

76

However, recent reports have also proposed the possibility of the virus being contracted via

77

various surfaces, gastrointestinal transmission (8), and potentially airborne (2, 9). Based on

78

the existing evidence, elderly population, those with suppressed immune systems, and

79

underlying metabolic, cardiovascular or respiratory diseases are at an increased risk for

80

adverse outcomes; however, recent reports from outside China point to a considerable risk

81

of severe outcomes among the general adult population (i.e., <65 years old) (10, 11).

82

As we continue to learn more about COVID-19 and its characteristics, there are many

83

unknowns and confusions about its epidemiology such as hospitalization- and recovery-

84

related outcomes which are indeed of utmost importance when it comes to health system

85

preparedness (12, 13). For example, mean number of days of incubation for COVID-19 varies

86

greatly across the existing literature ranging from 2.5 (14) to 12.1 (15) days. Our knowledge

87

of time from contracting the disease to recovery or death are even more limited. In this

88

systematic review, we tried to identify the studies that recruited patients diagnosed with

89

COVID-19 and calculate polled estimates for several epidemiological and clinical outcomes to

90

help provide an overall picture of the characteristics of COVID-19. Findings of this study could

91

help inform the ongoing public health and public policy practices across the world.

Methods

103

The details of inclusion criteria and analytical approach were designed a priori and are

104

documented in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/a3k94/).

105
106

Databases and Search Strategy

107

Following the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (16) and the Peer

108

Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) guideline (17), we searched PubMed,

109

Embase, and Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 through to March 11, 2020 for studies

110

that measured and reported several characteristics of COVID-19 (e.g., incubation period,

111

hospitalization, death). Search terms were combined using appropriate Boolean operators

112

and included subject heading terms/keywords relevant to COVID-19 (e.g., novel coronavirus,

113

sars-cov2, coronavirus disease). Please see supplement 1 for a sample search strategy.

114
115

Inclusion criteria

116

Quantitative studies were included in the review if they reported incubation period or time

117

from onset of the symptoms to first medical visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, recovery

118

or death. Studies were also included if they reported number of deaths from patients with

119

confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Studies were not excluded based on language, location, or

120

measurement method. Given the nature of the study which used secondary data involving no

121

interaction with humans, no ethics approval was required.

122
123

Study Selection

124

Two authors (SJ and NN) completed the abstract and full-text screening, independently.

125

Citations that met our eligibility criteria or were unclear were screened at full-text by two

independent reviewers (SJ and NN) in duplicate. Disagreements over inclusion of studies were

127

resolved through discussion. Duplicate records were excluded.

128
129

Data Extraction

130

Data were extracted independently by the two authors (SJ and NN), and discrepancies were

131

resolved through discussion or by arbitration with a senior co-author (AM). Data were

132

extracted on study type (e.g., descriptive, case-series, mathematical modeling), publication

133

year, location, sample size, patients’ age, gender, exposure history, X-ray and computed

134

tomography (18) scan findings, symptoms, and underlying conditions if reported. We also

135

extracted data on the main outcomes of interests including the number of deaths from

136

confirmed COVID-19 cases, incubation period, as well as time from onset of COVID-19

137

symptoms to first medical visit, to ICU admission, to recovery and to death.

138
139

Statistical analysis

140

For studies that did not provided enough data to be included in the meta-analysis, we

141

performed a qualitative data synthesis. Case-reports with a sample size of one were also

142

removed from the meta-analysis as they did not provide any dispersion estimate. Meta-

143

analysis was performed using STATA’s (V.15.1) metan (for numerical variables) and metaprop

144

(for binary variables) commands. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary variables were

145

computed using the exact binomial method. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed

146

using both the I2 statistic with a cutoff of ≥ 50% and the Chi-square test with P-value <0.10 to

147

define a significant degree of heterogeneity (19). As all results turned to be significantly

148

heterogenous, we used random-effects model to calculate the pooled point estimate and 95%

149

CI for the mortality rate, mean time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first medical visit,

150

ICU admission, recovery and death. For mean incubation period, we estimated 99% CI. We

151

also conducted a random-effects meta-regression using STATA’s metareg command to

152

identify the sources of heterogeneity and explore the effect of study-level covariates where

153

data were available. A two-sided P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant

154

effect.

Results

157

Participants and study characteristics

158

We found a total of 1675 non-duplicate studies, 57 of which were included in our qualitative

159

synthesis and 43 were considered for meta-analysis (Figure 1). A description of the main

160

characteristics of the included studies is provided in Table 1. The 57 studies included 27 cross-

161

sectional, one case-control, one retrospective cohort, and 28 case series/case report studies

162

with sample sizes of observational studies ranging greatly from one to 58182 for a study in

163

the Hubei province (20). Inclusion criteria varied greatly across the studies but most

164

participants were hospitalized patients living or traveling from various provinces in China.

165

Median (range) age of the participants was 46.2 (17 days to 78.5 years) and about 60% were

166

men. Most studies were conducted between January and February 2020. Clinical and

167

epidemiological characteristics of the patients included in the study are presented in Table 2.

168

Among studies that reported exposure history among their participants, most patients were

169

directly or indirectly traced back to the city Wuhan (e.g., lived in Wuhan or had recently

170

travelled to Wuhan) and the Huanan seafood market in Hubei province, China. Several cases

171

of contracting COVID-19 through close contacts with family members were also reported

172

across the studies. Frequent CT or X-ray findings included thickened texture of lungs, bilateral

173

focal consolidation, lobar consolidation, ground glass opacity, and patchy consolidation, and

174

unilateral/bilateral pneumonia. Common symptoms reported across the studies include

175

fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue/weakness. Only 15 studies reported some

176

information about the pre-existing conditions of the patients; most of whom had metabolic

177

and cardiovascular underlying conditions.

179

Mean incubation period

180

The estimated mean incubation period obtained from the included studies as well as resulting

181

pooled mean are presented in Fig. 2. Out of the 14 studies included in the meta-analysis, 12

182

were conducted in China. The findings of meta-analysis showed that the mean incubation

183

period was 5.84 (95% CI: 4.83, 6.85) days. Heterogeneity testing (I2=94.7%) revealed notable

184

differences among the included studies in the meta-analysis. Multivariate meta-regression

185

results (Table 2) showed no significant differences in incubation period time by country (China

186

vs. others, Adjusted Beta = 1.70; P-value = 0.484), age (Adjusted Beta = -1.16; P-value = 0.239)

187

or percent of male (Adjusted Beta = -13.07; P-value = 0.09) participants.

188
189

Mean time from onset of symptoms to first clinical visit

190

The estimated mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to first clinical

191

visit was 4.82 (95% CI: 3.48, 6.15). As shown in Fig. 3, out of the 21 studies included in the

192

meta-analysis, only 6 were conducted outside China. Heterogeneity testing (I2=98.0%)

193

revealed notable differences among the included studies in the meta-analysis. Multivariate

194

meta-regression results (Supplement 2) showed no significant differences in time from onset

195

of symptoms to first clinical visit by country (China vs. others, Adjusted Beta = 1.47; P-value =

196

0.456), age (Adjusted Beta = 0.91; P-value = 0.187) or percent of male (Adjusted Beta = -2.96;

197

P-value = 0.614) participants.

Mean time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission

200

The estimated mean number of days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms to ICU admission

201

was 10.48 (95% CI: 9.80, 11.16), an estimate that was derived from one study in Singapore

204

Mean time from onset of symptoms to recovery

205

The estimated mean number of days from the onset of symptoms to recovery was reported

206

in 6 studies and the resulting pooled mean was 17.76 (95% CI: 12.64, 22.87). Only one of the

207

studies was conducted in China and the rest were completed in France, South Korea, UK, and

208

Japan (Fig. 5). Heterogeneity testing (I2=99.0%) revealed notable differences among the

209

included studies in the meta-analysis. Multivariate meta-regression results (Supplement 2)

210

showed no significant differences in time from onset of symptoms to recovery by country

226

Discussion

227

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overview of the

228

epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our findings suggested that the COVID-19 has an

229

incubation time of more than five days (5.84 days) and a lag of less than five days (4.82 days)

230

from onset of symptoms to first clinical visit. On average, the symptoms lasted more than

231

twenty days (17.76 days) before recovery was achieved and the mortality risk among

232

confirmed cases was 2%, which significantly increased by age. Similar to previous studies (21),

233

fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue were common symptoms among the

234

patients in the included studies. As expected, history of direct or indirect exposure to Wuhan

235

was frequent and the most common radiologic findings were bilateral consolidation and

236

pneumonia (22, 23).

237

We found that the average incubation period of COVID-19 infection to be less than 6 days

238

which is broadly consistent with previously reported estimates (24-27). The right tail of the

239

incubation period for COVID-19 even for 99% CI was less than seven days (6.85). This finding

240

is of particular interest as uncertainties continue to exist about the incubation period of

241

COVID-19. For example, while both WHO and United States' CDC suggest an incubation period

242

of 2-14 days, single outlier cases as long as 19 (15), 24 (28) or 27 days (29) have been reported;

243

estimates that are most likely reflecting a double exposure. Our meta-analytic findings are of

244

particular importance for quarantine-related policies and planning and suggest that the

245

current 14-day quarantine period might be rather conservative. Indeed, we found that except

11

246

for one small study from China in Anyang city on a cluster of six patients (Bai 2020 (15)), all

247

other studies reported incubation periods less than 11 days; therefore, a shorter period of 14

248

days would most likely suffice and it is expected that almost all infected people will show

249

symptoms within 11 days of initial exposure. Nonetheless, decisions to modify or keep the

250

existing policies need to weigh the costs of extending active quarantine against the potential

251

or costs of missing a symptomatic case.

252

COVID-19 seems to have a longer incubation period than that of other acute respiratory viral

253

infections (30) such as human coronavirus (3.2 days), influenza A (1.43-1.64 days (31)),

254

parainfluenza (2.6 days), respiratory syncytial virus (4.4 days), and rhinovirus (1.4 days).

255

Furthermore, the median incubation period for SARS has been reported estimated as 4.0 days

256

in 2009 (30), which is considerably lower than what we observed for COVID-19. The longer

257

incubation period of the COVID-19 may be one of the major factors that helps explain its rapid

258

spread in comparison previous respiratory infection viruses. Another factor that contributes

259

to spread of COVID-19 is the lag between the onset of symptoms and first clinical visit and the

260

high number of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. Our results indicated on average it is less

261

than five days (4.82 days), and particularly increases by age (1.94 days increase per each 10

262

years increase in age). This finding suggests that MERS and SARS progress rapidly to sever

263

symptoms and respiratory failures (32) than most cases infected by COVID-19 (33).

264

In compare to MERS-COV with a mortality rate of 35.67% (34) and SARS with a mortality rate

265

of 11% (35), we found that COVID-19 has a much lower mortality rate (2%) which significantly

266

increase by age (48% increase for every 1% increase in male participants). Although this

267

estimate is comparable with previous studies (36, 37), it is important to recognize the

268

limitations of calculating mortality rates of COVID-19 while the epidemic is still growing. As

269

most cases of CVOID-19 remain asymptomatic and may recover without seeking medical care,

12

270

it is likely that the true rate of death among people infected with COVID-19 could be even

271

lower. On the other hand, the estimated mortality rates reported in most studies need to be

272

interpreted with caution as they are often based on the cumulative number of deaths relative

273

to the number of confirmed cases, while patients who die on a given day have been infected

274

at a much earlier date and this would bias the denominator of the mortality rate (38).

275

We acknowledge four main limitations of our systematic review. First, our findings are mainly

276

based on studies that recruited patient from clinics and hospitals and so may be biased

277

toward more severe cases. Second, many studies did not report the study outcomes by

278

subgroups such as age or gender and so we could report group-specific outcomes. Third, we

279

used the mean and the standard error of the incubation period assuming a normal

280

distribution which may have led to underestimate the right tail of the distribution. Lastly,

281

given the urgency of topic and the heterogeneity of the studies included in the review, we did

282

not conduct risk of bias and quality assessment of the studies. Inevitably, given the novelty of

283

COVID-19 and the observational nature of all of the available evidence, they are most likely

284

at a high risk of bias and the quality of existing evidence is low. Nonetheless, our systematic

285

review of literature provides an update on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 which

286

can be helpful for decision making on prevention measures as well as modeling and cost-

287

analysis purposes.

288
289

Conclusions

290

Our findings of the overall epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 have important insight

291

for healthcare systems’ prevention and planning efforts. The incubation period (i.e., <11 days

292

in most studies) and the lag between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis (i.e., <5 days) are

293

longer for COVID-19 compared to other respiratory viral infections including MERS and SARS.

294

Nonetheless, current policies of 14 days of mandatory quarantine for everyone, might be too

295

conservative and longer quarantine periods might be more justified for extreme cases. As

296

effective vaccination or treatment for COVID-19 are yet to be developed, practicing the

297

fundamentals of public health and prevention efforts such as social distancing and personal

298

hygiene are critical and need to be emphasized and enforced further to reduce the

299

transmission risk of COVID-19 to vulnerable populations.
