Optimal control of the COVID-19 pandemic with
non-pharmaceutical interventions
T. Alex Perkins · Guido España

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has forced societies across the world to
resort to social distancing to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due
to the economic impacts of social distancing, there is growing desire to relax
these measures. To characterize a range of possible strategies for control and
to understand their consequences, we performed an optimal control analysis of
a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Given that the pandemic
is already underway and controls have already been initiated, we calibrated
our model to data from the US and focused our analysis on optimal controls
from May 2020 through December 2021. We found that a major factor that
differentiates strategies that prioritize lives saved versus reduced time under
control is how quickly control is relaxed once social distancing restrictions
expire in May 2020. Strategies that maintain control at a high level until
summer 2020 allow for tapering of control thereafter and minimal deaths,
whereas strategies that relax control in the short term lead to fewer options
for control later and a higher likelihood of exceeding hospital capacity. Our
results also highlight that the potential scope for controlling COVID-19 until a
vaccine is available depends on epidemiological parameters about which there
is still considerable uncertainty, including the basic reproduction number and
the effectiveness of social distancing. In light of those uncertainties, our results
do not constitute a quantitative forecast and instead provide a qualitative
portrayal of possible outcomes from alternative approaches to control.

1 Introduction
The first known case of COVID-19 in the United States arrived from China
on January 15, 2020 [22]. In the weeks that followed, deficiencies in testing
allowed the virus that causes this disease to spread largely undetected [41],
with the number of reported cases growing to 429,319 by April 8, 2020 [36].
Social distancing—such as closing schools, working from home, and sheltering
in place—has been adopted widely and appears capable of impacting transmission [26,12]. These practices have tremendous economic and social consequences, however, which has precipitated growing desire to relax them [16].
A danger in relaxing the use of social distancing is that the virus could
resurge in its absence [44]. A safe, effective, and widely used vaccine would obviate the need for social distancing, but there are many challenges associated
with developing a vaccine against COVID-19 [30] and one is not likely to be
available until at least spring 2021 [4]. Strategies for successfully controlling
COVID-19 until then will depend on a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [3], including some degree of social distancing but also diagnostic
testing, contact tracing, and case isolation [5].
In models of pathogen transmission based on mass-action assumptions,
NPIs all act in a similar way by reducing the transmission coefficient. This parameter, often denoted β, reflects the product of the rate of contact between
susceptible and infectious people and the probability of transmission upon contact [24]. Due to the extent to which they reduce contact, full-scale lockdowns
appear to be the most effective strategy for reducing transmission available at
present [18]. Until alternative NPI-based strategies can be implemented that
are similarly effective but less disruptive economically, it is urgently important
to determine the minimal extent to which contact must be reduced to achieve
public health objectives.
Optimal control theory offers a way to understand how to apply one or more
time-varying control measures to a nonlinear, dynamical system in such a way
that a given objective is optimized [28]. These techniques have been widely
applied to a variety of pathogen transmission systems before (e.g., [6, 33,11, 2]),
including in the context of a pandemic of a respiratory pathogen (e.g., [29,48,
46]). The latter studies indicate that the level of NPI-based control required is
dependent on model parameters, and that application of NPIs can be required
at a high level and for a long duration in the absence of a vaccine.
Here, we apply optimal control theory to determine optimal strategies for
the implementation of NPIs to control COVID-19, with a focus on the US. An
optimal strategy in this sense involves weighing the relative costs of control
and COVID-related mortality, and finding an approach to control that minimizes that combined cost. Other optimal control analyses of COVID-19 are
beginning to emerge [14,31,40,43,45], although these have been less focused
on any particular geographic setting. One contextual feature of the US that
our analysis considers is the level of control that was implemented early in the
pandemic. We account for this, because our objective is less about understanding what level of control would have been optimal earlier on and more about

understanding what level of control would be optimal going forward, conditional on what has happened already. In addition, we emphasize the sensitivity
of our results to epidemiological parameters that are not yet well characterized but appear influential in determining what range of impacts of NPIs on
COVID-19 are possible. All code and data used in our analysis is available at

In the model, all individuals are initially susceptible, S, with infections
introduced at a constant rate, ι, from outside the population. Individuals then
transition to the exposed class, E, where they reside for an average of ρ−1
days. A proportion σ experience a symptomatic infection, I. The remainder
experience an asymptomatic infection, A, and have a fraction, α, of the infectiousness of symptomatic infections. Individuals reside in the I and A classes
for an average of γ −1 days. All asymptomatic infections and a proportion

Hospitalizations, H(t)
Fig. 1 Relationship between the number of hospitalizations and the probability of death
from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. The parameters ∆− and ∆+ represent lower
and upper bounds on the probability of death, and Hmax represents the hospital capacity above which the probability of death exceeds ∆− . Hospitalizations are quantified as a
proportion of the overall population.

1 − κ of symptomatic infections then recover and become fully immune to
subsequent infection. The remaining proportion κ of symptomatic infections
transition to the hospitalized class, H, from which they exit through either
recovery or death after an average of η −1 days.
Rather than track deaths due to COVID-19, D(t), as a state variable in
eqn. (1), we assume that they follow directly from hospitalizations, H(t), according to

D(t) =

ηH(t)∆−
 , H(t) ≤ Hmax .
ηH(t) ∆− + (∆+ − ∆− ) 1 − eh(H(t)−Hmax ) , H(t) > Hmax

This results in the probability of death moving beyond a minimum of ∆− towards a maximum of ∆+ as H(t) exceeds Hmax , as illustrated in Figure 1. The
motivation for this choice is to account for the possibility that patients could
experience increased mortality when the demand for certain resources, such
as intensive care unit beds or ventilators, exceeds their availability. One other
optimal control analysis of COVID-19 has incorporated a similar phenomenon
[43], albeit with a different functional form.
Individuals who are recovered and immune are not followed explicitly, as
the model’s assumption of density-dependent transmission only requires spec-

ification of susceptible and infectious classes in the transmission term. Due to
our assumption that rates of birth, µ, and death due to reasons other than
COVID-19, δ, are equal, changes in population size over the course of the
epidemic are modest, making the distinction between density- and frequencydependent transmission negligible.
The primary form of control in the model is achieved through the variable
u, which represents a proportional reduction in the transmission coefficient,
β. As is standard for mass-action models of directly-transmitted pathogens, β
reflects the product of the rate at which susceptible and infectious individuals
come into contact and the probability of transmission given that a contact has
occurred [24]. Thus, a wide range of NPIs could result in changes in u, including
school closures, work from home policies, and shelter in place mandates, as
well as more targeted approaches, such as isolation based on self-awareness of
symptoms or contact tracing. In addition to control through u, the V class
represents individuals who have been vaccinated, with individuals entering
V from S at rate ν beginning on day τν . We assume that vaccination may
not provide complete protection, resulting in vaccinated individuals becoming
infected at a fraction 1 −  of the rate at which fully susceptible individuals
become infected.

2.2 Basic reproduction number, R0
At its core, the behavior of this model is similar to that of an SEIR model with
demography. Because analyses of the transient and asymptotic properties of
this class of models are plentiful in textbooks and elsewhere (e.g., [24]), we omit
such an analysis here. We do, however, derive a formula to express the basic
reproduction number, R0 , as a function of model parameters. This relationship
plays a role in how we parameterize the model.
We use the next-generation method [15] to obtain a formula describing R0
as a function of model parameters. This method depends on matrices F and
V, whose elements are defined as the rates at which secondary infections increase the ith compartment and the rates at which disease progression, death,
and recovery decrease the ith compartment, respectively. For “disease compartments” E, A, I, and H, these matrices are defined as

subject to the constraints of the state dynamics described in eqn. (1) and
the initial conditions that S(t0 ) = 1 and all other state variables equal zero
at time t0 . The parameter c weights the extent to which the control, u(t), is
prioritized for minimization relative to deaths, D(t). Squared terms for D(t)
and u(t) are chosen both for mathematical convenience in the case of u(t) and
to more heavily penalize solutions for u(t) that permit relatively high values
of D(t) or u(t) at any given time.
To find the optimal control, u∗ (t), that minimizes J(u), we follow standard
results from optimal control theory applied to systems of ordinary differential

equations [28]. These techniques make use of Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle
to determine the pointwise minimum of the Hamiltonian of the system, H,
using adjoint variables, λ, that correspond to each of the state variables.
To solve for the adjoint variables, we first define the Hamiltonian,

H = D2 + c u2 + λS (µ − (δ + β(1 − u)(αA + I + H) + ι + ν) S)
+ λE (β(1 − u)(αA + I + H) (S + (1 − )V ) + ιS − (δ + ρ) E)
+ λA ((1 − σ)ρE − (δ + γ) A) + λI (σρE − (δ + γ) I) + λH (γκI − (δ + η) H)
+ λV (νS − (δ + β(1 − u)(αA + I + H)(1 − )) V ) . (8)
We then define differential equations describing the behavior of each adjoint
variable as the negative of the partial derivative of H with respect to the state
variable corresponding to each adjoint variable. This yields

The optimal control is subject to a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of
umax , with those values used for u∗ whenever the right hand side of eq. (10)
yields values outside those bounds.
To find u∗ (t) numerically, we use the forward-backward sweep method [28],
which involves first solving for the state variables forward in time, next solving
for the adjoint variables backward in time, and then plugging the solutions for
the relevant state and adjoint variables into eqn. (10), subject to bounds on
u(t). As is often the case for optimal control problems [28], we found that we
needed to perform these steps iteratively and with a convex combination of
controls across iterations to achieve convergence. Specifically, we repeated the
forward-backward sweep process 50 times, after which we took newly proposed
solutions of u∗ (t) as the average of the 20 most recent solutions, until the
algorithm was stopped after 2,000 iterations. We assessed convergence with a
statistic defined as
P

∀t
P new

− uold |

where smaller values indicate better convergence. All numerical solutions were
obtained with a Runge-Kutta 4 routine implemented with the ode function
from the deSolve package [47] in R.

2.4 Model parameterization
In Table 2, we specify low, intermediate, and high values of each parameter.
For some parameters, estimates matching our parameter definitions were taken
from other studies. For other parameters, additional steps were necessary to
match our parameter definitions. We elaborate on the latter below.
Transmission coefficient, β. We based values of this parameter on assumptions
about R0 by solving for β as a function of R0 and other parameters in eqn. (6).
Because estimates of R0 for COVID-19 vary widely [39], we chose values that
span a range of estimates that may be applicable to the US.
Background birth and death rates, µ and δ. We parameterized µ consistent
with a rate of 3,791,712 births in a population of 331 million in the US in 2018
[32]. To achieve a constant population size in the absence of COVID-19, we
set δ equal to µ.

Probability of death among hospitalized cases, ∆ and h. We assume that ∆−
is equal to early estimates from the US (2.6%) [9] and that ∆+ is equal to
estimates from Italy (7.2%) [38]. Estimates of how quickly ∆+ might be approached have not been made empirically, so the value of h was assumed. The
intermediate value of h = 701 corresponds to an increase of H of 50% beyond
Hmax resulting in 50% of the maximum increase from ∆− to ∆+ .
Progression through hospitalization, η. We used line-list data [1] to estimate
a mean (13.2 days) and standard deviation (7.39 days) of the time between
hospital admission and either discharge or death.
Timing of vaccine introduction, τν . Experts have stated that a vaccine against
COVID-19 could be available to the public by spring 2021 [4]. We used April
1, 2021 as our default value for this parameter.
Vaccination rate, ν. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 100 million doses of vaccine
were administered between October 2009 and April 2010 [7, 8]. Consistent
with that, our default value of ν resulted in 0.197% of the population being
vaccinated each day.
Hospital capacity, Hmax . We based our definition of this parameter on hospital
beds and did not include other aspects of hospital resources, such as ICU beds,
ventilators, or hospital staffing. Specifically, we adopted an estimate of 312,090
beds available for COVID-19 patients in the US by the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation [50].
Maximum effect of control, umax . A model incorporating survey data and agebased contact patterns estimated that social distancing could reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by 73% [23]. Based on this, we used 0.7 as an intermediate
value of this parameter and 0.5 and 0.9 as lower and upper values.

2.5 Model calibration
To obtain realistic behavior of the model, we calibrated it to match the cumulative number of reported deaths in the US within the first 100 days of
2020 (i.e., by April 9), which we obtained from the New York Times [36]. We
focused our calibration on the parameter ι, due to the difficulty of empirically
estimating the rate at which imported infections appear. To obtain a value
of ι that resulted in the model matching the reported number of deaths, we
simulated the model across 300 values of ι evenly spaced between 10−12 and
10−4 on a log scale, performed a linear interpolation of the simulated number
of deaths across those values of ι, and found the value of ι that most closely
matched reported deaths.
We calibrated the model under a total of 18 different parameter scenarios,
crossing low, intermediate, and high values of R0 with low, intermediate, and

high values of umax and low and high values of ω. The latter represents the
proportion of all deaths caused by COVID-19 that were reported. Because
NPIs began going into effect in the US within the timeframe of this calibration
period, we calibrated the model subject to an assumed pattern of u(t) through
the first 100 days of 2020. We chose a logistic functional form for this, with
a minimum of 0 and a maximum of umax . Two parameters that control the
midpoint and slope of the increase from 0 to umax were selected by an informal
process of trial and error, with the goal of having the model’s predictions of
deaths over time match the timing of reported deaths under all 18 parameter
scenarios. We also used this process to select the date on which importations
were initiated through ι.

3 Results
3.1 Model calibration
Under each of the 18 different scenarios we considered about R0 , umax , and ω,
our model was able to reproduce the numbers and timing of reported deaths
in the US reasonably well (Figure 2). Different values of ι were required to
do so under different values of those other three parameters, but all values
of ι ranged 10−7 - 10−6 (Table 3). Taking into account the population of the
US, this equates to a range of 33 - 331 imported infections per day. Higher
values of R0 resulted in lower values of ι, given that fewer importations were
required to generate the reported numbers of deaths when there was more
local transmission. For similar reasons, ι was lower when umax was lower. The
value of ω had a negligible effect on ι.
In addition to ι, we also calibrated the date on which importations began
(February 1) and u(t) during the first 100 days of 2020. Even though the
first imported cases in the US began appearing before February 1 [22], it is

not surprising that our model better matched the data with a slightly later
start date, given that the model did not allow for increases in importation
over time, as likely occurred [41]. The calibration of u(t) was consistent with
u(t) starting at zero, reaching half of umax on April 4, 2020, and increasing
by a maximum of 0.075 umax per day around that time. The timing of these
changes is approximately two weeks later than changes in Google mobility
data from the US [20], which may be a consequence of our model moving
some individuals from exposure to death too quickly given that residence time
in each compartment is exponentially distributed.
In general, we do not interpret any of the calibrated parameter values as
reliable estimates of empirical quantities. Such an interpretation would require
analyses that more carefully account for data-generating processes and sources
of uncertainty. Rather, our objective in this calibration exercise was to ensure
that the model’s behavior is reasonably consistent with empirical data, which
we feel was accomplished.

3.2 Convergence
For our main results, we obtained solutions to u∗ (t) under a total of 126
parameter combinations, crossing the 18 parameter sets in Table 3 with seven
values of c spanning 10−12 to 10−6 by factors of ten. In one representative
example (Figure 3, left), we observed that solutions of u∗ (t) converged to a set
of similar solutions after several hundred iterations. As expected, the objective
functional decreased during those initial iterations and remained low thereafter

Fig. 3 Convergence of solutions of u∗ (t) under parameters R0 = 3, umax = 0.9, ω = 0.8,
and c = 10−12 . Left: Colors indicate values of u∗ (t) for each day in 2020 and 2021 across
2,000 iterations of the forward-backward sweep algorithm. Right: Across iterations, the value
of the objective functional, J(u), decreased steadily until cycling for the remaining iterations.

(Figure 3, right). To assess convergence by the statistic in eqn. (11), we selected
the iterations with the ten lowest values of J(u) in the last 100 iterations. Of
126 parameter combinations, 78% had final solutions of u∗ (t) with convergence
statistics below 10−5 , 94% below 10−2 , and all below 10−1 .
3.3 Minimized objective functional under different parameters
Rt
Comparing values of the two components of the objective functional, t01 D(t)2 dt
Rt
and t01 u(t)2 dt, across different parameter values provides insight into the
range of behavior of the model and its response to control. Because they
are similar to the components of the objective functional
R t but more easily
interpretable, we describe effects of model parameters on t01 D(t)dt (cumulaRt
tive deaths) and t01 u(t)dt (cumulative time under control). The parameter c,
which controls the weight of the two terms in J(u), led to a transition from
minimizing cumulative deaths to minimizing cumulative time spent under control as it varied from 10−9 to 10−6 (Figure 4). The parameters R0 and umax
both influenced the extent to which cumulative deaths could be minimized.
With a high value of umax , deaths could be kept relatively low across all values
of R0 explored, provided that c ≤ 10−10 . With a low value of umax and a high
value of R0 , cumulative deaths could only be reduced by around 10% as c varied across its entire range from 10−12 to 10−6 . The parameter ω had essentially
no influence on the components of the objective functional (Figure 4).
3.4 Optimal control over time
We first consider the scenario where R0 = 3 and umax = 0.9, because those
are the conditions under which control has the greatest potential to influence

the pandemic. Under c = 10−12 , u∗ (t) remains at umax until late June 2020,
after which it settles down to around 75% of umax until late 2021 (Figure 5).
This results in hospitalizations dropping from their peak in April 2020 and
remaining very low through 2021. The susceptible population remains very
high and only begins eroding once a vaccine is introduced.
With a higher value of c = 10−9 , u∗ (t) drops to around 50% of umax in
May 2020 (Figure 5). As a result, hospitalizations rebound and exceed hospital
capacity by around a third in June and July before falling again, after u∗ (t)
returns to umax . From August 2020 onward, a steady decline in u∗ (t) allows
hospitalizations to be maintained at moderate levels before rebounding and
exceeding hospital capacity once again for several months in 2021.
With the highest value of c = 10−6 , u∗ (t) drops almost to zero at the
beginning of May 2020 (Figure. 7). This results in a rapid increase in hospitalizations, which is followed by an increase in u∗ (t). By the end of June,
the susceptible population has been depleted to the point that herd immunity
begins to obviate the need for control and u∗ (t) declines to zero by October
2020. During this large second wave in summer 2020, hospital capacity is ex-

ceeded by more than 20-fold. This results in cumulative deaths equaling 5% of
the population, which is approximately one order of magnitude greater than
when c = 10−9 and two orders of magnitude greater than when c = 10−12 .
Under other conditions about the transmissibility of the virus and the
potential for NPIs to reduce transmission, control is less capable of curtailing the epidemic. With R0 = 3.5 and umax = 0.7, hospitalizations peak in
early summer 2020 at twice hospital capacity and take until December 2020
to fall below hospital capacity, even with the most aggressive value of c that
we considered (10−12 ) (Figure 8). With R0 = 4, umax = 0.5, and c = 10−12 ,
hospitalizations peak in summer 2020 at thirty times hospital capacity (Figure 9). This results in extensive herd immunity and the relaxation of control
in 2021, albeit at the cost of extensive deaths (Figure 4). Optimal controls

initiated one to three weeks earlier or later in spring 2020 would affect optimal
controls in the period after. We focus this analysis on scenarios in which c =
10−12 , which results in the optimal control problem seeking to minimize deaths
as aggressively as any scenario that we explored. Consequently, we interpret
changes in the optimal control in this section to reflect changes in constraints
on what solutions of u∗ (t) are possible, rather than changes in the balance
between D(t)2 and u(t)2 in the optimization.
Across all combinations of R0 , umax , and ω that we considered, cumulative deaths through 2020 and 2021 decrease when control begins earlier and
increase when control begins later (Figure 10, red). In the scenario in which a
delay in the initiation of control has the smallest effect (R0 = 3, umax = 0.5),
cumulative deaths increase by 10% with a three-week delay. In the scenario
in which a delay in the initiation of control has the largest effect (R0 = 4,
umax = 0.9), cumulative deaths increase 28-fold with a three-week delay.
The overall amount of time spent under control throughout 2020 and 2021
increases when control begins earlier and decreases when control begins later
(Figure 10, blue). This is the case across all combinations of R0 , umax , and ω
that we considered. In part, this owes to less time spent under control through
April 30, 2020, when u(t) is fixed and not subject to optimization. In addition though, delays in the initiation of control result in a higher prevalence of
infection by the beginning of the optimization period, which results in higher
levels of subsequent transmission, greater depletion of the susceptible population, and less need for control later in the period of optimization (compare
Figure 11 with Figure 5).

4 Discussion
Under our model, the ability of NPIs to minimize deaths depends to a large
extent on the maximum effect that NPIs could have on transmission, as captured by the parameter umax . If umax is high (0.9), our model predicts that
maintaining transmission at a low enough level that hospital capacity will not
be exceeded could be possible. If umax is low (0.5), our model predicts that
there may be limited scope to curtail the pandemic, even if control is sustained
for a long period of time. If umax is intermediate (0.7), our model predicts that
the potential impact of control is sensitive to the value of R0 . These results
emphasize the importance of careful estimation of these parameters as the
pandemic progresses [18]. This includes accounting for geographic differences
in both umax and R0 [19, 21].
The balance between minimizing deaths versus days under control is determined by the parameter c in our model, which mirrors the weighting between
these factors that government leaders will need to consider as they make decisions in coming months. In the event that NPIs are effective, our analysis
shows that they will need to be sustained at a high level until sometime in
summer 2020, at which time they can be relaxed to a small degree but will
still need to be maintained at a relatively high level thereafter. Scenarios that

Timing of initial increase in control relative to default timing (days)

place greater weight on minimizing days under control provide insight into the
possible consequences of relaxing NPIs prematurely. In a scenario in which
the effect of NPIs is reduced moderately in May, resuming NPIs at high levels
soon after becomes necessary to react to a second wave later in the summer.
In a scenario in which NPIs are reduced more drastically in May, an extremely
large second wave occurs in summer 2020 that exceeds hospital capacity many
times over.
Our conclusion that prolonged control is needed to avoid a resurgence that
would greatly exceed healthcare capacity is in line with results from other
modeling studies [13,37, 17,25, 51]. Some differ though in that they consider
scenarios in which control is implemented intermittently, with periods of relaxed control in between periods of maximal control [17,25, 51]. In the limited
number of direct comparisons of intermittent and continuous strategies that
have been performed for COVID-19 to date, continuous strategies appear to
be capable of more effectively limiting transmission to low levels [14,52]. The
sustainability of either strategy would benefit from the ability to transition

away from heightened social distancing and more toward diagnostic testing,
contact tracing, and case isolation [51, 43].
Our results tend to agree with those from other optimal control analyses
of COVID-19, although our analysis goes beyond those studies in some ways.
In general, ours and other studies share the conclusion that heightened control
early in the pandemic is important for achieving long-term success. Like our
analysis, some anticipate that partial relaxation of controls may be possible
over time [14, 45], whereas others focus on strategies intended to have a more
limited duration to begin with [40, 35, 43]. Importantly though, our analysis
goes further than others in exploring sensitivity of the optimal control to
model parameters. Specifically, we show that preventing a large wave that
overwhelms health systems may not even be possible under some parameter
combinations (low umax , high R0 ) and that prioritizing the minimization of
deaths versus days under control leads to vastly different outcomes. We also
constrain levels of control applied through April 2020, making the optimization
more relevant to future decision making. Shifting the timing of the initiation
of control shows that constraints about past levels of control strongly affect
future possibilities for the extent to which deaths can be minimized and the
level of control required to achieve that, consistent with other results [27].
The goal of our analysis is to provide qualitative insights into the implications of alternative approaches to control, rather than to make quantitative
predictions about future events. Some key limitations of using our model for

Optimal control of COVID-19

the latter purpose include our omission of subnational variation in epidemic
dynamics [42,49], differentiation among alternative NPIs [18], and age differences in contact patterns [23] and risk of hospitalization [9]. At least with
respect to the possibility of different levels of control for different age groups,
one study found that age-specific optimal controls were all relatively similar
for NPIs against pandemic influenza [46]. Additional limitations that affect
our model’s suitability for making future predictions include its deterministic
nature and the rudimentary calibration procedure that we performed, which
was sufficient to provide a basis for qualitative analyses but that would need
refinement for application of our model to inference or forecasting.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that we are at a critical juncture in the
pandemic, when decisions about the continuation or relaxation of NPI-based
control strategies could have major implications for the possibility of keeping
transmission below levels that health systems can cope with. At the same time,
our analysis highlights the role that constraints play in determining optimal
levels of control going forward, both in terms of constraints on epidemiological
parameters and on levels of control prior to the time that a decision is made
about future actions. Going forward, reducing transmission in the near term
would give decision makers greater flexibility in the range of decisions available to them in the future, and gathering high-quality data could help reduce
uncertainty about the consequences of those decisions.
