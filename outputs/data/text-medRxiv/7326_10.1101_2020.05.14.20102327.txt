15

sodium chloride aerosol with count median diameter of 75 nm ± 20 nm and geometric

respirators’ ability to protect against submicrometer particles.

converted both mobility diameter and equivalent volume diameter to aerodynamic

(with the filtration efficiency of 72%±3% for ≥300 nm sodium chloride aerosol) still

21

passed the test with a measured overall filtration efficiency of 98%±3%, due to its larger

most penetrating particle size compared to the typical N95 respirator. In addition, after

23

three cycle H2O2 plasma vaporous sterilizations, the most penetrating particle size for

24

the N95 grade respirators also shifted to 250 nm – 500 nm, in which size the particles

efficiency and overall filtration efficiency using the same NaCl test aerosol. For

28

example, after three cycle H2O2 plasma vaporous sterilizations, the size specific

29

filtration efficiency of the N95 was 55%±2%, however, the measured overall filtration

30

efficiency was still 86%±5%. The size Specific filtration efficiency of the KN95 was

31

69%±2%, but, the measured overall filtration efficiency was still 90%±3%. In order to

32

protect health care personnel adequately, we recommend increasing the test aerosol size,

33

and measuring the size specific filtration efficiency to evaluate the N95 alternatives (e.g.

34

KN95), and the reuse of N95 level respirators. In addition, multi-cycle sterilization

35

with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation appears to have fewer negative effects than H2O2.

1. Introduction
Recent studies indicates that aerosol transmission of the severe acute respiratory

42

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is plausible since the virus can remain viable and

43

infectious in aerosol form for hours (1,2). Wearing personal protective equipment (e.g. N95

44

respirator) could be an effective strategy before the effective vaccines or antiviral drugs. The

45

N95 grade respirator should have a minimum filtration efficiency of 95% for ≥300 nm

46

(aerodynamic diameter) sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic

47

and shortage of mask supplies (3), some studies analyzed the reuse of N95/KN95 respirators

48

after sterilization by measuring the filtration efficiency using NaCl test aerosol (4,5).

49

However, in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Institute of

50

Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) procedure No. TEB-APR-STP-0059, the count

51

median diameter (CMD) of the NaCl test aerosol is 75 nm ± 20 nm with the geometric

52

standard deviation (GSD) ≤1.86, which might be too small compared to the particles

53

containing infectious agents.

54

The peak concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals was found in 250 nm – 500

55

nm (aerodynamic diameter) particles (6), although the actual SARS-CoV-2 size ranges only

56

from 60 nm – 150 nm (7,8,9). Since the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) for typical

57

N95 respirators is 30 nm – 100 nm (10), the CDC NIOSH recommends using the NaCl test

58

aerosol with a CMD of 75 nm ± 20 nm and GSD of ≤1.86. However, using this size NaCl

59

test aerosol means that around 89.9% particles are ≤250 nm (aerodynamic diameter), which is

60

not in the particle size range of containing the peak concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 in

61

hospitals. The light-scattering instruments (e.g., aerosol photometer), which are commonly

62

used for filtration efficiency test, are usually limited to measuring aerosol larger than 100 nm

63

(11); still around 84.6% particles are ≤250 nm (aerodynamic diameter) if a photometer is

64

used during the test. Therefore, a respirator efficient for particles ≤250 nm may not capture

65

most SARS-CoV-2, and the size specific filtration efficiency is a better assessment of the

66

respirator’s protection ability rather than the overall filtration efficiency to prevent the SARS-

67

CoV-2 transmit via airborne particles.

68

The goal of this demonstration study was to compare the size specific filtration

69

efficiency to the overall filtration efficiency through testing an untreated (new) KN95, and

70

treated (multiple sterilization cycles) KN95/N95 respirators.

71

72

2. Methods

73

2.1 Experimental Setup

74

We tested KN95 respirators from over 20 various manufacturers, and selected two of

75

them (one qualified and one unqualified) for analysis in this study. We analyzed the reasons

76

why the unqualified KN95 respirator (Nine Particles Medical Equipment Co, Ltd, Yongzhou,

77

Hunan, China) still passed the test using the NIOSH recommended NaCl test aerosol. We

78

also compared the effects of two- and three-cycle sterilization using vaporous plasma

79

hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation on the filtration

80

efficiencies by size of KN95 (qualified one from Civilian Antivirus, Qingdao, Shandong,

81

China) and N95 (model 1860, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) respirator. The experimental setup

82

was illustrated in previous study (12). A NaCl aerosol was generated using a Collision

83

Nebulizer (3 jet, CH Technologies, Westwood, NJ, USA) operated at 20 psi using 2% NaCl

84

aerosol recommended by NIOSH procedure No. TEB-APR-STP-0059. We tested five

85

samples for each respirator. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, model 3936, TSI Inc.,

86

Shoreview, MN, USA) was used to measure the number concentration of test aerosol from

87

16.8 nm to 514 nm up and down stream of each sample. We conducted a two-sample t-test

88

(with α=0.05 as significance threshold) to compare the mean filtration efficiency of the five

89

samples at each aerosol size between two and three sterilization cycles.

90

2.2 Diameter Conversion
In this study, we converted both mobility diameter and equivalent volume diameter to

91
92

aerodynamic diameter for comparison. The equations are from literature (13, 14):

93

𝑑𝑚
𝑑𝑣𝑒 𝜒𝑡
=
𝐶𝑐(𝑑𝑚 ) 𝐶𝑐(𝑑𝑣𝑒 )

94

where dm and dve are mobility diameter and volume equivalent diameter, respectively; Cc(dm)

95

and Cc(dve) are the respective slip correction factors for dm and dve; χt is the dynamic shape

96

factor in transition regime.

𝑑𝑎 = 𝑑𝑣𝑒 √

97

1 𝜌𝑝 𝐶𝑐(𝑑𝑣𝑒 )
𝜒 𝜌0 𝐶𝑐(𝑑𝑎 )

98

where da is aerodynamic diameter; ρp and ρ0 are particle density and standard density (1g cm-

99

3

), respective; Cc(da) is the slip correction factors for da; χ is the dynamic shape factor. The

100

salt aerosol density is 1.75 – 1.99 g cm-3, and the dynamic shape factor is 1.05 – 1.14 from

101

measurements (15). Therefore, we assumed the salt aerosol density of 1.8 g cm-3 and shape

102

factor of 1.1 in this study.

3. Results

104

3.1 Effects of test aerosol size on filtration efficiency

105

We found an interesting case for an unqualified KN95 shown in Figure 1. The results

106

showed that the respirator passed the filtration efficiency test with an overall filtration

107

efficiency of 98±3%, and an acceptable pressure drop of 0.173 "wg ± 0.015 "wg (Figure 1a).

108

However, by looking at the filtration efficiency by aerosol size, this respirator is not qualified

109

as a N95 grade respirator since the filtration efficiency for particles ≥300 nm is 72%±3%,

110

which is much lower than a minimum of 95% (Figure 1b).

overall filtration efficiency would gradually decrease from 97% to 82% by increasing the test

aerosol CMAD from 79 nm to 278 nm.

3.2 Effects of multi-cycle sterilization on the filtration efficiency
The effects of multi-cycle sterilization on the filtration efficiency by aerosol size are

126

summarized in Figure 3. After three H2O2 sterilization cycles, the filtration efficiency for

127

250 nm – 500 nm particles dropped from 84%±2% to 69%±2% for KN95, and from 97%±2%

128

to 55%±2% for N95. The differences between two and three cycles were significant for both

129

KN95 (p-value = 0.014±0.014) and N95 (p-value = 0.0009±0.0008). After UV sterilization,

130

the filtration efficiency of KN95 for 250 nm – 500 nm particles was 94.4%±1.0% after two

131

cycles, and 95.0%±0.6% after three cycles; and the filtration efficiency of N95 was

132

95.9%±1.4% after two cycles, and 96.9%±0.7% after three cycles. The differences were not

133

statistically significant between two and three cycles for both KN95 (p-value = 0.852±0.093)

The size specific filtration efficiency is quite different from the overall filtration

144

efficiency, especially after three cycle H2O2 treatment (see Table 1). For instance, the overall

145

filtration efficiencies for KN95 and N95 after three cycle H2O2 treatment are 90%±3% and

146

86%±5%, respectively; however, the size specific filtration efficiencies are only 69%±2% for

147

KN95 and 55%±2% for N95, respectively. The big difference between the size specific

148

filtration efficiency and the overall filtration efficiency might be due to the MPPS shift after

149

three cycle H2O2 treatment. The MPPS shifted from nanoparticle sizes (see Figure 4) to

150

submicrometer particle sizes (see Figure 3), which are not the majority of the NaCl test aerosol

151

size.

4. Discussion

156

This study proposed that the current NaCl test aerosol size might need to be increased

157

for testing the new KN95 respirator, and the reuse of N95 level respirators after sterilizations

158

due to their much larger MPPS compared to traditional N95 respirators’. In addition to

159

considering the overall filtration efficiency, the filtration efficiencies for particle sizes similar

160

to infectious particles should be considered. This study also found that the two different

161

multi-cycle sterilization processes have unique effects on the filtration efficiencies by aerosol

162

size of different respirators. Multi-cycle sterilization with UV appears to have fewer negative

163

effects than H2O2. Limitations include the small variety of respirator manufacturers and the

164

limited numbers of samples (n=5) for each respirator and only two sterilization techniques

165

evaluated. In addition, this study only evaluated the filtration efficiency after three

166

sterilization cycles as this corresponds with guidance from the American College of Surgeons

167

for H2O2 sterilization. The filter material might degrade further with more cycles, which
