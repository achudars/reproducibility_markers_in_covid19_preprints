Abstract
Background
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many animal
species. Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Many studies suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 gene may influence the
host susceptibility/resistance to SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the functional role of ACE2 in
human pathophysiology. However, all these studies have been conducted in silico based on
epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in
a cohort of 99 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19) to experimental demonstrate allelic association with disease severity.
Methods
By whole-exome sequencing we analysed 99 DNA samples of severely and extremely severely
COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata” and Bambino
Gesù Hospital in Rome.
Results
We identified three different germline variants, one intronic (c.439+4G>A) and two missense
(c.2158A>G, p.Asn720Asp; c.1888G>C, p.Asp630His ), in 26 patients with a similar frequency
between male and female and a not statistically different frequency, except for c.1888G>C,
(p.Asp630His) with the ethnically matched populations (EUR).
Conclusions
Our results suggest that there is not any ACE2 exonic allelic association with disease severity. It is
possible that rare susceptibility alleles are located in the non-coding region of the gene able to
control ACE2 gene activity. It is therefore of interest, to explore the existence of ACE2
susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V2 in these regulatory regions. In addition, we found no
significant evidence that ACE2 alleles is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian
population.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many animal
species, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans and
then spread between people with the exceptions of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERSCoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2,
which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1; 2).
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes an extensively glycosylated spike (S) protein that protrudes from the viral
surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate host-cell entry (3). ACE2binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2
is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may contribute to the higher infectivity and
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (4). Many studies suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 gene
may influence the host susceptibility/resistance to SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the functional
role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology (2). However, all these studies have been conducted in
silico based on epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of
ACE2 variants in a cohort of 99 Italian SARS-CoV-2 -positive patients by direct exome sequencing.
Results and Discussion
We analysed by exome sequencing 99 DNA samples of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the
University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata” in Rome and Bambino Gesù Hospital, Rome. All
patients were clinically diagnosed as COVID-19 based on clinical suspicion and confirmed by viral
RNA detection at oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. All the selected patients were severely
or extremely severely affected. Nine patients in the extremely severe group are passed away. The
majority of the enrolled patients were males (61males, 38 females). Median age was 63 years
(range: 2–92 years), 64 patients were under 65 years old. Ten patients were children (median age
was 11.5 years) showing a severe form of the disease but none of them have Kawasaki-like
syndrome (6). The analytical procedure received approval by the local ethics committee at
University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata (protocol no. 50/20).
We identified in ACE2 gene, three different germline variants, one intronic (c.439+4G>A) and two
missense ( c.2158A>G, p.Asn720Asp; c.1888G>C, p.Asp630His ), in 26 patients (14 females and
12 males). The frequency of the three variants identified are similar between male and female
patients suggesting that there is not gender effects underlying the frequency distribution of ACE2
variants. (Table 1).
GnomAD database analysis revealed that the identified ACE2 variants existed with a cumulative
frequency of 0.2289 in ethnically matched populations (EUR). The frequency of the variants

detected in our examined cohort (0.2119) was not statistically different (Table 1). A significant
difference was detected only for the c.1888G>C (p.Asp630His) observed in a heterozygous female
(p=0.0067) (Table 1). The allelic frequency of this variant in GnomAD for the EUR reference
population is 0.000036 confirming that this is a very rare allele. To predict the potential impact of
this variant on the protein we used different tools (PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster, SIFT,
MetaLR_pred, and MetaSVM_pred.). The in-silico analyses gave conflicting computational verdict
because 3 benign predictions vs. 2 pathogenic predictions. The sequence alignment of the ACE2
protein with its orthologous proteins shows that the wild type residue is not highly conserved in
species implying an irrelevant functional or structural role of this residue in the ACE protein.
Concerning the others two variants, the recurrent c.439+4A>G (rs2285666) intronic variant has
been previously reported by Strafella et al. (5) and by Asselta et al.(4) in two different Italian
cohort representative of the country’s population. The variant is located in the intron 3 in a splice
site region of the gene. However, using Human Splicing Finder (HSF) the analysis showed no
significant splicing alterations.
The missense variant c.2158A>G (p.Asn720Asp) was found in two patients, 1 female in
heterozygous state and 1 male, with a frequency in line with the frequency reported for the
European non-Finnish population in the GnomAD database. It is in the C-terminal domain that is
not involved in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein interaction. The in-silico analyses to predict the
potential impact of this variant on the protein gave benign computational verdict because 4 benign
predictions vs 1 pathogenic prediction.
Numerous in silico data suggested that the ACE2 variants in structural part of the protein could
have an impact on the pathogen binding dynamics or increase the quantitative expression of ACE2.
All these studies were carried out on an epidemiological basis of population allele frequencies
deposited in the various databases available. We systematically analyzed the ACE2 coding-region
variants in a representative cohort of Italian patients severely affected by COVID-19 in order to
identify rare and causative predisposing alleles. Although we have identified a variant
(p.Asp630His), very rare in European population, in a single patient affected by COVID-19, we do
not believe that there is an enrichment of ACE2 coding mutant alleles in the population of Italian
patients affected by COVID-19. Our results confirm and extend that ACE2 is a gene with low allelic
frequencies of missense variants as expected on the basis of GnomAD population data. In fact, we
provide evidence that the rate of amino acid changes in the binding region with SARS-Co-V2 and
at the protein cleavage sites is very low. This suggests that these regions have been under
evolutionary pressure, probably for the essential catalytic role of ACE2 as transmembrane
carboxypeptidase. It is possible that rare susceptibility alleles are located in the non-coding region

of the gene able to control ACE2 gene activity. Mutant alleles in noncoding DNA can cause
alteration in expression levels or disturbing the timing of the expression (1). These variations
concern enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers or regions that provide instructions for
producing functional RNA molecules, such as transfer RNA, miRNAs or long non-coding RNA. It
is therefore of interest, to explore the existence of ACE2 susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V2 in
these regulatory regions. Interestingly very recently Bunyavanich et al. (10) have showed agedependent expression of ACE2 gene in nasal epithelium, highlighting how the different level of
expression of ACE2 may be the reason for explaining why COVID-19 is less frequent in children
(10). Several studies have shown that ACE2 gene undergoes the action of at least four miRNAs:
miR-200c, let-7b, miR-1246, and miR-125b (11-14). Genes coding for these miRNAs could reveal
variations able to modulate the expression and therefore produce significant quantitative differences
in the ACE2 protein.
