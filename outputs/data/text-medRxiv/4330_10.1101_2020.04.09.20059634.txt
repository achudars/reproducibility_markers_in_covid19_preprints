Abstract
In the midst of epidemics such as COVID-19, therapeutic candidates are unlikely to be able
to complete the usual multi-year clinical trial and regulatory approval process within the
course of an outbreak. We apply a Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model‚Äîwhich
minimizes the expected harm of false positives and false negatives‚Äîto optimize the clinical
trial development path during such outbreaks. When the epidemic is more infectious and
fatal, the Bayesian-optimal sample size in the clinical trial is lower and the optimal statistical
significance level is higher. For COVID-19 (assuming a static ùëÖ
2 and initial infection
percentage of 0.1%), the optimal significance level is 7.1% for a clinical trial of a non-vaccine
anti-infective therapeutic clinical trial and 13.6% for that of a vaccine. For a dynamic ùëÖ
ranging from 2 to 4, the corresponding values are 14.4% and 26.4%, respectively. Our
results illustrate the importance of adapting the clinical trial design and the regulatory
approval process to the specific parameters and stage of the epidemic.

1 Introduction
With growing public concern over the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
significant efforts have been undertaken by global biomedical stakeholders to develop
effective diagnostics, vaccines, anti-viral drugs, medical devices, and other therapeutics
against this highly infectious and deadly pandemic. While in the past, the traditional
randomized clinical trial (RCT) and regulatory approval process often took several years (U.S.
Food & Drug Administration, 2018)‚Äîlonger than the typical duration of an epidemic
outbreak (Pronker et al. 2013)‚Äîrecently the FDA has responded with actions such as the
Breakthrough Devices Program, Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority, and
Immediately in Effect guidance documents to prevent novel diagnostics and therapeutics
from lagging behind the urgent needs of the population. In this paper, we propose adapting
yet another tool that the FDA has already been exploring for medical devices (Chaudhuri et
al. 2018, 2019) to therapeutics for treating COVID-19 that are currently under development.
In recent years, Bayesian adaptive RCT protocols have been increasingly used to expedite
the clinical trial process of potentially transformative therapies for diseases with high
mortality rates (Berry, 2015). Currently, these protocols have mainly been applied within
the oncology domain, such as I-SPY for breast cancer (Barker et al., 2009) and GBM AGILE
for glioblastoma (Alexander et al. 2018). These studies use Bayesian inference algorithms to
greatly reduce the number of patients needed to assess the therapeutic effects of a drug
candidate, without lowering the statistical power of the final approval decision, as measured
by Type I and II error rates. As a result, therapeutic candidates can progress more quickly
through the regulatory process and reach patients faster and at lower cost.
For severe diseases with no curative treatments, such as pancreatic cancer, patients tend to
tolerate a higher Type I error of accepting an ineffective therapy in exchange for a lower Type
II error of rejecting an effective therapy as well as expedited approvals of potentially
effective treatments. Based on this observation, a patient-centered Bayesian protocol was
proposed (Isakov et al., 2018; Montazerhodjat et al., 2017) that incorporates patient values
into clinical trial design and identify the optimal balance between the possibilities of false
positives (Type I error) and false negatives (Type II error). For more severe diseases, this
protocol sets a tolerated Type I error rate much larger than the traditional 5% threshold,
which leads to higher rates of approvals and expedited approval decisions.
However, the original Bayesian adaptive RCT framework does not take into account patient
risk preferences. To address this gap, Chaudhuri and Lo (2018) developed an adaptive
version of the Bayesian patient-centered model that achieves an optimal balance between
Type I and Type II error rates, significantly reducing the number of subjects needed in trials
to achieve a statistically significant conclusion. A key feature of this model is the time
evolution of the loss function of the Bayesian decision algorithm. This mechanism favors the
expedited approval of diagnostic or therapeutic candidates that show early positive effects,
since patients place a lower value on delayed approval of an effective diagnostic or therapy.
There is a natural but subtle analog to this dilemma in the case of therapeutics for an
infectious disease during the course of an epidemic outbreak. Approving an effective
therapeutic early will prevent future infections and deaths, while approving it later will save
fewer people from infection. On the other hand, approving an ineffective therapeutic early

will not prevent any future casualties. Worse still, it may prevent people from taking
adequate precautions against infection, since they will falsely believe that they are safe from
the disease after the advent of the ineffective therapy.
Moreover, the cost of Type I versus Type II error can differ from therapy to therapy. A novel
vaccine that could trigger a significant immune response such as a cytokine storm has a much
higher cost of a Type I error than a medical device such as an air filtration system designed
to destroy virions through intense ultraviolet light. Therefore, the appropriate statistical
threshold for approval should depend on the specific therapy, as well as the circumstances
of the current burden of disease.
In this article, we apply the Bayesian adaptive protocol to anti-infective therapeutic
development using a loss function that evolves over the course of an epidemic outbreak. We
achieve an optimal balance between Type I and Type II errors for therapeutics that treat
infectious diseases and identify the optimal time to reach the approval decision based on the
accumulation of clinical evidence. Our results show that when the epidemic is more
infectious, the necessary sample size of the RCT decreases, while the tolerable Type I error
increases. This confirms our earlier intuition that potentially effective therapies that are
known to be safe should receive expedited approval when an epidemic is spreading rapidly.

2 Multi‚ÄêGroup SEIR Epidemic Model
The starting point for our analysis is the Susceptible-Exposure-Infective-Removed (SEIR)
epidemic model, which has been applied to model the outbreak of COVID-19 in China in a
number of recent studies (Yang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020). The population of N subjects is
partitioned into four distinct groups: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and
removed (R). The time evolution of the epidemic is specified by the following group of
ordinary differential equations:
ùëëùëÜ
ùëëùë°

ùõΩùëÜùêº,

ùëëùê∏
ùëëùë°

ùõΩùëÜùêº

ùëéùê∏,

ùëëùêº
ùëëùë°

ùëéùê∏

ùõæùêº,

ùëëùëÖ
ùëëùë°

ùõæùêº .

(1)

Here we use the convention that ùëÜ ùë° , ùê∏ ùë° , ùêº ùë° , and ùëÖ ùë° are the proportions of the
susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed populations, respectively, satisfying the
conservation constraint for all ùë°:
ùëÜ ùë°

ùê∏ ùë°

ùêº ùë°

ùëÖ ùë°

100% .

(2)

The parameters ùõΩ, ùëé, and ùõæ denote the average rates of infection, incubation and recovery,
respectively, and ùúá ‚àà 0%, 100% denotes the mortality rate of the epidemic. For example,
if ùúá 5%, we expect 5% of infected subjects will die from the disease. At time ùë°, ùúáùëÖ ùë° ùëÅ
subjects will have died, and 1 ùúá ùëÖ ùë° ùëÅ will have recovered.
A critical measure of the infectivity of an epidemic is its basic reproduction number, defined
as ùëÖ
ùõΩ/ùõæ in the SEIR model. This is the expected number of secondary infections caused
by each infected subject in a population with no public health measures (such as quarantine,
social-distancing, or vaccination).

A number of studies have used different statistical schemes to estimate ùëÖ for COVID-19
during its initial outbreak period in central China in January 2020. These estimated values of
ùëÖ range from 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) (Li et al., 2020) to 3.58 (95% CI, 2.89 to 4.39) (Zhao et
al., 2020). Given the large uncertainty in the value of ùëÖ , we simulate therapeutic
development under scenarios with constant ùëÖ values of 2 and 4.
In addition, to model the impact of governmental nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
on containing the spread of the epidemic, we consider a dynamic transmission SEIR model
where the infection rate ùõΩ ùë° monotonically decreases in time as a result of the NPI.
Specifically, we assume that ùõΩ ùë° takes the sigmoid functional form:

ùõΩ ùë°

ùõΩ
1

ùõΩ‚àû
ùë° ùë°
exp
ùúè

ùõΩ‚àû .

(3)

Here ùõΩ and ùõΩ denote the infection rates in the initial and final stages of the epidemic (with
ùõΩ ), respectively, ùë° denotes the half-life of the decay in infection rate, and ùúè the length of
ùõΩ
ùõΩ corresponds to more
the time window when this decay occurred. A larger difference ùõΩ
significant reduction of epidemic transmission, a smaller value of ùë° corresponds to a speedier
decision to enforce the NPI, and a smaller value of ùúè corresponds to more strict enforcement of
3 and ùõΩ
1.5 based on
the NPI since ùõΩ ùë° decays more rapidly. We calibrate the values ùõΩ
the estimates of the dynamic transmission rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China from December
2019 to February 2020 (Kucharski et al., 2020). We consider different values of ùë° and ùúè to reflect
the variability in timing and stringency of NPIs enforced by governments around the globe.
To model the significant variability in mortality rates of COVID-19 for patients in different
age groups, we extend this basic model to a multi-group SEIR model, where the population
is partitioned into five age groups, (1) below 49, (2) 50 to 59, (3) 60 to 69, (4) 70 to 79, and
(5) above 80. We use ùëÜ , ùê∏ , ùêº , and ùëÖ to denote the corresponding type in each group (and
continue to use ùëÜ, ùê∏, ùêº, and ùëÖ for the total proportion of each type in all groups). The
dynamics of the epidemic are specified by the modified ordinary differential equations:
ùëëùëÜ
ùëëùë°

ùõæùêº

ùëëùëÖ
ùëëùë°

ùõæùêº

(4)

Here ùëê denotes the contact rate of the susceptible subjects in the ùëñ th age group with the total
infected population ùêº of all groups. This contact rate is measured relative to group 1, which
we normalize to ùëê
1. In the case of COVID-19, although the mortality rate is much higher
for senior populations (Onder et al., 2020), the elderly also tends to have less frequent
contact with the infected population outside the household (Walker et al., 2020).
We solve the differential equations in the multi-group SEIR model using the ODE45 solver in
MATLAB 2019a with initial conditions for each age group:

The parameter ùêº denotes the proportion of the initially infected population, ùëü is the ratio of
initially exposed and infected subjects, and ùëÉ is the percentage of the ùëñ th age group in the
population. The assumed demographic, contact rate, and mortality rate values are
summarized in Table 2.

3 A Bayesian Patient‚ÄêCentered Approval Process
Similar to Chaudhuri and Lo (2018), we develop a Bayesian patient-centered decision model
for RCT approval which minimizes the expected loss (or harm) incurred on the patients by
optimally balancing the losses of Type I and Type II errors. Here the loss does not refer to
financial costs afforded by the patients, but rather the loss in patient value (i.e. how much
patients weigh the relative harms of infection and death). We assign the losses per patient of
being susceptible, infected, and deceased. Since Bayesian decision thresholds are invariant
under the rescaling of the losses, we normalize by setting the loss per patient infection ùêø
1 . We then assign the loss per patient death relative to ùêø as ùêø , and the loss due to
susceptibility to the disease as ùêø . The parameter values we assume, summarized in Table
1, are meant to represent one reasonable valuation of the relative losses. However, in
practice patient value will differ from one patient group another, especially given the large
variability of mortality rate of COVID-19 in different age groups (Onder et al., 2020). Here
we report the main results of optimal sample size and statistical significance (Table 3 and 4)
assuming ùêø
100. The results for ùêø
10 are provided in Supplementary Materials.
We simulate the multi-group SEIR model over a time period of ùëá weeks, where ùëá is the
duration of the epidemic outbreak. Let ùúÖ denote the weekly subject enrollment rate in each
arm of the clinical trial. We assume that the value of ùëÖ is known (or well-estimated) at initial
time ùë° 0 and stays constant during the course of the outbreak. At time ùë° ‚àà 0, ùëá , the
Bayesian loss C t of choosing the action ùêª ùëñ under ùêª ùëó is defined as:
ùêª

By design, this loss function penalizes Type I errors early in the epidemic by the susceptible

at an earlier time will expose more currently susceptible population to the epidemic, since
they will falsely believe that they are safe from the disease after the advent of the ineffective
therapeutic. On the other hand, the loss function also penalizes correct approval decisions
made at later stages of an epidemic via to the cumulative infected and death terms, ùê∂ùêº ùë° and
ùúáùëÖ ùë° . A correct but delayed approval decision for the therapeutic is less valuable since it
will save fewer susceptible people from infection and death.
The Bayesian decision model considers the null hypothesis ùêª 0 that the anti-infective
therapeutic (or vaccine) has no clinical effect, against the alternative hypothesis that it has
positive clinical effect with signal-to-noise ratio ùúå (Chaudhuri and Lo, 2018). We use ùëù and
ùëù to denote the Bayesian prior probabilities of ùêª 0 and ùêª 1, respectively.
This patient-value model imposes higher losses for incorrect approvals at earlier stages and
correct approvals at later stages of an epidemic. Under these constraints, the Bayesian
decision algorithm yields the sample size and statistical significance threshold of the RCT
that optimally balances Type I and Type II error.

4 Results
We simulate an epidemic outbreak over a time period of ùëá weeks, where ùëá is the duration of
the outbreak. For an epidemic with higher infectivity, its duration is shorter, which puts
more pressure to reach a timely approval decision. To avoid numerical instability, we
formally define ùëá as the first time when the number of cumulative infected patients reaches
99.9% of total infections predicted by the SEIR model. We assume an age-specific mortality
rate ùúá at the level of COVID-19 (Onder et al. 2020; World Health Organization, 2020), and
incubation and recovery periods of 7 days each (Yang et al. 2020). These estimated
parameters can all be challenged to varying degrees, depending on the specific drugindication pair under consideration and the particular circumstances of the epidemic, but
they are meant to be representative for a typical anti-infective therapeutic during the midst
of a growing epidemic.
We also assume that it takes 7 days after injection to assess the efficacy of the therapeutic on
each subject. We adopt the optimization scheme of Montazerhodjat et al. (2017) to find the
optimal Type I and Type II error rates of the non-adaptive Bayesian RCT. To represent typical
practice of the pharmaceutical industry, we optimize under the upper bound on the model‚Äôs
power Power
90% (Isakov et al. 2019). We then use these optimal error rates as our
stopping criteria to simulate the sequential decision process of a Bayesian adaptive RCT via
Monte Carlo simulation (Chaudhuri and Lo, 2018). The simulation results are summarized
in Table 3.
We separate the results into two distinct types of therapeutics‚Äînon-vaccine anti-infectives
and vaccines‚Äîbecause of the differences in their historical probabilities of success. Vaccine
development programs have an estimated PoS of 40% as of 2019Q4
(https://projectalpha.mit.edu) whereas the corresponding figure for non-vaccine antiinfectives is 23% (Wong et al., 2020).

4.1 Non‚ÄêVaccine Anti‚ÄêInfective Therapeutics
Static Transmission Rate
We first analyze the case when the infectivity ùëÖ remains constant in time (e.g. in the absence
of effective NPIs). For the fixed-sample Bayesian RCT on a non-vaccine anti-infective
therapeutic, as ùëÖ increases from 2 to 4 (Rows 1 to 2 of Table 3), the optimal sample size of
each experimental arm decreases from 242 to 152 and the optimal Type I error rate
drastically increases from 7.1% to 17.3% (Figure 1), much higher than the traditional 5%
threshold. As the epidemic spreads across the population more rapidly, the Bayesian RCT
model has greater pressure to expedite the approval process and a much higher tolerance of
false positive outcomes.
For the Bayesian adaptive RCT, when the therapeutic is ineffective (ùêª 0), the average
sample size required to reject the therapeutic is much smaller than that of the non-adaptive
version (Columns 7 and 8 of Table 3). Also, the required sample size decreases with the
infectivity ùëÖ in both mean and quartiles, yet always achieves Type I error rate ùõº below that
of the non-adaptive version (Column 11). The adaptive Bayesian decision model is able to
reject an ineffective therapeutic with a relatively small sample size and a bounded falsepositive rate.
On the other hand, when the therapeutic is effective (ùêª 1), as ùëÖ increases from 2 to 4, the
average sample size required by the Bayesian adaptive RCT decreases from 148 to 78
(Columns 9 and 10 of Table 3). The Bayesian adaptive model places more weight on
approving an effective therapeutic earlier to prevent future infections when the epidemic is
more infectious. Despite the smaller sample size, the model still retains an empirical power
above 91.0% for all values of ùëÖ (Column 12). The Bayesian adaptive model simultaneously
expedites the approval of an effective therapeutic and retains a bounded false-negative rate.
The results are illustrated in Figure 2.
Furthermore, as the proportion of the initially infected population ùêº decreases from 0.1% to
0.01% (Rows 4 to 6 of Table 3), the optimal sample sizes for non-adaptive and adaptive RCTs
both increase, while the optimal Type I error rates decrease. Beginning the clinical trials for
a therapeutic during the earlier stages of an epidemic outbreak reduces the need to expedite
the approval process in order to contain its future spread. Clinicians and researchers have
more time to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic and record adverse effects by testing it on
a larger number of subjects, which leads to a lower Type I error rate.
Finally, when the mortality rate ùúá increases from the level of COVID-19 (Onder et al. 2020;
World Health Organization, 2020), to the level of SARS (World Health Organization, 2003),
and further to the level MERS (World Health Organization, 2019), the optimal sample sizes
for both non-adaptive and adaptive Bayesian models decrease and the optimal Type I error
rates increase (Rows 7 to 12 of Table 3). When the epidemic is more lethal, the Bayesian
adaptive model requires fewer subjects in the RCT, since both Type I and Type II errors will
lead to greater losses due to death by infection. The higher death tolls provides significantly
more incentive in the Bayesian adaptive framework to approve the therapeutic in the hopes
of saving more people from future infection and death.

One interesting feature of the Bayesian decision model is that the optimal Type I error rate
is not a monotonic function ùëÖ , but rather has a global minimum of 8% at ùëÖ
1.7 for
COVID-19, as shown in Figure 1. As ùëÖ decreases below 1.7, the optimal Type I error rate
increases. The intuition for this result that we define the loss of Type I error as the excess
risk of being susceptible to infection ùëÜ ùë°
ùëÜ ùëá ùëÅùêø , where ùëÜ ùëá is the fraction of the
population that remains uninfected throughout the epidemic outbreak. When ùëÖ is small,
ùëÜ ùëá is close to 100% and the excess risk ùëÜ ùë°
ùëÜ ùëá ùëÅùêø is small compared to the benefit
of preventing future deaths. Therefore, when the epidemic is not very infectious, the
Bayesian decision model expedites the approval decision. This also confirms the intuition
that smaller sample sizes are required in adaptive trials for diseases that affect a small
fraction of the population. If we instead define the loss of Type I error as the absolute risk of
being susceptible ùëÜ ùë° ùëÅùêø , we find that the optimal Type I error indeed monotonically
increases with ùëÖ , as shown in Figure 11 of Supplementary Materials.
Dynamic Transmission Rate
The results for the dynamic transmission model with ùõΩ
3, ùõΩ
1.5, ùë°
3 weeks and ùúè
1 week are summarized in Table 3. For COVID-19 (rows 3 and 6), we find that the Bayesian
optimal sample size and Type I error rate of the dynamic transmission model lie in between
the scenarios ùëÖ
2 and ùëÖ
4. This suggests that timely and effective government
interventions will protect more subjects from infection and allow more time for the RCT.
However, for the more fatal SARS and MERS (rows 9 and 12), the dynamic transmission
model sets higher optimal Type I error ùõº and smaller sample size than ùëÖ
4. This is due to
the U-shaped curve of optimal ùõº vs. ùëÖ , shown in Figure 1. When the NPI reduces ùëÖ ùë°
below a certain threshold, the optimal ùõº starts to increase. For highly fatal epidemics, when
the government adopts NPIs to protect most of the susceptible population from infection,
the regulatory priority should be to expedite potentially effective treatments that can help
current patients since the loss of Type I error is much lower than that of the Type II error.
In addition, we investigate the impact of the timing and stringency of NPIs enforced by the
government with different values of ùë° and ùúè. The results are summarized in Table 5. We find
that the optimal Type I error is larger for ùë°
3 weeks than ùë°
6 weeks. Therefore, if the
government adopts well-enforced NPIs early on (such as the lockdown of Wuhan, China) to
protect the susceptible population, this will reduce the loss associated with Type I error,
leading to expedited approvals of potentially effective therapeutics. Furthermore, the sooner
an effective therapeutic is approved, the sooner will NPIs be lifted.
4.2 Vaccines
We repeat the above analysis for RCT of vaccines using a prior probability of having an
40% as reported at https://projectalpha.mit.edu for 2019Q4. The
effective vaccine ùëù
simulation results are summarized in Table 4. Overall, we observe the same pattern in the
optimal sample size and Type I error rates on infectivity, mortality, and proportion of initial
infections. However, since ùëù is higher for vaccines, the Bayesian decision model requires
fewer subjects on average in the RCT to ascertain the positive effects of the vaccine,
compared to the case of anti-infective therapeutics in Table 3. We find that vaccines should
receive even more expedited evaluation.

parameters, we perform a sensitivity analysis on the parameter values. The results are
summarized in Supplementary Materials.

5 Discussion
A natural consequence of using a patient-centered framework for determining the approval
threshold is, of course, more false positives‚Äîand the potential for a greater number of
patients with adverse side-effects‚Äîin cases where the burden of disease is high. These false
positives can be addressed through more vigilant post-approval surveillance by regulatory
agencies and greater requirements for drug and device companies to provide such patientlevel data to the regulator following approval. Failure to provide such data or evidence of an
ineffective therapy can be grounds for revoking the approval.
However, past experience shows that withdrawing an approved drug can be challenging and
disruptive for several reasons (Onakpoya, Heneghan, and Aronson, 2016). Therefore,
implementing the patient-centered approach may require creating a new category of
temporary approvals for crisis situations involving urgent needs at national or international
levels, similar to the FDA‚Äôs EUA program. Such a program might involve provisional approval
of a candidate therapy consisting of a one- or two-year license‚Äîdepending on the nature of
the drug-indication pair‚Äîto market the therapy to a pre-specified patient population, no offlabel use of the therapy, and regular monitoring and data reporting to the regulator by the
manufacturer and/or patients‚Äô physicians during the licensing period (Lo, 2017). At the end
of this trial period, one of two outcomes would occur, depending on the accumulated data
during this period: (a) the ‚Äúurgent needs‚Äù license expires; or (b) the license converts to the
traditional regulatory license. Of course, at any point during the trial period, the regulator
can terminate the license if the data show that the therapeutic is ineffective and/or unsafe.
While such a process may impose greater burdens on patients, manufacturers, and
regulators, it may still be worthwhile if it brings faster or greater relief to patients facing
mortal illnesses and extreme suffering. In this respect, an urgent-needs program may be
viewed as a middle ground between a standard clinical trial and an approval, similar in spirit
to the adaptive designs of sophisticated clinical trials with master protocols such as I-SPY 2,
LUNG-MAP, and GBM-AGILE, in which patient care and clinical investigations are
simultaneously accomplished. Also, because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) has demonstrated a willingness to cover the cost of certain therapeutics for which
evidence is still being generated (see, for example, CMS‚Äôs ‚Äúcoverage with evidence‚Äù programs
listed at https://go.cms.gov/2v6ZxWm), additional economic incentives may be available to
support such temporary licenses.

6 Conclusion
We apply the Bayesian adaptive patient-centered model of Chaudhuri and Lo (2018) to
clinical trials for therapeutics that treat infectious diseases during an epidemic outbreak.
Using a simple epidemiological model, we find that the optimal sample size in the clinical
trial decreases with the infectivity of the epidemic, measured by the basic reproduction
number ùëÖ . At the same time, the optimal Type I error rate increases with ùëÖ . Lower levels
of initial infection increase the number of subjects required to verify the therapeutic efficacy
of the therapeutic under investigation, while higher levels of mortality increase the optimal
sample size. The results confirm our intuition that clinical trials should be expedited and a
higher false positive rate should be tolerated when the epidemic spreads more rapidly
through the population, has a higher mortality rate, and has already infected a sizable
portion of the population at the beginning of the RCT.
To provide transparency for how a patient-centered approach differs from the traditional
statistical framework in the anti-infectives context, we used a relatively simple mathematical
model of epidemic disease dynamics to estimate the societal loss in an outbreak. More
sophisticated epidemiological models can easily be incorporated into our framework at the
cost of computational tractability and transparency.
One interesting trade-off to be explored is the difference between COVID-19 vaccine and an
anti-viral treatment that can cure an infected patient. While prevention through vaccination
is the ultimate solution, a successful treatment for the disease using repurposed drugs that
have already been approved for other indications (and whose safety profile has already been
established) may be even more valuable, especially if it can be deployed in the nearer term
and reduce the growing fear and panic among the general population. In such cases, the
approval threshold should clearly reflect these cost/benefit differences.
Of course, in practice regulators consider many factors beyond p-values in making its
decisions. However, that process is opaque even to industry insiders, and the role of patient
preferences is unclear. The proposed patient-centered approach provides a systematic,
objective, adaptive, and repeatable framework for explicitly incorporating patient
preferences and burden-of-disease data in the therapeutic approval process. This
framework also fulfills two mandates for the FDA, one from the fifth authorization of the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for an enhanced quantitative approach to the
benefit-risk assessment of new drugs (U.S FDA, 2013), and the other from Section 3002 of
the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 requiring the FDA to develop guidelines for patientfocused drug development, which includes collecting patient preference and experience data
and explicitly incorporating this information in the drug approval process.
We hope this work will shed further insight into improving the current clinical trial process
for infectious disease therapeutics and contribute to the timely development of effective
treatments for COVID-19 patients in particular.

Figure 13. Optimal Type I error rate ùú∂ of non‚Äêadaptive Bayesian RCT monotonically
increases with the basic reproduction number ùëπùüé (assuming ùë∞ùüé ùüé. ùüè%, ùë≥ùë´ ùüèùüéùüé and
disease mortality of COVID‚Äê19) if we define the loss of making a Type I error as the
absolute risk of being susceptible ùë∫ ùíï ùëµùë≥ùë∫ .
This alternative definition is not very realistic. For an epidemic with ùëπùüé ùüê, the loss
of Type I error converges to a large positive value ùë∫ ùëª ùëµùë≥ùë∫ as time approaches the end
of the epidemic outbreak. However, at the end of the outbreak, there are no more
infected patients and thus no susceptible subjects. Therefore, the loss of Type I error
should approach zero as ùíï ‚Üí ùëª. This is the case for the excess risk of susceptibility
ùë∫ ùíï
ùë∫ ùëª ùëµùë≥ùë∫ but not for the absolute risk of susceptibility ùë∫ ùíï ùëµùë≥ùë∫ .
