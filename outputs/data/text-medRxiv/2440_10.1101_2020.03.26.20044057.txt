Introduction: Recently, a new strain of coronaviruses, which originated from Wuhan City, Hubei
Province, China has been identified. According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further
investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential. Hence, we
carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features.
Methods: This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed.
We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological,
and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19. We used STATA v.11 and random
effect model for data analysis.
Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied.
The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%),
respectively. The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia
(61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%). The
study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically
severe patients. Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent.
Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings
or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA
sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is
no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border
crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue.

Introduction
Coronavirus is a type of enveloped RNA virus with size of 60 to 140 nanometers in diameter. They
have spike-like projections with a crown-like appearance under the electron microscope (1). This
family of viruses, which can be divided into four type of alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, can infect
multiple types of different species. For instance, they have been isolated from humans (alpha and
beta), bats, Canidae, and Felidae (2, 3). Although the coronavirus family is mainly responsible for
human mild respiratory diseases such as common cold, in some cases, they can cause serious
illnesses (3). Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) are among epidemic diseases caused by coronaviruses in recent decades (4).
Recently, a novel strain of coronaviruses, which originated from Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
China, has been identified (1). This strain (SARS-CoV-2) has been discovered in 2019 and
characterized as a pandemic disease in March 2020 (5). According to World Health Organization
(WHO), up to 17 March 2020, over 188,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported
throughout the world with the mortality rate of 3.4 % (6).
In a study, Sun et al. assessed the incidence of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and ARDS in patients
with CoVID-19 (7). Given the increasing prevalence of the disease, further investigation of the
clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems necessary. In this regard, we conducted this
systematic and meta-analysis review. In this study, we investigated the risk of incidence of
different type of clinical finding and comorbidities in severe and non-severe patients.

Material and Methods
Source information
This systematic review and meta-analysis has been carried out on cross-sectional and case-series
studies. We searched databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed without any time
limitation for publications up to March 13, 2020. As manual search, the list of imported references,
list of related reviews, and the results of Google Scholar have been investigated.
Search strategy
All processes of searching, screening and reporting were done according to Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We used following
keywords in our systematic search in order to find English papers: “2019 novel coronavirus
infection”, COVID19, “coronavirus disease 2019”, “coronavirus disease-19”, “2019-nCoV
disease”, “2019 novel coronavirus disease”, and “2019-nCoV infection.”; all in title/abstract field.
Eligibility Criteria
We considered following criteria for study selection:


The study should have an observatory approach investigated COVID-19 patients.



Studies on a particular group of people (e.g. pregnant women) has been excluded.



Studies included with desired variables such as symptoms, comorbidity, laboratory
findings, etc.



Studies should be in English. English abstracts of other language studies were investigated
for eligible data.



All the case report and animal studies were excluded.

Study Selection
Duplicated papers were deleted using EndNote software. Two researchers screened the remaining
papers according to the criteria, separately. In case of disagreement between the two investigators,
a third person was making the final decision.
Quality assessment
For the quality assessment, a modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment (NOS)
have been used. The investigated papers categorized into two categories. The studies with a score
of 1 or 2 as poor quality, and studies with a score of 3 to 5 as high quality.
Data Extraction
Data such as authors information, publication year, sample size, average/median age, death rate,
hospitalization status, early symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological findings and underlying
diseases of patients have been extracted and recorded.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v.11 software. The heterogeneity of studies has
been investigated using I-square (I2) test. Based on the results, for I2 more than 50%, we used a
random-effects model to pool the results. Moreover, to study the heterogeneity of the added study,
subgroup analysis in severe and non-severe patients have been done.

Results
Study Selection Process
The search in databases yields 351 results. After excluding duplicated papers, 364 results were
admitted to the screening step. Then, 65 papers have been selected for full-text analysis. Finally,
19 studies were entered into the meta-analysis. Additionally, 13 studies obtained from manual
search were included in the meta-analysis. The PRISMA flow diagram for the study selection
process presented in Figure 1.
Study Characteristics
Out of selected papers, a total of 49504 patients infected with CoVID-19 with age ranged between
40 to 58 years old were included in our investigation. All of the papers were conducted in China
and only one study was a collaboration between China and South Korea. Characteristics of studies
entered into meta-analysis are presented in Table 1.
Quality Assessment
According to quality assessment using NOS tool, all of the studies categorized as high quality. The
quality assessment graph is presented in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1.
Characteristics of Patients
Regarding hospitalization, our findings showed that 69% of the patients need to be hospitalized.
About 26% of patients were discharged after receiving outpatient treatment and only 3% of
patients have been expired (Fig. 3).

Many studies have investigated the laboratory findings of the patients. Most common observing
in these patients were leukocytopenia (26%, 95%CI 17 – 35), neutrophilia (25%, 95%CI 11 – 39),
thrombocytopenia (36%, 95%CI 30- 42) and lymphocytopenia (34%, 95%CI 12 – 57) by following
thrombocytosis (4%, 95%CI 1 – 8), increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (56%, 95%CI 21 – 92),
procalcitonin (5%, 95%CI 1 – 8), IL-6 (42%, 95%CI 34 – 50), D-dimer (14%, 95%CI 0 – 28), and
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (54%, 95%CI 28 – 79) (Fig. 7 and 8).
Radiological Findings
Regarding radiological findings, 84% (95%CI 79 – 88) of patients who underwent a Computed
tomography (CT) scan were positive for pneumonia. The most common radiological findings in
these patients were Ground-glass opacity (50%, 95%CI 29 – 70), consolidation (27%, 95%CI 10
– 44), unilateral pneumonia (24%, 95%CI 3 – 44), and bilateral pneumonia (61%, 95%CI 30 – 91)
(Supplementary File and Table 2).
Comorbidities
Different studies investigated the underlying diseases in patients with COVID-19. The
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease were reported in 12, 11, and 4
original studies, respectively. In this regard, pooling of the results was 10% (95%CI 7 – 114), 10%
(95%CI 7 – 14), and 2% (95%CI 1 – 3), respectively. Also, other underlying diseases like
hypertension and chronic kidney disease were investigated in 11 and 7 studies. The general
outbreak of these disorders was 18% (95%CI 13 – 23) and 1% (95%CI 1 – 2) respectively
(Supplementary File and Table 2).

Other disorders prevalence was as follows: digestive tract (5%, 95%CI 1 – 10), chronic liver
disease (2%, 95%CI 1 – 4), endocrine disease (6%, 95%CI -1 – 13), malignancies (2%, 95%CI 1
– 3), central nervous system (2%, 95%CI 1 – 4), respiratory system (2%, 95% 1 – 3) and
immunodeficiency (0%) (Supplementary File and Table 2).
The acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury after infecting with COVID-19
have been investigated in 4 and 3 studies, respectively. Meta-analysis showed the prevalence of
21% (95%CI 6 – 35) and 2% (95%CI -1-5) respectively (Supplementary File and Table 2).
Comorbidities and clinical findings based on severity of disease
In this systematic review for detecting the source of heterogeneity, we analyzed the subgroups
based on the severity of the disease. The results are as follows:
The prevalence of the symptoms such as sore throat, sputum production, headache, and fatigue in
stable patients did not need to be admitted into intensive care unit (ICU) were 14%, 33%, 14%,
44%, respectively. However, these statistics for patients with severe symptoms were 14%, 41%,
12%, 53%. Other symptoms like diarrhea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, and dyspnea in mild patients
showed the prevalence of 9%, 17%, 6%, and 24%, which were 8%, 30%, 9%, and 59%,
respectively in severe cases (Supplementary File and Table 2).
The prevalence of symptoms like abdominal pain, pharyngalgia, hemoptysis, expectoration, and
fever in mild cases were 6%, 8%, 1%, 36%, 90%. The same symptoms for the severe cases were
7%, 14%, 3%, 39%, 94% respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence of the symptoms of myalgia,
cough, dizziness, chills, and shortness of breath were 27%, 68%, 5%, 11%, and 19% whereas in

severe cases were 21%, 75%, 12%, 16%, and 39%, respectively (Supplementary File and Table
2).
The meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of the underlying diseases like cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease and hypertension in COVID-19 patients were 4%, 6%,
1%, 14%, respectively. However, in critically severe patients were 15%, 17%, 10%, and 31%. The
prevalence of other underlying diseases like chronic liver disease and respiratory diseases were
2% and 1% whereas in severe cases, respiratory diseases prevalence is 6% (Supplementary File
and Table 2).
The prevalence of malignancies (2%) and chronic kidney disease (1%) mostly reported in mild
patients whereas in severe cases, were 2% and 24%, respectively (Supplementary File and Table
2).

Discussion
Due to the novelty of Coronavirus 2019, there is no clear picture of the clinical and paraclinical
features of the disease. Moreover, the reported frequencies of these features are variable.
Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed to evaluate the clinical
and paraclinical features of the disease. In this systematic review, 20 studies including 48967 cases
of COVID-19 have been studied. All the studies were conducted in China, with one exception
which studies some case in South Korea along with Chinese cases.
It was difficult to diagnose this disease at the time of onset, as the general symptoms of the disease
can also be seen in other respiratory diseases. A wide range of clinical, laboratory, and imaging
findings have been observed in relation to this disease. Symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue,

and sputum were common clinical symptoms in this study, but cases such as diarrhea, chest pain
and nausea were less common. As mentioned, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and
nausea are less common and symptoms such as fever and cough are more common in viral
infections such as seasonal influenza, SARS and MERS. (8, 9). Many patients with coronavirus
may be unrecognized and present in the community because, according to the results of this study,
none of the clinical symptoms were definitively present in all patients. Therefore, definitive
diagnosis of patients is difficult and one should expect hidden and vector-borne patients in the
community. In the meta-analysis of Sun et al. which conducted on the symptoms of COVID-19
patients, the results have shown that fever, cough, and fatigue are among the most common
symptoms (7).
The rate of death and the outcome of patients after hospitalization have been investigated in this
meta-analysis. The results have shown more than two-thirds of the patients (69%) who referred to
the hospitals get hospitalized, and about 26% will be released after outpatient treatment. Around
3% of the patients, however, will expire. It should be noted that the real mortality rate would be
higher than this statistics. In the study of Baud et al. It has been shown that the mortality of this
disease is higher than that typically obtained by dividing the death rate by the total number of
patients. Because at the time of infection the number of persons is much lower than the number
entered into the denominator (10). Based on the present meta-analysis findings in 84% of suspected
cases, CT-Scan findings were positive, indicating that a high proportion of patients can be
identified by relying on CT-Scan.
On the other hand, 84% of suspected cases had high fever and cough was seen in many patients.
Changes in laboratory findings are less common than radiological and clinical findings and appear
to be less reliable. According to the study in the group of patients with severe conditions and
11

outpatients, it was found that the symptoms associated with the disease are more common in
critically ill patients at the time of diagnosis and treatment. Also, underlying diseases were more
common in these patients.
The limitations of this study include:
1. All of the studies have been conducted in China
2. High methodological heterogeneity in the included studies
3. Due to the lack of information by sex and age, it was not possible to calculate the mortality
and morbidity of patients in these subgroups.
Conclusion
Given the high proportion that may occur without CT-Scan findings or clinical symptoms, it is
advisable to use several combination methods to better diagnose the disease, to minimize
undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in
in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such
as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue. Since the prevalence of underlying diseases is higher in
patients with more severe conditions, the risk of serious illness in those with underlying diseases
should be considered.
