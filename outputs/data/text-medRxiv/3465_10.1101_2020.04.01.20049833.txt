ABSTRACT
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an unprecedented
global public health challenge, leading to thousands of deaths every day worldwide.
Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19
remain unclear.The aim of this study was todescribe the clinical, laboratorial and
radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19.
Methods: The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and April 6th
2020. No language restrictions were applied. Inclusion criteria were: (1) studied patients
younger than 18 years old; (2) presented original data from cases of COVID-19
confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (3) contained
descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests or radiological examinations.
Results: A total of 38 studies (1,124 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1,117 had
their severity classified: 14.2% were asymptomatic, 36.3% were mild, 46.0% were
moderate, 2.1% were severe and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was
fever (47.5%), followed by cough (41.5%), nasal symptoms (11.2%), diarrhea (8.1%)
and nausea/vomiting (7.1%). One hundred forty-five (36.9%) children were diagnosed
with pneumonia and 43 (10.9%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced
lymphocyte count were reported in 12.9% of cases. Abnormalities on computed
tomography was reported in 63.0% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported
were ground glass opacities, patchy shadows and consolidations. Only one death was
reported.
Conclusions: Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from
adults cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should not be considered a hallmark of
COVID-19 in children.

INTRODUCTION
In late December 2019, Chinese authorities informed the World Health
Organization (WHO) that, due to unknown cause, an outbreak of pneumonia emerged in
Wuhan, Hubei province. On January 7, 2020, a new type of coronavirus (severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) was isolated and few days after the
disease has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”). The
first death caused by COVID-19 was on January 9, 2020, in Wuhan and since then more
than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths occurred worldwide.1 Nowadays, the death toll in
Italy has exceeded four timese the number registered in China and the United States
became the new COVID-19 epicenter.
In spite of stepped-up efforts to contain the pandemic, the number of affected
patients and the death toll continue to rise. Elderly patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
are at high risk to have severe acute respiratory syndrome, complications and death.2
Due to unknown reasons, children with COVID-19 appear to have a milder clinical
course compared to adults, and reports of death are scarce.3,4 However, pediatric
population may play a major role in community spread of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to
viral shedding in nasal secretions, there is evidence of fecal shedding for several weeks
after diagnosis, which poses a challenge for infection control.5
Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with
COVID-19 remain unclear. The WHO recommends testing all suspected cases,
however, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may not meet all the criteria required in

the suspected case definition.6 The objective of this study is to describe the clinical,
laboratorial and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19 reported in the
literature.

METHODS
This review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.7,8 The Medline database was
searched using the following search strategy: ((((covid-19) OR coronavirus) OR SARSCoV-2)) AND (((((((pediatrics) OR children) OR neonates) OR child) OR neonate) OR
infant) OR infants). No language restrictions were applied. Articles published between
December 1st 2019 and April 7th 2020 were evaluated for inclusion. No attempts were
made to contact the study authors for identifying missing and confusing data. A manual
search of the references found in the selected articles and reviews was also performed.

Study Selection
Two authors (THS and JAN) screened the titles and abstracts independently and
in duplicate for potential eligibility. They subsequently read the full texts to determine
final eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus, and if
necessary, the assistance of a third author (MBB) was sought.
Eligible studies fulfilled the following criteria: (1) studied patients younger than
18 years old; (2) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction; (3) contained descriptions of clinical
manifestations, laboratory tests or radiological examinations.

Data Extraction

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049833; this version posted April 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

A structured data extraction form was piloted and then used to extract data from
the reports of all included studies in duplicate and independently by two authors (THS
and JAN). Discrepancies in extracted data were resolved through discussion. The
following data were extracted, when available, from each elected article: first author,
publication year, study design, number of cases, gender, age, clinical manifestations,
laboratory tests, radiological examinations and outcomes (discharged, still hospitalized
or death).
When sufficient data was reported, the cases were classified into the following
clinical types:9
1. Asymptomatic infection: without any clinical symptoms and signs and the
chest imaging is normal, while the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was
positive or the serum-specific antibody was retrospectively diagnosed as
infection.
2. Mild: symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection, including fever,
fatigue, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Physical
examination shows congestion of the pharynx and no auscultatory
abnormalities. Some cases may have no fever, or have only digestive
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
3. Moderate: presented as pneumonia. Frequent fever and cough, mostly dry
cough, followed by productive cough , some may have wheezing, but no
obvious hypoxemia such as shortness of breath, and lungs can hear sputum
or dry snoring and / or wet snoring. Some cases may have no
clinical signs and symptoms, but chest computed tomography (CT) shows
lung lesions, which are subclinical.

4. Severe: Early respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough, may be
accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. The disease
usually progresses around 1 week, and dyspnea occurs, with central
cyanosis. Oxygen saturation is less than 92%, with other hypoxia
manifestations.
5. Critical: Children can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) or respiratory failure, and may also have shock, encephalopathy,
myocardial injury or heart failure, coagulation dysfunction, and acute kidney
injury, including multiple organ dysfunction. Can be life threatening.

A total of 1117 cases had their severity classified based on the reported clinical
data. One hundred fifty-nine (14.2%) cases were asymptomatic, 406 (36.3%) were mild,
514 (46.0%) were moderate, 25 (2.1%) were severe and 13 (1.2%) were critical cases.
Table 1 summarizes the severity of illness reported in each included study.

of 25 pediatric patients.
Normal or decreased platelet count were detailed in 15 studies, involving 32
cases.16,23,37,39–41,45,24,25,27,29,31–33,35 Normal platelet count were reported in 78.1% (22/32)
and descreased in 3.2% (1/32) of cases. Increased platelet count were reported in 6 of 63
(9.5%) cases.11,16,35,37,39–41,45,23–25,27,29,31–33
Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were described in 59 of 305 cases

level of 18.5 U/L and 27.7 U/L, respectively, in 10 cases.
Co-infections with other pathogens were reported in 5 studies.12,13,16,19,34 Two
patients were reported with influenza A, 5 with influenza B, 3 with respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV), 1 with cytomegalovirus, 7 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 1 with
Enterobacter aerogenes.

abnormalities. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground glass opacities,
patchy shadows and consolidations. In the study of Lu et al. involving 171 cases,
ground glass opacities and patchy shadowings were observed in 32.7% and 31% of
cases, respectively.3 Pleural effusion was observed in a 2-month-old child with
simultaneus RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.19

Outcomes
Clinical outcomes of death, discharged or still hospitalized were described for
371 cases in 32 studies.3,5,21–29,31,11,33–42,12,44,45,13,14,16–18,20 Of these, 62 cases were still
hospitalized when studies were submitted, 308 were discharged and 1 died.

DISCUSSION
In our study, we described the main clinical, laboratorial and radiological
characteristics of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in the literature. It was
observed that only a small proportion of infected children became severely or critically
ill. About half of the children with COVID-19 were asymptomatic or mild cases, and
several were classified as moderate due to radiological abnormalities in spite of their
mild clinical manifestations. The prognosis seems to be very good, with recovery
described in the vast majority of reported cases. Only one death was reported in the
included studies, a 10-month-old child with intussusception.3
Since COVID-19 has a favorable clinical course in children, the importance of
pediatric cases is mainly due to epidemiological issues. Despite being mild or
asymptomatic cases, prolonged viral shedding in stool and nasal secretions made
children facilitators of viral transmission.5,46 In the study of Xu et al., eight of ten
children with SARS-CoV02 had persistently positive rectal swabs even after their

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049833; this version posted April 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

nasopharyngeal tests were negative.46 This raises concerns about the possibility of a
fecal–oral route of transmission. The role of children in the transmission chain needs to
be urgently clarified to establish social and public health policies for the protection of
vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and people with comorbidities.
Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition is essential
for clinical management and outbreak control. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on
the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The WHO, CDC and
several other government health agencies emphasize fever and respiratory symptoms in
the criteria for suspected cases, however, we observed in our study that only 47.5% of
pediatric cases had fever.47,48 Since many are asymptomatic or mild cases, children
certainly are not tested as often as adults, leading to an underestimate of the true
numbers of infected people and increased transmission of the virus.
Guan et al. demonstrated pronounced lymphopenia in adults with COVID-19,
especially in severe cases, where the observed prevalence was 96.1%.4 Some authors
even suggest that lymphopenia is a predictor of prognosis in adult patients with
COVID-19.49t In our study, decreased lymphocyte count was described in only 12.9%
of infected children, in contrast with adults, in which 80% of the non-severe cases have
lymphopenia. With this, lymphopenia may not be a reliable indicator of COVID-19 in
children.
Similarly to adults, the most prevalent abnormalities on chest CT of children
with COVID-19 were ground glass opacities and patchy shadowings. However, while
86.2% of adults cases presented any abnormalities on chest CT, the same occurred in
only 63.0% of children in the selected studies. Descriptions of chest x-rays of pediatric
cases are scarce and would be usefull for resource-limited settings.

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, data from the same patient may have
been presented in more than one included study. Secondly, the majority of data are from
China, and may not be generalized for other populations.

CONCLUSION
Most children with COVID-19 have a favorable clinical course and their clinical
manifestations differ widely from adults cases. Fever and respiratory symptoms should
not be considered a hallmark of COVID-19 in children. With this, pediatricians should
have a high level of clinical suspicion to diagnose children infected with SARS-Cov-2,
as the majority of pediatric cases are asymptomatic or mild. Regardless of the favorable
prognosis, it is important that the child’s role in the contamination chain is precisely
established and considered.
