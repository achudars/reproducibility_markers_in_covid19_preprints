Abstract
Study Objectives: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a worldwide increase in
electronic devices' daily usage. The exposure to backlit screens before falling asleep leads
to negative consequences on sleep health through its influence on the circadian system. We
investigated the relationship between the changes in evening screen exposure and the time
course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19.
Methods: 2123 Italians were longitudinally tested during the third and the seventh week of
lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. During the second
assessment, respondents reported the changes in the backlit screen exposure in the two
hours before falling asleep.
Results: Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep
quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, higher sleep onset
latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor
sleepers and clinical insomniacs increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased
screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms.

In this

subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and clinical insomniacs decreased. Respondents
preserving their screen time habits did not show any change in the sleep parameters.
Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between the
modifications of the evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep
disturbances during the lockdown period. Interventions to raise public awareness about the
risks of excessive exposure to backlit screens are necessary to prevent sleep disturbances
and foster well-being during the home confinement due to COVID-19.

Statement of Significance
The present investigation is the first to provide insights about the relationship between the
changes in evening electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances
during the COVID-19 lockdown. Consistent with the well-known negative effect of backlit
screen lights on circadian physiology, we demonstrated a strong relationship between the
screen time modifications in the hours before falling asleep, the development and
exacerbation of sleep disturbances, and the changes of sleep/wake patterns during the
period of home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic. To date, hundreds of thousands
of people are subjected to restraining measures worldwide. Our findings have large scale
and broad-spectrum implications, considering the unavoidable increase of electronic device
usage during the current period of limited social interactions.

Introduction
The rapid worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic marked the first months of 2020.
During this unprecedented situation, governments across the globe implemented
extraordinary measures to reduce the spread of the contagion and the pressure on the
healthcare systems. From 9 March to 4 May 2020 a total lockdown was imposed in Italy,
involving a large-scale closure of most work activities, social distancing, and a home-based
quarantine imposition to the general population. The home confinement measures had a
substantial negative impact on global mental health and psychological well-being.1,2 The
considerable impairment of the daily routine had consistent repercussions on sleep health
and circadian rhythms, as documented by several studies.3–6 However, evidence on the time
course of sleep disturbances during the extended period of restraining measures is scarce.7
The forced social isolation and the limitations of the outdoor activities led to a worldwide
increase in web-based social communication.8–10 Electronic devices daily usage
increased11–13 to compensate for the limited social interactions, fill free time, and ward off
boredom. The implementation of these habits may have helped to cope with the challenging
and stressful isolation period. Nevertheless, the increase of screen exposure in the hours
before bedtime could have determined adverse consequences on sleep health. The sleep
rhythms are intimately linked with the ambient light, which represents a crucial regulator of
the biological clock. Human eyes comprise non-visual photoreceptors that are primarily
responsive to ~450–480 nm light within the blue portion of the spectrum.14,15 The activation
of this system leads to a suppression of the melatonin release, which is a key sleep-related
pineal gland hormone.16 The evening exposure to short-wavelength-enriched light has
alerting effects and detrimental consequences on sleep.17,18 Nowadays, most screens of
modern electronic devices (computer, smartphone, tablet, television) are equipped with
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) having a peak wavelength in the blue range of ~460 nm.19

Therefore, the exposure to backlit screens during the hours preceding the habitual bedtime
can interfere with the circadian physiology.
Epidemiological and cross-sectional studies indeed showed a strong relationship between
the electronic device usage after the sundown and alterations of sleep patterns.20–27 The
impact of screen exposure before falling asleep on the melatonin secretion was confirmed
by several studies that experimentally manipulated the evening exposure to tablet,28
eReader,29 and computer screens.19,30 These investigations also reported decreased
objective and self-reported sleepiness, higher sleep onset latency, and altered sleep
architecture. Conversely, other studies showed protective effects of blocking blue light
emissions on melatonin regulation31 and sleep quality, both in healthy32 and clinical
insomniac subjects.33,34
Based on this evidence, the present study aimed to shed light on the relationship between
the longitudinal changes of sleep disturbances between the third and the seventh week of
home confinement in Italy and the retrospectively reported modifications of the exposure to
electronic devices before falling asleep during the same lockdown period. We hypothesized
that the changes in electronic device usage could be a crucial mediator of the lockdownrelated sleep alterations over time. We expected that individuals that increased their screen
exposure should have shown the largest sleep impairments and the most marked alterations
of the sleep/wake schedule. On the other hand, subjects that reduced screen time should
have exhibited a positive time course of sleep disturbances.

Methods
Participants and procedure
The present investigation is part of a larger research project aimed to understand the
consequences of COVID-19 lockdown on the Italian population.6 A total of 7107 Italian
citizens were recruited in a web-based survey through a snowball sampling during the third

week of lockdown (25 March-31 March 2020). The survey comprised a demographic
questionnaire (age, gender, education, occupation, and geographical location), the
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index35 (PSQI), the Insomnia Severity Index36 (ISI), and the
reduced version of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire37 (MEQr), in this order. The
PSQI is a validated tool to evaluate sleep quality comprising nineteen questions, from which
a total score (range 0–19) is calculated. A score >5 identifies poor sleepers. The ISI is a
validated instrument used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms. The total score
ranging between 0 and 21, and a score >14 indicates the presence of moderate/severe
clinical insomnia condition. The MEQr is a validated questionnaire and its total score is used
to identify the chronotype (4–10 score: evening-type; 11–18 score: intermediate-type; 19–
25 score: morning-type). Subsequently, respondents could decide whether continue the
compilation of other three questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory-second edition,38 BDIII; 10-item Perceived Stress Scale,39 PSS-10; state-anxiety subscale of the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory,40 STAI-X1), with the option to stop after each of them. This optionality
was aimed at ensuring higher reliability of the data collected, avoiding false answers in the
last questionnaires. The BDI-II is a validated questionnaire used to assess clinical
depression symptoms (range 0–63). The 10-PSS is a 10-item questionnaire evaluating the
perceived stress following stressful events (range, 0–50). The STAI-X1 is a well-established
20-item scale measuring state anxiety (range, 1–80). For all these questionnaires, higher
scores indicate more severe conditions.
After four weeks, the website link of the follow-up survey was provided to the participants
via email address/telephone number. A total of 2701 subjects completed the second
assessment in a seven-day period (21-27 April 2020). From this large follow-up sample, we
included in the reported analyses only the 2123 respondents (mean age ± standard
deviation, 33.1 ± 11.6; range, 18-82; 401 men, see Table 1) that completed the first survey
during the four days preceding the daylight-saving time (25 March-28 March; Time 1). This

allowed us to avoid interfering and confounding effects at the baseline measurement due to
the summertime beginning (for a review,41). During the follow-up survey (Time 2),
participants completed the same questionnaires of Time 1. Moreover, they were asked to
retrospectively evaluate the changes (increase, maintenance, reduction) from the first
assessment in the usage duration of electronic devices (smartphone, computer, tablet,
television, eReader) in the two hours before falling asleep. The study has been approved by
the institutional review board of the University of L’Aquila (protocol n. 43066) and has been
carried out according to the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki. Online
informed consent to participate in the whole research was obtained from all the respondents
during the first assessment.

Data analysis
To control for potential selection bias of the follow-up participants, we performed preliminary
mixed model analyses comparing the Time 1 questionnaire scores of respondents that
participated only to the first assessment and those who attended both the measurements
(Time 1 and Time 2). These control analyses did not highlight significant differences (all P
> 0.10).
According to the purpose of the present study, the main variables were the PSQI and ISI
scores. Additionally, from the PSQI questionnaire, we extracted other variables such as total
sleep time (TST, min), sleep onset latency (SOL, min), bedtime (BT, hh:mm), and rise time
(RT, hh:mm). To evaluate the time course of the sleep dimensions as a function of the
reported changes of exposure to electronic devices, all the above variables were submitted
to mixed model analyses with a random intercept per participant, accounting for the
expected intraindividual variability. The models comprised “time” (Time 1, Time 2), “screen
exposure” (increased, unchanged, reduced), and their interaction as predictors. Additionally,
“gender” (man, woman) was included as factor, and age as covariate, to control for putative
effects of these demographic variables on the main outcomes of the present study.
Subsequently, explorative analyses were carried out adding to the models the scores of
MEQr, BDI-II, 10-PSS, and STAI-X1 as covariates. These further analyses aimed to control
the effects of chronotype, depression, stress, and anxiety on sleep measures. Mixed model
analyses were performed using the “lme4” R package.42 Models were fitted using REML,
using the Satterthwaite approximation to compute P-values. Bonferroni post hoc tests were
obtained using the “emmeans” R package.43 Finally, the validated cut-off scores of PSQI
and ISI were used to determine the prevalence of poor sleepers and moderate/severe
insomnia condition. Subsequently, McNemar tests were performed to evaluate the
modifications of the prevalence of sleep disturbances between Time 1 and Time 2 in the
three groups characterized by different changes of exposure to electronic devices before

falling asleep. For all the analyses, statistical significance was set at P < 0.05, and all tests
were 2-tailed.

Results
Relationships between screen exposure and sleep variables
Mixed model analyses did not highlight significant effects of the “time” factor for all the
examined variables (PSQI: F1,2027.32 = 0.11, P = 0.75; ISI: F1,2117 = 0.75, P = 0.39; TST:
F1,2112.44 = 1.37, P = 0.24; SOL: F1,2112.92 = 0.49, P = 0.49; BT: F1,2111.55 = 0.10, P = 0.76; RT:
F1,2111.77 = 0.14, P = 0.71; respectively). “Screen exposure” was significant for all the
variables (PSQI: F2,2109.30 = 29.57, P < 0.001; ISI: F2,2116 = 32.51, P < 0.001; TST: F2,2115.08
= 6.74, P = 0.001; SOL: F2,2115.20 = 6.14, P = 0.002; BT: F2,2114.85 = 7.14, P < 0.001; RT:
F2,2115.39 = 5.26, P = 0.005). The interaction between “time” and “screen exposure” predictors
(Figure 1 and Figure 2) was also significant for all the variables (PSQI: F2,2010.42 = 20.29, P
< 0.001; ISI: F2,2117 = 23.70, P < 0.001; TST: F2,2112.55 = 9.07, P < 0.001; SOL: F2,2113.04 =
6.70, P = 0.001; BT: F2,2111.64 = 30.11, P < 0.001; RT: F2,2111.84 = 20.63, P < 0.001).
Post hoc comparisons between Time 1 and Time 2 suggested that participants who reported
an increase of electronic device usage before falling asleep also showed a significant
increase over time of PSQI and ISI scores (both P < 0.001), a reduction of TST (P < 0.001),
a prolongation of SOL (P = 0.03), and delayed BT and RT (both P < 0.001). On the other
hand, participants who reduced the screen exposure showed concurrent decreases of PSQI
and ISI scores (P = 0.04, P = 0.02; respectively), an anticipation of the BT (P = 0.009), and
a preservation of TST and SOL (P = 1.00, P = 0.58; respectively). No differences in all the
variables were obtained for the participant who maintained unchanged their electronic
device use habits (all P = 1.00).
At Time 1, there were no differences in PSQI and ISI scores between respondents who later
reported an increase or a reduction of screen exposure (both P = 1.00). Participants

maintaining their device use habits showed lower PSQI scores at Time 1, compared to those
who increased or reduced the exposure to backlit screens (both P < 0.001). ISI scores were
lower at Time 1 for subjects who did not change the screen exposure than participants who
incremented or reduced it (P < 0.001, P = 0.04; respectively). The three groups did not differ
at Time 1 on TST, SOL, BT, and RT (all P > 0.85).
Participants who reported an increase of screen exposure also showed higher PSQI and ISI

Mean ± standard error of the bedtime (A) and rise time (B) at the two assessments (Time 1,

reported with asterisks (** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001).

Further control analyses confirmed the above-reported pattern of results, controlling for the
covariance of age, gender, chronotype, depression, perceived stress, and anxiety. In
particular, the interaction between “time” and “screen exposure” remained significant for all
the variables (PSQI: F2,1605.95 = 17.50, P < 0.001; ISI: F2,1685.08 = 14.20, P < 0.001; TST:
F2,1694.81 = 8.37, P < 0.001; SOL: F2,1711.04 = 4.53, P = 0.01; BT: F2,1664.94 = 17.11, P < 0.001;
RT: F2,1645.32 = 12.70, P < 0.001), confirming the crucial mediation role of the changes in
screen exposure in explaining the time course of the sleep outcomes during the lockdown.
Finally, in light of the differences between the subgroups at Time 1 for PSQI and ISI scores,
we performed control analyses to evaluate if the screen-related differences at Time 2 were
affected by the baseline scores. ANCOVAs on the Time 2 ISI and PSQI scores with “screen
exposure” as factor and Time 1 scores as covariate were significant (both P < 0.001).
Bonferroni post hoc comparisons showed that respondents who increased the screen time
showed the poorest sleep quality and the most severe insomnia symptoms (all P < 0.001)

Relationships between screen exposure and sleep disturbance prevalence
McNemar tests highlighted a significant prevalence increase of poor sleepers (+11.4%) and
of moderate/severe insomnia condition (+3.6%) in the group of respondents reporting an
increased usage of electronic devices before falling asleep (2 = 108.23, P < 0.001; 2 =

Discussion
In the present study, we showed a strong relationship between the changes in evening
screen exposure and the time course of sleep parameters during the COVID-19 lockdown.
In line with the initial assumption, individuals declaring increased electronic device usage
before falling asleep showed a general sleep impairment over time (from the third to the
seventh week of home confinement). This outcome is exemplified by decreased sleep
quality, an exacerbation of insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, and longer sleep
onset latency. Consistently, we found an increased prevalence of poor sleepers and
moderate/severe insomnia condition only within this group of respondents. The increased
screen exposure was also linked to delayed bedtime and rising time, outlining an advanced
sleep phase across the home confinement period.
Furthermore, individuals who increased the device usage showed the poorest sleep quality,
the most severe insomnia symptoms, the lowest sleep duration, the highest sleep onset
latency, and they went to bed and woke up later compared to the other participants during
the seventh week of lockdown.
On the other hand, participants reporting decreased evening screen exposure showed the
opposite time course of sleep disturbances. They indeed exhibited improved sleep quality
and mitigation of insomnia symptoms, which turned in a prevalence reduction of poor
sleepers and clinical insomnia condition. This group of respondents anticipated bedtime
after four weeks of home confinement. Finally, the respondents who maintained unchanged
their electronic device usage habits did not show any modification in all the examined
dimensions, except for a prevalence reduction of moderate/severe insomnia conditions.
Remarkably, we obtained the present findings controlling for the effects of gender and age,
and they were confirmed also controlling for the covariance of chronotype, depression,
stress, and anxiety. Therefore, our results indicate a direct relationship between evening

device usage and time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period,
independent of other psychological and circadian dimensions.
The pattern of results of our longitudinal investigation is consistent with a large pre-outbreak
cross-sectional literature addressing the relationship between sleep and evening electronic
device usage. In particular, higher screen time has been associated with reduced sleep
duration,20,44–46 prolongation of sleep onset latency,21–24,46 later sleep onset and waking
up,20,21,45 poor sleep quality,20–24 and insomnia symptoms.21,26,44
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all the world, and the home confinement constitutes
the most widely used measure to contrast the spread of the contagion. In modern societies,
the increase of screen-based device usage could represent an unavoidable consequence
of the pandemic-related home confinement periods. Indeed, more than one-third of our
sample reported an increase in electronic device usage in the two hours before falling
asleep. Consequently, our findings have substantial large-scale implications when
contextualized to the current unprecedented situation.
Adequate sleep quantity/quality is essential to deal with stressful events47 and preserve
mental health,48,49 and it plays a crucial role in emotional processing 50,51 and mood
regulation.52 Indeed, aberrant light exposure and excessive screen time were associated
with sleep and mental health problems.53,54 Consistently, blocking screen-emitted blue light
has proved to be effective in promoting at the same time sleep quality and mood32,34 and it
was proposed as a useful approach to treat both clinical insomnia33,34 and mood disorders.
53,55

Finally, sleep and the circadian system support the proper functioning of the immune

system,56,57 never as important as during the current historical period. In light of these
considerations, the relationship between screen time and sleep outcomes has a broad
spectrum of implications, configuring a major public health concern during COVID-19
outbreak.

The present results were obtained in an Italian sample, but they could be generalizable to
other modern societies since the putative underlying mechanisms involve a disruption of
circadian physiology and a direct arousal-induced effect caused by evening light exposure.
However, we can not infer the causality of this relationship since this is an observational
study, and the measurement of screen exposure changes has been retrospectively reported
during the second assessment. Notwithstanding that comprehensive literature supported
the detrimental effect of the blue light emitted by electronic devices on melatonin secretion
and sleep patterns,19,28–30 we can not exclude reverse causation. Nevertheless, the two
interpretations are not mutually exclusive, and a bidirectional model of causation has been
suggested.58 We propose that a vicious circle during the confinement period was
established, in which the increased screen exposure before falling asleep negatively
impacted the sleep parameters, which in turn supported the overuse of electronic devices
after the sunset.
In conclusion, our findings corroborate the assumption that the governments should pursue
policies to raise public awareness on healthy sleep behaviors during the confinement due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, discouraging the excessive use of electronic devices before
falling asleep.59,60 The evening use of blue light glasses and the application of blue
wavelength light filter (night shift settings) on the electronic screens should be encouraged
to mitigate the well-known detrimental consequences of electronic device usage. To date,
the feared risk of a second wave of contagion is increasingly becoming a concrete reality,
and hundreds of thousands of people are subjected to home confinement measures
worldwide. In light of our results, the above-mentioned interventions focused on sleep
hygiene are fundamental to counteract the occurrence and exacerbation of sleep
disturbances and foster the general well-being during the home confinement due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Limitations
To the best of our knowledge, the present investigation is the first to provide insights about
the relationship between electronic device usage and the time course of sleep disturbances
during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, it should be acknowledged that we used a nonprobabilistic sampling technique, and the sample comprised a higher prevalence of women
and young people. Moreover, under-eighteen years-old individuals were not included.
However, the relationship between evening screen time and sleep disturbances was widely
shown in adolescents.61–63 We hypothesize that our results could be generalizable to the
youngest people. Additionally, the electronic device category of our survey included a broad
set of devices, and we can not discern the relationship between each device usage and the
time course of the sleep outcomes. Finally, in our survey, we did not assess the
implementation of protective approaches to reduce the emission or perception of screen
light, and thus we can not estimate their contribution to the present findings.
