Abstract
Background
It is to be determined whether people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop long-term
immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective antibodies after the
infection is resolved. This study was to explore to explore the outcomes of IgG
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in four groups of individuals in Wuhan, China.

Methods
We included the following four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19
IgM/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29,
2020: 1470 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan
Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, 3832 healthcare providers
without COVID-19 diagnosis, 19555 general workers, and 1616 other patients to be
admitted to the hospital (N=26473). COVID-19 patients who received IgM/IgG tests <21
days after symptom onset were excluded.

Results
IgG prevalence was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in COVID-19 patients, 4.0% (95% CI
3.4-4.7%) in healthcare providers, 4.6 (95% CI 4.3-4.9 %) in general workers, and 1.0%
in other patients (p all <0.001 for comparisons with COVID-19 patients). IgG prevalence
increased significantly by age among healthcare workers and general workers.
Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% in
healthcare providers, 1.3% in general workers, and 0.2% in other patients.

Conclusions
Very few healthcare providers had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a significant
proportion of them had been infected with the virus. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people
are unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.

Introduction

Currently, coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1-4 has become a global pandemic. The virus
was freely transmitted among residents in the communities5-8 in Wuhan, China from late
November 2019 till several days after the lockdown of the city on January 23, 2020.
Most of SARS-CoV-2 infections do not require medical attention9-11 and only about 5%
COVID-19 cases in China need intensive care12. As of May 20, 2020, no effective
therapies or vaccines for COVID-19 have been reported. Though, numerous therapeutic
approaches are under investigation around the world, including existing anti-human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
influenza virus medications13, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir14,
antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab, serum from
recovered COVID-19 patients, and inactivated virus, subunit and recombinant vaccines.
Among those therapeutic approaches, Remdesivir is most promising so far, although an
underpowered trial failed to demonstrate treatment benefits.15,16

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients is usually confirmed using realtime reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.17-19 Due to
sample collection method, discrepancies in personnel skills training and low virus load
in throat swabs after symptom onset20, RT-PCR methods have high false-negative test
results19,21,22. Several days after symptom onset when infected patients start to seek
medical attention, virus load in clinical specimens of upper respiratory tract will become

relatively low20,23. It often takes two or three repeatedly collected specimens to get a
positive test result in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 enters respiratory epithelial cells
via interactions with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)24. The spike (S) protein of
SARS-CoV-2 mediates binding of the virus with Spike protein’s receptor ACE2 and
promotes fusion of viral and host cell membranes and subsequent virus entry into the
host cell. In patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IgM antibodies are detectable around 7
days post infection and IgG antibodies usually take two weeks to develop.20,24-26
Recently, several COVID-19 IgM/IgG rapid tests have been developed around the
world27. It is reported that in some recovered COVID-19 patients who had two negative
RT-PCR tests on nasal or throat swabs taken at least 24 hours apart, segments of virus
RNA were still detected in other types of clinical samples, especially in fecal swabs28.
Additionally, some patients had recurrent positive RT-PCR tests on nasal or throat
swabs after recovered from COVID-19.28 It still unknown whether COVID-19 patients
will develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and retain long-lasting protective
antibodies after the infection is resolved. Large-scale sero-epidemiological studies are
also needed to assess infection attack rates and disease incidence in the population
and herd immunity. In this study, we reported the experiences in COVID-19 IgM/IgG
testing in Wuhan. We assessed prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and
Leishenshan Hospital (set up on an emergency basis to admit COVID-19 patients and
managed by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University), and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital,
healthcare providers without a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis working in Zhongnan
Hospital of Wuhan University, and people from the general population in Wuhan.

Considering that Wuhan was the early epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak, most of these
healthcare providers would be inevitably exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the early days
of the outbreak (from late November 2019 to January 20, 2020) when person-to-person
transmission was not suspected and little personal protection against this virus was
employed among medical personnel, a significant proportion of whom would get
infected with the virus.

Results

Characteristics of participants

Mean age was 58.7 years in 1470 COVID-19 patients, 37.1 years in 3832 healthcare
providers, 41.6 years in 19555 general workers and 53.3 years in other patients (Table
1). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were composed of more older people, while
healthcare providers and general workers were mostly young adults. Among COVID-19
patients, median time from symptom onset to IgM/IgG test was 41 days (interquartile
range 33-50 days). The last RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in only eight
COVID-19 patients and none of three patients was tested negative for IgG antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2.

Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2

Prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 89.8% (95% CI 88.2-91.3%) in

COVID-19 patients (Table 2) compared to 4.0% (95% CI 3.4-4.7%) in healthcare
providers, 4.6% (95% CI 4.3-4.9%) in general workers, and 1.0% in other patients (p all
<0.001 for comparing to COVID-19 patients). Only the comparison of IgG prevalence
between healthcare workers and general workers was not significant (p=0.39). IgG
prevalence increased significantly by age among healthcare providers, and was 2.8% in
those <30 years old, 9.6% in those 60-69 years old and 10.0% in those ≥70 years old
(p<0.001 for trend). IgG prevalence also increased significantly by age among general
workers. Prevalence of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 31.4% (95% CI 29.0-33.7%)
in COVID-19 patients, 1.5% (95% CI 1.1-1.8%) in healthcare providers, 1.3 (95% CI
1.1-1.5%) in general workers, and 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.4%) in other patients (Table 3).

IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and mortality in COVID-19 patients

Among COVID-19 patients, mean age was similar between those with IgG antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 and those without (Table 4). Presence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
was not associated with most demographic characteristics, disease severity, presence
of comorbidities, treatment received, and clinical characteristics, except for antibiotics
treatment, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine treatment, and needing intubation. IgG
prevalence and IgM prevalence among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 by
demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 5. Mortality rate was 1.3%
(95% CI 0.7-1.9%) in those with IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and was 3.3% (95% CI
0.4-6.2%) in those without (Figure 1). Mortality risk was similar between those with IgG
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and those without (adjusted hazard ratio 0.45 95% CI 0.16-

Discussion

We analyzed prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19
patients, healthcare providers without a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, general
workers, and other patients to be admitted to hospital. The most intriguing finding of this
study is that only 4% of healthcare providers without confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis
had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in their blood. Most of the healthcare providers were
exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the first few months of the outbreak when use of
personal protection equipment was sparse as person-to-person transmission was not
suspected. COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests in the US and around the world as reported in the
news constantly showed that the true infection rate would be 10 to 80 times higher than
that had been confirmed by RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence of
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in 1021 people before resuming work from April 3 to 15,
2020 in Wuhan was reported to be ~10%,29 about 20 times higher than the infection
attack rate calculated from the confirmed COVID-19 cases. In New York City, a 21.2%
positive rate was reported with young and middle-aged people having the highest
positive rate. The proportion of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have no
symptom or only mild symptoms that do not need medical attention or hospitalization
may account for the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Currently, no effective
therapeutics are available for treating COVID-19 patients. Detecting patients with
SARA-CoV-2 infection who are not in urgent need of hospitalization will provide no

benefit to these patients, though it may have important public health applications in
tracing their close contacts and preventing these people from spreading the infection to
others. In Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, 2.88% (118/4099) healthcare
workers were diagnosed with COVID-19 before March 16, 2020. With a moderate
estimation, the true infection rate would be ten times that had been confirmed, i.e., >25%
of those healthcare providers without diagnosed COVID-19 had been infected. However,
only 4% of those infected healthcare workers without confirmed COVID-19 still had IgG
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. They just got infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cleared the
virus by their own immune systems. No long-lasting protective antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 were produced in these healthcare providers. Our observed high
prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in older groups (60-69 years old and ≥70
years old) among health care workers and general worker in Wuhan also raised the
concern that IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 would be lost some time after the infection
was cleared, as young or middle-aged people usually took more social responsibilities
and had higher chances to get infected during lockdown of the city. We also found
that >10% of confirmed COVID-19 cases had no detectable serum levels of IgG
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after 21 days post symptom onset. They were unlikely to not
produce IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after being infected with the virus20,24-26,30. Long
et al reported that after 17-19 days post symptom onset, IgG was positive in all patients
with COVID-19.30 Lack of blood samples >17 days post symptom onset may be
responsible for negative IgG tests in some patients reported in previous literatures.25,26
Therefore, >10% patients in our study who had no IgG antibodies after 21 days post
symptom onset most likely lost those IgG antibodies after the infection was resolved.

After infection with SARS-CoV-1, patients start to produce SARS-specific IgG antibody
in the second week, which persists for a long time31,32. Even after 210 days after
symptom onset, neutralizing viral antibodies (anti-viral IgG) are still detectable in
recovered SARS patients33. It is believed that the Spike protein and nucleocapsid
protein play a central role in the antibody production31,32,34. Research has focused on
developing vaccines and therapeutics targeting the Spike protein35,36 and the
nucleocapsid protein37. However, our findings indicate that people are unlikely to
develop long-lasting neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Infections with some viruses, such as HIV, do not illicit robust protective immunity38,
while common cold coronavirus only generate partial protective immunity39. Crossreactive antibodies in convalescent SARS patients' sera can neutralize other human
betacoronaviruses40, as those viruses share a significant B-cell epitope overlapping the
heptad repeat-2 region of the Spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 also belongs to
betacoronaviruses. However, no individuals or populations had shown explicit immunity
to SARS-CoV-2 and every human being in the world was susceptible to this virus before
it first jumped from wild animals to humans. It might be due to the dramatic differences
between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding region of Spike protein
and the key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2.24
Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 may not produce reliable immunoprotection
against SARS-CoV-2. However, why long-lasting protective antibodies are not produced
after SARS-CoV-2 infection is still to be studied.

Are IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 parts of short-term immunity against this virus? It is
reported that after infected with SARS-CoV-2, rhesus macaques produced antibodies
that exhibited neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and re-challenge with
the same viral dose weeks post initial infection was not successful.41,42 This indicates
that short-term neutralizing antibodies may be produced in this animal model. However,
infected monkeys have a faster viral clearance mechanism than humans and reinfection
protection for humans even in a short time period after the initial infection might not
necessarily happen. We found mortality risks were similar between hospitalized COVID19 patients with IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and those without, which indicates that
absence of IgG antibodies may not affect clinical end outcome and IgG antibodies may
even not be part of short-term protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2.
Whether therapeutic antibodies targeting the spike protein are effective is also a
question. A recent study characterized the viral spike protein receptor-binding domainspecific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells of patients with COVID-19.43
In that study, the three most server cases (one dead) had much higher plasma binding
activities to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, spike protein receptor-binding domain, and
nucleocapsid protein than the other five cases with mild symptoms, which casts some
doubts on the relationship between antibody response and disease progression and the
utilization of neutralizing antibodies as prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2
interventions. Antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entry via the binding of those
neutralizing antibodies and the spike protein is also a big concern to be closely
monitored44-47.

Our findings have important implications for herd immunity, antibody-based therapeutics,
public health strategies, and vaccine development. First, as infected people do not
develop long-lasting protecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the idea of immune
certificate for recovered COVID-19 patients is invalid. This finding also raises concerns
for reinfection, chronic infection, and validity of the herd immunity theory for SARS-CoV2. Second, COVID-19 IgG antibodies as tested by the kits may simply serve as a sign of
the infection status and might not be protective neutralizing antibodies. The utilization of
convalescent serum from recovered COVID-19 patients in clinical settings48 would be
questionable. Clinical trials on the efficacy of convalescent serum from recovered
COVID-19 patients in treating COVID-19 cases were conducted in Wuhan. Their results
will provide further evidence to help elucidate the role of COVID-19 IgG antibodies.
Third, as serum COVID-19 IgM/IgG level can become undetectable after recovery in
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 IgM/IgG test will not be a reliable tool
for the surveillance of past infections of SARS-CoV-2 in areas where the epidemic is
over. Finally, in our study, most of the healthcare providers without a confirmed COVID19 diagnosis have been exposed to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus in a highly
contagious environment. However, none of them developed long-lasting protective
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These findings raise the concern if the inactivated
virus, subunit, and recombinant vaccines currently under development will be able to
induce effective immune protections against SARS-CoV-2.

The main strength of this study is that we analyzed data on COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests on
a large cohort of individuals from two hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19

outbreak in China. Antibody tests on healthcare providers provided valuable information
on outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Limitations of this study include that we do not
have long-term follow-up data on recovered COVID-19 patients. Whether or not those
patients will lose COVID-19 IgG antibodies in the next few months is still to be studied.
Additionally, COVID-19 IgM/IgG test does not have perfect sensitivity and specificity for
detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the serum. Nevertheless, we observed that
very few healthcare providers without a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had a positive
test result. This observed phenomenon strongly suggests that long-term protective
antibodies are unlikely produced after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In conclusion, very few healthcare providers without confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in
Wuhan have IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, though a substantial portion of them had
been infected with the virus. More than 10% of COVID-19 patients did not have those
antibodies after 21 days post symptom onset. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, people are
unlikely to produce long-lasting protective antibodies against this virus.

Online Methods

Study Design and Participants

The study was approved by the institutional ethics board at Zhongnan Hospital of
Wuhan University. Requirement for written informed consent was waived by the
institutional ethics board for emerging infectious diseases. We included the following
four groups of individuals who received both COVID-19 IgM/IgG tests and RT-PCR
tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29, 2020 to April 29, 2020: hospitalized patients
with COVID-19 from Leishenshan Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University,
and Wuhan No. 7 Hospital who received these tests before being discharged from
hospital, healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, and nursing workers) without a
confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis working in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University who
received these tests before resuming normal clinical services for patients without
COVID-19, general workers in Wuhan before returning to work, and other patients who
received these screening tests before being admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University. There were 1603 patients with COVID-19 who received both COVID-19
IgM/IgG tests and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from February 29 to April 5, 2020 (the
last test result was used for analyses). Eighty-four patients were transferred from
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University to Leishenshan Hospital and were only counted
once each. We excluded 133 patients with COVID-19 whose IgM/IgG tests were less
than 21 days after symptom onset to allow enough time for IgG antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 to develop. There were 4099 healthcare providers working in Zhongnan

Hospital of Wuhan University, of whom 118 were diagnosed of COVID-19 before March
16, 2020 and 3835 healthcare providers without diagnosed COVID-19 received both
tests before resuming normal clinical services. Three healthcare providers who were
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR tests in their throat swabs were also
excluded from the analyses. Before returning to work, 19570 general workers in Wuhan
without a diagnosis of COVID-19 who received both tests at Zhongnan Hospital of
Wuhan University, of whom 15 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR tests
in their throat swabs and were excluded from the analyses. Before admitted to
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for other conditions, 1628 patients without
COVID-19 diagnosis received both tests for screening for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 12
were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR tests in their throat swabs and were
removed from the analyses. In total, we included 1470 patients with COVID-19, 3832
healthcare providers, 19555 workers, and 1616 other patients in the final analyses
(N=26473). Follow up time for death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was
calculated as from symptom onset until either discharge from hospital or April 15, 2020,
which came first.

Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on epidemiological history, clinical manifestations
and presence of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples confirmed by using real-time RT-PCR
method.11 There were changes in diagnosis of COVID-19 in China, and the case

admission was defined as moderate, severe, or critical. Patients with mild diseases
were not admitted to the above three hospitals and were generally admitted to
Fangcang Hospitals (makeshift hospitals).

RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA

Clinical specimens collection and RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were previously
described18. Clinical specimens in COVID-19 patients included nasal swabs, throat
swabs, sputum, anal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and clinical specimens
in healthcare providers without confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were only throat swabs.
In brief, clinical specimens were collected from these people by trained nurses or
physicians wearing proper personal protection equipment. RT-PCR tests for SARSCoV-2 were performed using a nucleic acid detection kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The test simultaneously amplifies and detects two target genes, including open
reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Primers used for those two
target genes are as follows: ORF1ab: forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA,
reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe 5′-VICCCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3′; N: forward primer
GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG,
and the probe 5′-FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3′. Conditions for the
amplifications were incubation at 50 °C for 15 minutes and 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed
by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 seconds and extension at 55 °C for 45
seconds. The diagnostic criteria for positive and negative RT-PCR results were based

on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and
Prevention (China): positive result <37 cycle threshold value (Ct-value) and negative
result ≥40. A Ct-value of 37-39 required retesting.

COVID-19 IgM/IgG test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

Serum samples from these people were collected. Methods for testing serum IgM and
IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were previously described.50 COVID-19 IgM/IgG test kits
contained recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein and nucleocapsid protein)
labelled with magnetic beads (tested on a fullyautomated chemiluminescence
immunoassay analyzer) or colloidal gold (test card), anti-human IgM monoclonal
antibody, and anti-human IgG monoclonal antibody. These test kits were reported to
have high sensitivity and specificity27,50. According to the manufacturers, the sensitivity
and specificity are ~90% and >99% for IgM, and ~98% and ~98% for IgG, respectively.

Two physicians extracted the following data using data collection form from electronic
medical records: demographic information such as age and sex, RT-PCR test date and
results, COVID-19 IgM/IgG test date and results, date of symptom onset for COVID-19
patients, treatments received, and clinical outcomes. Another physician in the research
team reviewed the collected data.

Continuous variables were reported using mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) if
normally distributed or median and interquartile if nonnormally distributed. Categorical
variables were described as frequency rates and percentages. The χ2 test was used for
the comparison of categorical variables and Fisher’s exact test was used when
frequency was too low. Multigroup comparisons were performed using ANOVA test,
following by Tukey test for adjusting for multiple comparisons. Prevalence of positive
IgG test results and 95% CI was also reported. For the assessment of RT-PCR test
results of SARS-CoV-2 and IgM/IgG test results, the last test result for each person was
used in the analyses. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to show survival differences in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients by the status of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
Adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI were calculated by fitting a Cox proportional hazard
model, controlling for age, sex, and severity of COVID-19 at admission. Statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute; Carey, NC). A
2-sided p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
