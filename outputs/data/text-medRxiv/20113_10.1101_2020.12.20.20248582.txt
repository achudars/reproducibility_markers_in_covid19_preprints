Abstract— Several studies suggest that COVID-19 may be
accompanied by symptoms such as a dry cough, muscle aches,
sore throat, and mild to moderate respiratory illness. The
symptoms of this disease indicate the fact that COVID-19 causes
noticeable negative effects on the lungs. Therefore, considering
the health status of the lungs using X-rays and CT scans of the
chest can significantly help diagnose COVID-19 infection. Due
to the fact that most of the methods that have been proposed to
COVID-19 diagnose deal with the lengthy testing time and also
might give more false positive and false negative results, this
paper aims to review and implement artificial intelligence (AI)
image-based diagnosis methods in order to detect coronavirus
infection with zero or near to zero false positives and false
negatives rates. Besides the already existing AI image-based
medical diagnosis method for the other well-known disease, this
study aims on finding the most accurate COVID-19 detection
method among AI methods such as machine learning (ML) and
artificial neural network (ANN), ensemble learning (EL)
methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

transmission of this disease among people in a community or
even health facilities [1,2]. Since most of the excited test
needs a lot of time to generate the result compared to the time
for spreading virus among people, chest X-Ray or Computer
Tomography (CT) scan images of COVID19 is used to
provide a rapid and efficient way to test the COVID-19
suspected individuals. It is an undeniable fact that artificial
intelligence plays a central role in making human daily life
more convenient than the past. The advantage of AI methods
is their ability to interpret and understand the digital images in
order to identify and classify objects. For this reason, many
researchers in the world of artificial intelligence have drawn
attention to research on the data obtained from patients who
infected with COVID-19. Sachin Sharma [3] presents a study
that aims to discuss the importance of machine learning
methods to distinguish COVID-19 infected regarding their
lung CT scan images. Nripendra Narayan Das et al. [4] use
chest X-rays in order to find some radiological signatures of
COVID-19 by using deep learning of the chest CT scans.
Aayush Jaiswal et al. [5] use the pre-trained deep learning
architectures (DenseNet201) along with deep transfer learning
in order to provide an automated tool that aims to detect
COVID-19 positive and negative infected patients based on
chest CT images. Xueyan Mei et al. [6] combine chest CT
records including the patients’ essential symptoms. In this
pioneer research the interaction between the chest CT and the
clinical symptoms is conducted through basic machine
learning methods, i.e., SVM, random forest, MLP, and deep
learning to accurately predict COVID-19. In an alternative
approach, Pinter et al. [7] present the hybrid machine learning
method of ANFIS and MLP to predict mortality rate of
COVID-19 patients. Sina F. Ardabili et al. [8] review a wide
range of machine learning models to forecast the COVID-19
outbreak. Their study presents a number of suggestions to
demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future
research.

COVID-19 is a global pandemic that collapsed the
healthcare systems in most countries. In the year 2020, people
all over the world witnessed the news of the death of their
fellow human beings from many world news agencies.
Furthermore, this pandemic event has affected the operations
of healthcare facilities. The medical centres witnessed
increases in patients who are needing care for a respiratory
illness that could be COVID-19 (+) or COVID-19 (-). The
World Health Organization (WHO) advises that all countries
to consider the importance of the test because the isolation of
all confirmed cases and also mild cases in health centers is

II. BRIEF REVIEW OF MACHINE LEANING-BASED MODELS
AI has the potential to improve medical imaging
capabilities and patient diagnosis. Using ML, ANN, and
ensemble learning methods for medical image recognition is
a core component of computer vision in this widespread study
area. ML methodology works based on the cognitive learning
methods to advance an intelligent code without use of
conventional programing techniques. The performance of
ML algorithms’ is associated with other mathematical
techniques and improved by experience [4]. Generally, ML
uses historical data to make decisions and uncover hidden
insights [5]. In image-based diagnosis problems, the ML
models are advanced to be able to learn from medical records.
This process is often done through developing insight into the
patterns within complex imaging [6]. The following
subsection describes the basic and ensemble AI-based image
classifier methods in a brief way.
A. Single models
In the following, the basic classifiers employed for
diagnosing COVID-19 are introduced.
• Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the commonlyused algorithms in research and industry, taking its power
from machine learning algorithms. The main advantage
of this algorithm is its ability to deal with non-linear
problems. SVM can be used to solve nonlinear
classification problems by transforming the problem
using the kernel method which makes SVM calculation
in the higher dimension. Vapnik was first introduced
SVM in 1995[]. He used the Statistic Learning Theory
(SLT) and Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) to
introduce this concept. SVM can be effectively employed
in classification, regression, and nonlinear function
approximation problems [9,10].
• Naive Bayes (NB) is a well-known probabilistic
classification algorithm that applies Bayes' Theorem with
an assumption of strong (naive) independence among
predictors (a set of supervised learning algorithms).
During the process of constructing classifiers (training),
the NB model needs a small amount of training data to
estimate the vital parameters [11]. In other words, the
previous probability of each class is estimated by
calculating the conditional probability density function
and the posterior probability. Eventually, the final
prediction is made for the class that has the largest
posterior probability.
• Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computing
systems that widely used for image-based medical
diagnosis problems. In fact, ANN draws inspiration from

biological neural systems and creates an interconnected
network of ‘neurons that process information. These
models consist of several processing elements that
reproduce input data in a hierarchical structure. During
the training process, a corresponding weight (for each
input data) must be iteratively estimated and adjusted.
Due to the variation of connections between layers in an
ANN, the architecture of networks is able to design
variously. Deciding the number of layers and nodes in
each layer depends on the problem and the amount of
training data. For this reason, ANN is a great (flexible)
option to deal with different classification, regression,
and clustering problems [12,13].
• Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a well-known ANN in
which neurons are distributed in thoroughly connected
layers. These layers are divided into three groups: input
layers, output layers, and hidden layers. The weighted
inputs are linearly combined by their corresponding
neuron; then, the results are transferred through a
nonlinear activation function. Usually, a gradient-descent
algorithm called back-propagation is used to train an
MLP. In this algorithm, a maximum error is defined to be
used as a criterion to stop the iterative weight update
process [14].
• CNN is a deep neural network that is commonly applied to
process large scale images. As same as the other ANN,
CNN is a network that includes several layers. In CNN
represents a sequential connection between the layers. As
the output of the previous layer is interconnected with the
input of other layer. However, unlike the other fully
connected neural network, in this network, the neurons in
one layer do not connect to all the neurons in the next
layer. The main powerful part of CNN is the convolution
layer [15,16].
B. Ensemble models
Ensemble models are able to scale up the performance of
classification and regression processes. Boosting and Bagging
are the most widely-used ensemble learning frameworks in
science literature. Bagging ensembles create subsets and
ensemble estimates using Bootstrap re-sampling and a mean
combiner respectively. Boosting ensemble models train a
number of individual models in a sequential way. A way that
provides an opportunity for each model to learns from
mistakes made by the previous model [17].
• AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning
algorithm that can be used in conjunction with many other
types of learning algorithms to improve performance.
AdaBoost initially created to enhance the performance of
binary classifiers. The main idea of AdaBoost is about
using an iterative approach in order to learn from the
mistakes of weak classifiers, and turn them into strong
ones. In fact, AdaBoost learns from the mistakes by
increasing the weight of misclassified data points [18].
• Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is an ML
algorithm, which produces a prediction model in the form
of an ensemble of weak prediction models (decision
trees). Gradient Boosting learns from the residual error
(directly), rather than update the weights of data points
[19].
In a nutshell, Table I indicates the advantages and
disadvantages of all mentioned machine leaning models.

B. Performance evaluation
In the presented study, we split the data images into a
training and testing image set. We use 75% of the data as the
training data for training the model, the next 25% remaining
data were used as testing data. Moreover, all considered
models were evaluated by taking advantage of the well-known
performance criteria and Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) [21].
According to the confusion matrix, the formulas for these
measurements are described briefly as follows.

A. Data description
This paper evaluates all described models mentioned in the
previous section based on two datasets. The first data set
includes image data on 430 patients infected with COVID-19.
Also, 550 healthy (normal) individuals were randomly
selected from the second data set [20]. The following Figure

In our experiment, each test set is executed with six
different machine learning algorithms. By using the values in
the confusion matrix, 5 different statistics (in Equations. (1–
5)) are calculated to measure the efficiency of the algorithms.
In this study, the architecture of MLP designed as five fully
connected layers with 350, 250,150,50 and 2 number of
neurons in each layer, respectively. Except for the last layer,
the rectified linear unit (Relu) used in considered MLP
network and the last layer use "softmax" activation, which
means it will return an array of 2 probability scores (Positive
or Negative). In addition, the architecture of CNN designed
as four convolution layers with a convolution kernel size of
7x7 to extract the features and each them uses 3x3 average
pooling layer or max pooling to prevent the features. The
number of convolution in each convolution layer is at least
64. After the max pooling layer, two 512-dimensional fully
connected layer are added, along with dropout layer in order
to prevent overfitting problem. In Table II, the results show
that SVM outperforms the other models. The Table includes
the performance of CNN which has provided a 97% accuracy
rate. In addition, it is reported an 99% accuracy for the SVM
model. Sine image-based diagnosis SVM model has to deal
with nonlinear pattern of data, we considered RBF kernel for
SVM. Furthermore, the confusion matrix for the considered
learning models is constructed in Table III.
