SUMMARY

29

The novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2020 worldwide

30

coronavirus pandemic. Antibody testing is useful for diagnosing historic infections of a

31

disease in a population. These tests are also a helpful epidemiological tool for predicting how

32

the virus spreads in a community, relating antibody levels to immunity and for assessing herd

33

immunity. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were recombinantly produced

34

and used to analyse serum from individuals previously exposed, or not, to SARS-CoV-2. The

35

nucleocapsid (Npro) and Spike subunit 2 (S2Frag) proteins were identified as highly

36

immunogenic, although responses to the former were generally greater. These two proteins

37

were used to develop two quantitative ELISA assays that when used in combination resulted

38

in a highly reliable diagnostic test. Npro and S2Frag-ELISAs could detect at least 10% more

39

true positive COVID-19 cases than the commercially available ARCHITECT test (Abbott).

40

Moreover, our quantitative ELISAs also show that specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2

41

proteins tend to wane rapidly even in patients that had developed severe disease. As antibody

42

tests complement COVID-19 diagnosis and determine population-level surveillance during

43

this pandemic, the alternative diagnostic we present in this study could play a role in

44

controlling the spread of the virus.

INTRODUCTION

47

SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging member of the Coronaviridae (CoV) family, responsible

48

for the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It was first identified in December

49

2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, People’s Republic of China, after several individuals

50

developed severe pneumonia similar to that caused by SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for

51

the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia [1, 2]. Person-to-person transmission of the virus resulted in

52

rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. More than one year later, the World Health

53

Organization (WHO) reported that SARS-CoV-2 was responsible for more than 130 million

54

infections and 2.8 million deaths around the world [3].

55

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded positive-sense

56

RNA. The virus attaches to pulmonary cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-

57

2) receptor mediated by a glycoprotein expressed on its surface, the Spike protein (Spro) [4].

58

Fusion of the viral membrane with the lumen of the endosomal membrane leads to

59

endocytosis, facilitating infection via entry of the viral RNA into the cytosol. During the

60

intracellular viral life cycle, two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, are translated. Sixteen

61

non-structural proteins (nsp) are co-translationally and post-translationally released from

62

pp1a and pp1ab upon proteolytic activity of two virus proteases, the papain-like protease

63

(PLpro) and the 3C-like protease. These proteins are responsible for the establishment of the

64

viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) which is crucial for virus replication inside

65

the cells [5].

66

Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can take from one to 14 days to develop

67

symptoms, which range from mild to severe. Common symptoms associated with infection

68

include fever, dry cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, aches and pains and diarrhoea.

69

However, infection in a high proportion of individuals can lead to severe acute respiratory

70

syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which usually require

71

intensive care. The most severe cases can lead to death [6, 7].

72

Acute COVID-19 diagnosis mainly relies on real-time reverse transcription

73

polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or RT loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT–

74

LAMP) testing of respiratory secretions [8]. In the context of the recent virus variants, whole

75

genome sequencing can also be performed to determine the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2

76

virus in a sample [9]. Antigen-Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Tests (Ag-RDTs) were developed

77

and have been successfully applied to detect the presence of viral antigens, typically using

78

samples from the respiratory tract to increase the sensitivity of the test [10]. Computed

79

tomography (CT) scans can also be performed and show bilateral multilobular ground-glass

80

opacities which aid in diagnosis. Part of the strategy to identify those exposed to infection

81

and with an established immune response includes serological tests to detect antibodies to

82

SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and serological testing can be used in combination,

83

which was demonstrated to significantly increase the viral detection rates [8, 11].

84

In general, it takes several days for individuals to build an immune response to the

85

virus. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens are detectable in less than 40% of patients within

86

one week of the onset of symptoms, but rapidly increase in the following days [12, 13].

87

Longitudinal studies are necessary to characterize the longevity of the antibodies in

88

convalescent individuals and to determine if these confer protective immunity [13, 14], and

89

more specifically, to identify which antigen(s) this immunity is directed towards [15, 16].

90

This knowledge is critical to assess the epidemiological context of the COVID-19 pandemic

91

and for the differentiation between exposed and non-exposed individuals to define the

92

locality and distribution of infection that can guide pandemic control measures such as social

93

distancing. It is also important for vaccine design and the evaluation of vaccine candidates.

94

SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are widely used for surveillance studies to gather

95

information about infectivity of the virus in a population. Existing commercial SARS-CoV-2

96

antibody tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), chemiluminescence

97

immunoassays and lateral flow assays, were developed using specific viral antigens,

98

principally the Nucleocapsid protein (Npro) and the Spike protein (Spro). The manufacturers

99

of several commercial tests assert that these tests have sensitivities between 86.3 and 100%

100

and specificities from 97 to 100%. However, recent studies that have evaluated the accuracy

101

of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys have reported reduced sensitivities. For

102

example, Schnurra et al. [17] compared the performance of eight different commercial tests

103

and concluded that at least four of them were slightly less sensitive than specified by the

104

manufacturers. Similarly, evaluations made by Public Health England (PHE) found that one

105

in five people with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in an antibody test used in UK could be

106

wrongly told that they had the infection [18, 19]. Considering the highlighted problems with

107

sensitivity and the limited data regarding the immune response of those individuals beyond

108

35 days post-symptom onset, such results need to be carefully interpreted by public health

109

authorities [20].

110

Timely and accurate diagnosis and identification of an immune response to SARS-

111

CoV-2 infection is the foundation of efforts to provide appropriate treatment and recommend

112

isolation that ultimately can contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Npro and Spro-based tests

113

were observed to react with different sets of sera and, therefore, using a combination of viral

114

antigens to assess the antibody response could represent a strategy to increase the accuracy of

115

identifying true positives [17]. In the present study we demonstrate how the current

116

serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 can be improved by using two highly immunogenic

117

virus proteins, Npro and the S2 subdomain of Spro (S2Frag), in a dual ELISA test to detect

118

specific antibody responses to the virus.

122

In the present study, the full length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (Spro, ~135 kDa) and four

123

different sections, Spike protein fragment 1 (S1frag, 1-686, ~75 kDa), Spike protein fragment

124

2 (S2frag, 687-1273, ~54 kDa), the Spike protein fragment 2 prime region (S2Prime, 816-

125

1273, ~38 kDa) and the receptor binding domain (RBD, 319-542, ~29 kDa) were selected for

126

recombinant expression (Fig 1A and B) (see also [15]). The entire Npro sequence (2-1269; 50

127

kDa) was synthesised for recombinant expression (Fig 1C).

128
129

Recombinant expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in Escherichia coli

130

Sequences encoding the spike protein were codon optimized for expression in Escherichia

131

coli and cloned into the pET-28a(+) vector, and into pET-19b for nucleocapsid protein

132

(Genscript Biotech). While Npro contains an N-terminal His-Tag followed by an

133

enterokinase cleavage site, all other proteins contain a thrombin cleavage site followed by a

134

C-terminal His-tag. The synthesized vectors were transformed into BL21 competent E. coli

135

cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions and stored in Luria

136

Bertani (LB) broth (Sigma) supplemented with 25% glycerol at -80°C. LB broth

137

supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin, or 100 µg/mL ampicillin for Npro, was inoculated

138

from the glycerol stock and incubated shaking at 37°C overnight. The culture was then

139

diluted in fresh LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic, incubated at 37°C to

140

OD600 0.6 and protein expression induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside

141

(IPTG; ThermoFisher Scientific) for 4 hr at 30°C. For Npro the cultures were induced with

142

0.5 mM IPTG for 3 hr at 37°C. Following centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C, the

143

bacterial pellets were re-suspended in 10 mL ST buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0)

144

and stored at -20 °C.

Solubilisation and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins

147

Defrosted pellets were treated with 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme in the presence of 40 mM DTT for

148

1 hr on ice. The proteins in inclusion bodies were solubilised according the protocol

149

described by Schlager et al. [21] protocol. Firstly, a 1% (w/v) SDS buffer (8 mM Na2HPO4,

150

286 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, 2.6 mM KCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM

151

DTT was added to the pellets, which were then sonicated twice for 2 min, 40% amplitude.

152

The samples were centrifuged 15,000 x g at 4°C for 30 min and the resulting supernatant was

153

filtered using 0.45 μm syringe filters. The filtered supernatant containing the soluble

154

recombinant protein was passed through a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads column (Qiagen).

155

The column was washed with 30 mL of wash buffer (8 mM Na2HPO4, 286 mM NaCl, 1.4

156

mM KH2PO4, 2.6 mM KCl, 0.1% Sarkosyl (w/v), 40 mM imidazole, pH 7.4), and the

157

recombinant protein was eluted using 4 mL of elution buffer (8 mM Na2HPO4, 286 mM

158

NaCl, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, 2.6 mM KCl, 0.1% Sarkosyl (w/v), 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The

159

purified protein was buffer-exchanged into 1x PBS containing 0.05% sarkosyl, pH 7.4.

160

Recombinant and soluble Npro was extracted from E. coli by sonicating twice for 2

161

min, 20% amplitude (1 g cells: 5 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCL, 1 mM EDTA,

162

10% (v/v) glycerol pH 8.0, with 1 mM PMSF and 4 μg/mL leupeptin), followed by

163

centrifugation and dialysis into 20 mM H2NaPO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 7.4.

164

The samples were centrifuged and filtered using 0.45 μm syringe filters, prior to application

165

to HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer. After extensive column

166

washing, bound Npro was eluted with 20 mM H2NaPO4, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole

167

pH 7.4. Npro was stored in the elution buffer.

168

Protein concentrations were verified by Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and the

169

proteins visualised on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) stained with Biosafe Coomassie

170

(Bio-Rad) to check purity. To further confirm the expression and purification of the

171

recombinant proteins, Western blots were performed using a monoclonal mouse anti-

172

polyhistidine antibody (diluted 1:5,000) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a primary antibody followed by

173

incubation with a secondary antibody alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-

174

conjugated goat to mouse-anti-IgG (diluted 1:5000) (Sigma-Aldrich). Furthermore, the

175

veracity of both S2Frag and Npro recombinant proteins was confirmed by high sensitivity

176

protein mass spectrometry analysis using a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher)

177

prior to use for ELISA development [22].

179

Human sera samples

180

Negative controls consisted of a group of 37 serum samples obtained from the Irish Blood

181

Transfusion Service. All the samples were collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2018)

182

and stored at -20oC.

183

Human serum samples were obtained from St. James’s Hospital, Trinity College

184

Dublin with informed consent. The first set comprised 42 serum samples collected from

185

healthcare workers and all individuals were confirmed to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection by

186

qRT-PCR. All individuals developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and four subjects

187

were hospitalized. The group consisted of 29 females and 13 males, ranging from 27 to 64

188

years old (average 41.5). The samples were obtained between 17 to 40 days post symptoms

189

onset.

190

A second set consisted of samples collected from 98 healthcare workers with potential

191

exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This group was divided into symptomatic (N= 49) and

192

asymptomatic (N= 49) individuals. Of the 49 symptomatic individuals, only four were

193

confirmed to have a SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. One of these individuals was

194

hospitalized and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The other 45 individuals were not

195

tested by qRT-PCR because of the number of days after onset of symptoms >7 days. The

196

symptomatic group consisted of 37 female and 12 male individuals, ranging from 23 to 63

197

years old. The samples were collected between 16 and 113 days after onset of symptoms. The

198

asymptomatic group was formed by 26 females and 23 males, ranging from 22 to 64 years

199

old. Seven individuals in this group were tested doe SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR due

200

to close contact status tested and were all given negative results.

201

Plasma samples from individuals hospitalized with or without COVID-19 related

202

symptoms were obtained. This group consisted of 25 patients, 13 females and 12 males

203

(between 35 to 89 years old), and was divided into qRT-PCR positive (N=15) and qRT-PCR

204

negative (N=10). The plasma samples were collected between 0 and 65 days after onset of

205

symptoms. Two plasma samples, at different time-points, were obtained and analysed from

206

those 15 qRT-PCR positive patients. Of the 15 positive individuals, seven were admitted to

207

the ICU (2 females and 5 males, ranging from 50 to 73 years old). Seven individuals required

208

invasive ventilation. One of the individuals died (male, 79 years old).

209

Human experimental work was conducted according to Human Research Ethics

210

Committees. Ethical approval for the healthcare worker serum sample collection and analysis

211

was granted by the St. James’s Hospital and Tallaght University Hospital research ethics

Western Blot assays

220

Purified recombinant proteins (~2.5 µg/lane) were resolved in a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel

221

(BioRad) and transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated in

222

blocking solution (2% BSA-PBST) at 4°C, overnight, then probed with human sera diluted

223

1:100 in 2% BSA-PBST for 1 hr at room temperature. The membrane was washed four times

224

in PBST before incubation with the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-Human

225

IgG (Fc specific) diluted 1:15000 in 2% BSA-PBST, for 1 hr at RT. The blots were

226

developed for 3 min using 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich).

227
228

Dual antigen SARS-CoV-2 ELISA development

229

For the dual ELISA tests, separated flat-bottom 96 well microtitre plates (Nunc MaxiSorp,

230

Biolegend) were coated with either Npro (1 µg/mL) or S2Frag (1 µg/mL) diluted in carbonate

231

buffer and incubated overnight at 4ºC. The plates were incubated with blocking buffer (2%

232

BSA in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 (v/v), PBST, pH 7.4) and washed. Individual sera samples,

233

diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer, were added in duplicate to antigen-coated wells and

234

incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. After washing five times with PBST, the secondary antibody HRP

235

goat anti-human IgG (Fc specific) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added (1:15,000), and the plates were

236

incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. After washing five times, TMB substrate (3,3′,5,5′-

237

Tetramethylbenzidine Liquid Substrate Supersensitive, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each

238

well. Following a three-minute incubation the reaction was stopped with 2 N sulphuric acid

239

and plates read at 450 nm in a plate reader (PolarStar). The background value was discounted

240

from the blanks and a cut-off (CO) value for each ELISA test was calculated from the

241

average of all the negative control samples plus three standard deviations. The average OD

242

(450 nm) obtained for each sample tested was divided by the cut-off of the test. Values >1

243

were considered SARS-CoV-2 positive in the test. Values <1 were negative SARS-CoV-2 in

244

the test. Data were analysed using Prism 5 (Graphpad).

250

Plasma samples of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection

251

were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies to Npro and S2Frag using our dual SARS-

252

CoV-2 ELISA assays (see section above). Individual plasma samples, diluted 1:100 in

253

blocking buffer, were added in duplicate into antigen-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at

254

37°C. The ELISA assays were developed as described above. The average OD (450 nm)

255

obtained for each sample tested was divided by the cut-off calculated for the test. Values > 1

256

were considered SARS-CoV-2 positive in the test. Values <1 were negative SARS-CoV-2 in

259

Statistical analyses

260

Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5. Differences between

261

negative controls and positive controls were analysed using an unpaired t-test. Correlation

262

between Npro and S2Frag ELISA tests or Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA

263

test and our ELISA tests were aanalysed using Spearman’s rank test with 95% confidence

RESULTS

267

Isolation and solubilisation of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins

268

Recombinant proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 cells; however, spike

269

protein and its various subunits were associated with insoluble inclusion bodies. By

270

employing a protocol using 1% SDS the inclusion bodies were solubilised and the various

271

proteins purified at ~1 mg/L of culture (Fig 2). The solubilisation and isolation of S2Frag is

272

shown in Fig 2A and B. Residual insoluble Npro was present in post-lysis recombinant E.

273

ELISA antibody test using Npro and S2Frag distinguishes positive and negative SARS-

279

CoV-2 infected individuals

280

As part of the development and optimization of the in-house ELISA developed with the

281

recombinant Npro and S2Frag, an appropriate cut-off point for each antigen was established

282

using 37 negative control human samples collected pre-COVID-19 pandemic (in 2018).

283

Then, 42 SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positive samples were screened using both Npro-ELISA

284

and S2Frag-ELISA. This screening showed that all 42 individuals assessed generated

285

significant levels of IgG antibodies against both Npro and S2Frag proteins (Fig 3). Notably,

286

infected individuals showed an average antibody response to Npro that was consistently

287

higher than the reactivity against S2Frag. Notwithstanding, both Npro and S2Frag could be

288

employed to distinguish positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.

289

Examining the performance of the Npro-ELISA, we deemed 36 (85.7%) samples as

290

positive infected individuals. When these samples were tested with the S2Frag ELISA assay,

291

37 (88%) positive samples were identified. However, by combining the results of both

292

ELISA tests, the number of positive samples was 40 (95.2%) because not all individuals

293

produced antibodies against both Npro and S2Frag (Fig 4A, Table 1).

294

Serum samples from 98 healthcare workers suspected of exposure to SARS-CoV-2

295

were also screened in both ELISAs. Of these, 12 (12.2%) were detected as positive using

296

only the Npro ELISA (Fig 4B and Table 1) while 14 (14.3%) were deemed positive when the

297

S2Frag ELISA results were considered together with the results of the Npro ELISA.

Western blot analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive serum samples

300

Western blot analysis using purified recombinant Npro and S2Frag proteins was performed

301

on all serum samples. This analysis confirmed infectivity of all individuals that were deemed

302

positive by ELISA. However, a wide range of reactivity was observed between patients,

303

which correlated with our ELISA observations showing that some patients produced

antibodies reactive with both Npro and S2Frag while others produced antibodies that reacted

305

with either Npro or S2Frag (see Fig 5 for representative Western blots).

306
307

Comparison of the Npro and S2Frag ELISAs with a commercially available antibody

308

test

309

In order to assess the sensitivity of the Npro and S2Frag ELISA tests against a commercially

310

available test, serum samples were tested in parallel using the Abbott ARCHITECT ELISA

311

(ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2) which employs Npro as its antigen (Fig 6). Using the 42 qRT-

312

PCR-confirmed positive serum samples, the data showed complete agreement between the

313

Abbott ARCHITECT and the Npro ELISA test developed in this study (i.e. 85.4%

314

sensitivity) (Fig 6A). However, four patients that were negative and two that were positive by

315

both these tests showed a contrasting result when evaluated by the S2Frag-ELISA (Fig 6B).

316

Combining the data for the Npro-ELISA and S2Frag-ELISA tests increased the sensitivity of

317

detection to 95.2% (Table 1).

318

When the ARCHITECT test was employed to screen plasma samples from the 98

319

healthcare workers suspected of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 only six (6.1%) of these samples

320

proved positive for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, 14 (14.3%) individuals were identified as

321

positive using our in-house ELISA tests (Fig 6C and D and Table 1).

322
323

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in COVID-19 hospitalized patients

324

Plasma samples from COVID-19 hospitalized patients were tested for specific antibodies

325

against our in-house Npro and S2Frag-ELISA tests. Two samples of each patient, at different

326

time-points after the onset of symptoms, were assessed and compared for their levels of

327

antibodies against Npro and S2Frag (Fig 7). The data shows that COVID-19 hospitalized

328

individuals develop strong antibody response to both Npro and S2Frag. However, the level of

329

antibody to each antigen is very distinct. The OD/CO values obtained to the Npro were

330

consistently higher than to the S2Frag (Medium OD/CO Npro= 8.46 and S2Frag= 2.09).

331

Moreover, antibodies to Npro could be detected from day seven after onset of symptoms,

332

whilst antibodies to S2Frag were only detected from day 11 (Supplementary Table S1).

333

Nevertheless, from day 15 after onset of symptoms, all individuals assessed showed strong

334

antibody response to both SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

335

When considering the number of days after onset of symptoms in relation to the

336

OD/CO values, our data show that COVID-19 patients reached their highest antibody levels

337

to virus antigens between day 15 and 21 after onset of symptoms. Surprisingly, from day 22

338

the antibody responses to both Npro and S2frag begin to decline (Fig 7A and B). Since the

339

S2Frag stimulates a weaker response, specific antibodies to this antigen dropped to levels

340

close to the cut-off of the test within approximately seven weeks; the average S2Frag OD/CO

341

values for the first plasma samples obtained between days 15-21 and between 28-35 were

342

3.64 and 1.34, respectively. These values varied less when we assessed the responses to

343

Npro; OD/CO values varied from 12.67 to 12.2 when the same intervals were considered

344

(Supplementary Table S1).

345
346

DISCUSSION

347

Individuals infected with coronaviruses mount an immune response with protective

348

neutralizing antibodies for a period of time [23]. Recent studies have shown that neutralizing

349

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be detected in all infected individuals by day 14 after

350

onset of symptoms [8, 24]. Both the Spro and Npro are highly immunogenic structural

351

proteins capable of generating such an antibody response [13, 25-27]. Upon infection, the

352

Spro is readily presented to the host as part of the invasion process. In contrast, the Npro

353

integrates with the host cell nucleus and nucleolus and is abundantly expressed during

354

infection, playing important roles in the transcription and replication of viral RNA and

355

packaging of the encapsulated genome into virions [28, 29].

356

Since the start of the COVID-19 global pandemic, Spro and Npro have been

357

extensively used to develop the antibody tests to diagnose past-infection by SARS-CoV-2. As

358

antibody tests identify historic infections, they are a highly prized tool for epidemiological

359

studies that track the spread of the virus within the community and for estimating herd

360

immunity. However, independent and more extensive assessment of these tests has

361

highlighted serious issues with their sensitivity that result in up to 20% false negativity [17,

362

18].

363

It has been shown that antibodies targeted against Npro appear earlier than those

364

against Spro [30], offering an explanation as to why Npro is the antigen of choice in most

365

commercially available tests. To understand how individuals naturally infected with SARS-

366

CoV-2 respond to the main viral antigens, six viral proteins were recombinantly expressed:

367

the full-length Spro and four different sub-segments, i.e. S1Frag, S2Frag, S2Prime and RBD

368

(Fig 1), and the Npro. Through Western blot analysis, variability in the immune response to

369

each antigen between individuals was observed (Supplementary Fig S2). At least 85% of the

370

COVID-19 positive individuals tested in this study showed a consistent and strong antibody

371

response to Npro. However, our data shows that 7% of the COVID-19 non-hospitalized

372

individuals confirmed positive by qRT-PCR were misdiagnosed as negative when using

373

either our in-house Npro-ELISA or the commercial ARCHITECT test, demonstrating that

374

some individuals do not produce antibodies to Npro or, alternatively, had not produced these

375

at the time of sampling.

376

Despite previous reports stating that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spro

377

is highly immunogenic and the target of many neutralizing antibodies, the RBD protein

378

produced in this study was not immunogenic (Supplementary Fig S2) [31-33]. It is worth

379

noting that our antigens were recombinantly produced using a prokaryotic E. coli system,

380

while the immunogenic recombinant RBD produced by Amanat et al. [15] was expressed in

381

mammalian cells. This could have resulted in proteins with different antigenic properties that

382

affect the ability of host antibodies to recognize the antigen. Nevertheless, our study agrees

383

with Robbiani et al. [34], who observed that convalescent plasma samples from individuals

384

who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of RBD-specific neutralizing

385

antibodies.

386

Conversely, the full-length Spro was consistently recognized by antibodies from

387

individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 [32, 35, 36]. Although the subdomain S1 protein

388

(S1Frag), containing the RBD, is the most common fragment of the Spro used in commercial

389

serological tests, our study found that a stronger immune response was directed against the

390

subdomain S2 protein (S2Frag); 38 of the 42 (90.5%) individuals that were SARS-CoV-2

391

RT-PCR-positive elicited antibodies to the S2Frag, indicating the diagnostic value of the

392

domain. However, based on the OD/CO values obtained, COVID-19 hospitalized and non-

393

hospitalized positive individuals mounted stronger immune response against Npro, indicating

394

that S2Frag is less immunogenic.

395

It was reported that during COVID-19 infection a decrease in the number of viral

396

particles coincides with the appearance of neutralizing antibodies [37], although the longevity

397

of such antibodies is debatable. Antibody titres to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated

398

to remain elevated for variable periods, seven days to more than 48 days, and serve to protect

399

the individual against reinfection [8, 24]. In our study we found that infected individuals did

400

not sustain high antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens for long periods, and even

401

individuals that developed severe disease and required intensive care exhibited antibody

402

declines, mainly those specific to S2Frag, after three weeks (Fig 7 A and B and

403

Supplementary Table S1). As both anti-Spro and anti-Npro IgG antibodies have been

404

observed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [38], our tests may be of use for assessing protection

405

after infection or immunization.

406

By performing a dual ELISA with Npro and S2Frag we detected anti-viral antibodies

407

in 40 out of 42 PCR-positive individuals. Follow-up Western Blot analysis of the two

408

negative samples by ELISA, indicated that one individual had no antibodies against the viral

409

antigens (Study code C11, supplementary Fig S4), whilst the second patient had only a weak

410

response to S2Frag (Study code C86, supplementary Fig S4). The results obtained for C11

411

suggest that the patient received a false-positive qRT-PCR result, though it is important to

412

consider that little is known about seroconversion during SARS-CoV-2 infection. While

413

some patients may seroconvert, others might develop low antibody titres that wane within a

414

short period of time, generating false-negative results [15]. On the other hand, the analytical

415

sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR tests is 80% [39, 40], leaving a large potential for false

416

negative results that we certainly observed in our study. Among the ten SARS-CoV-2 qRT-

417

PCR negative hospitalized patients we evaluated, four tested positive for antibodies to Npro

418

and/or S2Frag in our ELISAs (Supplementary Table S1). Our results indicate that targeting

419

the antibody response against both Npro and S2Frag in serological diagnostic tests increases

420

the sensitivity of detection of true positive SARS-CoV-2 infection and, therefore, represents

421

an important strategy to improve COVID-19 diagnosis.

422

Our ELISAs results also revealed that ~17% of the 42 qRT-PCR-positive individuals

423

recognize either Npro or S2Frag antigen only; ~7% of the individuals exclusively recognized

424

Npro while 10% only recognised S2Frag alone (Fig 4A). These antigen-selective immune

425

responses were confirmed using Western blot analysis (Fig 5). A similar observation was

426

reported by Liu et al. [35], who evaluated the IgM and IgG antibody responses of 214

427

COVID-19 positive patients; Npro- or Spro-based ELISA resulted in positive rates of 80.4%

428

and 82.2%, respectively, whereas together these detected 86.9% (186 patients). While these

429

results indicate the diagnostic value of the antigens association, the differential reactivity of

430

the serum samples with Npro and Spro was not assessed in that particular study [35].

431

When we analysed the antibody response of 15 patients that were hospitalized with

432

COVID-19 we found that the Npro OD/CO values for ICU and non-ICU patients were 10.34

433

and 6.82 (P < 0.05), respectively (Supplementary Table S1), while the values for S2Frag did

434

not vary significantly between each group (OD/CO = 1.93 and 2.22, respectively). Sun et al.

435

[41] also found that anti-Npro IgG antibodies were significantly higher in ICU patients

436

compared to non-ICU patients. Therefore, anti-Npro antibodies could be an indicator of

437

disease severity, although we did not find a correlation between antibody levels and age of

438

the patients in our study (Supplementary Fig S3).

439

In the present study, we compared our ELISAs results with the commercially-

440

available immunoassay ARCHITECT (Abbott), which detects antibody response solely to

441

Npro. The results of our in-house Npro-ELISA agreed 100% with the ARCHITECT test

442

when we screened the 42 qRT-PCR positive sample set. However, only 6 of the 98 healthcare

443

workers suspected of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were deemed positive by ARCHITECT test,

444

compared to 12 identified using our Npro-ELISA. This discrepancy rose to 14 when we

445

employed the Npro and S2Frag dual ELISA, results which were confirmed by Western Blot

446

analysis (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig S4). A recent longitudinal seroprevalence study found

447

a 95% prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in two hospitals in Ireland

448

who had previously confirmed infection by PCR. Moreover, 16% of those with detectable

449

antibodies reported never having experienced COVID-19 symptoms. Noteworthy, the study

450

used primarily ARCHTECT test that was complemented with the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 AB

451

ELISA (Fortress Diagnostics) and the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, improving the

452

detection of positive cases and revealing that the real seroprevalence amongst the hospitals’

453

workers is between 2 and 5% higher than the number given by PCR diagnosis [11]. The

454

importance of the diagnostic methods applied was further assessed by Rikhtegaran Tehrani et

455

al. [36], which investigated 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19

456

samples using commercial tests such as EDI™ Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA,

457

Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and PP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System. This study

458

found that their in-house Spro and Npro-based ELISAs performed with the highest sensitivity

459

and specificity. In all, our results indicate that our in-house quantitative ELISA performs

460

better than the non-quantitative ARCHITECT tests using a single Npro protein and can be

461

improved by running the dual ELISA assay with S2Frag.

CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 serological testing in clinical settings relies on ELISA assays, which can

465

be both qualitative and quantitative and thus a valuable tool in diagnosing past such

466

infections [40]. However, the preference for rapid tests and the deficient performance of most

467

commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological tests may pose a serious risk to diagnostic

468

efficacy [8, 17, 18]. Therefore, quantitative ELISA tests such as those developed in this study

469

could be essential to understand the dynamic of individual antibody response to the virus and,

470

consequently, plan appropriate measures of control during the COVID-19 pandemic.

471

In this study we evaluated two ELISA tests for detecting IgG antibodies to Npro and

472

to the subdomain 2 of the Spro (S2Frag), and showed that by combining the tests we can

473

improve the serological diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we showed the

474

applicability of the tests using plasma samples from hospitalized patients. Quantitative

475

ELISA tests would allow us to assess antibody levels that are associated with protection or

476

indicate a more recent or historic infection. As serological diagnostics of COVID-19 patients

477

determine population-level surveillance and complement qRT-PCR and antigen tests, the

478

optimization of antibody tests is critical to control the COVID-19 pandemic.
