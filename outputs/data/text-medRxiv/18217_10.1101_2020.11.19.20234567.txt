Abstract
Background
HLA class I molecules play a crucial role in the development of a specific immune
response to viral infections by presenting viral peptides to cell surface where they will
be further recognized by T cells. In the present manuscript we explored whether HLA
class I genotype can be associated with critical course of COVID-19 by searching
possible connections between genotypes of deceased patients and their age at death.
Methods and Findings
HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genotypes of n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19
(Moscow, Russia) and n = 428 volunteers were identified with targeted next-generation
sequencing. Deceased patients were splitted into two groups according to age at death:
n = 26 adult patients with age at death below 60 completed years (inclusively) and
n = 85 elderly patients over 60. With the use of HLA class I genotypes we developed a
risk score which is associated with the ability to present SARS-CoV-2 peptides by an
individual’s HLA class I molecule set. The resulting risk score was significantly higher
in the group of deceased adults compared to elderly adults (p = 0.00348, AUC
ROC = 0.68). In particular, presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele was associated with high
risk, while HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 mainly contributed to the low risk group.
The analysis of homozygous patients highlighted the results even stronger:
homozygosity by HLA-A*01:01 mainly accompanied early deaths, while only one
HLA-A*02:01 homozygote died before 60.
Conclusions
The obtained results suggest the important role of HLA class I peptide presentation in
the development of a specific immune response to COVID-19. While prediction of age
at death by HLA class I genotype had a reliable performance, involvement of HLA class
II genotype can make it even higher in the future studies.

Introduction

1

HLA class I molecules are one of the key mediators of the first links in the development
of a specific immune response to COVID-19 infection. Right after entering the cell
SARS-CoV-2 induces the translation of its proteins. Some of these proteins enter the
proteasomes of the infected cell, get cleaved to peptides of the length 8-12 amino acid
residues and bind to HLA class I receptors. After binding the complex consisting of the
HLA class I molecule and the peptide is transferred to the surface of the infected cell,
where it can interact with the T cell receptor of CD8+ T lymphocytes. In response to
the interaction the CD8+ T lymphocyte activates and starts to divide; in 5-7 days a
population of virus-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes capable of destroying
infected cells using perforins and serine proteases gets formed [1].
There are three main types of HLA class I receptors: HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C.
Receptors of every type are present in two variants inherited from parents. There exist
dozens of variants of each allele of HLA-I receptors; every allele has an individual ability
to recognize various foreign proteins. The distribution of alleles is population/country
specific [2].
Individual combinations of HLA class I receptors essentially affect the severity of
multiple infectious diseases, including malaria [3], tuberculosis [4], HIV [5] and viral
hepatitis [2]. There is a number of reported interconnections between the HLA genotype
and sensitivity to SARS-CoV. E.g. the alleles HLA-B*07:03 [6], HLA-B*46:01 [7] and
HLA-C*08:01 [8] are factors of predisposition to a severe form of the disease; the allele
HLA-C*15:02 is associated with a mild form [9].
Information on the interconnection of HLA class I genotype and severity of the
course of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is sparse.
A sample of 45 patients with varying severity of COVID-19 was used to confirm the
results of theoretical modeling of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 peptides with various
HLA-I alleles [10]. It was demonstrated that the number of peptides with a high
interaction constant is connected with individual HLA genotype: the more viral peptides
with high affinity bind to HLA class I, the easier is the course of the disease. It was also
shown that the frequency of the occurrence of HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-A*02:01 alleles is
related to the number of infections and mortality rate in different regions of Italy [11].
In the present study we explored whether HLA class I genotype can be a factor
contributing to the critical course of COVID-19. For that we performed HLA
genotyping for n = 111 deceased patients with COVID-19 as well as the control group
(n = 428), and searched for putative associations between genotypes and age at death.
Since the total number of distinct HLA class I genotypes is too high for performing
frequency-based analysis, we assigned scores to each allele based on capability of
presenting SARS-CoV-2 peptides. The obtained scores allowed us to make valid
statistical comparison of HLA genotypes in groups of deceased adults (age at death not
greater than 60 completed years, n = 26), elderly adults (age at death over 60, n = 85)
and the control. Special attention was paid to “extreme” cases formed by individuals
homozygous by some of HLA genes. Additionally, we assessed the contribution of each
viral protein to the constructed risk model.

or bronchoalveolar lavage. Patients with pathologies that lead to greater morbidity or
who had additional immunosuppression (HIV, active cancer in treatment with
chemotherapy, immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases with immunosuppressants,
transplant patient) were not included in the study. Blood (2 ml) was collected by the
medical practitioner from the right ventricle in an EDTA vial post-mortem. Patients
were divided into two groups according to their age of death: adults (age ≤ 60, n = 26)
and elderly adults (age > 60, n = 85).
The control group of 428 volunteers was established with the use of electronic HLA
genotype records of the Federal register of bone marrow donors (Pirogov Russian
National Research Medical University). All patients or their next of kin gave informed
consent for participation in the study.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Local Ethics Committee at
the Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (Meeting No. 194 of March
16 2020, Protocol No. 2020/07); the study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen-collected anticoagulated whole blood samples
by using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit on the automatic workstation QIACube
(QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes were
sequenced with MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) through exons 2 to 4 in
both directions using reagent kit HLA-Expert (DNA-Technology LLC, Moscow, Russia)
and annotated using the database of the human major histocompatibility complex
sequences IMGT/HLA v3.41.0 [12]. Processed genotype data is available in S1 Table.

Publicly available SARS-CoV-2 proteomes derived from patients infected in Moscow
(n = 79) were obtained from GISAID [13] (full list of IDs is presented within S2 Table).
Clustal Omega v1.2.4 was used to construct multiple sequence alignment for each viral
protein [14]. The obtained alignment had no gaps and rare mutations: only 117 out of
9719 positions (1.2%) contained more than one amino acid variant. Moreover,
distribution of non-major amino acid fractions at mutation sites was also concentrated
near zero: maximum fraction was equal to 22.8% (18 out of 79 viruses), 0.95 quantile
was equal to 5.1% (4 viruses) and upper quartile was equal to 1.3% (one virus with
mismatched amino acid).
Since many research groups use the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome and proteome
sequences (Wuhan-Hu-1, NCBI Reference Sequence: NC 045512.2) we compared the
obtained alignment with the mentioned reference. Two protein sequences differed in
four positions (0.04%) located within NSP12, N and S viral proteins. Such differences
can indeed lead to functional diversity of analyzed proteins, however will be totally
negligible for the further analysis.

taking all possible 8-mers to 12-mers having proteasomal cleavage probability not less
than 0.1 at both ends of a sequence.
Binding affinities were predicted using netMHCpan v4.1 [17] for all viral peptides
(n = 15314) and HLA alleles present in our cohorts of deceased and control patients
(n = 107). Peptides having weak binding affinity to all considered alleles were discarded
(IC50 affinity values above 500 nM as recommended by netMHCpan developers). For
the remaining 6548 peptides all affinities were inverted, multiplied by 500 and
log10 -transformed. Thus, the resulting score was equal to zero for peptides with weak
binding affinity threshold (500 nM) and equal to one for the high binding affinity
(50 nM). Raw and processed matrices are presented in S3 Table.

Allele frequencies in considered cohorts were estimated by dividing the number of
occurrences of a given allele in individuals by the doubled total number of individuals
(i.e. identical alleles of homozygous individuals were counted as two occurences). The
following functions from scipy.stats Python module [18] were used to conduct statistical
testing: fisher exact for Fisher’s exact test, mannwhitneyu for Mann-Whitney U test.
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to perform multiple testing correction.
Principal component analysis was conducted with scikit-learn Python module [19].
Permutation test for assessing significance of area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC ROC) values was done with n = 106 label permutations.
Plots were constructed with Seaborn and Matplotlib [20].

Distribution of HLA class I gene alleles in the cohort of
deceased COVID-19 patients and the control group

We performed HLA class I genotyping for n = 111 deceased patients with confirmed
COVID-19 (Moscow, Russia) and the control group consisting of volunteers (n = 428).
Deceased patients were divided into two groups: adults (age at death less or equal to 60
years) and elderly adults (age at death over 60 years). Demographic and clinical data of
these cohorts is summarized in Table 1. Although patients with severe comorbidities
were excluded from the study, 76.6 % of deceased patients had at least one underlying
disease. Only cerebrovascular disease had statistically significant odds ratio when
comparing groups of adults and elderly adults (3.8% versus 34.1%, Fisher’s exact test
p = 1.89 × 10−3 ). Other cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and heart
failure were also more frequent in group of elders which, however, was not statistically
significant. Interestingly, arterial hypertension was diagnosed in 11.5% adult patients
and 24.7% older adults which was generally less than populational level in Russia (about
50%) [21]. Percentage of diabete cases was about 3.5% in both analyzed groups which is
a typical value for the current population of Russia [22]. Also, frequencies of chronic
kidney disease (stages 4–5) in both groups (23.1% for adults and 16.5% for elders) was
significantly higher compared to background populational value (about 0.05%) [23].
First, we tested whether frequency of a single allele can differentiate individuals from
three groups: adult patients died from COVID-19, elderly patients died from COVID-19
and the control group. Distribution of major HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles in
these three groups is summarized in Fig 1. Fisher’s exact test was used to make formal
statistical comparisons. As a result, we found that for all possible group comparisons
not a single allele had odds ratio which can be considered statistically significant after

Binding affinities of viral peptides to HLA class I molecules

Since sizes of considered cohorts were insufficient for performing frequency analysis at
level of full HLA class I genotypes, we transformed patient genotypes from discrete
space to numerical units associated with the potential of interactions with SARS-CoV-2
peptides. To implement this idea we first constructed a matrix of binding affinities of
viral peptides to HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles. For that we first made
computational predictions of viral peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in
Moscow. Then, binding affinities were calculated for each of predicted peptides and
each allele present in patients from analyzed cohorts.
As a result, we obtained the matrix containing affinity values for 6548 peptides and
107 alleles of genes from major HLA class I. To establish a positive relationship between
values from matrix and binding potential, all affinities were inverted and scaled by value

of 500 nM (the conventional threshold for binding ability). Simultaneous hierarchical
clustering was applied to identify groups of similar peptides and HLA-A, HLA-B and
HLA-C alleles (Fig 2). As can be seen, both alleles and peptides clearly formed several
dense clusters. The most presented alleles of HLA-A (HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01,
HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*24:02) fell in different clusters, while for HLA-B and HLA-C
some major alleles grouped together (e.g. HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01 and
HLA-C*06:02, HLA-C*07:01, HLA-C*07:02).
Note that alleles with similar peptide binding profiles can be linked to different
alleles of remaining genes. For example, consider closely clustered alleles HLA-C*06:02,
HLA-C*07:01 and HLA-C*07:02. From the analysis of the contingency table of allele
pairs in the control group (Fig 3) it follows that each of these alleles has its own
spectrum of associated alleles. Specifically, HLA-C*06:02 usually appears with
HLA-B*13:02 (Fisher’s exact test p = 3.18 × 10−14 ), HLA-C*07:01 is linked to
HLA-A*01:01 (p = 2.97 × 10−7 ) and HLA-B*08:01 (p = 3.15 × 10−14 ), while
HLA-C*07:02 is coupled with HLA-A*03:01 (p = 9.66 × 10−4 ) and HLA-B*07:02
(p = 2.72 × 10−26 ). Interestingly, such linked alleles can have different peptide binding

Risk score based on peptide-HLA binding affinity is associated
with early COVID-19 deaths
For each of considered HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles we obtained the list of
binding affinities to 6548 unique SARS-CoV-2 peptides. In order to calculate aggregate
information on potential of presenting SARS-CoV-2 peptides by each of alleles, we used
principal component analysis (PCA). In this framework 6548-element affinity vectors
are replaced by the most informative linear combinations of their components. For
HLA-A and HLA-C we found four principal components (PCs) each of which explained
at least 5% of data variance, while for HLA-B the number of essential components was
equal to five (S5 Table). Signs of components were set in the way to achieve positive
correlation of component values with age of death of deceased patients.
For each individual, HLA class I gene and PC we summed PC values associated with
two corresponding alleles. After that we analyzed differences of obtained scores in adult
and elderly patients who died from COVID-19. Three of the resulting PCs
demonstrated statistically significant differences according to Mann-Whitney U test.
This list included the second and the third PCs of HLA-A, and the fourth principal
component of HLA-C, while no PCs of HLA-B separated analyzed groups significantly.
As an aggregate risk score (RS) we considered the sum of these three components (for
convenience, we linearly scaled the range of RS to the [0, 100] interval). The obtained
score also significantly separated groups with p = 3.48 × 10−3 (U test) and area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) equal to 0.68 (permutation test
p = 3.10 × 10−3 ), see Fig 4 (full information is listed in S6 Table). Interestingly, the
difference of RS distributions in the cohort of adult patients and the control group was
also statistically significant (U test p = 3.31 × 10−3 ), while the difference between
elderly and control groups was not (p = 0.283).
In order to characterize the association between RS and age at death more precisely,
we partitioned the range of RS into three groups: low, medium and high (Fig 5). The
lower and higher thresholds were calculated in a way to minimize p-value for Fisher’s
exact test applied to the number of adult and elderly patients in the whole cohort and
in the low/high risk groups, respectively. Interestingly, such partitioning led to
significant separation of adult patients both from elderly and control ones in low and
high risk groups, while no significance was found within the middle group (S7 Table).
Then, we performed enrichment analysis to identify alleles significantly contributing

dramatically higher in some of RS groups. Specifically, HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01
were highly overrepresented in low risk and completely absent at high risk groups, while
the most enriched allele in high risk group was HLA-A*01:01. Reciprocally to
HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 cases, not a single individual in low risk group carried
HLA-A*01:01 allele. Complete information on allele frequencies in RS groups is
presented in S1 Fig.
Finally, we assessed the contribution of individual peptides from different viral
proteins to the RS. Contribution of a peptide to RS was calculated as an absolute value
of the sum of corresponding PC coefficients (PC2, PC3 for HLA-A and PC4 for
HLA-C). Then, the set of the most RS contributing peptides was composed by taking
top 5% peptides from the corresponding distribution. The results of the procedure are
summarized in Table 3: distribution of peptides with the strongest contributions over

One-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to identify HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles overrepresented in each of RS groups in
cohorts of deceased and control individuals. Data shown for alleles with p < 0.05 in at least one of cohorts and with frequency
over 5% in at least one of four considered conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 proteins was similar to the one calculated for all peptides after multiple
testing correction. Without the correction, only the nonstructural protein 8 (NSP8) had
a statistically significant odds ratio. Thus, considered peptides were spread over
proteins without any significant dependence on contribution to the RS.

When analyzing the high risk score group we noticed that more than a half (five out of
eight) deceased patients containing HLA-A*01:01 alleles were homozygous by this allele
while the medium group had not a single individual homozygous by HLA-A*01:01
(Fisher’s exact test p = 0.0103). The distribution of individuals homozygous by
HLA-A*01:01 among the groups of deceased patients and the control group proves the
negative role. It turned out that the distribution in the deceased group (4 out of 26
patient who died at the age not greater than 60 and 1 out of 85 patients who died at
the age greater than 60) leads to two statistically significant differences: p-value of
Fisher’s exact test comparing the adults group with the elders group equals 3.10 × 10−3 ,
and p-value of the test comparing the adults group and the control group equals 0.0104
(8 out of 428 members of the control group were homozygous by HLA-A*01:01).
However, the difference between the elders group and the control group is statistically
insignificant (p = 0.155). Interestingly, there were no other statistically significant
differences in the distribution of homozygosity between the groups.
Generally, the average age of death for patients homozygous by any allele was
significantly less compared to heterozygous ones (Mann-Whitney U test
p = 6.45 × 10−3 , S2 Fig). Also the fraction of homozygous patients was higher in the

group of deceased adults (42.3%) compared both to elderly patients (15.3%, Fisher’s
exact test p = 6.03 × 10−3 ) and the control group (19.2%, p = 9.80 × 10−3 ). Difference
between elderly and control groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.448).
However, the low risk group also contained homozygous individuals: all
homozygosity cases by HLA-A*02:01 (six cases) and HLA-A*03:01 (two cases) alleles
were associated with low risk. These assignments were in agreement with age of death:
only one patient homozygous by HLA-A*02:01 had not passed the 60 years age of death
threshold. Thus, homozygosity by HLA class I genes is generally associated with poor
prognosis except some alleles like HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 with “relevant”
peptide-binding profiles.

In the current study, we presented the characteristics of a large cohort of deceased
patients with COVID-19 from O.M. Filatov City Clinical Hospital in Moscow, Russia.
The clinical characteristics of these patients indicated that the HLA genotype, age and
underlying diseases were the most important risk factors for death. In our population

the median age of deceased patients was 73.0 years. Three previous studies reported an
average age in non-survivors respectively of 78.0, 65.8 and 70.7 years-old [24–26]. Our
data are in line with the literature reaffirming that advanced age is one of the strongest
predictors of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 [27].
The majority of deceased patients at age not greater than 60 were men (61.5%),
while the populational level for this age category in Russia is 48% [28]. Such imbalance
is in agreement with information that COVID-19 is more prevalent in men [27]. This
trend continued on group of elderly adults where sex distribution was close to uniform,
while only 37.5% of population from this age group are males.
Only 18 deceased elderly patients (21.2%) had not any comorbidities. A number of
previous studies mentioned high percentage of comorbidities in group of patients with
severe course of COVID-19 [24, 28, 29]. At the same time, we were unable to find
statistically significant differences in fractions on different comorbidities between adult
and elderly group except the percentage of cerebrovascular disease. Specifically, only
one adult (3.8%) had suffered from this disease compared to 29 individuals (34.1%)
from the older group. The results of previously conducted meta-analysis of 1558
individuals infected by COVID-19 already highlighted cerebrovascular disease as a risk
factor for COVID-19 infection, however this was not associated with increased
mortality [30]. It is well known that frequency of cardiovascular comorbidities increases
with age [31], and in total with age-related decrease in T-cell receptor repertoires it
negatively affects prognosis of COVID-19 [32].
Differences of frequencies of HLA class I alleles were not statistically significant after
multiple testing correction both in comparisons between deceased patients and control
group, and deaths of adults versus elderly ones. Previously, Wang with co-authors
performed comparisons of allele frequencies between groups of Chinese COVID-19
infected individuals with control ones which resulted in significant difference only for
rare alleles such as HLA-C*07:29 and HLA-B*15:27 [33]. Thus, the analysis of the
whole HLA class I genotype should be performed to identify possible associations with
clinical information.
Since the available cohort size is insufficient to deeply cover possible genotypes (two
alleles for each of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes) we assigned a numerical value to
each allele associated with aggregate binding affinity of viral peptides to the
corresponding receptor. The obtained risk score (RS) separated adult patients died due
to COVID-19 both from elderly ones and the control group with a statistical
significance. A conceptually similar technique was used by Iturrieta-Zuazo et al: allele
score was calculated as a number of tightly binding viral peptides (affinity less than
50 nM) [10]. However, our PC-based approach can be more robust since it does not
depend on any threshold.
To identify extreme values of RS we splitted its range into low, medium and high
risk groups. Three HLA-A alleles were highly overrepresented in these groups:
HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*03:01 were tightly associated with low risk while
HLA-A*01:01 contributed to the high risk group. Connection of HLA-A*01:01 and
HLA-A*02:01 alleles with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality was already mentioned in
the existing literature. Namely, frequency of HLA-A*01:01 in Italian regions positively
correlated both with number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, while significant negative
correlation was observed for HLA-A*02:01 [11].
An interesting illustration for the role of HLA-A*01:01 and
HLA-A*02:01/HLA-A*03.01 was discovered during the analysis of homozygous
individuals. Homozygosity only by HLA-A*01:01 as well as homozygosity by any allele
were significantly associated with earlier age of death compared to the corresponding
heterozygous individuals. Such observation was already noted for some other infectious
diseases. For example, limited number of recognized peptides due to HLA class I

homozygosity lead to higher progression rate from HIV to AIDS [34]. On the contrary,
we found that only one out of eight HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*03:01 homozygous
individuals died before 60 years. This fact can be also observed in dataset recently
published by Warren with co-authors [35]: none out of five COVID-19 patients
homozygous by HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*03:01 had severe course of COVID-19 and
were admitted to intensive care unit. Thus, presentation of “important” viral peptides
with doubled intensity can enhance immune response showing that HLA class I
homozygosity can act like a double-edged sword.
Since RS was constructed as a linear combination of peptide-HLA binding affinities,
it was possible to rank peptides according to their contribution to the RS. Only one
protein, NSP8, had a statistically significant fraction of RS contributing peptides, which,
however, was negligible after multiple testing correction. Thus, the most “important”
peptides were spread across viral proteins proportional to their total fractions (see
Table 3). These results suggest that spike protein-based vaccines at phase 3 clinical
trials (Gamaleya Research Institute, BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer, Moderna/NIAID,
University of Oxford/AstraZeneca, CanSino Biological Inc./Beijing Institute of
Biotechnology, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies and Novavax) can be no worse than
inactivated vaccines in terms of HLA class I presentation.
