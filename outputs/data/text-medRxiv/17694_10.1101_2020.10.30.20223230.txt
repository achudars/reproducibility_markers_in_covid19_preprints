CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs was performed on three occasions, and Euroimmun
ELISA for detection of IgA and IgG (S1 and NCP) antibodies was tested in paired serum
samples in May and July.

Results: All RT-PCR results were negative. Sixty-one (20%) participants were reactive in
one or

two classes

of antibodies at baseline and/or follow-up serology testing. IgA

reactivity was found in 41 (13.4% [95% CI=10.7-17.7]) baseline sera and 42 (13.8% [95%
CI=10.3-18.9]) follow-up sera. IgG to S1 protein was found in 6 (2% [95% CI=0.9-4.2])
participants at baseline and 1 (0.33% [95% CI=0.0006-1.83]) at follow-up. IgG to NCP
was found in 2 (0.7% [95% CI=0.2-2.4]) participants at baseline and 8 (2.6% (95% CI=1.35.1]) participants at follow-up. Noticeable dynamics in the paired sera was observed in
18 (5.9%) participants (excluding borderline IgA results) or 32 (10.5%) (including IgA
borderline results).

Conclusion: Various patterns of IgA and IgG reactivity were found in the paired serum
samples. Based on serology dynamics we estimate that in 5.9%-10.5% of PCR negative
football players asymptomatic exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during pandemics could not be
excluded.

Introduction:

The COVID-19 outbreak has affected all areas of life including professional sport (1). The
pandemic

has

stopped

the

sporting

calendar,

with

professional

leagues

around

the

globe suspending their activities to limit the virus's spread and confined the players to
an individual training regimen (2). SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly transmitted via droplets
and

aerosol

generated

by

sneezing,

coughing

and

talking,

as

well

as

through

contaminated hands since the virus can survive on various surfaces for several hours or

.

even days (3,4)

The diagnosis of COVID-19 includes clinical criteria, epidemiological

history and molecular detection of viral RNA in clinical samples. Serological assays that
detect specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be useful in various settings to identify the
individuals that remained asymptomatic but should not be used as a standalone test to
detect acute infection (5, 6).
The median time to onset of symptoms for persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is 5 days
(7). Studies suggest that the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases ranges from
17.9% to 78% (8, 9, 10). There is increasing evidence that asymptomatic or minimally
symptomatic

persons

can

spread

the

virus,

particularly

during

the

late

incubation

period, so it is of utmost importance to detect the asymptomatic spreaders timely to
prevent rapid disease transmission (11, 12). The immune response in asymptomatic
individuals

has

not

been

completely

understood

(13).

The

football

community

worldwide is keen to return to football activities, but the return to sporting activities
requires risk assessment based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence within a given cohort and
implementation of strict epidemiologic preventive measures accordingly (14). During
lock-down in Croatia, the football championship was interrupted as it was the case
worldwide. The Croatian Football Federation has launched a new model of pre-season
systematic examination of football players, coaches and staff members, with a particular
emphasis on diagnosing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to prevent further virus
spread

and

to

continue

safely

with

training

and

matches.

The

model

includes

epidemiological interviews combined with molecular and serological testing of players
before and during the re-starting phase of the first league championship to enable the
continuation of the first league games, although without spectators (15).
As repeated molecular testing of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs was negative
in all tested individuals in our cohort, in this paper we analyzed the serological findings
to explore the possibility of asymptomatic exposure to the virus. Earlier studies have
found that serum antibodies begin to rise one week after a coronavirus infection with
IgA and IgM peaking in the first 5-7 days and decline after 28 days, while IgG antibodies
can be detected 7-10 days after infection, reaching the peak 7 weeks later, with longterm memory plasma cells persisting for a

long time, protecting individuals against

reinfection (16, 17). Seroconversion is faster and more robust in patients with severe
disease (6). The duration of detectable antibodies and their neutralizing capacity is still
being studied (18, 19). For a more accurate interpretation of the serological result,
paired serum specimens from the same individual should be collected at least several
weeks apart (6). Various commercial assays utilizing different techniques that measure
the binding of IgG, IgM, and/or IgA antibodies have been developed. The performance

Methods

Study design

Prospective cohort study as a part of Croatian preseason football preparation in the era
of COVID-19 performed from April until July of 2020 (15).

Study Population

A

total

of

350

participants

including

all

registered

football

players

and

club

staff

members of the Croatian First Football National League participated in this study, all of
whom were male aged from 17 to 71 years. All participants were enrolled at the primary
club setting. The participants strictly followed the Croatian Football Federation protocol
that

included

limited

social

contact

and

training

in

small

groups.

None

of

the

participants presented with fever or any respiratory symptoms at the time of testing. An
epidemiological

questionnaire

was

filled

out

at

the

beginning

of

the

study.

One

participant was excluded from the study for not completing the questionnaire.
At the time of the third sampling 44 participants were lost to follow-up; therefore, the
final number of included participants in the study was 305.
Ethical approval for the study was gained from the Ethics Committee of the Institute of
Public Health “dr. Andrija Štampar”. All of the included patients gave a signed written
consent to be included in the study prior to testing.

Sampling

The testing was performed in three phases from May to July 2020. In phase 1 (last week
of May 2020), a nasopharyngeal swab was taken for RT-qPCR molecular analysis and the
epidemiological questionnaire was filled out by the participants (Supplementary Table
1). In phase 2 (five days after the initial sampling) another nasopharyngeal sample was
taken for molecular testing and a sample of peripheral venous blood was drawn for
serology. In phase 3 (last week of July), two months after phase 2, both molecular and
serological testing was repeated.
In all 3 phases sampling was performed in club ambulances by the same team doctors.
Molecular analysis in phases 1 and 2 was performed in the Department of Microbiology
of the Institute for Public Health “Dr. Andrija Štampar“, in phase 3 it was performed in

internal quality control was performed by parallel testing of 6 positive samples from
patients who were symptomatic and RT-qPCR confirmed COVID-19, 4-8 weeks before
serology testing. The OD ratios from positive controls were: IgA (S1): 0.81-2.58; IgG (S1):
1.65-7.43; IgG (NCP): 3.48-5.07.

paired serum samples, that in 5,9% of participants previous contact with SARS-CoV-2
was possible (Table 5). If the borderline results in one of the testing points are regarded
as positive, we cannot exclude the previous contact with SARS-CoV-2 in additional 14
(4.6%) participants, therefore a total of 10.5% of participants in our

cohort can be

suspected of having previous exposure to the virus (Table 5). However, the finding of
borderline IgA at both testing points was not assumed as probable contact due to the
low specificity of IgA antibodies reported (25, 26, 27).

Discussion

Study background
SARS-CoV-2 infection can have various clinical presentations: from asymptomatic to
severe cases with pneumonitis, ARDS, and multiple organ failure; and possible long-term
health consequences, primarily lung fibrosis
infections

show

a

mild

or

asymptomatic

(32, 33). In young people, most of the

course,

however,

severe

cases

with

heart

complications have also been described (34). Still, those patients can spread the virus to
their family, friends and colleagues, especially in the last days of incubation when the
quantity of virus is the highest in the respiratory specimens (6). This is important for
football players as they have many close contacts during training, traveling, matches,
etc. and can quickly spread the virus among their team, coaches, staff and others.
Football player’s career development requires a lot of time and effort invested into the
prevention of injury, disease, disability and even death, therefore it is crucial to identify
the infection early and isolate the infected person from the rest of the team in a timely
manner. In this prospective study, we wanted to explore what information on exposition
to SARS-CoV-2 we can obtain from serological data in the cohort of first league football
players and staff members that were preparing for the restart of football season during
the COVID-19 outbreak in Croatia. During the follow-up period from May to July 2020
study participants were tested three times for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Not a single case
of active infection was detected. All of the participants denied having any respiratory
symptoms or fever throughout the whole study period. The seroprevalence of SARSCoV-2 in the Croatian general population has not yet been published, but similar studies
in cohorts of healthcare professionals and factory workers demonstrated that 1.27% and
2.7% tested individuals were positive for the presence of antibodies respectively (35,
36).

Results comparison
Altogether in 61 out of 305 participants serum reactivity in at least one antibody class
was found. We detected IgA positivity in 7.9% and 6.9% at baseline and follow-up sera,
respectively.

be used for the screening of asymptomatic persons (27). Beavis et al. found 88.4% IgA

However, all of the aforementioned studies have investigated only single serum samples
from presumably negative individuals or COVID-19 patients, so no dynamics in antibody
response could be observed. On the contrary, we have analyzed paired sera and found
substantial positive IgA dynamics in 15 out of 305 (5%) of participants (Table 5, Figure
1). Borderline IgA results in asymptomatic patients are not easy to interpret, therefore

predictive value (28)

However, IgG (S1) was detectable at baseline only in 6 sera in our

cohort, out of which 4 were borderline and 2 had positive OD ratios (1.37 and 4.25). IgG
(S1) positivity was not observed in paired sera at follow up 2 months later. Ortho-Heller
and coworkers found a stronger decrease for IgG (NCP) than for S1 specific antibodies
looking at the longitudinal kinetics in the cohort of 20 non-hospitalized patients. They
conclude that a single SARS-COV-2 antibody test should not be used to exclude or
confirm a previous infection (37). In our cohort IgG (NCP) antibodies were detectable
only in two participants in phase 2, which also persisted through phase 3, while 6 new
positive participants appeared, indicating possible asymptomatic infection between the
two testing points. This is in line with Van Eslandie's retrospective study, which found a

Limitations and added value
This study's limitations include relatively small sample size, possible cross-reactivity with
antibodies to other human coronaviruses that were not analyzed, and the fact that only
one commercial ELISA test was used. Also, we were not able to include serum samples
from the pre-COVID era. The main added value of the study is the analysis of paired sera

tested for IgA and IgG S and NCP antibodies in a homogenous cohort of 305 healthy
young male participants, all negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in 3
testing phases and asymptomatic during the observation period.

Conclusion
Various patterns of IgA and IgG antibody reactivity were found in the cohort of 305
asymptomatic, RT-PCR negative Croatian first league football players in the paired
serum samples collected in the period from May to July 2020. IgA reactivity was
predominant and was found in 13.4% of tested sera at baseline and 13.8% at follow-up,
either as borderline or positive following the manufacturer's proposed OD ratios in the
ELISA test. According to already published data on false-positive IgA results in
presumably negative serum samples, our results should be interpreted cautiously. IgG
reactivity was scarce (0.3-2.6%) at both testing points. Based on serology dynamics, we
can conclude that in 5.9%-10.5% of PCR negative football players asymptomatic
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during pandemics could not be excluded. This calls for more
frequent testing in asymptomatic players, perhaps with rapid antigen tests as point-ofcare diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 (39, 40). It is obvious that SARS-CoV-2 can be
transmitted asymptomatically in the cohort of football players, and authorities should
insist on the strict implementation of preventive measures during overall sports
activities.
