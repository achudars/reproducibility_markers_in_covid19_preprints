Abstract
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Japan on January 15th, 2020, soon after the
pandemic originated in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, Japan experienced three distinct waves of the
outbreak in the span of a year and has been attributed to new exogenous strains and evolving existing
strains. Japan engaged very early on in tracking different COVID-19 strains and have sequenced
approximately 5% of all confirmed cases. While Japan has enforced stringent airport surveillance on
cross-border travelers and returnees, some carriers appear to have advanced through the quarantine
stations undetected. In this study 30493 genomes sampled in Japan were analyzed to understand the
strains, heterogeneity and temporal evolution of different SARS-CoV-2 strains. We identified 12 discrete
strains with a substantial number of cases with most strains possessing the spike (S) D614G and
nucleocapsid (N) 203_204delinsKR mutations. 155 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan and
39 of them were introduced after strict quarantine policy was implemented. In particular, the B.1.1.7
strain, that emerged in the United Kingdom (UK) in September 2020, has been circulating in Japan since
late 2020 after eluding cross-border quarantine stations. Similarly, the B.1.351 strain dubbed the South
African variant, P.1 Brazilian strain and R.1 strain with the spike E484K mutation have been detected in
Japan. At least 14 exogenous B.1.1.7 sub-strains have been independently introduced in Japan as of late
March 2021, and these strains carry mutations that give selective advantage including N501Y,
H69_V70del, and E484K that confer increased transmissibility, reduced efficacy to vaccines and possible
increased virulence. Furthermore, various strains, which harbor multiple variants in the PCR primers and
the probe developed by National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID), are emerging. It is imperative
that the quarantine policy be revised, cross-border surveillance reinforced, and new public health
measures implemented to mitigate further transmission of this deadly disease and to identify strains
that may engender resistance to vaccines.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019 before
rapid worldwide transmission in the first quarter of 2020. In just a year, the number of confirmed cases
exceeded 148 million globally with 3.1 million deaths as of April 27th, 20211 The actual number of
infections are likely much higher by accounting for asymptomatic cases and mild disease that do not get
tested and under reporting due to social stigma and discrimination associated with COVID-19 infections2.
The novel coronavirus quickly spread to neighboring Japan, with a confirmed case of an individual on Jan
15, 2020 with travel history to Wuhan3. Soon after the identification of the first case, a major initial
transmission catastrophe was averted when the government decreed the Diamond Princess cruise ship
with infected patients to be anchored off the coast of Japan and mandated a 14-day quarantine for all
passengers4. However, the number of confirmed infections has surpassed 572,000 with over 10
thousand reported fatalities in Japan1.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted an unprecedented stress on global health systems and has created
a ripple effect touching every rubric of human life. Particularly the impact on healthcare (including
mental health) and the underlying social, political, psychological and economic disruptions have had
profound ramifications. In Japan, the dichotomy between the public health safety and societal and
economic dynamics forced the postponement of the much-awaited summer Olympics and Paralympics
games in Tokyo. Nonetheless, Japan implemented a stringent surveillance process at airports and
seaports at the very early stages of the outbreak to monitor and quarantine travelers and repatriates
with COVID-19 infection. In short, the rigorous surveillance process required a negative COVID-19 test
prior to boarding, saliva antigen testing at the cross-border port-of-entry and, if positive, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) confirmation and sequencing at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. While
the surveillance process has been largely successful with 2392 patients detected and intercepted at
quarantine stations by end of March 20215, there appear to be some patients harboring exogenous
strains with different haplotypes of the virus who were undetected at the port-of-entry. Japan has been
vested and engaged from the beginning of the pandemic to monitor genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2
and has sequenced remarkable 30493 genomes which are approximately 5% of all confirmed cases.
Notwithstanding the rigor of the public health measures, three discrete waves of the disease have been
observed in Japan and it’s plausible that different viral strains may have contributed to each spike.
Mutations are inevitable as viruses evolve as a mechanism to cope with selective pressure and confer
selective advantage. COVID-19 is the first pandemic to occur after inexpensive sequencing technologies
became widely available. SARS-CoV-2 accumulates mutations at the rate of 1.0 x 10-3 (per
site/genome/year), that corresponds to 2.5 mutations in a month6. However, as number of the
infections increases, the number of variants increase proportionally. SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated and
established multiple mutations within a year from the first published report of D614G in early April
20207. New strains with spike N501Y mutation such as B.1.1.7 from England, B.1.351 from South Africa,
P.1 from Brazil and R.1 have recently emerged8. Previously, N501Y has been functionally characterized
and was reported to cause higher binding with ACE29 and another study reported that B.1.1.7 carrying
H69_V70del in addition to N501Y possess a higher infectivity rate of 75%10. Furthermore, B.1.351, P.1

and R.1 strains contain spike E484K and appear to confer reduced efficacy to the currently available
vaccines11,12.
In this work we have evaluated the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Japan to elucidate
different viral strains that were exogenously introduced, to understand community transmission
patterns and to delineate founder strains that further evolve within a community.

Methods
Between 1 February 2020 and 5 April 2021, genomes were downloaded from the publicly available viral
sequencing repositories, Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)13, National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and NGDC Genome Warehouse, and the National Microbiology Data
Center (NMDC); of the 939410 genomes downloaded, 30493 were from specimens collected in Japan.
Low quality genomes with gaps and ambiguous bases over 50 base pairs in length (excluding at the start
and the end of the genomes) were discarded. After completing quality control, variant analysis was
performed on 638543 including 29679 Japanese genomes with the method described previously6. In
brief, genomes were first aligned to the reference genome NC_045512 using The European Molecular
Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) needle14 with open gap penalty of 100 to filter out spurious
frameshifts. Next, differences with the reference genome were extracted and annotated using gene
definitions of SARS-CoV-2 as different variant types including missense, synonymous, non-coding and
indels. All the obtained variants including global cases are stored in Supplemental Table S1.
Subsequently, hierarchical clustering was performed on Japanese domestic cases to organize strains
with similar haplotypes to construct a variant graph (Figure 1B).
Haplotype defining major strains were extracted from the variant graph in Figure 1B. Numbers of
confirmed cases and deaths in Japan obtained from Our World in Data15 were shown in Figure 2A.
Monthly occurrences of each strain defined by the haplotype and its active period with evolutionary
relationships are illustrated in Figure 2B.
A candidate parent of a particular strain was identified by the maximum variant approach using the
haplotype of the query strain16. A parental strain should have a haplotype which is a subset of the query
strain. Among ancestors obtained in the previous step, the closest ancestor is the one with maximal
number of matches between haplotypes. The resulting parent and child relationships for all Japanese
domestic cases are obtained in Supplemental Table S2.
Data on monthly COVID-19 positive cases at airport quarantine centers in Japan and number of
passengers though immigration were obtained from a report released by the Japanese Government5,17
(Figure 4A). For each strain, we sought to identify a plausible parent including exogenous strains, which
share more common variants than any domestic strains. Number of exogenous strains for each month is
represented in Figure 4B. Among the exogenous strains, strains whose all probably ancestors were
found after April 15th were considered to have advanced through quarantine stations undetected (Table
2).
Strains which NIID_N qPCR probe fails to detect were identified by counting mutations in primers and
probe sites. If any given strain has mutations involving multiple bases in the probe or in the primers, the
strain was considered undetectable (Table 3).

Results
30493 genomes obtained between January 2020 and April 2021 were used for this analysis, accounting
for about 5% of the confirmed cases in Japan (Figure 1A). We identified that frequently observed
variants are shown in variant graph (Figure 1B). Spike protein D614G followed by ORF1ab P4715L (RdRp
P323L), 5’-UTR 241C>T, nucleocapsid protein (N) 203_204delinsKR and ORF1ab L16L (313C>T) are the
most common variants among strains in Japan, representing over 90% of all variants. L16L is unique to
Japanese D614G_KR and its derivative strains while other three variants are common to all global D614G
clade derived strains. Among the top non-synonymous variants, ORF1ab S1361P, P3371S, A4815V,
S1261P, P5968L, R7085I, N P151L, M234I and spike M153T, are highly specific to Japanese strains.
P3371S, which is located in 3CLPro, is reported to reduce the protease activity18.
By and large, strains circulating in Japan belong to one of the 12 strains as shown in Table 1; number of
samples belong to the strain, defining haplotype, and other common variants are displayed with
associated PANGO lineages19. The most frequently observed strain is D614G_KR_M234I, which harbors
P5968L, R7085I, and N: M234I and most likely evolved from D614G_KR in Japan in March 2020. Figure
2A depicts number of positive cases and deaths during the period along with important events. As
shown in Figure 2B, the Wuhan strain (wild type strain) and F6302L strain were introduced into Japan in
January 2020 followed by L84S, and L3606F strains in February. In March, D614G related strains D614G,
D614G_KR, D614G_Q57H were introduced into Japan. In April, a surge in D614G_KR occurred along with
the emergence of D614G_KR_P3771S. In May, D614G_KR_P3771S_M153T emerged from the parental
strain D614G_KR_P3771S and started gaining momentum during the summer. Although
D614G_KR_P3371S_M153T was first observed in May, transmission route does not originate from a
single founder(Figure 3). Therefore, the actual emergence appears to be at an earlier time. Significant
decrease in numbers were observed in June marking the end of the first wave. In July, Japan
experienced the second wave of the pandemic with three predominant strains detected:
D614G_KR_P3771S, its offspring D614G_KR_P3771S_M153T, and D614G_KR_M234I. Although infection
rates plateaued in October, Japan entered the third wave in November. While there is a paucity of
available genomes in November, D614G_KR_M234I appears to be the dominant strain in the third wave.
R1 and B117 strains were introduced in late 2020 and started gaining momentum in the fourth wave
replacing existing strains.
2392 positive cases were detected and intercepted at airport quarantine stations by the end of March
2021 since its inception in March 2020; of which 871 samples were sequenced(Figure 4A). In total, we
have identified that 155 distinct strains have been introduced into Japan. However, the number of
potentially undetected cases that evaded the surveillance scrutiny during the same time period was 39
after eliminating ambiguous cases as shown in Table 2. Most of the exogenous strains appears to have
been introduced into Japan before strict airport surveillance policy was implemented as shown in Figure
4B. Among the 39 cases, 14 independent B.1.1.7 strains advanced through the quarantine checkpoints
while 76 individuals carrying the strains were intercepted and quarantined. Besides spike N501Y variant,
it is quite concerning that spike E484K mutation has been reported to reduce vaccine efficacy12.
Furthermore, strains harboring spike E484K, namely, B.1.351, the South African strain, P.1, the Brazilian
strain, and recently identified R.1 strain have been introduced into Japan. The R.1 strains were first
observed in Niigata Prefecture in November (GISAID: EPI_ISL_895012); however, this strain has an extra

mutation ORF1ab T265I compared with EPI_ISL_1123466, which is identified in late December as seen in
Table 2. We were not able to identify the progenitor R.1 strain in any of the high-quality genomes in the
cohort. However, we discovered a probable ancestor in a genome from United Kingdom (UK) (GISAID:
EPI_ISL_675164) collected in November 14 which had long undetermined bases beyond the quality
threshold of this study. To be exact, EPI_ISL_675164 has 4456C>T (ORF1ab A1397A) synonymous
mutation, which Japanese R.1 strains are missing. UK has high volume of SARS CoV-2 sequencing, and
no other R.1 strain was uncovered in November in UK. Furthermore, a sample from a Japanese
quarantine station obtained from a traveler from Liberia in December (GISAID: EPI_ISL_736897) belongs
to R.1. Combining these facts, it is likely that the R.1 strain may have originated elsewhere other than UK,
where genomic surveillance is not frequently conducted.
Since qPCR tests have been performed to detect SARS-CoV-2, it is concerning that emerging strains are
not detectable with qPCR tests. In Japan, NIID_N qPCR test kit was developed to detect SARS-CoV-220.
Although it is well designed and captures most of the strains reported today, there exists strains which
harbor multiple mutations in primer and probe sites as shown in Table 3.

Discussion
In this work we have identified multiple independently introduced discrete strains of SARS-CoV-2 in
Japan which may have contributed to community spread. We also observed further evolution of
exogenous founder strains after their introduction into Japan. It is quite intriguing that D614G_KR is
dominant despite the fact that comparable numbers of D614G and D614G_Q57H strains were
introduced into Japan. For unknown reasons, strains other than D614G_KR have not been able to
establish and propagate in Japan21.
The airport quarantine stations have intercepted 2392 individuals carrying SARS-CoV-2 strains. For
landlocked countries with contiguous borders, such quarantine strategy is not easy to implement. While
cross-border surveillance is easier to implement in an island such as Japan, the study identified 39 cases,
which had advanced through airport quarantine checkpoints and introduced to the Japanese population
(Table 2). Since only 5% of confirmed cases have been sequenced, the actual number of individuals and
SARS-CoV-2 strains passing undetected at quarantine stations is likely to be larger. Airport quarantine
checkpoints have been utilizing antigen testing on saliva samples to improve lead times and throughput
since July 27th 2020. The number of positive cases detected at borders decreased in August in spite of
the slight increase in number of people who entered Japan as seen in Figure 4A. It is more difficult to
detect pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with an antigen test on a saliva sample. It is
concerning that the antigen test has low positive agreement rate of 55.2% with respect to qPCR
resulting in high false negative rates for nasopharyngeal samples 22. In fact, four distinct B.1.1.7 strains
have been identified and the number of people infected with B.1.1.7 has alarmingly augmented.
Mandatory qPCR should be introduced to identify and intercept emerging strains such as B.1.1.7,
B.1.351, P.1. and R.1. and any novel future strains. Additionally, global genomic data should be vigilantly
monitored to identify new variants that potentially may be hard to discover with a traditional antigen or
an existing qPCR test. As the virus accumulates more mutations, it is not possible to capture all the
strains with a single probe test; therefore, it is advisable to utilize multiple probe qPCR.
Besides test accuracy at quarantine stations, compliance among travelers is another possibility of cases
being undetected. Public health offices are urging cross-border travelers to be monitored for 14 days
but there is no guarantee that they have followed the proper self-quarantine protocols. In fact,
approximately 20% of cross border travelers have been lost for follow-up 23. Furthermore, some
travelers enter Japan from exempt countries viewed as low risk; similarly, airline employees had been
exempted from testing. During 14-day self-quarantine period, one can transmit to his/her family
members or cohabitants, who can further transmit to people outside the household. Thus, it would be
ideal to conduct interim and exit testing to further reduce infected passengers from circulating
exogenous strains24.
There are several limitations of this study. While the genomes from airport quarantine checkpoints were
released in a timely manner; the genomes from Japanese domestic samples lagged behind by months.
Furthermore, more precise information on collection dates is needed; most of the Japanese samples
only carry year and month but not the date. Moreover, specimen collection locations are not available
on most instances. Therefore, it is challenging to evaluate spatial propagation of the virus and to assess
the effect of a ‘go-to’ travel campaign to encourage business and leisure travel in an attempt to rescue
the ailing travel industry. Therefore, while the study could not reveal unambiguous evidence, the

campaign may have contributed to the resurgence of the virus across Japan and exacerbated the
situation25.
It is imperative that the government mitigate the spread of new strains carrying the spike N501Y and
E484K by reinforcing quarantine policies, further ramping up genome sequencing and large scale antigen
testing for asymptomatic population26. In particular, wide spread of E484K variant strains may
undermine vaccination efforts and discourage Japanese citizens from getting the vaccines. More
aggressive genome sampling would facilitate understanding transmission dynamics of the virus including
origins, routes, and rates, which is critical to its containment. Additional genomic analysis with clinical
data as well as employing animal models will provide insights on infectivity, susceptibility, treatment
resistance, vaccine evasion as well as the inferred pathogenicity and virulence27,28.
The COVID-19 pandemic is not over yet. Most citizens are not expected to be immunized by summer
2021, a time when Japan is hoping to host the postponed Olympic and Paralympics games. The onus is
on the government of Japan to successfully executing these events while ensuring the public health
safety of its citizens. The COVID-19 pandemic won’t be the last pandemic to affect mankind; therefore,
reflections on the lessons learned through this ordeal should be used to ameliorate the effects of the
next pandemic.
