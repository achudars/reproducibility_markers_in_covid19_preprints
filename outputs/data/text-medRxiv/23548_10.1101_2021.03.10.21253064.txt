Abstract

Background

A few studies on antibody testing have focused on asymptomatic or mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

patients with low initial anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody

responses. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from

asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.

Methods

Blood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after

diagnosis. Simultaneously, a second SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the

COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and

electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against

the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare

false-negative- with positive-result samples.

Results

Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were

0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972,

and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848,

respectively. IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates in the patients with negative results from the second

genetic testing were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively. All antibody titers, especially those of the IgG

antibody against nucleocapsid protein, were significantly lower in blood samples with false-negative results than

in those with positive results.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing has lower performance in asymptomatic or mild

COVID-19 patients than required in the guidelines, and situations in which it is useful are limited.

Introduction

The clinical indications for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody

testing are limited, although many methods have been developed. The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG or

total antibodies at 3–4 weeks after symptom onset may be useful in determining past infection in selected

clinical situations; however, data in this context are limited. [3] On the other hand, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

testing may play an essential role in the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and in

understanding the outbreak dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.[4,5] However, a previous study reported that

initial anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were lower in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients than in

severe COVID-19 patients.[1] Since the percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in large-sample

studies was 43.0%–76.5%[2], it is necessary to elucidate the performance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing

in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients.

We preserved blood samples of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients collected from a large cruise ship that

had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak. The cruise ship anchored at Nagasaki Port from the end of January

2020, and one of the 623 crew members complained of pneumonia symptoms and was diagnosed with

COVID-19 in mid-April 2020. Thereafter, SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing was performed on all cruise ship crew

members, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 144 individuals. However, most patients received care on the ship

because they were asymptomatic or did not need inpatient treatment, such as oxygen administration.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing using the lateral flow

immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) in blood samples

from crew members and those collected from patients between November 2014 and August 2019. In addition,

we measured the titers of several anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and compared them between false-negative- and

positive-result samples in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

(ELISA).

Methods

Study design

In this study, asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 was defined as a cruise ship crew member who was not

hospitalized when blood samples were collected. Blood samples were collected from 178 crew members in

mid-May 2020, 3 weeks after the first SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing. Thirty-four blood samples were excluded

from the final analysis due to negative results in the first SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing, and one blood sample

was excluded because the patient was hospitalized at the time of sample collection (Fig. 1). Finally, 143 blood

samples collected from crew members who had positive first SARS-CoV-2 genetic test results 3 weeks before

blood samples were analyzed in this study. A total of 269 stored blood samples were collected from patients at

Nagasaki University Hospital between November 2014 and August 2019. After deduplication, 174 blood

samples from patients were used as negative controls in this study (Fig. 1). The blood samples were stored at −

80 °C until further antibody testing. Initially, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using LFA and ECLIA

by clinical technologists at Nagasaki University Hospital. Subsequently, to confirm which antibodies were

influenced by LFA- and ECLIA-negative results in crew-member samples, IgM and IgG antibody titers against

anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein (SP) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) were measured using ELISA at Nagasaki

University Hospital by Cellspect Co., Ltd, researchers. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected without

notification of each result. Results from the second SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing using real-time reverse

transcription polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR[6] testing were obtained from the database. The second genetic

testing was performed on nasopharyngeal samples collected from cruise ship crew members at approximately

the same time as blood samples were collected.

Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected using the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgM/IgG LFA testing kit

(RF-NC001 and RF-NC002, Kurabo Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The results from tests using these kits were assessed by two clinical technologists. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total

antibodies were detected by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan) using a Cobas

e801 analytical unit for immunoassay tests (Roche Diagnostics K.K., Tokyo, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The judgment criteria for ECLIA were as follows: positive, cutoff index (COI) ≥
1.0; negative, COI < 1.0. To measure anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against SP (QuaResearch

COVID-19 human IgM/IgG ELISA kit, RCOEL961N, Cellspect Co., Ltd., Iwate, Japan) and those against NP

(QuaResearch COVID-19 human IgM/IgG ELISA kit, RCOEL961, Cellspect Co., Ltd., Iwate, Japan), ELISA

was performed by Cellspect Co., Ltd. The antigen proteins immobilized in the ELISA kit were recombinant SP

(16-1213 AA) of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in mammalian cells and recombinant NP (1-419 AA) of SARS-CoV-2

expressed in Escherichia coli. To measure IgM and IgG antibodies against SP, serum or plasma samples were

diluted 1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline with Tween detergent (PBST); to

measure IgM and IgG antibodies against NP, serum or plasma samples were diluted 1:1000 in 2% non-fat

milk/PBST. The absorbance was read at 450 nm using an automatic ELISA system (QRC5LB925, Cellspect Co.,

Ltd., Iwate, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cutoff value determined in a previous study

was used to interpret the ELISA results. [7] The cutoff values for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody titers

against SP were set at 0.25 and 0.26 and those against NP at 0.4 and 0.7, respectively. [7]

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using EZR version 1.53 (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical

University, Saitama, Japan), which is a graphical user interface for R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation for Statistical

Computing, Vienna, Austria). Fisher’s exact test or the chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables

and the Mann–Whitney U test to compare continuous variables. The statistical significance level was set at P

<0.05. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value

(NPV) of the antibody testing were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Spearman's rank-order

correlation was used to evaluate the correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in ELISA and COIs

in ECLIA.

Results

Performance of LFA and ECLIA in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were detected using LFA in 33 (23.1%) and 69 (48.3%) blood

samples collected from crew members, respectively (Figs. 2A and 2B). The blood-sample positivity rate for

LFA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was significantly higher than that for IgM (p < 0.001).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in all blood samples, with positive results for LFA-detected

IgM antibodies. There was no positive result for LFA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the negative

controls, whereas there were two positive results for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the negative controls.

The Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of LFA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and

0.613, respectively (Fig. 2A). The Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of LFA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies

were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively (Fig. 2B).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies were detected using ECLIA in 112 (78.3%) blood samples collected from the

crew (Fig. 2C). There was no positive result for ECLIA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies in the

negative controls. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies were detected using ECLIA in all blood samples, with

positive IgG antibody results detected by LFA. The blood-sample positivity rate for ECLIA-detected

anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies was significantly higher than that for LFA-detected IgM and IgG antibodies

(p < 0.001). The Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of ECLIA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000,

1.000, and 0.848, respectively (Fig. 2C).

Among 143 COVID-19 patients, 105 (73.4%) tested negative in the second SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing using

nasopharyngeal samples collected at approximately the same time as blood samples were collected. The positive

rates of LFA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies and ECLIA-detected total antibodies in the

crew with positive results from the second SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing were 23.7% (9/38), 50.0% (19/38), and

94.7% (36/38), respectively. The positivity rates in crew members with negative results from the second

SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing were 22.9% (24/105), 47.6% (50/105), and 72.4% (76/105), respectively. The

positivity rate for ECLIA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies was significantly higher in crew members

with positive results from the second SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing than that in crew members with negative

results (p = 0.003).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers measured using ELISA in COVID-19 patients

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP IgM and IgG and anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP IgM and IgG antibody titers in blood samples

collected from crew members were measured using ELISA. The median anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG

antibody titers against SP were 0.10 (0.07–0.47) and 0.27 (0.07–0.71), and those against NP were 0.18

(0.10–1.08) and 0.56 (0.18–2.82), respectively. The positivity rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies

against SP in COVID-19 patients was 1.4% (2/143) and 31.5% (45/143), and those against NP were 3.5%

(5/143) and 44.8% (64/143), respectively.

Comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers between samples with false-negative and those with positive

LFA results

Antibody titers were compared between blood samples with false-negative results and those with positive LFA

results (Fig. 3). Antibody titers for all antibodies were significantly higher in blood samples with positive results

than in those with false-negative results (Fig. 3A-D). COI in ECLIA was also significantly higher in blood

samples with positive results than in those with false-negative results (Fig. 3E). The positivity rates for

ELISA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against SP in samples with false-negative results

were 0% (0/74) and 16.2% (12/74), and those against NP were 1.4% (1/74) and 9.5% (7/74), respectively. The

positivity rates for ELISA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against SP in samples with

positive results were 2.9% (2/69) and 47.8% (33/69), and those against NP were 5.8% (4/69) and 82.6% (57/69),

respectively. The positivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against SP and NP were significantly

lower in samples with false-negative results than in those with positive results (both p<0.001).

Comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers between samples with false-negative and those with positive

ECLIA results

Antibody titers were compared between blood samples with false-negative results and those with positive

ECLIA results (Fig. 4). Antibody titers for all antibodies were significantly higher in blood samples with

positive results than in those with false-negative results (Figs. 4A–D). The positivity rates for ELISA-detected

anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against SP in samples with false-negative results were 0% (0/31) and

9.7% (3/31), and those against NP were 3.2% (1/31) and 0% (0/31), respectively. The positivity rates for

ELISA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against SP in samples with positive results were

1.8% (2/112) and 37.5% (42/112), and those against NP were 3.6% (4/112) and 57.1% (64/112), respectively.

The positivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against SP and NP were significantly lower in samples

with false-negative results than in those with positive results (p=0.004 and p<0.001, respectively).

The correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in ELISA and COI in ECLIA among blood samples

collected from crew members was also evaluated (Fig. 5). The correlation coefficients between COI in ECLIA

and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against SP were 0.324 and 0.398, and those against NP were

0.332 and 0.812, respectively.

Discussion

This study revealed the performance of LFA and ECLIA in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in

asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients. The sensitivities of LFA for both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG

antibodies were low (0.231 and 0.483, respectively) in this study. LFA’s sensitivity in this study was lower than

that reported in two previous studies. One previous study reported IgM- and IgG-antibody positivity in all 24

COVID-19 patients.[8] In another study using blood samples collected from 12 COVID-19 patients, including

two asymptomatic (16.7%) and seven mild patients (58.3%), the kit’s sensitivity for IgM and IgG antibodies

was 0.750 and 0.727, respectively. [9] ECLIA’s sensitivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies was 0.783 in

this study, which was higher than that of LFA. However, ECLIA’s sensitivity in this study was lower than that

reported in previous studies using the same ECLIA kit; the sensitivity in previous studies was 0.920–0.995

[10–12]. One study reported that ECLIA’s sensitivity in all patients was 0.920–0.927; however, ECLIA’s

sensitivity in 6 (4.0%) asymptomatic patients and 37 (24.8%) mild patients was reported to be approximately

0.800.[10] The results of this study demonstrated that ECLIA’s sensitivity in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2

antibodies was relatively low in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients. Considering the results of this study,

the sensitivities of LFA and ECLIA in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients were lower than the required

clinical sensitivity in the guidelines. [3]

In contrast to sensitivity, the specificities of LFA and ECLIA were very high in this study. These results were

consistent with those of previous studies using the same kits [10–14]. Although there were no samples with

false-positive results for LFA-detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies and ECLIA-detected total antibodies,

there were two samples with false-positive results for LFA-detected SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A previous

study using the same LFA kit reported SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in 57% (4/7) of patients with

human common cold coronavirus pneumonia.[8] The results from the previous study indicated that the LFA kit

used in this study had cross-reactivity with antibodies against human common cold coronavirus. Although the

false-positivity rate was very low in this study, the LFA kit may not be suitable for screening COVID-19

patients or for COVID-19 serological surveillance in a population with a low prevalence of COVID-19 because

specificity is especially important in such situations.[3,15] In this study, 73.4% of COVID-19 patients tested

negative in the second SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing using nasopharyngeal samples collected at approximately

the same time as blood samples were collected. However, LFA and ECLIA detected anti-SARS-CoV-2

antibodies in 47.6% and 72.4% of patients with negative results in the second SARS-CoV-2 genetic testing,

respectively. These data support the recommendation in the guidelines, [3] although it is necessary to consider

the possibility of false-negatives in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody titers against SP and NP were measured using ELISA in this study.

All antibody titers were significantly lower in samples with false-negative results than in those with positive

results in both LFA and ECLIA. Among the antibodies, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against SP and NP

were noticeably divided between blood samples with positive and those with false-negative results in both

methods. Additionally, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer against NP in ELISA was strongly correlated

with COI in ECLIA. The ECLIA kit used in this study detects total antibodies (IgG, IgA, and IgM) against NP

[16,17]; however, our data indicated that a low titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody against NP contributed to the

false-negative results in asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients. A previous study reported that a

combination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against NP and SP increased the percentage of positive results.[18]

In fact, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer against SP in ELISA had a weaker correlation with COI in ECLIA

in this study. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG positivity rates were also very low in COVID-19

patients with false-negative ECLIA results. Since all anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing that was granted

emergency use authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration targeted SP and/or NP, it is

currently difficult to improve the sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild

COVID-19 patients.

This study has several limitations. First, although all COVID-19 patients analyzed in this study were either

asymptomatic or mild, we did not know their distribution. Because the positivity rates of ELISA-detected

anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against SP and NP were lower than those in mild COVID-19 patients in a

previous study[7], it is expected that the percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was higher than that of

mild COVID-19 patients. Second, only one kit each of LFA, ECLIA, and ELISA was used in this study. Thus,

other kits could have possibly had higher sensitivity in asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients than those

used in this study. However, since the ECLIA used in this study demonstrated good sensitivity compared to

other ECLIA kits,[10–12] it may be difficult to improve sensitivity by using others. Third, the time-course of the

anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody testing was not evaluated in this study. This study focused on the time point that was

reported as one of the best times for anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody testing [7,9,10]; however, it is possible that the

optimal time for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients varies. Finally,

the neutralizing antibodies were not evaluated. A previous study reported that the results of the ECLIA kit used

in this study were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization; nevertheless, it also reported that the kit had poor

negative-percent agreement for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Therefore, further investigation is required to

confirm whether COVID-19 patients with false-negative results have neutralizing antibodies.

In conclusion, the findings of this study corroborate the recommendations of the guidelines. [3] They suggest

that the sensitivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients is lower

than the required clinical sensitivity. In addition, it may be difficult to improve anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

testing sensitivity at present because anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody titers against SP and NP were

very low in COVID-19 patients with false-negative results. On the other hand, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

testing may be useful in limited contexts, such as in patients at 3–4 weeks after symptom onset but with

negative SARS-CoV-2 genetic test results.
