Abstract: Background: The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant

21

changes to homes, working life and stress. The purpose of this research was to investigate the

22

implications that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the menstrual cycle and any contributing

23

factors to these changes. Methods: A questionnaire was completed by 749 participants, whom

24

ranged from ‘physically active’ to elite, in their training status. The questionnaire captured

25

detail on menstrual cycle symptoms and characteristics prior to and during the COVID-19

26

pandemic lockdown period, as well as lifestyle, stress, exercise and nutrition. Descriptive

27

statistics and frequency distribution were reported and decision tree analysis performed.

28

Statistical significance was assumed at p<0.05. Results: Fifty-two point six percent of females

29

experienced a change in their menstrual cycle during the lockdown period. Psychosocial

30

symptoms had changed in over half of all participants. Participants who reported increased

31

stress/worry in family and personal health were significantly associated with changes in

32

menstrual symptoms. Similarly, job security stress was associated with increases in bleeding

33

time (p<0.05). Conclusions: It is important that females and practitioners become aware of the

34

implications of stressful environments and the possible long-term implications on fertility,

35

particularly given the uncertainty around a second wave of the global pandemic.

1. Introduction

46

The menstrual cycle is a natural process for most females that occurs in the

47

reproductive years between puberty and menopause. A ‘normal’ (eumenorrheic) menstrual

48

cycle lasts 22-35 days (Fehring, Schneider and Raviele, 2006) and is characterised by a

49

cyclical fluctuation of sex hormones mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which is

50

essential for maintenance of bone health and fertility. Whilst oestrogen and progesterone are

51

the key sex hormones involved in the reproductive system, they are also vital in the

52

regulation of other physiological systems and maintaining holistic health. In particular,

53

oestrogen is a key regulator of bone resorption (Chen, Wang and Huang, 2009) and also has a

54

cardioprotective role (Iorga et al., 2017). Therefore, continuous oestrogen exposure through

55

the menstrual cycle post-puberty and pre-menopause could also reduce risk of other health

56

conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease (Bae, Park and Kwon, 2018;

57

Mumford et al., 2012).

58

A eumenorrheic menstrual cycle can be used to indicate that the body is in an

59

adaptive physiological state, and not subject to excess stress. Therefore, from a physical

60

performance perspective, it can be used to guide readiness and adaptation. Dysregulation of

61

this process may be multifactorial; often occurring as a result of perturbation of the

62

hypothalamic-pituitary axis (Roca et al., 2003), which causes a reduction in the secretion and

63

production of ovarian steroids (Nappi et al., 1993). Irregularities often present with

64

anovulation, and may involve changes in cycle length or the cessation of cycles

65

(hypothalamic amenorrhea) (Bae, Park and Kwon, 2018; Kato et al., 1999). Whilst prolonged

66

energy deficiencies are often cited as being the aetiology of functional hypothalamic

67

amenorrhea (De Souza et al., 2020), other causes have been reported, such as sleep

68

disturbances, lifestyle stress and alterations in circadian timing systems (Lateef and

69

Akintubosun, 2020). Up to 90% of women of a reproductive age also experience menstrual

70

cycle symptoms (Halbreich, 2003), and severe symptoms have consistently been shown to

71

affect quality of life (Choi et al., 2010; Kahyaoglu Sut and Mestogullari, 2016) as well as

72

negatively impacting exercise performance (Findlay et al., 2020; Chantler, Mitchell and

73

Fuller, 2009). Premenstrual symptoms are positively associated with poor diet and lack of

74

exercise (Rad, Sabzevary and Dehnavi, 2018; Cheng et al., 2013), as well as increased

75

alcohol intake (Fernández et al., 2018).

76

Psychological stress has frequently been associated with alterations to menstrual cycle

77

duration and the number and severity of symptoms (Nagma et al., 2015; Palm-Fischbacher

78

and Ehlert, 2014); illustrated by the increase in the prevalence of amenorrhea during wartime

79

(DREW, 1961; Barsom et al., 2004). Recent research has reported that students under a high

80

amount of perceived stress were four times more likely to be amenorrhoeic (Rafique and Al-

81

Sheikh, 2018). Furthermore, women with stressful jobs were twice as likely to experience a

82

decreased cycle length (Fenster et al., 1999), often as a consequence of decreased follicular

83

phase length, with little variation in the length of the luteal phase (McIntosh et al., 1980).

84

However, stressful environments have not consistently been shown to cause changes in the

85

length or regularity of the menstrual cycle characteristics (Williams et al., 2020; Clarvit,

86

1988; Nagata et al., 1986). Contradictions between findings may be due to individual

87

variation in dispositional resilience, which may be a protective psychological trait regarding

88

menstrual function in high stress scenarios (Palm-Fischbacher and Ehlert, 2014).

89

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and, for some, a fatal

90

disease. The spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a global pandemic and public health

91

emergency. The pandemic has had a widespread, negative impact on many aspects of society,

92

and there is growing concern that necessary measures such as self-isolation and limits on

93

exercise and travel may negatively impact psychological health (Mehrsafar et al., 2020;

94

World Health Organisation, 2020). The severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle-east

95

respiratory syndrome epidemics have both previously demonstrated increases in psychiatric

96

comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks and suicidality (Cheung, Chau and

97

Yip, 2008; Mak et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2020b). Recent surveys in China following the

98

onset of COVID-19 have reported that 25% of college students experienced symptoms of

99

anxiety, whilst 53% of Chinese residents deemed the psychological impact of COVID-19 to

100

be moderate or severe (Wang et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020). Recent research has identified

101

reduced sleep quality during the COVID-19 outbreak as the primary mediator of negative

102

emotions (e.g. stress and anxiety) during this time (Zhang et al., 2020b). However, the

103

authors did find that regular exercise could offset this (Zhang et al., 2020b). There is little

104

evidence concerning the effect of living through a pandemic or epidemic on menstrual

105

function. This is partly due to the limited representation of female participants in research

106

following these crises (Wenham et al., 2020). However, following the 2014-2016 West

107

African Ebola virus epidemic, one study conducted in Liberia found that 27% women who

108

had been eumenorrheic before the outbreak, experienced irregular menstruation afterwards

109

(Godwin et al., 2019). However, as the Ebola virus also resulted in rapid weight loss, the

110

authors note that it is unclear the specific reasons for which the irregularities occurred.

111

COVID-19 has resulted in significant upheaval of daily life for individuals

112

worldwide, with changes to work, social, diet, exercise patterns (Ammar et al., 2020; Ashby,

113

2020; Zhang et al., 2020a) which has resulted in increased stress (Ozamiz-Etxebarria et al.,

114

2020; Torales et al., 2020; Vindegaard and Benros, 2020). For exercising females there is a

115

greater risk of menstrual dysfunction (Baker, 1981; Slater et al., 2016), this combined with

116

the heightened stress of COVID-19, could result in nationwide spread of exacerbated

117

menstrual cycles symptoms and/or increased susceptibility to changes in cycle length. Given

118

the importance of the menstrual cycle for females, the aim of this study was to investigate the

119

different symptoms and alterations to the menstrual cycle that females may have experienced

121

disturbances.

2. Materials and Methods

124

2.1. Ethics and Participant recruitment

125

The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and approved

126

by the institutional ethics committee at Nottingham Trent University. Participant recruitment

127

and data collection took place from 27th May 2020 – 17th June 2020. Participants were

128

eligible to if they were; aged ≥18 years; exercising at any level; eumenorrheic (pre COVID-

129

19) with or without a form of hormonal contraception. Participants must have experienced a

130

minimum of nine menstrual cycles or withdrawal bleeds over the past 12 months (prior to

131

COVID-19).

132

2.2. Survey Development

133

The questionnaire contained 33 questions and was developed by all researchers,

134

whom collectively have extensive experience with questionnaire design. The survey platform

135

Qualtrics (Qualtrics 2005; 37, 892 ed. Provo, Utah, USA) was used to make the questionnaire

136

accessible online. The questionnaire was compiled of mainly binary or multiple-choice

137

questions. The online link provided to the questionnaire began with the participant

138

information sheet, followed by participant consent. By proceeding to the next stage

139

participants were able to consent to the study. If participants did not wish to proceed, they

140

were able to close the browser prior to consent. All participants provided themselves with a

141

unique participant identification to ensure anonymity.

142

The survey comprised of five sections. The first section provided an introduction and

143

contained demographic related questions such as age, occupation, primary sport, level of

144

competition, menstrual status, cycle length prior to COVID-19, marital status and ethnicity.

145

The second section captured detail about the participants’ working status prior to COVID-19

146

and during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, information around children and if

147

applicable, how this affected their working routine. This section also included Likert scales to

148

detail how financial status and job security affected worry and stress. The third section

149

requested detail on exercise behaviour changes that may or may not have occurred for the

150

participant during lockdown. There were ten different categories of training in which the

151

participants could answer with one of the following options: 1; about the same, 2; increased,

152

3; decreased, 4; I never do this. The fourth section contained questions concerning the

153

menstrual experiences of the participants, based on previous work by co-author’s xxx. The

154

same options used in section three applied here for 28 different symptoms associated with the

155

menstrual cycle. Participants were also asked about the length of their cycle and bleeding

156

patterns in a multiple-choice format (increased, decreased, stayed the same), with an

157

opportunity to elaborate on coping mechanisms for any symptoms that may have arisen

158

during the COVID-19 lockdown. The final section of the questionnaire focused on the

159

general health of the participant. This included Likert scales regarding worry around personal

160

and family health, and whether the participants have been previously diagnosed with, or have

161

been assumed to have/had, COVID-19. The final element of the survey captured aspects of

162

nutritional intake that may have changed during the lockdown using the previously

163

mentioned scale (1-4) from sections 3 and 4. Data processing is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3. Data Analysis

169

Data were analysed using IBM SPSS (v. 23.0) and Microsoft Excel. Partial responses

170

were removed from the dataset. Data was then coded to categorised responses and then

171

frequency analysis was carried out. Data are represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD),

172

frequencies and percentages. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Further analysis was

173

carried out using R Statistical Software. Decision trees were created using the rpart

174

(Therneau and Atkinson, 2019) and rpart.plot (Milborrow, 2019) packages to explore

175

possible connections between changes in menstrual symptoms since the onset of COVID-19

176

and specific lifestyle changes covered in the questionnaire. These trees were pruned using 10-

177

fold cross-validation to prevent over-fitting. Potential relationships between changes in

178

symptoms and lifestyle identified by the decision trees were then tested using Fisher’s exact

179

test.

3. Results

183

3.1 Participant Characteristics

184

Participant characteristics and demographics are displayed in Table 1. 97.2% of the

185

sample did not have a diagnosis of COVID-19 at the time of reporting, with 13.3% declaring

186

they had experienced some symptoms of COVID-19 and had therefore had to self-isolate.

187

Ten percent reported that someone in their household had experienced symptoms and in turn

188

they were required to self-isolate.

3.2 Participant Stress and Employment

220

Prior to COVID-19 >75% of our sample were in full-time employment. During

221

COVID-19 lockdown half of the respondents reported to be working full-time at home and

222

17% were working part-time at home. Only 54 participants indicated they had been

223

furloughed at either 80% or 100% pay. Distribution of working status prior to and during

224

COVID-19 is shown in Fig. 2.

225

The stress experienced by participants is displayed in table 2. The majority of those

226

with children expressed that their children caused higher levels of daily stress. When

227

considering other possible sources of stress and worry such as financial stress, job security

228

and stress regarding menstrual symptoms, most participants (>50%) did not report being

229

overly worried or stressed (1-3 on Likert scale) by such parameters (Table 2).

3.3 Menstrual Cycle Symptoms

249

Most changes to menstrual symptoms experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic

250

were psychosocial in nature (Fig. 3). Over half of all participants reported to have

251

experienced lack of motivation (59.3%), focus (53.1%) and concentration (54.9%). Similarly,

252

symptoms of mood changes, irritability, emotional feeling, worry and being distracted were

253

all reported in over half of all participants. There were minimal differences in this pattern

254

when dividing participants between those who were hormonal contraceptive users or not.

261

Decision tree analysis indicated differences in the symptoms suffered by women

262

training at sub-elite level and those who considered themselves physically active. Of those

263

women who experienced increased bloating, 54% were sub-elite level competitors or above,

264

compared to only 46% of those participating below this level (p=0.035). However, the tree

265

(Supplementary file, Figure 4) also revealed that higher level competitors may have been less

3.4 Nutrition and Exercise Patterns

269

Changes in nutritional and exercise patterns can be found in Table 4. When assessing

270

both nutritional changes and exercise behaviours according to any changes in menstrual cycle

271

length, a consistent pattern remains whether the females expressed a change in menstrual

272

cycle length or not.

3.5 Decision Tree Analysis

277

Of the 28 symptoms listed in Fig. 3, women indicated a 9.4 point average increase

278

during the pandemic (of the 28 symptoms given, the number represented here indicates the

279

average number of symptoms that were reported to increase). However, decision tree analysis

280

(Supplementary file, Figure 4) revealed that factors associated with ‘stress’ had the most

281

significant impact on this increase in symptoms. Women who rated personal health stress

282

pre-COVID-19 at three or higher (see Table 2) increased to 11 during the lockdown period

283

and this score increased to 13 if additional stress concerning family health was given the

16

284

highest rating. Among the women with lower levels of stress about personal health, the

285

average increase in symptoms was 7.8 but this score only stayed low among women who

286

maintained or increased their fruit and vegetable intake (7.3). Among those who did not, an

287

average of 11 symptoms increased.

288

The cross-validated decision tree process did not identify any factors significantly

289

related to blood-loss changes but did show that high levels of stress regarding job security

290

(rating of 6 or 7) made it more likely that the time bleeding would change (Supplementary

291

file, Figure 4). Of the 653 women not reporting high levels of job security stress, 34%

292

experienced changes in time bleeding compared to 54% of the 91 women reporting high

293

levels of stress. Fisher’s exact test suggested a significant relationship (p<.001). Of the 91

294

women reporting high levels of job security stress, 38 reported that they had maintained or

295

increased high-intensity exercise. Only 13 (34%) of these women reported changes in time

296

bleeding compared to 36 of the 53 women (68%) who either decreased or did not do high-

297

intensity exercise (p=0.003).

298

Most participants (75.0%) were not using any form of hormonal contraception. Over

299

half of the total sample (52.6%) indicated they experienced a change in their cycle length

300

during lock down. A quarter of the sample (25.3%) experienced increases in cycle length,

301

and~20% experienced a decrease. A change in bleeding time was reported by 267 (36%)

302

participants. Of the symptoms listed in figure 2, decision tree analysis (Supplementary file,

303

Figure 4) suggested that use of hormonal contraception was the biggest contributing factor in

304

whether cycle length had changed. Amongst the 558 of women that were not using hormonal

305

contraception, 58% noticed a change in cycle length, compared to 41% of the 187 who did

306

use hormonal contraception (Table 3), which was a significant difference (p<.001).

4. Discussion

310

The purpose of this research was to identify if exercising females had experienced a

311

change in their menstrual cycle throughout the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period.

312

Seven-hundred and forty-nine participant responses were included for final analysis, over

313

half of which cited a change in their menstrual cycle. Over one third of participants

314

experienced a change in bleeding patterns (35.6%). Secondly, the study aimed to identify the

315

main contributing factors to such changes in the menstrual cycle. The greatest contributing

316

factor to reported changes was stress. Some of the symptoms exacerbated by stress through

317

the COVID-19 pandemic can be off-set by increases in fruit and vegetable intake and

318

performing high intensity exercise. This study is the first to detail the implications of the

319

pandemic on the menstrual cycle of females. The data provided herein not only highlights the

320

importance of stress in relation to maintaining a consistent menstrual cycle but also provides

321

important detail for practitioners/clinicians when managing patients with irregularities of the

322

menstrual cycle.

323

Most menstrual cycle-associated symptoms that showed evidence of change during

324

the COVID-19 pandemic were psychosocial. Over half of all participants reported a change

325

in mood (54%), irritability (59.9%), emotional feeling (66.5%), worry (61.0%), feeling

326

distracted (56.6%), lack of concentration (56.9%), motivation (62.3%) and focus (55.7%).

327

These reported symptoms were consistent irrespective of whether the participant used a

328

hormonal contraceptive or whether cycle length had changed. Most Hormonal contraceptives

329

provide synthetic hormones to the body and regulate the menstrual cycle through synthetic

330

pathways (Elliott-Sale and Hicks, 2018), and are also associated with various symptoms and

331

side effects (Martin et al., 2017; Vitzthum and Ringheim, 2005; Nault et al., 2013). The data

332

here has shown that whilst the cycle length of a hormonal contraceptive user may not change

18

333

as readily in relation to the external environment, symptoms and side effects may still be

334

present and can be affected by environmental changes.

335

There were some differences in the symptoms reported between elite and sub-elite

336

athletes, compared to non-elite respondents. Fifty-four percent of elite female athletes

337

indicated that bloating was a symptom they had increasingly experienced during COVID-19

338

lockdown, which was significantly higher than the reported prevalence of bloating amongst

339

the other participants. This proportion is higher than previously reported amongst elite

340

athletes populations (Martin et al., 2017), suggesting the COVID-19 lockdown period is

341

likely to have contributed to this higher prevalence. Shunting of blood during exercise, away

342

from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract towards the muscles, may contribute to increased GI stress

343

in the form of bloating (ter Steege and Kolkman, 2012; Rehrer and Meijer, 1991) and could

344

provide explanation toward the increases in bloating experienced by elite athletes,

345

considering the higher levels of exercise they perform, and the increases in aerobic activity

346

reported by 40% of participants. Despite the differences between elite and non-elite athletes,

347

there was a clear overall change in bloating for all participants, which aligns with increasing

348

reports of the effects of stress and anxiety on the gut (Wilson, 2020; Whitehead et al., 1992;

349

Simpson and Stakes, 1987). It was also reported that higher level competitors may have been

350

less likely than other women to experience reductions in; sex drive, focus and motivation and

351

increases in; constipation, feeling emotional and lower back pain, compared to non-

352

competitive athletes, however this was not significant. Whilst elite sport competition has

353

been cancelled or postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, it is likely that these

354

athletes will have access to various additional support networks (Bowes, Lomax and

355

Piasecki, 2020) and thus are able to manage rapidly changing environments more so than

356

their non-elite counterparts.

357

Influences of nutritional intake and exercise on the menstrual cycle have been well

358

documented (Torstveit and Sundgot-Borgen, 2005; Hashim et al., 2019; De Souza et al.,

359

2017; Brown and Brown, 2010). During the past six months, across the globe, varying

360

degrees of lockdown have arisen, inevitably affecting the ability of many females to carry out

361

exercise. All sporting facilities were closed, and in some countries, restrictions have been

362

limited people to within a 1 km radius from their homes. During such a climate, nutritional

363

habits have inevitably changed (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2020;

364

Pellegrini et al., 2020). Our data report similar dietary changes. Not unexpectedly

365

participants reported to have increased alcohol intake, consumption of cooked and baked

366

goods and to have generally increased consumption of unhealthy foods, which is not

367

unsurprising given the evidence of comfort eating in heighted stress (Roberts, Campbell and

368

Troop, 2014; Klatzkin et al., 2019). Interestingly, an increase in dairy assumption was

369

associated with cycle length changes seen in hormonal contraceptive users only. This is

370

somewhat of an unexpected finding given the regularity of menstrual cycles that oral

371

contraceptives provide (Elliott-Sale and Hicks, 2018), although there is some possible

372

differences in efficacy and absorption between individuals taking oral contraceptives (Jung-

373

Hoffman and Kuhl, 1990), which could possibly explain why some oral contraceptive pill

374

users here still experienced cycle length changes. However, as we have no detailed

375

pharmacodynamics data associated with the questionnaire this cannot be validated within this

376

study.

377

The greatest contributor towards changes in symptoms was stress. There was a

378

significantly greater increase in symptoms when participants reported high levels of worry

379

about personal and family health. Similarly, bleeding time was more likely to have changed if

380

high level of stress regarding job security was reported. Interestingly, fruit and vegetable

381

intake were able to off-set some changes in cycle length associated with stress, and high

382

intensity training was able to regulate stress regarding job security. Clearly, the current

383

climate surrounding COVID-19 has been a stressful event for many (López et al., 2020;

384

Rehman et al., 2020; Odriozola-González et al., 2020). This data highlights the great impact

385

that such stress can have on female physiology, not solely on mental health and well-being.

386

Current education around such possible influencers on the menstrual cycle is quite limited

387

amongst the female population (Ayoola, Zandee and Adams, 2016; Larsen et al., 2020).

388

Given that the current climate is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, it is important

389

that females become aware of the influence that stress will have on the menstrual cycle and

390

are able to manage/control these changes to the best of their ability. It is deemed that long-

391

term stress could have a significant negative impact on fertility and female reproductive

392

health, (Palomba et al., 2018; Negro-Vilar, 1993; Sominsky et al., 2017), as well as the

393

suggestion that exacerbated stress can induce premature brain ageing (Prokai and Berga,

394

2016). Therefore, it is especially important for females of childbearing age, and clinicians

395

alike, to consider a number of possible factors, including stress, that could be contributing to

396

any presenting changes in the menstrual cycle. Interestingly, exercise and a balanced sound

397

nutritional intake were able to off-set some of the heightened stress, which aligns with what

398

is already recommended for dealing with extreme stressors (Chan et al., 2019; Paolucci et al.,

399

2018; Costigan et al., 2016; Ramón-Arbués et al., 2019; Owen and Corfe, 2017).

400

As with all research, there are limitations with this study that should be

401

acknowledged. The data herein comes from a range of countries in which there were a range

402

of rules and regulations, and therefore experiences, with regards to lockdown, therefore

403

possibly influencing the participants differently. However, the countries assessed in the study

404

all documented some degree of change in lifestyles and working environments. Our sample

405

also included hormonal contraceptive users as well as non-users. The regularity of cycles

406

when utilising combined oral contraceptives, due to exogenous hormones that they contain, is

407

well documented, thus including such participants may limit the numbers of females that

408

have seen cycle length changes. However, it was important not to exclude such females as it

409

is known 34 % of the general population (Cea-Soriano et al., 2014) and around 50% of elite

410

athletes (Martin et al., 2017) use such methods. Stress may not just change cycle length, it

411

can also contribute to symptoms experienced which we were able to document in both

412

hormonal contraceptive users and non-users. Finally, our data only provides a small insight

413

into the changes experienced by females during the COVID-19 pandemic and does not

414

provide any longitudinal data that could document the rise and fall of symptom exacerbation

415

or the degree of severity that the females may have been affected by such environmental

416

changes.

417

5. Conclusions

418

In conclusion, lifestyle changes experienced by females throughout the COVID-19

419

pandemic lockdown period can impact menstrual cycle length and symptoms. Over half of all

420

females reported a change in their cycle length and over a third experienced changes in

421

bleeding patterns. The most substantial changes arise in psychosocial symptoms, which is

422

somewhat expected given previously reported links between the pandemic lockdown period

423

and mental health. The stress caused by the pandemic is the most significant contributor to

424

menstrual cycle changes. This is important and highlights the potential for long-term stress to

425

influence female fertility and other health consequences. With the current uncertainty of the

426

COVID-19 pandemic, and a possibility of a second wave during the northern hemisphere

427

winter season, menstrual cycle changes could become a serious consequence. It is therefore

428

important to educate females about the influence of stress as well as to ensure clinicians are

429

fully aware of the reasons why menstrual cycle changes may arise.
