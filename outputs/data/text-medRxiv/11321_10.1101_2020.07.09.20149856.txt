ABSTRACT

26

Introduction: Venezuela and Colombia both adopted measures of containment early in

27

response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis

28

has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its

29

porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit

30

through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health

31

authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a

32

snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan

33

border region.

34

Methods: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from

35

nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline.

36

Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of

37

Named Global Outbreak LINeages ‘Pangolin’ tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-

38

CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform

39

comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference.

40

Results: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the

41

B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike

42

protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased

43

infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K/G204R

44

substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome.

45

Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages

46

from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and

47

from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including

48

lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3

49

Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring

50

borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the

51

complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities

52

should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced

53

populations within the region.

1. INTRODUCTION

58

As Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads throughout

59

the Western hemisphere, Latin America has become an epicenter for the Coronavirus

60

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Since the report on March 13, 2020 of the first two

61

cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in Venezuela, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the

62

country. The areas of highest transmission flank the Colombian-Venezuelan border, where

63

the reported incidence reaches 47,9% with a 34,2% case fatality rate (“Coronavirus

64

Venezuela,” n.d.)

65

Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has had a severe impact on its health care system:

66

the country has experienced a massive exodus of medical personnel, shortages of treatment

67

and supplies, as well as a systematic dismantling of public health infrastructure (Daniels,

68

2020). In addition, the increased poverty and violence, plus the abandonment of all

69

epidemiological surveillance programs, has set the stage for the re-emergence of vaccine-

70

preventable and vector-borne diseases (Grillet et al., 2019; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2019).

71

The Venezuelan public health system cannot withstand current autochthonous threats, let

72

alone emerging infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the political and

73

economic turmoil in Venezuela has precipitated one of the largest refugee crises witnessed

74

in the hemisphere. This has resulted in the establishment of disease corridors to neighboring

75

countries---particularly Colombia, which houses 1.4 million Venezuelan migrants (Daniels,

76

2020; Torres and Castro, 2019). Despite early implementation of lockdown and border

77

restrictions starting in March 2020, control of cross-border migration has remained a

78

challenge due to the length (approximately 2,219 km) of the Venezuelan-Colombian

79

border, and the unregulated transit of individuals through illegal trails known as “trochas”.

As of July 8th 2020, the majority of COVID-19 cases in Venezuela have been reported from

81

three border states, Apure, Táchira and Zulia. (“Estadísticas Venezuela | COVID-19 en

82

Venezuela,” n.d.).

83

Here we report sequences for three of five SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, representing the

84

first viral genomes from Venezuela, and providing a snapshot of the epidemiological

85

landscape across the Colombian-Venezuelan border.

86
87

2. METHODS

88

2.1.Patients, sampling and demographic data

89

Newly arrived migrants from Venezuela meeting case-definition criteria established by the

90

Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection were screened for SARS-CoV-2

91

infection at different hospitals and healthcare centers in Norte de Santander and Bolivar

92

Departments of Colombia between March 31st and May 1st, 2020. Molecular detection of

93

SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab specimens in viral transport media (NP-VTM) was

94

performed using the Berlin Charité protocol. SARS-CoV-2 -positive specimens from five

95

individuals who were tested within 24 hours of their arrival in Colombia were referred for

96

further characterization. Four of the five individuals already were symptomatic at the time

97

of arrival from Venezuela, and one was a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 patient.

98

Complete viral genomes were generated from specimens from three of these five cases. The

99

patients, aged 30 (♂), 42 (♂) and 56 (♀) years, came from different regions, Cucuta, Norte

100

de Santander, and Bolivar, (Fig 1A). Sequencing was unsuccessful for the other 2

101

specimens, most likely due to insufficient target material.

102

2.2.Phylogenetic analysis

103

We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from NP viral

104

transport medium (VTM) clinical specimens, as described previously (Gonzalez-Reiche et

105

al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2020). The data generated by high throughput sequencing was

106

assembled using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline (Gonzalez-Reiche et al., 2020).

107

The complete genomes were typed using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global

108

Outbreak LINeages ‘Pangolin’ tool (Rambaut et al., 2020).

109

A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes encompassing the lineage

110

diversity from South America were downloaded from the GISAID database for

111

comparative genomic analyses. These sequences were aligned in MAFFT (Katoh et al.,

112

2018), using the Wuhan-1 strain (NC_045512.2) as reference. The complete data set was

113

subjected to the same typing scheme using Pangolin tool. Thus far, 28 pangolin lineages

114

have been reported for SARS-CoV2 strains circulating in South American countries (Fig.

115

1B), with B1 as the predominant lineage representing 62.9% of the total reported genomes.

116

Four other lineages include B.1.5 (12.5%), A.5 (4.5%), A.2 and B (3.4% each) account for

117

an additional 23.8%. Each of the remaining 15 lineages accounted for fewer than 10

118

genomes, with several having only a single representative. A time-scaled maximum

119

likelihood (ML) phylogeny based on TreeTime built in IQTREE (Rambaut et al., 2016;

120

Sagulenko et al., 2018) revealed that there was no clustering by originating country in the

121

reconstruction, although a general clustering by pangolin lineages was observed (Fig. 1C).

122

These analyses are in agreement with the simultaneous circulation of SARS-CoV-2

123

lineages from different geographical origins.

124

A detailed screening of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in important open reading

125

frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2 was then conducted, and substitutions in Spike and

126

Nucleocapsid sequences were evaluated. The alignment was inspected using Ugene

127

(http://ugene.net/). The regions of interest were exported considering the ORFs described

128

for the reference strain Wuhan-1 (NC_045512.2), as previously described in NCBI:

129

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term = Severe + acute + respiratory + syndrome +

130

coronavirus + 2 + isolate + Wuhan-Hu-1.

131

3. RESULTS

132

We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained (VEN-89312 and VEN-95072)

133

were identical and belonged to the B1 lineage, while the third (VEN-95070) belonged to

134

the B.1.13 lineage, suggesting two separate introductions (Candido et al., 2020; Ramirez et

135

al., 2020). We analyzed the individual genomic information for the 3 Venezuelan viruses

136

reported in this study within the context of the larger global viral diversity to determine

137

potential dates for the introduction of SARS-CoV2 into Venezuela, and similarly for 3

138

viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia (Ramirez et al., 2020) (Table

139

1).

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two of the Venezuelan SARS-CoV-2 genomes (VEN-

145

95070 and VEN-95072) closely resembled genomes from neighboring Colombia (Cesar

146

and Norte de Santander Departments) (Ramirez et al., 2020) while the third (VEN-89312)

147

was related to genomes from Brazil (Fig. 1C) (Candido et al., 2020).

148

The three Venezuelan genomes carried a G-to-A point mutation at position 23,403 resulting

149

in a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein. This mutation characterizes the B.1

150

lineages and has been associated with enhanced viral entry into host cells, and potentially

151

with increasing infectivity and transmissibility (Bhattacharyya et al., 2020; Korber et al.,

152

2020).

153

Additionally, we identified three substitutions in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of VEN-89312

154

changing GGG-to-AAC at positions 28,616-28,618 resulting R203K/G204R substitutions

155

according to the whole-genome position after removing the 5´UTR. These R203K/G204R

156

substitutions, which have been reported previously in other South American genomes, were

157

absent from the two other Venezuelan genomes we sequenced. The alignment is shown

158

highlighting the SNPs found in the N gene (Fig. 1D) (Crooks et al., 2004).

4. DISCUSSION

160

The presence of mutations previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity

161

and transmissibility in the genomic sequences we determined for SARS-CoV-2 from both

162

Venezuela and neighboring border regions of Colombia may represent an additional

163

challenge for control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America. The spectre of a

164

SARS-CoV-2 variant with increased infectivity further complicates the already-complex

165

epidemiological landscape with its chronic limitations of biomedical understaffing, poor

166

healthcare infrastructure, limited or inadequate diagnostic capacities, and poor compliance

167

of the general population with disease containment measures (Miller et al., 2020).

168

Following the first report of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil in late February 2020 (Andrus et al.,

169

2020; Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020), SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the region,

170

resulting in nearly two million cases as of June 25th, 2020, with Brazil and Peru reporting

171

the highest burden of disease (“Epidemic Diseases - Cumulative suspected and confirmed

172

COVID-19 cases reported by countries and territories in the Americas,” n.d.).

173

Although Colombia and Venezuela both implemented early lockdown and containment

174

strategies since March 10th and March 17th, respectively, (“CORONAVIRUS (COVID-

175

19),” n.d., “Presidente Maduro anuncia que este martes todo el país entra en cuarentena

176

social • Ministerio del Poder Popular para Relaciones Exteriores,” n.d.), according to

177

current official records there have been over 124,500 COVID-19 cases in Colombia and

178

over 7,700 cases in Venezuela (“CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19),” n.d., “Estadísticas

179

Venezuela | COVID-19 en Venezuela,” n.d.). However, these numbers have to be

180

contextualized because: (i) Colombia has exclusively performed state-of-the-art RT-PCR-

181

based SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis whereas Venezuelan authorities have relied mostly on

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149856; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

10
182

serological testing that are considerably less specific (Chia et al., 2020) and less useful than

183

molecular methods for acute case detection; (ii) Venezuela has precarious epidemiological

184

surveillance and contact tracing systems; and (iii) Venezuela has reduced international

185

traffic through airports secondary to extensive departure of multiple airlines.

186

The concurrent humanitarian crisis has forced millions of Venezuelans to flee to

187

neighboring countries ---mainly Colombia--- seeking economic and social stability (Torres

188

and Castro, 2019; Tuite et al., 2018). Venezuelans with ongoing health issues also travel to

189

Colombia to obtain high-quality healthcare such as surgical procedures and hemodialysis

190

(Daniels, 2020). However, massive Venezuelan migration has resulted in an unprecedented

191

infectious disease exodus, representing one of the most concerning public health threats in

192

the region (Grillet et al., 2019; Torres and Castro, 2019). COVID-19 has deepened the

193

situation and has prompted xenophobia and further marginalization of Venezuelan migrants

194

and refugees at the Venezuelan-Colombian border (Daniels, 2020).

195

The shared presence of B lineages in SARS-CoV-2 from Venezuela and Colombia

196

reinforces the close interactions of persons living in border regions and the difficulty of

197

containment across a porous border. Similarly, the detection of the B.1.13 lineage, only

198

previously described in cases in Spain, England and Australia (Batty et al., 2020) further

199

underlines the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 through interconnected populations.

200

Additionally, the presence of substitution D614G in the spike protein of the three viruses

201

from patients residing in the current hotspots of COVID-19 in Venezuela may correlate

202

with the reported increased infectivity (Korber et al., 2020) observed in SARS-CoV-2-

203

infected patients in the state of Zulia (“Zulia suma 15 muertes confirmadas por coronavirus

204

y seis no reportadas - Efecto Cocuyo,” n.d.).

11
205

An important limitation to our study is that the limited number of genomes currently

206

available from Venezuela could potentially result in sampling bias. Given the difficulty in

207

obtaining samples, the extent to which our findings truly reflect Venezuela’s overall

208

phylogenetic landscape remains to be determined. Future studies are needed to expand the

209

SARS-CoV-2 genome repertoire in Venezuela and related areas, and to enable better

210

understanding of the interplay between genotype and phenotype, and their relevance for

211

disease surveillance and containment.

212

5. CONCLUSION

213

The Venezuelan humanitarian and refugee crisis, coupled with uncontrolled migration

214

across the Colombian-Venezuelan border, is a devastating reminder of the potential effects

215

of infectious disease spillover on the already vulnerable public health systems of

216

neighboring countries. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread across Latin America, public

217

health authorities and the international community should carefully follow the impact of the

218

pandemic on displaced populations. Intensive efforts are urgently needed to help minimize

219

the impact of Venezuela's crisis on the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

distribution of the sequences from Venezuelan genomes and the available Colombian

354

genomes analyzed in this study. The pink symbols indicate the Venezuelan patients

355

identified in Colombia with their respective Venezuelan state origin. B. Stacked bar plot of

356

the number of genomes per lineage determined using Phylogenetic Assignment of Named

357

Global Outbreak LINeages ‘Pangolin’ tool. Three SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela

358

were compared with 376 assemblies from other 7 South American countries (Argentina,

359

Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay) using the publicly available GISAID

360

EpiCoVTM database (https://www.gisaid.org/). Frequencies are discriminated by country of

361

origin. The Venezuelan lineages are identified by black arrows. C. Maximum likelihood

362

tree built in IQtree shows the phylogenetic relationships between genomes from Venezuela

363

(pink dots) and the closest Colombian regions (yellow dots) with other South American

364

genomes. The branches were colored according to the country of origin, using the color

365

code of A panel. The clustering of the most frequent pangolin lineages (n> 10) is

366

represented on the right side. The black dots represent highly supported nodes. D. Multiple
