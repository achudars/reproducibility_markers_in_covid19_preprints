Abstract
COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer
regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines,
control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions,
comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions,
among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential
establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 published governmental interventions, and population
adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian
states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a

time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of
enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the
changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility
reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by
governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare
the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our
results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations
plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions and represents
a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income
countries.

1. Introduction
COVID-19, a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, emerged
in December 2019 in China and was recognized as a pandemic by the World
Health Organization on March 11, 2020 [1]. At that moment, Brazil had
already confirmed 53 cases. On March 20, with 972 confirmed cases, the
Brazilian Ministry of Health recognized community transmission of COVID19 throughout the national territory, 24 days after the first confirmed case
of COVID-19 was identified [2]. Brazil is a country with 209.5 million individuals and stark socioeconomic disparities throughout its territory. It is the
largest country in South America and the fifth largest nation in the world.
Accordingly, the many challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic are
unprecedented in this country.
The political-administrative organization of Brazil comprises three spheres
of governance: The Union (federal government), the 27 states (including the
Federal District, where the capital city, Brasilia, is located) and 5,570 municipalities. To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, federal, state and city
governments implemented a series of interventions by means of government
decrees [3]. This included recommendations to identify and isolate confirmed
cases and contacts; to restrict unnecessary movements; to practice social distancing; to increase hygiene awareness; to follow respiratory etiquette; to

wear masks in public, among others. In the absence of more intensive mitigation policies implemented by the federal government (such as lock-downs
and movement restrictions), most measures were adopted by local governments (state/municipalities) [3]. However, adherence to these policies varied
greatly throughout the country, and while some regions enacted more strict
controls, others have been more lax.
The COVID-19 crisis has called attention to the importance of mathematical modeling to inform governmental policies and in quantifying the effects
of the pandemic at multiple levels [4]. Models have been adapted to address questions such as the role of asymptomatic individuals to SARS-CoV-2
transmission chains [5], to assess the effectiveness of testing and quarantine
strategies in informing economic reopening [6] and epidemic suppression by
partial lockdown strategies [7], to quantify the needs for hospital beds under
various social distancing scenarios [8, 9, 10], among others, eg. [11, 12, 13, 14].
By drawing on a generalized SEIR model that simulates the dynamics of viral spread in a population entirely susceptible to the new virus, it is possible
to define and estimate the transmission rate (TR) at which an infected individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible person [15]. Therefore,
the higher this rate, the greater the number of new cases in a region over
time. Downward changes on the TR are expected with the implementation
of mitigation policies such as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), the
only option to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of effective
therapies or vaccination with sufficient population coverage.
In this work, we comparatively analyze the evolution of the COVID-19
transmission rate and effective reproduction number across all 27 Brazilian
states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities, establishing links with measures of governmental restrictions (NPIs) implemented
in each region together with the human behavior response, particularly the
adherence to recommendations of social distancing. The varying degree of enforced policies across the country offers an opportunity to study the impacts
of interventions, including their breadth and timing, on the TR of SARSCoV-2 throughout Brazilian states. These findings can be extrapolated to
similar settings in other low- and middle-income countries to drive improvements in mitigation policies against subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2 and
other potentially pandemic pathogens.

2. Methodology
Data sources
The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for each Brazilian municipality, up to May 22, 2020, was obtained from the Ministry of Health of
Brazil and are publicly available [16, 17]. Since the capitals of each state have
different dynamics and largely concentrated COVID-19 cases in the initial
wave of the epidemic (an assumption informed by previous works [18, 19]),
we analyzed the transmission dynamics for each state in the following way:
1) The entire state, 2) the state capital alone; and 3) the remaining state
municipalities grouped as a single place by summing up their reported cases.
Throughout the text we refer to the latter as inland cities, although strictly
not all of these are distant from the shore.
To evaluate state-wide enforced governmental measures, we collated government decrees and resolutions scattered throughout various state government gazettes and other official repositories up to May 22, 2020, since each
state uses different platforms to communicate their legislation. We annotated the type of measure enforced, the implementation date, the duration
and whether it was valid to the whole state or limited to specific regions (see
Supplementary Material).
In addition to state level decrees we also collated COVID-19-related federal regulations, which affect equally all states [20]. However, federal-level
regulations did not interfere on measures enforced by state or municipalities,
and most of them were later repealed. Indeed, on April 8, 2020 the Brazilian
Federal Supreme Court ruled in favor of the decentralization of operations
aimed at controlling COVID-19 in the country, empowering the actions of
state and municipal governments [21]. The evaluation of municipal-level regulations was not performed due to the large number of Brazilian cities, a total
of 5,570, each having their own system for publications of legislation, with
variable degrees of update frequency and usually providing unstructured data
and burdensome access options, which would make their manual processing
unpractical. For this reason, in this work we only considered regulations
issued by the 27 state governments, which totaled 707 decrees.
As a proxy of the population adherence to recommendations of social
distancing, we used information from InLoco [22], a Brazilian technology
start-up that developed an index of social mobility, which seeks to help in
fight the pandemic in Brazil. Data for the index construction is obtained
from the unidentified, aggregated geo-movement patterns extracted from 60

million mobile devices throughout the country. The index ranges from 0 to
100% and measures the proportion of devices from a given municipality that
remained within a 450 meter radius from the location identified as home by
the device. The higher the index, the greatest the population adherence to
social distancing recommendations. The data is available at [22]. Examples
of other works that used the Social mobility reduction index (SMRI) can be
found in [23, 24].
Stringency Index
To comparatively evaluate the governmental measures implemented by
the Brazilian states, we constructed a stringency index, denoted by ι, similarly to that implemented in [25]. To score each employed policy we adapted
the methodology to the Brazilian context by taking into account the specific
measures established by the different state governments and described in the
Data Sources section.
Measures were classified into two categories: Ordinal and cumulative.
Ordinal class of measures, denoted by O, are those in which there is a clear
order on the intensity of the restriction, so that there are less possibilities
of reclassification. For instance, a decree prohibiting agglomerations of more
than 100 people, followed by a second decree restricting to 500 people, belong
to the ordinal category, where the first is more intense than the second.
Cumulative class of measures, denoted by C, are those with no clear order of
intensity, allowing for a wide range of possibilities to classify the restriction.
For instance, closure of malls and prohibition to accessing parks and beaches
have no clear order to which of these measures is more intense and may lead
to subjective classification.
Every class of measures is a collection of sub-measures depending on how
each government decided to response and enforce measures. In this work
we have seven classes of measures, of which four are ordered and three are
cumulative, further described in Supplementary Table 1. Cancellation of
public events (O1 ) presents six sub-measures. Similarly, health etiquette
policies (C1 ) has two sub-measures.
The evaluation of the ordered class of measures varies from 0 (when no
measure is applied) to j (when the most stringent sub-measure is applied),
where the index j varies from 0 to NOi , the number of sub-measures of the
ordinal class of measures Oi (we similarly denote NCi , as the number of submeasures for the cumulative class). For the cumulative class of measures,
we evaluate each sub-measure as 0 if the sub-measure was not applied or

1 otherwise, so that the value of the class will be the sum of points of the
sub-measures sCi . Additionally, to take into account whether the measure
was enforced for the whole state or limited to a particular region, each class
has a target G. If the measure is ordinal, then we consider G = GOi , taking
either the value 0, if the most stringent sub-measure is applied for specific
areas of the state, or 1, if it is enforced for the whole state. If the measure
is cumulative, and since it will be a sum of the sub-measures, then G = GCi
is the sum of targets for each sub-measure sGCi , which again is either 0 if
the sub-measure is applied to specific areas or 1 if it is applied to the whole
state without exceptions. A summary of the seven measures, as well as their
number of sub-measures and targets are presented in Table 1.

Thus, the value of the stringency ιOi is the value of the most stringent measured applied, j, normalized by the number of sub-classes, NOi , multiplied

The mathematical model
We generalize the usual SEIR model by separating the infectious compartment into two: Asymptomatic/non-detected and symptomatic cases, denoted
by Ia and Is , respectively, following our previous modeling strategy [8]. It
is reasonable to consider that the compartment Ia encompasses many of the
sub-notified cases since the majority of asymptomatic and mild cases are
not accounted for in the official data, in spite of their important role to the
SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain [5]. The system of differential equations

The epidemiological parameters presented in Equations (1 - 5) are described
in Table 2, along with their estimates (or search ranges, when fitted), which
were informed by previous works.
As described in [8], the parameter δ, a factor associated with the infectivity of asymptomatic/non-detected infections, plays an important role on
the viral transmission dynamics. As described by equation 1, it influences
the non-linear term, and thus cannot be neglected from the system, unless it
is assumed that the infectivity of asymptomatic individuals is equivalent to
that of symptomatic cases, ie. δ = 1. However, several studies suggest δ < 1
[5, 29, 32], which guided our modeling choice that defined the search interval
for this parameter (Table 2).

Additionally, to account for variations in the TR over time, we assume
that the TR β is a function given by:

where {t1 , t2 , . . . , tn } represent a set of points in time defining the change on
the TR, βi are TRs in the interval [ti , ti+1 ], and H(x) = 1 if x > 0, H(x) = 0
if x < 0 and H(x) = 1/2 if x = 0.
The key novelty here is that the influence of governmental measures on
social mobility and human behavior can dictate changes on the TR (βi ’s) on
inferred points ti ’s. To do so, we assume that the ti ’s change in an interval search based on variations in stringency and social mobility, described
previously. Additionally, to evaluate if one or more changes to the transmission rate was required, we assessed the value obtained using the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) as well as by visual evaluation of the fitted results. The visual evaluation is important since the calculation of the BIC
may yield small variations when the number of parameters is increased due
to the inherent noise in the data.
The time of changing transmission rate and the rate itself, as well as the
δ parameter are estimated using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
metaheuristic. Under the PSO framework, we used maximum likelihood estimation to optimize the model to the series of daily confirmed cases for
each state, capital cities and remaining inland cities up to May 22, 2020.
PSO was implemented using pyswarms library version 1.1.0 for Python 3
(http://python.org) [38], and was executed with 150 particles through 500
iterations with cognitive parameter 0.1, social parameter 0.3, inertia parameter 0.9, evaluating five closest neighbors through Euclidean (or L2)

distance metric. In addition to the point estimates obtained by the PSO
method, percentile confidence intervals were also estimated for these parameters. The intervals were constructed using the weighted non-parametric
bootstrap method, considering 100 replicates of the original series of new
cases. Similar work to evaluate the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures
on the TR and dynamic spread of the disease are presented in [27, 28, 39].
The parameters p, κ, γa , γs were informed by the literature and kept fixed.
The remaining estimated model parameters and search intervals were informed both by the literature and the analyses presented in this work, and
are presented in Table 2.
Basic and effective reproduction number
Based on the obtained parameter values we also evaluated the basic reproductive number R0 and the effective reproductive number R(t), also denoted
by Rt , as described in [8]. The basic reproductive number R0 characterizes
the disease spread during the very early time interval after it has been introduced, thus it is evaluated on the first transmission rate estimated by the
model. Its expression is given by (see [8, 40, 41]):

R0 =

We also obtain the time series of the effective reproductive number R(t),
which indicate the current trend of the epidemic. Details of this calculation
can be found in Supplementary Note 5 of our previous work [8]. By writing
the infection-age structured epidemic model of our system of equations (1)
to (5) [40, 42], we obtain:
R(t) =

Equation (8) would be similar to the general form given by R(t) = R0 S(t)
only for a portion of the evaluated period, since we consider changes on time
in the transmission rate β and the R0 expression only takes into account the
transmission rate before the first change, that is, for t < t1 .
Additionally, equation (8) can be also given by:

where the numerator b represents daily number of new cases and the denominator corresponds to the convolution on b and g, that is the disease
probability distribution function for the time interval between the infection
of an individual and its secondary cases. The function g is derived from the
differential equations of the model and receives contributions from the three
compartments E, Ia , Is that impact the evaluation of R0 and R(t), as presented in [8]. The advantage of equation (9) is that it allow us to evaluate
the effective reproduction number directly on the available data and g, a
probability distribution function that can take different shapes and makes
our result more flexible to compare directly with the data, being δ the only
estimated necessary parameter used to feed equation (9).
Finally, since the data are reported as daily case counts, to calculate

3. Results
The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the Brazilian states
Brazil had a total of 334,555 registered COVID-19 cases up to May 22,
2020. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil occurred in the state of
São Paulo, southeastern region, on February 26, 2020. Within an interval of
seven to 12 days (from March 4 to March 9) the states10 of ES, DF, BA, AL,
RJ and MG had confirmed cases of COVID-19. From March 10 to March 25
the disease spread to the remaining 20 Brazilian states (Figure 1A).
By the moment that state authorities were unable to relate confirmed
cases through chains of transmission, SARS-CoV-2 community transmission
began to be declared in each region (Figure 1A; Supplementary Table 2).
Supplementary Figure 1 shows the temporal variation from the first reported
case to the declaration of community transmission in the state. As depicted
in Supplementary Figure 1, 40.7% (11/27) of the states took between 0 and
10 days to declare community transmission, 51.9% (14/27) took between 11
and 30 days, while only two states (Tocantins and Roraima), corresponding
to 7.5%, took more than 30 days to declare community transmission. This
scenario is further complicated by the delays in reporting cases. Although
each state declared community transmission at some point, there are uncertainties around these dates due to delays in both the registration of cases and
the communication from the local level (municipality) to state authorities,
as exemplified in the states of Paraná and Roraima [44, 45].
In the supplemental web-page (see Data availability section), we present
the incidence of COVID-19 for each state, capitals and inland cities. As
shown, in the early stage of the pandemic in Brazil, the North region was
the most affected, accounting for the highest incidence, followed by CE and
MA in the Northeastern region. Once the entry of the virus was confirmed
within each state, the capitals were the most affected cities initially [19, 18],
emerging as the epicenter of the epidemic in each state (see Supplementary
Figures 2 and 3). Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 disseminated throughout the

Governmental measures and population adherence
Next, we evaluated the timing of governmental interventions on the number of cases, the breadth of these interventions as measured by the stringency
index, and their effects on influencing people’s behavior, particularly adhe12

sion to social distancing recommendations.
A total of 707 regulations published by the 27 Brazilian state governments
were annotated according to the methods described to construct the stringency index. The first measures enforcement of the state governments were
implemented between March 11 and March 24, with exception of MT that
present a larger time window interval, as shown in Figure 1A and Supplementary Table 2. The states of TO, RR, PI, PA, MT, AP, RO, MA, PB and
AC adopted measures even before the first registered case. In contrast, some
regions which were first affected by COVID-19 were among those that delayed the implementation of measures to contain viral spread. For instance,
São Paulo adopted measures only 2 weeks after the confirmation of the first
case, on March 13, the same day of community transmission declaration in
the state. A similar scenario occurred in Rio de Janeiro, where the first restriction measures were only implemented in parallel to the declaration of
community transmission.
Among the measures classified in Table 1, strict quarantine measures
(O4 ), restrictions on public transportation (C3 ) and mandatory use of mask
(C3 ) were the most weakly implemented measures enforced by the states.
Such measures contributed to an average level of 14% in stringency in the
studied period, and were adopted only partially in AP, BA, CE, MA and MT.
Only an average of 16.9% of public transportation measures were applied in
states. In the collected decrees, SP, DF and MS did not enact restrictions on
public transport and PA, PB, PI, RN, GO and ES had a very low average
of 4% in such measures. On the other hand, the mandatory use of masks
contributed, in average, to 33% of the index, with only one state (MS) failing
to enact such measures (Supplementary Table 3).
To assess the dynamics of implementation, continuance and lifting of NPIs
by Brazilian states, Figure 2 shows the variation of the stringency index over
time for each region relative to the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths
per 100,000 inhabitants. All states increased stringency after an incidence of
10 cases per 100k inhabitants. In addition, the states of AP, AM, RR, CE
and PE displayed the highest stringency index in the last period evaluated.
Of note, those states were close to reaching full occupancy of their health
care systems, with more than 75% of ICU occupation [46]. These results
evidenced that heightening the level of measures only when the number of
cases and hospitalizations is already mounting represents a flawed strategy
unable to avert the impacts of a surge of COVID-19 in healthcare demands.
Variable adherence to social isolation recommendations was seen across

the states, with values of the SMRI close to 30% at the beginning of March,
followed by a peak to around 60% at the end of that month. This was
observed in both state capitals and inland cities. The evolution of the stringency index for each state, as well as the SMRI for capitals and inland cities
is presented in the lower panel plots of Supplementary Figure 2 an 3, as well
as in the supplementary web-page. Used in conjunction, both measures offer a quantitative evaluation of the degree of policies enforced by Brazilian
state governments, as well as their effectiveness in reducing the circulation
of people, which lead to decreased contacts. Our results showed that, once
the SMRI reached its maximum, it was followed by a decreasing trend even
with the maintenance of measures by state governments.
With respect to the breadth and intervention period of governmental
measures, our results led to the identification of three stringency index pat-

terns: 1) Increase-and-decrease (ID), where the stringency index increases
initially, but is followed by the lifting of measures leading to its reduction
(such as Santa Catarina in Figure 3a); 2) Increase-and-steady (IS), where
stringency measures reach a peak that remains constant over time (depicted
by São Paulo in Figure 3b); 3) Increase-and-increase (II), where the stringency index increases successively, probably a mechanism to cope with the
accelerated growth of the epidemic in some regions (illustrated by Amapá in
Figure 3c). Seven states, all located in the North (AC, AP and AM) and
Northeast (BA, CE, PE and PI), followed the II pattern, while seven states,
distributed throughout the Midwest (GO, MT), South (RS, SC), Southeast
(ES) and North (RO, TO) regions conform to the ID pattern (Supplementary Figure 2 and 3). The remaining 13 states (AL, DF, MA, MG, MS, PA,
PB, PR, RJ, RN, RR, SE and SP), distributed in all regions, followed the IS
pattern. In addition, our results indicated that the reduction of the SMRI
was smaller in states that followed both IS and II patterns (median reduction of -7.55% and -5.88%, respectively), compared to states that relaxed
their measures according to the ID pattern (median reduction of -9.03%)
(Figure 3d).
Of note, even states that promoted relaxation of policies, such as those
that followed an ID pattern, maintained an average SMRI in the last week of
May corresponding to 40.1 ± 2.0%, a value higher than that corresponding
to the pre-pandemic SMRI in the first week of February, corresponding to a
value of 28.7 ± 1.4%.
Varying transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil
Lastly, we sought to comparatively evaluate the effects of governmental
measures and population adherence to social distancing recommendations in
the TR of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Brazilian states.
As shown earlier, states reported initial cases of COVID-19 and announced community transmission at different moments. Then, all regions
reached a peak of measures implemented and corresponding SMRI on March,
2020. By evaluating these metrics in all of the 81 regions analyzed (state,
capitals, inland cities), we defined the search interval for a possible first
change in the transmission rate from March 13, to May 15, to include the
date of the first measure enforced and the last announcement of community
transmission (see Figure 1a). When more than one change in the TR took
place, we defined the search interval to the last month of the studied period,

model. Our results show that 26% of the states (BA, RN, DF, MG, RJ, RS
and SC) presented a noticeable change in the TR up to 15 days after the
implementation of the first NPI, 40.7% between 16 and 30 days, 14.8% (PA,
PB, PE, PI) between 31 and 45 days and the remaining 18.5% (AC, RO, RR,
AL and MS) of the states had a TR change only more than 46 days since the
first implemented measure. Estimate TR changes occurred first in capitals,
followed by inland cities (Supplementary Table 4).
The dynamic behaviour post intervention can be classified into DDD,
DDI, DID, IDI and III, corresponding to decrease or increase in TR in the
state as a whole, capital and inland, respectively. Around 62% of the states
presented a DDD behavior, that is a decrease on the TR in the state, capital
and inland cities. These states had an average TR decrease higher in the
capitals (-49.67%) compared to the inland cities (-40.43%). The states of
AP, RO, AL and RS (14.8%) displayed a DDI pattern, with an increase in
cases observed for inland cities in May, 2020. On the other hand, the states of
PI and SC showed an increase of the TR in capitals and an observed decrease
in both state-level and inland cities (DID pattern). AC was the only state
with an IDI pattern, while the remaining states (TO, SE and MS) presented
with an III pattern. However, TO and SE later resembled a DDD pattern
with a second change in TR. Furthermore, all states with an increase in TR
in any of its regions (state, capital or inland cities) had either an ID or IS
for the stringency index (as noted in the previous subsection).
In Figure 1B we show values for the basic reproduction number for each
region. The lowest values of R0 were for the regions that presented an increased TR, as showed before. For instance, TO and SE presented values of
R0 < 1. This indicates the lower transmission in the early stage of the disease spread in these states. The state of MS, that also had and III pattern,
and the inland cities of SC all had the following lowest values of R0 (less than
1.5). The inland cities of AC, AL, RO and RS showed values between 1.5 and
2. The remaining states that presented with a DDD pattern for the TR had
R0 > 2. Additionally, we can see that states that implemented the measures
before the first reported case usually experienced delayed changes in the TR
(after 8 April) compared to the remaining states and, with exception of AP,
these states were the ones with an average lower value of R0 as well.
To conclude, changes in the TR also impacted on the effective reproduction number causing an average reduction of -56.44% in capitals and of
-46.43% in inland cities, after the first TR change In Figure 4 we show this
impact for each state, their capitals and inland cities. Although a decrease

in the average Rt after the first TR reduction was observed in most of the
states, in none of the regions the values of Rt fell below one. Moreover, after
the first TR change, the average level of Rt was equal to 1.86 in the inland
cities compared to 1.53 in capitals.

In this work we evaluated the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions
and social mobility reduction patterns on the spread dynamics of SARSCoV-2 throughout the 27 Brazilian states, by employing an underlying SEIR
model to estimate the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show
that the measures adopted, combined with the population adherence to restrict circulation (and therefore decrease contacts), contributed to the lowering of the TR in almost all states, an effect that was perceived in both
capitals and inland cities. However, in spite of the continued maintenance of
governmental restrictions in most regions, population adherence to isolation
recommendations gradually decreased over time, even with the expansion of
cases throughout the country. This was reflected in the R(t) values, which
we observed to have decreased in all states, but still insufficiently to consider
SARS-CoV-2 transmission controlled in the country, as it remained above 1
for all Brazilian states, capital and inland cities in the studied period. Thus,
public cooperation constitutes a particularly important challenge for tackling
COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.
The analysis performed on the sub-measures implemented reveal that the
Brazilian states lacked to endure measures restricting transportation (or did
so in a very lax manner), strict lock-downs (as adopted by other countries),
and even the mandatory use of masks at some places, the latter a low cost
measure that plays an important rule to reduce the spread of the disease.
Such restrictive policies have shown to significantly decrease the number of

cases, deaths, and viral transmission in other countries [47, 48]. On the
other hand, the economical costs imposed by harsher interventions is even
more burdensome to developing countries, where large economical segments
rely on consumption and services, usually involving physical contact, such as
informal workers, tourism, service and retail businesses.
Once the entry of the virus was confirmed within each state, the capitals
were the most affected initially, as shown by others as well [19, 18]. Then,
viral spread continued at different rates, with most of inland cities presenting
an average effective reproduction number higher than the capital after the
first TR change. This is a concerning trend considering the large inequalities
in the access to health services as well as their distribution in Brazil [49,
50], which tend to concentrate near state capitals. We also observed that
downward changes on TRs occurred first in the capitals, followed by the
remaining cities. This effect can also be due to the flux between cities,
which was not accounted in our modeling approach. Accordingly, the TR
observed in capitals should also affect that of inland cities, as suggested by
a meta-population compartmental model [51], but the possibility of further
waves of COVID-19 in these smaller cities, particularly with the lifting of
measures, should not be ruled out. These results highlight the major role of
state capitals as seeding spots, followed by the entry of cases towards smaller,
inland cities. Capitals also tend to centralize international airports, ports,
population density and industries [52, 53, 18, 54].
We identified common trends in the stringency index that allowed the
disclosure of three patterns, with the majority of states conforming to an
increase-and-steady pattern, in which the set of governmental policies adopted
remained unaltered over time. States that enforced and maintained mitigation measures were likely to observe a less pronounced relaxation of stay-athome advises by their population, as measured by the SMRI. These results
suggest the intimate relationship between the magnitude of governmental
measures and the population adherence to such measures, particularly since
higher values of stringency implicate in decreased opportunities of public
activities. However, individuals throughout all states, in both capitals and
inland cities, still reduced their adherence to social isolation in the course of
time. The politicization of COVID-19 in Brazil [55] could have had an impact
on people’s behavior and compliance with sanitary recommendations, particularly when individuals downplay the health risks imposed by SARS-CoV-2,
as has been suggested for other countries [56].

decrease stringency index pattern, at least a part of the population still
maintained adherence to isolation. More studies are warranted to evaluate if
this trend associates with specific age-groups, such as the elderly, employment
status, such as individuals that have the possibility to continue working from
home, education level or perception of risks around COVID-19.
The present study confirmed the findings about early implementation of
interventions to mitigate the disease spread [28, 39]. In fact, the states that
anticipated applied restriction of the population were the ones with lower
value of R0 , representing a more controlled situation if compared to the
other states. Nevertheless, with few exceptions, they were states that had
an ID or IS pattern of mobility, and therefore the efforts were not sufficient
to bring the transmission rate to control levels, as assessed by the Rt values. However, even with late TR change detection in these states, overall
delays must be noticed. In fact, in the scenario of an unfolding epidemic,
the delay in notification systems impacts the perception of the usefulness of
implemented measures. Our results reveal the magnitude of this perception,
where only 26% of the states showed a change on the TR with a maximum
delay of 15 days for the perception of the first peak of enforced policies,
with the remaining states having a significantly larger delay. These results
call attention to this problem and highlight the importance of improving the
surveillance system to better evaluate the impact of implemented measures
and optimise their strictness specially in countries with very low resource
levels [57].
Our work has some limitations. First, in order to estimate TRs (and
changes thereof) we relied upon a generalized form of the SEIR model which
explicitly considers asymptomatic/non-detected infections. Thus, albeit the
estimates of model parameters (or their respective search intervals) were informed by the literature for other countries, they could be different from
the reality of the ongoing epidemic in Brazil. However, while the true extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic/non-detected and presymptomatic individuals is still debated, current reports conclude that it is
an important route of transmission [5, 58, 33]. It is important to note that
levels of COVID-19 detection may vary over time due to the differing testing
capacity of each region, a data that to our knowledge is currently unavailable for the country. Our reflects this issue by the parameter p. However, the
availability of data about the number of tests performed over time is a limitation. Also, there are noticeable notification delays that also present with
different magnitudes throughout the regions in Brazil. In fact, Brazil has a

total of 5,570 municipalities, this generates heterogeneities on the reporting
date of the case notification. A systematic analysis to infer the reporting delay would require availability of data to at least measure a mean report delay
interval, as others have done [28]. Additionally, this delay may change over
time due to improvement or deterioration in the healthcare system. These are
key points that should be included to overcome this type of bias and correctly
estimate its uncertainties. This limitation may impact on the perception of
the implemented measures as well as compromise the planning of new ones.
However, our work further motivates the importance of an improved notification system for Brazil and other countries, which will contribute to better
mitigate the current and future pandemics.
We used mobility data from mobile phones as proxies of social isolation
as measured by the SMRI. In particular, the sample space of devices monitored using this technology cannot be considered a representative population
sample, as state/cities with superior economic status will probably exhibit
increased technology adoption by their populations, leading to better accuracy of the mobility patterns in these regions. This is in contrast to rural
areas, for instance, where mobile phone usage is limited [59]. However, considering the general widespread use of mobile phones in the country (with
estimates that 60% of adults report owning a smartphone [60]), the general
trends observed in our work should not be drastically altered by more accurate measurements of social mobility reduction. Lastly, the evaluation of all
measures enforced is not trivial, and in our work we have only included the
use of mask as health etiquette policies, with other NPIs such as sanitary
cleaning of public and private places, the obligatory availability of 70% alcohol in stores, as well as economic measures such as emergency payments for
the self-employed, reduction of taxes and others were not evaluated. Still,
proper evaluation of these categories should be assessed.
In sum, our results point to the importance of timely deployment of interventions in curbing the first-wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil.
Yet, population adherence represents a crucial factor for the success of this
effort and represents a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries.

In this type of measure there is a well-defined order, it is a simple calculation. Scenarios for an ordered measure with N = 3 is shown in Supplementary
Table 6.

A more restrictive measure applied in only in few regions has less value
than a slightly less restrictive measure applied across the state, as we see in
scenarios 3 and 4 above.
Cumulative measure
In this case, the evaluation of the cumulative measure Ci is the sum of
the restrictions applied, and Gci is the sum of the targets, N is the number
of possible restrictions, counting with no restrictions. An example for a
cumulative measure is shown in Supplementary Table 7.

Parameter sensitivity analysis
In this section, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the effects
of the mathematical model parameters in the dynamics of S, E, Ia , Is and
R compartments over time. By using an statistical variance-based method,
described by Sobol (2001) [83], the sensitivity analysis of the SEIR model
considers the following parameter vector
θ := (β0 , β1 , β2 , δ, t1 , t2 ) ∈ R6 ,

637

(11)

assuming that its elements are uniformly distributed (U) in proper intervals:
β0 ∼ U(0, 2), β1 ∼ U(0, 2), β2 ∼ U(0, 2),
δ ∼ U(0, 0.7), t1 ∼ U(ti1 , tf1 ), t2 ∼ U(ti2 , tf2 ).

641
642
643
644

645
646
647
648
649

Note that the range of uniform distribution with respect to t1 and t2 varies
according to the Brazilian states. In Fig. 5, the analysis is performed considering the Brazilian state of Distrito Federal as an example. For this example, the intervals for t1 and t2 are given as follows: t1 ∼ U(0, 50) and
t2 ∼ U(30, 57). Despite the different dates of community transmission between the Brazilian states, the influence of the analyzed parameters presented
in Fig. 5, remains equivalent in relation to the other states.
The method
To apply the statistical variance-based method, sample values is generated for the input factors shown in Eq. (11) by creating matrices A and B,
each with size N × n, where N is the number of samples and n = 6 is the
number of parameters being analyzed, given by

In the matrices A, B and AiB , each row represents a set of parameter to
be used as an input for the model. Numerical simulations are performed, and
the output of the sample matrices A, B and AiB are stored as the vectors

where YA , YB and YAiB are output vectors.
The final step involves the calculation of the sensitivity indices, using the
samples generated during the sampling scheme. We computed the total effect
indices, given by
YA · YB − f 2
STi = 1 −

YA · YA − f 2

This index indicates the contribution of the parameter to the output of the
model. The importance of each parameter i is proportional to the value of
STi , meaning that higher STi leads to a higher contribution to the model
output [84]. Parameters with higher ST need a more carefully calibration, as
small error during the calibration can lead to larger errors to the predictions
generated by the model. The total effect takes into account higher-order
interactions among model variables; thus, correlation between variables can
also be identified using this method. In addition, we also evaluated the influence of first-order effects, which do not consider interactions among variables,
to the model output.

Parameter sensitivity analysis: discussion
In Figure 5, the result of the sensitivity analysis over time is presented.
The numerical simulations were performed using SALib library [85]. The
experiment was conducted generating N = 15,000 parameter combinations,
totaling 120,000 simulations of the model, and the result shows the evolution
of the parameters according to S, E, Ia , Is and R compartments.
