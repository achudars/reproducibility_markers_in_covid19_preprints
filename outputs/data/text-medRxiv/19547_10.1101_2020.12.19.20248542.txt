1 Abstract
Background Analyses in hospitalized patients and small autopsy series suggest that severe SARS‐CoV‐2
infection may affect the heart. We investigated heart tissue by in situ hybridization,
immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and
characterize cardiac involvement in COVID‐19.
Methods Left ventricular tissue from 95 deceased with diagnosed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection undergoing
autopsy was analyzed and clinical data were collected. RNA was isolated to examine virus load of SARS‐
CoV‐2 and its replication in the heart. A virus load >1000 copies per µg RNA was defined as relevant.
Viral RNA and inflammatory cells were assessed using histology. RNA sequencing and gene ontology
(GO) enrichment were performed in 10 cases with high cardiac virus load and 10 age‐matched cases
without cardiac infection.
Results A relevant SARS‐CoV‐2 virus load was detected in 41 out of 95 deceased (43%). The median
cardiac virus load was 7952 copies per µg RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In situ hybridization revealed SARS‐
CoV‐2 RNA primarily in the interstitium or interstitial cells. Virus detection was not associated with
increased inflammatory cells. Relevant cardiac infection was associated with increased expression of
the entry factor TMPRSS2. Cardiac virus replication was found in 14/95 hearts (15%). Remarkably,
cardiac virus replication was associated with shorter time between diagnosis and death. RNA
sequencing revealed clear activation of immune response pathways to virus infection and destruction
of cardiomyocytes. Hearts with high virus load showed activation of the GO term “extracellular
exosomes”.
Conclusion SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including virus replication and distinct transcriptomic alterations
without signs of myocarditis demonstrate a cardiac involvement. In this autopsy series, cardiac
replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 was associated with early death.

2 Introduction
Over 1.5 million people died in 2020 due to the global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2.1 Importantly,
effective treatment options remain scarce due to limited knowledge of the exact pathological
pathways involved in the disease. In addition to vaccinations, better therapies for patients with
COVID‐19 are needed. While repurposed antiviral drugs for patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 did
not reduce the overall mortality,2 immunosuppressant therapies such as dexamethasone and IgG
infusions appear to improve outcomes in patients with COVID‐19.3, 4 Therefore, understanding the
immune response in organs that are key to survival may be essential for developing much needed
treatment strategies.
While the virus is primarily targeting the respiratory system during the course of the disease other
organs are infected as well.5 This results in thrombotic complications and direct injury of the kidneys
and the heart.6 In the heart, inflammation can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging after
COVID‐19.7 Furthermore, cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID‐19 predicts a severe course of the
disease and premature death,8, 9 additionally increased troponin serum levels are associated with
death.9, 10 A previous pilot study from our group found SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA in 16/39 (41%) hearts of
deceased who died with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.11 It remains unclear whether this potentially dangerous
cardiac involvement is the result of direct virus replication in the heart or secondary cardiac injury in
the context of hypoxia, thrombosis, and multi‐organ damage.12
To reveal cardiac infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 and associated pathological consequences, myocardial
tissue was investigated directly in our studies.11 To address (i) the extent of virus infection and
replication within the myocardial tissue, (ii) the virus localization in the heart and (iii) changes of gene
expression associated with cardiac SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we performed a systematic analysis of hearts
obtained at autopsy from deceased who died with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

3.1

Material & Methods
Study cohort and tissue sampling

Consecutively, 95 deceased with proven SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were autopsied at the Institute of Legal
Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg‐Eppendorf in Germany between April and May,
2020. The SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was confirmed prior to death or post mortem by quantitative reverse
transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) from pharyngeal swabs.13 Two tissue specimens
from the free left ventricular wall were collected during autopsy and either snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen or fixed in 10% neutral‐buffered formalin for subsequent analyses.
This study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians
(PV7311). A brief report investigating the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of the myocardial tissue for the first 39
cases already described a virus load of more than 1000 copies per µg RNA in 41% of the cases.11 This
study was now extended to 95 cases and additional investigations. Furthermore, cases 1 to 39 were
part of an autopsy study of first COVID‐19 deaths in Hamburg, Germany, reporting causes of death and
accompanying comorbidities.14

3.2

RNA isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative TaqMan PCR

Total RNA was isolated using QIAzol (Qiagen, Germany) and subsequently purified with the miRNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) as described earlier.11, 15 Reverse transcription of 1 µg RNA was carried out
using the high‐capacity complementary DNA (cDNA) kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in the presence
of random primers. Quantitative TaqMan PCR was performed using gene expression master mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Specific gene expression assays are listed in Supplemental Table S1.
Methods are described more detailed in the Supplemental Material.

3.3

Virus load copy number and replication

To determine the virus load in cardiac tissue, cDNA reversely transcribed with random primers was
used. Quantitative TaqMan PCR was performed with primers and probe for the viral gene E as

previously described.16 Copy number was calculated according to a purified and quantified PCR product
and plotted as heat map.11
To detect virus replication, the intermediate minus RNA strand was transcribed into minus‐strand‐
specific cDNA using the high‐capacity cDNA kit either in the absence or in presence of 1 µM minus
strand‐specific primer. To avoid the detection of non‐specific cDNA synthesis, the minus‐strand specific
primer E‐Sarbeco‐F was tagged by adding 14 nucleotides at the 5’ end (tagged‐E‐Sarbeco‐F,
5’‐TGCGATAATTGATACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT‐3’). This tagged minus‐strand‐specific cDNA
was subsequently quantified by TaqMan PCR as described above using the primer shift‐E‐Sarbeco‐F
(5’‐TGCGATAATTGATACAGGTACGTTAA‐3’) instead of the non‐modified E‐Sarbeco‐F primer. Tagging
the primer for reverse transcription is known to avoid the detection of non‐specific cDNA synthesis.17,
18

All primers and probes were purchased from Tib Molbiol, Germany. Virus replication was scored

according to Ct‐Values (0 – no replication, 1 – low replication, 2 – moderate replication, 3 – high
replication) and plotted as heat map using Morpheus.19

3.4

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence

Four micrometer‐thick formalin‐fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were rehydrated and
used for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Diagnostic immunohistological analyses
were performed in the CAP‐accredited laboratory IKDT (Institute for Cardiac Diagnostic and Therapy,
Germany) as described in the Supplemental Methods and used for the characterization and
quantification of inflammatory infiltrates. Myocardial inflammation was diagnosed by CD3+
T‐lymphocytes/mm², CD68+ macrophages/mm², CD45R0+ memory T‐cells, and CD8+ cytotoxic
T‐cells/mm². Intramyocardial inflammation was assigned according to the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) statement by CD45R0+ cells > 14/mm², CD3+ T‐lymphocytes > 7/mm², and in addition
CD68+ cells > 14/mm2 and CD8+ cells > 1.8/mm2.20 To visualize increased inflammatory infiltrates,
quantified immune cell numbers were plotted as x‐fold to threshold of myocardial inflammation as
heat map using Morpheus.19

Immunofluorescence was carried out according to established protocols and as described in the
Supplemental Methods.15, 21

3.5

In situ hybridization – RNAscope

For detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 plus and minus strand, RNAscope in situ hybridization was performed on
FFPE tissue sections of the left ventricle using RNAscope® 2.5 HD Reagent Kit‐RED (#322350; Advanced
Cell Diagnostics (ACD), USA). For fluorescent staining, RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent v2 reagent kit
(#323100, ACD, USA) was used. Tissue pretreatment, hybridization of target specific probe (listed in
Supplemental Table S3), subsequent amplification steps and signal detection were performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and described in detailed in the Supplemental Methods.

3.6

Massive analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) as 3’mRNA Sequencing

For 3’mRNA sequencing analysis, 10 cases who exhibited a cardiac infection with more than
1000 copies per µg RNA were compared to 10 age‐matched cases without cardiac infection selected
from our study cohort. Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) is a 3’mRNA sequencing method based
on the analysis of Illumina reads derived from fragments that originate from 3’mRNA ends.22 The RNA
samples were processed using the MACE‐Kit v.2 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (GenXPro
GmbH, Germany). Briefly, RNA was fragmented, polyadenylated mRNA was enriched and amplified by
competitive PCR after poly‐A specific reverse transcription and template‐switch based second strand
syntheses. Duplicate reads as determined by the implemented unique molecular identifiers
(TrueQuant IDs) were removed from the raw dataset. Low quality sequence‐bases were removed by
the software cutadapt (https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt/) and poly(A)‐tails were clipped by an
in‐house Python‐Script. The reads were mapped to the human genome (hg38) and transcripts were
quantified by HTSeq.
Differential gene expression was calculated using DESeq223 and plotted using Graph Pad Prism
(GraphPad Software, USA). For the 19 most significant genes (FDR < 0.05), gene expression of all
replicates (cases) was visualized as heat map. Therefore, normalized gene counts for each case were
standardized to mean of the normalized gene counts of the control group (without cardiac infection)

and plotted as log2‐values. For data visualization R statistical software version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) tool ComplexHeatmap was used.24

3.7

Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) annotation data are based on ENSEMBL. GO enrichment analysis was performed
using the topGO package (bioconductor). Enrichment of GO terms was calculated by the Fisher’s Exact
Test based on differentially expressed transcripts (p‐value < 0.05 and 2‐fold up‐ or downregulated).
The results of the GO enrichment analysis were visualized using the R package GOplot 1.0.2.25 The GO
chord graph indicates associations between selected genes to selected GO terms and was generated
utilizing GOChord. The left side of the circle displays selected genes together with their color‐coded
fold change (log2), whereas the right side of the circle shows selected GO terms. Genes and
appertaining GO terms are connected by lines.
The GO circles were generated using GOCircle. The GO circle presents the differential gene expression
for each annotated gene of the selected GO terms. In the outer circle, the fold change (log2) of all
annotated genes within the GO term is displayed as scatter plot. While significantly upregulated genes
are highlighted in red, significantly downregulated genes are highlighted in blue. In the inner circle, the
significance of the GO term (‐log10(p‐value)) is indicated by the height of the bar chart, while its color
displays the z‐score. The z‐score is calculated for each term by taking the number of upregulated genes,
subtracting the number of downregulated genes, and dividing this number by the square root of the
number of annotated genes. Whether the majority of genes in this term is up‐ or downregulated is
displayed by the color gradient from red to blue, respectively.

3.8

Statistical analyses

Case characteristics were reported as medians and interquartile ranges in brackets for continuous
variables. Binary variables are shown as counts with frequencies in brackets. The p‐values were
determined by the comparison to those cases with no cardiac infection. Mann‐Whitney test was used
for continuous variables and chi‐squared test for binary variables.

To assess differences in outcome the primary endpoint of mortality was analyzed. Survival time of
cases was estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. A post‐hoc pairwise comparison was conducted
by the Log‐rank test considering the Hochberg correction for multiple testing. To evaluate the
association between comorbidities and cardiac infection, univariate logistic regression models were
fitted. Forest plots display the respective odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The vertical
line at an OR of one is the line of no effect. A clipped CI is indicated by arrows. A p‐value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with R statistical software version 3.6.0
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

4 Results
4.1

Cardiac infection of SARS‐CoV‐2

We investigated 95 deceased who died with a confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. As shown in Table 1,
the median age was 84 years (IQR 76, 87) and 54% of them were female. The majority of cases died in
hospitals (36% normal care and 26% intensive care) or nursing homes (27%, Supplemental Table S4).
Cardiac tissue was collected during autopsy with a median post mortem interval of 4 days (IQR 3, 7).
Virus load in cardiac tissue specimens was determined from isolated RNA by reverse transcription
followed by quantitative PCR. As shown in Figure 2A, SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA in the heart was detected
in 49 out of 95 cases (52%). In 46 cases, no SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in cardiac tissue.
Since 1000 copies per µg RNA was deemed as clinically significant,11 41 out of 95 cases (43%) who
exceed 1000 copies per µg RNA were included in further analyses. This group revealed a median virus
load of 7952 copies per µg RNA (IQR 2507, 32 005). In 28 out of these 41 cases with cardiac infection,
virus replication was detectable, 14 with weak, 10 with moderate and 4 with strong virus replication.
Additionally, the virus was visualized in tissue sections utilizing in situ hybridization. As shown in
Figure 2C, SARS‐CoV‐2 virus genome (plus strand) was detected frequently, whereas SARS‐CoV‐2
intermediate strand for replication (minus strand) was rarely detectable in the consecutive section. In
this representative case, the virus genome was apparently detectable in non‐cardiomyocyte
structures. To investigate the localization of virus particles, we performed fluorescent co‐staining of
SARS‐CoV‐2 plus stand (red) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, cyan) as marker for cell membranes
and fibrotic tissue (Figure 3). Negative and positive controls for chromogenic and fluorescent in situ
hybridization are shown in the Supplemental Figure S1 and S2, respectively. In the majority of cases,
virus particles are co‐localized with WGA indicating a virus localization in the interstitium or in
interstitial cells. Localization within cardiomyocytes as depicted in Figure 3g is rare.
Next, histological signs of immune cell infiltrates were determined by immunohistochemistry.
Therefore, CD45R0+ memory T‐cells, CD3+ T‐cells, CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ cytotoxic T‐cells were
quantified and plotted for each case individually in Figure 2B. Individuals with elevated numbers of

infiltrated cells were not differentially distributed in cases with or without cardiac infection. In
addition, the number of positive cells were compared between those cases without cardiac infection
and those with cardiac infection higher than 1000 copies per µg RNA or to those with clearly detectable
virus replication (Figure 2D). No significant differences were determined for CD45R0, CD3 and CD68
between both groups, while CD8 was only detectable in very few cases. Representative staining are
shown for three different cases representing increased infiltrated cells of distinct subpopulations in
Figure 2E.

4.2

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of the heart is not associated with comorbidities

According to virus load and virus replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in cardiac tissue, we defined the group
without cardiac infection and the group with cardiac infection higher than 1000 copies which was
further constricted to cases with virus replication scores higher than 1. Two comparisons were
performed: (i) 46 cases without cardiac infection to 41 cases with cardiac infection higher than
1000 copies per µg RNA and (ii) 46 cases without cardiac infection to 14 cases with virus replication
scores higher than 1. As shown in Table 1, both comparisons revealed no significant differences in age,
sex and post mortem intervals indicating matched groups with respect to typical confounders in post
mortem setting. However, time between diagnosis and death, representing the interval between the
first positive respiratory swab for SARS‐CoV‐2 and date of death, was significantly smaller in cases with
virus replication in the heart compared to cases without cardiac infection (p = 0.017). Accordingly, time
between diagnosis and death was analyzed utilizing Kaplan‐Meier Curves shown in Figure 4A and
revealed significant differences as well for comparison of replication positive cases with samples
without cardiac infection (p = 0.012). Virus replication in the heart was associated with a significantly
shorter survival time.
Next, we examined whether cardiac infection or virus replication is associated with expression levels
of entry factors described for SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, gene expression of angiotensin‐converting
enzyme‐2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease‐2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsin‐B (CTSB) and cathepsin‐L
(CTSL) was compared. As depicted in Figure 4B, gene expression of TMPRSS2 was significantly

increased in groups with cardiac infection and replication, whereas gene expression of ACE2, CTSB and
CTSL remained nearly unchanged.
During autopsy, comorbidities of each case were diagnosed. To analyze whether comorbidities
promote cardiac infection, odds ratios for the cardiac comorbidities hypertension (HTN), coronary
artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF) or the sum of cardiac comorbidities revealed no association
(Figure 4C) between comorbidities and cardiac infection or replication. Additionally, other non cardiac
comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
cancer or the sum of non cardiac or all comorbidities are not associated with cardiac infection.

4.3

Identification and gene ontology analyses of top differentially expressed genes using
3’mRNA sequencing

For 3’mRNA sequencing, 10 cases with high virus load in cardiac tissue were selected and compared to
10 age‐matched SARS‐CoV‐2 positive cases without cardiac infection (Supplemental Table S4). As
shown in Figure 5A, 23 335 genes were annotated whereof 824 genes were identified as significantly
different. Out of these 824 genes, 394 genes were significantly upregulated (red) and 430 genes
significantly downregulated (blue) in cardiac tissue with high virus load of SARS‐CoV‐2. Next, we aimed
to compare regulated genes with protein expression. Olink Proteomics disseminate a publicly available
data set analyzing over 1400 plasma proteins in a COVID‐19 cohort including symptomatic controls.26
Out of the 824 differentially expressed genes in our cohort, 73 corresponding plasma proteins were
measured in the Olink data set. Out of these 73 targets, 48 were up‐ and 25 were downregulated on
gene expression level in infected myocardial tissue. Comparing plasma protein levels of refined groups
with and without COVID‐19, overlaps between gene expression and plasma levels were identified. Out
of the 48 myocardial upregulated genes, 16 were confirmed to be elevated on plasma protein level in
COVID‐19 patients. (For more detail see Supplemental Material and Supplemental Figure S3.)
The 824 differentially expressed genes were further restricted by the false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05
resulting in top 19 differentially expressed genes, 11 upregulated and 8 downregulated. The most

significantly upregulated gene is APOD (No. 1) while the most significantly downregulated gene is NPPB
(No. 12). As depicted in the profile plot, both are abundantly expressed in the cardiac tissue, whereas
the upregulated genes BPIFB1 (5), ITPR3 (8), CARD16 (11) and the downregulated genes MRPL32 (19),
MYPN (18), AKAP6 (14) are rarely expressed (Figure 5B). The data and names for all top 19 differentially
expressed genes are plotted for each case separately as heat map in Figure 5C.
Next, GO enrichment analyses were performed to identify significant GO terms in infected
myocardiums. We selected all GO terms which include at least 3 of the top 19 genes. Afterwards, non‐
significant GO terms as well as large GO terms with more than 3000 annotated genes were excluded.
Subsequently, we identified 12 significantly regulated GO terms which are depicted in the GO chord
graph in Figure 5D and listed in 5F. 9 out of these 12 GO terms were linked to the immune system
(5 terms, displayed in purple) or to extracellular regions (4 terms, displayed in green), whereas the
remaining 3 GO terms were displayed in grey. Furthermore, 15 out of the top 19 genes are annotated
in GO terms linked to the immune system.
The detailed results for the 12 GO terms displayed in the GO chord are plotted in Figure 5E and F. The
majority of genes in the GO terms linked to the immune system (1‐5) were upregulated, indicated by
red z‐scores. Remarkably, “defense response to virus” (1) is the most significant GO term in this group
and emphasizes the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of the cardiac tissue. In the extracellular group, the GO terms
extracellular space (6) and extracellular exosome (7) reach the highest significance. In the highly
significantly regulated GO term mitochondrion (10), most genes are downregulated, indicated by a
blue z‐score.

4.4

Untargeted and targeted selection of GO terms

GO term analyses of the 3’mRNA sequencing data revealed 940 significantly regulated GO terms within
all three GO categories, 98 in molecular function (MF), 159 in cellular component (CC) and 683 in
biological process (BP). To narrow these GO term analyses we performed an untargeted and a targeted
selection.

First, for each of the three categories BP, CC and MF ancestor charts of the 15 most significant GO
terms were created. Since the significance of parental and child terms is often based on the same set
of genes, we selected most descendent child terms with at least 40 annotated genes for each category.
Overall, 11 child terms were obtained and displayed in Figure 6A. The GO terms were linked to general
topics such as (i) response to virus, (ii) cardiomyocyte structure, and (iii) respiratory chain. GO terms
(1‐3) linked to (i) response to virus almost exclusively include significant upregulated genes which is
further emphasized by the red z‐scores. In contrast, GO terms (9‐11) linked to (ii) cardiomyocyte
structure and GO terms (6‐8) linked to (iii) respiratory chain contain primarily significant
downregulated genes which implies the loss of cardiomyocyte structure and mitochondrial function in
cardiac tissue infected with SARS‐CoV‐2.
Second, the list of all 940 significant GO terms was searched for specific keywords. According to the
current literature with respect to SARS‐CoV‐2, we chose keywords linked to four general topics: (i)
virus, viral, (ii) lipoprotein, (iii) coagulation, platelet, complement, and (iv) MHC. The resulted GO terms
with at least 10 annotated genes were depicted in Figure 6E‐G.
As shown in Figure 6E, the search using the keywords “virus” and “viral” revealed 13 significant GO
terms, which are linked to the general topic response to virus. As depicted in the outer circle, these
GO terms include more genes significantly upregulated in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cardiac tissue (red) than
significantly downregulated genes (blue) compared to non‐infected cardiac tissue. The ubiquitous
upregulation of these GO terms is also demonstrated by red z‐scores in the inner circle.
In Figure 6F, the keyword “lipoprotein” revealed seven significant GO terms, including four gene sets
comprised of two identical sets. Therefore, five significant GO terms were displayed including the more
specified GO terms for high‐density (5) and very low density (9) lipoprotein particles. The keyword
“platelet” revealed three significant GO terms (1‐3), the keyword “complement” one significant GO
term (4) and the keyword “coagulation” revealed no significant GO terms.

5 Discussion
Reporting on the largest available autopsy series so far, this analysis confirms that cardiac tissue can
be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 with virus replication being present in COVID‐19 autopsy cases.11 Beyond
this, the key findings of the study are: (i) virus replication in the myocardium is associated with
accelerated death; (ii) expression of the virus entry factor transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2) was increased in cases with cardiac SARS‐CoV‐2 infection while the ACE2 receptor was not
differently regulated and (iii) bulk mRNA sequencing revealed 824 differentially expressed genes in
cases with cardiac infection followed by GO enrichment analyses allowing functional interpretations.

5.1

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of the heart – susceptibility and consequences

This cohort study was performed in the metropolitan area of Hamburg, Germany. 85% of the deceased
were aged 70 years or older, which is consistent with COVID‐19 deaths in Germany.27 Virus infection
of non‐respiratory tract organs was documented in COVID‐19 autopsy studies earlier.5, 8, 28 However,
we recently showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detected in the heart of about 50% of fatal COVID‐19
cases.11 By analyzing more cases, we confirmed that the heart is targeted by SARS‐CoV‐2
in approximately 40‐50% of the COVID‐19 autopsy cases.
Next, we investigated the localization of virus particles within distinct cell types in the heart. In some
studies, electron microcopy was utilized to confirm virus localization in the myocardial tissue.29, 30
However, the identification of virus particles by electron microscopy is unspecific and remains
challenging, particularly in tissue sections.31,

32

Therefore, we combined two sequence‐specific

methods to confirm virus in the myocardium: (i) sequence‐specific RT‐PCR to determine virus presence
and (ii) sequence‐specific in situ hybridization for visualization and localization. Furthermore,
fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed viral RNA in the interstitium or interstitial cells, whereas viral
RNA in cardiomyocytes was rarely detectable but not absent. This created evidence that non‐myocytes
but also myocytes are targeted by the virus, coherent to other virus infections that do not target
primarily myocytes and still cause myocardial dysfunction.33, 34

It is unclear which factors determine the susceptibility of the myocardium to be infected with SARS‐
CoV‐2. Therefore, gene expression of ACE2, known as receptor of the Spike protein, and the host
proteases TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL was investigated.35‐37 Interestingly, the infection of myocardial
cells was associated with increased gene expression of the transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2) in those cases with SARS‐CoV‐2 genome in the cardiac tissue and amplified in those with
signs of virus replication. TMPRSS2 is facilitating virus entry into the host cell as well as being essential
for virus spread and pathogenicity.38 This is the first report of TMPRSS2 being differently regulated
within cardiac tissue and therefore potentially mediating virus infection of cardiac tissue. Together,
this might fuel therapeutic application of TRMPSS2 inhibitors for COVID‐19, as are being tested in
patients in clinical trials (NCT04321096 and NCT04338906). Obviously, further studies need to verify
this finding, but intriguingly, TMPRSS2 knock‐out reduced the inflammatory response after
experimental SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and this was in part dependent on TLR3 signaling.39 This is coherent
to our data showing less inflammatory dysregulation (gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines)
in those without SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the heart. Contrarily, ACE2, as the main receptor for virus
uptake, as well as was the proteases cathepsin L and B (CTSL/CTSB), known to be involved in viral
membrane fusion35 and priming the Spike protein of the virus, were not dysregulated in those groups,
suggesting that susceptibility to the virus might not be correlated to changes in gene expression of
those targets.
Additionally, relevant virus replication in the myocardium was detected in 15% of deceased. Neither
virus infection nor virus replication in the heart was associated with increased numbers of
inflammatory cells. This was coherent for different inflammatory cell markers including different T‐cell
subtypes as well as macrophages. Case reports with positive cardiac SARS‐CoV‐2 infection together
with histological signs of myocarditis are rare,40, 41 whereas myocardial inflammation of patients
recovered from COVID‐19 but without confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the heart was reported.7
Therefore, myocarditis might be developed as sequela due to active or prior COVID‐19 disease which

does not necessarily include cardiac infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. Whether myocardial virus activity in
the absence of clinical evident myocarditis might result in long‐term consequence is unknown.
In our study, 93% of cases suffered from two or more comorbidities which is coherent with other
autopsy studies beyond Hamburg.28, 42‐44 Interestingly, neither cardiac nor other comorbidities were
associated with cardiac infection and even signs of virus replication in the myocardium were not more
frequent in those with comorbidities. This is different in other organs, like the kidney, where cases with
organ manifestation in general were more likely to have more comorbidities.5, 8 Age might also be a
predictor to fuel organotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2, but all cases included here were of high age making
this difficult to assess. In general, autopsy studies need to be interpreted with caution in view of these
associations, since survivors of the disease are excluded, which makes this subgroup of COVID‐19
patients unique. Despite that fact, virus replication in the heart is associated with more rapid death
compared to those deceased without cardiac virus infection in our study cohort, suggesting that active
cardiac infection could be a contributor to death. This is a clinically important and novel finding.
Similarly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of kidney resulted in premature death as well.5

5.2

RNA sequencing and functional GO enrichment analyses

To address virus associated alterations in gene expression, we measured these changes utilizing bulk
mRNA sequencing. Therefore, 10 cases with and 10 cases without cardiac SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were
analyzed to detect differentially expressed genes. Thus, 824 significantly regulated genes (p < 0.05)
were identified suggesting these might be specific for cardiac SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Out of the
identified 824 genes, 73 proteins were measured in plasma of a COVID‐19 cohort by Olink
proteomics.26 The SARS‐CoV‐2 associated regulation on gene expression level within the myocardium
was confirmed for 17 plasma proteins (16 upregulated, 1 downregulated) in severely diseased patients
with and without COVID‐19.
Applying a FDR < 0.05, the number of 824 differentially expressed genes were subsequently narrowed
down to the top 19 genes. Interestingly, those contained two upregulated apolipoproteins (APOE and
APOD) and two upregulated interferon related proteins (IFI44L and IFIT3) as well as upregulated

TRIM25 known as interferon expression inducing factor. Wang et al. previously showed that ACE2 as
virus receptor was translocated into lipid rafts as viral entry site. This translocation can be induced by
APOE‐mediated cholesterol influx. Using a SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus entry assay, they documented a 3‐
fold higher virus infection in cells treated with APOE.45 Upregulated APOD expression was shown
during acute encephalitis induced by the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoVC‐OC43) in mice, while
overexpressing ApoD in transgenic mice resulted in improved survival.46
Interferons are central to antiviral immunity, but impaired interferon activity was described in severe
COVID‐19 patients.47 In line with this finding, our second top gene IFI44L was described as negative
feedback regulator of host antiviral response. IFI44L silenced cells revealed reduced virus titer indicting
that IFI44L supports virus replication.48
To go beyond single genes, GO enrichment analyses were performed resulting in 940 significant GO
terms all together. To identify relevant GO terms, we utilized 3 different approaches to narrow down
this large number of GO terms. First, GO terms including at least three of the top 19 differentially
expressed genes were determined and plotted as GO chord graph. Second, most significant child terms
were determined according to ancestor chars to avoid lists of child and parent terms. Third, besides
those untargeted selection, keywords were used to filter significant GO terms according to virus
associated host response, such as MHC molecules, or clinically known features, like dyslipidemia or
thrombosis.49, 50
The SARS‐CoV‐2 infection elicits typical transcriptional response in the cardiac tissue. This includes for
instance the GO terms “defense response to virus”, “innate immune response” and “type I interferon
signaling pathway”. Interestingly, the GO term “defense response to virus” was identified by both
untargeted approaches strengthening the specificity of this term. Similarly, the GO term “extracellular
exosomes” were also identified by both untargeted selection criteria. This unexpected GO term
represents the most significant GO term comparing all descendent child terms. This is in line with the
finding that the virus life cycle shares common routes with the biogenesis and release of extracellular
vesicles. Additionally, extracellular vesicles are involved in immune response against viral pathogens

by incorporating and spread both viral and host factors. There is evidence that viruses hijack the
secretory pathway for extracellular vesicles to exit infected cells.51 Interestingly, during virus infection,
these extracellular vesicles may become a delivery vector of viral material. This is generally thought to
be a pro‐viral effect and might enable spreading the virus also within the heart.
Furthermore, in SARS‐CoV‐2 positive cardiac tissue decreased gene expression (indicated by blue z‐
scores) were found in GO terms annotated for cardiomyocyte structural proteins. This is in line with
the transcriptomic finding previously reported for SARS‐CoV‐2 infected human iPSC‐derived
cardiomyocytes indicting cytopathic effects on cardiomyocytes.52
Utilizing the third approach to select relevant GO terms by specific keywords, all significant GO terms
related to virus are upregulated in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cardiac tissue indicated by red z‐scores. This
documents the response of myocardial cells to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Next, the keyword “MHC”
revealed significant GO terms annotating MHC complexes in general and more specified MHC‐I class,
which are important for presenting viral proteins of infected cells. The recognition of viral peptides
complexed with MHC‐I molecules is one key event to eliminate virus‐infected cells.53
Vascular thromboembolisms is frequent in COVID‐19 patients treated in an intensive care setting.49, 54
Therefore, we extended the keyword‐based selection to known clinical features such as thrombosis
and dyslipidemia. Therefore, the keywords “platelet”, “complement” and “coagulation” as well as
“lipoproteins” were applied to identify significant GO terms. While the keyword coagulation did not
reveal significant GO terms, platelet and complement resulted in upregulated GO terms as indicated
by red z‐scores.
Besides the fact that two apolipoproteins were already identified within the top 19 differentially
expressed genes, the keyword lipoprotein revealed significant GO terms upregulated in SARS‐CoV‐2
infected cardiac tissue. Several studies proposed an association between dyslipidemia and the severity
of COVID‐19,55 which is further strengthened by our transcriptomic findings.

6 Limitation
This study has some limitations, including the design as an autopsy study. Elderly age and frequently
observed comorbidities of deceased might have influenced the result of cardiac infections and
replication. Presumably, in non‐autopsy studies, the incidence of virus infection will be lower.
Unfortunately, endomyocardial biopsies of patients with COVID‐19 are rare and especially no clinical
routine so far. As an autopsy study, we have only limited clinical information and no information is
present about myocardial biomarkers, which might be upregulated due to the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or
to systemic inflammation due to COVID‐19. Unfortunately, post mortem biochemistry of cardiac
biomarkers in cadaveric serum is not useful even within the first 48 h after death.56 The presented
transcriptomic data provide a snapshot at the time of autopsy, whether differentially expressed genes
are the cause or a consequence of cardiac infection needs to be investigated in the future. Since all
cases were tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we cannot identify factors mediating an impaired
cardiac function due to systemic inflammation caused by COVID‐19.

7 Conclusion
Taken together, SARS‐CoV‐2 seems to alter transcriptomic pathways after infecting the heart but not
causes myocarditis in deceased died with COVID‐19. Nevertheless, this was associated with
accelerated death of cases with vs. without cardiac replication. Elucidating the immune mechanisms
of cardiac involvement as well as other factors contributing to disease severity will provide further
insights into early and late subsequent virus‐associated myocardial damage. Moreover, increasing
pathophysiological understanding might allow for precise and targeted interventions.

Figure 1 – Central Figure: Study cohort and study design.
Two cardiac tissue specimens per case underwent molecular and histological analyses. Virus load and its
replication was determined from isolated RNA. Based on the presence of viral RNA and virus replication in the
myocardium, cases were grouped and compared. While comorbidities were not associated with virus presence
or replication in the heart, more rapid death appeared in those cases with virus replication in the heart. On
formalin‐fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue slices, SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was visualized primarily in the
interstitium or interstitial cells. This was not associated with an influx of inflammatory cells. For 3’mRNA
sequencing, 10 cases with high virus load in cardiac tissue were compared to 10 age‐matched cases without
cardiac infection. Transcriptional profiling allowing for gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed clear
immune response to virus infection in the myocardium.

Figure 2. Presence and replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in cardiac tissue is not associated with elevated number of
inflammatory cells in deceased died with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.
A: Presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was examined in the cardiac tissue of 95 SARS‐CoV‐2 positive deceased. Autopsy
cases are sorted by determined cardiac virus load (shown in red). Virus replication is shown in grey. For
consecutive case‐numbers, age and sex are presented in brackets. Virus load in 1 µg RNA was quantified by
reverse transcription followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A copy number of more than
1000 copies per µg RNA was deemed as clinically relevant and detected in 41 cases, which were further examined
for virus replication. Virus replication was determined using a tagged minus‐strand specific primer for reverse
transcription followed by quantitative PCR of the tagged cDNA. Replication was scored according to the Ct‐values
(0‐no replication / 1‐weak / 2‐moderate / 3‐strong). Note: cases further analyzed using 3’mRNA‐sequencing are
highlighted in bold.
B: Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on formalin‐ fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens
of the myocardium. For each case individually, cells positive for the respective immune cell marker were
quantified and plotted as x‐fold to threshold numbers described for diagnosing myocarditis (Dallas criteria). Red
indicates increased immune cell number.
C: In situ hybridization was used to visualize SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA on FFPE tissue specimens. Hybridizing probes are
specific either for the plus strand representing the virus genome or the minus strand representing the
intermediate strand for replication. Representative images of case ‐ 08 are displayed.
D: The number of positively stained immune cells per mm² is displayed. Cases without cardiac infections are
depicted in light grey, whereas cases with cardiac infections higher than 1000 copies per µg RNA are depicted in
red. Cases with cardiac infection were constricted to those with virus replication scores higher than 1 and are
depicted in dark grey. Both groups with cardiac infections were separately compared to the group without
cardiac infection. Data are depicted as Tukey‐style box plots with median and interquartile range without
outliers.
E: Representative staining of immune cells in cardiac tissue are depicted. On the upper panel, the CD45R0 staining
for case ‐ 65, quantified as 15.14 cells per mm², is shown. The middle panel depicts the CD3 staining for case ‐ 21
(7.37 cells / mm²). For case ‐ 47, the CD68 staining is shown on the lower panel (14.72 cells / mm²).
Magnifications are displayed for each case on the right side.

Figure 3: In situ hybridization of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in cardiac tissue revealed localization in the interstitium or
interstitial cells.
Two representative fluorescence staining on formalin‐fixed paraffin embedded cardiac tissue from four different
cases are shown. All four cases exhibited a virus load higher than 1000 copies per µg RNA. Red signal indicates
SARS‐CoV‐2 plus strand, cell nuclei are stained in blue. White boxes indicate zoomed in areas displayed on the
right. The zoomed in image additionally displays co‐staining with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, cyan), which
stains the interstitium or interstitial cells and surrounds the large cardiomyocytes (CM). In case ‐ 09, ‐ 56 and ‐ 78
the virus particles are co‐localized with WGA close to cardiomyocytes, which represent the finding in the majority
of cases. Localization of virus particles within cardiomyocytes as observed in case ‐ 91 is rare.

Figure 4: Cardiac infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 is associated with accelerated death but not with comorbidities.
Cases without cardiac infection are depicted in light grey, whereas cases with cardiac infection higher than
1000 copies per µg RNA are depicted in red. Cases with cardiac infection were constricted to those with virus
replication scores higher than 1 and are depicted in dark grey. Both groups with cardiac infection were separately
compared to the group without cardiac infection.
A: Kaplan‐Meier curves show time between diagnosis and death for cases grouped by cardiac infection and virus
replication. Time between diagnosis and death is given by the interval between the first positive respiratory swab
for SARS‐CoV‐2 and date of death. The compared groups were defined using information that was unknown
before death. Both groups with cardiac infection were compared to the group without cardiac infection utilizing
log‐rank test. To compare multiple survival curves, p‐values were adjusted by the Hochberg correction.
B: Expression of four SARS‐CoV‐2 entry genes was determined using TaqMan analysis. Gene expression is plotted
normalized to the median expression of the group with no cardiac infection. Data are depicted as Tukey‐style

Figure 5: Identification and gene ontology analyses of the top 19 differentially expressed genes.
Gene expression measured by 3’mRNA sequencing of 10 cases with cardiac SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was compared
to 10 cases without cardiac infection. Downregulated genes in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cardiac tissue are depicted
in blue, while red highlights upregulated genes.
A: Fold change and p‐value are displayed in the volcano plot to visualize significant differences in gene
expression. Further restricted by a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, 19 top differentially expressed genes were
identified (11 upregulated and 8 downregulated genes). Gene symbols and full names are displayed in C
according to here depicted numbers.
B: In the profile plot, fold change and average of normalized counts per 1 million reads are displayed. Red and
blue colors highlight significantly regulated genes with p‐value < 0.05 (small dots) or FDR < 0.05 (large dots). Gene
symbols and full names are displayed in C according to here depicted numbers.
C: The top 19 differentially expressed genes are displayed for each case separately. Gene symbols and full names
are given. Gene expression is normalized to the mean of the group without cardiac infection and plotted as fold
change (log2).
D: In the gene ontology (GO) chord graph, the left side of the circle displays the top 19 genes together with their
color‐coded fold change. The right side of the circle shows the GO terms, to which the genes are annotated. Only
significant GO terms including at least 3 of the top 19 genes are presented, large GO terms including more than
3000 annotated gens are not displayed. Genes and appertaining GO terms are connected by lines. Color codes
for a specific GO term and its function.
E: The GO circle presents the differential gene expression for each annotated gene of the GO terms identified by
the GO chord in panel D. In the outer circle, the fold change of all annotated genes within the GO term is
displayed. While significantly upregulated genes are highlighted in red, significantly downregulated genes are
highlighted in blue. In the inner circle, the significance (‐log10(p‐value)) is indicated by the height of the bar chart,
while its color displays the z‐score. Whether the majority of genes in this term is up‐ or downregulated is
displayed by the color gradient from red to blue, respectively. All significantly regulated genes are listed in the
Supplemental Table S5.
F: The list presents details about the GO terms shown in D&E. The color code in the first column indicates the GO
term in panel D, while the number in the second column indicates the GO term in panel E.

term is up‐ or downregulated is displayed by the color gradient from red to blue, respectively. All significantly
regulated genes are listed in the Supplemental Table S6.
B: The list presents details about the GO terms shown in panel A. Color‐codes in the first column indicate the
general topic to which the term is linked, while the number in the second column indicates the numbered GO
term in panel A.
C: Two representative ‐actinin staining (green) of cardiac tissue section from case ‐ 05 and case ‐ 70 (both
exhibiting high virus load of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the heart) are shown. The normal sarcomeric structure of
cardiomyocytes is indicated by arrows, whereas inconsistent actinin staining as a sign of sarcomeric disarray is
indicated by asterisks. Nuclei counterstained with DAPI are shown in blue, extracellular matrix stained with WGA
are shown in white.
D: Two representative images of cardiac tissue from case ‐ 45 who exhibited high virus load in the heart. White
boxes indicted zoomed in areas of the image on the right. Some cardiomyocytes lack DAPI staining for the nuclei.
White arrows denote the putative region of nuclear localization.
E‐G: According to the current literature, the list of 940 significant GO terms was searched for specific keywords.
E: 13 GO terms were identified within the 940 significant GO terms searched for keywords “virus” and “viral”.
Detailed results and significantly regulated genes are listed in the Supplemental Table S7. Red z‐scores indicate
upregulated gene expression in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cardiac tissue.
F: 4 significant GO terms (1‐4) were identified for keywords “platelet” and “complement”, whereas search for
the keyword “coagulation” revealed no significant GO term. 7 GO terms were found by the keyword
“lipoprotein”. GO terms with identical gene sets were not displayed. Detailed results and significantly regulated
genes are listed in the Supplemental Table S8. Red z‐scores indicate upregulated gene expression in SARS‐CoV‐2
infected cardiac tissue.
G: 6 significant GO terms were identified for the keyword “MHC”. GO terms for MHC in general (1, 2) or more
specified to MHC‐I (3‐6) were significantly regulated. MHC‐II related GO terms were not significant. Detailed
results and significantly regulated genes are listed in the Supplemental Table S9. Red z‐scores indicate
upregulated gene expression in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected cardiac tissue.
