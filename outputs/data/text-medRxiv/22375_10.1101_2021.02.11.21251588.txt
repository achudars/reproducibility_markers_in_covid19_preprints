Abstract—The present work studies the reactions of citizens
from United States of America (USA) during the first cases of
Bubonic Plague in the territory on August 2020, during pandemic
generated by Covid-19. The interest of the study is analyze the
posts of users from all the states of USA following a Text Mining
approach. The collection of data is performed through Twitter
Application Program Interface (API) of Twitter, considering
keywords: bubonic plague and black death. The results show the
states with highest number of coronavirus has more publication
than others and the interest about treatments, political issues and
public health.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In August 2020, a news story is published that a resident of
California, in the United States, tested positive for black death,
being the first human case of the disease in this American state
in five years [1]. Along with this, in December 2019, a new
coronavirus triggered a group of cases of severe pneumonia
in Wuhan, China. Since then, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has called the disease ”coronavirus disease 2019”
(COVID-19) and the etiological agent ”severe acute respiratory
syndrome-coronavirus-2” (SARS-CoV-2) [2].
Bubonic plague ranks as the most severe bacterial disease
known to man as judged by historical records of mortality
and current understanding of the pathological processes that
promote the infection [3].
Both diseases are generated by zoonotic agents, so that the
population begins to relate both diseases. This case raises a
question of how quickly social networks can identify potential
outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, especially when comparing
with the emergence of COVID-19. The plague identified in
USA is a deadly infectious zoonotic disease and is caused
by Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative, immobile cocobacillus,
which mainly affects wild rodents, which are its natural
reservoirs and can be transmitted to humans and other animals
through the bite of fleas from infected rodents. Therefore, it
is also known as vector-borne disease [4].
Another important point is to determine the rapid onset
of potential risks to public health, such as infections by
pathogenic micro-organisms and, because plague in humans
is also transmitted by chance contact with infected animal

tissue or by the entry of aerosol bacteria by inhalation [5], it
is interesting to see how information is disseminated through
social networks and to show that this determination can be
a useful tool for the immediate detection of risks to public
health.
In order to help public health and to make better decisions
regarding Public Health and to help with their monitoring,
Twitter has demonstrated to be an important information
source related to health on the Internet [6], due to the volume
of information shared by citizens and official sources. Twitter
provides researchers an information source on public health,
in real time and globally. Thus, it could be very important for
public health research
In this new world scenario, as established by Espina [7],
it is necessary to find the determinants of disease outbreaks
before they occur, to reduce their impact on populations, and
one of the great advantages is to obtain information brought
by automated systems.
Therefore, concepts, such as generating a relationship between consumer health informatics and public health informatics, must be taken into account. Currently, info-metrics and
web analysis tools are being used for this type of purpose,
obtaining information in an electronic means, specifically the
Internet, with the ultimate goal of having a positive impact on
public health and public policies [8]
II. DATA AND M ETHODS
The present work performs experiments with source data
from Twitter with Natural Language Processing and Data
Mining (Text Mining).
• Choose terms to search on Twitter
• Setup parameters of the query for Twitter and collect data
• Pre-processing data to eliminate words with no relevance
(stopwords)
• Visualization
A. Gather Relevant Terms
After an exploratory of trends and keywords related to
Bubonic Plague, the next terms are chosen:
• ’bubonic plague’,’black death’
,’#bubonicplague’,’#blackdeath’

B. Setup Parameters for the Query and Collect Data
The extraction of tweets is through Twitter API, with the
next parameters:
• date: 14-08-2020 to 21-08-2020
• terms: the chosen words mentioned in previous subsection
• geolocalization, radius: values for each state, see Table.

cases of COVID 19. According to Google statistics [9], the
cities that present the greatest number of cases are those that
talk the most about this issue. This indicates that there is a
convergence of interests on the conjuncture, official news and
users of social networks. Another important point for users
from the cities most affected by COVID 19 to comment more
on this news about Black Death, is that, in each of these states,
there has been more information about this type of zoonotic
diseases outbreak, which can lead to increased anxiety and
stress caused by the pandemic, as well as by the efforts to
reduce its spread [10].

III. R ESULTS

Due to the spread of the disease in the world, social media
platforms and news websites have become places where there
is an intense and continuous exchange of information between
government agencies, professionals and general public.
A. Frequency of tweets per state
For the respective analysis, a review of the most relevant
news regarding this outbreak of black death was made. Due
to the pandemic stage that we live based on COVID-19, it
had to be differentiated from tweets on black death, so it
had to be filtered by keywords. In figure 2, we look at the
number of tweets per state. While California is where the
Black Death case occurred, it is New York where this is most
often discussed, followed by Texas and Washington.
It is noted that the interest of the population, based on the
number of tweets, is in the cities with the highest level of

Twitter is a two-way communication platform with a social
network nature that limits its messages to 280 characters and,
although it seems very limited. it is widely used for more
formal topics than other social networks. In addition, it allows
to generate trends based on the use of hashtags (#) which
makes visible important issues that involve public health. A
word cloud was generated, which is shown in Figure 3, which
gives us a visualization of the 50 most frequently used words
in the study time range. We observe that the topic of the origin
of the Black Death is the greatest interest of people in all USA.
In order to have more detail, the same procedure was
performed for all states of the USA, which is shown in figure
4, where we observe that the word ”Black Death” is present
in most of them. These words related to death are linked to a
fear generated at this stage by the COVID-19 pandemic, so it
is a wake-up call to examine the psychological consequences
of stressors arising from problems related to the emergence of
new diseases [11].
Also, in the analysis of words, we can see that users
talk about medical treatment, control procedures and political
issues related to the health sector.
The heat map is a very useful visual form to know the
variables and their relationships, so it is used in Fig. 5 as a
matrix of the feeling of users through their tweets 24 hours a
day. The values are averages and show there are states with
greater permanence of the idea of the Black Death as a reality
in their country, such as the case of California, Florida, Texas,
and New York having the highest 24-hour rate.
It is also evident that the hours to create tweets, at the level
of all states, is from 16 hours to 03 hours, being the period
of greatest activity in this social network.
However, because the Internet is an interactive medium,
there is also the potential to seamlessly collect even richer data
from people, or to direct them to interventions, this represents
nothing less than a paradigm shift, as traditional surveillance
efforts, which are based, for example, on monitoring emergency room admissions or over-the-counter drug sales, happen
without consumers even noticing it or being able to provide
input. In contrast, using infoveillance methods, consumers can
be directed to provide additional information [12].
In stages like these ones, where epidemiological surveillance is looking for new, timely and real-time detection
alternatives, it is important to evaluate options, such as the use

be undermeasured in data due to unrecognized cases and the
fact that countries do not report them [14]
In this context, the ask of epidemiological surveillance is
motivated by the notion of public health, so the analysis of
alternatives, such as the use of Twitter for the rapid detection
of trends related to this topic is important. In addition, it
can be bidirectional as it could also be used to build public
health campaigns involving specific Twitter users and with the
specific information users require.

of social networks. Besides, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has already stated that ”the cornerstone of public
health security aims to detect high rates of disease and
mortality, the implementation of control measures and the
notification to the WHO of any event that may constitute a
public health emergency or international concern” [13]
Black Death, currently, does not have an effective vaccine
and its mortality rates are 30 % to 50% when left untreated,
while pneumonic plague, when left untreated, is always fatal.
Together with this, the effect of Black Death worldwide may

The use of Twitter has many potentialities and applications
for determining the level of attention to critical situations, such
as the presence of a Black Death case. Besides, it can be
used as a data source in semi-real time and with a significant
sample. This, promoted by the massive use of smart devices,
so along with the development of machine learning tools can
become a useful tool before, during and after events related
to public health.
