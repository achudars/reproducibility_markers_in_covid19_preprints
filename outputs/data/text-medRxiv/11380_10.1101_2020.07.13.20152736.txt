Abstract

13

Masks are an effective tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19, but some people still resist

14

wearing them and mask-wearing behavior has not been experimentally studied in the United

15

States. To understand the demographics of mask wearers and resistors, and the impact of

16

mandates on mask-wearing behavior, we observed shoppers (n = 9935) entering retail stores

17

during periods of June, July, and August 2020. Approximately 41% of the June sample wore a

18

mask. At that time, the odds of an individual wearing a mask increased significantly with age

19

and was also 1.5x greater for females than males. Additionally, the odds of observing a mask on

20

an urban or suburban shopper were ~4x that for rural areas. Mask mandates enacted in late

21

July and August increased mask-wearing compliance to over 90% in all groups, but a small

22

percentage of resistors remained. Thus, gender, age, and location factor into whether shoppers

23

in the United States wear a mask or face covering voluntarily. Additionally, mask mandates are

24

necessary to increase mask wearing among the public to a level required to mitigate the spread

25

of COVID-19.

Introduction

27

Wearing a mask in public is currently a controversial and politicized issue in the United States,

28

even with case evidence from other countries that face coverings help to control the spread of

29

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. As Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and other

30

countries with almost universal masking have been some of the most successful at reducing

31

daily case and death rates [2,3], the United States is trending in the other direction, setting

32

national and state records for daily new cases of COVID-19 at the end of June 2020. Despite

33

the controversy, COVID-19 is a virus that can be transmitted through respiratory droplets from

34

infected individuals and even asymptomatic cases can be contagious [4]. Thus, without a

35

vaccine in distribution, masks are one of the few control measures available for protection

36

against the virus because they serve as a physical barrier between people [5,6]. Not only do

37

masks protect the wearer from aerosolized droplets, but they also provide source control,

38

stopping large droplets coming from a wearer before they become airborne. Study of the

39

filtration efficiency of different fabrics has shown that even cotton weaves and blends can block

40

viral transmission [7], so masks can be made virtually cost-free with household materials.

41

Though the evidence of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of masks is clear, store policies and

42

public mandates requiring masks in America have been met with protests [8] and, in rare cases,

43

violence [9,10]. Public health research shows these measures may already have reduced cases

44

in the United States by 450,000 through May 22nd [11], but the messaging from top-level

45

government officials has been inconsistent [12] and polling suggests that a sizeable portion of

46

the general population are still going out in public without masks [13,14], though self-reported

47

behavior is not always reliable. Women report wearing masks more often than men [14], but

48

demographic differences in mask wearing have not been directly observed. Older adults are at

49

higher risk for more severe cases of COVID-19 [15], so it is reasonable to expect that this

50

demographic may wear masks more than younger individuals. Mask wearing by retail shoppers

51

may also vary by location, in that groups that report greater resistance to mask wearing may be

52

more concentrated outside of urban areas [16]. Specifically, rural areas tend to have higher

53

concentrations of conservative-leaning voters [17] who are reported to be more resistant to

54

wearing a mask [16]. Learning what demographic groups are wearing masks and how mask

55

mandates impact behavior among these groups will help officials to better target public health

56

messaging that promotes the practice among groups with lower usage. To facilitate greater

57

understanding and reliable experimental data on whether gender, age, location, and the

58

presence of mask mandates influence mask wearing in the United States, we conducted a

59

direct observational study at retail stores in Wisconsin. Observations occurred between June

60

and August 2020. From June 9th to August 3rd, 2020, the 7-day average case rate in Wisconsin

61

more than doubled (341 to 844 cases) and the percentage of positive cases had increased from

62

3.5% to 7.4% [18]. Thus, during this period, many major retail chain [19] and Wisconsin state

63

[20] mask mandates were enacted, allowing for study of mask wearing before and after these

64

regulations went into effect.

65

The primary aim of our study was to determine mask use by gender expression, estimated age,

66

and location. We hypothesized that, without a mandate, mask use among females would be

67

greater than males across all age groups and locations. Additionally, that mask use would be

68

greater among older adults (>65 years old) than middle-age (30-65 years old) and young

69

individuals (2-30 years old) and would be less in rural than in urban or suburban areas. A

70

secondary aim of this project was to revisit stores on dates near the implementation of store and

71

state mask mandates to characterize how mask-wearing behavior changes in response to these

72

requirements.

73

Materials and Methods

74

We addressed our primary aim by visiting 36 different retail locations across five different

75

counties in southeastern Wisconsin. Retail stores selected for observation were based largely

76

on geographical spread across Milwaukee and the surrounding areas. In the interest of

77

exploring mask wearing among urban, suburban, and rural stores, we designated a center point

78

of the city (United States Postal Service main office; 345 W St. Paul Ave, Milwaukee, WI, USA)

79

and recorded the linear distance of each store to the city center. Based on distance, stores were

80

then placed into urban (<6.1 km from city center; n = 15, 3.3 ± 1.8 km to city center), suburban

81

(11.5-32.1 km; n = 12, 20.5 ± 7.2 km), and rural (>36.9 km; n = 9, 55.8 ± 21.4 km) store groups.

82

Visits to stores (n = 36) occurred at various times between 9am and 8pm (June 3rd-9th, 2020)

83

and typically lasted less than an hour, with observers recording data with writing utensil and

84

paper or mobile device. To address our secondary aim, stores were revisited and data was

85

collected in the same manner on dates shortly before store or state mandates were

86

implemented (n = 8; July 24th-31st, 2020), when there was a store mandate but not a state

87

mandate (n = 20; July 22nd-July 31st, 2020), and after the Wisconsin state mandate began (n =

88

10; August 1st-3rd, 2020). Note that the overlap in the secondary visit dates is related to

89

corporate differences in the dates mask mandates began at various stores. Stores consisted of

90

grocery and other large big-box retail stores and shoppers were not aware they were being

91

observed. Children under the estimated age of two were not recorded. For all observations that

92

were collected, summary sheets were crosschecked by other observers. All procedures

93

involved public observation or accessed public information and did not require review by an

94

Institutional Review Board.

95

To determine the impact of gender, age, location, and their interactions on mask wearing during

96

the initial visit period (June 3rd-9th, 2020), multiple logistic regression analysis was performed.

mouth) were recorded but excluded from this analysis as they could not be grouped into a

99

dichotomous outcome (mask/no mask). 5517 observations remained for this analysis, and

100

gender expression, age, and location independent variables were dummy coded and entered

101

into a backward elimination procedure with their associated interactions (gender-age, gender-

102

location, age-location, and gender-age-location). Limit for variable removal and test

103

classification cutoff were set at 0.025 and 0.5, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) are

104

expressed with respect to reference groups (gender: male, age: young, location: rural) with 95%

105

confidence intervals and significance was determined at p < 0.05.

106

Percentage data including incorrect mask wearers from the initial visit (June 3rd-9th, 2020) was

107

used to compare to later data (July 24th-Aug 3rd, 2020) and evaluate the changes in mask-

108

wearing behavior in response to mask mandates. All analyses were performed with either

109

Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) or IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences

110

version 26 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

111

Results and Discussion

112

Over the course of 74 visits, 9935 individuals were observed entering retail stores. Of the 5517

113

individuals we observed during the first round of data collection that could be grouped into a

114

dichotomous outcome (mask/no mask) (Fig 1), 41.5% were wearing a mask or face covering

115

with the general trend across gender, age, and location largely aligning with our original

116

hypotheses (Table 1). Females wore masks 7.6% more than males (Fig 2A). Additionally,

117

masks were seen at a higher percentage in older than middle-age (+16.1%) and young

118

(+19.8%) individuals (Fig 2B). Urban and suburban mask wearing was similar but was much

119

lower at rural stores (Suburban: -28.7%; Urban: -26.4%; 55.81 ± 21.37 km) (Fig 2C).

120

Regression analysis revealed that gender, age, and location all significantly impact the odds of

121

an individual being observed to wear a mask (p < 0.001; Fig 3). Results indicate the odds of a

122

female wearing a mask are significantly greater than males (aOR = 1.470, 95% CI = 1.313-

123

1.646). Odds are also greater for middle age (aOR = 1.597, 95% CI = 1.359-1.877) and older

124

adults (aOR = 3.434, 95% CI = 2.811-4.195) than younger individuals. The odds of observing

125

someone in urban (aOR = 3.847, 95% CI = 3.157-4.689) or suburban (aOR = 4.124, 95% CI =

126

3.418-4.975) areas wearing a mask is also much higher than in rural locations, reflecting the

127

much lower prevalence of masks seen at rural stores. The significant age-location interaction

128

effect (p < 0.001) is largely driven by differential changes in mask-wearing behavior between

129

older adults and the other age groups (Fig 2D).

130

Currently, no peer reviewed and direct observational studies of mask wearing are available for

131

comparison to our study findings. Preprint study akin to ours also reflects alarming and similarly

132

low percentages of mask wearing in Wisconsin [21]. Additionally, our data can be discussed in

133

relation to national polls and surveys that addressed mask wearing at about the same time. A

134

May-to-June survey of adults in Wisconsin and four other surrounding states indicated 45.1%

135

always wear a mask when they leave home [13], and data in our study lends credibility to this

136

number. Notably, other regions of the United States surveyed reported different habits (33.5-

137

64% mask usage) so direct observational studies in other parts of the country would be

138

beneficial to confirm national variability when mask mandates are not in place. Another poll

139

conducted in mid-April indicated that only 36% of adults always wear a mask or face covering

140

when outside the home [14], so perhaps usage nation-wide has gradually improved even when

141

masks are not required. Women also reported wearing a mask more often than men. So why

142

are men wearing masks in public places less than women? Perhaps masks are viewed as a

143

sign of fragility or weakness among some men in the USA, as suggested in previous preprint

144

work [22]. Public health messaging that focuses on aligning masks with masculinity would likely

145

be beneficial to improve usage among males in the United States.

146

It is not surprising that our June data showed that older individuals wear masks more than

147

middle-age and young people because older adults are at higher risk for more severe cases of

148

COVID-19. However, the low percentage of young individuals wearing a mask combined with

149

their potential to be asymptomatic [23] creates problems for case containment. A key and

150

underreported benefit of masks is source control, so mask wearing is important across all age

151

groups. Lower-risk individuals put older adults and those with preexisting conditions of all ages

152

at risk of severe illness by not wearing a mask due to the potential for asymptomatic viral

153

transmission.

154

One of the most interesting findings of the current study is the evidence of drastically different

155

mask-wearing behavior in rural areas compared with urban and suburban shoppers when mask

156

requirements are not in place. The odds of urban and suburban shoppers wearing a mask was

157

about 4x greater than for rural store-goers during our June data collection period, possibly

158

reflecting the fact that individuals shopping in rural areas perceive lower risk. However, it has

159

been previously reported that mask-wearing habits do not appreciably differ between counties

160

with low and high numbers of COVID-related deaths [14]. Further, while living population density

161

may be lower in rural regions, the size of retail stores is relatively uniform. Thus, differences in

162

the density of shoppers in stores across regions is likely far less than the actual population

163

density differences reflect. Understanding why rural shoppers may resist the use of masks more

164

than shoppers in other areas is an important issue because the health care system in these

165

areas of the United States may be less equipped to handle large spikes in cases. Rural

166

residents may also need to travel further for emergency care, putting them at greater risk for

167

severe consequences of infection. For these reasons, public health messaging that promotes

168

masks in rural communities is very important.

169

By the last week of July 2020, for stores with no mask mandate, wearing increased to about

170

80% overall (Fig 4). This may reflect some improvement in voluntary compliance, as many

171

stores had announced mandates to be enforced at later dates. Thus, some individuals may

172

have been moved to comply due to the prospect of needing to wear a mask for future shopping

173

trips. Within these data there were no discernable age-related differences, but it was still evident

174

that more females (82.2%) were wearing masks than males (77.8%). Data after store and the

175

Wisconsin state mask mandates began shows mask wearing increased to over 90% overall (Fig

176

4).

177

Modeling studies suggest mask usage needs to be to nearly universal to have a significant

178

effect on the epidemiological curve [24,25], and our results emphasize that mask mandates are

179

necessary to approach this goal. If public officials do not enact these mandates the welfare of

180

shoppers will continue to be left to retail corporations. While retail store mandates obviously

181

improve mask-wearing compliance among shoppers, our data may indicate that that store

182

regulations could be slightly less effective than mandates enacted by government as a slightly

183

higher percentage of individuals were observed correctly wearing masks after a state mandate

184

began (96% vs 93% with store mandate only).

185

Mask mandates obviously improve usage, but it deserves mention that a small percentage of

186

the population still resist masks even with retail store and government regulations in place.

187

Though it may be argued that some shoppers might have a health condition that precludes

188

wearing a mask, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommend against mask

189

wearing if an individual has trouble breathing or is unable to remove a face covering without

190

assistance [26] so it is improbable that this is a valid explanation for all of the mask resistors

191

observed with a state mandate (2%; Fig 4). Mask-wearing mandates are necessary to reduce

192

person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 and save lives as a portion of the general public

193

will resist wearing masks in retail stores without them.

Short Title: Who is wearing a mask?

194

Even with mandates in place, some individuals still resist or wear them incorrectly, putting

195

employees, other shoppers, and themselves at risk due to the potential for viral transmission

196

from asymptomatic carriers [4]. Encouraging voluntary compliance to mask wearing is critical so

197

that retail employees do not have to play the role of “mask police”, risking verbal or physical

198

abuse from resistant shoppers. Close encounters (within six feet) are a great risk to employees

199

if the resistor without a mask is infected. Though some stores provide masks to shoppers after

200

entering, there is still a short period that these individuals are inside of the store without masks

201

on. As the possibility of aerosolized transmission of COVID-19 was recently confirmed [27],

202

every breath and word spoken without a mask on (or without one covering mouth and nose) and

203

especially indoors, increases risk of aerosolized virus spread. Thus, it is critical to wear a mask

204

from entrance to exit of any public indoor space. To further reduce the number of individuals

205

entering without a mask, stores may benefit from providing masks to shoppers that need them

206

outside of the entrance, where possible. Averting cases of COVID-19 will save lives so wearing

207

a mask is a public health service and should not a symbol of frailty or fragility of the individual.

208

Wearing a mask is not about stopping transmission of all cases but minimizing case rates and

209

lessening the public health burden. Importantly, the long-term effects of COVID-19 are still

210

unknown so mask wearing is also vital to reduce burden from future comorbidities that may

211

result within individuals who were infected.

212

Conclusions

213

Masks are an essential public health intervention for combatting the pandemic, and only 41% of

214

individuals observed in our June sample were wearing a mask when entering a retail store. This

215

is less than half the percentage needed to have a significant effect on the reducing the spread

216

of COVID-19 [24,25]. Males, younger individuals, and shoppers in rural communities were

217

observed wearing masks less than other groups. However, with store mandates and a state-

218

wide mandate to wear a mask, we showed that mask-wearing compliance rose to over 90% in

219

all groups, including those that resisted mask wearing in June. As officials around the United

220

States continue to debate mask mandates at local and state levels, our data indicated that

221

mandates are necessary to ensure mask-wearing compliance among the public meets the

222

minimum threshold to take control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data also highlights that a

223

portion of the general population does not follow public health recommendations without them.

224

Furthermore, even with mandates in place a portion of shoppers (~4%) still resist or wear masks

225

ineffectively. Individual shoppers may consider this information to evaluate the potential risks of

226

in-person shopping based on store and local mask policies, location, and the age and gender of

227

the store’s clientele. Our findings are also important to inform policy makers that mask

228

mandates are necessary to improve compliance to a level that can help flatten the

229

epidemiological curve, saving lives and decreasing burden on the United States health care

230

system.

Fig 1. Mask-wearing percentages by Wisconsin county. Data shown indicates the number of
observations collected and percentage of people wearing a mask (vs. no mask) in each county
where retail stores were visited during the initial data collection period from June 3rd through
June 9th, 2020. The star symbol in Milwaukee county represents the city center location used for
identifying urban, suburban, and rural stores.

Fig 2. Mask-wearing percentages across gender, age, and location. Data shown indicates
percentage of individuals wearing a mask (vs. no mask) during the initial data collection period
from June 3rd through June 9th, 2020. A. Females wear masks more than males. B. Older adults
wear masks more than other individuals. C. Mask-wearing habits are similar in urban and
suburban areas, but usage drops off considerably at rural stores. D. Mask wearing plotted by
location highlights how the mask-wearing behavior of older adults (O) is less impacted by
shopping in a rural area than the behavior of young (Y) and middle-age (MA) individuals.

Fig 4. Mask-wearing percentages between June and August 2020. Mask-wearing
compliance was poor in June but had improved immediately before mandates began.
Compliance rose to > 90% with a mandate in place across all demographics, but a small
percentage of the population still resisted. The overlap in “before” and “with store mandates”
dates is related to corporate differences in the dates mask mandates began.
