Abstract.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global threat to healthcare systems,
requiring hospitalization in sub intensive and intensive care for respiratory syndrome in 25-30% of
patients and accounting for a lethality up to 15%.
In this retrospective study the clinical characteristics of 215 COVID-19 patients were correlated
with the peripheral blood immune status.
Different groups of COVID-19 patients may be identified on the basis of clinical behavior and a
strong correlation between groups and age and comorbidities as well as with the immune profile is
demonstrated. A lower age correlates with a lower severity of the disease differentiating between
patients who may be quarantined at home and those requiring hospitalization. An older age (>82
years) together with a higher number of comorbidities is associated to a very severe prognosis.
The absolute number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes was progressively decreasing
according to the severity of the disease and a CD3+ and CD8+ threshold indicating very severe
cases is suggested.

Introduction.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has affected
million people worldwide so far with over 300,000 confirmed death (1). The Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) presents with a highly heterogeneous spectrum of symptoms spanning from
asymptomatic, to mild respiratory ones (fever, cough, shortness of breath), to severe (interstitial
pneumonitis requiring intensive care and external respiratory support) up to death (2). The main
predictive parameters associated with a greater severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and with the
clinical course of symptomatic and hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been identified in older
age and in the presence of comorbidities (mainly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular
diseases, chronic respiratory diseases) (2). Current available information on innate immune status
of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is the increased neutrophils counts, the reduced lymphocytes
counts and the increased serum levels of IL-6 and of C-reactive protein, suggesting a strong
inflammatory response (3). A first report on changes in lymphocyte populations in patients
severely affected by Covid-19 indicate a low T cells count, an increase in naïve helper T cells and a
decrease in memory helper T cells (4). The reduction in absolute count of peripheral T cells has
also been associated to the severity of the disease (5, 6). The aim of the present study was to
analyze the immune profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 at
hospital admission and evaluate the correlation between the immune status and the other clinical
and laboratory parameters.
Materials and Methods.

All patients (n=230) were admitted at emergency department with respiratory symptoms
compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients authorized data disclosure by signing an

informed consent form at admission. All procedures performed in the study were in accordance
with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration.
Throat swab samples were obtained from patients and processed with RT-PCR method by means
of the diagnostic GeneFinder COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit (OSANG Healtcare Co., Ltd, Korea),
following manufacturer instructions, to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis.
The complete blood count with automated differential count was performed using Siemens
Advia2120 hematology analyzer.
The peripheral blood (PB) immunophenotype was performed using a lyse no wash technique with
single platform absolute count (Flow Count beads, Beckman Coulter, Milan, Italy). Briefly, 50 μl of
peripheral blood, collected in EDTA containing tubes, were stained with a mixture of monoclonal
antibodies (CD45 KO, HLA-DR PB, CD8 FITC, CD16+CD56 PE, CD19 PC7, CD4 APC, CD3 APCAF750, all from Beckman Coulter). After 15 minutes of incubation in the dark, at room
temperature (RT) erythrocyte were lysed with 1 ml of ammonium chloride solution for 15 minutes
at RT, then 50 μl of paraformaldehyde solution were added, incubated 5 minutes and, immediately
prior to cytometer analysis, 50 μl of Flow Count beads were added.
Samples were acquired with a 3-lasers 10-colors Navios cytometer and Navios software (Beckman
Couter) collecting at least 500,000 total events or 10,000 beads. Analysis of the lymphocyte
subpopulations was performed using a sequential gate strategy: doublet exclusion, debris/unlysed
erythrocytes exclusion, CD45/SSC lymphocyte identification.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) liquid was filtered on a sterile gauze, the cells counted in Burker
hemocytometer, then centrifuged 10 minutes at 400g, the supernatant was aspired, and the cell
concentration adjusted at 5-10 x 10 cells/ml in phosphate buffered solution (PBS). An amount of

the cell suspension was cytocentrifuged, the slides dried and then stained with Diff-Quick staining
for differential cell count. Hundred μl of the cell suspension were stained with the same mixture of

antibodies used for PB, lysed with 2 ml of ammonium chloride solution, centrifuged 5 minutes at
400g, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 0,5 ml of PBS and immediately acquired to the
cytometer.
The XLstat software was used for the statistical analysis (ANOVA, T test), data modelling and
graphical representation (box and whiskers plots).
Results.

As of April 17 , 2020 a total of 230 patients have been admitted to the emergency department with
th

respiratory symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 203 (88.3%) the diagnosis of
covid-19 was confirmed by use of quantitative RT-PCR of throat swab samples. In 10 (4.3%)
patients the SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed after a second or third throat swab sample. In
two patients (0,9%) with 3 negative throat swab samples, but with clinical and radiological
features compatible with COVID-19, the final diagnosis was obtained by use of QRT-PCR on
bronchoalveolar lavage sample. In other 15 (6.5%) patients the diagnosis of COVID-19 was not
confirmed and other causes of pneumonia were identified.
The data obtained from the retrospective analysis of 215 COVID-19 patients are summarized in
Table 1. The ratio female/male was 1/1.9 and the mean age was 65.6 yrs, the average number of
comorbidities was 1.7, ranging from 0 to 8. The most common comorbidities were diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and neoplasia (data not shown). In all patients
differential count of peripheral blood leucocytes and immunophenotype of peripheral blood
lymphocytes were performed with absolute and relative count of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+,
CD16+CD56+ and CD3+HLADR+ (activated T lymphocytes) cell subsets. The analysis of the
cytograms obtained with the hematology analyzer did not show any significant alteration in

lymphocyte volume or shape compared to normal samples, as already described by Chong et al
(7).
Patients were divided in five groups (Series): the first (S1, n=117, 54.4%) group consisted of
patients with low severity symptoms who, after diagnosis and laboratory screening, were
quarantined at home. The second group (S2, n=51, 23.7%) was represented by patients with mild
symptoms who needed to be hospitalized for supportive care and non-invasive ventilation (sub
intensive care). In the third group (S3, n=24, 11.2%) there were patients undergoing
intensive/invasive treatment (mechanical ventilation using Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure –
BiPAP – or tracheotomy). The fourth group (S4, n = 14, 6.5%) consisted of patients who died early
and whose clinical conditions at hospital admission were critical, without fulfilling criteria for
intensive treatment. The fifth group of patients (S5, n=9, 4.2%) included those who underwent
intensive care and died. The follow up of the 5 groups was restricted to 30 days.
Analysis of variance by ANOVA (Table 2) showed that, overall, the five groups differed
significantly to each other for all parameter investigated, except for the absolute value of
monocytes, the number of activated T lymphocytes (CD3+HLA-DR+) and the CD4/CD8 ratio.
The analysis of the differences between group pairs by T test (Table 3) revealed that age was
significantly lower in the S1 group (60.6 years) than in the other four groups (70.6, 68.4, 82.6 and
69.2 years respectively for S2, S3, S4 and S5). Similarly, the average age in S2, S3 and S5 was
significantly lower than in S4. By contrast, there was no age difference in S2 vs. S3, S2 vs. S5, and
S3 vs. S5.
The average number of comorbidities was significantly different in S1 (1.4) vs. S2 (2.2), S1 vs S4
(2.9), S2 vs S3 (1.4), S3 vs S4 and S4 vs S5 (1.8). Taken together, the most significant difference
between groups was the older age and the higher degree of comorbidities observed in group 4.

The lymphocyte number was significantly lower in the S3 and S5 group compared to both S1 and
S2, while, comparing the very same groups, the granulocyte number was higher. These data
suggest that patients undergoing intensive care (i.e. patients with severe disease) display higher
granulocyte and lower lymphocyte counts than group 1 and 2, (i.e. patients with milder disease
not requiring intensive care). Patients in group 4, having a shorter course of the disease, behave
differently from all other patients, displaying high neutrophil counts and moderate lymphopenia.
The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reflected this pattern for the most, being significantly
different in S3 vs S1 and S2, S4 vs S1 and S2, while the difference of S5 vs S1 and S2, despite of the
very different mean values, did not reach significance, probably because of the small number of
patients in S5 (Table 3). S5 was the group that accounted for the most striking differences in
monocyte counts, being significantly lower when comparing S5 vs S3, S2 and S1. Monocytes were
also reduced in S2 compared to S1.
Mean value, standard deviation and range of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD3+HLADR+, CD19+ and NK
cells for each different group was compared and is illustrated in figure 1. There were no significant
differences between the absolute number of each lymphocyte subset of the S1 group compared to
S2 and S4 (panel A and C). By contrast, almost all lymphocyte subsets were significantly reduced
in S3 and S5 groups compared to the S1 (panel B and D). Similarly, the absolute number of CD3+,
CD4+, CD8+, CD3+HLADR+ and NK cells was reduced in S3 compared to S2 (panel E). Finally, a
significant reduction of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes was observed in S5 compared to S4 (panel
F). Notably, the number of CD8+ cells is 97x10 /L in S5 and 211x10 /L in S4. These data suggest that
6

a low absolute number of CD3+ cells accounts for the lower lymphocyte counts observed in
patients with severe disease compared to patients with milder disease.

In two patients, after three negative results for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by QRT-PCR on
swab throat samples, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with diagnostic purpose was performed and
resulted positive. In both BAL a differential count on cytocentrifuged cells and a flow cytometry
lymphocyte analysis were obtained. In both samples an increased percentage of lymphocytes (63%
and 60% respectively) compared to normal values (10-15%) (8) was observed, with an increased
percentage of CD8 T-cells (Figure 2).
Discussion.

The pivotal role of T cell mediated immunity in viral infection and clearance is well known for
CD4+ helper T cells in assisting and enhancing the function of cytotoxic T cell and B cell, and for
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in contributing directly to virus eradication by means of perforin and
cytokines (9, 10). However, the persistence of viral stimulation may induce a shift in the
differentiation pathway of CD4+ T cells and T cell exhaustion (9). Earlier studies in COVID-19
patients showed a reduction of T cells and an increase of exhausted T cells expressing PD-1
antigen, as well as a direct correlation between T cell reduction and severity of symptoms (11). In
this retrospective analysis of 215 COVID-19 patients we correlate the immune status at
hospitalization with clinical behavior, age and comorbidities, to explore if some immunological
parameter may be predictive of the clinical course. As previously reported (2), also in our series we
observed a low female/male ratio, an average age greater than 65 years and a significant presence
of comorbidities.
The correlation between severity of symptoms, age and number of comorbidities is clear between
the different groups of patients with the exception of that between groups S2 and S3, S2 and S5, S3
and S5 by age and between groups S1 and S3, S1 and S5, S2 and S4 and S5, S3 and S5 for the
number of comorbidities. These data seem to indicate that age is not a discriminating factor among

patients who require hospitalization. Conversely, the number of comorbidities is greater in
patients who die without intensive care (S4) than in patients undergoing intensive care (S3 and S5).
The immune status, in term of absolute number of cells, is more compromised in patients who
need intensive care compared to other patients.
This is true not only comparing patients with low to mild severity symptoms (S1) with patients in
sub intensive (S2) or intensive (S3) therapy, but also comparing sub-intensive (S2) with intensive
care (S3) patients. Finally, despite the small number of patients in each group, a significant
difference between S4 and S5 is present regarding age (lower in S5), comorbidities (lower in S5),
absolute value of CD3+ and CD8+ (extremely reduced in S5). Taken together, these data seem to
indicate that a reduction in lymphocytes number, particularly CD3+ and CD8+, is predictive of a
more severe clinical course. The differences observed in the groups S4 and S5 could suggest that in
the S4 group COVID-19 disease may be a concurrent cause of death (older patients, many
comorbidity) while in group S5 COVID-19 disease, of which deep immune depression represents
one of the hallmarks, can be considered the main cause of death. Similarly, in S2 and S3 the
immune system results even more involved in discriminating patients with different severity of
symptoms, being reduced in S3 also CD4+, NK and activated T cells. The reduction of T cells,
mainly CD8 T lymphocytes, opens several questions on the fate of these cells during SARS-CoV-2
infection. One possible explanation is tissue recruitment and segregation of CD8+ T cells at
infection site (i.e. lung) where they contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On
support of this hypothesis we observed, in two bronchoalveolar lavages of COVID-19 patients, a
predominant lymphocytic infiltration mainly sustained by CD8+ cells (Figure 2).
Further investigations on greater number of patients are needed to define a reliable threshold of
CD3+ and CD8+ T cells below which the probability of a severe disease increases significantly (12).

Nevertheless, we can estimate that in younger patients with no of few comorbidities, the absolute
value of 339x10 /L CD3+ and 97x10 /L CD8+ (both values are the mean value of S5 group) could be
6

scored as negative indicators.
The present study has some limitations. First of all, we only evaluated the main lymphocyte
populations without investigating T cell subsets or cytokine production. Secondly, it is a
retrospective study that does not take into account second or third immunophenotypic analysis of
the same patients and the obvious evolution of the immune profile. Similarly, the follow up of the
patients is limited to a short period of time, and consequently the group to which they are
belonging reflects a “frozen” situation. On the other hand, the purpose of the present study was
not to evaluate the clinical course of the disease but to identify one or more early indicators of the
clinical course, focusing on clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis.
In conclusion, the immune profiling associated to age and comorbidities may help identifying
different groups of COVID-19 patients with different clinical behavior. Further studies are needed
to identify laboratory parameters correlated with the clinical course and to create a scoring system
that will rapidly guide therapy and clinical management.

of

the

distribution

of

peripheral

blood

lymphocyte populations (value in cells/106/L) in the different groups (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5) of COVID-19

patients. The number reported in each box is the mean value of cells for each cell population in each

patient group. A, group S1 vs S2. B, group S1 vs S3. C group S1 vs S4. D, group S1 vs S5. E, group S2

vs S3. F, group S4 vs S5. P value is referred to T test between the two groups. Analysis and graphs

obtained with XLSTAT software.

Figure 2. Flow cytometry of BAL sample. The first plot (FS TOF/FS INT) shows the gate for doublet

exclusion,

the

second

(SS/CD45)

the

lymphocytes

gate,

and

the

third

(SS/CD3)

the

lymphocyte. In the fourth plot (CD4/CD8) the distribution of CD4 and CD8 T cells gated on CD3+

cells is shown.

In the insert, the cell morphology of one representative BAL sample shows the high number of

lymphocytes.
