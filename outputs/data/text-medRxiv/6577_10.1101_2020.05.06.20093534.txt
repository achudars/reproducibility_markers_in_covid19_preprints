Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused
hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g.,
healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries,
limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This
study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare
resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Specifically, the rapid measurement is
achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area
(E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic
information science and systems). The study compared the spatial accessibility measures for
COVID-19 patients to those of general population, identifying which geographic areas need
additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that
may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources caused by COVID-19. The
Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. Our
findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing
healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.

1. Introduction
A novel coronavirus disease (named COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has widely spread worldwide. As of May 6, 2020, about
3.6 million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed worldwide; and in the United States alone,
over 1.2 million people have been sick with more than 73,000 deaths. Among the infected cases,
hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized. The COVID-19 pandemic has exceeded the
capacities of healthcare resources, including healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital
beds, and ventilators (White and Lo, 2020; Xie et al., 2020). This increased demand for
healthcare resources has caused or exacerbated disparities in access to healthcare.
Oftentimes, COVID-19 infection cases and related healthcare resources in demand are
not spatially proportionally distributed. In other words, spatial mismatches need to be resolved
between healthcare resource availability and the needs of COVID-19 patients and general
population. Identifying these mismatches is crucial for allocating healthcare resources efficiently
and effectively (McLafferty, 2015). Therefore, understanding to what extent the healthcare
resources are available in a particular spatial context is urgent.
Measuring spatial accessibility to healthcare resources has long been of interest to public
health research. Examples include healthcare access for seniors (Gu et al., 2009; Paez et al.,
2010), disabled people (Church and Marston, 2003), cancer-specific survivals (Freeman et al.,
2020; Wan et al., 2012), examining spatial accessibility among populations with multiple
transportation modes (Mao and Nekorchuk, 2013; Kaur Khakh et al., 2019), and access to
specific health care treatments such as mammograms (Henry et al., 2013). Spatial accessibility of
healthcare resources can be measured by spatial interactions between the amount of supplies
(e.g., the number of hospital beds or physicians) and demands along with the distance and travel
time between the locations of healthcare resources and those of residential areas.
A commonly used method for measuring spatial accessibility is the two-step floating
catchment area (2SFCA) method (Luo and Wang, 2003). Particularly, the enhanced two-step
floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method accounts for distance decay (Luo and Qi, 2009). The
E2SFCA method uses travel time for a given mode of transportation to derive the areas that are
within 10, 20, and 30 minutes of supply locations. For large study areas such as the state of

Illinois in the USA, calculating catchment areas on a road network has high computational
intensity (Wang and Armstrong, 2009). CyberGIS – defined as geographic information science
and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure – is well suited to resolve this type of
computational intensity through high-performance parallel computing (Kang et al., 2020; Wang,
2010; Wang, 2016).
Motivated to address this computationally intensity challenge, this study aims to rapidly
measure the spatial accessibility of healthcare resources in Illinois. Specifically, the study seeks
to answer the following two research questions: (1) to what extent Illinois residents have access
to healthcare resources during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) which geographic areas have
resource surplus and which areas have resource shortage? To answer these questions, spatial
accessibility was measured based on travel time between the locations of residence and
healthcare resources in the context of COVID-19 patients and general population.
We have developed a parallel enhanced two-step floating catchment area (P-E2SFCA)
method based on CyberGIS-Jupyter – a cyberGIS framework for achieving data-intensive,
reproducible, and scalable geospatial analytics using Jupyter Notebook (Kang et al., 2019; Lyu et
al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2019). In our study, the demand of healthcare resources
comes from either COVID-19 patients or general population. Here, the general population is
considered in the analysis to assess the generalized need for healthcare resources during an
uncontrolled outbreak. We compare spatial accessibility of healthcare between COVID-19
patients and the general population. Our analysis provides insights for decision making to
optimize the allocation of COVID-19 related healthcare resources, such as hospital beds, testing
resources, healthcare personnel, and ventilators. The following section (Section 2) describes the
data and method used in the study. Section 3 summarizes and evaluates the results obtained from
the P-E2SFCA method. Section 4 concludes with a discussion about policy implications and
future directions.
2. Data and Method
2.1. Study Area and Data
This study focuses on spatial accessibility of healthcare resources for the general
population and COVID-19 patients in Illinois, USA. We used four types of datasets, summarized
as follows: 1) hospital dataset, 2) COVID-19 confirmed case dataset, 3) residential dataset, and

4) road network dataset. The hospital dataset was provided by the Homeland Infrastructure
Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) open data forum (https://hifldgeoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/). The HIFLD provides national-level geospatial data that can
be used in supporting community preparedness and research. The COVID-19 confirmed case
dataset at the zip-code level is provided by the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH)
(http://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics). The residential dataset was obtained from the
United States Census Bureau. We used an Application Programming Interface (API) call for
pulling data from the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year detail table for the Zip Code
Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) in the state of Illinois, USA. The road network dataset was retrieved
using a Python package OSMnx (Boeing, 2017), which helped us to download and analyze street
networks from the OpenStreetMap.
In Illinois, there are 183 hospitals from which the information of beds is available in the
dataset. We excluded some hospitals, including military, children, psychiatric, and rehabilitation
in this study, because these types of hospitals may not provide health services to COVID-19
patients. Figure 1(a) illustrates the spatial distribution of hospitals with the population across
Illinois. Figure 1(b) shows the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 confirmed cases in Illinois
as of April 10, 2020. Obviously, the population in Illinois is dense in the Chicago area, and
significant clustering of the COVID-19 cases have occurred in Chicago. As of April 10, 2020,
about 18,000 COVID-19 cases were confirmed out of about 88,000 tests. In Chicago, there are
29 hospitals in which beds are available for the patients and the general population (Figure 2(a)).
As of April 10, 2020, there were about 7,600 confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure 2(b)).
2.2. Parallel Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (P-E2SFCA) Method
The conventional two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is based on a
service-to-population ratio computed in two steps (Luo and Wang, 2003; Guagliardo 2004). The
first step consists of finding all people (i) located within a catchment area of each healthcare (j),
as shown in Figure 3(a). A catchment area is based on a threshold travel time (d0). The second
step computes a service-to-population rate 𝑅" within a catchment area.
𝑅" = ∑

$%

( ∈{,-% .,/ } '(

(1)

where for the number of available resources(s) at each healthcare (j), find all population
locations (k) that fall within a threshold travel distance (d0).

Then, the accessibility 𝐴4 at a residential location i is computed by summing up the service-topopulation ratios, as shown in Figure 3 (b).
𝐴4 = ∑"∈{5-% 65/} 𝑅"

(2)

where i denotes a residential location, and 𝑅" is the proportion of services per person at
healthcare location j whose centroids are located within the catchment area.

Figure 3. Measure of spatial accessibility of a set of hospitals: (a) delineate the catchment area
of each hospital; and (b) sum up the accessibility value at residential locations.

As a relative measurement, the accessibility measurement 𝐴4 indicates which geographic
areas are relatively more accessible than other areas. For example, overlapped areas in Figure
3(b) may have a relatively higher accessibility than other areas. The areas that do not fall within
catchment areas of any hospitals have no access to any hospitals within a predetermined travel
time (e.g., 30 minutes).
To fully take into account the residents who may be more likely to visit closer hospitals
than others, an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method was developed
(Luo and Qi, 2009) to resolve the limitation about no distance decay within a catchment area
(i.e., residents in the same catchment area are assumed to have equal spatial accessibility). The
E2SFCA method accounts for the distance decay, by allowing for multiple travel time zones,

such as 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 minutes. Three values of weights (1, 0.68, and 0.22) were applied
to each travel time zone (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 mins), respectively (Luo and Qi, 2009). Spatial
accessibility is therefore computed as a summation of the measure of accessibility at each travel
interval.
𝐴4 = ∑"∈;5-% ∈<=> 𝑅" 𝑊: + ∑"∈;5-% ∈<A> 𝑅" 𝑊@ + ∑"∈;5-% ∈<C> 𝑅" 𝑊B

(3)

where 𝐴4 denotes the accessibility of people at location i to hospitals, and the proportions of
service-to-population 𝑅" at healthcare locations j whose centroids are located within the
catchment area. 𝑊E denotes the distance weight for rth travel intervals.
Figure 4 (a) shows the workflow of the E2SFCA method using hospital beds as a case of
healthcare resources. The method has two major steps: calculating a bed-to-population ratio for
each supply location and then summing these ratios for residential locations where supply
regions overlap. Since we aim to measure the accessibility for the general population and
COVID-19 patients, we separated the calculation of a bed-to-population ratio from that of a bedto-COVID-19-patients ratio. The first step delineates every hospital’s 30-minute driving zone
through a convex hull. Each zone is segmented into 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 minutes sub driving
zones. These zones are used to compute a hospital bed-to-population ratio using a weighted sum
of residential locations within each hospital’s catchment area following equation (3). Lastly, the
accessibility measurements are aggregated into hexagon grids to minimize orientation bias from
edge effects (Figure 5).

Each hospital’s catchment area and its corresponding driving zones can be expressed on
hexagon grids (Figure 5). If there are overlapping catchment areas, the values at each hexagon
grid are aggregated. Specifically, we used 500-meter hexagon grids for Chicago and 5-km
hexagon grids for Illinois. In Chicago, about 400 meters are the shortest distance between zip
code centroids. Therefore, 500-meter hexagon grids are sufficient to represent the accessibility
measure. Considering the relatively large area of Illinois, 5-km hexagon grids are suitable for
depicting the accessibility measure.

Figure 5. Expression of accessibility measures on hexagon grids. Note: Darker colors represent
areas with higher accessibility. The values of hexagons are determined by Ai from equation (2).
Calculating this measure is computationally intensive because creating driving zones
generally relies on defining a boundary of nodes within a road network that are at the edge of the
driving zones, generating a convex hull around these nodes, and then querying if residences lie
within the boundary. The method also depends on calculating intersections and differences
between multiple hospitals’ driving zones and aggregating the collected statistics appropriately
for each population center.

In order to obtain analytical results rapidly, which is important for the fight against the
COVID-19 crisis, we have developed a parallel computing approach to speeding up the E2SFCA
method. We parallelized the steps of calculating an egocentric graph of the road network within
specified travel times, determining the convex hull of the nodes, and calculating the difference
between convex hulls to derive 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 minutes driving zones. Once these steps
are completed, we also parallelized the portion of the steps that calculate intersections between
the driving zones to aggregate statistics across different hospitals into a holistic measure of
spatial accessibility in hexagon grids. An illustrative example of P-E2SFCA with four processors
is provided in Figure 4 (b).
As a result, accessibility measures are derived. However, the absolute values of the
accessibility measures may not be important to revealing which areas have lower accessibility
than other areas. Instead of using the absolute value, we converted the absolute values of
accessibility measure to the normalized measure as follows:
MNN OP4Q(MNN)

𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝐴𝐶𝐶4 = PRS(MNN)OP4Q(MNN)

(4)

where 𝐴𝑐𝑐4 refers to the accessibility measure at residential location i.
To see which areas have relatively more resources given the COVID-19 confirmed cases
in Illinois, we used an existing method to measure the percentage difference in model estimation
(Downs et al., 2018; Mao & Nekorchuk, 2013). The spatial accessibility for COVID-19 patients
was compared to the accessibility for the general population by calculating the percentage
difference, as:
VWEPRXMYYZ[\]^_19 OVWEPRXMYY`abacde fgh

DiffACC=

VWEPRXMYY`abacde fgh

(5)

A positive value of the comparison is derived if the normalized accessibility for the
COVID-19 patients is larger than that for general population, indicating the proportion of
oversupply of beds. The zero value indicates that the accessibility for the COVID-19 patients and
that for the general population are identical. Otherwise, if the value is negative, then the patients
might have struggles to access healthcare resources. Because the values of the comparison are
relative measurements, they do not directly quantify the magnitude of issues for particular areas
to access healthcare resources.

3. Results
We used the P-E2SFCA method to assess the spatial accessibility of hospital beds for the
general population and the COVID-19 patients in Chicago and Illinois, USA, as of April 10,
2020. In addition, the results from the P-E2SFCA method identified the areas in which hospital
beds are relatively more or less accessible. Our analysis also helps identify the areas in which
there are imbalances between the accessibility of healthcare resources and needs for the general
population and the COVID-19 patients.
Based on the accessibility measure in Chicago (Figure 6), we found that the accessibility
of hospital beds is spatially varying. The areas with spatial accessibility measures at or above the
median are located near the center of Chicago and extending northwestward. The areas with
lower accessibility measures are located in southern Chicago. In other words, people living in
central and northern Chicago have better accessibility to hospital beds than those living in
southern Chicago, as hospitals and hospital beds are mostly located in central Chicago.
In addition, the difference in access to hospital beds for the general population and for the
COVID-19 patients is not statistically significant (t(6556)=-0.8185, p>0.05), as shown in Figure 7.
This implies that access to hospital beds was similar for the general population at risk and for the
patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The median of the normalized accessibility measure is equal
to 0.5044 for the general population and 0.4915 for the COVID-19 patients, respectively. In
general, hospital beds are distributed with high accessibility in Chicago.
As shown in Figure 8, the spatial accessibility measure is also spatially varying across
Illinois. For the general population, the areas with higher spatial accessibility are relatively
uniformly distributed throughout Illinois (Figure 8(a)). On the other hand, only some areas have
relatively higher spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients in Illinois (Figure 8(b)).
In central Illinois (e.g., Peoria and Springfield), COVID-19 patients have higher accessibility to
hospital beds than those living in the other areas of Illinois. We also found that COVID-19
patients have lower accessibility in some areas of Chicago (i.e., northeastern Illinois). While
abundant resources are concentrated in Chicago (i.e., northeastern Illinois), the majority of the
Illinois COVID-19 cases occurred in Chicago.

Figure 8. Accessibility measure for Illinois: (a) general population; (b) COVID-19 patients.
In Illinois, many residents may not have adequate access to hospital beds (Figure 9). This
means that some may be struggling to get access to hospital beds at the state level. Population in
urbanized areas (e.g., Chicago, Peoria, Springfield) tend to have higher accessibility to the beds.
The median of the normalized accessibility measure is equal to 0.0190 for the general population
and 0.0003 for the COVID-19 patients, respectively. The difference in access to hospital beds for
the general population and for the COVID-19 patients is statistically significant (t(13909)=-20.086,
p<0.001).
Figure 10 presents the scatter plots elucidating whether there are imbalances between the
spatial accessibility for the general population and that for COVID-19 patients in Chicago (a)
and Illinois (b). Each dot represents the accessibility measure at each hexagon. Spearman’s
correlation coefficients are 0.9999 (p-value <0.001) and 0.4279 (p-value <0.001) for Chicago
and Illinois, respectively. If the correlation coefficient is close to 1, then there are less
imbalances in the spatial accessibility between the general population and COVID-19 patients.
Although the accessibility measures are not significantly different in Chicago, they are quite

different in Illinois. This means that some areas may need additional beds while the beds may be
abundant in other areas. In Figure 10(b), the areas having higher accessibility for the general
population, but lower accessibility for COVID-19 patients could be understood as the areas in
which additional beds may be needed. Furthermore, the number of COVID-19 cases is relatively
higher compared to existing accessible beds in these areas. On the other hand, the areas having
higher accessibility for COVID-19 patients, but lower accessibility for the general population
could be defined as the areas in which hospital beds may be abundant.

Figure 9. Accessibility measure for Illinois: (a) the general population; and (b) COVID-19
patients in Illinois. Note: the dotted lines refer to the average of accessibility measure. Y-axis
denotes the number of hexagons, since the accessibility is represented through the hexagons.
To identify the areas that need additional beds to resolve the inequality in access to
hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in Illinois, we compared the accessibility measure for
COVID-19 patients to that for the general population, based on equation (5). Figure 11 illustrates
the measure difference in Chicago (a) and in Illinois (b). The circles identify the areas where
beds may be abundant. Compared to the accessibility for the general population, COVID-19
patients have higher accessibility in northern Chicago. In other words, it is relatively more
difficult for COVID-19 patients living in southern Chicago to access hospital beds. This also
implies that the hospital beds are more densely located in northern Chicago. Therefore, it is

important to consider increasing the supply of beds on the southside via field hospitals and/or
reopening recently closed facilities.

At the state level, the hospital beds are not proportionally distributed, especially
considering the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. In Figure 11(b), the circles represent the
areas in which the beds may be abundant. Peoria is the most accessible area for hospital beds,
compared to the number of COVID-19 patients, and followed by Benton/Mt. Vernon, Danville,
Gibson City, Mattoon/Charleston, Springfield, and Ottawa. We found that additional beds are
needed in the Chicago area despite the substantial number of beds that are already available.
Given that COVID-19 cases mostly occurred in Chicago, additional beds may need to be
allocated to Chicago, especially the southern Chicago area.
3.2. Computational Performance
We assessed the computational performance of P-E2SFCA using the runtime in seconds
of both P-E2SFCA and E2SFCA implementations and ran both sets of code 10 times each to
calculate an average runtime in seconds. The computational experiments were conducted using
CyberGIS-Jupyter and Virtual ROGER (https://cybergis.illinois.edu/infrastructures/) (Wang,
2017). For computing the accessibility in Chicago, P-E2SFCA executed at 6 times faster (i.e., an
average of 942 seconds across ten runs to an average of 147 seconds) using 4 computing cores
not only by parallelizing computationally intensive parts of E2SFCA, but also by efficiently
aggregating results returned from parallel computing resources.
4. Concluding Discussion
Although extensive studies have focused on forecast (Roosa et al., 2020) and exploration
of space-time patterns and trends of COVID-19 cases (Desjardins et al., 2020; Grasselli et al.,
2020), research questions about the availability and capacity of healthcare resources (e.g.,
hospital beds, ventilators, healthcare personnel, and testing resources) for treating COVID-19
patients need rigorous investigations. This study has addressed the question of to what extent the
general population and COVID-19 patients in Illinois, USA have accessibility to healthcare
resources. Specifically, we compared the spatial accessibility for the general population to that
for the COVID-19 patients. The comparison identifies which geographic areas may need
additional healthcare resources to accommodate COVID-19 patients.

Specifically, our findings based on the P-E2SFCA method provide an improved
understanding of spatial accessibility of hospital beds for the general population and the COVID19 patients in Chicago and Illinois, USA, as of April 10, 2020. In addition, our analysis helps
identify the areas in which there are imbalances between the accessibility for the general
population and that for COVID-19 patients. The results also reveal which areas have relatively
higher spatial accessibility of hospital beds.
Comparing the accessibility measures for the general population to that for COVID-19
patients, we found the areas that need additional healthcare resources to improve spatial
accessibility in Illinois. In general, there are no significant difference in spatial accessibility
measures between the general population and COVID-19 patients in Chicago. Nonetheless,
given that confirmed COVID-19 cases in southern Chicago may exceed the capacity of
healthcare resources available there, additional resources should be allocated to southern
Chicago. At the state level, some areas (e.g., Peoria) have much higher accessibility for COVID19 patients than for the general population. Compared to the number of confirmed cases, these
areas have a resource surplus. On the other hand, the Chicago area needs more resources than
other areas, considering the increasing number of confirmed cases in Chicago.
This study has several limitations. The accessibility measures near state boundaries might
be underestimated because we did not include the hospitals in neighboring states (e.g., Indiana,
Wisconsin, Iowa, Kentucky, and Missouri), which Illinois residents might visit. Because there
are different population distribution patterns, the catchment size parameter needs to be chosen to
account for the difference of such patterns (McGrail, 2012). Therefore, assessing the impact of
varying catchment size on the spatial accessibility measure (Luo and Whippo, 2012) would be
worth for future research. In addition, the COVID-19 cases may not be exhaustively counted
because many cases were not confirmed due to having no or light symptoms (Bai et al., 2020).
Also, our analysis did not distinguish between non-acute inpatient bed versus intensive care unit
bed capacities. Given that the number of confirmed cases is expected to increase in Illinois, to
assess spatial accessibility for COVID-19 patients over time is an important research topic. Then
it would be interesting to explore the dynamics between the demand of COVID-19 patients and
the supply of healthcare resources. Although our results may help identify the areas where
resources are abundant or insufficient, we did not assess how much resources need to be
allocated, which should be another future research topic. While our cyberGIS approach to

parallel computing of E2SFCA achieves significant computational performance gains, future
work needs to be done to determine the most optimal means to resolving the computational
intensity, especially for the purpose of applying the analysis to larger geographic areas or to
national and international assessment.
In summary, rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources is critical to
the fight against the COVID-19 crisis, particularly for better understanding how well the
healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save people’s lives. Based on this study, policymakers
and public-health officials should consider optimizing the allocation of existing healthcare
resources or putting additional resources into low accessibility areas. At the same time, strict
quarantine, social distancing, and isolation of known cases by individuals and communities are
important to slow down the spread of COVID-19 (Anderson et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith &
Freedman, 2020), which in turn, help to address the important spatial accessibility issues.
