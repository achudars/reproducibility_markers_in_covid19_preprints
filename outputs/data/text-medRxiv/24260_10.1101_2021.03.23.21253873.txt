Both Canada and the United States have advanced medical care systems, and in both countries
the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on population health and the economy. The
similarities and differences between the two countries’ healthcare systems have made crossnational comparisons an important source of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of their
respective health systems (1). During the COVID-19 pandemic, both COVID-19 cases and
deaths per capita have been higher in the United States than in Canada, while decline in gross
domestic product has been 2.1% greater in Canada than in the U.S. (2). Greater economic losses
in Canada may reflect more aggressive use of non-pharmaceutical measures such as business and
school closures to reduce disease transmission. Per capita attack rates and deaths seen in the
United States represent a counterfactual, which Canada might have experienced with less
aggressive disease control measures.

Methods and Results

We obtained national COVID-19-attributed death estimates from Public Health Agency of
Canada and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention current as of March 14, 2021.
At that time 22,290 COVID-19-attributed deaths were recorded in Canada (0.59 deaths per 1000
population), as compared to 507,227 deaths in the United States (1.56 deaths per 1000
population) (RR 2.67, 95% CI 2.63 to 2.70) (3, 4). We plotted cumulative proportions of deaths
by age (based on midpoints of age groups) (Figure). It can be seen that the U.S. curve for
cumulative deaths by age is “pulled” to the left, demonstrating greater proportionate mortality in
younger individuals in the United States.

We estimated the number of excess deaths in Canada under a United States-like scenario using
direct standardization. As Canadian and U.S. death data were reported using slightly different
age groupings we reallocated Canadian deaths using death distributions by two-year age
increments available for the province of Ontario (as of March 11, 2021). Observed deaths in
Canada were divided by expected deaths based on U.S. mortality incidence to calculate
standardized mortality ratios. Observed deaths were subtracted from expected deaths to
calculate deaths averted (Table). Lastly, we divided averted deaths by age-specific case-fatality
estimates from Ontario to estimate averted cases. We applied age-specific risks of hospital
admission and intensive care admission, derived from Ontario case data, to calculate hospital and
intensive care admissions averted. We estimated that the more aggressive approach to pandemic
suppression employed in Canada averted approximately 6 million counted cases, 45,000 deaths,
185,000 hospital admissions and 38,000 ICU admissions that would have been seen had the
country’s public health response been similar in stringency to that employed in the United States.
Averted hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions were concentrated in the 50-to-74
year age band. Data used for calculations are available online at

Discussion

The Canadian response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been less effective in limiting disease
and death than that seen in other large federal democracies like Australia, though there has been

notable heterogeneity in the response to COVID-19 within Canada, with Atlantic provinces and
Northern Territories having effectively achieved COVID-19 elimination, despite intermittent setbacks (5). However, given cultural similarities, intertwined economies, and a long, undefended
border, the natural comparator for Canada’s COVID-19 response is the response in the United
States. Here we show that application of U.S.-derived age- and disease-specific mortality for
COVID-19 to Canada would result in a counterfactual in which deaths, hospitalizations, and
intensive care admissions are markedly increased. In particular, Canada’s response appears to
have protected middle-aged adults against severe diseases from COVID-19 far more effectively
than the public health response in the United States.

There are three important limitations to our analysis: while we attribute improved outcomes in
Canada to concrete public health actions, it is also possible that they reflect differences in
structural, societal factors that have enhanced COVID-19 risk in the United States. Excess risk
of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related death in the United States has been associated with lower
income status and non-white ethnicity, but similar relationships have been observed in Canada as
well (6, 7). A second key limitation of our analysis is our use of Ontario-specific case fatalities,
and hospitalization and intensive care admission risks, to estimate outcomes averted at a national
level; however, Ontario’s epidemiology is likely similar to that of Canada overall, both because
of similarities in demographics and health systems across the country, and also because the
population of Ontario represents approximately 40% of the Canadian population, and 35% of
Canada’s COVID-19 case load, such that the Province’s epidemiology strongly influences that of
Canada as a whole. Lastly, we assume that attribution of COVID-19 deaths in Canada and the

United States occurs in a comparable manner; questions around over- and under-assignment of
COVID-19 mortality have been raised in both countries (8).
