As of March 20, 2020, there were 234,073 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease
2019 (Covid-19) and 9,840 deaths worldwide 1. Older age and elevated d-dimer are
reported risk factors for Covid-19 2,3. However, whether early radiographic change is a
predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all
laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large
regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji
Hospital ethics committee approved this study.
A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA
detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5
remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were
male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were
fever, cough, and dyspnea (Table S1). When compared with survivors, non-survivors
were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase

(LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I (Table S1, S2). In a
multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated
LDH were independent risk factors for fatality (Table S3).

total severity score (A) and the number of involved lung lobes (B) for CT images of survivors
and non-survivors within the first week (≤7d) after symptom onset. C, total severity score for

used to compare the values of survivors in Week 1 with those of non-survivors, and with those
of survivors in Week 2, 3, 4, respectively. ****, p < 0.0001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05.

Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We
used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the

Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes
within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors
(Table S4). Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score (≥15)
(odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved
lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly
associated with fatality (Figure 1A B, Table S5). Moreover, in this subset of patients
with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent
risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older
age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I)
(Table S5). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity
score peaked in the second week (Figure 1C, Table S4).
This report suggests that the extent of lung lesions in early CT images is a potential
predictor of poor outcome of Covid-19. This will help clinicians to identify the patients
with poor prognosis at early stage.

Methods
Study Population and Data Collection
This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics board of Tongji
Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Written informed consent
was waived. The study included all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
admitted to a quarantine unit of Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan,
China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed
according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guideline 1. Confirmed cases
were defined by the positive findings in reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chainreaction (RT-PCR) assay of throat swab specimens. Clinical characteristics, laboratory
test results, and treatment information were extracted from electronic medical records.
All laboratory testing and radiological examination were performed according to the
clinical care needs of the patient.
RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2
Throat swab specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-PCR
according to the WHO protocol 3. The following primers and probes were used for realtime RT-PCR detection of N gene of SARS-CoV-2: N forward primer 5'GAGCCTTGAATACACCAAAAG-3',

System, Milwaukee, USA) or Somatom Definition AS+ (Siemens Healthineers,
Forchheim, Germany). Tube voltage was 100 or 120 kV, and automatic tube current
modulation was 100 - 400 mA. All images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of
1.0mm or 1.25mm. The CT images were reviewed by two radiologists (ZW and NW)
who were blinded to the final outcome of the patients. Images were reviewed
independently. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.
A scoring system was used to estimate the extent of lung opacification based on the
area involved 2. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from 0 to 5 as: 0, no
involvement; 1, < 5% involvement; 2, 5% - 25% involvement; 3, 26% - 49%
involvement; 4, 50% - 75% involvement; 5, > 75% involvement. The total severity
score was the sum of scores of each lobe, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25
(maximum involvement).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was done with SPSS Statistics Software (version 26; IBM, New
York, USA). Continuous variables were presented as median (IQR) and analyzed using
Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were presented as number (%) and
analyzed by χ² test or Fisher’s exact test between survivors and non-survivors where
appropriate. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to
estimate odds ratios and the 95% confidence intervals of the risk factors associated with
fatal outcome. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Data are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available
data. p values comparing survivor with non-survivor were calculated by χ² test, Fisher’s exact test,
or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriated. Covid-19, coronavirus disease 2019.

Data are median (IQR), n (%), or n/N (%), where N is the total number of patients with available data. χ² test, Fisher’s exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test were used
to compare the values between survivors and non-survivors as appropriate.

Figure S1. Transverse CT images of a 38-year-old man with Covid-19. A, Normal CT
images on the day when the patient had initial symptoms (day 1). B, day 9 after
symptom onset, bilateral and peripheral ground-grass opacity associated smooth
interlobular and intralobular septal thickening (crazy-paving pattern). C, day 15 after
symptom onset, peripheral predominant consolidation pattern with air bronchograms in
right upper and lower lobes. D, day 23 after symptom onset, previous opacifications
were dissipated into ground-grass opacities and irregular interlobular and intralobular
septal thickening (reticulation pattern). E, day 30 after symptom onset, further
resolution of the lesions, ground-glass opacities and reticulation patterns remained.

Figure S2. Transverse CT images of a 41-year-old woman with Covid-19. A-C, day 6
after symptom onset, multifocal consolidations and ground-glass opacities aﬀecting the
bilateral, subpleural lung parenchyma associated with crazy-paving pattern. D-F, day
10 after symptom onset, bilateral extensive ground-glass opacities, involving nearly the
entire lower lobes and right middle lobe, and most of the upper lobes, giving a white
lung appearance, with air bronchograms and crazy-paving pattern. The patient died 8
days after this scan.
