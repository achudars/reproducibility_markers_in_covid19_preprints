Abstract
Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1-4.
Yet, longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here, we serially analysed
immune responses in 113 COVID-19 patients with moderate (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) disease.
Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T
cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes.
Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a
progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with
severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe
disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data
identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type1/2/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The
immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth
factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all

four signatures. Thus, we identified development of a maladapted immune response profile associated
with severe COVID-19 outcome and early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease
trajectories.

Introduction

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), a highly infectious, zoonotic virus that exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)5,6 as a cell entry receptor. SARS-CoV-2 has generated an ongoing global pandemic that reaches
almost every country, linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in less than 6 months. Clinical
presentation of COVID-19 involves a broad range of symptoms comprising fever, fatigue, diarrhoea,
conjunctivitis and myalgia, in addition to the respiratory-specific symptoms including dry cough,
shortness of breath and viral pneumonia3,7,8. In severe cases, patients develop critical disease
characterized by pneumonia that may be exacerbated by pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, cardiac
damage, pulmonary emboli, thromboses, systemic shock, and multi-organ failure3,9. Understanding the
nature of the immune response that leads to recovery over severe disease is key to developing effective
treatment against COVID-19.

Coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), typically induce strong inflammatory responses and associated
lymphopenia10,11. Initial studies characterizing immune cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19
patients have reported increases in inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils and a sharp decrease in
lymphocytes1-4. Moreover, in parallel with observations of infections with MERS and SARS, an
inflammatory milieu containing IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α has been associated with worse disease
outcomes1,2,4,8,12. Despite these analyses, immune response dynamics during the course of SARS-CoV-2
infection and its possible correlation with clinical trajectory remain unknown.

Immune responses against pathogens are divided roughly into three types13-15. Type-1 immunity,
characterized by T-bet-dependent responses and IFN-γ, is generated against intracellular pathogens
including viruses. In type-1 immunity, pathogen clearance is mediated through effector cells including
ILC1, NK cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and Th1 cells. Type-2 immunity, which relies on the GATA-3
transcription factor, mediates anti-helminths defense through effector molecules including IL-4, IL-5, IL13, and IgE designed to expel these pathogens through the concerted action of epithelial cells, mast cells,
eosinophils, and basophils. Type-3 immunity, orchestrated by the RORγt-induced cytokines IL-17, IL-22
secreted by ILC3 and Th17 cells, is mounted against fungi and extracellular bacteria to elicit neutrophildependent clearance. In this study, we focused on the longitudinal analysis of these three types of immune
responses to COVID-19 patients and identified correlations between distinct immune phenotype and
disease.

Results
Overview of immunological features in COVID-19 patients
To determine immune phenotypes underlying disease trajectories in COVID-19, we conducted a
longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients. One hundred and thirteen COVID-19 patients admitted to
Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) between the 18th of March through the 27th of May 2020, were
recruited to the Yale IMPACT study (Implementing Medical and Public Health Action Against
Coronavirus CT). We assessed a) viral RNA load quantified by RT-qPCR using nasopharyngeal swabs,
b) levels of plasma cytokines, chemokines, and c) leukocyte profiles by flow cytometry using freshly
isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed 253 collections and follow-up
measurements on the patient cohort with a range of one to seven longitudinal time-points that occurred 351 days post symptom onset. In parallel, we enrolled 108 volunteer healthcare workers (HCW) into the

IMPACT study, whose samples served as healthy controls (SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-qPCR and
serology).

Basic demographic information stratified by disease severity is displayed in Extended Table 1.
Hospitalized patients were stratified into moderate and severe based on oxygen levels and intensive care
unit (ICU) requirement (Fig.1a). Among our cohort, patients who developed moderate or severe disease
did not significantly differ with respect to age or sex. Body mass index (BMI) was generally increased
among patients with severe disease, and extremes in BMI correlated with an increased relative risk of
mortality (RR BMI ≥ 35: 1.62 [95% CI .81-3.22]) (Extended Table 1, Extended data Fig. 1a,b). Exposure
to select therapeutic regimens of interest was assessed in both moderate and severe disease severities
(Extended Data Fig 1c). Initial presenting symptoms demonstrated a preponderance of headache
(54.55%), fever (64.47%), cough (74.03%), and dyspnoea (67.09%) with no significant difference in
symptom presentation between moderate or those that eventually developed severe disease. As reported
elsewhere, blunting of taste (hypogeusia) and smell (anosmia) were occasionally reported in both
moderate and severe disease but demonstrated no significant difference between groups16. Finally,
mortality was significantly increased in patients who were admitted to the ICU over those who were not
(27.27% vs 3.75%; RR: 7.27 [95% CI 2.1 – 25.19], p-value < .001) (Extended Table1).

We analysed PBMC and plasma samples from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients and healthy
HCW donors (Fig. 1a) by flow cytometry and ELISA to quantify leukocytes and soluble mediators,
respectively. An unsupervised heatmap was constructed from the main innate and adaptive circulating
immune cell types; this analysis revealed marked changes in COVID-19 patients compared to uninfected
HCW (Fig. 1b). As recently reported

number and frequency in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, even after normalization for age as a possible
confounder (Extended Data Fig.1d). Granulocytes such as neutrophils and eosinophils are normally
excluded from the PBMC fraction following density gradient separation. However, low density

granulocytes are present in the PBMC layer from peripheral blood collections in patients with
inflammatory diseases17. We observed an increases in monocytes, and low density neutrophils and
eosinophils that correlated with the severity of disease (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Additionally,
we observed increased activation of T cells and a reduction in HLA-DR expression by circulating
monocytes1 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). A complete overview of PBMC cells subsets is presented in
Extended Data Fig. 2.

Severe disease caused by infections with MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses are
associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS)1,2,8,11,12,18,19. To gain insights into key differences in
cytokines, chemokines, and additional immune markers between moderate and severe patients, we
correlated the measurements of these soluble proteins across all patients’ time-points that were collected
(Fig. 1d). We observed a “core COVID-19 signature” shared by both moderate and severe groups of
patients defined by the following inflammatory cytokines that positively correlated with each other; these
include:IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-12 p70, and IFN-α (Fig. 1d). In severe patients, we observed an
additional inflammatory cluster defined by: TPO, IL-33, IL-16, IL-21, IL-23, IFN-λ, eotaxin and eotaxin
3 (Fig. 1d). Most of the cytokines linked to CRS, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18 and TNF-α,
showed increased positive associations in severe patients (Fig. 1d, e, f and Extended Data Fig. S3). These
data highlight the broad inflammatory changes, involving concomitant release of type-1, type-2 and type3 cytokines in severe COVID-19 patients.

Longitudinal immune profiling of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients
Our data presented above, as well as previous single-cell transcriptome and flow cytometry-based studies

, depicted an overt innate and adaptive immune activation in severe COVID-19 patients. We sought

to determine the temporal dynamics of immune changes through longitudinal sample collection and
analysis of key immunological markers in moderate versus severe patients. Longitudinal cytokines

correlations, measured as days from symptom onset (DfSO), indicated major differences in immune
phenotype between moderate and severe disease apparent after day 10 of infection (Fig. 2a). In the first
10 DfSo, severe and moderate patients displayed similar correlation intensity and markers, including the
overall “core COVID-19 signature” described above (Fig. 2a). However, after day 10 these markers
steadily declined in patients with moderate disease; in contrast, severe patients maintained elevated levels
of these core signature makers. Notably, additional correlations between cytokines emerged in patients
with severe disease following day 10 (Fig. 2a). These analyses strongly support the observation in the
overall analysis described in Fig. 1, in which TPO and IFN-α strongly associated with IFN-λ, IL-9, IL-18,
IL-21, IL-23, and IL-33 (Fig. 2a). These observations indicate sharp differences in the expression of
inflammatory markers along disease progression between patients who exhibit moderate vs. severe
COVID-19 symptoms.

Temporal analyses of PBMC and soluble proteins in plasma, either by linear regression or grouped
intervals, supported distinct courses in disease. IFN-α levels were sustained at higher levels in sever
patients while they declined moderate patients (Fig. 2b). Plasma IFN-λ levels increased during the first
week of symptom onset in ICU patients and remained elevated in later phases (Fig. 2b). Additionally,
inflammasome-induced cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18 were also elevated in severe patients
compared to patients with moderate disease at most time-points analysed (Fig. 2c). Consistently, IL-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), induced by IL-1R signalling as a negative feedback regulator22, also showed
increased levels in ICU patients from day 10 of disease onset (Extended Data Fig. 4).

With respect to type-1 immunity, an increased number of monocytes was observed at approximately 14
DfSo in severe but not in moderate COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2d). The innate cytokine IL-12, a key
inducer of type-1 immunity13,14, displayed a similar pattern to IFN-γ; increasing over time in severe
patients but steadily declining in moderate patients (Fig. 2d). IFN-γ can be secreted by ILC1, NK, and

Th1 cells. By intracellular cytokine staining, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with moderate disease
secreted comparable amounts of IFN-γ to those from severe patients. Together with the severe T cell
depletion in severe patients (Fig. 1), our data suggested that secretion of IFN-γ by non-T cells (ILC1,
NK), or non-circulating T cells in tissues were the primary contributors to the enhanced levels observed in
severe patients (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Type-2 immune markers continued to increase in severe patients over time, as indicated by strong
correlations observed in late time points from severe patients (Fig. 2a). Eosinophils and eotaxin-2
increased in severe patients and remained higher than levels measured in moderate patients (Fig. 2e).
Type-2 innate immune cytokines, including TSLP and IL-33, did not exhibit significant differences
between severe and moderate patients (Fig. 2e). Hallmark type-2 cytokines, including IL-5 (associated
with eosinophilia) and IL-13 (Fig. 2e), were enhanced in patients with severe over moderate disease. In
contrast, IL-4, was not significantly different. However, IL-4, similar to IL-5 and IL-13, exhibited an
upward trend over the course of disease in severe patients (Fig. 2e). A type-2 antibody isotype was also
increased; IgE levels were significantly higher in severe patients and continued to increase during the
disease course (Fig. 2e).

IL-6 linked to CRS was significantly elevated in severe patients, although circulating neutrophils did not
show a significant increase in our longitudinal analysis (Fig. 2f). Hallmarks of type-3 responses were
observed in severe patients, including increased plasma IL-17A and IL-22, as well as IL-17 secretion by
circulating CD4 T cells as assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 5).
These data identify broad elevation of type-1, type-2 and type-3 signatures in severe cases of COVID-19,
with distinct temporal dynamics and quantities between severe and moderate patients.

Nasopharyngeal viral load correlates with elevated cytokines

We next asked which early immunological profile was correlated with worse disease trajectory and
whether these parameters were influenced by the viral load. We first measured viral load kinetics by serial
nasopharyngeal swabs. While viral RNA load was not significantly different at any specific time point
analysed post symptom onset between severe and moderate patients, moderate patients showed a steady
decline in viral load over the course of disease, and severe patients did not (Fig. 3a). Regardless of
whether the patients exhibited moderate or severe disease, viral load significantly correlated with the
levels of IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF-α and TRAIL (Fig. 3b). Additionally, several chemokines responsible for
monocyte recruitment significantly correlated with viral load only in patients with severe disease
(Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). These data indicated that nasopharyngeal viral load positively correlates with
plasma levels of interferons and cytokines.

Early cytokine profile distinguishes moderate and severe disease outcomes
Next, we examined whether specific early cytokine responses are associated with severe COVID-19. To
this end, we conducted an unsupervised clustering analysis using patients’ baseline measurements,
collected before 12 DfSO (Fig. 3c). Three main clusters with correlation to distinct disease outcome
emerged. These were characterized by 4 distinct immune signatures: Signature A contained several
stromal growth factors including EGF, PDGF, VEGF that are mediators of wound healing and tissue
repair23, as well as IL-7, a critical growth factor for lymphocytes. Signature B consisted of eotaxin 3, IL33, TSLP, along with IL-21, IL-23 and IL-17F, thus representing type-2 & 3 immune effectors. Signature
C comprised of mixtures of all immunotypes, including type-1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, IL-15, IL-2,
TNF-α), type-2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), as well as type-3 (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-17E, IL-22). Finally,
signature D contained a number of chemokines involved in leukocyte trafficking including CCL1, 2, 5, 8,
15, 21, 22, 27, CXCL9, 10, 13, and SDF1.

Cluster 1 was comprised primarily of patients with moderate disease who experienced low occurrences of
coagulopathy, shorter lengths of hospital stay, and no mortality (Fig. 3c, d). The main characteristics in
this cluster were low levels of inflammatory markers and similar or increased levels of parameters in
signature “A” containing tissue reparative growth factors (Fig. 3c). Clusters 2 and 3 were characterized by
the rise in inflammatory markers, and patients belonging to these clusters had higher incidence of
coagulopathy and mortality, which was more pronounced in cluster 3 (Fig. 3c,d). Cluster 2 showed higher
levels of markers in signatures “C and D”, which included IFN-α, IL-1Ra and several hallmark type-1,
type-2 and type-3 cytokines, than patients in cluster 1, but lower expression of markers in signatures “B,
C and D” than in Cluster 3 (Fig. 3c,d). Cluster 3 displayed heightened expression of markers in signatures
“B, C and D” than other clusters. Cluster 3 showed particular enrichment in expression of markers in
signature “B”, which include several innate cytokines including IFN-λ, TGF-α, TSLP, IL-16, IL-23 and
IL-33, and markers linked to coagulopathy, such as TPO (Fig. 3c, d).

We next ranked these parameters obtained at early time points as predictors of severe disease outcomes
(Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 6c). In both cases, plasma inflammatory markers strongly associated with
severe disease outcomes. For example, high levels of type I IFN (IFN-α) before the first 12 DfSo
correlated with longer hospitalization time and death (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 6c). Moreover, patients
who ultimately died of COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated levels of IFN-α, IFN-λ, IL-1Ra as
well as chemokines associated with monocytes and T cells recruitment and survival, including CCL1,
CLL2, MCSF, IL-2, IL16 and CCL21 before the first 12 DfSO (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 6c). These
analyses identify specific immunological markers that appear early in the disease that strongly correlate
with worse outcomes and death.

Retrospective analysis of immune correlates of COVID-19 outcomes

To further evaluate potential drivers of severe COVID-19 outcome in an unbiased manner, we performed
unsupervised clustering analysis including all patients and all timepoints using cytokines and chemokines
(Fig. 4a). Notably, three main clusters of patients emerged and the distribution of patients in early timepoint clusters identified in Fig. 3c matched the distribution for the all-time point analysis (Fig. 4a) in 96%
of cases. Cluster 1 was comprised primarily of moderate disease patients and showing improving clinical
signs (Fig. 4a-d, Extended Data Fig. 7). This cluster contained only two deceased patients. Cluster 1 was
characterized by low levels of inflammatory markers as well as similar or increased expression of markers
in the signature A’ (Fig. 4a-d), which mostly matched signature A markers described in Fig. 3c. Clusters
2 and 3 contained patients displaying coagulopathy and worsened clinical progression, including higher
number of deceased patients (Fig. 4a-d, Extended Data Fig. 7).

Clusters 2 and 3 were driven by a set of inflammatory markers falling into signatures B’, C’ and D’ to
some extent, which highly overlap with the “core signature” cytokines and chemokines identified in Fig.
1 as well as the signatures “B and C” identified in Fig. 3c. These include type-1 immunity markers,
including IL-12, chemokines linked to monocyte recruitment and IFN-γ, type-2 responses, such as TSLP,
chemokines linked to eosinophil recruitment, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and type-3 responses, including IL-23,
IL-17A and IL-22. Additionally, most CRS and inflammasome-associated cytokines were enriched in
these clusters, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α (Fig. 4a). These findings were consistent
with generalized estimating equations that identified relationships between biomarkers death over time
(Extended Data Fig. 8). Together, these results identify groups of inflammatory, as well as potentially
protective, markers that correlated with COVID-19 trajectory. The immune signatures that correlate with
recovery (cluster 1) and worsening diseases (cluster 2 < cluster 3) were remarkably similar whether we
took prospective (Fig. 3) vs. retrospective (Fig. 4) approaches.

Discussion

Our longitudinal analyses of hospitalized COVID-19 patients revealed key temporal features of viral load
and immune responses that distinguish disease trajectories during hospitalization. Using patients’ immune
response readouts, unsupervised clustering revealed 3 distinct profiles that influence the evolution and
severity of COVID-19. Cluster 1, characterized by low expression of proinflammatory cytokines and
enrichment in tissue repair genes, followed a disease trajectory that remained moderate leading to
eventual recovery. Clusters 2 and 3 were characterized with highly elevated proinflammatory cytokines
(cluster 3 being more intense), developed worse disease and many died of COVID-19. Thus, in addition
to the well-appreciated CRS-related pro-inflammatory cytokines, we propose four signatures of immune
response profiles that more accurately subset patients into distinct COVID-19 disease course.

In addition to dynamic changes in leukocyte subsets, such as prolonged lymphopenia and elevation of
monocytes and neutrophils in severe disease, we observed an increase in eosinophils in patients admitted
to the ICU. By focusing on hallmark cytokines of type 1, type 2 and type 3 immunity, we found that while
all are higher in severe disease than moderate disease, type 2 signatures, including eotaxin 2, IgE,
eosinophils, IL-5 and IL-13, continue to become elevated during disease course in the severe patients.
While nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels were not significantly different between moderate and severe
patients at the specific time points examine post symptom onset, linear regression analyses showed slower
decline in viral load in patients admitted to the ICU. Viral load was highly correlated with IFN-α, IFN-γ
and TNF-α, suggesting that viral load may drive these cytokines, and that interferons do not successfully
control the virus. Moreover, many interferons, cytokines, and chemokines were elevated early in disease
for patients who ultimately died of COVID-19. This suggests possible pathological roles associated with
these host defence factors.

Our comprehensive analysis of soluble plasma factors revealed a broad misfiring of immune effectors in
COVID-19 patients, with early predictive markers, distinct dynamics between types of immune

responses, among moderate and severe disease outcomes. Unsupervised clustering identified a set of
inflammatory markers highly enriched in severe patients. By following these patients over time (Figure
2), we observed a mixed response of type-1, -2 and -3-associated cytokines. A preprint study assessing
inflammatory cytokines increased in COVID-19 in comparison to influenza patients only observed
heightened IL-6 and IL-8 (Ref.

24

); the latter was not enriched in clusters 2 or 3 in our analysis.

Interestingly, this study also observed high circulating levels of IL-1Ra in severe patients, which we also
identified. We likewise observed that IL-6 may be an important clinical target in COVID-19. It was both
highly enriched in patients with severe disease in clusters 2 and 3. In fact, all of our ICU patients,
including the ones who succumbed to the disease, received Tocilizumab, an IL-6R blocking antibody,
according to a protocol uniquely instituted at Yale New Haven Hospital COVID-19. Recent studies
reported positive outcomes with this treatment, including a reduction in an inflammatory-monocyte
population associated with worse outcomes25. This highlights the need for combination therapy to block
other cytokines highly represented by these clusters, including inflammasome-dependent cytokines and
type-2 cytokines.

Our data, suggest a pathological role for type-2 immune responses to COVID-19 (Ref.

26

). Previous

studies have proposed a pathogenic role for type-2 immunity in influenza, as well as SARS-CoV
infection27,28. In addition to key cytokines associated with type-2 immunity, including IL-5 and IL-13, we
observed an early and persistent increase in IgE levels in severe COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, we
also observed transient increases in circulating eosinophil levels - paralleled by simultaneous elevations in
Type II cytokines - among severe COVID-19 patients despite widespread use of glucocorticoids among
this population (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Given the potent eosinopenia induced by glucocorticoids, further
study exploring the extent of margination of Type II effector cells into COVID-19 affected tissues, and
their role in disease progression, is warranted29. A retrospective cohort study, also deposited as preprint,
reported positive clinical outcomes upon administration of famotidine, a histamine antagonist, to COVID19 patients30. Similarly, a preprint publication analysing regulatory networks downstream of ACE2 and

the spike protein activator, TMPRSS2, which is part of the mucus secretory pathway, speculated that
upregulation of type-2 immunity and IFN-responses, could increase ACE2 expression thus aggravating
disease31,32.

Another notable observation from this study is the overwhelming association between antiviral IFNs and
disease. While type I and III IFNs are generally required for viral clearance, during persistent viral
infection, or under high viral loads, conditions generally observed in elderly patients, IFN responses can
lead to pathological outcomes33. Our study found that IFN-α is elevated in patients with severe disease,
and higher levels correlate with death. The correlation between increased viral load and increased
secretion of type I IFN suggest that persistence of virus drives type I IFN secretion, but the prolonged
secretion and failure to control virus instead leads to a proinflammatory cytokine storm. This vicious
cycle can lead to the worsening of disease symptoms, ventilator use and ultimately death.

In addition to CRS-associated cytokines, we observed a correlation with cytokines linked to the
inflammasome pathway, which partially overlap with CRS, including IL-1β and IL-18. Indeed, it is
plausible that inflammasome activation , along with a sepsis-like CRS, triggers vascular insults or tissue
pathology observed in severe COVID-19 patients

34

. The immune dysfunction observed in severe

COVID-19 patients included hallmarks of type-3 cytokines, IL-17 and IL-22. The primary function of IL17 function is tissue neutrophil recruitment, which is associated with COVID-19 severity. Additionally,
IL-17 is known to enhance the production of inflammatory cytokines associated with COVID-19, as well
as lung pathology, including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6

35

. Our results suggest that a multi-faceted

inflammatory response is associated with late COVID-19 severity. This raises the possibility that early
immunological interventions that target inflammatory markers predictive of worse disease outcome are
preferred to blocking late-appearing cytokines. Overall, our analyses provide a comprehensive
examination of the diverse inflammatory dynamics during COVID-19 and possible contributions by

provide bases for more targeted treatment of COVID-19 patients based on early cytokine markers, as well
as therapies targeted to enhancing tissue repair and promoting disease tolerance.

Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by Yale Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review Boards
(FWA00002571, Protocol ID. 2000027690). Informed consents were obtained from all enrolled patients
and healthcare workers.

Patients
135 COVID-19 patients admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) between March 18th and May
5th, 2020 were included in this study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, as recently described36,
approximately every four days for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR analysis where clinically feasible. Paired
whole blood for flow cytometry analysis was collected simultaneously in sodium heparin-coated
vacutainers and kept on gentle agitation until processing. All blood was processed the same day as
collection from patients. Patients were scored for COVID-19 disease severity through review of electronic
medical records (EMR) at each longitudinal time point. Scores were assigned by a clinical infectious
disease physician according to a custom developed disease severity scale. Moderate disease status
(Clinical Score 1, 2 and 3) was defined as: (1) SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization without
supplemental oxygen, (2) infection requiring non-invasive supplemental oxygen (<3 L / min, sufficient to
maintain greater than 92% SpO2), (3) infection requiring non-invasive supplemental oxygen (> 3L
supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 92%, or, required > 2L supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2
> 92% and had a high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) > 70) and received tocilizumab. Severe disease
status (Clinical score 4 and 5) was defined as infection meeting all criteria for clinical score 3 while also
requiring admission to the YNHH Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and > 6L supplemental oxygen to maintain
SpO2 > 92% (4); or infection requiring invasive mechanical ventilation / extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) in addition to glucocorticoid / vasopressor administration (5). Clinical score 6 was
assigned for deceased patients. The use of tocilizumab can increase circulating levels of IL-6 through

inhibition of IL-6Rα-mediated degradation. Analysis of our cohort indicate higher plasma levels of IL-6
in both moderate and severe patients that received tocilizumab treatment (Extended data Fig. 1d).

For all patients, days from symptom onset were estimated according to the following scheme: (1) highest
priority was given explicit onset dates provided by patients; (2) next highest priority was given to the
earliest reported symptom by a patient, and (3) in the absence of direct information regarding symptom
onset, we estimated a date through manual assessment of the electronic medical record (EMRs) by an
independent clinician. Demographic information was aggregated through a systematic and retrospective
review of patient EMRs and was used to construct Extended Table 1. Symptom onset and etiology was
recorded through standardized interview with patients or patient surrogates upon enrollment in our study,
or alternatively through manual EMR review if no interview was possible due to clinical status.

Viral RNA measurements
RNA concentrations were measured from nasopharyngeal samples by RT-qPCR as previously
described36. Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from 300 μl of viral transport media (nasopharyngeal
swab) using the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a
modified protocol and eluted into 75 μl of elution buffer.
For SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, 5 μl of RNA 371 template was tested as previously described37, using
the US CDC real-time RT-qPCR primer/probe sets for 2019-nCoV_N1, 2019-nCoV_N2, and the human
RNase P (RP) as an extraction control. Virus RNA copies were quantified using a 10-fold dilution
standard curve of RNA transcripts that we previously generated37. The lower limit of detection for SARSCoV-2 genomes assayed by qPCR in nasopharyngeal specimens was established as recently described37.
In addition to a technical detection threshold, we also utilized a clinical referral threshold (detection limit)
to either: (1) refer asymptomatic HCWs for diagnostic testing at a CLIA-approved laboratory, or (2)
cross-validate results from a CLIA-approved laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 qPCR+ individuals upon study

enrollment. Individuals above the technical detection threshold, but below the clinical referral threshold,
are considered SARS-CoV-2 positive for the purposes of our research study.

Isolation of patient plasma
Plasma samples were collected after whole blood centrifugation at 400 g for 10 minutes at RT without
brake. The undiluted serum was then transferred to 15 ml polypropylene conical tubes, and aliquoted and
stored at -80 °C for subsequent analysis.

Cytokine and chemokine measurements
Patient serum was isolated as before and aliquots were stored in -80°C. Sera were shipped to Eve
Technologies (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) on dry ice, and levels of cytokines and chemokines were
measured with Human Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 71-403 Plex Panel (HD71). All the samples
were measured upon the first thaw.

Isolation of PBMCs
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized whole blood using
Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich, #10771-500ML) density gradient centrifugation in a biosafety level 2+
facility. After isolation of undiluted serum, blood was 1:1 diluted in room temperature PBS and layered
over Histopaque in a SepMate tube (Stemcell Technologies; #85460) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at
1200g. The PBMC layer was isolated according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed twice
with PBS prior to counting. Pelleted cells were briefly treated with ACK lysis buffer for 2 minutes and
then counted. Percentage viability was estimated using standard Trypan blue staining and an automated
cell counter (Thermo-Fisher, #AMQAX1000).

1-2 x 106 cells / well in a 96 well U-bottom plate. Cells were resuspended in Live/Dead Fixable Aqua
(ThermoFisher) for 20 minutes at 4°C. Following a wash, cells were then blocked with Human TruStan
FcX (BioLegend) for 10 minutes at RT. Cocktails of desired staining antibodies were directly added to
this mixture for 30 minutes at RT. For secondary stains, cells were first washed and supernatant aspirated;
then to each cell pellet a cocktail of secondary markers was added for 30 minutes at 4°C. Prior to analysis,
cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μL of 4% PFA for 30 minutes at 4°C. For intracellular
cytokine staining following stimulation, cells were resuspended in 200 μL cRPMI (RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin,
1mM Sodium Pyruvate, and 50uM 2-Mercaptoethanol) and stored at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, these
cells were washed and stimulated with 1X Cell Stimulation Cocktail (eBioscience) in 200 μL cRPMI for
1 hour at 37°C. 50 μL of 5X Stimulation Cocktail (plus protein transport 442 inhibitor) (eBioscience) was
added for an additional 4 hours of incubation at 37°C. Following stimulation, cells were washed and

resuspended in 100 μL of 4% PFA for 30min at 4°C. To quantify intracellular cytokines, these samples
were permeabilized with 1X Permeabilization Buffer from the FOXP3/ Transcription Factor Staining
Buffer Set (eBioscience) for 10 minutes at 4°C. All subsequent staining cocktails were made in this
buffer. Permeabilized cells were then washed and resuspended in a cocktail containing Human TruStan
FcX (BioLegend) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Finally, intracellular staining cocktails were directly added to
each sample for 1 hour at 4°C. Following this incubation, cells were washed and prepared for analysis on
an Attune NXT (ThermoFisher). Data were analysed using FlowJo software version 10.6 software (Tree
Star). The specific et of markers used to identify each subset of cells are summarized in Extended Data
Table 8.

Statistical analysis
The patients and its measurements were clustered using the kmeans algorithm available within the
ComplexHeatmap package38. To determine the optimum number of clusters, we ran the data matrix
within the NBClust package39. Prior to data visualization, each patient was scaled by subtracting each
measurement with the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Multiple group comparisons were
analyzed by running both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis) statistical tests with
the Dunn's Test post hoc tests. Mutual information analyses were performed using the Caret R package
and visualized with ggPlot2. Multiple correlation analysis was performed by executing spearman
correlations with the Hmisc R package and visualized with corrplot, only showing correlations with
pvalue less than 0.05. For generalized linear models (GLM), we calculated the incident risk ratio (IRR) by
conducting a Poisson regression with a log link and robust variance estimation; this value approximates
the risk ratio estimated by a log-linear model. For generalized estimating equation models (GEE), we
calculated the incidence risk ratio (IRR) in the same way as for non-GEE GLM models, assuming an
independent correlation structure. All models controlled for participant sex and age.

Extended Data Fig. 7: Distribution of days from symptom onset stratified by collection time point.
Violin plots comparing the distributions of days from symptom for each patient ordered by sequential
IMPACT study time points (1-8). Study time points 7 and 8 are represented by discrete points for the
single patient collected at each. Violin plots display median values (solid line) and associated quartiles
(dashed lines).

Extended Data Fig. 8: Risk of ICU admission and death according to biomarkers levels. Forest plots
comparing the risk of death among ill patients. Each effect estimate represents an individual regression
estimate with a Poisson family, log link, and robust variance estimation; each model accounts for repeated
measures within one individual through the use of generalized estimating equations (GEE).
Measurements are divided into three time-periods: 0-12 days after symptom onset, 12-19 days after
symptom onset, and ≥20 days after symptom onset. If an individual had more than one measurement of a
biomarker during any particular time period, we used the average of all values. Each model controls for
participant age and sex.
