SUMMARY

35

The immune response to SARS-CoV2 is under intense investigation, but not fully

36

understood att this moment. Severe disease is characterized by vigorous

37

inflammatory responses in the lung, often with a sudden onset after 5-7 days of

38

stable disease. Efforts to modulate this hyperinflammation and the associated

39

acute respiratory distress syndrome, rely on the unraveling of the immune cell

40

interactions and cytokines that drive such responses. Systems-level analyses are

41

required to simultaneously capture all immune cell populations and the many

42

protein mediators by which cells communicate. Since every patient analyzed will

43

be captured at different stages of his or her infection, longitudinal monitoring of

44

the immune response is critical. Here we report on a systems-level blood

45

immunomonitoring study of 39 adult patients, hospitalized with severe COVID-19

46

and followed with up to 14 blood samples from acute to recovery phases of the

47

disease. We describe an IFNg – Eosinophil axis activated prior to lung

48

hyperinflammation and changes in cell-cell coregulation during different stages of

49

the disease. We also map an immune trajectory during recovery that is shared

50

among patients with severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

66

Since its emergence in December 2019 the Severe Acute Respiratory

67

Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) causing the disease COVID-19 has

68

infected millions of individuals and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths

69

worldwide. The betacoronavirus has high degree of sequence homology with

70

previous SARS-CoV and MERS coronaviruses and bind to the angiotensin-

71

converting enzyme 2, ACE2-receptor to enter cells in the respiratory and

72

intestinal epitelium (Lu et al., 2020).

73
74

Cells recognize the presence of the virus and its RNA via cytosolic and

75

endosomal Pathogen recognition receptors, PRR and elicit antiviral response

76

programs (Medzhitov and Janeway, 2002). The two main components of such

77

antiviral programs involve the production of type I and III Interferons that induce

78

downstream transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes that

79

interfere with viral replication in the cell (Lazear et al., 2019). The second

80

element of the antiviral response program is the secretion of chemokines that

81

recruit specialized cells of the immune system to clear the virus. SARS-CoV-2,

82

like other viruses, has evolved countermeasures to these defenses and in

83

particular, the virus efficiently interferes with IFN-signaling and the induction of

84

ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Blanco-Melo et al., n.d.). In contrast, pro-

85

inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are induced normally and this

86

imbalance between antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses is a key feature of

87

COVID-19 (Vabret et al., 2020).

91

Another observation during the COVID-19 pandemic is the different disease

92

courses among different individuals infected by SARS-CoV2 virus. Most

93

individuals present with a very mild disease, often asymptomatic, and a few

94

develop a life-threatening disease requiring intensive care. The strongest

95

determinant of disease severity is age, with children presenting almost

96

exclusively with mild disease (Brodin, 2020), while the elderly, over 70 years of

97

age are much more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Males and females are

98

infected at similar rates, but males are much more likely to develop severe

99

disease and requiring intensive care (Jin et al., 2020). Obesity, smoking and

100

hypertension are other risk factors for severe COVID-19 (Huang et al., 2020). On

101

the other hand, COVID-19 contrast with other respiratory viral infections in that

102

pregnant women do not seem to be more likely to develop severe disease and

103

this is also true for patients with various forms of immunodeficiency. One likely

104

reason for these observations is that severe disease is associated with exuberant

105

immune responses and a skewed immune regulation against pro-inflammatory

106

responses in pregnancy and T-cell deficiencies in transplan patients make such

107

hyperinflammatory responses less likely. To treat hyperinflammation in severe

108

COVID-19 we need to better understand the cells involved, their interactions and

RESULTS

121

Longitudinal profiling of patients with COVID-19

122

Given the enormous diversity among immune systems in humans, longitudinal

123

monitoring of patients is required to appreciate immunological changes occurring

124

during a disease process. Also, systems-level analyses methods such as Mass

125

cytometry (Brodin, 2018) enable all immune cell populations to be distinguished

126

and analyzed in a given blood sample, allowing for coordinated changes across

127

cell populations to be revealed. We have combined these cellular measurements

128

with analyses of 180 unique plasma proteins using Olink analyses (Lundberg et

129

al., 2011) (Fig. 1a). In order to understand systems-level immune responses

130

during moderate to severe COVID-19 we monitor longitudinal samples from 39

131

patients, some treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and some treated in

132

regular hospital wards with oxygen support but no mechanical ventilation (Fig.

133

1b). Patients did not receive immunomodulatory therapies in this cohort and the

134

immunological changes reflect the natural course of the infection and all patients

135

survived the infection.

136
137

The characteristics of acute and recovery phases of COVID-19

138

Clinical measurements were taken from acute and recovered patients including

139

body temperature, white blood cell counts and lymphocyte counts. Milder cases

140

of COVID-19 showed lower body temperatures as well faster normalization of

141

body temperatures as compared to severe cases who fluctuated more over time

142

(Fig. 2A). The white blood cell (WBC) counts gave a possible correlate to the

143

stage of the infection. High WBC counts are often a reflection of acute

144

inflammation and immune responses and in severe patients we observed more

145

fluctuating levels of WBC over time (Fig. 2B). Also, there were no signs of

146

secondary bacterial infection in the patients in this cohort. Lymphopenia is one of

147

the common features of COVID-19 and the degree of lymphopenia predict

148

disease severity (Huang et al., 2020). Lymphocyte counts were measured and

149

found that milder cases recuperated their lymphopenia faster than severe cases

150

(Fig. 2C). This is in line with other previous reports (Lagunas-Rangel, 2020).

151

Plasma protein levels were observed and compared among acute and

152

recovered phases and map immune dynamics of severe COVID-19 (Fig. 2D-G).

153

Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IFNg predict disease severity. A

154

decreasing trend is observed in IFNg and IL-6 from early admission to the

155

hospital through recovery during the weeks of the study (Fig. 2D and 2F,

156

respectively). Similarly, DDX58, the Innate Immune Response Receptor also

157

called RIG-I, and the monocyte chemoattractant protein MCP-3, are elevated

158

during acute disease and decrease during recovery (Fig. 2E and 2G,

159

respectively).

160
161

The immune cell changes from acute to recovery phase of COVID-19

162

A defining feature of acute immune responses during COVID-19 is dramatic

163

changes in immune cell composition that can be informative of likely driving

164

factors and triggers. To understand severe COVID-19 better we plot relative

165

proportions of 57 immune cell populations over time in the 39 patients (Fig. 3).

166

We confirm the overrepresentation of Neutrophils over Lymphocytes during acute

167

infection, that is slowly reversed during the recovery phase (Fig. 3). This is in line

168

with reports suggesting the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and degree of

169

lymphopenia are predictive of disease severeity in COVID-19 (Lagunas-Rangel,

170

2020). The plasmablast response is clear and occurs during the first week after

171

admission in these patients (Fig. 3). The recovery of T-cells after the initial

172

lymphopenia occurs over the following 2-3 weeks and is dominated by CD127

173

expressing effector and central memory CD4+ T-cells, as well as CD57-

174

expressing and differentiated memory CD8+ T-cells (Fig. 3). Also, all Dendritic

175

cell (DC) subsets increased from acute to recovery phases, CD1c+ DCs, CD11c+

176

DCs and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) (Fig. 3). Also, despite a clear reduction in

177

relative abundance of neutrophils over time, the other granulocyte subsets,

178

Basophils and Eosinophils increased clearly from acute to recovery phases (Fig.

179

3), and both of these were among the most dynamic cell populations during

180

severe disease, suggestive of important contributions to the antiviral defense and

181

immunopathology.

182
183

Eosinophil activation and homing during acute COVID-19

184

Given the changes in eosinophil abundance above, we decided to study

185

Eosinophils more carefully. There are reports of strong GM-CSF responses in

186

lungs of COVID-19 patients (Zhou et al., 2020) and GM-CSF is known to

187

stimulate Eosinophils, particularly in interstitial pneumonia and allergic

188

inflammation (Taniguchi et al., 2000). Taking advantage of the detailed

189

longitudinal sample series, we used Partition-based graph abstraction, PAGA

190

(Wolf et al., 2019), to reconstruct single-cell phenotypic changes of blood

191

eosinophils during acute COVID-19 (Fig. 4). Leiden clustering found 12

192

Eosinophils subsets and the main groups are annotated by defining features

193

(Fig. 4A). By splitting cells obtained from the different longitudinal samples, time-

194

associated changes in eosinophil phenotypes are revealed with a transient

195

expansion of CD62L+ Eosinphils from day 2 to day 6 after admission (Fig. 4B).

196

CD62L-upregulation on Eosinophils have been reported to be induced by IFNg

197

(Momose et al., 1999), one of the most elevated cytokines in severe COVID-19,

198

and the IFNg levels show a slight increase right around the same time as the

199

expansion of CD62L+ Eosinophils (Fig. 4C). This phenotype of Eosinophils is

200

reminiscent of lung resident Eosinophils, rather than induced inflammatory

201

eosinophils in circulation and such ung-homing cells have previously been

202

reported as important homeostatic regulators of inflammatory responses in the

203

lung (Mesnil et al., 2016) (Fig. 4D). It is tempting to think that this transient

204

expansion of CD62L+ Eosinophils just prior to the time development of severe

205

lung hyperinflamation around 1 week after admission is related to this

206

immunopathology of the lungs in COVID-19 patients. To this end further

207

investigation into this Eosinophil - IFNg axis is required and might suggest novel

208

therapies targeting this response to mitigate ARDS and lung inflammation.

211

Adaptive immune cell dynamics during severe COVID-19

212

Adaptive responses to SARS-CoV2 are seen in most individuals, with one study

213

reporting CD4+ T-cell responses, and CD8+ T-cell response in nearly all patients

214

(Grifoni et al., 2020). Similarly, the majority of symptomatic patients seroconvert

215

within a few days and most developed high-titer antibody responses (Sun et al.,

216

2020), yet one study has reported that a significant proportion of patients with

217

COVID-19 do not develop neutralizing antibody responses (Robbiani et al.,

218

2020). To investigate the dynamics of adaptive immune cell responses in our

219

cohort we used the same PAGA approach as described above. We find a clear

220

Plasmablasts response early after admission (Fig. 5A). The CD4+ T-cell

221

response were initially dominated by effector and central memory responses,

222

followed by an increase in Tregs approximately four days after admission (Fig.

223

5B). The CD4+ T-cells were split into two effector cell populations based CD4-

224

expression level, possible reflecting an activation-induced downregulation in a

225

subset of CD4+ T-cells (Fig. 5B)(Grishkan et al., 2013). The CD8+ T-cell

226

responses are dominated by activated cells expressing high CD38 and also a

227

subset of effector cells upregulating the CD147 receptor from about one week

228

onwards (Fig. 5C). Gamma-delta TCR T-cells, (gdT-cells) and CD8+ T-cells

229

progressively upregulated the marker of terminal maturation CD57 from about 1

230

week onwards (Fig. 5C-D). These results are largely in agreement with other

231

recent reports (Mathew et al., 2020) and highlight the strong innate and adaptive

232

immune activation during acute COVID-19.

233
234

Cell-cell regulation varies over time during severe COVID-19

235

Immune responses are always concerted efforts made by multiple, specialized

236

cell populations communicating via direct interactions and secreted cytokines

237

and other mediators. By studying such cell-cell relationships a better

238

understanding of the systems-level response can be obtained. We generated

239

cell-cell correlation matrices using longitudinal cell population frequencies and

240

binned the samples into four phases from acute disease to recovery phase (Fig.

241

6A). We find that the first phase (day 0-4) is dominated by an inverse correlation

11

242

between neutrophils and a number of myeloid and lymphoid cell types, as

243

reflected in the elevated NLR, associated with severe disease (Lagunas-Rangel,

244

2020)(Fig. 6A). The following phase (day 6-8) is characterized by a strong

245

coordinated Plasmablast, B-cell and abT-cell module, and this is inversely

246

correlated with a strong Treg and CD11c+ DC module (Fig. 6A). From day 9

247

onwards a change is apparent with a shift towards a coregulated module

248

involving Eosinophils, pDCs, CD11c+ DCs, with CD8+ T-cells. This module is

249

largely maintained in the recovered patients, possibly reflecting a more normal

250

cell-cell relationship (Fig. 6A).

251
252

A prototype of a coordinated immune response to viruses is the appearance of

253

virus specific IgG antibodies because such responses elicited by B-cells require

254

help from CD4+ T-cells. Here we investigated the seroconversion in this cohort

255

and found strong induction of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein

256

(Receptor Binding Domain, RBD) in the majority of patients (Fig. 6B). This is in

257

line with similar analyses in other COVID-19 patients (Sun et al., 2020)(Amanat

258

et al., 2020). We were unable to test the neutralizing capacity of these antibodies

259

at this time, but another recent report has shown that a significant proportion of

260

patients mount antibodies that lack such neutralizing capacity (Robbiani et al.,

261

2020). To understand the immunological correlates of IgG responses to SARS-

262

CoV2, we devised a mixed effect model, using both plasma protein levels and

263

cell frequencies as predictors, taking days after admission into account as a fixed

264

effect (Chung et al., 2013). We found several features significantly associated

265

with IgG-responses, and in particular strong proinflammatory cytokines IFNg, IL-

266

6, and chemokines CXCL10 and MCP-2 (CCL8) are negatively associated with

267

anti-CoV2 IgG responses (Fig. 6C). In contrast the Neutrophil-recruiting

268

chemokine CXCL6 are positively associated with anti-CoV2 IgG responses and

269

so was the fraction of circulating Basophils (Fig. 6C). It is known that basophils

270

are able to bind antigens on their surface and potentiate humoral immune

271

responses (Denzel et al., 2008) and since basophils are depleted during acute

272

and severe COVID-19 (Fig. 3), our data collectively suggest that the degree of

12

273

basophil depletion might influence the efficacy of IgG-responses to SARS-CoV2.

274

It is believed that basophil mediated enhancement of B-cell responses occurs

275

through the production of either IL-4 or IL-6, but levels of the latter were found to

276

inversely associated with antibody responses (Fig. 6C) so it more likely that

277

another mechanism is responsible for the basophil enhancement of IgG

278

responses in the case of COVID-19. Collectively these results indicate a

279

coordinate adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV2, enhanced by basophils

280

and possibly suppressed by hyperinflammatory cytokine responses with high IL-6

281

levels during acute COVID-19.

284

A shared, integrated trajectory of recovery across patients

285

Since none of the patients in this cohort were treated with immunomodulatory

286

agents, and have recovered with supportive care alone, we reasoned that a

287

deeper investigation into the immunological changes during recovery from severe

288

COVID-19 would be informative about the underlying immune processes

289

involved. Given the strong interactions among immune cells and proteins in the

290

immune system we applied an integrative analysis method to search for a

291

multiomic trajectory of immune recovery. We used Multiomics Factor Analysis,

292

MOFA (Argelaguet et al., 2018). This method allowed us to search for latent

293

factors that best explain the variance across data types and use these to discern

294

any possible relationship with the process of recovery from disease.

295
296
297

We found ten latent factors that explained the variance in the combined dataset

298

(Fig. 7A), and out of those, latent factor 2 was associated with the transition from

299

300

among intensive care unit (ICU) or non-ICU ward patients and the levels of latent

301

factor 2 were highest in the samples taken from recovered patients (Fig. 7B). To

302

understand the biology of immune recovery we assessed the underlying features

303

contributing to latent factor 2. The plasma proteins changing the most all

304

decreased during recovery and most prominent were IL-6, MCP3, KRT19

305

(Keratin19), CXCL10, AREG and IFNg (Fig. 7C). Conversely the cells that

306

changed the most during recovery were classical and non-classical monocytes,

307

CD56dim NK cells, Eosinophils and gdT-cells, all increasing in relative proportions

308

during recovery (Fig. 7D). This shared, integrated trajectory reveal markers most

309

indicative of recovery in patients with severe COVID-19 and if verified in

310

independent sets of patients, these features could be valuable biomarkers to

311

monitor during disease progression in order to detect a switch from acute to

312

recovery phases in severe COVID-19.

313
314

In this manuscript we have performed an in depth, longitudinal analysis of the

315

immune system in patients with severe COVID-19 during acute disease and until

316

spontaneous recovery. The natural course of this process is mapped and found

317

to be similar among patients. We find changes in cell populations, such as

318

CD62L-expressing Eosinophils, triggered by IFNg and likely contributing to

319

hyperinflammation and ARDS during acute disease. We show that basophils are

320

depleted during acute disease but recuperate during recovery and the levels of

321

basophils are significantly correlated with the titers of IgG antibodies to SARS-

322

CoV2 produced by B-cells. In contrast, high levels of IL-6 and IFNg are negatively

323

associated with humoral responses. Finally, we uncover an immunological

324

trajectory of disease recovery shared among patients. These results can be

325

useful for the development of better immunomodulatory strategies to mitigate

326

hyperinflammatory responses, optimize antiviral IgG responses and monitoring of

327

disease progression and recovery in patients with severe COVID-19.

DISCUSSION

331

A number of researchers are studying the immune response to SARS-CoV2 and

332

we are learning that viral evasion of IFN-I/III signals and prevention of the normal

333

induction Interferon-stimulated genes and the antiviral state (Blanco-Melo et al.,

334

n.d.). At the same time the proinflammatory response is strong. Secretion of

335

chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines lead to influx of neutrophils and

336

myeloid cells into the lung with strong local inflammatory responses and

337

immunopathology (Vabret et al., 2020). Autopsy findings in patients succumbed

338

to COVID-19 are characterized by perivascular T-cell infiltration, microangiopathy

339

and widespread thrombosis in the lung tissue (Ackermann et al., 2020). The

340

induction of IL-6 during severe COVID-19 have led to trials of blocking antibodies

341

to the IL-6 receptor with mixed results. This is inspired by Cytokine Release

342

Syndromes, CSR seen in cancer immunotherapy also often treated with IL-6

343

blocking agents. However, there are a number of differences between severe

344

COVID-19 and CRS, such as lower IL-6 levels, death caused by respiratory

345

failure and thrombosis, rather than from circulatory failure and status epilepticus

346

as seen in CRS (Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020). In this respect the mechanisms

347

of severe COVID-19 are incompletely understood and better understanding is

348

required for improved immunomodulatory therapies to be devised and

349

immunopathology and mortality limited.

350
351

Human immune systems are highly variable (Brodin and Davis, 2016), and most

352

of this variation is explained by environmental exposures (Brodin et al., 2015),

353

particularly early in life (Olin et al., 2018). The role of genetic variation in immune

354

variation in general and in COVID-19 in particular is under investigation

355

(Casanova et al., 2020). Systems-level analysis methods are useful in human

356

immunology because they capture the many variable cell populations, proteins

357

and transcriptional programs involved in a complex immune response. Systems-

358

level analyses also allow for the inference of relationships among such immune

359

system components (Lakshmikanth et al., 2020). In this study we add to the

360

rapidly growing literature by providing a longitudinal, systems-level perspective

361

on the immune system changes from acute to recovery phases of severe

362

COVID-19 disease. Longitudinal analyses are important because cross-sectional

363

analyses carry the risk of capturing snapshots of patients at different stages of

364

the immune response and thereby misinterpret differences as qualitatively

365

different. The longitudinal sampling presented herein is a strength of the current

366

study. Another important aspect of this work is its use of whole blood, rather than

367

peripheral blood mononuclear cells, allowing neutrophils, and other granulocyte

368

populations to be included in the analysis and also reduce the technical sources

369

of variation caused by cell preparation and freezing (Brodin et al., 2019). By

370

using this more holistic and longitudinal approach to analyze the immune

371

response during severe COVID-19, we find previously unappreciated roles of

372

Eosinophils in the acute response. These cells play important roles in other

373

respiratory infections (Flores-Torres et al., 2019) but have not been implicated

374

much in COVID-19. The population of eosinophils that expand a few days after

375

admission to the hospital were carachterized by CD62L-expression, a previously

376

reported marker of lung eosinophils (Mesnil et al., 2016) and it is probable that

377

this IFNg-mediated upregulation of CD62L on eosinophils lead to the influx of

378

such cells into the lung tissue and the development of ARDS and clinical

379

deterioration often seen after about one week in many patients. The finding that

380

basophil levels are positively associated with humoral responses to SARS-CoV2

381

is intriguing and in line with previous studies in other viral infections (Denzel et

382

al., 2008). Further investigation will be required to understand the mechanisms

383

involved but it is likely not involving the production of IL-6 by basophils given that

384

plasma levels of this cytokine were inversely associated with IgG response titers

385

induced. Another possible mechanism involve IL-4 production by basophils,

386

known to potentiate B-cell responses to infection (Kawakami, 2008).

387
388

There has been a lot of concerns around antibody responses to SARS-CoV2 and

389

although nearly all patients with severe disease do produce antibodies in rather

390

high titers (Amanat et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020), the neutralizing capability of

391

such antibodies are variable (Robbiani et al., 2020). One hypothesis brought

392

forward as a possible explanation to the severe disease occuring often after a

393

week or so of stable disease is antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE)(Iwasaki

394

and Yang, 2020; Tetro, 2020). This occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies bind a

395

virus and via Fc-receptors bring viruses into new cell types, not expressing the

396

receptor required forviral entry, in this case ACE2. Such reponses are well known

397

for Dengue virus infection and could induce hyperinflammatory responses also in

398

COVID-19. We have found that a significant proportion of CD4+ T-cells in some

399

patients showed CD4 downregulation as a sign of possible cell activation, but

400

such downregulation can also occur if T-cells are directly infected (Xiang et al.,

19

401

2009). CD4+ T-cells do not express ACE2 (Uhlen et al., 2019), but could express

402

Fc-receptors and therby be subject to viral infection and replication via ADE. This

403

is speculative at this time but as more data on determinants of neutralizing

404

antibody responses the theory of ADE as a cause of severe COVID-19 will be

405

testable and have important implications for vaccine development (Iwasaki and

406

Yang, 2020). The influence of basophils in modulating humoral responses to

407

SARS-CoV2 uncovered herein should also be taken into account as basophils

408

are depleted during acute disease and the severeity if such depletion might be an

409

important determinant of the antibody response to the virus.

five days after hospitalization. We excluded patients who had been considered

631

by the attending clinician not to benefit from intensive care. We recruited 17

632

inpatients (9 females, 8 males) aged between 40 - 77 years. The duration of

633

hospitalization ranged from 5 to 38 days. Of these, 10 were admitted to the ICU,

634

and remained in intensive care for 1 - 27 days. Three patients required

635

mechanical ventilation for 3, 13 and 19 days, respectively.

636
637

Recovery phase patients

638

In addition to patients recruited during the acute phase of illness, we recruited a

639

separate cohort of recovered patients based on positive PCR (n=20) or high

640

clinical suspicion (n=2). These 22 subjects (age range 28 - 68 years; 11 females,

641

11 males) were included during convalescence 3-4 weeks after COVID-19

642

diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 detection. These patients were identified from

643

medical and laboratory records, contacted by phone and invited to donate a

644

blood sample.

645
646

METHOD DETAILS

647

Immunophenotyping by Mass Cytometry

648

Blood samples drawn from patients with COVID-19 were mixed with a whole blood

649

stabilizer (Brodin et al., 2019)(Cytodelics AB, Sweden) either immediately or within

650

1-3 hrs post blood draw and cryopreserved as per the manufacturer’s

651

recommendations. Samples were then thawed, and cells were fixed/RBCs lysed

652

using WASH # 1 and WASH # 2 buffers (Whole blood processing kit; Cytodelics

653

AB, Sweden) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. This was performed a

654

few days prior to barcoding and staining of cells. Post fix/lysis of cells, ~1-2x106

655

cells/sample were plated onto a 96 well round bottom plate using standard

656

cryoprotective solution (10% DMSO and 90% FBS) and cryopreserved at -80oC.

657
658

At the time of experimentation, cells were thawed at 37oC using RPMI medium

659

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and

660

benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, Sweden). Briefly, cells were barcoded using

automated liquid handling robotic system (Agilent technologies)(Mikes et al., 2019)

662

using the Cell-ID 20-plex Barcoding kit (Fluidigm Inc.) as per the manufacturer’s

663

recommendations. Samples were pooled batch wise by keeping together the

664

longitudinal samples from each patient in the same batch. Cells were then washed,

665

FcR blocked using blocking buffer (in-house developed recipe) for 12 min at room

666

temperature, following which cells were incubated for another 30 min at 4°C after

667

addition of a cocktail of metal conjugated antibodies targeting the surface antigens.

668

Cells were washed twice with CyFACS buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% sodium

669

azide and 2mM EDTA) and fixed overnight using 2% formaldehyde made in PBS

670

(VWR, Sweden). The broad extended panel of antibodies used are listed in

671

Supplementary Table 1. For acquisition by CyTOF, cells were stained with DNA

672

intercalator (0.125 μM Iridium-191/193 or MaxPar® Intercalator-Ir, Fluidigm) in 2%

673

formaldehyde made in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed

674

once with CyFACS buffer, PBS and milliQ water, and twice with Cell acquisition

675

solution (CAS) (Fluidigm). Cells were mixed with 0.1X Norm Beads (EQTM Four

676

Element Calibration Beads, Fluidigm) filtered through a 35µm nylon mesh and

677

diluted to 1000,000 cells/ml. Cells were acquired using Helios mass cytometer at

678

a rate of 300-500 cells/s using PSI system, CyTOF software version 6.5.358 with

679

noise reduction, a lower convolution threshold of 400, event length limits of 10-150

680

pushes, a sigma value of 3, and flow rate of 0.030 ml/min.

681
682

Antibodies and reagents

683

Purified antibodies for mass cytometry were obtained in carrier/protein-free buffer

684

and then coupled to lanthanide metals using the MaxPar antibody conjugation kit

685

(Fluidigm Inc.) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Following the protein

686

concentration determination by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm on a

687

nanodrop, the metal-labeled antibodies were diluted in Candor PBS Antibody

688

Stabilization solution (Candor Bioscience, Germany) for long-term storage at 4°C.

692

Serum or plasma samples collected from patients with COVID-19 (by spinning

693

blood at 2000g for 10min at 80 C for plasma collection or by collecting serum from

694

those blood samples from which PBMCs were isolated using gradient

695

centrifugation for future use and not intended for this study) were analyzed using

696

a multiplex proximity extension assay (OLINK Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden).

697

Each kit provides a microtiter plate for measuring 92 protein biomarkers. Two

698

panels, the Olink Immune Response and Inflammation panels. Each well contains

699

96 pairs of DNA-labeled antibody probes. Samples were incubated in the presence

700

of proximity antibody pairs tagged with DNA reporter molecules. When the

701

antibody pair bounds to their corresponding antigens, the corresponding DNA tails

702

form an amplicon by proximity extension, which can be quantified by high-

703

throughput real-time PCR.

704
705

Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response

706

Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured using indirect

707

immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

708

(ELISA) using SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) as the antigen. The

709

IFA was conducted as described (Haveri et al., 2020). The RBD ELISA was done

710

following a recently published protocol (Amanat et al., 2020; Stadlbauer et al.,

711

2020). The RBD antigen was produced by transient transfection of RBD plasmid

712

to Vero E6 cells and the produced protein was purified following established

713

protocol (Stadlbauer et al., 2020). The raw data is available in Supplementary

714

722

MOFA (Argelaguet et al., 2018) uses a set of data matrices as input, plasma

723

protein expression and cell abundance datasets were used to build the

724

MOFAobject with MultiAssayExperiment. The MOFA object was trained in R

725

through the reticulate package with 10 factors and a variance threshold of 0.01%.

726

Both omics datasets were processed individually to remove any features

727

resulting in zero or low variance before fitting the model. Convergence of the

728

model was assessed using the change in ELBO (deltaELBO) to verify it fit the

729

convergence threshold which is considered to be between 1 and 10. Multiple

730

models were run under different initializations to validate that factors were

731

consistent across trials for model selection.

732
733

Partition-based graph abstraction of single-cell data

734

The CyTOF data were first preprocessed with arcsin h and scaled to unit

735

variance and then partitioned into different subpopulations according to our in-

736

house supervised learning algorithm. For each subpopulation, the phenotypic

737

changes over different time points are inferred with a trajectory inference method

738

called PAGA (Wolf et al., 2019). In brief, PCA was first applied to reduce the

739

number of features to 20, and then the clusters were detected with Leiden

740

method (Traag et al., 2019). Afterwards, the Leiden output was used by PAGA to

741

infer a trajectory map of clusters. Finally, the PAGA graph was taken as the initial

742

position by ForceAtlas2 (FA)(Jacomy et al., 2014) for the single-cell level

743

visualization.

744
745

Mixed effects modeling

746

A partially Bayesian method was applied with blme package on both datasets

747

(plasma protein expression and cell abundance) to produce maximum a posteriori

748

(MAP) estimates (Chung et al., 2013). This provided the ability to nest the

749

variables, and account for days from admission as well as RBD levels.
