Abstract
Lateral flow device (LFD) viral antigen immunoassays have been developed around the world as diagnostic tests
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. They have been proposed to deliver an infrastructure-light, cost-economical solution
giving results within half an hour. Here we report on standardised laboratory evaluations of LFDs, and for those
that met the published criteria, field testing in the Falcon-C19 research study and UK pilots (UK COVID-19 testing
centres, hospital, schools, armed forces). 4/64 LFDs so far have desirable performance characteristics (Orient
Gene, Deepblue, Abbott and Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test). All these LFDs have a viral
antigen detection of >90% at 100,000 RNA copies/ml. 8951 Innova LFD tests were performed with a kit failure
rate of 5.6% (502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1), false positive rate of 0.32% (22/6954, 95% CI: 0.20-0.48). Viral antigen
detection/sensitivity across the sampling cohort when performed by laboratory scientists (156/198, 95% CI 72.484.3) was 78.8%. Our results suggest LFDs have promising performance characteristics for mass population
testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals. The Innova LFD shows good viral antigen
detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential
issues. These results support the expanded evaluation of LFDs, and assessment of greater access to testing on
COVID-19 transmission.

Introduction
National governments and international organisations including the World Health Organisation (WHO) and
European Commission have highlighted the importance of individual testing, mass population testing and
subsequent contact tracing to halt the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID1,2,3
19.
The current diagnostic test involves reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of
nose/throat swabs in specialised laboratories. Such capacity in the UK is currently estimated at ~500,000
tests/day4–7 and this is used with contact tracing procedures and mobile applications to identify close
8–10
symptomatic contacts of infected symptomatic individuals.
However, there are significant challenges in
creating testing capacity to identify those with asymptomatic infections or to test contacts of individuals with
COVID-19. To date, turnaround time for RT-PCR has been typically slow (>24 hours).
To better understand and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is an urgent need for large-scale, accurate,
affordable and rapid diagnostic testing assays, with the ability to detect infectious individuals. Lateral flow device
(LFD) immunoassays can be designed to test for different protein targets and are routinely used in healthcare
settings principally as a result of their affordability, ease of use, short turnaround time, and high-test accuracy. In
brief, a sample is placed on a conjugation pad where the analyte (or antigen) of interest is bound by conjugated
antibodies. The analyte-antibody mix subsequently migrates along a membrane by capillary flow across both
‘test’ and ‘control’ strips. These strips are coated with antibodies detecting the analyte of interest and a positive
test is confirmed by the appearance of coloured control and test lines.11
Newly developed SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs identify the presence of specific viral proteins, using conjugated
antibodies to bind spike, envelope, membrane or nucleocapsid proteins. In contrast to the IgM/IgG “antibody
tests”, these antigen tests directly identify viral proteins, and are not reliant on the host’s immune response. In
contrast to RT-PCR, results for LFDs are observed in 10-30 minutes depending on the device, providing a
window for early interventions to halt the chain of transmission earlier in the disease course when individuals are
most infectious.12
To date, many manufacturers have developed first-generation rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting LFDs.
However, many of these tests have not been independently validated. There is evidence of variable performance
when assessing test sensitivity and specificity, although several candidates looked promising on the basis of
13–15
early data.
An independent national evaluation of these devices is important to facilitate population-level or
mass testing initiatives globally.
Here, we report the diagnostic performance of first-generation SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting LFD for rapid
point-of-care (POC) testing in work that was commissioned by the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care
(DHSC) from PHE Porton Down and the University of Oxford.

Results
Phase 1
A total of 132 suppliers of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection LFDs were identified and referred to the DHSC for
initial Phase 1 review. Among these, at the time of publication, 64 were selected by the DHSC for further
evaluation by the UK lateral flow oversight group.
Phase 2
As part of Phase 2 evaluations, 9,692 LFD tests were performed at PHE Porton Down across the 64 candidate
devices as of the 3rd December 2020. 5 LFDs had a kit failure rate above the pre-specified threshold for
exclusion (>10%), 17 kits had a false-positive rate below the pre-defined specificity threshold (<97%) and 28 kits
2
a false-negative rate below the LOD threshold (<60% at 10 pfu/m). In total, across all three criteria, nineteen kits
performed at a level in accordance with the UK Lateral Flow Oversight Group’s a priori “prioritisation criteria”. All
nineteen kits also passed cross-reactivity analyses against seasonal human coronaviruses.
Phase 3
To date, eight LFDs have passed Phase 3a evaluation, namely: Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative
Test (Innova), Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co. Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette (Swab) (Orient Gene),
Anhui Deepblue Medical Technology COVID-19 (Sars-CoV-2) Antigen Test kit (Colloidal Gold) (Deepblue),
Fortress Diagnostics Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test (Fortress), Roche SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test
(SD Bio swab), Surescreen Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette (Nasopharyngeal swab
(Surescreen) and Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott) (Supplementary Table 1). Three LFDs
did not pass 3a evaluation and the remaining LFDs are currently undergoing evaluation. Four LFDs (Deepblue,
Innova, Orientgene, Abbott) have passed Phase 3b evaluation (Table 1, Supp Figure 1), one LFD did not pass
and the remainder have not been evaluated.

Extended Innova LFD evaluation (Phases 2-4)
The limit of detection of the Innova LFD (Table 2) was determined as part of Phase 2 evaluations for the Innova
test. This analysis consisted of saliva spiked with SARS-CoV-2 with stock of SARS-CoV-2 with a standardised
PFU. Under these ideal concentrations, at an estimated PFU of 390/mL, which corresponds to a Ct of ~25, the
LFD identified all samples.

Our phase 4 evaluation focused on field testing of the Innova LFD, for which we had a sufficient supply of kits
available for wider testing at the time. Device specificity was determined through an analysis of 6954 tests from
evaluation phases 2-4. The percentage of false-positives ranged from 0.00-0.49%, with an overall specificity of
99.68%. The false-positive rate was centre-dependent (p=0.014, Fisher’s exact test). These evaluations noted
that where there were challenges in interpreting the results when the test result was “weak” (i.e. the test line was
very faint) (Table 3).

Across Phase 2-4 evaluation stages, 8,951 Innova LFD tests were performed, including a diverse cohort of
populations as part of Phase 3b and Phase 4 testing, namely out-patient SARS-CoV-2 cases, healthcare staff,
armed forces personnel and secondary school children. The overall kit failure rate for the Innova LFD was 5.6%
(502/8951, 95% CI: 5.1-6.1) (Table 4). The most common reason for kit failure was poor transfer of the liquid
within the device from the reservoir onto the test strip.

Viral antigen detection/sensitivity in individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Innova LFD was
assessed in the Phase 3b evaluation as part of the FALCON-C19 research study. Optimal viral antigen
detection/sensitivity when performed by laboratory scientists, was 78.8% (95% CI 72.4-84.3%; 156/198 cases
where a paired PCR was performed; see below for differing performance by test operator category). Subgroup
analyses showed there were no discernible differences in viral antigen detection/sensitivity in those without
symptoms vs. symptomatic individuals (27/41 [65.9%] vs. 95/344 [72.4%], p=0.38). We did not find any evidence
of associations between LFD positivity and symptoms or past medical history, with the exception of presence of
headache (Supplementary Table 2).
The association between Innova LFD viral antigen detection/sensitivity and estimated viral load/Ct value was
explored using the paired RT-PCR VTM swab sample taken at the same time as the swab used for LFD. There
was a strong association between viral load detection (RNA copies/mL) determined through RT-PCR and viral
antigen detection by LFD (Figure 1). Confirming earlier analyses, sensitivity of LFDs is highest in samples with
18 19
higher viral loads.

Within the 3b FALCON-C19 study, LFDs were also assessed by sampling 150uL of viral transport medium (VTM)
solution instead of using dry swabs; this was associated with poorer performance rate (Supp Figure 2). The use
of dry swabs forms the basis of the manufacturer’s instructions for use. This was likely due to a dilution factor
involved in placing the swab first into VTM and then analysing the VTM sample, and highlights potential issues in
generating direct comparisons between LFDs and VTM samples (Supp Figure 2).

LFD test performance by operator
As part of Phase 3b-4 evaluations, work was performed to report on the effect of the operator on viral antigen
detection/sensitivity in RT-PCR-positive cases using the Innova LFD. Tests were classified according to whether
they were performed by a laboratory scientist, a fully trained research health care worker or by a self-trained lay
individual working at a regional NHS Test and Trace centre. Performance was optimal when the LFD was used
by laboratory scientists (156/198 LFDs positive [78.8%, 95% CI: 72.4-84.3%]) relative to trained healthcareworkers (156/223 LFDs positive [70.0%, 95% CI: 63.5-75.9%]) and self-trained members of the public given a
protocol (214/372 LFDs positive [57.5%, 95% CI: 52.3-62.6%]; p<0.0001).

Discussion
We report on our national evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen-detecting LFDs, focussing on the Innova
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, which has a viral antigen detection (sensitivity) of 78.8% when
performed by laboratory scientists and a specificity of 99.7%, using RT-PCR as ‘gold standard’ for positive and
negative status. Test performance to detect SARS-CoV-2-positive samples was improved at lower Ct
values/higher viral loads, and were >90% at Ct values <25 (equating to ~390 pfu/mL, 100,000 RNA copies/ml)
(Supplementary Table 3). There is an expanding body of evidence that suggests viral load/antigen is important
20
as individuals with the highest viral loads are the most infectious, and the presence/absence of viral antigens
determined by LFDs is more strongly associated with a viral culture than RT-PCR positivity.21 In our evaluation,
test performance was largely maintained across different settings and cohorts; however, performance was partly
operator-dependent and kit failures are not infrequent.
Our experience is that many LFDs entering our national evaluation program do not perform at a level required for
mass population deployment and this reflects the literature. To date, an increasing number of evaluations of
24
SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting LFD have been published with variable results. A number of LFDs show good
25 13 19 26 27
28 29
or acceptable sensitivity and specificity
, however, many studies have identified tests with poor
30 15
sensitivities or specificities.
A challenge for most countries during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been the expansion of capacity for
diagnostic testing to support the identification of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This would aid in offering
testing to “contacts” of COVID-19 and enable targeted testing to better safeguard vulnerable populations e.g.
care home residents. Reliance on RT-PCR involves significant infrastructural and specialist human resources to
implement at increasing scale. Both the World Health Organisation and European commission have issued
guidance supporting wider implementation of antigen-targeting LFDs, and in November, Slovakia became the
1,3,31
first country in the world to implement entire population testing using LFDs.
The UK has similar aspirations
to pursue a strategy of mass testing and has implemented a city wide mass testing in Liverpool using the Innova
32
LFD in this study.
It is important to note that there are some potential issues with considering RT-PCR as the gold standard test for
COVID-19. Many individuals have persisting viral RNA fragments that can linger for weeks-months without any
evidence of active viral replication; in this instance a PCR-positive is likely to overcall the “infectious” status of an
individual 33 Indeed, when compared to the ability to perform viral culture, data suggest that RT-PCR tends to
overestimate the presence of replicating or infectious virions.34
In field testing, performance of the Innova LFD was dependent on the test operator. Individuals who had read a
protocol immediately prior to self-sampling did not perform as well as individuals with hands-on training, or
clinical laboratory personnel who had performed several hundred LFD tests. Like other operator-dependent
procedures, further work is required to determine the duration and content of “training” to derive optimal test
performance. We also assume that the use of LFDs to successfully identify individuals with higher viral loads and
enabling an earlier diagnosis will be of benefit in interrupting transmission, however, this remains to be proven.
SARS-CoV-2 control will benefit from a variety of testing strategies. This might include those optimised for
determining past infection/exposure (e.g. serology), those that are of benefit in determining current/recent
infection (e.g. RT-PCR), or those identifying potential infectivity. A combination of approaches incorporating the
strengths of each of these tests can be effectively used for individuals and for population-level management of
the pandemic. Approaches to testing will remain relevant even when effective vaccines become available as it
35
may take several months for an appreciable effect on transmission to be fully realised.
In conclusion, we completed late stage evaluations of seven LFDs. We report sensitivities of 70-80% and
specificities ≥99.7% for each LFD evaluated in phase 3b, which involved testing by laboratory personnel or
trained healthcare professionals. To identify patients with higher viral loads (Ct<25), each LFD had >90%
sensitivity. Sensitivity was lower in phase 4 evaluations, while specificity was maintained. The simplicity of LFDs,
without a requirement for specialist training or equipment, mean that they are an attractive option for mass
testing. Future research should focus on post-implementation evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, including the
potential benefit of regular serial sampling to improve accuracy and reduce transmission.

Pre-defined and publically available “prioritisation” criteria to pass on to the next evaluation phase had to be met
for LFDs, consisting of (i) a kit failure rate of <10%; (ii) an analytical specificity of ≥97%, and (iii) an analytical
LOD of >9 of 15 (60%) at 102 pfu/mL, corresponding to a RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of approximately 25
(~100,000 RNA copies/ml); and (iv) lack of cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses to further test analytical
specificity.

Evaluation using patient samples retrospectively was started in August 2020 at PHE Porton Down. Samples were
obtained from a secondary healthcare setting (Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust).

• 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples: fresh samples held refrigerated were supplied the day after they
were tested negative by RT-PCR by the laboratory service at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.
• 200 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples: swabs collected in VTM from patients admitted to hospital during
17
the first wave of the UK pandemic (March-June 2020). These were diluted 1:4 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
negative saliva, aliquoted and frozen at -20°C for later use. For each positive sample, in addition to the
original diagnostic RT-PCR Ct value, a confirmatory RT-PCR was performed at PHE Porton Down on the
diluted sample to determine the new Ct value.

A phased evaluation of available SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs was undertaken.
Department of Health and Social Care evaluation (Phase 1 evaluation)
The DHSC identified manufacturers supplying SARS-CoV-2 antigen LFDs that could enable mass testing at a
population level. A desktop review was performed to ensure there were appropriate instructions for use and to
16
assess manufacturers’ claimed performance and manufacturing capabilities.
Pre-clinical evaluation (Phase 2 evaluation)
Pre-clinical evaluation of candidate LFDs was performed by trained laboratory scientists at Public Health England
(PHE) Porton Down. LFDs were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 spiked positive controls and known negative
controls, consisting of saliva collected from healthy adult staff volunteers.

We undertook a field evaluation using samples from volunteers in the community in collaboration with the
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded CONDOR Platform “COVID-19 National Diagnostic
Research and Evaluation Platform”. This was performed within the FALCON-C19 study (Facilitating Accelerated
Clinical validation Of Novel diagnostics for COVID-19, 20/WA/0169, IRAS 284229), between 17th September and
rd
23 October 2020. This involved the recruitment and re-testing of consenting adults with a RT-PCR-confirmed
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of the original PCR result.
For the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, testing was additionally performed for a subset of
samples on-site at four COVID-19 testing centres by trained research staff using the “dry swabs” to evaluate
“real-life”/diagnostic performance. Dry swabs are those that are not placed into viral transport medium prior to
performing the LFD test.
Community field service evaluation (Phase 4 evaluation)
Wider field service evaluations were performed within a number of UK institutions and settings. These
evaluations utilised the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test. These institutions included a
secondary healthcare setting (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford), PHE Porton Down, armed forces members
(following an outbreak) and in secondary schools (pupils aged 11-18). Evaluations were also undertaken at
regional COVID-19 testing centres as part of an NHS Test and Trace service evaluation involving the general
public. The John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford performed an evaluation as part of their asymptomatic staff screening
service using the Respiratory Diagnostic Kit Evaluation (‘Red Kite’) study (Research Ethics Committee reference:
19/NW/0730; North West-Greater Manchester South Research Ethics Committee).

Statistical analyses
Fisher’s exact and chi-squared tests were used to determine non-random associations between categorical
variables. Statistical analyses and data visualisation were performed using R version 4.0.3. Sensitivity and
specificity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the exact Clopper-Pearson method.
