Abstract
The emergence and rapid rise in prevalence of three independent SARS-CoV-2 “501Y
lineages'', B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, in the last three months of 2020 has prompted
renewed concerns about the evolutionary capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to adapt to both
rising population immunity, and public health interventions such as vaccines and social
distancing. Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have, presumably under
intense natural selection following a shift in host environment, independently acquired
multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence all have gained
epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate the control of
COVID-19. Here, by examining patterns of mutations that arose in SARS-CoV-2
genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the selective
forces acting on immunologically important SARS-CoV-2 genes (such as N and S) that
likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition to involving
continuing sequence diversification, we find evidence that a significant portion of the
ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence
between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring how members
of these known 501Y lineages, and others still undiscovered, are convergently evolving
similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting infection and
vaccine induced host immune recognition.

Introduction
In the first eleven months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (December 2019 - October
2020), the evolution of the virus worldwide was in the context of a highly susceptible
new host population 1,2​
​ . Other than the early identification of the D614G substitution in
the viral spike protein 3–5
​ that probably increased its transmissibility without impacting its
pathogenesis, few mutations were epidemiologically significant and the evolutionary
dynamics of the virus was predominantly characterized by a mutational pattern of slow
and selectively-neutral random genetic drift. This behavior is consistent with exponential
growth in a population of naive susceptible hosts that do not exert significant selective
pressures on the pathogen prior to transmission events 2​​ . Past pandemics and
long-term evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses attest to the fact that such an
evolutionary “lull” does not necessarily last. Indeed, in late 2020, three relatively
divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages emerged in rapid succession: (i) B.1.1.7 or 501Y.V1
which will hereafter be referred to as V1 6​ (ii) B.1.351 or 501Y.V2 which will hereafter be
referred to as V2 7​​ and (iii) P.1 or 501Y.V3 which will hereafter be referred to as V3 8​​ .
Viruses in each of the three lineages (which will hereafter be collectively referred to as
501Y lineages) have multiple signature (or lineage defining) deletions and amino acid

changing substitutions (Figure 1), many of which impact key domains of the spike
protein: the primary target of both infection and vaccine induced immune responses.
Prior to this, while many distinct spike mutations had been observed, all circulating
SARS-CoV-2 lineages were defined by small numbers of mutations. All of the 501Y
lineages also have significantly altered phenotypes: increased human ACE2 receptor
affinity (V1, V2 and V3) 9–11​
​ , increased transmissibility (V1 and V2) 12–14​
​
, increased
capacity to overcome prior infection and/or vaccination-induced immunity (V2 and V3)
15–19
and associations with increased virulence (V1) 20​
​ . Why did the heavily mutated
501Y lineages all arise on different continents at almost the same time? Was this due to
an intrinsic property of SARS-CoV-2 and its mutability changing, or was it a shift in the
host selective environment extrinsic to the virus?
Evidence that natural selection has played a pivotal role in the emergence of V1, V2
and V3 can be found in the remarkable patterns of independently evolved convergent
mutations that have arisen within the members of these lineages (Figure 1). One of the
most striking of these parallel changes is a nine nucleotide deletion between genome
coordinates 11288 and 11296 (here and hereafter all nucleotide and amino acid
coordinates refer to the GenBank reference genome NC_045512). This deletion is
within the portion of ORF1ab that encodes non-structural protein 6 (nsp6): a component
of the SARS-CoV-2 membrane-tethered replication complex that likely influences the
formation and maturation of autophagosomes 21​
​ , and decreases the effectiveness of
host innate antiviral defences by reducing the responsiveness of infected cells to type I
interferons 22​
​ . Independently evolved deletions at this site have been repeatedly found
prior to the emergence of V1, V2 and V3 and it is also found with other V1 signature
deletion mutations in the newly reported SARS-CoV-2 lineage, B.1.525
(​https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/4​). Although the biological
consequences of the 11288 to 11296 deletion remain unknown, its convergent evolution
implies that, in the context of the B.1.525 and 501Y lineages at least, it is likely highly
adaptive.
Additionally, there are four convergent spike gene mutations that are each shared
between members of different 501Y lineages. Almost all the spike genes of sequences
in these lineages carry the N501Y mutation at a key receptor binding domain (RBD) site
that increases the affinity of the spike protein for human ACE2 receptors by ~3.5 fold
9,10​
. The vast majority of V2 and V3 variants and some more recent V1 variants also
have a spike E484K mutation. Whereas in the presence of 501N, 484K has a modest
positive impact on ACE2 binding 9​​ , when present with 501Y, these mutations together
synergistically increase ACE2-RBD binding affinity ~12.7 fold 10,11​
​
. Crucially, E484K and
other mutations at S/484 also frequently confer protection from neutralization by both
convalescent sera 23​
​ , vaccine elicited antibodies 17,24–26​
​
, and some monoclonal
antibodies 23,26​
​
. There is therefore increasing evidence that viruses carrying the E484K

we considered here to be signature mutations of V1, V2 and V3 sequences. Genes represented with
light blue blocks encode non-structural proteins and genes in orange encode structural proteins:S
encodes the spike protein, E the envelope protein, M the matrix protein, and N the nucleocapsid

A third RBD site that is mutated in both V2 and V3 is S/417. Whereas V2 sequences
generally carry a K417N mutation, V3 sequences carry a K417T mutation. Both the
K417N and K417T mutations can reduce the affinity of spike for ACE2, particularly in
conjunction with the 501Y and E484K mutations 24​

A fourth spike gene mutation that is shared by ~42% of V2 sequences and by all V3
sequences is L18F. This amino acid change is predicted to have a modest impact on
the structure of spike 28
​ and also protects from some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
29​
. Viruses carrying the L18F mutation have been detectably increasing in prevalence
since the start of the pandemic such that they now account for ~10% of sampled
SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
These five convergent mutations in different rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 lineages is
compelling evidence that they each, either alone or in combination, provide some
significant fitness advantage. The individual and collective fitness impacts of the other
signature mutations in V1, V2 and V3 remain unclear. A key way to infer the fitness
impacts of these mutations is to examine patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions at the codon sites where the mutations occurred 30​
​ . Specifically, it is
expected that the most biologically important of these mutations will have occurred at
codon sites that display substitution patterns that are dominated by non-synonymous
mutations (i.e. mutations that alter encoded amino acid sequences); patterns that are
indicative of positive selection.
Here, using a suite of phylogenetics-based natural selection analysis techniques, we
examine patterns of positive selection within the protein coding sequences of viruses in
the V1, V2 and V3 lineages to identify the mutations that have most likely contributed to
the increased adaptation of these lineages. We find that the emergence of the 501Y
lineages coincided with a marked global change in positive selection signals, indicative
of a general shift in the selective environment within which SARS-CoV-2 is evolving.
Against this backdrop the 501Y lineages all display evidence of substantial ongoing
adaptation that in many cases involves mutations that converge on the signature
mutations of other 501Y lineages, but also involve multiple other convergent mutations
at non-signature sites: a pattern which suggests both that viruses in all three lineages
may be climbing very similar adaptive peaks, and, therefore, that viruses in all three
lineages are likely in the process of converging on a similar adaptive endpoint.

Results and Discussion
There has been a recent detectable shift in selective pressures acting on
circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants
Analyses of positive selection on SARS-CoV-2 genomes undertaken prior to the
emergence of 501Y lineages revealed mutational patterns dominated by neutral
evolution 2​​ . There were, however, indications that some sites in the genome had
experienced episodes of positive selection 3–5​
​ . Through regular analyses of global
GISAID data (30), starting in March 2020, we tracked the extent and location of positive

and negative selective pressures on SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Figure 2). The power of
these analyses to detect evidence of selection acting on individual codon sites
progressively increased throughout 2020 with increasing numbers of sampled genome
sequences and sequence diversification.
Even accounting for this expected increased power of detection, it is evident that a
significant shift in selective pressures occurred ~11 months after SARS-CoV-2 cases
were first reported in Wuhan City in December 2019. Specifically, during November
2020 this change in selection pressures manifested in substantial increases in the
numbers of SARS-CoV-2 codon sites that were detectably evolving under both positive
and negative selection. This increase accelerated through January 2021, with sites
found to be evolving under diversifying positive selection in S, N, and ORF3a (MEME​31
or FEL 30
​ selection detection method p ≤ 0.0001) rapidly increasing in density from a
baseline of between zero and four codons per Kb in November 2020, to 10 or more
codons per Kb at the beginning of 2021 (Figure 2A). This sudden increase in the
numbers of sites that were detectably evolving under positive selection coincided with
epidemic surges in multiple parts of the world in both hemispheres, many of which were
driven by the emerging V1 and V2 lineages.
Among the 37 signature mutation sites in V1, V2 and V3 (Figure 1), 14 were detectably
evolving under positive selection prior to December 2020 whereas this number
increased to 31 by January 2021 (Figure 2C). The only signature mutation shared
between any of the three 501Y lineages that was detectably evolving under positive
selection before December 2020 was S/18 which was weakly detected for the first time
in October.
Our regular tracking of positively selected SARS-CoV-2 codon sites prior to November
2020 therefore yielded no clear indications that non-synonymous substitutions at the
crucial RBD sites S/417, S/484 or S/501 (the other key convergent signature mutation
sites in the 501Y lineages), provided SARS-CoV-2 with any substantial fitness
advantages in the first 11 months of the pandemic. Instead, the sporadic weak selection
signals that these analyses yielded between July and November were of adaptive
amino acid substitutions in the Spike N-terminal domain (S/18, and the V3 signature
site, S/26), near the furin cleavage site (the V3 signature site, S/655), and in the
C-terminal domain (the V3 signature site, S/1027, and the V1 signature site, S/1118).
Conversely, for much of the latter half of 2020 the relatively strong and consistently
detected selection signals at the V1 signature site, N/3, and the V2 signature sites,
ORF1ab/265 (nsp2 codon 85) and ORF3a/57, clearly indicated that some substitutions
at these sites were likely adaptations.

Signals of ongoing selection within the V1, V2 and V3 lineages
We collected all sequences assigned to B.1.1.7 (V1), B.1.351 (V2), and P1 (V3)
PANGO lineages 32
​ in GISAID 33
​ as of Feb 02, 2021, and subjected them to a
comprehensive battery of gene- and codon-level selection tests (see Methods).
We first tested the 501Y lineage sequences to determine whether, at the level of
individual genes, they were evolving under measurably different selective pressures
than other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. To each of the individual V1, V2, and V3 gene
datasets we added algorithmically-selected (see Methods) non-501Y lineage reference
sequences that were representative of historical SARS-CoV-2 diversity (sampled prior
to Oct 15th, 2020). We then analysed each of these datasets to compare the selective
processes operating on the reference sequences relative to the V1, V2 and V3 lineage
sequences since their emergence. The relative lack of sequence divergence in the
analysed datasets meant that the power of these gene-wide analyses was expected to
be low, especially for V3 for which few sequences were available. However, among the
genes with sufficient clade-level phylogenetic resolution, using the BUSTED[S] selection
detection method 31
​ we found evidence of episodic diversifying selection in the N-gene
(all clades), nsp3 (V1/V2), S (V3), and RdRp, endornase, exonuclease, ORF7 and
ORF8 in V1. It should be noted though that the gene-wide signal of positive selection
detected in the V1 ORF8 is likely a consequence of a mutation that introduced a stop
codon into this ORF at position 27.
We next examined the different lineage-specific datasets with background references
for evidence of positive selection at individual codon sites using MEME 34
​ and IFEL 35​
​ .
These analyses revealed evidence of positive selection at 111 individual codon sites
across all lineages including 43 in V1, 64 in V2, and 14 in V3 (Table S1;
https://observablehq.com/@spond/combined-view-of-sites-under-selection-in-n501y-cla
des​). This is indicative of substantial ongoing adaptation of V1 and V2 sequences since
the emergence of these lineages. V3 sequences might also be adaptively evolving but
there is too little sequence data currently available to convincingly detect selection at
individual codon sites in this lineage .
Differentiating between convergent mutations and recombination
Given that five of the signature mutations found in the V1, V2 and V3 lineages are
convergent, it is worth considering how, mechanistically, these mutations were brought
together in the progenitors of these lineages. While independent mutations in two viral
genomes at the same codon site could both yield the same amino acid change, this
same result could also be achieved if only one genome acquired the mutation, and then
embedded in a stretch of homologous sequence it was swapped into the other genome

by genetic recombination in a co-infected individual. Two coronavirus genomes
replicating within the same cell will frequently exchange fragments of their genetic code
36
and there are tentative reports that recombination may be detectable both within the
global SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset 37​
​ , and specifically within the V1 and V2 lineages
38​
. Although it is certain that SARS-CoV-2 is recombining, it is extremely difficult to
differentiate between convergent mutations and actual recombination events when
recombination is occurring between highly similar sequences 39​
​ . Regardless, it is very
unlikely that any of the presently detectable convergent 501Y lineage mutations were
derived through recombination between viruses in the different 501Y lineages because
until January 2021 the lineages were geographically separated. It is nevertheless
possible that independent convergent mutations seen in different sub-lineages of V1, V2
and V3 sequences might in reality be the consequence of either intra-lineage
recombinational transfers of the mutations between genetically distinct sequences
within the lineages, or transfers from co-circulating non-501Y lineage viruses. In either
case, just as convergent mutation events are effectively indistinguishable from
recombination events, so too are the practical implications of convergent mutations and
recombination. Since we detected no convincing evidence of recombination in any of
the datasets that we analysed here, we will hereafter refer exclusively to convergent
mutations even though in reality some of the mutations in question could have
conceivably been acquired through recombination. With the emergence of more
divergent lineages such as V1, V2 and V3, it is likely that recombination will be both
more readily detectable as these begin to co-circulate, and more likely to generate
increasingly diverse variants.
Signals of ongoing mutational convergence at signature mutation sites
Notable among the lineage-specific positive selection signals detected at 111 individual
codon sites of 501Y lineage sequences, were those detected at 21 of their signature
mutation sites: 6/11 of the V1 signature sites, 8/14 of the V2 ones and 12/17 of the V3
ones (see underlined codon site numbers in Figure 1). Given that (i) each lineage was
defined by the signature mutations along the phylogenetic tree branch basal to its clade,
and (ii) that these basal branches were included in the lineage-specific selection
analyses, these selection analysis results were biased in favour of detecting the
signature mutations as evolving under positive selection. We therefore used the
selection results for signature mutation sites only to identify the signature mutations
that, relative to the background reference sequences, were evolving under the strongest
degrees of positive selection.
Most noteworthy of the signature mutation sites that displayed the strongest evidence of
lineage-specific positive selection are codons S/18, S/80, S/417, S/484, S/501, and

S/701 in that all are either suspected or known to harbour mutations with potentially
significant fitness impacts 9,10,23,25,26,29,40​
​
.
There are particularly interesting ongoing mutational dynamics at codons S/18 and
S/484 in the V1 lineage. Although neither of these codons are signature mutation sites
in the V1 lineage, in multiple independent instances mutations have occurred at these
sites that converge on signature mutations seen in the V2 and V3 lineages.
Whereas the L18F mutation is fixed in all currently sampled V3 lineage sequences, it
has occurred (and persisted in descendent variants) at least twice in the V1 lineage and
at least four times in the V2 lineage. S/18 falls within multiple different predicted CTL
epitopes 41
​ and the L18F mutation is known to reduce viral sensitivity to some
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 29​
​ . An F at residue S/18 is also observed in 10% of
other known Sarbecoviruses and the L18F mutation is the tenth most common in
currently sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Having occurred independently numerous
times since the start of the pandemic, S/18 is also detectably evolving under positive
selection in the global SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset (MEME p-value = 6.9 x 10​-13​).
More concerning than these convergent L18F mutations are the convergent E484K
mutations that have independently arisen at least twice within the V1 lineage and are
arising independently elsewhere and persisting in descendent variants. These
mutations converge on a significant signature mutation found in the V2 and V3 lineages
that decreases viral sensitivity to both infection- and vaccine-induced neutralizing
antibodies 17,24–26,40
​
and, in conjunction with the N501Y mutation, increases the affinity of
Spike for human ACE2 receptor sites 10,11​
​
.
Similar convergence patterns to those observed at S/18 and S/484 can be seen at
seven other signature mutation sites: S/26, S/681, S/701, S/716, S/1176, and N/80. Of
these S/681, S/701, and S/716 fall within 30 residues of the biologically important furin
cleavage site (S/680 to S/689). Whereas some V2 sequences have independently
acquired the signature V1 mutations, P681H and T716I, some V1 sequences have
independently acquired the V2 signature mutation, A701V. Any of these three mutations
might directly impact the priming of spike for ACE2 binding and, consequently, the
efficiency of viral entry into host cells 42​
​ . SARS-CoV-2 variants with deletions of the furin
cleavage site have reduced pathogenicity 43,44
​
and, although presently untested, it is
plausible that the P681H mutation - which falls within this site - might increase the
efficiency of furin cleavage by replacing a less favourable uncharged amino acid with a
more favourable positively charged basic one 42​
​ . Whereas S/716 is not detectably under
selection in either the lineage-specific or global SARS-CoV-2 datasets, sites S/681 and
S/701 are both detectably evolving under positive selection in the global SARS-CoV-2

that are consistent with the P681H and A701V mutations being adaptive.
Non-convergent mutations at signature mutation sites might still be evolutionarily
convergent
In addition to the ten positively selected signature mutation sites displaying evidence of
convergent mutations between the V1, V2 and V3 lineages, five positively selected
signature mutation sites (S/20, S/80, S/138, S/190 and S/215) display evidence of only
divergent mutations (at the amino acid replacement level), where the same site is
mutated as in another lineage, but to a different amino acid. All five of these codon sites
are detectably evolving under positive selection in both individual lineage specific
datasets and, with the exception of S/190, the global SARS-CoV-2 dataset (Figure 3).
The diverging mutations at these five sites might in fact also be contributing to the
overall patterns of evolutionary convergence between the lineages; just via different
routes. The N-terminal domain of spike where all five of these sites fall, (and S/80 in
particular) is targeted by some monoclonal and infection-induced neutralizing antibodies
29
and it is therefore possible that these sites could be evolving under immunity-driven
diversifying selective pressures. Therefore while mutations at S/20, S/80, S/138, S/190
and S/215 in different lineages do not converge on the same encoded amino acid
states, they could nevertheless still be convergent on similar fitness objectives (immune
escape or compensation for the fitness costs of other mutations): such as is likely the
case with the also not-strictly-convergent V2 K417N and V3 K417T signature mutations.
Positive selection may be driving further convergence at non-signature mutation
sites
In addition to lineage-specific signals of positive selection being detected at 21 of the
signature mutation sites that characterize each of V1, V2 and V3 (Figure 1), such
signals were also detected at 90 non-signature mutation sites Table S1). To test
whether positive selection acting at these codon sites might be favouring convergent
amino acid changes across the three lineages we examined each of the 90
non-signature mutation sites that were detectably evolving under positive selection in
any one of the lineages for evidence of convergent mutations having occurred in either
of the other two lineages. This revealed the occurrence of convergent mutations
between sequences in different lineages at 26/90 (28.9%) of these sites including
eleven in ORF1a and twelve in the S-gene (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Genome sites where signature and convergent mutations occur within the V1, V2 and V3
lineage sequences. Labels within the coloured blocks indicate amino acid substitutions occurring at
individual sites whereas the colours of the blocks indicate model-based predictions of the probable
evolutionary viability of the observed amino acid substitutions based on the numbers of times these
substitutions have been observed in related coronaviruses that infect other host species. The absence
of colour indicates unprecedented substitutions, red indicates highly unusual substitutions and green
indicates common substitutions seen at homologous sites in non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses.

Most notable among the mutations occurring at these non-signature sites are spike L5F
mutations seen in V1 and V2 lineages. S/5 has been detectably evolving under positive
selection in the global SARS-CoV-2 dataset since May 2020 (MEME p-value = 1.6 x
10​-16​) 3​ and in both the V1 (p=0.08, marginal evidence) and V2 lineages (p=0.001). L5F
mutations have arisen independently at least eight times in the V1 lineage and at least
twice in the V2 lineage. The precise biological significance of the L5F mutation remains
unknown but it falls within CTL epitopes that are predicted to be recognizable by a
broad array of different HLA types (Campbell et al., 2020) and is therefore potentially a
CTL escape mutation.
Collectively, convergent amino acid changes in individual clades of the V1 or V2
lineages respectively account for 17/236 (7.2%) and 16/103 (15.5%) of all the
non-synonymous mutations mapping to internal branches of these clades. Conditioned
on observed variability in the sequences, there are 50 polymorphic amino-acid sites
shared by the two clades; the probability that 16 of those 50 will be convergent between
two clades by chance alone is ≤ 10​-6​ (permutation test).
All 26 genome sites where convergent mutations occur are detectably evolving under
positive selection in at least one of the V1, V2 or V3 lineages. Further, 20/26 of the
codons where these convergent non-signature site mutations occur are also inferred to
be evolving under either pervasive or episodic positive selection in the global
SARS-CoV-2 dataset (MEME p-values < 0.05). Collectively this is strong evidence that
an appreciable proportion of the convergent non-signature site mutations are adaptive.
Coevolution of spike codons hint at the enabling role of the N501Y mutation
In an effort to better understand the selective processes that might have driven, and
might still be driving, the adaptive convergence of mutations in V1, V2 and V3 we
separately examined patterns of amino acid substitution within each of the three
lineages for evidence of different amino acid sites coevolving with one another. It is
plausible that, as has been observed in other rapidly evolving viruses 45,46​
​
, adaptive
mutations in particular genes of V1, V2 and V3 lineage viruses might have had an

associated fitness cost that was subsequently recouped by a secondary compensatory
mutation elsewhere in those genes (a process called antagonistic epistasis).
Alternatively, two or more individual mutations that in previous phases of the epidemic
may have appeared to have little or no adaptive value when found alone, might
synergise when occurring together within the V1, V2 and/or V3 viruses to yield
substantial fitness benefits (called synergistic epistasis). Codon pairs with these
antagonistic (dampening) and synergistic (enhancing) epistatic interactions might be
expected to co-evolve to some degree. We attempted to test for such coevolving codon
pairs using a Bayesian graphical model 45
​ approach which infers networks of conditional
dependence relationships among codon sites.
Although the power of this test was expected to be severely limited by the low degrees
of genetic diversity in the V1, V2 and V3 datasets, it nevertheless succeeded in
identifying sets of somewhat concordant co-varying residues in the V1 and V2 datasets.
In V2, we found three-way coevolutionary interactions between positions S/417, S/501
and S/701​. ​If this apparent epistasis is antagonistic then, given the centrality of S/501 in
the emergence of the V1, V2 and V3 lineages, it is likely that N501Y was a primary
adaptive mutation with the other two being compensatory for whatever fitness costs
were associated with a Y residue at S/501. S/417 sits ~20 Å away from S/501 in the
spike 3D structure (Figure 4) and might conceivably compensate for some
less-than-optimal structural impact of the N501Y mutation. Given that both sites are
within the ACE2 receptor binding motif, mutations at ​S/501 might also interact either
antagonistically or synergistically with S/417 to optimize ACE2 binding affinity (as is
suggested in 11
​ for this particular site pair) and/or maximize neutralization escape.
Similarly, S/701 which sits ~102 Å from S/501 near the furin cleavage site ​and therefore
potentially impacts furin-mediated priming of the spike protein for ACE2 binding, ​might
synergistically interact with S/501​ to expedite cellular entry.
Three two-way coevolutionary interactions were also detected in the S-gene of V1
lineage viruses. As with the V2 coevolutionary interactions these include pairs of sites
in/near the RBD (S/366 and S/575 which are ~29 Å apart, and S/479 with S/490 which
are ~14 Å apart) that are close enough in the 3D structure that one site might
epistatically interact with the other with respect to ACE2 binding and/or neutralization
escape. The detected coevolutionary interactions in the V1 spike also include a pair of
sites where one, S/560, is near the RBD in the 3D structure and the other, S/716, is ~81
Å away near the furin cleavage site such that they too may be coevolving to optimize
cellular entry.
While the clustering of coevolving sites in the RBDs of V1 and V2 lineage viruses
suggests that mutations in this region might commonly involve fitness trade-offs

between ACE2 binding affinity and neutralization susceptibility, we must caution against
over-interpreting these results. Given the small numbers of mutations informing these
coevolution analyses, the inferred epistatic interactions are best viewed as speculative.

What might have caused the sudden emergence of the 501Y lineages​?
The sedentary pace of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the first eleven months of the
pandemic implies that, with the probable exception of the spike D614G mutation 3​​ ,
almost none of the arising mutations during that time conferred any substantial fitness
advantage. What this means is that from the start of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was
likely near a fitness peak with respect to its capacity to infect and transmit between
humans 2,48​
​ . This could explain why, with the exception of the spike L18F mutation,
neither the key convergent signature mutations in V1, V2 and V3, nor the additional
convergent mutations that we report here rose substantially in frequency in the global
SARS-CoV-2 population before October 2020. Given the numbers of infections that had
occurred by October, all of these individual mutations, and even all of the potentially
epistatically interacting pairs of these mutations, would have arisen independently

multiple times in different infected individuals without providing the viruses within which
they occurred a detectable fitness advantage.
The fitness advantages of viruses that led to the V1, V2 and V3 clades may have only
manifested after October 2020 because the fitness landscape upon which SARS-CoV-2
had been evolving up until then underwent a topographical change that opened up new
mutational pathways to increased fitness. Our discovery here of a major selective shift
in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants sampled before and after November 2020
appears to support the possibility of a sudden global SARS-CoV-2 fitness landscape
change in approximately October 2020. The precise cause of this selective shift is
unknown but increases in seropositivity and/or the relaxation of transmission prevention
measures are obvious candidates.
However, the apparent sudden emergence of the 501Y lineages might not have
required selective shifts and a changed or changing global fitness landscape. The
emergence of these lineages could have been enabled by mutational jumps across a
static global fitness landscape if such a landscape included the possibility of viruses
being transmitted late during the course of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections 6​​ . Such
long-term infections are relatively common but mostly involve dead-end viral shedding
into the digestive tract 49​
​ . Occasionally, particularly in the context of
immune-compromised patients 50,51​
​
, these long-term infections also involve chronic
upper respiratory tract infections with transmissible virus shedding. The local
SARS-CoV-2 fitness landscapes within chronically-infected patients may be either
softened, or shifted: perhaps because the main selective pressures within these
patients are immunity evasion instead of transmission. By allowing the accumulation of
larger combinations of epistatically interacting mutations and facilitating better
exploration of local fitness landscapes within individual patients, chronic infections could
have enabled the serendipitous discovery of new peaks on the global fitness landscape;
i.e., adaptations to a single individual enhancing characteristics such as transmissibility
and
population-scale
immune
evasion.
The
credibility
of
this
“chronic-illness-emergence-hypothesis” is strengthened by the fact that SARS-CoV-2
variants with notable similarities to viruses in the 501Y lineages have been
independently observed in chronically infected patients. Besides carrying N501Y and
E484K mutations, some of these viruses have also carried the spike N-terminal domain
deletions seen in V1 sequences 50,51​
​
.
The chronic-illness-emergence-hypothesis hypothesis is also appealing because it
explains both the high degree of divergence of the 501Y lineage viruses relative to their
nearest ancestors, and the timing of their emergence. The apparent absence of
substantial SARS-CoV-2 adaptations during the early pandemic would simply be a
consequence of the durations of the chronic infections within which the progenitors of

these lineages evolved. Chronic infections lasting between three and five months have
been well documented 50–53​
​
. Chronic infections that occurred in April 2020 when the first
global peak of infections occurred might be expected to only yield substantially adapted
variants by July or August 2020 which is approximately concordant with estimates of the
times when the most recent common ancestors of viruses in the V2 lineage arose 7​​ .
Factoring in the time it would have taken for prototypes of these 501Y lineages to
spread sufficiently from the index cases, their detection and characterization in the last
three months of 2020 may have in fact been the expected outcome of chronic infections
that started in April. Such outcomes could perhaps have even been predictable given
the mounting selection pressures exerted by increasing population immunity in the latter
half of 2020.
What patterns of selection, convergence and coevolution tell us about the
adaptive value of 501Y lineage mutations
Although it is clear that in the regions of the world where the 501Y lineage viruses are
expanding in prevalence these viruses have substantial fitness advantages over the
SARS-CoV-2 variants that preceded them, it remains unclear what the precise
biological underpinnings of these advantages are.
One possibility is that viruses in the 501Y lineages might be better at infecting people
who have been previously infected. The convergent spike mutations in codons S/18,
S/80, S/417, S/484, and S/501 all provide some degree of protection from known
anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies 25,29,40​
​
. The places in the world where V2 and
V3 seem to have first emerged have high to medium density population centres (Nelson
Mandela Bay and Manaus respectively) that had large numbers of people who had
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in October 2020; the time when it is assumed that these
lineages began exponentially expanding 14,54​
​
. Further, viruses in both lineages seem
highly resistant to neutralization by the sera of previously infected individuals 15–17​
​
.
While this “evasion-of-preexisting-immunity” hypothesis might explain fitness
advantages of the V2 and V3 lineage viruses, it does not convincingly explain the
fitness advantage of V1 lineage viruses. Modelling of the spread of V1 in the UK
suggested a much better fit under transmissibility advantages, than immunity evasion 20​
​ .
Additionally, very few of the signature V1 S-gene mutations are known to have any
strong impact on antibody binding 17​
​ ,​40​. The deletion of codon S/144 in the N-terminal
domain of Spike in these sequences appears to be strongly protective against some
monoclonal antibodies 26,29
​
and the S982A mutation that they carry can be slightly
protective against some Pfizer and Moderna vaccine induced antibodies 49​
​ .
Nevertheless, only very modest reductions have been observed in the ​capacity of
polyclonal sera from vaccinated individuals to neutralize ​V1 pseudotyped viruses​,

suggesting that V1 ​likely has limited immune escape adaptations 24,25,55,56​
​
. Furthermore,
V1, V2 and V3 signature mutations (including N501Y) were overrepresented in ​in vitro
experimental evolution lines not exposed to any active immunity, suggesting that many
of the apparent immune-evasion signature mutations in all of these lineages might
contribute to increased R0 irrespective of their immune evasion properties 57​
​ .
Even if immune selection was not a primary contributor to the emergence of V1, recent
reports on the discovery of V1 sequences carrying the signature V2 and V3 spike
mutation, E484K 58​
​ , together with our discovery here in V1 sequences of spike
N-terminal domain mutations (such as L5F, L18F, P26S, A27S, and A222V) at codon
sites that are both detectably evolving under positive selection and also converge on
mutations seen in V2 and V3 sequences, suggests that immune pressure is at present
likely impacting the ongoing evolution of the V1 lineage.
Besides immune evasion, other plausible contributors to the fitness advantage of
viruses in the 501Y lineages are: (1) that they produce more particles at anatomical
sites suitable for optimal droplet or aerosol transmission, (2) that they produce particles
that individually have physical properties that increase their survivability during
transmission, or (3) that they have molecular features that make them better at entering
human cells. V1 infections have been associated with increased viral loads at the
nasopharynx 32
​ which suggests that increased transmissibility may simply be a
consequence of increased numbers of viral particles per exhaled infectious droplet.
There is, however, conflicting data on this point with some indications that V1 infections
might not in fact be associated with higher viral loads 59,60​
​
. Currently there is no available
data on how well the V1, V2 and V3 lineage viruses survive in the environment relative
to those of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
What is known with a high degree of confidence, however, is that the N501Y mutation
that is shared by V1, V2 and V3 viruses increases the affinity of spike for human ACE2
receptors 9​​ , that this affinity is synergistically enhanced by the E484K mutations found in
V2 and V3 viruses 10,11​
​
, and that these mutations therefore likely increase the probability
that contacts between virus particles and human cells will result in successful infections.
Crucially, increased ACE2 binding affinity could by itself also contribute to the evasion
of pre-existing immunity. Besides favouring ACE2 in competitions with neutralizing
antibodies for spike protein binding sites, increased ACE2 binding affinities might
shorten the time needed for viruses to enter cells and, therefore, shrink the window of
their vulnerability to antibodies.
The time required for bound viruses to enter cells could also be reduced in V1 and V2
viruses by optimized furin-mediated priming of spike for ACE2 binding. Although V1, V2
and V3 viruses all carry spike mutations that might impact this process (P681H and

T716I in V1, S701V in V2, and H655Y in V3 42​
​ , it is presently unknown whether any of
them actually do. Here we detect both convergence in some V2 sequences on the V1
P681H and T716I ​signature mutations, and convergence in V1 sequences on the V2
signature mutation, A701V​. The convergence of mutations at these sites, two of which
are also detectably evolving under positive selection in the global SARS-CoV-2 dataset,
suggests that selection in the V1 and V2 lineages may be favoruring further optimization
of spike priming for ACE2 receptor binding.
The interplay between selection favouring optimization of furin-mediated spike priming,
ACE2 binding, and escape from RBD targeting antibodies is perhaps evident in the
weak signals of coevolution that we detect in V1 and V2 sequences between pairs of S
gene codons within the RBD (such as S/479 and S/490 in V1 and S/501 and S/417 in
V2) and sites in the RBD with sites close to the furin cleavage site (such as S/570 and
S/716 in V1 and
S/501 and S/701 in V2). These coevolution patterns and
experimentally demonstrated synergism between N501Y and E484K mutations 10
​
collectively suggest that constellations of mutations in the 501Y lineages may have
initially coalesced around a set of synergistic epistatic interactions between N501Y, an
ACE2 binding optimization mutation, furin-mediate spike priming optimization mutations
(potentially P681H, A701V, and T716I), and immune evasion mutations in the RBD
(such as E484K, K417N and K417T).
Epistasis could also explain why SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying N501Y mutations are
only now starting to dominate the pandemic. The increase in ACE2 binding affinity and
modest protection from some neutralizing antibodies that are provided by N501Y, even
in the absence of changes at other sites 9,40​
​ , likely fostered the continual low-but-stable
prevalence of this mutation globally. If S/501Y does indeed have a propensity to
epistatically interact with, and realize the adaptive benefits of, multiple different
mutations impacting ACE2 binding, spike priming, cell entry and/or immune evasion,
then this could explain its centrality during the coalescence of the V1, V2 and V3
signature mutation constellations.
Where is the evolution of the 501Y lineages headed?
Regardless of specific details of how or why the V1, V2 and V3 lineages evolved, it is
apparent that the evolution of viruses within these lineages is continuing and that much
of this evolution is adaptive, involving both sequence diversification and further
mutational convergence between viruses in the different lineages. We can speculate
based on our selection analyses, the convergence patterns that we detect, and model
based predictions of codons expected to be found is SARS-CoV-2 based on the
evolution
of
related
coronaviruses
in
other
host
species
(​http://hyphy.org/w/index.php/PRIME​), that the culmination of this current stage of

convergence might be a virus containing a subset of codons expressing 350I, 519S,
911F, 944L, 1220L, 1612L, 2087I, 2488F, 2648I, 2799F and 3718F in ORF1a; 454I and
3548F in ORF1b; 5F, 18F, 21T, 26S, 27S, 215Y/G/H, 222V, 417N/T, 484K, 501Y,
583D, 622F, 653V, 681H, 701V, 716I, 812S, 892V, 1020S, 1176F, and 1219V in the
S-gene; 131C in ORF3a; and 24I, 80L/R, 145Y, and 365L/S in the N-gene.
The most important issue here is not whether this particular “super variant” ever arises,
but rather that the convergent mutations that have already arisen in members of the
different 501Y lineages implies that these viruses are presently on, and are actively
scaling, a broad new peak in the fitness landscape. Whatever SARS-CoV-2 variants
eventually summit that peak could be a considerably bigger problem for us than any
variants that we currently know in that they might have any combinations of increased
transmissibility, altered virulence and/or increased capacity to escape population
immunity.
Although only time can test the accuracy of this prediction, it should be possible using in
vitro evolution to infer some amino acid sequence features at the adaptive summit of
this fitness peak. An obvious approach would be to use replicated, laboratory infections
of either synthesised or sampled live viruses carrying complements of mutations that
are representative of the current standing diversity within the V1, V2 and V3 lineages. In
the presence of mixed sera from multiple previously infected and/or vaccinated
individuals these infections would create the appropriate conditions both for genetic
recombination
to
occur,
and
for selection to rapidly sort multiple
recombination-generated combinations of input immune evasion, cell entry and
replication impacting mutations. Although the chimaeras that ultimately dominate these
in vitro infections will doubtlessly be cell-culture optimized (as opposed to transmission
between, and replication within, humans optimized) they should nevertheless carry
many combinations of mutations that will be relevant to the continuing pandemic and
which should include some of the most concerning mutation combinations that might
arise during 2021: perhaps particularly so when/if some of these 501Y lineage viruses
start naturally recombining with each other. Even if the concerning combinations that
are discovered are only triplets or quartets of mutations, these would still be invaluable
hints at what we should start looking for when it comes to trawling the rapidly growing
pool of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data for potential vaccine escape mutants
and other potentially problematic variants of concern.

Because the codon-based selection analyses that we performed gain no power from
including identical sequences, and minimal power from including sequences that are
essentially identical, we filtered V1, V2, V3, and reference (GISAID) sequences using
pairwise genetic distances complete linkage clustering with the tn93-cluster tool
(​https://github.com/veg/tn93​). All groups of sequences that are within ​D ​genetic distance
(Tamura-Nei 93) of ​every other sequence in the group and represented by a single
(randomly chosen) sequence in the group. We set ​D at ​0.0001 for ​lineage-specific
sequence sets, and at ​0.0015 for GISAID reference (or “background”) sequence sets.
We restricted the reference set of sequences to those sampled before Oct 15th, 2020.
We inferred a maximum likelihood tree from the combined sequence dataset using

internal branches in the resulting tree into two non-overlapping sets used for testing
(e.g., orange and blue branches in Figure 5) ​and annotated the Newick tree. Because of
lack of phylogenetic resolution in some of the segments/genes, not all analyses were
possible for all segments/genes. In particular this is true when lineage V1, V2 or V3
sequences were not monophyletic in a specific region, and no internal branches could
be labeled as belonging to the focal lineage.
