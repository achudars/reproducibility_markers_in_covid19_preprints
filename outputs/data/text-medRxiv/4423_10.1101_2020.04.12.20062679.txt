Summary

21

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of COVID-19. Most of SARS-CoV-2 carriers are assumed to exhibit

22

no or mild non-specific symptoms. Thus, they may contribute to the rapid and mostly silent

23

circulation of the virus among humans. Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples it has

24

recently been proposed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters (WW) as a complementary tool to

25

investigate virus circulation in human populations. In the present work we assumed that the

26

quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters should correlate with the number of

27

symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers. To test this hypothesis, we performed a time-course

28

quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in raw wastewater samples collected from several

29

major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of the Parisian area. The study was conducted from 5

30

March to 23 April 2020, therefore including the lockdown period in France (since 17 March 2020).

31

We confirmed that the increase of genome units in raw wastewaters accurately followed the

32

increase of human COVID-19 cases observed at the regional level. Of note, the viral genomes could

33

be detected before the beginning of the exponential growth of the epidemic. As importantly, a

34

marked decrease in the quantities of genomes units was observed concomitantly with the reduction

35

in the number of new COVID-19 cases which was an expected consequence of the lockdown. As a

36

conclusion, this work suggests that a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewaters

37

should bring important and additional information for an improved survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation

38

at the local or regional scale.

Introduction

41

SARS-Cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family and the etiologic

42

agent of COVID-19, a globalized infection affecting more than 2.5 million people worldwide and

43

causing more than 180 000 deaths in total, including more than 160 000 cases in France on April 22,

44

2020. Virus transmission is mainly associated with the projection of respiratory droplets although a

45

possible contamination through aerosols, contaminated hands and inert surfaces is likely. SARS-Cov-

46

2 causes severe complications mostly in elderly or people suffering from comorbidity factors (such as

47

diabetes, hypertension, obesity, acquired or iatrogenic immunosuppression).

48

The viral infection may initiate in the upper respiratory and/or the lower respiratory tracts. Similarly

49

to SARS-CoV-1 (1) and MERS-CoV (2), SARS-CoV-2 genome was also detected in blood and stools (3–

50

5). This argue for a possible enteric phase of the infection although isolation of infectious virus from

51

feces seems difficult (6). Of note diarrhea have been reported in some cases of COVID-19 (6).

52

Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be detected in feces several weeks after it could not be

53

detected anymore in oral swabs, suggesting that viral excretion in tools may be longer than oral

54

secretion (7). The presence of viral genomes in stools may open new perspective in the survey of

55

SARS-CoV-2 carriers. It would notably suggest that the virus could possibly be transmitted by a feco-

56

oral route, an hypothesis that should likely deserve a careful examination (8) .

57

Management of an epidemic, such as lockdown decision, requires a careful monitoring of the

58

infected population by detecting the virus in carriers through massive or targeted testing.

59

Investigating the proportion of people that have been infected through sero-epidemiological surveys

60

is equally important but antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will appear only weeks after initial infection

61

(9,10). In the case of COVID-19, due to the lack of systematic and repeated screening of the

62

population, the precise number of infected people is difficult to assess, especially because of the high

63

proportion of infected people that exhibit only few or no symptoms but could secrete and silently

64

transmit the virus (11–14). Depending on screening kit availability and public health policy, testing

65

strategy varies between countries which may explain some discrepancy between worldwide data.

66

Estimating the effective proportion of infected individuals is essential for monitoring the epidemic

67

spread and to propose adapted and efficient control procedures, such as partial or total lockdown.

68

France went into lockdown on the March 17 2020, a decision that was expected to have a major

69

impact on virus circulation especially when asymptomatic carriers are considered to have a strong

70

impact on virus transmission. This decision was motivated by the urgent need to limit exposure of so-

71

called fragile people who are at highest risk to develop the most severe forms of the disease

72

(11,13,15).

73

Analysis of raw wastewaters collected at the inlet of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) may

74

provide essential information on the health of the human population that is connected to the WWTP.

75

It may notably allow measurement and identification of pathogens or drugs that may be difficult to

76

assess otherwise. Using this method, the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction

77

follows drugs and their metabolites in the wastewater of several European cities (16). In addition

78

previous works on human enteric viruses in urban river and in raw and treated wastewaters

79

demonstrated that the presence of these viruses was directly linked to epidemic state in the

80

population (17,18). This strongly argue for a close monitoring of fecal viruses in wastewater as a new

81

and complementary tool for investigating human epidemics.

82

Enveloped viruses like coronaviruses are expected to be less resistant than naked viruses that are

83

usually tracked in waste and environmental waters. There is still little information on the persistence

84

of coronaviruses in waters and most of our current knowledge has been inferred from experiments

85

made on surrogate viruses. Recent data suggested that infectious SARS-CoV-2 is particularly resistant

86

in environmental conditions: 3.5 half-life days in the air, 7 days on some surfaces, any reduction at

87

pH between 3 and 10 (6,19). Previous studies on SARS-CoV-1 indicated a significant persistence at 4

88

°C even in wastewater (more than 20 days), or a persistence of at least 1 or 2 days at summer

89

temperatures (1,20,21).

90

Altogether these results led us and others to suggest that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in

91

wastewater could provide an early and global tool to monitor virus circulation in addition to human

92

epidemiological data (22–24).

93

A first publication underlined the putative benefit of a qualitative approach for monitoring SARS-CoV-

94

2 in wastewaters (24). Other studies used quantitative measurements of viral genomes but the

95

survey only started at the apex of the epidemic (25). Here, we used a specific reverse-transcription

96

quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method to precisely quantify SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents in raw

97

wastewaters of the Parisian area. A 2-months survey covering the lockdown period allowed to

98

observe an increase and a decrease in the total quantities of viral genomes that paralleled the

99

number of new COVID-19 cases in the same region. To our knowledge, this is the first real-time

100
101

indirect survey of SARS-CoV-2 circulation during a lockdown period.

102

Methods

103

Sample collection

104

Three WWTP (more than 100 000 inhabitants linked to the station from the Parisian area were

105

sampled since the start of the epidemic (March 5th, 2020). Samples were kept at 4°C and processed

106

less than 24 hours after sampling.

107

Concentration methods

108

Samples were homogenized, then 11 ml were centrifugated at 200 000 x g for 1 hour at +4°C. Viral

109

pellets were resuspended in 400 μL of PBS 1X buffer.

110

200µL of viral concentrate were lysed and extracted using PowerFecal Pro kit (QIAGEN) on a

111

QIAsymphony automated extractor (QIAGEN) according to a modified manufacturer’s protocol.

112

Extracted nucleic acids were filtered through OneStep PCR inhibitor removal kit (Zymoresearch)

113

according the manufacturer’s instructions.

114

Molecular detection method

115

The RT-qPCR primers and PCR conditions used herein have been previously described (26). The

116

amplification was done using Fast virus 1-step Master mix 4x (Lifetechnologies) with oligonucleotide

117

concentrations recommended previously. Detection and quantification were carried on the E gene by

118

RT-qPCR. Positive results were confirmed by amplification of a region located within the gene

119

encoding for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). An internal positive control (IPC) was

120

added to evaluate the presence of residual inhibitors. The detection limit was estimated to be

121

around 103 genome units per liter of raw wastewater.

122

The quantification was performed using a standard curve based on synthetic oligonucleotide

123

corresponding to the full-length amplicon on the E gene (SARS-Cov2 Wuhan-Hu isolate sequence

124

NC_045512.2). Amplification reaction and fluorescence detection were performed on Viaa7 Real

125

Time PCR system (Lifetechnologies).

126

Modelization of Viral RNA excretion

127

Even if the real number of infected people is unknown, we attempted to compute the expected

128

amount of viral RNA shed in stools, using available information. Since the very beginning of the

129

epidemic, the daily number of patients consulting at the emergency department of greater Paris

130

hospitals

131

(https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/). Wölfel et al. measured the daily amount of vRNA in swab

132

samples for few patients (27). This data was used as an estimation of viral expression for all infected

and

diagnosed

with

COVID

symptoms

was

published

133

people and we also assume that people with symptoms would consult 2 days after the onset of the

134

illness, and that at any moment the number of patients with strong symptoms was proportional to

135

the total number of infected people. Accepting the above hypothesis, the convolution of two dataset

136

(i.e. number of consulting patient and model of excretion) is an emission-proxy, proportional to the

137

total amount of viral RNA shed in stools in a given population.

138

Results

139

Three major wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) managing over 75 000 cubic meters per day, were

140

sampled at the inlet of the plant from March 5th to April 23th 2020. All processed samples scored

141

positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes as assessed by RT-qPCR on the viral E gene. All

142

positive samples were confirmed by RT-qPCR on the viral RdRp gene (Figure 1). The COVID-19

143

epidemic in the same region was illustrated by various indicators such as the total number of COVID-

144

19 cases treated in the regional hospitals, the accumulation of hospitalized patients or the daily

145

death toll linked to COVID 19. Based on these epidemiologic statistics and on published data on virus

146

shedding quantity and delay, an estimated indicator of the viral excretion in the region was

147

calculated and compared to the viral load in wastewaters.

148

Briefly, the concentration of vRNA in raw wastewater was around 5.104 genome units /L on the 5th of

149

March 2020. At the same date, less than 10 COVID-19 confirmed patients were reported and only

150

404 individuals were tested positive in France. For the Parisian area more specifically, 91 confirmed

151

cases were reported at that time (on a total number of more than 12 million inhabitants) and no

152

death was recorded. Altogether this information indicated that the COVID-19 epidemic was at an

153

early stage in the Parisian area.

154

The time-course monitoring of viral load in WW displayed an exponential increase (from 5.104 GU/L

155

on March 5th to 3.106 GU/L, a 2-log increase in average). A peak was observed on the 9th of April,

156

followed by a marked decrease (1-log reduction in average). The shape of the concentration curve

157

was reminiscent of the disease dynamics at the regional level, with an 8-day temporal shift.

158

Altogether these results underline that essential information could be obtain from wastewater

159

epidemical monitoring, such as early starting of the epidemics, evolution of the infections, and

160

impact of the lockdown procedures.

Discussion

163

It is demonstrated here for the first time that a quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters

164

could reflect the circulation of the virus in human populations in the Parisian area, a region called Ile-

165

de-France. Since similar results were obtained from three independent and distant WWTP around

166

Paris with striking similarities, the time-course survey that has been done is likely to be a direct

167

reflect of SARS-CoV-2 dynamic in Parisian inhabitants that are connected to these WWTP. It is to note

168

that at home lockdown is effective since March 17th 2020, therefore limiting daily transport.

169

Importantly no significant rain fall was recorded in the Parisian area that could have had an impact

170

on virus concentration in wastewaters. More surprisingly this decrease stopped after 7 days, and the

171

virus concentration has been stable since. This plateau is intriguing, although the emission-proxy

172

suggests that it can partly be explained by the duration of the virus shedding period, and several

173

hypotheses can be made. First, one may suggest that many infected people are still secreting viruses

174

in their feces whereas the virus is not present anymore in the ORL region. This hypothesis has

175

recently been confirmed in Chinese patients with longer periods of excretion than reported by Wölfel

176

(7). Second, lockdown has been partial since some specific workers have been allowed to pursue

177

essential activities that were not compatible with homeworking. These people are usually not

178

considered at risk of severe infections (i.e. more pauci-symptomatic case), but they may promote

179

virus circulation at a low level notably in their family if they do not strictly respect hands cleaning and

180

mask wearing. Third, one may suggest that lockdown is not respected by few people that maintain

181

virus circulation at a low but significant level. Virus survey in the same WWTP will likely provide some

182

answers in the following weeks.

183

The observed delay between epidemiological curves in humans compared to virus quantification in

184

wastewaters is probably due to several parameters. This may include the effective number of

185

infected people, the timing and temporal kinetics of viral shredding in feces and other causes that

186

are still to be investigated. Nevertheless, our data are in very good agreement with epidemiological

187

parameters such as the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients or our excretion model. To that

188

respect, let us note that our study provides a strong indirect evidence for a significant reduction of

189

virus transmission in response to lockdown. According to our results, the number of people

190

producing SARS-CoV-2 is likely underestimated when based on individual testing, especially during a

191

pandemic where a limited quantity of virological tests did not allow for extensive testing so far. As a

192

comparison the quantity of human enteric virus concentration in raw wastewater is around 106 per

193

liter (17).

194

Epidemiological investigations that have been conducted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship

195

suggested that less than 20% of infected people were asymptomatic (12). Most of the infected

196

people were reported to exhibit moderate nonspecific symptoms including fever, headache, body

197

aches, intense tiredness and/or dry cough. However infected people can produce SARS-CoV-2 for a

198

few days before the onset of symptoms and up to several days after recovery (2,7,28). Another

199

extensive study based on Iceland population shows that 43% of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients did not

200

report any symptoms (29). In this context, a clear majority of infected carriers may silently

201

contaminate sensitive people. This led us to suggest that the contamination of raw wastewaters may

202

occur before the significative appearance of clinical cases. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in

203

wastewater was in good agreement with the dynamics of pandemic during the first wave of infection

204

in urbanized area, which is also in agreement with the excretion model that is proposed here. To our

205

knowledge this is the first report demonstrating that the quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in

206

raw wastewater is a time-related relevant indicator of the evolution of the health status of a

207

population linked to a sewage network. This quantitative approach was especially useful to

208

unrevealed the dynamics of the pandemic and follow impact of government measures such as

209

containment.

210

To finish, this data, if carefully utilized, could help to describe the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 excretors

211

during all the monitored pandemic event and allow to calculate the immunity of the population,

212

especially at the local level.

213

Conclusions

214

Our results strongly argue for the use of a quantitative monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in urban

215

wastewaters. This would also argue for a long-time conservation of wastewater samples in dedicated

216

local i.e. wastewater-bank, which would allow a retrospective investigation of pathogens circulation.

217

Additionally, wastewaters survey may provide an alternative and possibly early tool to detect

218

pathogens in populations when investigations in humans are difficult to conduct for logistic, ethical

219

or economic reasons, notably in poor countries that are strongly exposed to COVID-19 epidemic.
