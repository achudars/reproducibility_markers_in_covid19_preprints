Abstract

49

Background: The SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

50

cycle of threshold (Ct) has been used to estimate quantitative viral load, with the goal of

51

targeting isolation precautions for individuals with COVID-19 and guiding public health

52

interventions. However, variability in specimen quality can alter the Ct values obtained from

53

SARS-CoV-2 clinical assays. We sought to define how variable nasopharyngeal (NP) swab

54

quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity.

55

Methods: We performed amplification of a human gene target (β-actin) in parallel with a clinical

56

RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from

57

patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the relationship between NP

58

specimen quality, characterized by high Ct values for the human gene target β-actin Ct, and the

59

probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as well as the linear relationship

60

between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct.

61

Results: Low quality NP swabs are less likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI

62

0.523 to 0.802). We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct

63

values (slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated

64

with β-actin Ct values.

65

Conclusions: Variability in NP specimen quality accounts for significant differences in the

66

sensitivity of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP specimens, which are

67

characterized by a low level of amplifiable human DNA target, may limit the application of

68

SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to direct infection control and public health interventions.

Introduction:

72

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to drive morbidity and mortality around the world, interest

73

has grown in using SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

74

cycle of threshold (Ct) values as a means of quantifying viral load (1, 2). It has been proposed

75

that SARS-CoV-2 Ct values may correspond with viral burden and infectivity, and that SARS-

76

CoV-2 values may be used to predict disease severity and guide isolation precautions for

77

individuals with COVID-19 (3–7). SARS-CoV-2 Ct values have been shown to correspond with

78

community COVID-19 burden, and it has also been proposed that community Ct values may

79

help to guide non-pharmaceutical interventions to control COVID-19 (8).

80

We sought to understand the impact of nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen swab quality on the

81

measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Ct and the sensitivity of virus detection. To collect an NP swab

82

for SARS-CoV-2 testing, healthcare workers are instructed to advance a synthetic fiber swab

83

with plastic or wire shaft through the nostril until contacting the posterior nasopharynx at a depth

84

equal to the distance from the nostril to the opening of the ear, then to rub and roll the swab,

85

leaving the swab in place for several seconds to collect secretions, before rotating the swab

86

further as it is removed from the nostril (9). Variability in practice and patient tolerance of the

87

procedure has been observed, and may impact the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection, as well

88

as the cycle threshold (Ct) value observed when SARS-CoV-2 is detected (10–12).

89

To measure variability in the quality of NP swab collection, we performed amplification of a

90

human gene target (β-actin) in parallel with RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene.

91

High β-actin Ct values have been previously validated as a marker of poor NP swab quality (2,

92

13). Below we report the relationship between quality of NP swab collection, sensitivity of

93

SARS-CoV-2 detection, and the range of impact we expect sub-standard NP swab collection

94

may exert on SARS-CoV-2 Ct values. We also examine the possibility of confounding by

95

COVID-19 disease severity.

Materials and Methods:

98

Study Design, Setting, and Population: We performed a retrospective cohort study, capturing

99

consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests performed at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of

100

the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between March 26 and July 4, 2020. We included

101

all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results performed on NP specimens via the BD Max SARS-CoV-2

102

assay (Becton Dickinson) for which a positive PCR control analyte (MS2 phage DNA) was

103

detected. A total of 1311 NP specimens were included. All specimens were assayed for β-actin

104

and MS2 phage DNA in parallel with SARS-CoV-2. A waiver of informed consent was granted

105

by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB protocols #843085 &

106

#843274).

107

Causal Models: We hypothesized that β-actin and SARS-CoV-2 Ct values are related because

108

poor NP specimen collection technique results in reduced capture of NP epithelial cells and

109

SARS-CoV-2 alike. β-actin is a commonly used endogenous reference gene, used as an

110

internal control for PCR reactions involving human specimens. This gene has been previously

111

validated as a marker for the presence of nasal epithelial cells, and prior research has

112

supported its use to assess the quality of self-collected midturbinate swabs (2, 13). We

113

additionally considered the possibility of confounding by COVID-19 severity of illness. It is

114

possible that those with more severe infection may have greater NP epithelial cell damage,

115

resulting in greater detection of both PCR targets, irrespective of sampling technique.

116

Clinical Data Collection: To evaluate the possibility of confounding by disease severity, we

117

measured two independent markers of respiratory illness: (1) the minimum room-air oxygen

118

saturation recorded within 2 days of SARS-CoV-2 testing, and (2) whether infiltrates were

119

observed chest computerized tomography (CT) imaging performed within 7 days of SARS-CoV-

2 testing. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines(14), we considered

121

room-air oxygen saturation < 94% indicative of severe respiratory illness. Radiology reports for

122

CT imaging that described parenchymal lung disease, including “infiltrates”, “pneumonia”,

123

“groundglass”, or other “opacities”, were considered indicative of severe respiratory illness. The

124

presence of lung nodules, lung masses, chronic airway disease including bronchiectasis,

125

emphysematous changes, or pleural effusions in the absence of parenchymal disease as

126

described above, were not considered indicative of severe acute respiratory illness.

127

Specimen Collection, Processing, and RT-PCR Assay: Specimens were collected during

128

routine clinical practice using a nylon flocked mini-tip swab collected in VTM or saline.

129

Healthcare providers obtained samples using CDC guidelines for NP samples collection.

130

Samples were transported to the laboratory at ambient temperature and stored at 4⁰C if not run

131

immediately. Exk TNA2 extraction reagent kits (Becton Dickinson) for the BD MAX open system

132

reagent suite were used for the lab-developed SARS-CoV-2 assay based on a previously

133

described assay (15, 16). The BD MAX system was set to run type 1 workflow. PCR conditions

134

consisted of a reverse transcriptase step (600s at 58⁰C, 1 cycle), denaturation step (60s at

135

98⁰C, 1 cycle) and extension steps (10s at 98⁰C followed by 40s at 63⁰C, 40 cycles). Two

136

different sets of primer/probe master mix were prepared and 12.5 µl was aliquoted into BD MAX

137

0.3 mL snap-in conical tubes for storage at -70⁰C prior to use. The LUNA Universal Probe One-

138

Step RT-qPCR kit (New England Biolabs) was used to prepare the master mix according to

139

manufacturer guidelines with modified primer and probe concentrations. Master mix 1 was

140

composed of the SARS-CoV-2 orf1ab target (0.6 µM primers and 0.2 µM probe, sequences:

141

unpublished data), and the internal processing control MS2 bacteriophage (0.1 µM primers and

142

probe, sequences) (17). Master mix 2 contained the β-actin primers (0.6 µM) and probe (0.2

143

µM) (18). Samples were prepared by adding 200µl of NP specimen and 20 µl of specimen

144

processing control (5x106 pfu/mL MS2 Phage; Zeptometrix) to an Exk TNA2 sample buffer

145

tube. Sample buffer tubes containing patient specimens were loaded onto the BD MAX System

146

racks along with the Exk TNA2 test strips. Master mix 1, neutralization buffer (25 µl NucliSENS

147

easyMAG Extraction Buffer 3, Biomerieux) and master mix 2 were snapped in to open positions

148

2 to 4, respectively, on the test strip prior to loading the rack onto the BD MAX system. All NP

149

samples for which the specimen processing control target (MS2) was detected were included in

150

the study (n=1311). Ct values for all three targets (β-actin, MS2 and SARS-CoV-2) were

151

recorded.

152

Definition of Exposures and Outcomes: The primary exposure of interest was the β-actin Ct

153

value, a surrogate for the quality of NP swab collection. The primary outcome of interest was

154

SARS-CoV-2 Ct value.

155

Statistical Methods: Data were organized using R statistical software version 3.6.1 (19), and

156

plots generated using the “ggplot2” package (20). Where β-actin and SARS-CoV-2 were not

157

detected, Ct values were imputed as 40 cycles. We examined (1) the linear relationship

158

between β-actin and SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, as well as (2) the impact of β-actin Ct on SARS-

159

CoV-2 detection using Bayesian linear and generalized-linear mixed effects models, which were

160

fit using Stan Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) version 2.21, via the “brms” package with default

161

weakly-informative priors (21, 22). Prior predictive modeling was performed, and models were fit

162

with 4 chains of 1000 iterations, confirmed with HMC diagnostics (no divergent iterations, Rhat

163

statistic < 1.1 for all parameters, and E-BFMI > 0.2) (23–25). We examined parameter

164

distributions at 50%, 80%, and 95% posterior credible intervals to understand the relationship

165

between exposure and outcome variables.

166

Power and Sample Size: We estimated the necessary cohort size based on the anticipated

167

effect of poor NP swab quantity (26). We anticipated that approximately 800 subjects would

168

detect a 10% reduction in sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection related to a β-actin Ct increase of

169

10, with credible intervals precision ensuring type S error < 5% (27, 28). We targeted enrollment

Results:

175

SARS-CoV-2 Detection and Cycle of Threshold Range: Of 1311 tested specimens, 138 were

176

found to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 within 40 cycles of PCR. Among these specimens,

177

median SARS-CoV-2 Ct was 28.15 (IQR 20.5 to 32.98). No secular trend was observed

178

between calendar time from local onset of COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 Ct values during

179

the study period (Pearson correlation 0.18). Figure 1 depicts the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Ct

180

values.

181

Relationship between β-Actin and SARS-CoV-2 Cycle of Threshold: We evaluated the

182

relationship between NP specimen quality, meaured by β-actin Ct value, and SARS-CoV-2 test

183

sensitivity with logistic regression, and we found that increasing β-actin is significantly

184

associated with reduced detection of SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802).

185

Figure 2 depicts the relationship between β-actin and SARS-CoV-2 detection probability. We

186

further evaluated the linear relationship between β-actin and SARS-CoV-2 Ct values with linear

187

regression, and we found that SARS-CoV-2 Ct increases significantly with β-actin Ct (slope

188

0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). A linear model restricted to include only the 134 specimens

189

within which both SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin were detectable (i.e., Ct < 40) also found that

190

SARS-CoV-2 Ct increased with β-actin, but this relationship did not have high posterior certainty

191

(slope 0.254, 95%CI -0.23 to 0.73), and linear model fit was poor.

192

Impact of Poor NP Specimen Quality on SARS-CoV-2 Detection Sensitivity: To understand

193

the potential impact of poor NP specimen quality, we evaluated the change in probability of

194

SARS-CoV-2 detection as β-actin Ct increases. We found that a 4-Ct increase in β-actin, from

195

Ct of 28 to Ct of 32 (roughly from the first quartile of observed β-actin Ct values to the third

196

quartile) results in a 5.4% (95%CI 2.7% to 8.2%) decreased probability of SARS-CoV-2

197

detection.

198

Impact of Disease Severity on Relationship Between β-Actin and SARS-CoV-2 Cycle of

199

Threshold: Considering the possibility that the observed association between SARS-CoV-2 and

200

β-actin Ct values is confounded by respiratory illness severity, we evaluated the relationship

201

between β-actin Ct and independent markers of respiratory illness. Oxygen saturation data were

202

available for 428 (32.6%) subjects; chest CT imaging was available for 111 (8.5%) subjects.

203

Linear regression relating β-actin Ct values to oxygen saturation revealed no significant

204

association, and the point estimate of association ran counter to concern for confounding by

205

disease severity. Lower oxygen saturation was in fact associated with higher β-actin Ct values

206

(less β-actin amplicon), with linear regression slope -0.04 (95%CI -0.273 to 0.182). Similarly, we

207

found that the presence of parenchymal lung disease on chest CT radiography reports had no

208

significant association with β-actin Ct values, and that the point estimate of association actually

209

suggests lung parenchymal infiltrates are associated with higher β-actin Ct values (less β-actin

210

Ct amplicon) with linear regression slope 0.428 (95%CI -0.655 to 1.61). These analyses of

211

independent markers of severe respiratory disease suggest that it is NP specimen quality, not

212

disease severity, that drives the association between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin Ct values.

213
214

Discussion:

215

In this study, we found that higher β-actin Ct values, which have been previously validated as a

216

marker of low NP swab quality (2, 13), were associated with reduced probability of SARS-CoV-2

217

detection (odds ratio 0.654, 95%CI 0.523 to 0.802) and with higher SARS-CoV-2 Ct values

218

(linear regression slope 0.169, 95%CI 0.092 to 0.247). In our cohort, we observed 10.5% of

219

tested NP specimens had detectable SARS-CoV-2. Based on the observed impact of NP

220

specimen quality, we estimate that the reduction of quality NP specimen collection that results in

221

β-actin Ct increasing from 28 to 32 (roughly 25% to 75% percentile) decreases the absolute

222

probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 5.4% (95%CI 2.7% to 8.2%). This finding has several

223

important implications. First, the correlation between β-actin Ct and SARS-CoV-2 suggests that

224

quantitative interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 human specimens may be enhanced by adjusting for

225

the β-actin Ct. Second, the data support the concern that poor specimen collection may

226

contribute to false-negative results. The concern of false-negative NP SARS-CoV-2 testing has

227

led to the recommendation to retest patients with moderate to high clinical suspicion of COVID-

228

19 (29, 30). Reporting the β-actin Ct, or a β-actin-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 Ct may allow clinicians

229

to better interpret specimen quality when considering retesting.

230

We considered the possibility that the observed relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-actin

231

Ct values might be confounded by respiratory disease severity, but we found no significant

232

association between independent markers of severe respiratory disease and lower β-actin Ct

233

values. However, several limitations of our analysis must be acknowledged. Oxygen saturation

234

data and chest CT radiography reports were only available for a small percentage (32.6% and

235

8.5%, respectively) of our subjects. Subject demographics and medical comorbidities could not

236

be ascertained for subjects, so unmeasured confounders may contribute to the observed

237

association.

238

Nevertheless, we believe that the observed association between NP specimen quality and

239

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR sensitivity is an important finding. From 1311 NP specimens submitted

240

for SARS-CoV-2 testing, we have quantified the variation in specimen quality measured by β-

241

actin Ct value, and we have defined the impact of the observed variation on test sensitivity and

242

SARS-CoV-2 Ct values.

243

SARS-CoV-2 Ct values have shown promise as a means to roughly quantify viral burden and so

244

to guide infection control and public health interventions (1, 2, 4–8). However, variability in NP

245

specimen collection may exert large effects on observed SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, limiting these

246

useful applications. As testing efforts expand, infrastructure to ensure quality sample collection

247

must expand as well (9). Concurrent measurement of a β-actin human gene target may provide

248

a means to recognize and adjust for variability in NP specimen quality.
