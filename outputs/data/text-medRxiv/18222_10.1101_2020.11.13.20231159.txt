Abstract
The novel coronal virus has spread across more than 213 countries within the
space of six months causing devastating public health hazard and monumental economic loss. In the absence of clinically approved pharmaceutical intervention, attentions are shifted to non-pharmaceutical controls to mitigate the burden of the
novel pandemic. In this regard, a ten mutually exclusive compartmental mathematical model is developed to investigate possible effects of both pharmaceutical and
non-pharmaceutical controls incorporating both private and government’s quarantine and treatments. Several reproduction numbers were calculated and used to
determine the impact of both control measures as well as projected benefits of social
distancing, treatments and vaccination. We investigate and compare the possible
impact of social distancing incorporating different levels of vaccination, with vaccination programme incorporating different levels of treatment. Using the officially
published South African COVID-19 data, the numerical simulation shows that the
community reproduction threshold will be 30 when there is no social distancing but
will drastically reduced to 5 (about 83% reduction) when social distancing is enforced. Furthermore, when there is vaccination with perfect efficacy, the community
reproduction threshold will be 4 which increases to 12 (about 67% increment) without vaccination. We also established that the implementation of both interventions
is enough to curtail the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa which is in
confirmation with the recommendation of the world health organization.

Introduction

The novel corona-virus which was first discovered in Wuhan city of China in December
2019 has taken the world by storm [27, 29]. Presently, COVID-19 (caused by the novel

SARS-CoV-2 corona-virus) has affected over 213 countries across the world with more
than 18 million cases and daily reported cases of 250 000 as at August 5, 2020 [4, 27, 29].
The United State maintains its lead as the epicenter of the pandemic with more than
4,000,000 cases and about 160,0000 causalities. In Africa, South Africa is the epicenter of
the pandemic with over half a million cases, more than 8,000 deaths but with an impressive
69% recovery rate as at August 4, 2020 [7].
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed the first case of COVID19 in South Africa on March 1, 2020 [19]. Majority of the COVID-19 fatality and severe
cases occur among the aged populations of about 60 years and above, and to people with
underlying medical conditions . However, adults and young people with sound medical
conditions are less prone to COVID-19 fatality [2].
Just like other viruses such as the Flu and Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome diseases
[29, 33], COVID-19 is also transmitted from person-to-person through direct contact with
infected surfaces, objects, body fluid, blood or through inhalation of respiratory droplets
from infected individuals whether symptomatic or asymptomatic [1]. The latent period of
the virus is between 2-14 days [17, 5]. Majority of the infected persons show mild symptom
(or no symptoms at all) though popular symptoms include but not limited to headache,
fever, shortness of breath, cough and pneumonia ranging from mild to severe cases [27].
Due to the unavailability of pharmaceutical interventions such as suitable vaccines
and a COVID-19 anti-viral medication, the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions like restriction of movement, social distancing, face-masks usage, quarantine of
exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and tested cases, contact-tracing and so on are the
commonly prescribed measures by the world health organization [8, 20]. The recommendation of strict social distancing measure was also among the regular healthcare guidelines
that was prescribed by the South African medical practitioners for curbing the spread of
COVID-19, since the virus is transmitted among persons. For this reason, approximately
five months ago, strict social distancing intervention like complete lock-down, school closure, closure of non-essential businesses were all imposed in several countries of the world
including South Africa which was later relaxed in mid-May, 2020 [24, 28].
Several researchers, government agencies and pharmaceutical companies have stormed
the laboratories to develop safe and effective vaccines to curtail the menace of COVID-19.
Realistically, development of a vaccine generally takes more than a year, many organizations have already started and all hopes are high that the vaccine will be available sooner
rather than later [3]. Fortunately at the Oxford University, the Jenner Institute among
other research institutes have developed a new COVID-19 vaccine which is expected to be
available before the end of 2020 [14].
Several models have been published on COVID-19 [8, 10, 11, 17, 18, 32] , some of
them are reviewed subsequently. Gumel et al. (2020) [11] studied the possibility of an
imperfect COVID-19 vaccine in the United State of America. In their work, the equation
for the minimum number of susceptible individuals (that are excluded from the vaccination
programme) needed to be vaccinated to obtain vaccine-induced community herd immunity
was developed. The authors further investigated the epidemiological consequence of the
herd immunity threshold and stressed that the virus can be totally controlled or defeated if
the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the country. They finally simulated

the model equation using certain parameter values for the concerned states in the US,
including, Florida and New York and determined the minimum herd immunity threshold
for each state.
Jia et al. (2020) [12] studied the control of COVID-19 and the impact of policy interventions with meteorological factors in China using seven compartments. After fitting
their model with officially published data, they estimated parameter values for the proposed model using Least-Squares procedure. After obtaining the reproduction number of
each province in China, they proposed that the quarantine period must be long enough
to reduce contact. They also introduced comprehensive meteorological index to represent
the meteorological factors as well as vaccination strategies for different control measures.
Mushayabasa et al. (2020) [18] studied the role of governmental action and individual
reaction on COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa using mathematical modeling approach.
The proposed model examines relevant biological factors and effects of individual behavioral reaction including some interventions like consistent hygiene measures, quarantine,
lock-down among others. Using officially published South African COVID-19 data available as at March 2020 to early May 2020, the model examines the optimal conditions
necessary for the infection to die out and persist. Other commendable research works can
be found in [15, 16, 34] and references therein.
The current study examines the effect of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical
controls in curbing the infectiousness of the novel coronavirus disease. The incorporated
pharmaceutical interventions include a perfect vaccine with varying potency and efficacy
level for the susceptible individuals. Due to the over saturated nature of both the private and public hospitals because of the rapidly growing number of confirmed cases, the
model considered personal treatment as an alternative to the South African government’s
provided treatments. The same reason also applies to the already congested and oversubscribed isolation and quarantine centers provided by the South African government;
we include self isolation mechanism as a non-pharmaceutical control techniques. Since no
research has shown that some people are permanently immune from COVID-19, we considered that the infected individuals can become susceptible immediately after recovery.
Furthermore, we considered the effect of social distancing and its efficacy level as well as
vaccination. All these underline the novelty of this research work because to the best of our
knowledge, no such model has considered both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical
control mechanism concurrently. To examine the reliability of the model, the model parameters were parameterized using officially published South African COVID-19 data that
provide a realistic assessment and estimation of the severity of the virus in the country
population.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discussed materials and methods
used in the analysis as well as the model formulation. The main analytic results are
discussed in section 3. Section 4 entails the numerical simulation and the projected impacts
of the interventions while section 5 discussed and compared results with the existing
literature findings. Finally, the paper ends with a concluding remark in section 6.

Mathematical Model Formulation

The novel COVID-19 model we proposed consists of 10 mutually exclusive compartments
of susceptible class S(t), vaccinated susceptible class Sv (t), unvaccinated susceptible class
Suv (t), Exposed class E(t), individuals on government’s quarantined facility GQ (t), individuals on personal quarantine facility PQ (t), infected individuals I(t), individuals on
personal treatment (PT ), individuals on government’s treatment facility GT (t) and the
recovered class R(t) such that the total population is given by
N (t) = S(t) + Sv (t) + Suv (t) + E(t) + GQ (t) + PQ (t) + I(t) + PT (t) + QT (t) + R(t). (1)
We need to declare here that Λ is the recruitment rate of individuals into the community.
The susceptible class is reduced by a proportion ρ for the vaccinated susceptible individuals
who move directly into the Sv class while a proportion (1 − ρ) who are not vaccinated
perhaps due to lack of information or fear of contracting the virus move to the Suv (t)
class. The proportion of people who are found uninfected after the 14-day governments’
quarantine move to the S class at the rate b2 , e is the rate at which vaccinated susceptible
persons loses their immunity and return to the susceptible class.
Those who are equally found uninfected after the 14-day personal quarantine also move
to the susceptible class at the rate b1 , the recovered persons after treatment or after being
tested negative loss their immunity and hence return back to the susceptible class at the
rate η2 . The susceptible class is further reduced through natural death µ and breakthrough
of infection after successfully contacting an infected individuals leading to infection at the
rate λ given by
θ1 E θ2 I
+
,
(2)
λ=
N
N
where θ1 , θ2 is the contact rate for the exposed class E and infected class I respectively
through contact with infected surface, droplet and infected individuals who failed to practice social distancing. It is worth noting here that we only considered infection can be
contracted by individuals in classes E and I only because all other infected classes are
either on treatment or quarantined and are assumed to be less involved in the transmission
process. The unvaccinated susceptible class Suv is reduced by breakthrough of infection
denoted by λ and consequently moved to the I class.
The exposed class E is composed of susceptible individuals who are infected at the rate
λS and vaccinated susceptible individuals at the rate λSv who have been infected after
successful contact with individuals who tested positive. They are reduced by movement
of individuals at the rate v1 in to GQ class, v2 into I class, v3 into PQ class and natural
death at the rate µ. We should also mention here that the exposed individuals also include
those with mild symptoms of COVID-19, this can be confirmed and affirmed by available
published data from WHO that around 80% of the COVID-19 confirmed and tested cases
show mild or no symptoms [30]. More so, persons in this class especially those who
are 65 years and above or individuals suffering from underlying ailment can develop a
mild form of pneumonia that are expected to self-isolate for minimum period of 14 days
[23, 32]. Furthermore, majority of persons in this class whether with symptoms or not can
be diagnosed through effective testing and contact tracing of the contacts of confirmed
COVID-19 cases which consequently move to I(t) class, quarantined or treated.

The individuals in government’s quarantine facility GQ are further reduced by progression rate h1 to I class and natural death. Those on personal quarantine facility are further
reduced by progression rate h2 into I class. Also the quarantined individuals are those who
have been traced following effective contact with a close contact who tested positive (i.e.,
a confirmed COVID-19 infected person they have been exposed to). Those quarantined
are considered susceptible or unaware infected and are expected to be tested to determine
their status. More so, people can also be quarantined because of either traveling to areas
with high risk of infection such as China, Italy, Spain etc.
The I class contains progression from E class at the rate v2 , GQ class at the rate
h1 , PT class at the rate h2 , force of infection from Suv at the rate λSuv and the class is
reduced by treatment rates f1 and f2 , death rate µ and COVID-19 induced death rate δ.
The compartment PT and GT consist of progression rates f1 and f2 respectively from I
class, COVID-19 induced death rates δ2 and δ1 respectively and recovery rates τ2 and τ1
respectively while η2 is the loss of immunity rate after recovery.

Analytic Results
Positivity of Solution

This section contains basic results of the model equations (3)-(12) established as follows.
Lemma 3.1. Let the initial conditions in (13) exist in the interval t ∈ [0, ∞] then the solutions S(t), Sv (t), Suv (t), E(t), GQ (t), PQ (t), I(t), PT (t), GT (t), and R(t) of the model equations (3)-(12) are positive for all t ≥ 0.

Proof. Vividly, it can be observed that the right-hand side of (3)-(12) is locally Liptschitzian, continuous and differentiable on the space of continuous function κ, the solution
of S(t), Sv (t), Suv (t), E(t), GQ (t), PQ (t), I(t), PT (t), GT (t), and R(t) under the stated initial
conditions (13) uniquely exist on [0, β], where 0 < β ≤ ∞. Assuming that the solution
components of the model equations (3)-(12) are not positive, then there exists a first time
t∗ > 0 defined as follows
t∗ = inf {t|S(t) = 0 or Sv (t) = 0 or Suv (t) = 0 or E(t) = 0 or GQ (t) = 0 or
PQ (t) = 0 or I(t) = 0 or PT (t) = 0 or GT (t) = 0 or R(t) = 0} .
Suppose
S(t∗ ) = 0, S(t) > 0, Sv (t) > 0, Suv (t) > 0, E(t) > 0, GQ (t) > 0, PQ (t) > 0,
I(t) > 0, PT (t) > 0, GT (t) > 0 and R(t) > 0

)
for t ∈ (0, t∗ ) then dS(t
< 0. But unfortunately, from (3), dS(t
= Λ > 0 (where all model

parameters are assumed positive) which shows that S(t) > 0. Consequently, following the
same approach, we claim that the solutions Sv (t), Suv (t), E(t), GQ (t), PQ (t), I(t), PT (t), GT (t)
and R(t) are positive for all time t ≥ 0 [9, 21, 22].

Lemma 3.2. The biological invariant region

is positively attracting and invariant for the model (3)-(12).
Proof. The summation of equations (3)-(12) yields
dN
= Λ − µN − (δI + δ1 GT + δ2 PT ) ≤ Λ − µN.
dt

(14)

Using Gronwall inequality, the solution of (14) is given by
N (t) ≤ N (0)e−µt +

Λ
[1 − e−µt ].
µ

It can be observed that N (t) ≤ Λµ if N (0) ≤ Λµ . Therefore, χ is positively invariant. Hence,
it is sufficient to study the COVID-19 model in χ. Thus, we conclude that the model
(3)-(12) is epidemiologically welposed and attracting [9, 21, 22].

The threshold parameter RA is the control reproduction number of (3)-(12). It is used in
measuring the average number of new COVID-19 cases generated by a single infected individual introduced into a community/population where a certain fraction of the population

Hence, we have the result below.

then RA = 0. This clearly means that strict social distancing can go a long way in reducing the generation of inter-community transmission of COVID-19 to zero. This is in
confirmation with the recommendation of the World Health Organization [8, 20] and the
work of [11].
To get the basic reproduction number without any control measures, we set all intervention parameters to zero i.e. ρ = γ1 = f1 = f2 = v1 = v3 = Sv = Suv = 0, to
have

Ro =

since S ∗ = N ∗ . It is easy to conclude that
Ro > R N P I > RA ,

(21)

Ro > RP I > RA ,

(22)

and
which is in confirmation and agreement with the work of [11]. Simulating all the results in this section using the parameter values and data presented under section 4 when
ρ = γ1 = 0.8, the reproduction number in equation (17) when all the control measures are
implemented gives 0.5521 (< 1 which is locally asymptotically stable). The one in equation (18) when only the non-pharmaceutical intervention is implemented gives 19.4827
(> 1 which is not locally asymptotically stable) while that of equation (19) when only the
pharmaceutical intervention is implemented gives 0.8133 (< 1 which is locally asymptotically stable) . When all interventions are set to zero as appeared in equation (20), the
reproduction number becomes 19.6815 (> 1 which is not locally asymptotically stable).
All these are in good agreement with the expressions in equation (21) and (22).

Numerical Simulation of The Impacts of Interventions and Model Fitting

Taking South Africa as a case study, we present the numerical simulation of the presented
model equations (3)-(12) to understand the impacts of all intervention strategies.

4.1

Data Acquisition and Parameter Estimation

The detailed acquisition of the data and the estimation of model parameters using the
officially published COVID-19 data within the period of July 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020
shall be extensively discussed here. The simple rationale behind the choice of taking South
Africa as a case study is because South Africa has maintained the crown as the COVID-19
epicenter in Africa. The Figure 2 (reproduced in bar-chart form) shows the spread of the
pandemic across several countries in the world.
As at July 31, 2020, the number of confirmed cases in South Africa was 493,183 [31] with
135,214 active cases which account for approximately 2.5% of the total world COVID-19
cases [31]. More worryingly, South Africa is currently ranked 5th among the most affected
countries. In the month of July alone, South Africa recorded more than 60% of their total
confirmed cases. The month of July, according to experts, is the peak of cases detection in
the country and it really underlines the reason why the country is considered best choice
for this research.
According to the South African mid-year population [25], the migration/recruitment
rate is estimated at 18% of the total population which is 1,039,749 equivalent to 2,795
people per day. Hence, parameter Λ = 2, 795. It is also revealed from the data that
South African life expectancy for both sexes is 64.88 years, therefore the natural death
1
. The total reported death from COVID-19 complications with
rate is given by µ = 64.88
the period of July 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 is 5,256 which makes the death rate estimated
at δ = 0.0157. Since the data for those that die under both personal and government
treatments are not clearly differentiated, we assume that δ1 = 0.0112 and δ2 = 0.0142.
It was also gathered that 71.% of infected people recovered so that the recovery rate is
for people under treatment in a government owned hospital is 0.710 and we assume that
τ2 = 0.0212 for those under personal treatment.
All other parameter values are extracted from available literature and referenced in
Table 1. After fitting the South African data to the model, from table 2, we set I = 159, 333
for the number of detected and confirmed cases. Since no vaccine is available presently,
we set Sv = Suv = 0. All other state variables can not be determined from the available
data as at the time of this research, so we chose the following
E = 290, 000, GQ = 220, 000,
PQ = 40, 000, PT = 15, 000, GT = 120, 000, R = 85, 000.
The South African population as at 2019 is estimated at 58,775,022 [25], therefore N =
58 × 106 and hence
S = N − (I + Sv + Suv + E + GQ + PQ + PT + GT + R) = 55 × 106 .

Model Fitting

To test the suitability of the model equations (3)-(12) to assess the impacts of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions in curbing the global pandemic, we have
extracted the monthly spread of the South African confirmed cases as appeared in figure
3. Since the month of July is the focus, we have consequently extracted the number of
daily confirmed cases for the said month as appeared in Table 2.
Using the earlier mentioned data, the equations (3)-(12) give a very good fit of the
South African COVID-19 data for the period of July 1, 2020-July 31, 2020 as depicted in
Figure 4. More-so, to examine the closeness of the model equations to the published data,
Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) method shall be used [13].

Suppose yOD denotes the published data. Then, the one predicted by the model given
by ypred is obtained using the equation:
yOD = αo + α1 ypred + ,

(23)

where αo denotes the intercept and α1 denotes the slope of the regression line and 
represents the random error. If the coefficient of determination R2 = 1, α0 = 0 and
α1 = 1, then the model is ideal. Using MATLAB, we obtained αo = 0.0832 and α1
= 0.9707 (with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals [0.0360 0.1101] and [0.9281
0.9782], respectively) and R2 = 0.9991 using the aforementioned initial data and parameter
values in Table 1 and 2. Thus, the OLS regression analysis established the closeness of
the model and the real data. Hence, the model equations (3)-(12) are realistic and can be
used to study the COVID-19 model and impacts of both interventions in South Africa.

Impacts of Social Distancing only on the Reproduction Number

The model (3)-(12) is firstly simulated for the special case where the only implemented
intervention is social distancing. Doing this will make it convenient for us to examine
the impact of social-distancing measures as the only anti-COVID-19 intervention strategy
in the country. It is worth noting here that social-distancing is measured in terms of the
reduction in the numerical values of θ1 and θ2 (known as contact rates ) from their baseline
values. The result obtained is presented in figure 5 in terms of the associated reproduction
number.

Figure 5: Impact of Social Distancing only on Reproduction Number.
We also have to mention here that the point where contact rates θ1 = θ2 = 0 corresponds to 100% level of social distancing while θ1 = θ2 = 1 corresponds to absolute
abuse/absence of the social distancing intervention. This is because social distancing is
a measure of reduction in contact rates. When contact rates reduce, social distancing is
upheld and when contact rates is high, social distancing is abused. From the presented
figure 5, when θ1 = θ2 = 0 (when social distancing is at 100%) the reproduction number which accounts for the rate at which community transmission occurs becomes zero.
Also, when θ1 = θ2 = 1 (when social distancing is totally disregarded) the reproduction
number becomes very high which is very dangerous in the fight against COVID-19. This
is in confirmation with the recommendation of WHO regarding the importance of social
distancing and lock-down.

Impacts of Social Distancing with Varying Level of Vaccination and Vaccine Efficacy on the Reproduction Number.

In this subsection, we shall incorporate vaccination to the already established social distancing intervention. Figure 6 shows the effect of social-distancing with different level of
vaccine and its efficacy.

level of vaccination and efficacy.
It can be observed that the higher the social distancing with different level of vaccination
and vaccine efficacy, the lower the COVID-19 transmission rate. In fact when the vaccination is at 0% the COVID-19 reproduction number was 2.2 in figure 6 (a) but when
vaccination is at 100%, the community COVID-19 transmission reduced to 0.08 in figure
6(d) which should be enough to contain the spread of the dreadful pandemic. We also
note in figure (5) that in the absence of social-distancing measure ie. when θ1 = θ2 = 1
the reproduction number was 30 but when vaccination was introduced at %100, the transmission rate dropped to 0.08 as depicted in figure 6 (d). This also underlines the effect of
robust vaccination in the fight against the notorious pandemic.

4.5

Impacts of Vaccination with Varying Level of Anti COVID19 Treatments on the Reproduction Number

We further incorporate both personal and government treatments to the already established vaccination programme. Figure 7 shows the effect of different level of treatments
under vaccination intervention.

importance of treatment and vaccination as recommended by the WHO.

4.6

Impacts of Both Interventions on the Reproduction Number

Finally we shall examine the combined effect of all the intervention strategies. We shall
consider the combined effects of pharmaceutical interventions first followed by non-pharmaceutical
interventions and then consider when both are concurrently implemented to combat the
pandemic.

Figure 8 clearly shows the importance of both intervention in curbing the pandemic.
The figures suggest that as much as the non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social
distancing, lock-down and face mask are important, the impacts of the pharmaceutical
interventions such as treatment and vaccination is absolutely incomparable in curbing the
disease. Figure 8 (c) vividly shows that both intervention will reduce the community
transmission to almost zero within a very short period of time.

Results and Discussion

A novel COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 which has infected 21,388,904 persons with more than 764,17 deaths across the globe as at August 15,
2020 at 3:00 pm [31]. Neither effective treatment nor vaccine is available at the moment,
attentions are consequently shifted to non pharmaceutical interventions such as maintenance of physical/social-distancing, use of nose-mask, face-shield, lock-down enforcement,
restriction of movement of non essential workers, shut down of economy, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of infected individuals among others. Efforts are also in advanced
stage that an anti-COVID 19 vaccine will be globally approved sooner rather than later.
After establishing the basic properties of the model which include positivity solution
and invariant region, we established the condition for local stability of the virus-free equilibrium (VFE) and we claimed that the VFE is stable when the associated threshold parameters is less than unity. The Theorem was stated which can be proved using Theorem
2 of [26]. The biological implication of this is that the novel corona-virus will die out of the
community whenever the associated threshold parameters Ro < 1, RN P I < 1, RP I < 1 as
the case maybe. In other words, if both recommended interventions (ie. social distancing,
quarantine, treatment and vaccination) are fully implemented, the threshold parameters
can be brought down to less than unity and consequently ensure the eradication of the
pandemic. This has been simulated under equations (19)-(22) as mentioned earlier.
Using the officially published South African COVID-19 data, the model equations (3)(12) gave a very good fit of the South African COVID-19 data for the period of July
1, 2020-July 31, 2020 as depicted in Figure 4. Furthermore, to qualitatively assess the
closeness of the model against the real data, we employed the Non-linear Least Squares
(NLS) method. We used MATLAB to obtain αo = 0.0832 and α1 = 0.9707 (with their
corresponding 95% confidence intervals [0.0360 0.1101] and [0.9281 0.9782], respectively)
and R2 = 0.9991 using the aforementioned initial data and parameter values in Table 1
and 2.
Several reproduction numbers were calculated such as the basic reproduction number
Ro , the reproduction number for pharmaceutical intervention only RP I and the reproduction number for non-pharmaceutical intervention only RN P I . We also explicitly explain
that the reproduction number (which is the measure of average number of new virus infection developed by a single COVID-19 infected individual in a community) is low (which
makes the virus transmission controllable) when intervention programmes are adequately
implemented and high when no intervention is implemented. This kind of analysis is missing in majority of the published COVID-19 models. Though it was partly analyzed in [11]
which was not as detailed as the one presented here and obviously missing in [15],[17],[18]
and [20].
The model was first simulated to obtain the effects of social distancing as the only
intervention strategy, while the other intervention strategies are set to zero. The result as
depicted in figure 5 shows that the reproduction number drastically reduced from 30 to
5 as the physical distancing is adequately implemented in the country. The reproduction
number consequently becomes zero when the physical distancing is maximum i.e (when
θ1 = θ2 = 0) and becomes 30 when no physical distancing is upheld and free mixing,

social gathering, school activities, social lives are allowed to continue as normal. This in
confirmation with the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) [27, 28,
29, 30], and the work of [11].
We further examined the impacts of social distancing with different vaccination level
and vaccine efficacy on the Reproduction Number in order to grasp the level of vaccination
and vaccine efficacy needed to curb the dynamics in South Africa. We considered the effects
of Social Distancing with 10%, 40%, 80% and 100% levels of vaccination and efficacy. It
can be seen that when social distancing remains constant, the reproduction rate of new
infected confirmed cases reduces drastically as the vaccine coverage and efficacy increases.
According to figures 6 (a,b,c,d), when the vaccination is at 0% the COVID-19 reproduction
number was 2.2 in figure 6 (a) but when vaccination is at 100%, the community COVID-19
transmission reduced to 0.08 in figure 6(d). Though it seems extremely difficult to obtain
this level of vaccine coverage and efficacy for many reasons. This is because sufficient
vaccine will be less available at the early stage of the vaccination process which may not
be enough to cover a country of almost 60 million population like South Africa. The
vaccine, at early production stage, may still be prone to some clinical errors needed to be
rectified as time goes on. So vaccination level and efficacy of upto 80%, 90% etc for almost
60 million population will seriously take a long period of time before it can be achievable.
That is the more reason why the simulation complemented vaccination coverage with
treatment and other non-intervention strategies like social distancing.
The impacts of vaccination with different treatment levels of anti-COVID-19 treatment
on the Reproduction Number was also examined. It can be observed that the higher the
vaccination and vaccine efficacy with different treatment levels, the lower the COVID-19
reproduction number. In fact, when the treatment level is at 0% the COVID-19 reproduction number was 12, but when the treatment level is at 100%, the community COVID-19
transmission reduced to 4 which accounts for almost 70% reduction in community transmission. This also underlines the importance of treatment and vaccination as recommended
by the WHO.

Concluding Remarks

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the causative agent of the novel
COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that
was first discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Within a very short period of
time, the virus has claimed lives of thousands of infected persons while more than 2 million
persons are hospitalized.
While researchers are still busy in the laboratories to develop vaccine to curb the menace, attentions are shifted to non-pharmaceutical controls to mitigate the burden of the
novel pandemic. To tackle this challenge, a ten compartmental mathematical model was
developed and presented in this paper to investigate the possible effects of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical controls such as self quarantine and treatments as well
as government’s provided quarantine and treatment facilities. Several reproduction numbers were calculated and used to determine the impact of both control measures as well

as projected benefits of social distancing, treatments and vaccination on the community
transmission.
We considered the impacts of social distancing only on the Reproduction Number.
We also investigated and compared the possible impact of social distancing with different levels of vaccination on the Reproduction Number. Furthermore, we examined the
impacts of vaccination while different levels of treatment was administered. Using the
officially published South African COVID-19 data, the numerical simulation showed that
the community reproduction number will be 30 when there is no social distancing but will
drastically reduced to 5 when social distancing is adequately implemented to some certain
degree of compliance. This accounts for more than 80% reduction in disease transmission.
More so, when vaccination with good efficacy was implemented, the community reproduction number was 4 which increases to 12 without vaccination. This accounts for almost
70% reduction in disease transmission.
Finally, we established that the implementation of both interventions is enough to
curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus disease in South Africa, which is in confirmation
with the recommendation of the world health organization and provided a better insight
to the pandemic than several other existing research work such as [11] (whose model is
less detailed) and [12] (whose work does not involve both interventions we considered).
