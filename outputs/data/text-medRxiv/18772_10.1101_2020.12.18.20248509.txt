Abstract Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are important to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases as long as no vaccination or outstanding
medical treatments are available. We assess the effectiveness of the sets of nonpharmaceutical interventions that were in place during the course of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in Germany. Our results are based on
hybrid models, combining SIR-type models on local scales with spatial resolution. In order to account for the age-dependence of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we include realistic pre-pandemic and

recently recorded contact patterns between age groups. The implementation of
non-pharmaceutical interventions will occur on changed contact patterns, improved isolation, or reduced infectiousness when, e.g., wearing masks. In order
to account for spatial heterogeneity, we use a graph approach and we include
high-quality information on commuting activities combined with traveling information from social networks. The remaining uncertainty will be accounted
for by a large number of randomized simulation runs. Based on the derived
factors for the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions over
the past months, we provide different forecast scenarios for the upcoming time.

1 Introduction
With more than 1.6 million reported deaths [46], the coronavirus disease 2019
(Covid-19) remains one of the most pressing issues for the whole globe. Already in October, WHO officials estimated that 10 % of the world’s population
had been infected [30] and vaccination of the population will still take a considerable amount of time. Since exposing people is highly unethical [91], the
only interim solution is to mitigate the spread of the disease by the application
of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
The assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions and prediction by simulation has to be based on reliable models; cf. [5,6,23,29,35,53,63,82,13] for
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)
and other infectious diseases. Only then, the most effective interventions can
be determined as a basis for informed political decisions.
The aim of our study is to assess non-pharmaceutical interventions and
to provide a reliable forecast of the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany based
on four principles. First, we account for the age-dependence of SARS-CoV2 [67,59,87]. Second, we include realistic contact patterns between different
age groups [62,37,68,45,47]. Third, we include high-quality, spatially resolved
information on commuting activities [10,12] combined with traveling information based on the social network Twitter. Fourth, we combine all information
and account for the remaining uncertainty by Monte-Carlo Ensemble runs. To
our knowledge, such an in-depth study is not accounted for in the literature
so far.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we
present our mathematical model and its numerical solution approach. In Section 3, we present the social and non-pharmaceutical parameters used in our
model, and in Section 4, we discuss the epidemiological parameters obtained
by extensive analyses. Our results are presented and discussed in Section 5.
We conclude this paper with Section 6.

Assessment of effective mitigation and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2

2 Model and solver
There are various models to forecast the spread of infectious diseases across
a country or community. Besides the well known SIR-type ODE models [52,
3], there are integro-differential models [52,51], Bayesian Monte Carlo approaches [82], or agent-based models [55,9]. While SIR-type models are praised
for their simplicity and understandability, they lack for a good representation
of spatial heterogeneity.
To combine the advantages of a SIR model without loss of spatial resolution, we use multiple SIR-type models on a fine local scale and connect the
compartments and age groups by graphs that represent traveling; cf. [2] among
others. These SIR-type models can be easily exchanged by agent-based models
due to the generic implementation of our graphs. This is integrated as part of
our high performance modular epidemics simulation software MEMILIO that
is continuously under development [1].

2.1 Age-resolved SIR-type model
The base of our SIR-type model can be found in the first version of [53]. Our
model consists of the compartments Susceptible (S), healthy individuals without immune memory of SARS-CoV-2; Exposed (E), who carry the virus but are
not yet infectious to others; Carrier (C), who carry the virus and are infectious
to others but do not yet show symptoms (they may be pre- or asymptomatic);
Infected (I), who carry the virus, are infectious and show symptoms; Hospitalized (H), who experience a severe development of the disease; In Intensive
Care Unit (U); Dead (D); and Recovered (R), who cannot be infected again.
To resolve age-specific disease parameters, we divide the totality of people N
into n different age groups. We then have
Z=

n
[
i=1

Zi =

n
[

{Si , Ei , Ci , Ii , Hi , Ui , Ri , Di }.

i=1

For each age group i = 1, . . . , n, the transmission risk is denoted by ρi and
the proportion of infected people not isolated or quarantined is denoted by
β̃i ; see Tables 1 and 2 for details. Infection results from contact with people
from different age groups. We introduce the nonsymmetric contact frequency
matrix
Φ = (φi,j )i,j=1,...,n ,

(1)

where φi,j represents the (mean) daily contacts of a person of age group i with
people from age group j. Since contact patterns are assumed to be nonsymmetric – think of contact rates of a group of school children with their teacher
and vice versa – this matrix will also be nonsymmetric.
The naming convention for the remaining parameters can be understood
as follows: We use the variables T∗∗12 for the time spent in state ∗1 ∈ Zi before

to recovery from the disease. Accordingly, µ∗∗21 represents the probability of a
patient to transit to state ∗2 when that patient is currently in state ∗1 .

The equations (2)–(9) represent the transition of people from one state to
another. Note that people in an age group Zi cannot transit to another group
Zj for i 6= j. In Section 4, we will discuss in detail which of the epidemiological
parameters we assume to be age-dependent and how this is included in our
model. These findings are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
2.2 Spatial resolution
While SIR-type models are straightforward to apply and interpret, they lack
the possibility of modeling local effects or spatial heterogeneity. In order to
avoid averaging over important effects such as infection clusters, we assign one
particular age-resolved model to each county. We represent each county by a
node of a (directed) graph. The edges of the graph represent the connections
between the different counties and are weighted with the number of people
commuting daily and traveling on average. The edges do not only hold single
values (weights) for how many people daily commute between different counties but also coefficients to determine the proportion of people of different age

2.3 Numerical solver
Common numerical solvers for the system of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations (2)-(9) are semi-implicit or adaptive explicit. While the former allow
for larger time steps, the latter allow adaptive time steps to prevent large
numerical errors. We have implemented an adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg45
(RKF45) method [33] that uses methods of 4th and 5th order and solves the
equations without excessively small time steps.
The numerical procedure becomes more challenging when we also resolve
the equations spatially. For this, we define a commuter as a person who travels
from county ak to al , 1 ≤ k, l ≤ nC and back again within one day (whether
it is work or free time related). Given start values from day t, we advance
our adaptive RKF45 solver for 0.5 days. Next, we allow people to commute or
travel. Their amount is defined by the commuter rate between two counties,
namely the weights wk,l introduced in Section 2.2 and further specified in

Section 3.1. Note that commuting also depends on the infection state since
hospitalized individuals cannot commute and infected individuals will travel
less than healthy ones. For the latter, we assume the same level of isolation or
quarantine as on county level. With the updated population, we again advance
our adaptive solver for 0.5 days.
Additionally, we conduct an auxiliary step with step size of 0.5 days with
an explicit Euler solver where we only consider the in-commuters, using the
county’s population as contact population only. This step is executed since,
after the high precision scheme from t+0.5 to t+1, we do not know the updated
state of our commuters (e.g., susceptible may have become exposed or carriers
have become symptomatic). This is due to the nature of the SIR model (2)-(9)
that does not keep track of individuals. Still, the commuters have to go back
to their home county, and we need to know their most likely infection state.
We use the results from the explicit Euler step, to quantify the proportion of
individuals of the different compartments that return. With this estimation, we
start the returning process. These considerations are summarized in Figure 3.

Fig. 3 Illustration of our numerical scheme for spatial heterogeneity. The individuals represent the compartments in our SIR model (2)-(9). First, we evolve County A and County B
separately, resulting in updated compartments in both counties. Then, a proportion of the
county’s population commutes. We solve the SIR model for another half day including the
new in-commuters and excluding the out-commuters. Additionally, we conduct one step of
an auxiliary low order scheme (with residents as contact persons only) to estimate the updated states of the in-commuters (shown in the dashed box). We then allow the commuters
to return home.

3 Social and non-pharmaceutical parameters
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 depends on many parameters. While some of these
parameters are inherent to the virus, others depend on social contact patterns
and non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced by decision makers. In this
section, we will focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions and their influence
on contact patterns and commuter rates in our model.

3.1 Inter-county travel
Let us first continue with the spatial resolution of our model and focus on how
we specify the rate of work or leisure commuters wk,l between different counties
ak and al . To estimate wk,l on the edge ek,l that connects both counties, we use
statistics from the German Federal Employment Agency [10] complemented
with geo-referenced Twitter data.
From [10], we have high quality information on work commuter activities.
For each county, we have the number of incoming commuters from each other
county. However, it is not specified if commuting takes place on a daily basis or
if workers work partially from home. From the raw data, we assume that any
commuting activity with linear distance of 100-200 km only happens twice a
week and for a distance of over 200 km, we assume that it happens only once
a week. That means, we scale the corresponding off-diagonal matrix entries

by 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. After this smoothing procedure, we remain with
about 11.8 million daily commuting activities. These values are then divided
by the approximate population size in working age. This results in the work
commuting population ck,l , 1 ≤ k, l ≤ nC which is only taken from age groups
and compartments that commute for work.
Motivated by [49,61], we also analyzed a totality of about 2.8 million georeferenced tweets obtained from the Twitter API [85] between January 1, 2018
and January 31, 2020. Since [10] is biased towards the working population, the
geo-referenced tweets act as a “counterpart” with a bias towards the younger
population, student commuters, and leisure traveling individuals. From the
totality of tweets, we first removed all tweets from users with more than 1000
tweets in the considered period to waive statistical anomalies introduced by
bots or hyperactive users. For each pair of consecutive user tweets in the
considered period, we then count one travel action from ak to al if the first
tweet happened from ak and the second happened from al , k 6= l. In order
to further reduce the influence of the most active users, we remove the first
300 users with the most travels. Then, there remain about 36 000 active users
from which 11 000 had five or more travel activities in the last two years. In
total, we have about 235 700 travel activities. In 95 % of the nontrivial matrix
entries, one unique user adds only two activities on average.
Although different in scale, the remaining tweets show similar travel patterns as obtained from [10]; see Figures 21-23 for a comparison. Note, however,
that a certain amount of deviation is to be expected since both sources are
biased towards either the working or the student population. In twitter mobility, for instance, we observe relatively strong connections to bigger cities like
Hamburg, Hannover, Cologne, or Stuttgart.
Assuming that the mobility obtained from Twitter accounts for 20 % of all
travel activities (work commuting, student commuting, leisure travel etc.), we
scale the twitter matrix accordingly. The resulting values are divided by the
population size and the result will be denoted by tk,l , 1 ≤ k, l ≤ nC .
The amount of mobility in our model is given be the edge weights ek,l
of the graph. These weights are derived from the matrix ck,l for the work
commuters and from tk,l for the ‘Twitter’ activities. The weights also depend
on the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, they
(∗)
(∗)
depend on the NPI related parameters rW,i,i for work and rO,i,i for ”other”
places related measures that mainly affect free-time activities. Here, ∗ ∈ {1, 2}
and i = 1, . . . , n are the corresponding age groups; see Section 3.3.2 and 3.3.1
and Table 3 for details on these parameters.
The commuter matrices contain many insignificant coefficients close to
zero. These are due to loosely coupled regions where only a very limited number
of individuals commute on a daily basis (e.g., 1 or 2). To reduce the computational effort, we eliminate edges ek,l where ck,l < 4 · 10−5 and tk,l < 1 · 10−5 .
The cutoff values are chosen so only 1 % of information is dropped and that
more than 99 % of travels are included. We also paid attention to reflect the
above assumption that Twitter data represents 20 % of travels. With this

In the following, we focus on the individual counties, interventions and contact

Germany.
As SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mainly during human-to-human interaction, reducing contacts can efficiently slow down the spread of the disease;
cf. [38,62,39,37,68] for literature on contacts and the spread of infectious diseases. However, lockdowns which effectively reduce contacts to a minimum
should be avoided due to their profound negative impact on many individuals
and communities [91]. Therefore, the challenge for many of today’s decision
makers is to find the most appropriate and effective interventions for the actual
developments.

Assessment of effective mitigation and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2

3.2.1 Pre-pandemic patterns
In order to quantify the potential of transmission reduction by contact pattern changes, good pre-pandemic as well as recent data is needed. From the
POLYMOD study [62] and its projections [68], we use realistic contact patterns for Germany split up into the categories “Home”, “School”, “Work”, and
“Other”. In [62], contacts are defined as skin-to-skin contact, or where at least
three words were exchanged.
For the particular case of school contacts, the mean numbers of contacts
recorded in [62] are rather low for Germany; cf. Figure 5 for a comparison of
the projection [68] for different European countries. Given the fact of aerosol
transmission risk in closed spaces, we suggest to assume slightly higher contact rates for a conservative estimate on the spread of the disease. Further
information is offered by the demography-based school contact matrix in [37].
We use the quotient of the maximum eigenvalues between both matrices to
scale the contact matrix of [68] which then results in a larger number of school
contacts.
The combination of baseline contacts for “Home”, “Work”, and “Other”
from [62,68] and for “School” based on the comparison of [68, 37] results in
the contact matrix φGer
B ; cf. Figure 4 (top).
3.2.2 SARS-CoV-2-related minimum patterns
The potential of possible contact reduction is limited by the minimum number of necessary contacts that keep essential sectors of the society running. To
assess this, we consider the contact study [45], that started during the lockdown phase in the United Kingdom. By the end of March, many ‘non-essential’
parts of the economy were shut down and social interaction was limited to a
K
minimum [40]. This study yields the minimum contact matrix ΦU
M .
K
The matrix ΦU
M is missing values since only individuals aged 18 or older
participated in [45]. In order to fill out the missing information, we follow a
strategy similar to [56]. We employ the pre-pandemic/baseline contact matrix
K
from [68]. We scale this matrix by the ratio of the dominant eigenvalues
ΦU

We aim at deriving a minimum contact matrix φGer

lockdown in Germany. We consider the number of contacts in the UK by the
end of March to be a minimum that we can achieve in a SARS-CoV-2-related
lockdown. From the UK data, we consider the quotient of contact reduction

In Figure 4, the minimum ΦGer
M is shown at the bottom.
Note that the single entries given in the bottom row of Figure 4 are not
required to be smaller than the ones in the top row. The minimum of contacts
during lockdown is to be understood as the minimum of total contacts of all
individuals. Locally, for one location and the interaction of two age groups, the
mean contacts could even increase slightly. For example, we see a small increase
of home contacts between individuals older than 80 years (factor 1.28), while
there is a drastic decrease of home contacts of individuals aged 80 years and
older with individuals between 15 to 35 years (factor 9.39). To conclude, the
difference between the top and bottom of Figure 4 defines realistic boundaries
for all non-pharmaceutical interventions that could possibly be implemented.
To assess uncertainty, we allow for a 5-10 % deviance of the given values in
our ensemble runs.
From [26], we have an estimated contact reduction during spring lockdown
in Germany of 63 %, taking the minimum values here, we could achieve a
contact reduction of 76 %.
3.3 Contact-related interventions
In this section, we discuss a variety of NPIs aimed at reducing the contacts
between individuals.
3.3.1 General interventions
There are two ways to reduce potentially dangerous contacts, namely, to avoid
the contacts at all or to wear masks and keep distance. The latter combination
has a significant effect. In many studies such as [88,8], face coverings and
ejected air flows while breathing, speaking, or coughing are studied. The meta
analyses in [60] and [70] find (large) protective effects of face masks for SARSCoV-2 transmission such as 40 % or even a pooled odds ratio of 0.35. In
particular, the protective effect of community-wide masks is shown in [25]. We
will consider different risk reduction ranges for wearing masks combined with
keeping distance and regular ventilation of closed spaces. We also take into
account that face masks are still more often worn in business than in private
situations [7].
In the predictive analysis of the spread of infectious diseases, not only nonpharmaceutical interventions and one-time contact changes but also adherence
to interventions is important. While there is a small decrease in adherence to
preventive measures observed in [47, 7] after months of the pandemic, the adherence is still large and rather stable with an even increasing number of people
wearing masks [7] (e.g., 93 % wear them often or always). In the consequence,
we do not include these opposing effects in our simulations.

3.3.2 Work-related interventions
While the mean number of daily contacts in Germany is lower than in many
other European countries, a relatively large percentage of contacts happens at
workplaces [62]. Hence, many transmissions can be avoided by working from
home whenever possible.
From a recent analysis of Germany [12], up to about 50 % of the population
could work from home if necessary. We suppose that in the pre-pandemic phase
“home office” was only used by 5 % with as much as 25-35 % working from
home during different phases of the pandemic [12, pp. 96-101]. With ΦB,W the
pre-pandemic contact patterns at work (Fig. 4, top) and ΦM,W the minimum
contact patterns in simulated lockdown, we can achieve an average contact
reduction of up to rW (ΦB,W − ΦM,W ) with rW ≈ 0.5.

Further contact reduction is induced by people who stop working altogether, so these values have to be subtracted from the pre-pandemic matrix.
We know that about 20 % of the population stopped working in March and
April [12, p. 96]. For the less strict interventions, we assume values of 5-10 %.
3.3.3 School-related interventions.
While working from home is feasible for a larger part of the population, global
school closures and the resulting home schooling “present an unprecedented
risk to children’s education, protection and well-being” [86]. Apart from school
closures, contacts in schools can be reduced by smaller classes where possible,
fixed seating arrangements, regular ventilation, pooled testing [84, 31], and
the general interventions in Section 3.3.1. We will simulate different degrees
of contact reductions in schools.
3.3.4 Other location-related interventions
There are a number of further locations where contact reductions are feasible such as bars and restaurants. Restrictions are also possible for essential
locations like supermarkets or in public transport. To account for this, we will
simulate different scenarios combined with general interventions such as masks
and distancing and regular ventilation of closed spaces.

3.4 Deducing contact patterns from interventions
In this section, we provide the influence of the NPIs on the contact patterns
and commuter rates. Let φB,∗,i,j and φM,∗,i,j denote the mean daily contacts
as shown in Figure 4 in the top and bottom row, respectively, with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 6
for the age groups and ∗ ∈ {H, S, W, O} for the locations.
Since different interventions like working from home and face masks reduce
the mean contacts by sequentially applied multiplicative factors to the remaining contacts, we use a multiplicative definition. For two intervention levels l,
e.g., l = 1 for gathering bans and l = 2 for face masks and distancing, we
(l)
introduce factors r∗,i,j ∈ [0, 1] with l = 1, 2 and ∗ ∈ {H, S, W, O}. We define
the resulting contact patterns as

The factors r∗,i,j corresponding to each intervention are summarized in Table 3. If all factors are set to zero, the baseline contact rate is obtained.
In principle, for the modeling of large events such as carnival or Okto(l)
berfest, we could also increase the contact rates by setting rO,i,j < 0. For

example, taking part in carnival activities raised the infection risk from 9.5 %
to 21.3 % [83]. With the current spread of the disease, these events, however,
are unlikely to take place and are not considered here.
Note that a third level could be used to, e.g., implement particular awareness of senior population. In our simulations, however, including additional
parameters for senior contact reduction always led to underestimations of the
number of deaths.
4 Epidemiological parameters
In this section, we provide interval ranges for the epidemiological parameters
used in our model and lay out how to implement important parameters such
as testing-and-tracing limits.
The main references for each parameter are given in the corresponding
subsection. For certain parameters, we also refer to the derivation in [53].
Furthermore, we derive different parameters in the clinical section of our model
(stages and transitions between I, H, U , D, and R) from the LEOSS study [58].
Some recent results from LEOSS can also be found in [44]. Based on 3 265
hospitalized patients with Covid-19, we provide age-specific mean values and
H
D
confidence intervals for the probabilities µU
H and µU . For the time spans TI ,
R
U
R
D
TH , TH , TU , and TU , we use median values and uniform distributions.
Further, we also use provide distribution fits to the age-resolved time span
data. We considered gamma, Weibull, lognormal, normal, and exponential distributions and fitted according to the lowest Pearson’s cumulative test statistic. The distributions and their parameters are given in the appendix. Note
that the described distributions are of larger interest when using agent-based
models.
4.1 Transmission risk, secondary attack rate
After the number of contacts, the most important factor for the spread of the
disease is the transmission risk ρi , i ∈ {1, . . . , 6}. As mortality is clearly found
to be age-specific for Covid-19 [59], age-dependent susceptibility or transmission is less clear and under discussion [95]. There is, however, evidence showing
odds ratios smaller than 0.5 for children below 15 years compared to adults [93,
28, 36], with an odds ratio of about 0.34 for children compared to adults and
1.47 of seniors above 65 years compared to adults. The meta analysis of [57]
also showed higher susceptibility in adults than in children.
From [41], we find the number of second generation infections divided by
132
. From [80], we
the number of close contacts of the first generation as 2147
know that the secondary attack rate in households was found to be lower than
20 % (in most of the studies) and thus even lower in general (non-household)
settings. From [11] and the first cases of Germany, we have a secondary attack rate of 5-10 %. The meta analysis in [57] found a pooled secondary attack rate in household settings of 18 % and of 0-5 % in workplace, school

or social settings. Taking relative susceptibility as described before into ac(0)

count and adding uncertainty, we have ρ1 ∈ [0.02, 0.04], ρi ∈ [0.05, 0.07],
(0)
i =∈ {2, 3, 4}, ρ5 ∈ [0.08, 0.10]. From the mortality for Germany, we derived

that a slightly larger ρ6 ∈ [0.15, 0.20] had to be used to account for many
infection clusters in residential homes for the elderly [73]. Then, we define
(0)

ρi = sk (t)ρi ,

i ∈ {1, . . . , 6}

(14)

with the seasonality factor sk (t) given in the next section in eq. (15). By this
parameter, we take the influence of seasons into account, a factor that is still
under discussion in the literature [81, 24]. We will allow for a slight variation
of the infection rate with the seasons as detailed in the next subsection.

4.2 Influence of the seasons
As Covid-19 raged all over the world and did not disappear in the summer
months, only reduced seasonality can be expected. While [24] found that multiple meteorological aspects such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed
influence the spread of the disease, the analysis of over 100 articles in [81]
found only a ”weak modulation effect” so far, with more evidence only to be
expected in 2021.
However, another important aspect of seasons is the transition from outdoor to indoor contacts. While counter-strategies like face masks [88,70, 25] or
adapted air flows [8], or both [21,20] are studied, it is reasonable to assume
that they cannot fully waive the risk of indoor infections. In [69], the large
majority of considered clusters appeared in closed environments, while [65]
even quantified the risk of indoor infections 18.7 times larger than the risk of
open-air infections. Additionally, [21, 20] gave particular “maximum exposure
times” for different indoor settings. As we do not distinguish between contacts
in closed spaces and in outdoor spaces, we allow the infection rate ρ (cf. (14))
to vary slightly with the seasons by using
 
sk (t) := 1 + k sin π

,

(15)

where t is the day of the year and k ∈ [0.1, 0.3]. The chosen parameter k will
yield scenarios with modest seasonal influences. From the simulation results,
we will see that the integrated seasonality is capable of reproducing low and
only modestly increasing numbers of infections to the end of the summer period
given only mild restrictions on contact reductions. On the other hand, we can
also correctly model the recent horizontal development of detected cases with
stricter NPIs in autumn and beginning of winter scenarios. For more details,
see Section 5.

4.3 Quarantine and Isolation
Note that we use the parameter β̃ (or β̃i ) differently than the β in the most
recent version of [53]. In the latter, β represents the risk of infection from
the detected and infected symptomatic patients not yet effectively isolated. It
varies within countries, cultures and healthcare systems and is assumed to be
in the range of [0.05, 1.0] [53].
The parameter β̃ in our model additionally represents the share of infected
people IX that are not detected. For comparison, suppose I = IX + IH + IR ,
i.e. the infected are the sum of the undetected IX , those later hospitalized IH
and those that recover on their own IR . Then, our β̃ and β in [53] are related
by
β̃I = (IX + β(IH + IR ))
⇔ β̃ = (IX /I + β(IH + IR )/I)
A value of β̃ = 0.5 could then mean that the number of unreported cases
IX equals the number of reported cases IX = IH + IR = I/2, and reported
cases are perfectly quarantined from the first moment of infection (β = 0)
while nonreported cases move freely for the whole time of infection. Of course
this is only the very unlikely edge case. In reality, detected individuals are
neither detected nor isolated from the very point of symptoms onset while
also undetected individuals may isolate themselves due to their symptoms.
The decrease of β̃ is what the national strategy [71] of test, trace, and
isolate majorly contributes to [27]. Unfortunately, we already faced “no longer
traceable transmission chains” [74]. Since it is difficult to quantify how phases
of relative transmission control or “diffuse spread” [74] influence β̃, we assume
β̃ ∈ [0.1, 0.5] and consider different scenarios. Thereby, we let β̃ increase along
a sigmoidal (cosine) curve from the minimum in [0.1, 0.3] to the maximum
value in [0.3, 0.5]. We assume the minimum value for phases with less than 50
infections per 100 000 individuals increasing smoothly to the maximum value
for cases of about 250 infections per 100 000 individuals.
4.3.1 Exposure, carrier, and infection transition
TEC denotes the time elapsed between exposure and carrier state and TCI the
time between the beginning of carrier state and the onset of symptoms. We
assume that these parameters do not depend on age. TEC represents the latent
period, namely the time an individual remains in a latent non-infectious stage
following the transmission. The incubation period is the time between exposure
and when symptoms are first apparent, i.e.
incubation period = TEC + TCI .

(16)

We use an incubation period of 5.2 days and assume that infections occur
randomly during the infectious period [53]; for more details, see [53,64, 94].
We allow for TEC ∈ [2.67, 4.00]. Hence, by median, TEC = 3.2 and TCI = 2.

4.4 Asymptomatic individuals
During the early outbreak in Germany, a proportion of 22 % of infections was
reported to be asymptomatic [83]. Two recent meta analyses [22, 14] found
ranges of asymptomatic cases from 3-67 % with an overall estimate of 17 %
and 20 %, respectively. The role of children is still heavily under discussion,
and the number of asymptomatic cases in children is even less clear [48, 22,28,
95]. For instance the studies [28,95] considered children diagnosed with SARSCoV-2 infection. The former found 28 % of asymptomatic cases compared to
12 % in adults, and the latter found 19 % with another 25 % of mild cases. We
R
thus consider µR
C,i ∈ [0.20, 0.30] for i = 1, 2 and µC,i ∈ [0.15, 0.25] for i > 2.
While the asymptomatic individual remains infectious, we assume
1
TCR = TCI + TIR ;
2

(17)

for more details, we refer to [53].

4.5 Symptomatic individuals
Symptomatic cases are divided into those with mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization and those where an initially mild stage becomes severe.
From [72], we have a range of 5 % to 22 % of hospitalized cases with respect
to the reported number of cases in Germany. The highest number in the report occurs during a time of presumed huge underreporting and when also
many elderly people were infected. In [87] and its adjusted version for Great
Britain [34] the symptomatic cases range from about 0 % for age group 0-9
to 18 % and 27 %, respectively, for people older than 80 years. We range our
samples accordingly and allow for a deviance of up to 20 % from the mean or
median; see Table 2.
For the recovery time TIR of mild cases, we take a median of about seven
days [90,53] With a deviance of up to 20 %, we consider a range TIR ∈ [5.6, 8.4].
For the time span TIH of initially mild symptoms becoming severe and where
hospitalization is needed, we assume TIH ∈ [9, 12] for patients aged 0-34 years
and TIH ∈ [5, 7] for individuals older than 35 years. In [53], we refer to some
earlier studies [32, 54, 42] providing a median period of 4, 4.9 and and 7 days,
respectively. From [58] and 3 265 patients, we have a median time of known
infection to hospitalization of 9 days for age group 0-14 and 12 days for age
group 15-34, and 6 days for 35-65 years, 7 days for 65-75 years, and 5 days for
75+ years; see Figure 16. Note that the time of known infection, however, only
provides a lower bound for the time of symptoms onset to hospitalization.

4.6 Hospitalized individuals and and transfer to intensive care
In our model, there are essentially two possibilities for patients which are
admitted to a hospital. Either individuals recover directly in the hospital or
individuals are transferred to intensive care units with probability µU
H.
In an early study [89], 26 % of hospitalized patients needed intensive care
which comes close to the 25 % reported in [50]. In our analysis of LEOSS [58],
we see an increase from no cases or only a few for the youngest individuals to
37 % for the age group 66-75 years, with a surprising slight decrease to 24 %
for the age group 80+. In contrast, [34] provides a monotonous curve from
5 % to 70 %. Combining the results, we let µU
H range from 0.05 to 0.45 for the
different age groups; see Table 2 for details.
U
The median time from symptoms onset to intensive care (TIH + TH
) is
estimated to be 9 and 9.8 days in [32, 54] (with a median of 4 and 4.9 days
from symptoms onset to hospitalization, i.e., TIH ). From [58], we derive hospital
stays for patients admitted to ICU (and recovering later on) of 11.3 to 8.4 days
on average (median 13 to 5 days). This includes, however, days before and after
intensive care; see Figure 17. Combining these results, we consider a range of
U
3 to 7 days for TH
for all age groups.
R
of individuals recovering in the hospital without needing
For the time TH
intensive care, we refer to our reasoning in [53] where 7-16 days were considered. From [58] and Figure 18, we have median recovery time spans of 4 to
6 days for age groups 0-14 and 15-35 years, respectively. This value rises to
8 days for 36-65 years, 10 days for 66-75 years, and 15 days for 76 years and
older.

4.7 Intensive care, recovery and death.
At last, we have to determine the mortality µD
U of patients in intensive care
and the patients’ average time spans to either recovery (TUR ) or death (TUD ).

For µD

The mortality among mechanically ventilated patients is considered in [50]
and ranges from 28 % to 72 % from the youngest to the oldest age group.
For non-ventilated patients, these numbers range from 1 % to 34 %. From
the LEOSS survey [58], we have ICU mortalities of 0 %, no cases, or large
confidence intervals around low values for the youngest individuals, increasing
up to 57 % for patients aged 76 years and older; cf. Figure 6.
The recovery time TUR for severe or critical cases can take up to 3-6 weeks [92,
53]. In [54], the pooled median from symptoms onset to recovery was 18.3
days. However, this also potentially includes mild cases. From the LEOSS survey [58], we have mean recovery time spans of 6 and 11 days (median: 7 and 7
days) for people between 0-14 and 15-35 years. For older people, the average
time spans are 17, 21, and 15 days (median: 14, 18, and 9 days); see Table 2
for the ranges used in our simulations.
The pooled time span TUD from symptoms onset to death is estimated as
15.9 days in [54]. In our database from [58], no death is observed for individuals
aged 0-14 years. For the age groups, 15-35, 36-65, 66-75, and 76 and more years
we have mean values of 12, 18, 18, and 12 (median: 15, 16, 15, 9). In [53], we also
assume TUD to be slightly shorter than TUR . For the ranges finally considered
in our simulations, see Table 2.

5 Results
In this section, we present different scenarios based on the course of the pandemic in Germany. Four of these scenarios are retrospective and start at June
1, July 15, September 1, and October 10, respectively, and they last for a period of 45 days. Twelve scenarios are considered for the time span of December
12 to January 10, in particular focusing the Christmas holidays. Our aim is
to qualitatively capture the trend of infections and their time-dependent distribution across Germany. We use the same set of epidemiological parameters
for every scenario without adapting them for the specific situation. We only
implement different sets of interventions that lead to different rates of contact reductions. The mean effectiveness of the sets of NPIs is derived from
the development of SARS-CoV-2 infections and Covid-19-related deaths in
Germany.

5.1 Aims and Expectations
Our first aim is to qualitatively capture the infection trends and death rates for
all scenarios without tweaking specific parameters for a better local fit. We
thus do not expect to exactly predict the number of deaths or infections for
all scenarios. We rather expect slight under- and overshoots depending on the
scenario and the quality of the underlying data. The simulation times in the

Assessment of effective mitigation and prediction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2

retrospective scenarios are rather long and we know that predictions for many
weeks become increasingly less reliable. We do not expect that this is different
for our model. What we want to see here is that our model reproduces the
main trend.
The prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infections or related deaths is a challenging
task and heavily depends on the input data. Our model is age-resolved, but
some of the input data is not. While already relatively good data is available
from RKI [43] and DIVI [66], additional data may be necessary to further
validate our simulations. For the deaths reported with age resolution, only the
dates of the assumed infection are available in the repository [43], and we thus
have to extrapolate the time of death from the time of infection in the real
data. This is then only an approximation to the real life situation and at times
this extrapolated number differs considerably from the overall number given
in the daily situation reports. The overall number in the situation reports,
however, is not age-resolved and not easily accessible by automation. ICU
occupancy also lacks age resolution, so we have to extrapolate intensive care
for the different age groups. On top of that, the underlying data that we
compare to is uncertain as well. The next step would be to further vary that
as well over the different simulation runs.
A further approximation in our model is that people can only die after
they were in intensive care first; cf. Figure 1. In real life, and in particular
in times of high infection rates, Covid-19-related deaths can also happen in,
e.g., residential homes for elderly care. This leads to an overestimation of ICU
occupancy in our model.
Our second aim is to capture the regional spread of the infection across
Germany. Our model must be able to predict the spread of the virus along
the routes provided by our mobility data. We want to observe that local hot
spots affect their neighbouring regions over time.
Our model is only calibrated with real data once at the beginning. Hence,
local effects are very hard to capture in the simulation. For example, in the
real world, the implemented local NPIs in regions with very high incidence
might differ considerably in their effectiveness, so that a once local hot spot
will no longer be hot after some time or become even hotter. A further local
driving mechanism of the infection are super-spreading events. As we do not
yet include those as stochastic events in our simulation and since the location
of these events is by nature random, we expect regional deviations between
the simulated scenarios and the extrapolated real data that may, of course,
also influence the global infection spread. However, if local hot spots are already contained in the initial data, we expect to see their spreading to the
surrounding regions.
Our third and main aim is to assess the mean effectiveness of mitigation
strategies. We implement local dynamic NPIs to control hot spots with more
than 200 infections per 100 000 inhabitants. These are used carefully to avoid
overfitting and to not distort the image of the country-wide mitigation strategy. By variation of the country-wide contact reduction over a large number
of simulations runs, the comparison with the extrapolated real data will indi-

cate how the implemented mitigation strategy influences the effective contact
reduction.
5.2 Retrospective Scenarios
For all simulations, we use the ranges for the epidemiological parameters in
Table 2. We run sets of 1000 Monte Carlo runs with different levels of mitigation as available from Table 3. We then identify ranges for the effective
mitigation in the different scenarios by comparing our simulation results to
the real data.
In all scenarios, school holidays are implemented for the corresponding
dates for all federal states. Other than that, we group the most relevant interventions on state level to single dates and consider their mean effectiveness
over periods of multiple weeks in order to avoid overfitting. In the following, for
better readability, we drop the indices i and j of the NPI-related parameters
(∗)
r∗,i,j ; cf. Table 3.
Set of NPIs for June to October. For the time span of June 1 to
September 30, we model rather weak effective contact reductions – in accordance with the lifting of many interventions in the summer period as described
in [17,15] – to reproduce the slow spread of the disease. We assume contact
reductions in the range of 0 to 20 % in home and other locations, a working
from home percentage between 20 and 30 %, up to 5 % of people who stopped
working altogether (also cf. [12]) as well as an additional contact reduction in
all locations by wearing masks and distancing of up to 20 %. These consid(1)
(1)
erations translate to rH ∈ [0.0, 0.2], rW ∈ [0.2, 0.3] + δ with δ ∈ [0.0, 0.05],
(1)
(2)
rO ∈ [0.0, 0.2] with r∗ ∈ [0.0, 0.2], ∗ ∈ {H, S, W, O}; see Section 3.3.1.
In addition, by averaging we implement the partial school closures and
(1)
remote schooling (rS = 0.5) from June 1 until June 15 for all states; after
(1)
that, schools operate as usual with rS = 0 (except for the school holidays on
(1)
federal level, where rS = 1).
From our simulations runs, we assess the effectiveness of the mitigation
strategies in this period on the overall contact reduction by 15 % with schools
open and by 30 % during school holidays.
Set of NPIs for October. From October 1 to October 30 we assume
slightly stricter contact reductions than in the summer based, e.g., on the call
to further attentiveness end of September [19]. We identify slightly increased
(1)
values for contact reduction at home (20 to 40 %, i.e., rH ∈ [0.2, 0.4]) with
increased values for protective interventions such as wearing masks, regular
(2)
ventilation of closed spaces, or distancing (20 to 40 %, i.e., r∗ ∈ [0.2, 0.4],
∗ ∈ {H, S, W, O}). All other NPIs are kept in place as before. The NPIs’ effect
on the median overall contact reduction that we obtained from our simulations
is about 31 %.
Set of NPIs for November. For the time span of November 1 to November 30, stronger restrictions are in place [18]. We assume contact reduction in

homes by 40 to 60 %, a proportion of non-working individuals of 0 to 10 %
plus a proportion of home-working individuals of 20 to 30 %. Since restaurants, bars, and most leisure-related facilities were closed, we model a contact
reduction in other locations by 60 to 80 %. Additional protective effects to
avoid contacts are estimated as 20 to 40 % in homes and schools (since face
masks are less worn in private situations [7,45] and since school contacts are
more difficult to reduce than work or other contacts) and 40 to 60 % in work
and other situations. Through our simulations runs, we assess the effectiveness
of the mitigation strategies in this scenario on the overall contact reduction
with 50 %. This is slightly larger than the estimation of 43 % by [26] but still
far from the reported reduction in spring (63 %) that may have been necessary
to substantially mitigate the spread of the virus.

To summarize, we set rH ∈ [0.4, 0.6], rW ∈ [0.2, 0.3] + δ with δ ∈ [0.0, 0.1],
(1)
(2)
and rO ∈ [0.6, 0.8] . We further assume r∗1 ∈ [0.2, 0.4], ∗1 ∈ {H, S} and
(2)
r∗2 ∈ [0.4, 0.6], ∗2 ∈ {W, O}.
Dynamic and local non-pharmaceutical interventions. In order to
mitigate the spread in local hot spots, we dynamically implement a set of strict
non-pharmaceutical interventions. Once 200 infections per 100 000 inhabitants
and county are reached, an enforced contact reduction is implemented for 14
days. The parameters of this local set of interventions are the sames as the NPIs
(1)
for November described above with the following modifications: rS = 0.25,
(1)
rW ∈ [0.2, 0.3] + δ with δ ∈ [0.1, 0.2], since additional facilities may be closed
(2)
on a local scale, and r∗ ∈ [0.6, 0.8], ∗ ∈ {H, S, W, O}, which is a quite strong
measure for distancing, face masks and other interventions.
Simulation. Our initial conditions are derived from the age-resolved case
data provided by [43]. We take confirmed cases around the start date of our
simulation from which we extrapolate the compartments in eq. (2)-(9) by using
the parameters in Table 2. Based on [66] and our parameters, we extrapolate
age-resolved ICU data. In order to obtain age-resolved ICU data, we slightly
reduce the initial extrapolation of 80+ intensive care cases since too large death
rates occur in the beginning part of the simulation otherwise. We refrained
from further correction of initial extrapolations without having more reliable
data.
Given positive rates of 1 % or less during the summer [75], we assume that
the number of unknown symptomatic infections was very small. Therefore, we
start our simulations on June 1, July 15, and September 1 directly from the
number of confirmed cases. Given the increased proportion of positive tests up
to mid of October, we start the the simulations with a twofold of the confirmed
cases. For each scenario, we run 1000 Monte Carlo runs such that we have a
reliable set of parameters sampled in the given ranges. For the runs, we provide
the median values as well as the percentiles obtained from the simulation runs.
We use a seven day moving average of real world data and extrapolate the day
of death, using the parameters from Table 2.

5.3 Discussion of Retrospective Scenarios
In the following, we discuss the results of the four different retrospective scenarios with the described sets of implemented NPIs over time. We compare
the overall and the age-resolved death rates with the extrapolated real data.
We also compare the overall infection rates and the ICU occupancy. In the
corresponding Figures 7, 9, 11, and 13, we present the median (percentile p50)
and the percentiles ranges from (p05 and p95) as well as p25 and p75 as explained above. Additionally, in the maps of Figures 8, 10, 12, and 14, we
show two snapshots of the regional spread of the infection, where we compare
the extrapolated real data on the left with our simulation on the right. Note
that the scaling of the color bars differs for the scenarios and represents the
relative number of infections per 100 000 inhabitants.

5.3.1 Scenario 1
Our first scenario (S1) is computed 45 days from June 1 onward. During the
summer months, we observe only a slow rise in the infections in the RKI data
and a decrease of ICU occupancy from DIVI (Fig. 7). Both are captured well
with the median of our simulations. The small elevation in the number of infections in June is due to an outbreak of Covid-19 at the Tönnies slaughterhouse
in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. By June 20, the number of infections had exceeded
1 000. As expected, we cannot capture such a stochastic event with our model.
This hot spot and its influence on the neighbouring regions is also missing in
the simulation in the maps of Figure. 8.
Focusing on the first part of June (see the upper part of Figure 8), we
observe further regions that are underestimated by our simulation and some
where it is the other way around. Overall, however, if we omit the parts around

Tönnies, a larger incidence in the RKI data almost always corresponds to a
larger incidence in the simulation data. The parts that are overestimated in
the simulation can often be contributed to our mobility data. This is only an
approximation of the real life mobility and the infection can only spread along
those routes. Worth mentioning is the spread of infections into neighbouring
regions which we can see for Berlin from the middle to the bottom. Due to the
inclusion of mobility, we see that the infection spreads into the near regions
in our simulation (right) as in the extrapolated real data (left). Due to the
longer simulation time, the results on the bottom show further deviation from
the data. The Tönnnies’ affected regions remain underrepresented in the simulation map. But again, we see an overall good agreement with the infection
spread observed in the real data.
In Figure 7, we plot the median death rate, the percentiles and the extrapolated real data for the different age groups. Our model is quite close to

the overall death rate. The age group 60-79 years is captured very well and
the age groups below are also captured well. We are a little less close for the
age group 80+ years. The deviations are to be expected since we aim for an
overall good fit of our model without tweaking it for the individual scenarios.
Additionally, we lack age-resolved ICU occupancy data and have to extrapolate the intensive care input data for the different age groups. This then also
affects the simulated death rates. Note that the age groups below 15 years only
contribute marginally to the death rate. The deviance with simulation seems
large, but due to the small numbers (0 or 1), we are actually close to the real
world value.

5.3.2 Scenario 2
Our second scenario (S2) is computed 45 days from July 15 onward. The
results of this Scenario are very similar to the results of S1. This holds for the
overall death rates and the death rates in the different age groups as depicted
in Figure 9. A main difference is the influence of travel returners [76] that
might be responsible for the rise of infected in the beginning of August with
a plateau reached at the end of that month; cf. Fig. 9. Such an influence is
not considered in our simulation which contributes to the underestimation of
infections. Similarly, we underestimate the number of ICU occupancy.
In addition to travellers, many smaller outbreaks in a number of administrative districts in various settings (social, industrial, etc.) are reported [76].
There is an increasing trend in 7-day incidences in North Rhine-Westfalia
(NRW) and Hamburg and higher-than-average 7-day incidences in Hesse and
Berlin, as well as a Covid-19 related outbreak in the Bavarian district of
Dingolfing-Landau (DL) with > 400 cases. This is what we observe in the
map of the extrapolated real world data on the left hand side of Figure 10.
In our simulation on the right hand side, NRW still seems to be a little
underrepresented, but interestingly, we catch the outbreak in DL with our
input data from July 15, as well as its spread to neighbouring regions that we
also observe in the real data. Hesse and Berlin are regions of higher infection
rates in our simulation as well. Some local hot spots, maybe due to weddings
in that time, are again missed due to their stochastic nature. All in all, the
qualitative regional infection spread is again captured well.
5.3.3 Scenario 3
Our third scenario (S3) is computed 45 days from September 1 onward. Compared to S1 and S2, we overestimate the number of deaths for all age-groups
(Fig. 11) compared to the extrapolated real data. However, by the end of this
period, on October 15, we also have 9710 deaths reported in the RKI daily
situation report [77]. This means that some of the infected died earlier then
we could extrapolate from the assumed day of infection in [43]. 9710 deaths is
then already much closer to the prediction of our simulation.
The slight overestimation of deaths is consistent with the projected infection numbers and ICU occupancy that are overestimated as well. As the
proportion of positive tests grew considerably from 0.7 % to 5.6 % in the
considered period, we assume that there might have been a larger number of
undetected cases at the end of this scenario which are not reflected in the real
data yet. As explained in Section 5.1, we expect our model to rather overestimate ICU occupancy in phases of high infection rates. This might also already
contribute to the overestimation we observe in Figure 11.
Our simulations from September 1 predict larger incidences in multiple federal states like Bavaria, North Rhine-Westfalia, Berlin, Lower Saxony, BadenWürttemberg, or Rhineland Palatinate with lower incidence in the center and
North Eastern part of Germany; see Figure 12 (right). Although we have a

qualitatively similar picture in the extrapolated real data, the number of reported cases are substantially below the predicted values; see Figure 12 (left).
On the other hand, we see that these and even much higher incidences are to
be found in the real data in October in these precise regions; see Figure 14
(please pay attention to the different scales in these two figures). This further
supports our assumptions that there might be a larger number of undetected
cases in the infections that are not captured in the real data in Figure 12 (left).
5.3.4 Scenario 4
Our fourth scenario (S4) is computed 45 days from October 15 onward. Due
to the increased proportion of positive tests, we start this simulation with
the assumption of twice as many confirmed cases, which is also the reason
for the difference between the infected in the real data and the simulation
data in the initial phase depicted in Figure 13. We see that the curve of
predicted deaths is steeper in the beginning while the extrapolated real data
curve becomes steeper towards the end of the scenario; see 14. As in the
last scenario, the situation reports already yields 16 248 deaths at the end of
November [78], but again the corresponding age-resolved data that we need to
compare to is not directly available. In this scenario, we overestimate the sum
of the extrapolated deaths while we still underestimate the overall number of
16 248 in the situation report.
While we see a slight decrease in reported cases towards the end of November, our model instead predicts a slight but further increase of infections; see
Figure 13. This predicted increase is however consistent with the increasing
number of confirmed cases in the beginning of December; cf. [73].
The slight decrease in confirmed cases end of November is likely to be a
statistical artifact obtained due to a changed test strategy that has been in
place in Germany since November 11 [79]. After that, the conducted PCR
tests fell by around 200,000, while the positive rate rose from 7.86 percent to
nine percent. Again, the curve of predicted intensive care patients lies above
the extrapolated data. Our model thus shows the expected behaviour in times
of higher infections.
5.3.5 Summary of retrospective results
All in all, we have reached our aims: The median of our death and infection
rates is close to the extrapolated real data without further adaptations for
each individual scenario. We can identify the mean effectiveness of the sets of
non-pharmaceutical interventions during different phases of the pandemic in
Germany. Although we have no mechanism to predict local stochastic superspreading events, we see how commuter activities lead to the spread of the
disease along the routes visualized in Figure 2 (right). We can show how the
commuter activities transfer the spread of local hot spots into their surrounding regions and we can predict regions with larger incidence over time spans
of several weeks.

5.4 Predictive Scenario
We present twelve prospective scenarios for Germany from December 12 to
January 10. In these scenarios, we assess different strictness and compliance
levels in relation to the recently announced lockdown [16]. We assume that the
strictness of the lockdown, the strictness of the partial lifting of the lockdown
over Christmas, and the number of infected individuals (detected & undetected) will have the most influence on the effective mitigation and prediction
of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in that period.
Our aim is to predict the infected individuals in Germany from December
12 to January 10 while applying a strict lockdown from December 16 onward.
We assume an effective contact reduction of this lockdown of 74 % or 67 %.
From December 12 to December 16, we use the same contact reduction (50 %)
as in our November scenario in Section 5.2. In our scenarios the lockdown
restrictions are lifted for December 24-26 with contact reductions as given in
Figure 15. Our predictions are based on an assumed initial number of undetected cases on December 12, namely 50 % and 150 %. Since the effects on the
number of deaths through contact reduction in this period will only be seen
from mid of January onward, we do not provide predictions for the number of
deaths.

5.5 Discussion of Predictive Scenarios
In Figure 15, we present scenarios considering contact reductions of 74 % and
67 % during lockdown with different increases in contact rates over Christmas.
The scenarios on the left assume 50 % of undetected infections while the
scenarios on the right assume 150 % of undetected infections on December 12.
Qualitatively, the curves in Figure 15 are similar for both proportions,
50 % (left) and 150 % (right), of undetected infections, but the number of
infections differ considerably. We see that the strictest measures with 74 %
contact reduction (CR) during lockdown and 74 % (green) or 52 % (orange)
reduction over Christmas lead to the lowest number of infections by January
10. With a contact reduction of 67 % during the lockdown and over Christmas
(brown), the number of infections also declines, but not to the same extent as
in the green or orange scenario. The purple curve (52 % CR over Christmas)
behaves to the brown scenario as the orange to the green scenario. If we only
achieve 26 % contact reduction over Christmas (blue or red), there will be a
substantial new rise of the number of infections before the lockdown can take
its effect.
We observe that only slight additional contact reductions during lockdown
can substantially change the speed of infection mitigation. Considering a lifting
of restrictions over Christmas to allow for a mean of 7.2 daily contacts (CR
26 %) could throw back the containment of the virus for weeks. Note that
these 7.2 daily contacts cannot be directly translated to persons in a room
but highly depend on further parameters like (the type of) masks, distancing,

ventilation etc. Considering the contact reduction of 52 % which may be closer
to the NPIs in place over Christmas, we see that they also contribute to the
spread the virus but far less than in the 26 % scenario.

6 Conclusion
We have extended the basic SECIR model [53] by age-resolution (Section 2.1)
and added a model to resolve spatial heterogeneity (Section 2.2) using mobility
data from the German Federal Employment Agency [10] and Twitter [85]. A
numerical solution approach for the regional models has been presented in Section 2.3. One important future achievement will be the release of our modular
epidemics simulation software MEMILIO, which is continuously under development [1] and uses the presented model and data. Our open-source software
will also be available via a web front-end that can be used by the public and
decision makers.
We have collected extensive data on epidemiological parameters and conducted own analyses based on patient-specific data; see Section 4. We have run
experiments with different contact reduction factors and thus have identified
parameters for the effectiveness of mitigation during different phases of the
pandemic in Germany.
While age-resolved incidence data is a good starting point, further data
such as daily number of tests per age group, age-resolved hospitalization and
intensive care data would be valuable information to further validate our
model.
In the retrospective scenarios the trends of infections have been reproduced
well with the derived factors on the effective mitigation strategy in Germany.
Local stochastic events such as super-spreading, which are naturally random,
cannot be predicted. However, once infection information is included in the
starting data, we see how commuter activities lead to increased infections also
in surrounding counties. On the other hand, we see that less affected regions
like the center of Germany or Northern and North-Eastern Germany are also

predicted to be less affected by our simulations. Infection clusters as, e.g.,
appeared in large areas of Southern and Western Germany from beginning of
autumn could be reproduced.
Further, we provide prospective scenarios (Fig. 15) for the current lockdown
which differ in their strictness and compliance levels during lockdown as well
as in the change of behavior over Christmas. For either 50 % or 150 % of
undetected cases on December 12, we see some quantitative but no significant
qualitative differences in the development of the scenarios. In the best case
scenario, we expect a reduction of the infection numbers by a factor of up
to two. With less severe restrictions (or less adherence to severe restrictions),
this factor comes down to about 1.4 or 1.3. We see how increased contact
rates (i.e. lower contact reduction numbers) over only three days of Christmas
can substantially slow down the mitigation of the virus spread. If most of the
restrictions are lifted over Christmas, virus containment will be set back by at
least two weeks.
