The effect of smoking on COVID-19 symptom severity: Systematic review
and meta-analysis
Abstract:
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR2-COV-2), and was first identified in Wuhan, China in
December of 2019, but quickly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic. While
some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others
demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship
between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach.

Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase
databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies
reporting smoking status and comparing non-severe and severe patients were included. Nonsevere cases were described as mild, common type, non-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment,
survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and non-survivors.

Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our metaanalysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases
(OR=2.17; 95% CI: 1.37–3.46; P <.001). Additionally, we found an association between the
current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.12–2.05; P <.008). In
10.7% (978/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe
COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65/305) of cases.

Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe
COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at
risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SAR2-COV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. It
has subsequently spread across the world, causing a global pandemic. This highly contagious
disease has thus far infected 5.2 million people worldwide and killed approximately 337000
patients, yielding a case fatality rate (CFR) that varies between 0.7 and 12.7% (average:
6.4%).[1,2]

COVID-19 primarily targets lung epithelial cells, causing viral pneumonia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially in elderly patients. Therefore, mortality is
higher in the elderly and in patients with at least one accompanying comorbid disease.[3] In
the last report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Institute, the
incidence of respiratory disease was 9.2% in patients diagnosed with a severe COVID-19
clinical course.[4] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are also
common comorbidities in severe cases and are reported in 10.8% and 17.0%, respectively, of
hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with COVİD-19.[5]
However, it has been reported that COVID-19 progresses more severely in COPD patients.[6]
Given that smoking plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis of COPD, it may have a
similar effect on symptoms. In a recent meta-analysis of smoking and COVID-19 severity,
smoking was found to not increase the severity of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 1.69; 95% Cl:
0.41-6.92). However, only five studies were included in this meta-analysis, and heterogeneity
among the studies was low (I2 = 38%).[7]

In another meta-analysis involving more studies, COVID-19 severity was found to increase
with smoking (OR, 1.97; 95% Cl: 0.95-4.10).[6] To increase the statistical power of this
analysis, case reports and series were also included, not just case-control studies. As
previously, the heterogeneity of the studies included here was also low (I2=44%).[6] The
different results of both meta-analyzes create confusion about the issue of smoking status.
Given diverging findings in the existing literature, we systematically reviewed Englishlanguage studies to investigate whether smoking was associated with a more severe clinical
course of COVID-19.

Material and Methods
All guidelines listed in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta
Analyses (PRISMA) statement were followed in conducting this meta-analysis.[8] Our
methodological systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled case-control studies were
recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews
(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero; registration number: CRD42020180173).

Study search strategy
We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to
identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion here. Only English-language articles published
between December 2019 and April 15, 2020 were included. Case series/reports,
commentaries, reviews, and editorial letters were excluded. Unpublished articles were not
searched, but “ahead of print” and “first only” articles with a DOI link in the given database
were included. The following search terms were used: “COVID-19,” OR “SARS-COV-2,”
OR “novel coronavirus (nCOV),” AND “smoking,” OR “tobacco,” AND “clinical features,”
OR “characteristic,” AND “severity,” OR “severe”.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) studies that examined COVID-19 patients older than 18
years and diagnosed COVID-19 according to WHO criteria; (ii) observational, crosssectional, prospective, or retrospective studies; (iii) studies which compared smokers with
mild and severe COVID-19; (iv) studies comparing smokers with survivors and non-survivors
of COVID-19; and (v) studies comparing smokers who developed COVID-19 that required
intensive-care unit (ICU) and non-ICU treatment.

Exclusion criteria were as follow: (i) studies from the same medical center that did not
contribute to meta-analysis, (ii) non-English-language studies; (iii) case reports/series; (iv)
reviews; (v) editorial letters; (vi) studies lacking a full-text (unavailable or not yet published);
(vii) studies without a DOI; and (viii) studies with small sample sizes (<50 patients) because
of low statistical power.

Data extraction
A researcher (AG) scanned study titles and abstracts obtained via an initial database search
and included relevant ones in a secondary pool. Next, two independent researchers (AG and
BU) evaluated the full text of these articles to determine whether they met study inclusion
criteria. Any disputes were resolved by discussion and negotiation with a third investigator
(BAY). Agreed-upon studies were included in the final meta-analysis.
The following data were obtained from all studies: title, first author, publication year,
location, sample size, age (median), history of smoking (former or current), and distribution
of non-severe or severe COVID-19 status. Given these groups, we were able to compare nonsevere (mild, common type, non-ICU, survivors) and severe (critical, severe, ICU, nonsurvivors) COVID-19 cases.

Risk of bias (quality) assessment
Two researchers (BAY and BU) evaluated the collected articles using the Newcastle-Ottawa
scale (NOS) for study quality and risk of bias.[9] This scale evaluates three aspects of each
study: (i) selection (0 to 4 points), (ii) comparability (0 to 2 points), (iii) and detection of the
outcome of interest (0 to 3 points). According to obtained total score, study quality was rated
as follows: 0-3 points (poor), 4-6 points (intermediate), and 7-9 points (high). Studies with a
high risk of bias were excluded during the meta-analysis phase.

Statistical analyses
OpenMeta Analyst version 10.10 (https://www.cebm.brown.edu/open_meta) was used to
calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, which are depicted using forest plots.
Quantitative numbers were measured in terms of total numbers and percentages (n, %). The
odds-ratio of smokers among non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 cases, as well as
survivors and non-survivors, were calculated. Heterogeneity was evaluated with Cochran’s Q,
χ², and the Higgins I² test. The Higgins I2 test uses a fixed effects model when I2 <50%, and a
random effects model when I2 >50%. When heterogeneity was detected, a sensitivity
adjustment was made to determine its source. This procedure was performed by leaving one
study out of the analysis at a time, with a fixed effects model used after excluding
heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated with Statsdirect version 3.2.10 (StatsDirect Ltd,
Cambridge, UK) and visualized using Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s test. P-values (twosided) were considered statistically significant if P <.05.

Results
Our initial search of international databases using the keywords described above yielded 265
articles. After duplicate articles were excluded, 197 articles remained. After article titles and
abstracts were evaluated for appropriateness, a final 34 articles were found to meet study
inclusion criteria. In addition, 18 of the studies for which full texts were obtained were
excluded because they met exclusion criteria. A total of 16 articles met all our criteria. The
relevant PRISMA study flow chart is shown in Figure-1. A quality analysis of the pooled
articles included in this meta-analysis was done by applying NOS. As a result, overall quality
was found to be moderate (NOS score min: 5, max: 8). Results of a quality analysis of the
pooled articles are available in table 1.

Features of the included studies
In the initial meta-analysis pool, 11322 patients with COVID-19 from 16 studies (4, 10-24)
were included. However, given CDC reporting guidelines (4), 525 patients whose
hospitalization statuses were reported as “unknown” were excluded from the final analysis,
yielding a final 10797 patients. Of these, 9414 (87.2%) were non-severe COVID-19 patients,
while 1383 (12.8%) were severe or critical COVID-19 patients who required intensive care.
Among the severe or critical patients, smoking prevalence ranged from 3.6-19.9% (average:
8.4%). While nine studies provided current smoker information, three provided both current
smoker and former smoker information and seven provided only historical smoking
information. All of the included studies were retrospective (six multicenter and 10 singlecenter). A summary of the studies included in this meta-analysis is available in table 2.

History of smoking and COVID-19 severity
The prevalence of smoking among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 was 493/9414
(5.2%), while among severe and critical cases it was 173/1383 (12.5%). A meta-analysis
revealed a significant relationship between smoking history and severe COVID-19 (random
effect model, OR=2.17; 95% CI:1.37–3.46; P <.001) (Table-3). A funnel plot was used to
evaluate publication bias and revealed substantial heterogeneity between the pooled studies
(I2=71.4%; P <.001) (Figure 2b). A sensitivity analysis conducted after removing two studies
(Qi D et al.[16] and Zhang R et al.[23]), which were primary causes of heterogeneity, revealed
that smoking was significantly related to COVID-19 severity (fixed effect model, OR=1.85;
95% CI:1.50–2.29; P <.001) (Figure 2c). Furthermore, this updated analysis had low

heterogeneity (I2=40.6%; p=.06), while a funnel pilot and Egger’s test revealed no publication
bias (tau2=-0.87, P =.16) (Figure 2d).

Smoking status and COVID-19 severity
Only 10 of the pooled studies provide information about current smoking, specifically
(n=305). Current smoking prevalence in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 was
229/7850 (2.9%), while in severe or critical cases it was 65/1134 (5.7%). However, in 10.7%
(978/9067) of non-smokers, COVID-19 disease was severe, while in active smokers it was
severe in 21.2% (65/305) of cases (Table-4). This clearly demonstrates a significant
relationship between current smoking and severe COVID-19 patients (fixed effect model,
OR=1.51; 95% CI:1.12–2.05; z=2.65; P =.008), with an approximate 1.5-fold increased risk
of ICU admission, symptom, severity and mortality in smokers (Figure 3a). In this analysis,
we used a fixed effect model due to the low level of heterogeneity (I2=48.9%; P =.04). A
funnel pilot and Egger’s test revealed no publication bias (tau2=0.22, P =.77) (Figure 3b).
A sensitivity analysis conducted after removing one study (Zhang R et al.[23]) revealed a
similar relationship with severe COVID-19 (fixed effect model; OR=1.36; 95% CI:1.00-1.87;
p=0.05) and low heterogeneity (I2:34.0%; P =.14) (Figure 3c). A funnel pilot and Egger’s test
further revealed no publication bias (tau2=-0.31, P =.67) (Figure 3d).

Discussion
The present meta-analysis contained 16 studies and revealed that those with a history of
smoking and active smokers had significantly increased risk for severe COVID-19. Previous
studies have reported a similar result.[14,18,23] In addition, one prior meta-analysis reported that
disease severity increased given a history of smoking (OR: 1.98).[6] Our analysis adds to this
growing consensus in the literature, invoking more studies and examining both a history of
smoking and current smoking status in risk for increased COVID-19 severity.

Five prior studies have reported results which disagree with those presented here—namely, no
significant difference between patients with and without a smoking history in terms of
COVID-19 severity.[10,15,21,22,24] In addition, a meta-analyses performed by Lippi et al.[7] failed
to find a relationship between active smoking and severe COVID-19 on Chinese patients, and
another meta-analysis indicates that active smoking is not a predisposing factor for
hospitalization.[25] First of all, both meta-analysis[7,25] was not systematic, and included no
assessment of publication bias or study quality. As such, it should be considered only

preliminary. Hence, the present systematic meta-analysis offers a more detailed view as it
covers 16 studies. The heterogeneity was low to moderate and, after sensitivity adjustments,
the prevalence of a history of smoking was found to be 5.2% in non-severe COVID-19 cases
and 12.5% in severe cases. Furthermore, the prevalence of active smoking was 2.9% in nonsevere COVID-19 cases and 5.9% in severe cases. Therefore, severe COVID-19 was observed
almost 1.5 to 2 times more frequently in history of smoking and current smoking groups.
There are studies[4,11,14,16,18,23] and meta-analysis[6,26-34] results supporting this finding.

In addition, a recent meta-analysis revealed that active smokers are at higher risk of mortality
and serious complications.[27] Interestingly, this meta-analysis indicated that serious
complications were observed in 48% of former smokers and 24% of current smokers during
COVID-19 course.[27] This appears to be because former smokers have longer exposure times
or accompanying diseases such as COPD due to smoking. This issue was explained recently
in a rapid non-systematic meta-analysis conducted by Guo FR, which showed that COPD
increased the development of severe COVID-19 by 4.38 times.[28] These findings are
supported by another rapid non-systematic meta-analysis, suggesting that smoking increases
severity and mortality of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.[29] In addition, history of
smoking has been reported to increase the progression of COVID-19 disease.[30] There is
growing evidence to support WHO's statements that 'smokers are at a higher risk of
developing severe COVID-19 and consequent death.[31] It seems very clear that the pandemic
period is an opportunity to quit smoking due to the possibility of encountering worse clinical
outcomes and complications in patients with smoking history.[32]

The relationship between smoking and illness severity due to other respiratory viruses has
been investigated previously. In one recent study, COPD patients who smoked had decreased
leukemia inhibitory factor levels during respiratory syncytial viral infection, particularly
during exacerbations, which may have contributed to lung tissue injury.[35] In addition,
smoking may reduce the protective effect of influenza vaccines in elderly patients and
increase risk of hospitalization.[36] As a result, adverse effects on the lungs in smokers may
aggravate the symptom severity of viral infections.

Furthermore, novel SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 in the lungs
to enter cells and cause infection. In patients using ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin II receptor
blockers (ARBs) for hypertension, upregulated ACE2 expression impacts on disease course

remains unclear. However, the Council on Hypertension of the European Society of
Cardiology does not recommend discontinuation of ACEI and ARB medications for all
patients.[37] The ACE-2 upregulation may increase infectiousness and therefore infection risk,
as the SARS-COV-2 virus uses this receptor for host entry. Paradoxically, it is stated that it
may be useful in protecting people from acute lung injury.[35]

In one recent study, ACE-2 gene expression was up-regulated in the airway epithelium of
COPD patients and active smokers, thereby suggesting a mechanism by which risk for severe
COVID-19 increases in smokers.[39] This upregulation may occur through the α7 subtype of
nicotine acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChR) in people who smoke and consequently
consume nicotine.[40] Therefore, α7-nAChR antagonists (e.g., α-conotoxin,
methyllycaconitine), which may be used to assist with smoking cessation, should be
investigated for their potential impact on ACE-2 expression and thus SARS-COV-2 entry into
the host.[41,42] Furthermore, α7-nAChR and ACE-2 may be potential therapeutic targets, a
topic which requires further investigation.

Common comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes,
and hypertension are associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19.[43] Similarly,
COPD is also associated with a poor clinical progression and poor outcomes despite
treatment, and it was reported that the risk of severe COVID-19 was observed 4 times higher
in patients with pre-existing COPD than in patients without COPD.[6] This may be explained
by systemic and chronic inflammation, diminished respiratory function and capacity, and
COPD-related respiratory failure in some patients. The prevalence of COPD was previously
reported to be 2.8% in non-smokers, 7.6% in former smokers, and 15.2% in active
smokers.[44] Given this, smoking and COPD comorbidity should be considered together as a
single risk factor for severe COVID-19.

Another important point for consideration is that acute respiratory distress syndrome and
cytokine storms, which are seen in some severe COVID-19 patients, are key causes of
mortality in COVID-19. In these patients, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin
(IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, interferon-γ, and TNF-α are elevated, which affect patients
clinical symptoms and severity.[45] Nicotine is a cholinergic agonist that acts via the a7nAChR pathway, and also inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF,
but has no effect on IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine.[46] Therefore, nicotine may be

beneficial for the treatment of severe COVID-19 when delivered via chewing gum,
inhaler/aerosol, or patch.[47,48] This potential therapeutic application should be clarified with
future clinical research, however.

Several factors limit interpretation of the present study. First, the vast majority of studies
included here were retrospective epidemiological studies conducted in China. Second, some
included studies did not distinguish between former or current smoking status. Third, studies
classified COVID-19 cases broadly as follows: (i) mild to moderate: mild, non-severe,
common type, did not require ICU care, and COVID-19 survivors and (ii) severe: severe,
critical, required ICU care, and non-survivors. Given these limitations, caution should be
exercised while interpreting our results. Future studies may respond to these issues by
defining disease severity more clearly and by obtaining more detailed information about
smoking habit.

In addition to classical tobacco smoking behavior, water pipe and electronic cigarette use
should not be overlooked, as these modes of consumption may increase contamination risk
due to repetitive hand interactions with the mouth, carrying cigarette packets in the pockets,
and blowing of smoke. Similarly, exposure to passive smoke can alter ACE-2 gene expression
and cause immune system changes. Naturally, these patients also have the potential to have
severe COVID-19 symptoms, and smoke exposure is a potential risk factor for those around
the patient, including their friends and family.

Future studies should continue to collect nicotine consumption information, including the
number of cigarettes smoked per day, passive exposure, and degree of COPD, and should
evaluate the dynamics of interactions between cigarette smoking and COVID-19. In addition,
the effects of various smoking habits (e.g., mild versus heavy consumption, water pipe use,
and electronic cigarettes use) on the transmission of SARS-COV-2, the clinical severity of
COVID-19, and the clinical progression of COVID-19 should be investigated. Finally, the
relationship between COPD severity and COVID-19, and the potential therapeutic effect of
nicotine on severe COVID patients should also be examined and clarified. In addition,
clinicians can pay more attention to the history of smoking of COVID-19 patients, and more
further research may aim to determine mechanisms that drive or decrease this risk.

Conclusion:
The present meta-analysis revealed that active smoking and a history of smoking are
significantly associated with increased COVID-19 symptom severity. The SARS-COV-2
epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health
practices and discontinue smoking.
