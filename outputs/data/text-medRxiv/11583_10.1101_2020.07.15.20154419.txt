covid-19 in socially clustered population: Can
herd immunity be approached in Sweden?

Abstract
We present a new mathematical model of disease spread reflecting
specialties of covid-19 epidemic by elevating the role social clustering
of population. The model can be used to explain slower approaching
herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other
mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure
of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces
having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are
endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus’
spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to
another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between
them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social
hierarchy’s levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for
the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The
virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers.
This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster
spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard
mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model. We
present socio-medical specialties of the covid-19 epidemic supporting
our purely diffusional model.

Introduction

The covid-19 epidemic has many unusual features (see section 2). One
of them plays the crucial role in disease spread. We formulate it as
the basic assumption of this paper (see also [1]):

AS0 Virus’ spread in population is constrained by the hierarchic
social cluster structure.

How can one model mathematically social clustering of population? In a series of works [2]-[7], we constructed ultrametric clustering
of population by using the system of hierarchically ordered social coordinates and this approach was applied in cognition, psychology, sociology, information theory (see also [8]-[12]). In this paper, we shall
use ultrametric diffusion equation [13]-[21] to describe dynamics of
coronavirus spread in socially clustered population. It is important to
note that ultrametric spaces have treelike geometry, so we shall study
dynamics of virus on social trees. To simplify mathematics, consideration is restricted to homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each
vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic
number fields. We remark that p-adic numbers are widely used in
number theory and algebraic geometry. Their applications to natural
phenomena started with string theory and quantum physics [22]-[24].
The specialties of covid-19 epidemic1 are not reflected in the standard mathematical models [25]-[27], such as, e.g., the canonical SIR
model [28] and its diffusion-type generalizations, e.g., [29]. Consequently, in spite of the tremendous efforts [30]-[36], mathematical
modeling of coronavirus spread cannot be considered as successful.
Therefore, we have to search for new mathematical models reflecting
better the covid-19 specialties. The recent paper [1] based on AS0 can
be considered as a step in this direction. In it, we studied the problem
of approaching herd immunity in countries like Sweden, i.e., without
lock-down. The coronavirus does not spread throughout population
homogeneously as it is described by the standard models of disease
spread. Its spread has the clear social cluster character (cf. with disease spread modeling in articles [37]-[40]). The coronavirus spreads

relatively easy in a social cluster that was infected by somebody, but
approaching other clusters is constrained by social barriers.
Such virus’ spread is described very well by dynamics on energy
landscapes. The latter is well developed theory with numerous applications to statistical physics (e.g., spin glasses) and microbiology [41][47]. An energy landscape is a system of (energy) valleys separated by
barriers of different heights having a hierarchic structure. A system
(physical, biological) can move inside a valley or jump over a barrier
to another valley, with some probability. Thus, the simplest mathematical model is given by random walks on energy landscapes (see,
e.g., [48]). Behavior of random walking depends crucially of grows of
barriers coupled to the hierarchic structure of an energy landscape.
Geometrically the hierarchy of valleys (clusters) of an energy landscape has the treelike structure. As is well known, trees also give
the geometric representation for ultrametric spaces and vice verse.
Thus, dynamics on energy landscapes, collection of clusters separated
by hierarchically ordered barriers, can be represented as dynamics in
ultarmetric spaces.
In the first paper [1] on ultrametric approach to disease spread,
we explored the random walk in ultrametric spaces [48]. Such random walk is the discrete version of ultrametric diffusion. Theory of
diffusion equations in ultrametric space is well developed [13]-[21]. In
the present paper, we apply its powerful mathematical apparatus for
modeling covid-19 spread in hierarchically structured social clusters.
The problem of approaching herd immunity is reformulated in terms
of ultarmetric diffusion equation. We consider a country without lockdown, but, nevertheless, imposing a bunch of social restrictions (barriers) during the covid-19 epidemic. As the basic example, we consider Sweden (see [1], appendix 2 for compact description of situation
in Sweden, March-June 2020, from the viewpoint of imposing social
barriers). This reformulation makes the model mathematically rigorous (studies [41]-[47], [48] were at the physical level of rigorousness)
and opens the door for development of a variety of new mathematical
models of coronavirus spread taking into account the social cluster
structure of population.
For Sweden, this problem of approaching herd immunity is of the
big value. The country did not impose the lock-down and the system
of measures presented by the state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell and
his team was aimed to approach herd immunity and, in this way, to
make essentially weaker or escape at all the second wave of covid19 epidemic and may be proceed without vaccination. However, the
dynamics of population’s immunity against coronavirus is very slow,
essentially slower than it was predicted by Swedish epidemiologists

and by mathematical models of disease spread 2 (see, e.g., [49]-[51] for
reports from Public Health Institute of Sweden, [32]-[34] for attempts
of mathematical modeling and [52]-[56] for reports from massmedia).
As we have seen [1], ultrametric random walk (with jumps over
mild barriers linearly growing with levels of social hierarchy) generates
dynamics with asymptotic behavior of the power type; herd immunity
in a social cluster C grows as pIm (C, t) = 1 − t−q , q > 0. Generally
(but, of course, depending on the parameter q) this function increases
slowly. This asymptotic can explain unexpectedly slow approaching
herd immunity by population of Sweden. The basic parameter of the
model q = T log p/∆. Here T > 0 is the social analog of temperature,
the degree of activity in a society, ∆ is the magnitude of the elementary
barrier for hopping between nearest social levels. Higher social temperature T implies more rapid approaching of herd immunity; higher
social barrier ∆ implies slower growth of herd immunity.
In the present paper, by using results of work [17] on the relaxation dynamics for diffusion pseudo-differential equation on ultrametric spaces we reproduce the power low for dynamics of herd immunity
from [1], for linearly growing barriers. The technique of ultrametric
diffusion equations provides the possibility to study this problem for
other types of barriers as well as for design of more general mathematical models of covid-19 spread, may be even matching quantitatively
with medical data on this epidemic.

Specialties of covid-19 spread

As was emphasized in introduction, covid-19 epidemic has some specialties. To match these specialties, one has to develop new mathematical models. The fundamental specialty is the social cluster character
of coronavirus spread, see AS0. Further, we shall discuss a few other
virus’ features. They justify the following assumption distinguishing
our purely diffusional model of virus spread from the standard SIRtype models:

number of those who have already been infected.

Now we discuss a few biological and social factors behind this feature of the virus.

In particular, by models Tom Britton [32, 33] that was used by Swedish State Health
Authority predicted that herd immunity will be approached already in May; Anders Tegnell also announced, starting from the end of April 2020, that Sweden would soon approach
herd immunity, but it did not happen, neither in May, nor June and July.

• Covid on surface. As was shown in study [58], the probability
to become infected through some surface (say in a buses, metro,
shop) is practically zero. It was found that even in houses with
many infected (symptomatic) people, the viruses on surfaces (of
say tables, chairs, mobile phones) were too weak to infect anybody. (Their were present, but were not able to infect mouths.)3

• Covid in air. The virus is neither so much dangerous at the
open air, especially if people follow the recommendation to keep
1, 5 m distance between them. In in [58] was pointed out: “The
fact that COVID 19 is a droplet infection and cannot be transmitted through the air had previously also been confirmed by
virologist Christian Drosten of Berlin’s Charité. He had pointed
out in an interview [59] that coronavirus is extremely sensitive
to drying out, so the only way of contracting it is if you were to
‘inhale’ the droplets.”

• Asymptomatic individuals. As was recently announced [60],
WOH collected a lot of statistical data showing that asymptomatic individuals transmit covid-19 virus to other people with
very low probability.4 At the same time, US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimates that about a third of coronavirus infections (35%) are asymptomatic [61]. Hence, about
35% of infected people practically do not contribute in disease
spread.

Mr Streeck, a professor for virology and the director of the Institute of virology and
HIV Research at the University Bonn, clarified [58]: “There is no significant risk of catching
the disease when you go shopping. Severe outbreaks of the infection were always a result
of people being closer together over a longer period of time, for example the apré-ski
parties in Ischgl, Austria.” During extended and careful study in Heidelberg (the German
epicenter of the covid-19 epidemic) his team could also not find any evidence of living
viruses on surfaces. “When we took samples from door handles, phones or toilets it has
not been possible to cultivate the virus in the laboratory on the basis of these swabs. ...
To actually ‘get’ the virus it would be necessary that someone coughs into their hand,
immediately touches a door knob and then straight after that another person grasps the
handle and goes on to touches their face.” Streeck therefore believes that there is little
chance of transmission through contact with so-called contaminated surfaces.

“We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact
tracing. They’re following asymptomatic cases, they’re following contacts and they’re not
finding secondary transmission onward. It is very rare – and much of that is not published
in the literature,” Van Kerkhove, WOH official said on June 6, 2020. “We are constantly
looking at this data and we’re trying to get more information from countries to truly
answer this question. It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually
transmits onward.” [60].

• Superspreaders. As for many infections, spread of coronavirus
has the following feature - the presence of superspreaders of infection. One person can infect really many people. Thus, single
person’s contribution in disease spread can be essentially higher
than contribution of a few hundreds of usual asymptomatic individuals or many presymptomatic individuals (see more on superspreaders in Appendix).

AS2 The number of susceptible people S(t) is so large comparing
with the number I(t) of those who are infected or the number R(t)
of recovered that we can consider it as constant, S(t) = const, and
exclude it from model’s dynamical equations.

180
181
182
183

This assumption implies that for an individual in population under
consideration the probability to become infected practically does not
depend on the number of recovered. The population is rather far from
approaching herd immunity and a disease spreader is surrounded (with
the high degree of approximation) by susceptible people. Thus the
number of recovered people R also can be excluded from dynamics. Of
course, this model provdies only the rough picture of the real disease
spread, but it reflects the basic features of the covid-19 spread in
the states that imposed relatively soft restrictions in relation with
epidemic (as, e.g., Sweden, Japan, Belarus).
Denote the probability, for a person from elementary social cluster
x, to become infected at the instance of time t by the symbol pI (x, t).
To write the evolution equation for pI (x, t), we impose the additional assumption:

AS3 The distribution of social clusters in the society is uniform:
all clusters represented by balls of the same radius have the same measure that is equal to balls’ radius.

Mathematically AS3 is formalized through the use of the Haar
measure µ on Qp . We understand that this is a strong restriction on the
social structure of society. But, the main reason for its imposing is just
simplification of mathematics. We can consider other distributions on
Qp assigning different weights to social clusters represented by balls

In Sweden, restaurants and night clubs were open, but such events were not of masscharacter. The presence in a night club or in a restaurant of one infection spreader has
practically the same impact as say 5 spreaders, the effect of closed space. Moreover, the
distance between the tables in restaurants also diminished the effect of high number of
infected in the population. During the intensive phase of the covid-19 epidemic (the end
of March and April 2020) restaurants terminated self-serving during lunches (so typical in
Sweden).

center.)

3 Hierarchic treelike geometry of social clusters
We represent the human society as a system of hierarchically coupled (as a treelike structure) disjoint clusters. There are many ways
for mathematical modeling of such representations. Theory of ultrametric spaces is one of the basic mathematical tools for this purpose.
Geometrically ultrametric spaces can be represented as trees with hierarchic levels. Ultrametricity means that this metric satisfies so-called
strong triangle inequality:
ρ(x, y) ≤ max{ρ(x, y), ρ(y, z)},

for any triple of points x, y, z. Here in each triangle the third side is
less or equal not only the sum of two other sides (as usual), but even
their maximum. Define balls as usual in metric spaces BR (a) = {x :
ρp (x, a) ≤ R}, where a is a center of the ball and R > 0, is its radius.
The balls have the following basic properties:
• Two balls are either disjoint or one of them is contained in another.
• Any point of a ball can be selected as its center, i.e., BR (a) =
BR (b) for any b ∈ BR (a).
Any ball can be represented as disjoint union of balls of smaller
radius, each of the latter can be represented in the same way with even
smaller radius and so on. We get hierarchy of balls corresponding to
disjoint partitions. Geometrically a ball is a bunch of branches of a
tree.
We use the ultrametric balls to represent mathematically social
clusters, any cluster is slit into disjoint sub-cluster, each of the latter
is split into its own (disjoint) sub-clusters and so on. Inclusion relation
generates the hierarchy on the set of social clusters.
In a series of works of the author and his collaborators [2]-[6], ultrametric spaces (geometrically hierarchic trees) were applied for modeling of cognitive, psychological, and social phenomena. This modeling
was based on invention of systems of discrete social (or mental in
cognitive studies) coordinates x = (xm ) characterizing (psycho-)social
states of individuals. The treelike representation of social states is
based on selection of hierarchically ordered social factors enumerated

by index m ∈ Z = {0, ±1, ±2, ...}. (It is convenient to work with coordinates enumerated by integer numbers.) The social importance of
coordinates xm decreases with increase of m and increases with decrease of m; e.g., social coordinate x0 is more important than any
xj , j > 0, but it less important than any xj , j < 0. The coordinate
x0 can be considered as a reference point. Depending on context (say
socio-economic or socio-epidemic) it can be shifted to the right or
to the left. Therefore it is convenient to use positive and negative
indexes determining two different directions of social importance of
coordinates.
We consider discrete social coordinates, generally, for each m, there
Nm possible values, xm = 0, 1, ..., Nm − 1, and Nm can vary essentially
with m. In the treelike representation, numbers Nm determine the
number of branches leaving vertexes. Such trees are complicated and
we restrict modeling to homogeneous trees for that Nm does not depend on m. Moreover, by pure mathematical reasons it is convenient
to select Nm = p, where p > 1 is the fixed prime number. We remark
that the corresponding theory was developed even for arbitrary trees
(ultrametric spaces), but it is essentially more complicated [18, 19].
Thus, a social state x is represented by a vector of the form:
x = (x−n , ..., x−1 , x0 , x1 , ..., xm ), xj ∈ {0, 1, ..., p − 1}.

The vector representation of psychical, mental, and social states is very
common in psychology and sociology. The essence of our approach [2][6] is the hierarchic ordering of coordinates leading to introduction of
ultrametric on the state space, see (5).
For our purpose, modeling of epidemic, we can consider, for example, the following hierarchic system of social coordinates; for simplicity,
let index m = 0, 1, 2, ..., so the coordinate x0 is the most important.
It is natural to use it to denote states (e.g., Sweden, Russia, USA,...);
x1 can be used for age; x2 for chronic diseases, x3 gender, x4 for race,
x5 for the town of location, x6 for the district, x7 for profession, x8
for the level of social activity, x9 for the number of children living
with this person , and so on. We understand that such ranking of the
basic social factors related to the covid-19 epidemic may be naive and
incomplete. The contribution of sociologists, psychologists, and epidemiologists can improve the present model essentially, see even the
recent article [57] on mathematical model of evolutionary creation of
social types and contribution of genetics and natural selection.
Since the majority of states selected the lock down policy that was
not oriented towards approaching herd immunity, we restrict consideration to the Swedish population. So, in the above assigning of social
meaning to coordinates they are shifted to the left. We also stress that

hierarchy of social factors involved in the covid-19 epidemic can be selected depending on the state, i.e., for each state we create its own
system of social clustering coupled to this epidemic. Consider USA,
here the population is not so homogeneous with respect to the level
of income and the life style connected to income as it is in Sweden.
The social factor of belonging to up or low income classes plays the
crucial role in covid-19 infecting. It seems that this coordinate should
be places as the next (to the right) to the age-coordinate, then the
race-coordinate and so on. Thus, the above hierarchy, (age, chronic
disease, gender, race, town, district, family,...), that is appropriate
for Sweden, should be rearranged for USA, as say (age, income, race,
chronic disease, gender, town, district, family,...).6
It is convenient to proceed with variable number of coordinates,
i.e., not fix n and m. This gives the possibility to add new coordinates.
The space of such vectors can be represented by rational numbers of
the form

(3)
This is the basis of the number-theoretic representation of the space
of social states. We shall consider it later. Now we continue in the
vector framework.
To use fruitfully ultrametric models, we have to construct a complete metric space. The standard way is approach completeness is to
consider infinite sequences of the form:

where, for each x, there exists n such that x−j = 0, j > n. Denote the
space of such sequences by the symbol Qp . On this space, a metric is
introduced in the following way. Consider two sequences x = (xj ) and
y = (yj ); let xj = yj , j < n, where n is some integer, but xn 6= yn .
Then the distance between two vectors is defined as

So, if n is negative, then distance is larger than 1, if n is nonnegative,
then distance is less or equal to 1. The ρp is an ultrametric. We remark
that each ball can be identified with a ball of radius R = pn , n ∈ Z.
Ball B1 (0) = plays the important role and it is defined by special
symbol Zp . As in any ultrametric space, each ball is represented as
disjoint union of smaller balls,e.g.,

where aj ∈ Zp is constrained by condition x0 = j and aj0 ...jn−1 is
constrained by conditions x0 = j0 , ..., xn−1 = jn−1 , and so on. We
recall that in an ultrametric space, any point of a ball can be selected
as its center.
In our model, p-adic balls represent social clusters corresponding
to fixing a few social coordinates. For example Cj = B1/p (aj ) = {x ∈
Zp : x0 = j}, in above epidemic coding Cj corresponds to fixing age=
j; Cji = B1/p (aji ) = {x ∈ Zp : x0 = j, x1 = i}, age= j, gender = i for
Swedish society or age= j, income level= i for American society.
Social states, points of Qp , can be cosnidered as balls of zero radius, we call them elementary social clusters. Partitions of a ball into
disjoint balls of smaller radii corresponds to partition of a social cluster
into disjoint subclusters of deeper level of social hierarchy.
Now we turn to the algebraic representation of social states by
rational numbers, see (3). The space Qp endowed with ultrametric ρp
can be considered as completion of this set of rational numbers and
algebraically the elements of Qp can be represented by power series of
the form

where xj ∈ {0, 1, ..., p − 1}, xn 6= 0, and n ∈ Z; so only finite number
of coordinates with negative index k can differ from zero. Such a series converges with respect to ultrametric ρp . Representation by the
power series gives the possibility to endow Qp with the algebraic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (the latter
operation is defined only for prime p). Hence, Qp is a number field,
the field of p-adic numbers. This algebraic representation leads to
number-theoretic representation of ultrametric, ρp (x, y = |x − y|p ,
where x → |x|p is the p-adic analog of the real absolute value; per
definition, for x given by series (7),

Therefore it is interesting to study the evolution of average probability for cluster Bn ≡ Bpn (0), n = 0, ±1, ±2, .... Under assumption AS3,
this quantity is represented as the integral with respect to the Haar
measure:

Under the above assumptions on the social structure of population
and its interaction with the virus (including restrictions imposed by
authorities in connection with epidemic), we can write the following
master equation for probability pI (x, t),
Z
∂pI (x, t)
[p(x|y; t)pI (y, t) − p(y|x; t)pI (x, t)]µ(dy),
(11)
=
∂t
Qp
where p(x|y; t) is the transition probability: the probability that the
virus being present in (elementary) cluster y would jump to cluster x.
We suppose that this probability does not depend on time t and it is
symmetric, i.e., p(x|y) = p(y|x). Under these assumptions, the master
equation has the form
Z
∂pI (x, t)
=
p(x|y)[pI (y, t) − pI (x, t)]µ(dy).
(12)
∂t
Qp
It is natural to assume that the transition probability decreases with
increasing of the distance between two clusters, for example, that
p(x|y) =

Here Cα > 0 is a normalization constant, by mathematical reasons it
is useful to select distance’s power larger than one. Hence,
Z
∂pI (x, t)
pI (y, t) − pI (x, t)
= Cα

The integral operator in the right-hand side is the operator of fractional derivative Dα (the Vladimirov operator), see [13]. Thus, the
dynamics of the probability to become infected for those belonging
to an elementary social cluster is described by the p-adic diffusion
equation:
∂pI (x, t)
= Dα pI (x, t).
(15)

To formulate the Cauchy problem, we have to add some initial probability distribution. We select the uniform probability distribution
concentrated on a single ball, initially infected social cluster Bn ,

This equation and its various generalizations were studied by many
authors, for applications to physics and biology and by pure mathematical reasons, see, e.g., [13]. We are interested in the relaxation
regime, i.e., asymptotic of average probability pI (Bn , t) for large t.
We use the mathematical result from [17] (see also [18, 19]) and obtain that the average probability has the power behavior:
pI (Bn , t) ∼ t−1/α , t → ∞.

Thus the average probability to become infected in a social cluster
decreases rather slowly with time. If α >> 1, i.e., the virus transition
probability decreases very quickly with increase of the distance between social clusters, then pI (Bn , t) decreases very slowly with time,
it is practically constant. If 0 < α << 1, so the virus transition probability decreases relatively slowly with increase of the distance, then
pI (Bn , t) decreases sufficiently quickly with time. We shall discuss
these behaviors in section 5 by assigning bio-social meaning to the
parameter α.
We present some graphs corresponding to different values of α at
Fig. 1.
Consider now a kind of “integral immunity”, combination of innate
and adaptive components, defined as the probability of not become

5 Virus’ random walk on the hierarchic social tree
The mathematical result on the relaxation regime for the p-adic diffusion [17] is generalization of studies on random walks on ultrametric
spaces describing dynamics on energy landscapes [48]-[47]. There are
given energy barriers ∆m separating valleys, movement from one valley to another valley is constrained by necessity to jump over a barrier
between them. This random walk model gives a good heuristic picture of the virus spread, as jumping from one social cluster (valley)

to another, where clusters (valleys) are separated by social barriers
(mountains) of different heights. Geometrically such random walk is
represented as jumps on a tree between the levels of social hierarchy.
Our model (selection of the transition probability in the form (13))
corresponds to barriers growing linearly with the number of elementary jumps. The relaxation regime of the power form is obtained for
the number of hierarchy’s levels approaching infinity, i.e., for ideal
trees with infinitely long branches, as ultrametric spaces they are represented by Qp .

The virus plays the role of a system moving through barriers in
models of dynamics on energy landscapes (see [48], [41]-[47] and references herein). In our case, these are social barriers between social
clusters of population. The virus performs a complex random walk
motion inside each social cluster moving in its sub-clusters, goes out
of it and spreads through the whole population, sometimes the virus
comes back to the original cluster from other social clusters that have

been infected from this initial source of infection, and so on. During
this motion the virus should cross numerous social barriers.
Instead of virus walking through the social tree, we can consider
a person. A person of the social type x can interact with persons of
other social types. The temporal sequence of social contacts of some
persons can have a very complicated trajectory, visiting numerous
clusters (but the probability of approaching a cluster depends crucially
on social barriers).
Let virus encounters a barrier of size ∆m , in hopping a distance m
(crossing m levels of hierarchy), where ∆1 < ∆2 < ... < ∆m < .... It
is supposed that barriers ∆m are the same for all social clusters, i.e.,
they depend only on distance, but not on clusters. This assumption
reflects a kind of epidemic égalit’e of all social groups, the barriers
preventing spread of the virus that are imposed by state authorities
are the same for all social groups.
Consider the tree at Fig. 3. We identify the lengths of branches
between vertexes with magnitudes of barriers. Then the barriers on
this tree depend on clusters, so from this viewpoint the social tree is
not homogeneous.
Consider the energy landscape with a uniform barrier ∆, at every
branch point; that is, a jump of distance 1 involves surmounting a
barrier ∆, of distance 2, a barrier 2∆, and so on. Hence, barriers
linearly grow with distance m,
∆m = m∆, m = 1, 2, ....

446
447
448
449
450
451

It seems that this type of behavior is the most natural from the
viewpoint of social connections during the covid-19 epidemic in Sweden. Barriers are sufficiently high, but they still are not walls as
during the rigid quarantine (as say in Italy, France, or Russia). For
such linearly increasing barriers one can derive the following asymptotic behavior (17) of the relaxation probability [48], where in physics
and biology the parameter
T log p
,
(20)
∆
Here the new parameter T has the meaning of temperature. Thus
behavior of distance between valleys of the energy landscape is determined by the size of the barrier for one-step jump ∆ and temperature.
We rewrite formula (13) for transition probability by using these parameters:
CT,∆
p(x|y) =
.

In our model, we introduce the notion of social temperature T. As in
physics, this parameter calibrates energy, in our case social energy.

The latter represents the degree of social activity, the magnitude of
social actions. Although the notions of social temperature and energy
are not so well established as in physics, they can be useful in sociophysical modeling (see [63] and references herein, starting with the
works of Freud and Jung). Probability that the virus jumps from the
elementary social cluster y to another cluster x grows with growth
of social temperature. For high T, virus (or its spreader) easily move
between social clusters. If T << 1, the infection is practically confined
in clusters. If barrier ∆ increases for the fixed parameter T, then the
transition probability decreases and vice verse.
Starting with expression (21), we obtain the relaxation asymptotic
in the form:
T log p
pI (Bn , t) ∼ t− ∆ , t → ∞.

Thus, for large t, the average probability to become infected in social
cluster Bn decreases quicker with increase of social temperature T.
Decrease of the one-step jump barrier ∆ implies the same behavior.
Immunity probability pIm (Bn , t) behaves in the opposite way. It
increases quicker with increase of social temperature and decrease of
the social barrier ∆.

Concluding remarks

In this paper, we continue development of a new mathematical model
of disease spread reflecting specialties of covid-19 epidemic. We especially emphasize the social cluster character of the virus spread, AS0.
Such clustered spread can be modeled with dynamical systems on ultrametric spaces. Social clusters are represented by ultrametric balls.
The basic feature of ultrametric balls is that they are either disjoint
or one is included in another. This is the root of a the hierarchic
structure of an ultrametric space. Geometrically ultrametric spaces
are represented by trees with balls given by bunches of branches with
the common root.
In this paper, we model the dynamics of coronavirus with ultrametric diffusion equation7 , its simplest version corresponding to p-adic
trees and linearly increasing social barriers. Asymptotic of probability pIm (t) to become immune against the virus is presented at Fig. 2.
Generally, it increases slowly, the speed of increasing depends on the
basic parameter of the model q = T log p/∆.

The use of purely diffusional model is supported by specialties of covid-19 epidemic,
presented in section 2. Of course, this model is only approximate. But, it seems that it
gives the right asymptotic of probabilities, to become infected and immune, in socially
clustered society.

In a society with low social temperature and high barriers between
social clusters, pIm (t) increase so slowly that there is practically no
hope to approach herd immunity.

Superspreader is an unusually contagious individual who has been
infected with disease; someone who infected the number of people far
exceeding the two to three. As was pointed out in MIT Technology
Review [62]: “For covid-19, this means 80% of new transmissions are
caused by fewer than 20% of the carriers – the vast majority of people
infect very few others or none at all, and it is a select minority of
individuals who are aggressively spreading the virus. A recent preprint
looking at transmission in Hong Kong supports those figures, while
another looking at transmission in Shenzhen, China, pegs the numbers
closer to 80/10. Lots of outbreaks around the world have been linked
to single events where a superspreader likely infected dozens of people.
For example, a choir practice in Washington State infected about 52
people; a megachurch in Seoul was linked to the majority of initial
infections in South Korea; and a wedding in Jordan with about 350
guests led to 76 confirmed infections.” The bad news is that, for the
moment, we cannot identify diagnostically superspreaders.
