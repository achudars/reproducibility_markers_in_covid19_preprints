COVID-19-related disruptions to routine vaccination services in India: perspectives from
pediatricians
ABSTRACT

Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions to routine immunization
programs in India and around the world, setting the stage for potentially serious outbreaks of vaccinepreventable diseases.

Methods: We surveyed pediatric healthcare providers in India in 2 rounds in April-June and September
2020 to understand how COVID-19 control measures may have impacted routine vaccination.

Results: Respondents were predominantly pediatricians working in primary, secondary or tertiary
healthcare centers, across 21 Indian states and two union territories. Among the 424 (survey 1) and 141
(survey 2) respondents, 33.4% and 7.8%, respectively, reported near complete suspension of vaccination
services due to COVID-19. A 50% or greater drop in vaccination services was reported by 83.1% of
respondents in June, followed by 32.6% four months later, indicating slow recovery of services. By
September 2020, 83.6% were aware of updated guidelines on safe provision of immunization services,
although awareness of specific catch-up vaccination plans was low, and 76.6% expressed concern about
a vaccine coverage gap that could potentially lead to increased non-COVID-19 illnesses and deaths.

Conclusions: Pandemic-related disruptions to vaccination services were reported by pediatricians across
India. Concerted efforts are needed from governing and academic groups to ensure that routine
immunization and catch-up programs are implemented during this pandemic, which can sustain gains in
vaccination coverage and provide a robust blueprint for the national roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine.

BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruption in essential health services, including
routine childhood immunizations[1, 2]. Evidence from previous epidemics have demonstrated
that a temporary interruption of routine immunization services may lead to secondary health
crises, such as outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, amplifying morbidity and
mortality[3]. Global interruptions in income, food supplies, and medical care can leave children
at risk of becoming the unacknowledged victims of the current pandemic. The nationwide
lockdown imposed by the Government of India on 24 March 2020 was formally lifted on 31
May 2020 with states continuing to monitor containment measures as needed. While the
lockdown possibly slowed the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and averted deaths due to
COVID-19[4], it also resulted in concurrent crises in other aspects of health by taking a toll on
healthcare provision and health-seeking activities[5]. Even services deemed as essential,
including vaccination, were limited as a consequence of the lockdown and subsequent
restrictions. India has made tremendous progress in reducing vaccination inequities in recent
years[6]; however, these gains are at risk of being forfeited as a result of pandemic-related
disruptions.
We surveyed pediatric healthcare providers in India at two timepoints to understand how
COVID-19 control measures may have impacted routine vaccination at the peak of the
lockdown and four months after the nationwide lockdown was lifted. The survey also explored
barriers to healthcare provision and demand and identified innovative ways to regain losses in
vaccination coverage.
METHODS
The surveys were jointly developed by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
(JHSPH) and the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP). The first survey (survey 1) was launched
virtually in April-June 2020 using the software platform Qualtrics, and was distributed to a
network of pediatricians, primary care clinicians, and other care providers. The second survey
(survey 2) was distributed in September 2020, after the nationwide lockdown had been lifted
for three months. Distribution of both surveys and requests to complete them took place via
email, text messages, telephone, in-person, and social media platforms such as WhatsApp.
Survey topics included: perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on caregiver vaccine-seeking
behavior; assessment of routine vaccination services and vaccine campaigns; plans for resuming
vaccination services; strategies employed to motivate vaccine uptake; and, perceived barriers
caregivers and providers face in accessing and providing vaccinations. Surveys were anonymous
and no personal identifiers were collected. This study was reviewed by the JHSPH Institutional
Review Board (IRB) and approved as a non-human subjects research. Responses were collated
in Qualtrics and analysed using Stata version 15.1.

RESULTS
Survey 1 was circulated between 21 April and 11 June 2020, recording 424 responses
representing 21 Indian states and two union territories. Majority of the respondents (96.0%,
407/424) were pediatricians who worked in predominantly urban and private primary,
secondary or tertiary healthcare centers. Among these respondents, 86.6% (367/424) reported
they were directly involved in providing vaccination services at their center.
Complete or partial suspension of immunization services at their respective centers was
reported by 33.4% (142/424) of respondents (Table 1). Among vaccinations facilities, 83.1%
(329/396) observed a >50% decrease in the number of children and families seeking
vaccinations. Known interruption of vaccine campaigns and outreach programs for measles,
rubella, and polio vaccinations were reported by 37.7% (160/424) of respondents. Only 38.7%
(164/424) of respondents reported having a plan for catch-up vaccination once these
restrictions were eased.
Survey 2 resulted in 141 responses between 8-25 September 2020. The characteristics of these
respondents were similar to those from the first survey, with 92.9% (131/141) pediatricians,
representing 21 states and one union territory. Respondents who did not participate in Survey
1 constituted 57.4% (81/141). Over half of respondents (51.7%, 73/141) reported that
compared to pre-pandemic days, they were providing vaccinations less frequently. In Survey 2,
only 32.6% (46/141) of respondents shared that they were seeing less than half the typical
patient volume; this was an improvement from the high proportion of respondents who
reported this drop in patient volume in Survey 1.
Pediatricians shared their perceptions of supply-side (healthcare availability) and demand-side
barriers faced by caregivers. From survey 2, notable supply-side barriers were: low availability
of healthcare workers; financial constraints; and, limited supplies, including PPE (Figure 1).
Barriers to caregiver vaccine uptake included: low awareness of the availability of services;
transportation limitations; fear of contracting COVID-19 from a clinical setting; and, financial
contstraints (Table 1).
Among respondents, 61.7% (87/141) reported receiving guidelines on safe provision of
vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic through the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP).
However, 42.5% (60/141) of respondents claimed they were not aware of state or district
activities to prioritize vaccination catch-up visits. Reported suggestions from respondents for
catch-up vaccinations included: setting up localized communication and catch-up campaigns;
door-to-door outreach campaigns; use of text messaging immunization campaigns; and,
implementing appointment-only, affordable immunization visits.
When asked about the long-term impact of these disruptions on child health, 47.9% (203/424)
of respondents from Survey 1 and 76.6% (108/141) in Survey 2 believed that the lockdown and
its after-effects would result in a vaccine coverage gap (Table 1). Over a quarter of respondents

to both surveys reported that reduced health services may lead to non-COVID-19 illnesses and
deaths; and a similar proportion believed that lockdown related restrictions would result in
imminent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
DISCUSSION
Immunization and child health monitoring are essential services that should be prioritized to
ensure sustainable benefits to society. Our survey findings from primary care providers and
pediatricians in India indicate substantial vaccine service interruptions and concerns about the
long-term impact of lockdowns. With approximately one-quarter of our respondents predicting
increased morbidity and death as well as an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases, frontline
clinicians are anticipating long-lasting effects of pandemic-related disruptions on their patient
populations. The WHO reported major disruptions to vaccination services in countries around
the world, and estimated that approximately 80 million children under the age of one were
living in countries where routine immunization services was disrupted, and could potentially be
at risk for developing a vaccine-preventable illness[2]. Responses from our survey respondents
amplify a growing chorus around the globe calling for a focus on vaccine-preventable illnesses,
even as COVID-19 cases grow worldwide. This comes at a pivotal time in India’s ongoing pursuit
to improve immunization coverage. The national immunization program run by the government
of India is one of the largest in the world, with an annual reach of over 26 million children and
29 million pregnant women[7]. Mission Indradhanush was launched in 2014 to further extend
this reach and achieve full immunization for 90% of children. While remarkable progress has
been made, there is also evidence of existing inequalities in coverage[8].
Early in the pandemic, soon after the lockdown was announced, there were major disruptions
in health services, especially in women and children’s services. Movement restrictions were
likely to have disrupted strategies utilized by Mission Indradhanush, including community
mobilization, door-to-door campaigns, and monitoring events. The National Health Mission’s
health management and information system reported a substantial decrease in routine
immunization services relative to the previous year, indicating that in March 2020, at least
100,000 and 200,000 children missed their BCG and pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,
hepatitis B and Hemophilus influenzae type b) vaccines respectively[9, 10]. Researchers
modelled different scenarios and used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to demonstrate that
widespread disruption to health systems could lead to substantial increases in maternal and
child deaths [11]. In India they estimated an additional 49,000 child deaths and 2,300 maternal
deaths in a month attributable to severely disrupted services[11]. Applying the current
population demographic data in India, estimates suggested that eventually over 27 million
children will miss out on DTP vaccines and other health services, resulting in a 40% increase in
child mortality over the next year[12]. Without targeted campaigns and effort, there is a
legitimate risk for a reversal of gains made through national programs. If vaccination services
are not restored and barriers to access are not addressed, disparities will become more

pronounced and the number of zero-dose children will likely increase. India currently accounts
for 2.1 million of the 20 million unvaccinated and under-vaccinated children globally (11%)[13],
and the national lockdown has shown its potential to further exacerbate this problem.
Experiences from past outbreaks provide lessons on the indirect impacts which can be even
more harmful to health. Analyses from the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015 suggest
that the increased number of deaths caused by other infections such as measles, HIV and
tuberculosis attributable to health system failures exceeded deaths from Ebola[3, 14]. A
sustained period of disrupted immunization can result in the accumulation of susceptible
individuals which in turn can lead to disease outbreaks[15]. Given the disruptions and the
realization of the dire consequences, the Government of India declared immunization an
essential health service in April 2020, and issued guidelines for states to resume routine
immunization services[16]. In June 2020 India began a phased reopening of the economy, and
the resumption of immunization activities were appropriately structured based on local COVID19 infection rates and restrictions. These activities were based on the WHO guidance urging
nations to continue providing essential services along with COVID-19 mitigation and treatment
measures in order to maintain public trust and minimize morbidity and mortality[17].
Coordinated campaigns across India targeting children who missed critical routine vaccinations
during the national lockdown, as well as targeting low-coverage areas, could prevent additional
public health disasters. Prioriting measles vaccine catch up would be most prudent given the
outbreak potential with even marginal reduction in heard immunity[18]. Planning catch-up
campaigns now is essential, so providers can minimize the time children are at risk for vaccinepreventable diseases. Vaccination catch-up sessions could institute innovative strategies such
as implementing appointment-only visits, minimizing overcrowding, separating immunization
visits from sick children visits, prioritizing robust communication efforts which address
caregivers’ fears of contracting COVID-19, and reminders to caregivers of the importance of
routine vaccinations[19].
The Government of India has recently approved COVID-19 vaccines, and the nation has
embarked on one of the largest and most ambitious immunization campaigns in the world.
Although children will not receive the COVID-19 vaccine at this time, their caregivers and
healthcare providers who will receive the vaccine, should be provided with targeted messages
and reminders for childhood routine immunizations. In addition, liaising routine immunization
campaigns with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, particularly in hard-to-reach areas would be
beneficial, given India’s vast human resources and immunization experience.
There are several limitations in this study. Immunization is predominantly offered by the public
health sector in India, while the private health sector typically covers <10% of the
population[20, 21]. Our results reflect a small proportion of the health care system in India, and
may not represent effects in government and rural areas. Nonetheless, the private sector
represents a substantial number of children in India, and can play an important role in
supporting immunization activities undertaken by the government as seen in studies around

the world[22]. The sample size was relatively small, and there may be selection bias as only
those pediatricians interested in immunization may have responded. There were slight
differences in the two rounds of the survey, as questions were modified for the second round
based on new learnings, and the number of responses were lower in the second round.
There is growing evidence that the risk-benefit ratio is decidedly in favor of continuing
vaccination services even when considering consequences of doing so during the pandemic[23].
Gaining provider insights on effective strategies is essential to establishing context-specific
mechanisms to prioritize catch-up for missed vaccines, as well as ensure there is infrastructure
in place for roll-out of the recently approved COVID-19 vaccine. The way forward should include
an increased focus on catch-up campaigns, strong government engagement, effective
surveillance, modelling analyses based on varying scenarios, and clear public health messaging,
as these are critical next steps to ensure restoration of immunization and essential services for
women and children.
