Summary

32

Background

33

With confirmed cases of COVID-19 declining in many countries, lockdown measures are

34

gradually being lifted. However, even if most social distancing measures are continued,

35

other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via

36

conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-

37

escalation of social distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing

38

strategy (CTS) to be successful.

39
40

Methods

41

We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a

42

stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and

43

symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing

44

delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and

45

casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if positive, with

46

different delays (tracing delay) and coverages (tracing coverage). We computed effective

47

reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and

48

various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts.

49
50

Findings

51

For the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of

52

80%), and assuming that around 40% of transmission occur before symptom onset, the

53

model predicts that the effective reproduction number of 1.2 (with social distancing only)

54

will be reduced to 0.8 by adding contact tracing. A testing delay of 2 days requires tracing

55

delay to be at most 1 day, or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1. With a

56

testing/isolation delay of 3 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below

57

1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with

58

decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than

59

conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per

60

index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and ranges from up

61

to 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 42% with a 3-day

62

testing delay and 18% with a 5-day testing delay.

63
64

Interpretation

65

In our model, minimizing testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward

66

transmissions. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for

67

instance with app-based technology, further enhanced CTS effectiveness, with a potential to

68

prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimized, and

69

mobile app technology may reduce delays in the CTS process and optimize contact tracing

70

coverage.

Research in context

76

Evidence before this study

77

We searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for articles published in English from January 1,

78

2020, to June 20, 2020, with the following keywords: (“2019-nCoV” OR “novel coronavirus”

79

OR “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND “contact tracing” AND “model*”. Population-level

80

modelling studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have

81

suggested that isolation and tracing alone might not be sufficient to control outbreaks and

82

additional measures might be required. However, few studies have focused on the effects of

83

lifting individual measures once the first wave of the epidemic has been controlled. Lifting

84

measures must be accompanied by effective contact tracing strategies (CTS) in order to

85

keep the effective reproduction number below 1. A detailed analysis, with special emphasis

86

on the effects of time delays in testing of index patients and tracing of contacts, has not

87

been done.

88
89

Added value of this study

90

We performed a systematic analysis of the various steps required in the process of testing

91

and diagnosing an index case as well as tracing and isolating possible secondary cases of the

92

index case. We then used a stochastic transmission model which makes a distinction

93

between close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts to assess which steps

94

and (possible) delays are crucial in determining the effectiveness of CTS. We

95

evaluated how delays and the level of contact tracing coverage influence the effective

96

reproduction number, and how fast CTS needs to be to keep the reproduction number

97

below 1. We also analyzed what proportion of onward transmission can be prevented for

98

short delays and high contact tracing coverage. Assuming that around 40% of transmission

99

occurs before symptom onset, we found that keeping the time between symptom onset and

100

testing and isolation of an index case short (<3 days) is imperative for a successful CTS. This

101

implies that the process leading from symptom onset to receiving a positive test should be

102

minimized by providing sufficient and easily accessible testing facilities. In addition, reducing

103

contact-tracing delays also helps to keep the reproduction number below 1.

104
105

Implications of all the available evidence

106

Our analyses highlight that CTS will only contribute to containment of COVID-19 if it can be

107

organised in a way that time delays in the process from symptom onset to isolation of the

108

index case and his/her contacts are very short. The process of conventional contact tracing

109

should be reviewed and streamlined, while mobile app technology may offer a tool for

110

gaining speed in the process. Reducing delay in testing subjects for SARS-CoV-2 should be a

111

key objective of CTS.

Introduction

115

As the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 has reached its peak of cases in many countries,

116

societies are preparing so-called exit-strategies from the COVID-19 lockdown, while still

117

successfully controlling transmission. Contact tracing, in combination with quarantine and

118

potentially testing of the contacts, is considered a key component in a phase when lockdown

119

measures are gradually lifted1-8. Contact tracing is an intervention, where an index case with

120

confirmed infection is asked to provide information about contact persons, who were at risk

121

of acquiring infection from the index case within a given time period before the positive test

122

result. These contact persons are then traced and informed about their risk, quarantined, and

123

tested if eligible for testing according to national testing guidelines. This requires upscaling

124

of conventional contact tracing capacity. The potential of mobile apps to support contact

125

tracing is widely discussed and such technology has been used in several Asian countries.

126

Although these countries have successfully reduced case numbers, no causal relationship

127

between use of app technology and epidemic control has yet been shown9-14. Many

128

uncertainties remain on the optimal process of contact tracing with conventional methods

129

and/or mobile applications, on the timing of testing for current or past infection, and on the

130

required coverage of contact tracing needed.

131
132

Modelling studies have demonstrated how mobile applications can increase effectiveness of

133

contact tracing, compared to conventional approaches for contact tracing, but effectiveness

134

depends on what proportion of the population will use the app consistently for a sufficiently

135

long period of time9. Modelling studies have predicted that contact tracing alone cannot

136

control an outbreak if tracing coverage is too low2,15. What tracing coverage is needed

137

depends on how much transmission occurs before symptom onset, and on the details of the

138

tracing process.

140

In previous work, we have investigated the impact of timeliness and completeness of case

141

reporting for the effectiveness of surveillance and interventions16,17, and we quantified the

142

timeliness of contact tracing of infected passengers during an airline flight for the 2009

143

pandemic influenza18. In all of these studies, the timing of various steps in the monitoring and

144

intervention chain emerged as one of the key factors for effectiveness of a public health

145

response. Usually, there are identifiable delays in the response chain that may be critical to

146

the overall effectiveness of a strategy.

147
148

Here we analyze in detail the process chain of identifying index cases by symptom-reporting

149

followed by testing, and subsequent contact tracing, with the aim to inform policy makers on

150

the relative importance of key steps in the process. We use a mathematical model that reflects

151

the various steps and delays in the contact tracing process to quantify the impact of delays on

152

the effective reproduction number and the fraction of onward transmission prevented per

153

diagnosed index case5,19.

Methods

156

Time delays in contact tracing

157

Our starting point is an assumed effective reproduction number (Re) for COVID-19 of around

158

1, describing a situation with “social distancing but measures lifted to some extent”. We then

159

quantify the relative contribution of the individual components of a contact tracing strategy

160

(CTS) required to bring and maintain the effective reproduction number with CTS (RCTS) to a

161

value below 1. For simplicity we do not include transmission in healthcare settings, as in

162

healthcare settings like nursing homes, which can be viewed as closed populations, other

163

interventions are more appropriate.

164

We break down the process of contact tracing in two steps (Figure 1; Supplementary

165

Information Table S1).

166

•

An index case acquires infection (at time T0), then after a short latent period becomes

167

infectious (at time T1), and finally symptomatic (at time T2), which is here defined as

168

“being eligible for testing”. Subsequently a proportion of all symptomatic subjects gets

169

tested and diagnosed (at time T3). The time between T2 and T3 is called the “testing

170

delay” (D1 = T3 - T2), and may vary between 0 and 7 days, and in this period individuals

171

might self-quarantine. We refer to the proportion of all symptomatically infected cases

172

that are tested as testing coverage and vary it from 20% to 80% in increments of 20%.

173

After being diagnosed, we assume index cases are isolated with no further transmission.

174

•

The second step is tracing contacts of the index case, which occurs at time T4. A fraction

175

of those contacts will be found and tested. We assumed that all contacts, regardless of

176

symptoms, are offered testing, and that those testing negative do not spread. Those who

177

are found infected will be isolated, with effectiveness ranging from 0% to 100%. We

178

assume that contacts in isolation do not spread. The time between T3 and T4 is the

179

“tracing delay” (D2 = T4 – T3), which may range from 0 (for instance with app

180

technology) to 3 days (with conventional approaches). In this step, tracing coverage is

181

defined as the proportion of contacts detected, which either depends on the capacity of

182

conventional approaches (ranging from 20% to 80% in increments of 20%) or on the

183

fraction of the population using suitable app technology for screening (ranging from 20%

184

to 100% in increments of 20%). We did not consider hybrid approaches of combined

185

conventional and app-based CTS.

186

The best-case scenario we consider is that persons eligible for testing are immediately tested

187

(coverage 80%) with a very fast test result (test-delay 0 days) and immediate isolation when

188

testing positive, followed by immediate tracing (trace delay 0 days) of all contacts, that

189

immediately adhere to isolation measures (coverage 80%). We consider more realistic

190

scenarios where testing and tracing are suboptimal, e.g. a conventional CTS, and we vary

191

these parameters separately in a sensitivity analysis (see Supplementary Information).

192
193

Impact on effectiveness on population level

194

To analyse the impact of these time delays on the effectiveness of contact tracing we use a

195

model introduced by Kretzschmar et al19, which was adapted for SARS-CoV-25. The

196

stochastic model describes an epidemic as a branching process with progression through

197

latent infection and infectious period in time steps of 1 day. Infectivity and probability of

198

symptom onset per day of the infectious period, and numbers of contacts per day were fitted

199

to distributions taken from published data. 20-24 We distinguish between close contacts (e.g.

200

household contacts, but also other high-risk contacts) and casual contacts, which differ in the

201

risk of acquiring infection from the index case. Also, the time required for tracing and

202

isolating infected contacts and the coverage of tracing may differ between these types of

203

contacts and between different CTS (i.e., conventional contact tracing versus mobile app

204

supported contact tracing). We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that isolated persons do

205

not transmit any longer, and that all traced infected contacts are isolated, regardless of

206

whether they develop symptoms or not. The model allows for explicit computation of the

207

basic reproduction number R0, the effective reproduction number under social-distancing

208

interventions Re, and the effective reproduction number with CTS (Rcts). Reproduction

209

numbers were calculated as expectations, and distributions of individual reproduction

210

numbers were simulated. The model was coded in Mathematica 12.1. For details, see the

211

Supplementary Information.

212
213

Parameter settings

214

We assumed that without social distancing individuals have on average 4 close contacts per

215

day and around 9 casual contacts per day, with stochastic variability. The distributions were

216

fitted to data from the Polymod study for the Netherlands23. Transmission probability per

217

contact for close contacts was taken to be 4 times higher than for casual contacts.

218

Symptomatic and asymptomatic cases were assumed to be equally infectious. Overall, the

219

transmission probability was calibrated to a basic reproduction number of R0 = 2.5. For

220

social distancing, we assumed that close contacts were reduced by 40% and casual contacts

221

by 70%. The resulting effective reproduction number was Re = 1.2.

222
223

Uncertainty of model outcomes

224

We considered uncertainty due to stochastic variability, and uncertainty due to possible

225

variation in parameter estimates. We dealt with stochastic variability by computing

226

individual reproduction numbers for 1000 individuals for all scenarios, and plotted their

227

distributions as boxplots. Parameter uncertainty was explored by performing simulations

228

using hypercube sampling for transmission probabilities and probabilities of symptom onset

229

per day of the infectious period (Supplementary Information).

230
231

Scenarios modelled

232

We analyzed the impact of various testing and tracing delays and tracing coverage on the

233

effective reproduction number Rcts while keeping the testing coverage at 80%. For

234

comparison, we also considered the strategy where symptomatic individuals get tested and

10

235

isolated, without subsequent tracing (Riso). We varied the testing delay D1 between 0 and 7

236

days, the tracing delay D2 between 0 and 3 days, and tracing coverages between 0% and

237

100% in increments of 20%. For conventional contact tracing, we assumed that coverage is

238

higher for close contacts than for casual contacts.

239
240

We then compared the effectiveness of conventional CTS alone with a scenario in which

241

mobile app technology is used for alerting subjects to be tested and for tracing contacts.

242

Differences between these strategies were taken as follows. The testing delay (D1) is reduced

243

with app technology. We assumed a conventional CTS setting in which symptomatic

244

individuals need to decide to seek health care to get tested, and we assumed that with app

245

technology symptomatic persons get alerted and can be tested without health care

246

interference. For conventional CTS we assumed suboptimal coverage in identifying contacts

247

from the week before diagnosis due to recall bias, especially for casual contacts. For CTS

248

with mobile app technology we assume 60% and 80% tracing coverage of the contacts of

249

subjects using app technology. We show also results for 100% coverage, although

250

realistically more than 80% is not feasible, because not all contacts may be correctly

251

identified and compliance with isolation of those tested positive may not be perfect. We

252

assume that tracing goes back for 7 days before the positive test result. The exact parameter

253

values for this comparison are shown in Table 1.

254
255

Next, we quantified the impact of coverage of testing and app use on the effectiveness of

256

CTS. We varied the percentage of app users in the population between 20% and 100% in

257

increments of 20%. We first considered the situation that testing is provided for 80% of

258

persons with symptoms independent of app use, and app use only influences the fraction of

259

contacts that are traced. Alternatively, assumed that only app users are tested (i.e. testing

11

260

coverage varies between 20% and 100% in increments of 20%), and coverage of tracing also

261

depends on fraction of app use. In all cases, a contact person could only be traced if both the

262

index case and the contact person were app users, i.e. the probability of a contact being traced

263

is given by the square of the proportion of app users.

264
265

Finally, we quantified the fraction of transmissions of an index person that can be prevented,

266

and the contribution to the fraction prevented from isolation and from tracing contacts with

267

decreasing delays. The number of onward transmissions of an index case is by definition

268

described by the effective reproduction number of the realized scenario. Therefore, the

269

difference of reproduction numbers between two intervention scenarios under the condition

270

that an index case is diagnosed, describes the fraction of onward transmissions prevented. For

271

contact persons, this is the fraction of the total infectivity that lies after the time of isolation,

272

i.e. the part of infectiousness that is prevented by contact tracing. In other words, a contact

273

person who is detected and isolated before the start of their infectious period is a fully

274

prevented transmission, while a contact person who is only traced and identified after 70% of

275

their infectivity has passed, is counted as 0.3 of a prevented onward transmission.

284

In the best-case scenario, if 80% of infectious persons that develop symptoms are tested and

285

isolated within 1 day after symptom onset the effective reproduction number Re is expected

286

to decline from 1.2 to Riso = 1.0, without contact tracing (Figure 2). Contact tracing may

287

further decrease the reproduction number to Rcts=0.8 in the best case scenario. In the best

288

case scenario – a testing delay of 0 days, a tracing delay of 0 days, and a tracing coverage of

289

80%, the additional reduction of Rcts predicted by the model is 33%. Yet, with a testing delay

290

of 2 days, tracing delay should be at most 1 day, or tracing coverage should be at least 80% to

291

keep Rcts below 1. In these scenarios, the reduction of Rcts compared to the best-case scenario

292

is estimated at 17% (Supplementary Information Figure S4). With a testing delay of more

293

than 3 days, even perfect contact tracing cannot bring Rcts values below 1.

294
295

We assumed that conventional CTS has longer tracing delay and lower tracing coverage than

296

CTS based on app technology which results in marked differences in Rcts for the whole range

297

of testing delay (Figure 2A). With conventional CTS, Rcts would remain above 1, if the

298

testing delay exceeds 0 days, whereas contact tracing based on app technology could still

299

keep Rcts below 1, as long as testing and tracing coverage would be at least 80%, or if testing

300

delay is 1 day and tracing coverage 60%. If the testing delay reaches 5 days or more, app

301

technology adds little effectiveness to conventional CTS or just isolating symptomatic cases.

302
303

The reductions of Re (based on social distancing) achieved by isolation of symptomatic cases

304

only, conventional CTS, and mobile app-based CTS are shown in figure 3A. For isolation

305

only and for conventional CTS we assumed a delay of 4 days between symptom onset and

isolation of the index case. The relative reductions are independent of the level of Re, similar

307

reductions are seen for R0, i.e. in a situation without social distancing (Supplementary

309

27% less effective than mobile app-based CTS alone, due to longer tracing delays and lower

310

tracing coverage. Figure 3B shows the distributions of individual reproduction numbers for

311

the testing delays assumed in Table 1, i.e. 4 days for isolation and conventional CT, and 0

312

days for app-based CTS. Only for app-based CTS the means of the individual reproduction

313

numbers are below 1.

314
315

The effectiveness of app-based technology declines with lower fractions of persons using it

316

(Figure 4). Yet, app-based tracing on its own remains more effective than conventional

317

tracing alone, even with 20% coverage, due to its inherent speed. Even with low coverage

318

there is a reduction of Re, due to fast tracing of a small part of the population. Depending on

319

Re, such an approach might be sufficient to reduce Rcts to levels below 1. This can be seen in

320

the distributions of the individual reproduction numbers (Figure 4B and 4D), where in 4B the

321

means of the distributions are below 1 for 40% and more app use, while in 4D this is the case

322

for 60% and above.

323
324
325

In Table 2, we quantified proportions of transmissions per index case that can be prevented

326

depending on testing delay, stratified by of isolation of index cases and tracing delays. In the

327

best-case scenario (testing and tracing delay being 0 days) around 80% of transmissions can

328

be prevented if tracing coverage is 80%.

Discussion

333

Using a mathematical model that describes the different steps of CTS for COVID-19 we have

334

quantified the relevance of delays and coverage proportions for controlling SARS-CoV-2

335

transmission. We conclude that reducing the testing delay, i.e. shortening the time between

336

symptom onset and positive test result (assuming immediate isolation), is the most important

337

factor for improving CTS effectiveness. Reducing the tracing delay, i.e. shortening the time

338

of contact tracing (assuming immediate testing and isolation if positive), may further enhance

339

CTS effectiveness. Yet this additional effect rapidly declines with increasing testing delay.

340

The effectiveness of app-based CTS declines with lower app use coverage, but it remains

341

more effective than conventional contact tracing even with lower coverage, due to its

342

inherent speed. CTS therefore has the potential to control virus transmission, and to enable

343

alleviation of other control measures, but only if all delays are maximally reduced. It should

344

be noted that we simulated two CTS systems (conventional CTS with testing and tracing

345

delays and app-based CTS without delays) and ignored hybrid approaches. At present, most

346

European countries are using conventional CTS, but are attempting to reduce delays (for

347

example, by improving testing and tracing capacity and by removing testing barriers), and are

348

piloting or planning the addition of app-based contact-tracing. Such hybrid CTS systems

349

would fall somewhere between the fully conventional and app-based scenarios described in

350

this paper.

351
352

Several factors can reduce CTS effectiveness, such as large proportions of cases who remain

353

asymptomatic or are otherwise not diagnosed, and large proportions of contacts who cannot

354

be traced. App-based technology could increase the proportion of tracable contacts, because

355

it does not rely on recall of names and contact details, but this would require the participation

356

of a substantial proportion of the population. App use acceptance may be hampered by

357

privacy concerns and other ethical considerations, which limit its acceptance. Also, app use

358

needs to continue over a long time period, requiring sustained adherence by app users. Low

359

participation does not render CTS useless, however, because it could help to locally

360

extinguish clusters before they grow larger. In addition, every measure that lowers the

361

effective reproduction number, even if it is already below 1, will lower the cumulative case

362

number and speed up the time until elimination of the virus from the population.

363
364

The strength of our approach is that it explicitly takes many details of the contact tracing

365

process into account, such that the key factors can be identified. A limitation of our approach

366

is that it does not take population age-structure into account, which may influence the

367

proportion of asymptomatic cases and mobile app use coverage. Also, the willingness of a

368

case to self-isolate depends on age and social norms, may depend on socio-economic status,

369

and is affected by perceived benefit of isolation in relation to perceived risk of the infection

370

to others25. We also excluded other heterogeneities while assuming homogeneous mixing26,27,

371

and assumed homogeneously distributed use of app technology for different coverage levels.

372

Clustering of non-users may have consequences for overall effectiveness of CTS, similar to

373

clustering of non-vaccinated persons. Furthermore, we ignored that a sizeable portion of

374

transmissions may be acquired nosocomially when population prevalence is still low. 28 The

375

model also ignores that some contacts of the index case may have self-quarantined with

376

symptoms before they are traced by CTS, which lowers the benefits of CTS.

377
378

Our results add to results from other modelling studies, which showed that CTS can be an

379

effective intervention if tracing coverage is high and if the process is fast2,15. A determining

380

factor is the proportion of transmissions occurring before symptom onset, which determines

381

the urgency of tracing and isolating contacts as fast as possible. Our study showed in detail

382

what the role is of each step in the CTS process in making it successful. Our model differs in

383

that it makes a distinction between close and casual contacts, and that we consider scenarios

384

for conventional CTS and mobile app-based CTS characterized by specific delays and

385

coverages.

386
387

Our finding of the crucial importance of the first step of CTS, establishing a diagnosis in

388

cases with symptoms, has important consequences. It requires an infrastructure for testing,

389

that allows persons with symptoms to be tested, preferably, within one day of symptom onset.

390

Studies have demonstrated that viral shedding in the respiratory tract is highest at the start of

391

symptoms29,30, so early testing will also increase the sensitivity of this approach. To further

392

enhance effectiveness, as many infectious persons as possible need to be tested regardless of

393

symptoms, which requires a low threshold for testing. As the clinical symptoms of COVID-

394

19 are mostly mild and heterogeneous, many persons should be eligible for testing, resulting

395

in a large proportion of negative test results. Future work should determine the optimal

396

balance between the proportion of test-negatives and the effectiveness of CTS.

397
398

Our findings also provide strong support to optimize contact tracing. In the Netherlands, CTS

399

was based on establishing contact between an index case and a public health officer, followed

400

by an interview after which contacts are traced. This procedure is labor intensive, time

401

consuming, prone to recall bias, incomplete (anonymous contacts cannot be traced), and

402

usually takes several days. Optimizing this process by improving testing and tracing capacity,

403

removing testing barriers, and by adding app-based and/or other digital technologies to

404

minimize tracing delay are needed to establish optimal control of transmission. These

405

improvements are currently being implemented or considered. Overall, our findings suggest

406

that optimized CTS, with short delays and high coverage for testing and tracing could

407

substantially reduce the reproduction number, which would allow alleviation of more

408

stringent control measures.

social distancing is implemented (Re). For the isolation scenario and conventional tracing scenario we
assumed that there is a delay of 4 days between symptom onset and isolation of the index case. For
