Abstract
Currently, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a big threat to global health. The rapid
spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with
a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is
very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining
data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this
paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction
of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of
borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual countrybased model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive
tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, the proposed model uses countrywide
covariates to adjust infection trajectories in curve fitting. A joint variable selection technique has
been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level
risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.

Introduction

Since Thursday, March 26, 2020, the US leads the world in terms of the cumulative number of infected cases for a novel coronavirus, COVID-19. On this day, a dashboard provided
by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at the Johns Hopkins University
(https://systems.jhu.edu/-) (Dong et al., 2020) reported that the numbers of the confirmed, death,
and recovered from the virus in the US are 83,836, 1,209, and 681, respectively. Figure 1 displays
daily infection trajectories describing the cumulative numbers of infected cases for eight countries
(US, Russia, UK, Brazil, Germany, China, India, and South Korea), spanning from January 22nd
to May 14th, which accounts for 114 days. The dotted vertical lines on the panel mark certain
historical dates that will be explained. As seen from the panel, the US has been a late-runner
until March 11th in terms of the infected cases, but the growth rate of the cases had suddenly
skyrocketed since the day, and eventually excelled the forerunner, China, just in two weeks, on
March 26th. Figure 2 shows the cumulative infected cases for 40 countries on May 14th: on the
day, the number of cumulative infected cases for the US was 1,417,774 which is more than five
times of that of Russia, 252,245.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been numerous research works to better understand
the pandemic in different aspects (Gao et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Peng et al.,
2020; Qiang Li, 2020; Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020; Sheng Zhang, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Some
of the recent works from statistics community are as follows. Sheng Zhang (2020) focused on a
serial interval (the time between successive cases in a chain of transmissions) and used the gamma
distribution to study the transmission on Diamond Princess cruise ship. Peng et al. (2020) proposed
the generalized susceptible exposed infectious removed model to predict the inflection point for the
growth curve, while Yang et al. (2020) modified the proposed model and considered the public
health interventions in predicting the trend of COVID-19 in China. Liu et al. (2020) proposed
a differential equation prediction model to identify the influence of public policies on the number
of patients. Qiang Li (2020) used a symmetrical function and a long tail asymmetric function to
analyze the daily infections and deaths in Hubei and other places in China. Remuzzi and Remuzzi
(2020) used an exponential model to study the number of infected patients and patients who need
intensive care in Italy. One of the major limitations of these works is that the researches are confined

by analyzing data from a single country, thereby neglecting the global nature of the pandemic.
One of the major challenges in estimating or predicting an infection trajectory is the heterogeneity of the country populations. It is known that there are four stages of a pandemic: visit
economictimes.indiatimes.com/-. The first stage of the pandemic contains data from people with
travel history to an already affected country. In stage two, we start to see data from local transmission, people who have brought the virus into the country transmit it to other people. In the
third stage, the source of the infection is untraceable. In stage four the spread is practically uncontrollable. In most of the current literature, estimation or prediction of the infection trajectory
is based on a single country data where the status of the country falls into one of these four stages.
Hence, such estimation or prediction may fail to capture some crucial changes in the shape of the
infection trajectory due to a lack of knowledge about the other stages. This motivates the use of
data integration (Huttenhower and Troyanskaya, 2006; Lenzerini, 2002) which combines data from
different countries and elicits a solution with a unified view of them. This will be particularly useful
in the current context of the COVID-19 outbreak.

with squared root for visualization purpose.) The red dashed vertical lines represents 1,417,774
cases.
Recently, there are serious discussions all over the world to answer the crucial question: “even
though the current pandemic takes place globally due to the same virus, why infection trajectories of
different countries are so diverse?” For example, as seen from Figure 1, the US, Italy, and Spain have
accumulated infected cases within a short period of time, while China took a much longer time since
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to different shapes of infection trajectories. It will be
interesting to find a common structure in these infection trajectories for multiple countries, and to
see how these trajectories are changing around this common structure. Finally, it is significant to
identify the major countrywide covariates which make infection trajectories of the countries behave
differently in terms of the spread of the disease.

Significance

The rapid spread of coronavirus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. Scientists are working on estimating the infection
trajectory for future prediction of cases, which will be useful for future planning and policymaking.
We propose a hierarchical model that integrates worldwide data to estimate COVID-19 infection

trajectories. Due to information borrowing across multiple countries, the proposed growth curve
model will be a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally,
we use countrywide covariates to adjust curve fitting for the infection trajectory. A joint variable
selection technique has been integrated into the modeling scheme, which will identify the possible
reasons for diversity among the country-specific infection curves.

Our Contribution

There are three major classes of infectious disease prediction models: (i) differential equation
models, (ii) time series models, and (iii) the statistical models. The differential equation models
describe the dynamic behavior of the disease through differential equations allowing the laws of
transmission within the population. The popular models include the SI, SIS, SIR, and SEIR
models (Hethcote, 2000; Korobeinikov, 2004; Tiberiu Harko, 2014). These models are based on
assumptions related to S (susceptible), E (exposed), I (infected), and R (remove) categories of the
population. Time series based prediction models such as ARIMA, Grey Model, Markov Chain
models have been used to describe dependence structure over of the disease spread over time (Hu
et al., 2006; Reza Yaesoubi, 2011; Rushton et al., 2006; Shen X, 2013; Zhirui He, 2018). On
the other hand, statistical models, so-called phenomenological models, which follow certain laws
of epidemiology (Clayton and Hills, 2013; Thompson et al., 2006) are widely used in real-time
forecasting for infection trajectory or size of epidemics in early stages of pandemic (Fineberg and
Wilson, 2009; Hsieh, 2009; Pell et al., 2018). Statistical models can be easily extended to the
framework of hierarchical models (multilevel models) to analyze data within a nested hierarchy,
eventually harnessing the data integration (Browne et al., 2006; Hill, 1965; Stone and Springer,
1965; Tiao and Tan, 1965). In this paper, we use Bayesian hierarchical models so that data
integration and uncertainty analysis (Malinverno and Briggs, 2004) are possible in a unified way.
Specifically, we use the Richards growth curve model (Richards, 1959). The novelties of our
method are as follows: we (i) use a flexible hierarchical growth curve model to global COVID-19
data, (ii) integrate information from multiple countries for estimation and prediction purposes, (iii)
adjust for country-specific covariates, and (iv) perform covariate selection to identify the important
reasons to explain the differences among the country-wise infection trajectories. We demonstrate

that our proposed models perform better than an individual country-based model.

3.1

Richards growth curve models

Richards growth curve model (Richards, 1959), so-called the generalized logistic curve (Nelder,
1962), is a growth curve model for population studies in situations where growth is not symmetrical
about the point of inflection (Anton and Herr, 1988; Seber and Wild, 2003). The curve was widely
used to describe various biological processes (Werker and Jaggard, 1997), but recently adapted in
epidemiology for real-time prediction of outbreak of diseases; examples include SARS (Hsieh, 2009;
Hsieh et al., 2004), dengue fever (Hsieh and Chen, 2009; Hsieh and Ma, 2009), pandemic influenza
H1N1 (Hsieh, 2010), and COVID-19 outbreak (Wu et al., 2020).
There are variant reparamerized forms of the Richards curve in the literature (Birch, 1999; Cao
et al., 2019; Causton, 1969; Kahm et al., 2010), and we shall use the following form in this research
f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) = θ1 · [1 + ξ · exp{−θ2 · (t − θ3 )}]−1/ξ ,

(1)

where θ1 , θ2 , and θ3 are real numbers, and ξ is a positive real number. The utility of the Richards
curve (1) is its ability to describe a variety of growing processes, endowed with strong flexibility due
to the shape parameter ξ (Birch, 1999): analytically, the Richards curve (1) (i) becomes the logistic
growth curve (Tsoularis and Wallace, 2002) when ξ = 1, and (ii) converges to Gompertz growth
curve (Gompertz, 1825) as the ξ converges to zero from positive side of real numbers. (Gompertz
curve is g(t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) = θ1 · exp [− exp {−θ2 · (t − θ3 )}].) But it is also known that estimation of ξ is
a complicated problem (Wang et al., 2016), and we resort to a modern sampling scheme, elliptical
slice sampler (Murray et al., 2010), to estimate the ξ. (See SI Appendix for more detail.)
Figure 3 illustrates roles of the four parameters of the Richards curve (1). The curves on left
panel is obtained when (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) = (10000, 0.2, 40), while varying the ξ to be 1 × 10−13 (≈ 0), 0.5,
and 1, respectively. The right panel pictorially describes the roles of (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ): θ1 represents the
asymptote of the curve; θ2 is related to a growth rate (analytically, the derivative of logarithm of
the curve (1) at t = θ3 is θ2 /2.); and θ3 sets the displacement along the x-axis. (For more technical
detail for the parameters, refer to (Birch, 1999).)
In epidemiological modeling, the Richards curve (1) can be used as a parametric curve describ-

ing infection trajectories shown in the Figure 1. In this context, each of the parameters can be
interpreted as follows: θ1 represents the final epidemic size (that is, the maximum cumulative number of infected cases across the times); θ2 represents infection rate; and θ3 represents a lag phase
of the trajectory. (The shape parameter ξ seems to have no clear epidemiological meaning (Wang
et al., 2012).) We shall revisit more detailed interpretations of the parameter in Subsection 4.5.

Figure 3: Description of the Richards growth curve model. The curve is obtained when (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) =
(10000, 0.2, 40). The left panel is obtained by changing the ξ to be 1×10−13 , 0.5, and 1, respectively.
The right panel describes the roles the three parameters in epidemiological modeling: θ1 represents
final epidemic size; θ2 is an infection rate; and θ3 is a lag phase.

Results
Benefits from the information borrowing

We investigate the predictive performance of three Bayesian models based on the Richards growth
curve. We start with the individual country-based model (here we use only the single country
data) which has been widely used in the literature (M1 ). Next, we extend the previous model
to a hierarchical model by utilizing the infection trajectories of all the 40 countries (M2 ). A
limitation of M2 is that it lacks certain countrywide adjustments in estimating the trajectories
where the borrowing information takes place uniformly across all the countries although those
countries are heterogeneous in terms of aspects like socioeconomic, health environment, etc.. Next,
we further upgrade this model by adding country-specific covariates in a hierarchical fashion (M3 ).

(For technical description for the three models, see the Subsection 6.3.) Eventually, borrowing
information across the 40 countries takes place in these two hierarchical models, M2 and M3 , but
not in the individual country-based model M1 .
For evaluation criteria, we calculate the mean squared error (MSE) (Wasserman, 2013) associated with the extrapolated infection trajectory for each of the 40 countries. Training and test data
are designated as follows: given that yk = (yk,1 , · · · , yk,T )> is an infection trajectory of the k-th
country spanning for T days since January 22nd, and d is the chosen test-day, then (i) the training
data is set by the trajectory spanning for T −d days since January 22nd (that is, (yk,1 , · · · , yk,T −d )),
and (ii) the test data is set by the d recent observations (that is, (yk,T −d+1 , · · · , yk,T )).
For the two hierarchical models M2 and M3 , the MSE is averaged over the 40 countries:

Figure 4. From the panel, we see that (1) the predictive performances of two hierarchical models,
M2 and M3 , are universally better than that of M1 across the number of test-days; and (2) the
performance of M3 is marginally better than M2 . Based on the outcomes, we shall conclude that
information borrowing has improved the predictive accuracy in terms of MSE. We present all the
results in the consequent subsections based on the model M3 . A similar result is found in the
Clemente problem from (Efron, 2010) where the James-Stein estimator (James and Stein, 1992)
better predicts then an individual hitter-based estimator in terms of the total squared prediction
error.

COVID-19 travel recommendations by country

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categorizes countries into three levels by assessing the risk of COVID-19 transmission, used in travel recommendations by country (Visit
www.cdc.gov/-): Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 indicate the Watch Level (Practice Usual Precautions), Alert Level (Practice Enhanced Precautions), and Warning Level (Avoid Nonessential
Travel), respectively.
We categorize the 40 countries into the three levels according to their posterior means for the
final epidemic size (that is, θ1 of the Richards curve (1)). Grouping criteria are as follows: (1) Level
1 (estimated total number is no more than 10,000 cases); (2) Level 2 (estimated total number is
between 10,000 and 100,000 cases); and (3) Level 3 (estimated total number is more than 100,000
cases).
Figure 5 displays results of posterior inference for the θ1 by country, based on the model M3 .
Countries on the y-axis are ordered from the severest country (US) to the least severe country
(Malaysia) in the magnitude of the posterior means. The red horizontal bars on the panel represent
the 95% credible intervals, describing uncertainty for the estimation. Base on the results, there are
14 countries categorized as Level 3 (US, Russia, Brazil, Pakistan, UK, Spain, Italy, India, France,
Germany, Peru, Iran, Chile, and Canada). There are 21 countries categorized as Level 2 (from
Saudi Arabia to South Korea), and 5 countries categorized as Level 1 (from Czechia to Malaysia).

Extrapolated infection trajectories and flat time points

Figure 7 displays the extrapolated infection trajectory (posterior mean for the Richards curve (1))
for the US. The posterior mean of the final epidemic size is 1,760,569 cases. The scenario that
‘millions’ of Americans could be infected was also warned by a leading expert in infectious diseases
(Visit a related news article www.bbc.com/-). It is known that prediction of an epidemic trend
from limited data during early stages of the epidemic is often futile and misleading (Hsieh et al.,
2004). Nevertheless, estimation of a possible severity havocked by the COVID-19 outbreak is an
important task when considering the seriousness of the current pandemic situation.
A crucial question is when this trajectory gets flattened. To that end, we approximate a time
point where an infection trajectory levels off its value, showing a flattening pattern after the time
point. The following is the definition of the flat time point which we use in this paper:
Definition 4.1. Given the Richards curve f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) (1) and some small  > 0, the flat time

Figure 6: Illustration of flat time point. The exemplary infection trajectory is obtained by the
Richards curve when (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) = (10000, 0.2, 40, 0.5). A flat time point tflat, is approximately
63 (vertical red dashed line). The vertical difference between the θ1 and the function value of
Richards curve evaluated at tflat, is  = 100 (cases).
Specifically speaking, the flat time point tflat, is the time point whereat only  number of
infected cases can maximally take place to reach the final epidemic size θ1 , after the time point
tflat, . Figure 6 depicts an exemplary infection trajectory obtained by the Richards curve (1) with
(θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) = (10000, 0.2, 40, 0.5). In this case, a flat time point tflat, is approximately 63 when
 = 100. The choice of  > 0 depends on the situation of a country considered: for China which
already shows flattening phase (refer to Figure 1) in the infection trajectory,  = 1 (case) can be
safely used, but for US one may use  = 1, 000 (cases) or larger numbers.
For the US, the posterior means of the flat time points tflat, are June 11th, July 27th, September 10th, and October 26th when corresponding ’s are chosen by 100,000, 10,000, 1,000, and 100,
respectively. It is important to emphasize that the extrapolated infection trajectory is real-time
prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks (Fineberg and Wilson, 2009; Wang et al., 2012) based on observations tracked until May 14th. Certainly, incorporation of new information such as compliance
with social distancing or advances in medical and biological sciences for this disease will change the
inference outcomes.

Global trend for the COVID-19 outbreak

Figure 9 displays the extrapolated infection trajectory for grand average over 40 countries obtained
from the model M3 . Technically, this curve is acquired by extrapolating the Richards curve by
using the intercept terms in linear regressions (3). The grey dots on the panel are historical infection
trajectories for 40 countries. Posterior means for the final epidemic size is 145,497 cases. Posterior
means for the flat time points are tflat,=1,000 =June 12th and tflat,=100 =July 9th.

Identifying risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19

COVID-19 is a new disease and there is very limited information regarding risk factors for this
severe disease. There is no vaccine aimed to prevent the transmission of the disease because there
is no specific antiviral agent is available. It is very important to find risk factors relevant to the
disease. Reliable and early risk assessment of a developing infectious disease outbreak allow for
policymakers to make swift and well-informed decisions that would be needed to ensure epidemic
control.

CDC described High-Risk Conditions based on currently available information and clinical
expertise (For more detail, visit www.cdc.gov/-): those at higher risk for infection, severe illness,
and poorer outcomes from COVID-19 include
• People 65 years and older;
• People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility;
• People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma;
• People who are immunocompromised, possibly caused by cancer treatment, smoking, bone
marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and
prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications;
• People with severe obesity (body mass index of 40 or higher);
• People with diabetes;
• People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis;
• People with liver disease.
The model M3 involves three separated linear regressions whose response and coefficient vector
are given by θl and βl , respectively (l = 1, 2, 3). (See the equation (3)) The sparse horseshoe
prior (Carvalho et al., 2009, 2010) is imposed for each of the coefficient vectors which makes the
model equipped with covariates analysis. That way, we can identify key predictors explaining the
heterogeneity of shapes existing in infection trajectories across 40 countries, and this can be further
used in finding risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19. The results are in table 1 1.

The followings are general guidelines on how covariates on the Table 1 can be interpreted in
the current context of pandemic.
• The parameter θ1 represents final epidemic size. A larger number of θ1 indicates that a
country has (can have) more COVID-19 infected patients in the country. A covariate with
plus sign (+) (or minus sign (−)) is a factor associated with an increase (or decrease) of the
total infected cases.
• The parameter θ2 represents infection rate. A larger number of θ2 implies a faster spread of
the virus around the country. A covariate with plus sign (+) (or minus sign (−)) is a factor
associated with a rapid (or slow) spread of the virus.
• The parameter θ3 represents lag phase of the infection trajectory. The larger the value of θ3
the later the trajectory begins to accumulate infected cases, leading to a later onset of the
accumulation. A covariate with plus sign (+) (or minus sign (−)) is a factor associated with
delaying (or bring forward) the onset of the accumulation.
Now, based on the aforementioned guideline, we shall interpret the Table 1 in detail. (The
reasoning reflects our subjectivity, and disease expert should decipher precisely.)
As for the parameter θ1 , insufficient physical activity has been selected as one of the important
risk factors which may increase the final epidemic size of a country: this implies that certain government policies such as social distancing or remote work system can help decrease the final epidemic
size. Additionally, intense immunization coverage on measles, Polio, and Haemophilus Influenzae
type B can reduce the final epidemic size. Poor general health status of a population (Jennifer
Beam Dowd, 2020) such as overweight and alcohol addiction can increase the epidemic size. (visit
related news article www.cidrap.umn.edu/-.) Certain testing information is also associated with
the epidemic size, which can be further researched in retrospective studies in swift policymaking for
a future pandemic. Finally, the average temperature is negatively related to the epidemic size. (See
a WHO report for the relationship between climate change and infectious diseases www.who.int/-.)
Turning to the parameter θ2 , a rigorous fulfillment of general obligations at point of entry
is chosen as one of the significant predictors in reducing the infection rate. Additionally, poor
smoking and alcoholic behaviors of a country population are risk factors that may increase the
infection rate. Demographically, it has been found that densely populated countries or countries
where life expectancy is relatively high are more venerable to the rapid disease transmission among
people. Among national environmental status, poor air condition which may negatively influence
people’s respiratory system is found to be a risk factor increasing the infection rate.

Finally, moving to the parameter θ3 , geological distance from China is an important covariate
delaying the onset of the infected cases. The lag of onset is also graphically observed from the
Figure 1: time point whereat South Korea begins to accumulate the infected cases is relatively
earlier than those of the US, UK, etc. Similar to θ2 , heavier alcohol drinking and tobacco use may
result in an earlier onset of the accumulation of the infected patients, thereby bringing forward the
infection trajectory. Having larger numbers of median age and elderly people of a population can
shorten the lag phase. Finally, conducting frequent testing for the COVID-19 helps detect infected
patients, followed by the earlier accumulation for the confirmed cases.

Discussions

It is important to emphasize that, while medical and biological sciences are on the front lines of
beating back COVID-19, the true victory relies on advance and coalition of almost every academic
field. However, information about COVID-19 is limited: there are currently no vaccines or other
therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19
(on April 13, 2020). Although numerous research works are progressed by different academic field,
the information about COVID-19 is scattered around different disciplines, which truly requires
interdisciplinary research to hold off the spread of the disease.
The real-time forecast during early stages of the pandemic may results in premature inference
outcomes (Hsieh et al., 2004), but it should not demoralize predictive analysis as the entire human
race is currently threatened by unprecedented crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic. To improve the
predictive accuracy, data integration from multiple countries is a key notion, which is closely related
to borrowing information. The motivation of using the borrowing information is to make use of
indirect evidence (Efron, 2010) to enhance the predictive performance: for example, to extrapolate
the infection trajectory for the US, the information not only from the US (direct evidence) but also
from other countries (indirect evidence) are utilized to better predict the trajectory for the US.
Further, to render the information borrowing endowed with uncertainty quantification, Bayesian
argument is inevitable, inducing sensible inferences and decisions for users (Lindley, 1972).
The results demonstrated the superiority of our approach compared to an existing individual country-based model. Our research outcomes can be thought even more insightful given that

we have not employed information about disease-specific covariates. That being said, using more
detailed information such as social mixing data, precise hospital records, or patient-specific information will further improve the performance of our model. Moreover, integration of epidemiological
models with these statistical models will be our future topic of research.

Research data

In this research, we analyze global COVID-19 data {yi , xi }N
i=1 , obtained from N = 40 countries.
(Meanings for the vector notations, yi and xi , will be explained shortly later.) These countries are
most severely affected by the COVID-19 in terms of the confirmed cases on May 14th, and listed on
Table 2: each country is contained in the table with format “country name (identifier)”, and this
identifier also indicates a severity rank, where a lower value indicates a severer status. The order
of the ranks thus coincides with the order of the countries named on the y-axis of the Figure 2.
Table 2: 40 countries on the research
Country (index i)
US (1), Russia (2), Spain (3), United Kingdom (4), Italy (5),
Brazil (6), France (7), Germany (8), Iran (9), China (10),
India (11), Peru (12), Canada (13), Belgium (14), Saudi Arabia (15),
Netherlands (16), Chile (17), Pakistan (18), Switzerland (19), Portugal (20),
Sweden (21), Qatar (22), Singapore (23), Ireland (24), United Arab Emirates (25),
Poland (26), Japan (27), Israel (28), Romania (29), Austria (30),
Indonesia (31), Philippines (32), South Korea (33), Denmark (34), Egypt (35),
Czechia (36), Norway (37), Australia (38), Malaysia (39), Finland (40)
NOTE: Countries are listed with the form “country name (identifier)”. This identifier also
represents a severity rank. The rank is measured based on the accumulated number of the
confirmed cases on May 14th.

For each country i (i = 1, · · · , N ), let yit denotes the number of accumulated confirmed cases for
COVID-19 at the t-th time point (t = 1, · · · , T ). Here, the time indices t = 1 and t = T correspond
to the initial and end time points, January 22nd and May 14th, respectively, spanning for T = 114
(days). The time series data yi = (yi1 , · · · , yit , · · · , yiT )> is referred to as an infection trajectory for
the country i. Infection trajectories for eight countries (US, Russia, UK, Brazil, Germany, China,
India, and South Korea) indexed by i = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 33, respectively, are displayed in

the Figure 1. We collected the data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at the
Johns Hopkins University.
For each country i, we collected 45 covariates, denoted by xi = (xi1 , · · · , xij , · · · , xip )> (p = 45).
The 45 predictors can be further grouped by 6 categories: the 1st category: general country and
population distribution and statistics; the 2nd category: general health care resources; the 3rd
category: tobacco and alcohol use; the 4th category: disease and unhealthy prevalence; the 5th category: testing and immunization statistics; and the 6th category: international health regulations
monitoring. The data sources are the World Bank Data (https://data.worldbank.org/-), World
Health Organization Data (https://apps.who.int/-), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (https://www.noaa.gov/-). Detailed explanations for the covariates are described in
SI Appendix.

6.2

Bayesian hierarchical Richards model

We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model based on the Richards curve (1), which is referred to as
Bayesian hierarchical Richards model (BHRM), to accommodate the COVID-19 data {yi , xi }N
i=1 .
(Although the model is based on the Richards curve, the idea can be generalized to any choice for
growth curves.) Ultimately, a principal goal of the BHRM is to establish two functionalities:
(a) [Extrapolation] uncover a hidden pattern from the infection trajectory for each country i,
that is, yi = (yi1 , · · · , yiT )> , through the Richards growth curve f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) (1), and
then extrapolate the curve.
(b) [Covariates analysis] identify important predictors among the p predictors x = (x1 , · · · , xp )>
that largely affect on the shape the curve f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) in terms of the three curve parameters.
A hierarchical formulation of the BHRM is given as follows. First, we introduce an additive
independently identical Gaussian error to each observation {yit }N,T
i=1,t=1 , leading to a likelihood
part:

yit = f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) + it ,

it ∼ N (0, σ 2 ),

(i = 1, · · · , N, t = 1, · · · , T ),

(2)

where f (t; θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi ) is the Richards growth curve (1) which describes a growth pattern of
infection trajectory for the i-th country. Because each of the curve parameters (θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) has its

own epidemiological interpretations, we construct three separate linear regressions:
θli = αl + x>
i βl + εli ,

εli ∼ N (0, σl2 ),

(i = 1, · · · , N, l = 1, 2, 3),

(3)

where βl = (βl1 , · · · , βlj , · · · , βlp )> is a p-dimensional coefficient vector corresponding to the l-th
linear regression.
For the shape parameter ξ, we assume the standard log-normal prior:

ξi ∼ log N (0, 1),

(i = 1, · · · , N ).

(4)

The motivation of choosing the log-normal prior (4) for the ξi is that the prior puts effectively
enough mass on the region (0, 3) where most of the estimates for the ξi (i = 1, · · · , N ) concentrated
on. Additionally, Gaussianity prior assumption makes it possible to employ the elliptical slice
sampler (Murray et al., 2010) in sampling from the full conditional posterior distribution of the ξi .
To impose a continuous shrinkage effect (Bhadra et al., 2019) on each of the coefficient vectors,
we adopt to use the horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al., 2009, 2010):
βlj |λlj , τlj , σl2 ∼ N (0, σl2 τl2 λ2lj ),

λlj , τlj ∼ C + (0, 1),

(l = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, · · · , p).

(5)

Finally, improper priors (Gelman et al., 2004) are used for the intercept terms and error variances
terms in the model:

αl ∼ π(α) ∝ 1,

σ 2 , σl2 ∼ π(σ 2 ) ∝ 1/σ 2 ,

(l = 1, 2, 3).

(6)

See SI Appendix for a posterior computation for the BHRM (2) – (6).

yt = f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ) + t , t ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), θl ∼ N (αl , σl2 ), ξ ∼ log N (0, 1), (t = 1, · · · , T, l = 1, 2, 3),
where f (t; θ1 , θ2 , θ3 ) is the Richards growth curve (1), and improper priors (Gelman et al.,
2004) are used for error variances and intercept terms as (6).
M2 is a Bayesian hierarchical model without using covariates, which uses infection trajectories
from N countries, {yi }N
i=1 . This model is equivalent to BHRM (2) – (6) with removed
covariates terms in (3).
M3 is the BHRM (2) – (6).

Appendix B

Posterior computation

We illustrate a full description of a posterior computation for the BHRM (2) – (6) by using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation (Robert and Casella, 2013). To start with, for
illustration purpose, we shall use vectorized notations for the likelihood part (2), regression part
(3), and its coefficients part (5):
yi |θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi , σ 2 ∼ NT (fi (θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi ), σ 2 I),
θl |αl , βl , σl2 ∼ NN (1αl + Xβl , σl2 I),
βl |τl , λl , σl2 ∼ Np (0, σl2 τl2 Λl ),

(i = 1, · · · , N ),
(l = 1, 2, 3),
(l = 1, 2, 3).

The T -dimensional vector yi = (yi1 , · · · , yit , · · · , yiT )> (i = 1, · · · , N ) is the observed infection
trajectory for the country i across the times. The notation f(θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi ) (i = 1, · · · , N ) is
T -dimensional vector that describes the Richard curves across the times:
f(θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi ) = (f (1; θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi ), . . . , f (T ; θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi ))> ,

(i = 1, · · · , N ).

The vectors θl = (θl1 , · · · , θlN )> (l = 1, 2, 3) and ξ = (ξ1 , · · · , ξN )> are N -dimensional vectors for
the four parameters of the Richards curve (1) across the N countries.
The matrix X is N -by-p design matrix whose i-th row vector is given by the p predictors
xi = (xi1 , · · · , xip )> ∈ Rp , (i = 1, · · · , N ). The notation I stands for an identity matrix. Before
implementing, it is recommended that each of column vectors of the design matrix X is standardized
(Armagan et al., 2013; Tibshirani, 1996): that is, each column vector has been centered, and then
columnwisely scaled so that each column vector has mean zero and unit l2 Euclidean norm.
The p-dimensional vector βl = (βl1 , · · · , βlp )> (l = 1, 2, 3) denotes p coefficients from the l-th
regression. The vector λl = (λl1 , · · · , λlp )> (l = 1, 2, 3) is p-dimensional vector for the local-scale
parameters, and the matrix Λl is p-by-p diagonal matrix Λl = diag(λ2l1 , · · · , λ2lp ) (l = 1, 2, 3). The
τl (l = 1, 2, 3) is referred to as the global-scale parameter (Carvalho et al., 2010).
Under the formulation of BHRM (2) – (6), our goal is to sample from the full joint posterior
distribution π(θ1 , θ2 , θ3 , ξ, σ 2 , Ω1 , Ω2 , Ω3 |y1:N ) where Ωl = {αl , βl , λl , τl , σl2 } (l = 1, 2, 3), whose

To sample from the full joint density, we use a Gibbs sampler (Casella and George, 1992) to exploit
conditional independences among the latent variables induced by the hierarchy. The following
algorithm describes a straightforward Gibbs sampler
Step 1. Sample θ1 from its full conditional distribution
π(θ1 |−) ∼ NN (Σθ1 {(1/σ 2 )r + (1/σl2 )(1α1 + Xβ1 )}, Σθ1 ),
where Σθ1 = {(1/σ 2 )H + (1/σl2 )I}−1 ∈ RN ×N . Here, the vector r is a N -dimensional vector
>
>
which is given by r = (y>
1 h(θ21 , θ31 , ξ1 ), . . . , yN h(θ2N , θ3N , ξN )) such that the T -dimensional
vector h(θ2i , θ3i , ξi ) (i = 1, · · · , N ) is obtained by
h(θ2i , θ3i , ξi ) = (h(1; θ2i , θ3i , ξi ), . . . , h(T ; θ2i , θ3i , ξi ))> ,
where h(t; θ2 , θ3 , ξ) = [1 + ξ · exp{−θ2 · (t − θ3 )}]−1/ξ .
Step 2. Sample θ2i and θ3i , i = 1, · · · , N , independently from their full conditional distributions. Proportional parts of the distributions are given by

Here, k · k2 indicates the l2 -norm. Note that the two conditional densities are not known in
closed forms because two parameters, θ2i and θ3i , participate to the function f(θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , ξi )
in a nonlinear way. We use the Metropolis algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2003) with Gaussian
proposal densities within this Gibbs sampler algorithm.
Step 3. Sample ξi , i = 1, · · · , N , independently from its full conditional distribution. Proportional parts of the distributions are given by

exponent, sampling from the density needs a delicate care, where by we employed the elliptical
slice sampler (Murray et al., 2010).

Elliptical slice sampler for Step 3

To start with we shall use the variable change (η = log ξ) to the right hand side of (A.1):
π(ηi |−) ∝ L(ηi ) · N (ηi |0, 1),

(i = 1, · · · , N ),

(A.2)

such that L(ηi ) = exp{−kyi − f(θ1i , θ2i , θ3i , eηi )k22 /(2σ 2 )} corresponds to a likelihood part.
Now, we use the elliptical slice sampler (ESS) (Murray et al., 2010; Nishihara et al., 2014)
(s+1)

to sample from ηi

∼ π(ηi |−) (A.2) (i = 1, · · · , N ) that exploits the Gaussian prior measure.

Conceptually, ESS and the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm (Chib and Greenberg, 1995) are
similar: both methods are comprised of two steps: proposal step and criterion step. A difference

between the two algorithms arises in the criterion step. If the new candidate does not pass the
criterion, then MH takes the current state as the next state: whereas, ESS re-proposes a new candidate until rejection does not take place, rendering the algorithm rejection-free. Further information
for ESS is referred to the original paper (Murray et al., 2010). After ESS has been employed, the
realized ηi needs to be transformed back through ξ = eη . Algorithm 1 illustrates the full description
of algorithms: to avoid notation clutter, the index i is omitted.
