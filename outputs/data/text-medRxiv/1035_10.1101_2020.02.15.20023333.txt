Abstract

2

Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel

3

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of

4

the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global

5

community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted

6

diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and

7

support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak.

8

We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the

9

2019-nCoV outbreak.

10

Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on

11

January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or

12

working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in

13

information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and

14

treatment-seeking behaviors were queried.

15

Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the

16

information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the

17

local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found,

18

particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under

19

quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08)

20

and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both

21

strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority

22

of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital

23

treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of

24

the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under

25

quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment.

26

Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high

27

institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant

28

determinants of hospital treatment-seeking.

29

Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important

30

factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care

31

during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely

32

contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention

33

to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant

34

to seek treatment at formal health services.

Evidence before this study

48

We searched PubMed on January 28, 2020, for articles that describe the trust,

49

preventive practices and health-seeking behaviors related to the 2019 novel coronavirus

50

(2019-nCoV) in China, using the search terms “novel coronavirus,” “institutional trust,”

51

“behavioral change,” “protective behaviors,” and “treatment-seeking” with no

52

language or publication time restrictions. Previously published research discussed the

53

behavioral responses to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and

54

the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Hong Kong. The only report investigating

55

the influence of institutional trust and public responses was published on March 27,

56

2019, on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. No previous

57

studies have investigated how trust in the information provision and prevention

58

instructions from the authorities during a disease outbreak has influenced the public’s

59

prevention practices and treatment-seeking in the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV.

61

Introduction

62

Starting on December 8, 2019, several cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan,

63

Hubei province, China (1,2). Subsequently, on January 7, 2020 the Chinese Center for

64

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified a novel coronavirus linked to the

65

outbreak, which was subsequently named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by

66

the World Health Organization (WHO) (3). On January 23, 2020, the central

67

government of the People's Republic of China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan in an

68

effort to quarantine the epicenter of the outbreak to prevent an epidemic. Subsequently,

69

two other cities, Enzhou and Chibi, were also locked down. Most recently, on January

70

29, 2020 the WHO has declared the 2019-nCoV a global health emergency.

71

In this ongoing severe case of escalating infections and deaths, healthcare

72

providers in China are working around the clock treating patients and preventing

73

casualties, while scientists in China and around the globe are racing to find out more

74

about the coronavirus to prevent it becoming a worldwide pandemic. Studies published

75

in the past weeks have led to a better worldwide understanding of the epidemiology,

76

clinical and genomic characteristics of the 2019-nCoV (4,5). However, counteracting

77

the newly discovered 2019-nCoV will entail multifaceted control strategies. Global

78

outbreaks like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the

79

2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) have brought attention to the importance of

80

understanding community responses in outbreak control (6).Understanding local

81

community responses is vital to provide insights into the development of risk

82

communication messages to the general public for outbreak prevention and control

83

(6,7).Therefore, investigating the public response to the outbreak is as equally

84

important as epidemiological, clinical, and genomic research.

85

The lesson learned from the recent 2018-2019 Ebola outbreak suggests that

86

institutional trust is of central importance in effective public health intervention (8).

87

Lack of institutional trust may lead to refusal to comply with a preventive or curative

88

intervention which may result in an increased risk of both acquiring and spreading the

89

disease (8). As noted in the statement from the second meeting of the Emergency

90

Committee regarding the outbreak of 2019-nCoV on January 30, the implementation

91

of comprehensive risk communication strategies to enhance public health measures for

92

containment of the outbreak is vital (9).Therefore, it is of utmost importance that people

93

in the epicenter, particularly in the quarantine area, have full trust in the government

94

institutions to enable successful delivery of risk communication and practice of health

95

protection behaviors.

96

Currently, over a month since the onset of the 2019-nCoV, the epidemic is still

97

spreading rapidly with escalating confirmed cases and deaths. In consideration of the

98

importance of understanding the community responses, this study aimed to investigate

99

the role of institutional trust in individual preventive and treatment-seeking behaviors

100

during the 2019-nCoV outbreak, which to date has claimed over 1000 lives and has

101

infected over 60,000 people in China.

102

Methods

103

Study design and participants

104

An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey commenced on January 29,

105

2020. The study population comprised adults ≥18 years of age and residing or working

106

in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. This cross-sectional study

107

was performed in accordance with the STROBE statement.

108

Procedures

109

A snowballing sampling technique was used to recruit the participants. The weblink to

110

the survey was first circulated to the academic staff and students at the Ningbo Medical

111

University, who are from diverse geographical locations of origin. They were instructed

112

to employ their social networks to circulate the link to people residing or working in

113

the province of Hubei. Upon completing the survey, a note to encourage participants to

114

disseminate the survey link to all known contacts in Hubei province was included.

115

Participants were remunerated upon completion of the survey.

116

The questionnaire was developed in English and translated into Chinese.

117

Independent experts reviewed and validated the translation. The questionnaire was also

118

face validated by local experts and pilot tested. The survey consisted of sections that

119

assessed demographic background, institutional trust, and 2019-nCoV-related

120

preventive and health-seeking behaviors.

121

Institutional trust was assessed using a series of questions (eight items) that

122

assessed participants’ trust in 2019-nCoV-related information (i.e. the reported number

123

of confirmed cases, deaths, etc.) and preventive instructions (i.e. self-quarantine,

124

provincial quarantine, extended time off, etc.) given by the local, provincial, and central

125

governments. They were also queried about their trust in the information provision and

126

the preventive instructions from healthcare providers. The response options were

127

recorded on a 4-point Likert scale with items scored as either 0 (not at all), 1 (a small

128

extent), 2 (moderate), or 3 (a great extent). The possible score ranged from 0 to 24, with

129

higher scores indicating higher levels of trust.

130

The section on Preventive behaviors consisted of five parts (14-items), namely: (1)

131

direct avoidance, (2) social interaction avoidance, (3) physical contact avoidance, (4)

132

public space avoidance, and (5) personal protection. The response options were

133

recorded on a 3-point Likert scale with items scored as either 0 (never), 1 (occasionally),

134

or 2 (frequently). The possible score ranged from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating

135

higher levels of preventive behaviors.

136

The section on health-seeking behaviors queried participants about the health-

137

seeking behaviors that they would adopt if they suspected themselves to have been

138

infected with 2019-n CoV. The health-seeking behaviors queried were 1) seeking

139

treatment in the hospital, 2) traditional healing, and 3) self-healing (i.e. exercise, high

140

dose of vitamins, plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables). The answers included two

141

options, “yes” and “no”.

142

Statistical analyses

143

Normality testing was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The scores of

144

institutional trust and preventive behaviors were not normally distributed, therefore all

145

results were expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Other descriptive

146

statistics, such as frequency tables, charts, and proportions were used for data

147

summarization. The reliability of the institutional trust and preventive behavior items

148

was evaluated by assessing the internal consistency of the items representing the scores.

149

The 8-item institutional trust and the 14-item preventive behaviors had a reliability

150

(Cronbach’s α) of 0.944 and 0.653, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was

151

used to determine factors influencing preventive behavior scores and conventional

152

treatment-seeking. Variables that were significant on a chi-square (2) test were

153

selected for multivariable logistic regression analysis and included in the model using

154

a simultaneous forced-entry method. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95%

155

CI), and p values were calculated for each independent variable. The model fit was

156

assessed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.10 All statistical analyses

157

were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20.0 (IBM

158

Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A p‐value of less than 0·05 was considered statistically

159

significant.

160

Ethics Approval

161

This survey was part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation and thus

162

considered exempt from institutional review board approval.

to all of the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for

167

168

Results

169

The survey link was disseminated on January 29, 2020, and by January 30 a total of

170

4,393 responses were received. The final number of responses included in data analyses

171

was 4,245, after data cleaning to remove invalid responses. The demographic

172

characteristics of the participants are shown in the first column of Table 1. Most of the

173

participants were from the city of Wuhan (67.3%) and most (93.6%) reported that they

174

were currently under quarantine.

175

Figure 1 shows the results of institutional trust for both information provision and

176

preventive instruction. The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust

177

in the information provision (72.4%) and preventive instructions (78.5%) from the

178

central government authority. The level of trust in the information provision (68.4%)

179

and preventive instruction (72.1%) from healthcare providers were lower than that of

180

the central government authority. An even lower proportion expressed a great extent of

181

trust in information provision (48.0%) and preventive instructions (59.7%) given by the

182

local authority. The total scores of institutional trust for information provision and

183

preventive instruction ranged from 0 to 24. The median score was 22 (IQR 18 to 24).

184

The total scores was categorized into two groups, namely 22-24 or 0-21, based on the

185

median split; as such, a total of 2,208 (52.0%) were categorized as having a score of

186

22-24 and 2,037 (48.0%) had a score of 0-21.

187

Figure 2 shows the distribution of self-reported preventive behaviors. The uptake

188

of preventive behaviors was high in the study population. However, only 40% reported

189

wearing a face mask at home when they were with other household members. The

190

scores of preventive behaviors in the study population ranged from 7 to 28. The median

191

score was 27 (IQR 26-28). The preventive behaviors scores were categorized as a score

192

of 27 to 28 or 7 to 26 based on the median split; as such, a total of 2321 (54·7%) were

193

categorized as having a score of 27 to 28 and 1924 (45·3%) had a score of 7 to 26.

194

Table 1 shows the univariate and multivariable analyses of factors associated with

195

preventive behavior scores. In the univariate analysis, there were significant

196

associations between the preventive behavior scores and age group, highest educational

197

attainment, occupational types, quarantine status, and the total score of institutional

198

trust. In the multivariate analysis, under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2·35,

199

95% confidence interval [CI] 1·80 - 3·08) and having high institutional trust score

200

(OR=2·23, 95% CI 1·96 -2·53) were two strong significant determinants of higher

201

preventive behavior scores. Participants of age group 26-35 years (OR=1·54, 95% CI

202

1·29 -1·83) and 36-45 years (OR=1·22, 95% CI 1·01 - 1·48) had significantly higher

203

preventive behaviour scores than those >45 years old.

204

Figure 3 shows the treatment-seeking behaviours of the study population. Most

205

participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek treatment at the hospital,

206

whereas 42% (n = 1,782) reported that they would seek traditional healing, and 62.4%

207

(n = 2,651) reported a preference for self-treatment. A total of 462 (46.3%) participants

208

aged >45 years reported a preference for using traditional healing (2 = 13.649, degrees

209

of freedom = 3, p = 0.011). There was no significant difference in the use of self-healing

210

by participants’ age. Table 2 shows the univariate and multivariable analyses of factors

211

associated with treatment-seeking in the hospital. In the univariate analysis all of the

212

factors studied, except for the age group, were significantly associated with treatment-

213

seeking in the hospital. Of note, 16.6% (n = 475) of the participants from the city of

214

Wuhan reported no intention of seeking treatment in the hospital, whereas 13.8% (n =

215

550) of participants who were in the quarantine area reported no intention of seeking

216

treatment in the hospital. In the multivariable analysis, similarly, being quarantined

217

(OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80–3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20,

218

95% CI 1.96–2.49) were two strong significant determinants of treatment-seeking in

219

the hospital.

220

Discussion

221

With the aim of understanding the public behaviour in prevention measures in this crisis

222

that has now become a worldwide concern, this study collected data at the 2019n-CoV

223

outbreak epicentres during a period of exponential growth of the epidemic. This study

224

found a considerably high level of institutional trust among the public in the epicenters.

225

However, trust in the local authority was lower than that in the provincial and central

226

government. This finding is in contrast to the study on the Ebola outbreak in Congo,

227

where their public expressed higher trust in their local authorities (8). There is a need

228

to enhance trust in the local authority, as they are the frontline in service delivery during

229

the outbreak. Lack of trust in the local authority results in poor cooperation, thus

230

undermining contact tracing and adherence to recommended public health interventions

231

(11,12). Healthcare providers can be strong advocates for outbreak prevention efforts

232

in these communities, considering that many expressed a high level of trust in them.

233

On a positive note, this study revealed that the people in the epicenters adopted a

234

high level of prevention measures. As noted, however, a relatively small proportion

235

reported using face masks at home when they were around household members.

236

Wearing a face mask in public places and at home when around other household

237

members is advisable based on CDC recommendations (13). In consideration that

238

human-to-human transmission among close family members has been reported in

239

overseas countries such as Germany, Japan, and Vietnam, the community in Hubei

240

province and the epicenters should be made aware of the essential importance of

241

wearing face masks when they are around other household members.

242

The main strength of this study is the finding of the strong influence of institutional

243

trust on overall preventive behaviors, in good agreement with previous studies (8,11).

244

As the 2019-nCoV epidemic is still growing exponentially, continued strengthening of

245

institutional trust, and in particular, increasing the trust in the local authority, is essential

246

for emergency management. outbreak control.

247

The study also found that uptake of prevention practices was poorer among older

248

members of the public, which warrants serious attention. It has been found that older

249

adults affected by 2019-nCoV are likely to have a higher risk of complications and

250

mortality (4). There is a need to find out whether a lack of appropriate prevention

251

practices among people of older age is due to knowledge deficiency or to their being

252

out-of-reach of current public health intervention.

The finding that nearly 15% of people would be reluctant to seek treatment in the

hospital if they were suspected to have been infected with 2019-nCoV is clinically

255

important and worrisome. Of utmost importance, a proportion of those participants are

256

in the city of Wuhan and currently under quarantine. The preference for using

257

traditional healing among a minority of the older respondents is also of concern. Refusal

258

to seek hospital treatment not only leads to progress to serious respiratory distress and

259

can be life-threatening, but also increases the chances of spreading the disease. People

260

who favor traditional healing should be made aware that seeking conventional

261

treatment in the hospital and obeying the quarantine order are the most appropriate

262

actions in containing this outbreak. Finally, the finding of the strong influence of

263

institutional trust on seeking conventional treatment again amplifies the immense

264

importance of building trust between the public and the government authorities.

265

This current study has several limitations that should be considered. The first

266

pertains to the cross-sectional nature of the study. Thus, it cannot be used to infer

267

causality. Second, the responses were based on self-report and may be subject to self-

268

reporting bias and a tendency to report socially desirable responses. Therefore, the

269

results should be interpreted with caution. Third, the snowballing method used in this

270

study can lead to selection bias. Nevertheless, the demographic distributions of our

271

study population resembles of the general population in Hubei province. Despite

272

these limitations, the study data contributes tremendously to understanding of public

273

responses, especially now that the epidemic is growing exponentially.

274

In conclusion, bridging the trust gaps between the public and local authorities in

275

the epicentres is crucial. It is of utmost urgency to carry out public health interventions

276

to reach out to individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are

277

reluctant to seek conventional medical care. Considering the extremely contagious

278

nature of the 2019-nCoV, a slight incompliance by even a small portion of the

279

population may have grave consequences and contribute to the continued exponential

280

increase of the outbreak cases.
