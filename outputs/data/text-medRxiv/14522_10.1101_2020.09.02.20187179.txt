Abstract
Objectives: COVID-19 has caused a large global pandemic. Patients with COVID-19
exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide
association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and
prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely
unclear.
Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR)
method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various
outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and
hospitalized COVID-19.
Results: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057
tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (β
[SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75×10-06 and β [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76×10-06, respectively).
Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both
blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in
inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2
and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation.
Conclusions: We identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved
in the susceptibility or prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important
leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine storm and venous
thromboembolism in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets for the effective
treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created a large global
pandemic and poses a serious threat to public health (1, 2). As of August 7, 2020,
there were more than 19.3 million confirmed cases worldwide, with the total deaths
exceeding 719,830 (3). SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic and transmissible
coronavirus that primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact (4).
Seeking solutions to control the spread of COVID-19 and exploring effective
treatments are of utmost importance to address the global challenge posed by COVID19. Therefore, there is pressing urgency to further identify the pathological
mechanisms underlying COVID-19.
Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior.
Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify
genetic variants associated with diagnosis of and prognosis of COVID-19 (5, 6), but
biological interpretation of their findings remains largely unclear. Previous research
found that approximately 88% of trait-associated genetic variants detected by GWAS
resided in non-coding regions of the genome and might have regulatory functions on
gene expression (7). In the context of COVID-19 research, it is therefore important to
explore genes whose expressions were pleiotropically/potentially causally associated
with susceptibility or the development of COVID-19.
Different from conventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Mendelian
randomization (MR), which uses genetic variants as the proxy to randomization (8), is

a promising tool to search for pleotropic/potentially causal effect of an exposure (e.g.,
gene expression) on the outcome (e.g., COVID-19 susceptibility). MR minimizes
confounding and reverse causation that are commonly encountered in traditional
association studies (8, 9), and has been successful in identifying gene expression sites
or DNA methylation loci that are pleiotropically/potentially causally associated with
various phenotypes, such as cardiovascular diseases, BMI, and rheumatoid arthritis
(10-13).
In this paper, we applied the summary data-based MR (SMR) method integrating
summarized GWAS data for COVID-19 and cis- eQTL (expression quantitative trait
loci) data to prioritize genes that are pleiotropically/potentially causally associated
with the risk and prognosis of COVID-19.

Methods
Data sources
eQTL data
In the SMR analysis, cis-eQTL genetic variants were used as the instrumental
variables (IVs) for gene expression. We performed SMR analysis for gene expression
in blood and lung separately. For blood, we used the CAGE eQTL summarized data
(14), which included 2765 participants. For lung, we used the V7 release of the GTEx
eQTL summarized data (15), which included 278 participants. The eQTL data for
blood and lung can be downloaded at

GWAS data for COVID-19
The GWAS summarized data were provided by the COVID-19 host genetics initiative
(6) and can be downloaded at https://www.covid19hg.org/results/. Three phenotypes
were examined, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19, COVID-19 and
hospitalized COVID-19. Details on definition of the phenotypes can be found in
Table S1. The control groups were subjects from the general population without the
specific phenotype, subjects who were COVID-19 negative based on prediction or
self-report, or subjects who had COVID-19 without hospitalization, making a total of
five comparisons: severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 (n=536) vs. population
(n=329,391; hereafter severe COVID-19); COVID-19 (n=6,696) vs. population
(n=1073072; hereafter COVID-19), COVID-19 (n=3,523) vs. COVID-19 negative
(n=36,634; hereafter COVID-19 negative); hospitalized COVID-19 (n=3,199) vs.
population (n=897,488; hereafter hospitalized COVID-19), and hospitalized COVID19 (n=928) vs. COVID-19 without hospitalization (n=2,028; hereafter COVID-19
without hospitalization). In addition, we repeated the SMR analysis for severe
respiratory confirmed COVID-19 using GWAS summarized data from the Severe
COVID-19 GWAS Group (5) (hereafter severe COVID-19 NEJM). The study
included 1,160 patients who had severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19, and 2,205
participants from the general population without COVID-19 as the control (Table 1).
The definition of severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 in this study was different
from the one as defined by the COVID-19 host genetics initiative (Table S1). The
GWAS summarized data can be downloaded at https://ikmb.shinyapps.io/COVID6

SMR analysis
MR was undertaken with cis-eQTL as the IV, gene expression as the exposure, and
each of the three phenotypes as the outcome (in comparison with different control
groups). MR analysis was done using the method as implemented in the software
SMR. Detailed information regarding the SMR method was reported in a previous
publication (10). In brief, SMR applies the principles of MR to jointly analyze GWAS
and eQTL summary statistics in order to test for pleotropic association between gene
expression and a trait due to a shared and potentially causal variant at a locus. The
heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test was performed to evaluate the
existence of linkage in the observed association. Rejection of the null hypothesis (i.e.,
PHEIDI<0.05) indicates that the observed association might be due to two distinct
genetic variants in high linkage disequilibrium with each other. We adopted the
default settings in SMR (e.g., PeQTL <5 × 10-8, minor allele frequency [MAF] > 0.01,
removing SNPs in very strong linkage disequilibrium [LD, r2 > 0.9] with the top
associated eQTL, and removing SNPs in low LD or not in LD [r2 <0.05] with the top
associated eQTL), and used false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple testing.
Annotations of transcripts were based on the Affymetrix exon array S1.0
platforms. To functionally annotate putative transcripts, we conducted functional
enrichment analysis using the functional annotation tool “Metascape” (16) for the top
tagged genes in blood and lung, separately. Gene symbols corresponding to putative
genes (P<0.05) were used as the input of the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto

Data cleaning and statistical/bioinformatical analysis was performed using R
version 4.0.0 (https://www.r-project.org/), PLINK 1.9 (https://www.coggenomics.org/plink/1.9/) and SMR (https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/).
Results
Basic information of the summarized data
The number of cases and controls varied dramatically among different analyses. The
number of probes were approximately 8,500 and 5,500 in the analysis for blood and
lung, respectively. The detailed information was shown in Table 1.

SMR analysis in blood
Information of the top 5 probes for each phenotype was presented in Table 2. Using
GWAS summarized data from the COVID-19 host genetics initiative, we identified 2
probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed
pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (β [SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75×1006

and β [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76×10-06, respectively), but no significant pleiotropic

association for other phenotypes after correction for multiple testing (Figure 1,
Figure S1-5). The same two probes were also among the top 5 probes in the analysis
of severe COVID-19 NEJM and COVID-19, although they did not reach statistical
significance after correction for multiple testing (Table 2). In addition, we found that
multiple probes tagging TRIM5 were among the top 5 probes in the analysis of severe
COVID-19 NEJM and hospitalized COVID-19 in blood.

GO enrichment analysis of biological process and molecular function showed
that the genes tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in four GO terms, including
regulation of type I interferon-mediated signaling pathway (GO: 0060338), regulation
of vesicle-mediated transport (GO: 0060627), response to endoplasmic reticulum
stress (GO: 0034976); and response to oxidative stress (GO:0006979). Multiple genes
as tagged by the top 5 probes, including IFNAR2, TRIM5, NLRC5, MCTP1, PTPN1,
FCER1G, ATF4 and PON2, were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity
(Table S2).

SMR analysis in lung
We didn’t identify any significant pleiotropic association after correction for multiple
testing (Figure S6-11). Information of the top 5 probes for each phenotype was
presented in Table 3. We found that 3 probes tagging AP006621 were among the top
probes in the analysis of severe COVID-19 NEJM (Table 3). In addition, multiple
genes, including C7orf25, ITGAD, FCER1G and ZNF589, were tagged by the top 5
probes in both blood and lung.
The genes tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in two GO terms, including
stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway (GO: 0002223) and leukocyte
activation involved in immune response (GO: 0002366). Multiple genes as tagged by
the top 5 probes, including ARSA, FCER1G, XOSC6 and PSMD13, were involved
inflammation or antiviral immunity (Table S3).

Discussion
In the present study, we integrated GWAS and eQTL data in the MR analysis to
explore putative genes that showed pleiotropic/potentially causal association the
susceptibility/prognosis of COVID-19. We identified 2 probes tagging IFNAR2
showing pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 in blood. Multiple genes
as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation and antiviral immunity
in both blood and lung. Several genes tagged by the top probes were in blood
coagulation. Our findings provided important leads to a better understanding of the
mechanism of cytokine storm and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and
revealed potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of COVID-19.
Interferons (IFNs) refer to a group of signaling proteins made and released by the
host cells in response to viral invasion (17). There are three types of IFNs: type I IFNs
(IFN-α/β), type II IFNs (IFN-γ) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ) (18-20). IFNAR2
(interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 2), located at 21q22.11, encodes one of the
two type I IFNs (21). In the cascade of host’s response to coronavirus, IFNs play an
essential role in the establishment of antiviral state and in intensifying the antiviral
response (22). It was found that IFNs could have both beneficial and detrimental
effect on SARS-Cov-2 replication (23). A recent retrospective study of 77 adults
found that IFN-α2b treatment with or without arbidol significantly reduced the
duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients (24).
However, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommend against the use of
interferons for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19, except in

a clinical trial, due to insufficient data to support the beneficial or detrimental effects
of interferons (25). Because IFNAR2 was tagged by the top 5 probes for multiple
phenotypes, we think that it is likely involved in determining COVID-19 severity and
could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. More studies
are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the dual role of IFNs during
SARS-Cov-2 and whether/how IFNAR2 is involved in this process.
We found that multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in
inflammation. ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) is an endoplasmic reticulum
stress sensor that defends lungs via induction of heme oxygenase 1 (26). ATF4 were
decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from patients with active Crohn’s disease or
active ulcerative colitis, and ATF4 deficiency promotes intestinal inflammation in
mice (27). ATF4 was downregulated in the alveolar type II cells of the elderly,
compared with the young (28). ATF4 has more than 20 candidate downstream factors,
with the majority of them being significantly downregulated in the elderly, who
demonstrated compromised ATF4-dependent ability to respond to endoplasmic
reticulum stress. Lung-specific delivery of ATF4-related antioxidants has the potential
to work in synergy with promising antiviral drugs to further improve COVID-19
outcomes in the elderly (28). Some of the tagged genes, such as TRIM5, NLRC5,
MCTP1, PTPN1, ARSA and FCER1G, are also involved antiviral immunity (29-35).
These genes have not been reported to be associated with COVID-19 in previous
studies.
It was estimated that approximately 40% of COVID-19 patients were considered

as having a high risk of venous thromboembolism risk, and 11% of them developed
venous thromboembolism without prophylaxis (36). Abnormal coagulation in patients
with COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of death (37). Recent research
indicated that dysregulated platelets and neutrophils cooperated to drive a systemic
prothrombotic state in SARS-CoV-2 infection (38). However, the underlying
mechanisms in general, and genetic contributions in particular, remain to be further
explored. In our study, we found two genes, as tagged by the top five probes, that
were involved in blood coagulation: PON2 and HPS5 in the analysis of COVID-19
without hospitalization in blood (Table 2) and severe COVID-19 in lung (Table 3),
respectively. PON2 (paraoxonase 2) encodes a member of the paraoxonase gene
family, and acts as a cellular antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress (39). It
was shown that deregulated redox regulation in PON2 deficiency caused vascular
inflammation and abnormalities in blood coagulation (40). HPS5 encodes a protein
that is involved in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes and platelet
dense granules (41). Mutations in HPS5 are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak
syndrome type 5 (HPS5), a subtype of a series of disorders characterized by
oculocutaneous albinism and prolonged bleeding (42). Although the pleotropic
association was not statistically significant in the SMR analysis after correction for
multiple testing (P=7.56×10-4 for PON2 and 4.21×10-4 for HPS5), our findings
suggested potential involvement of these genes in the pathogenesis of venous
thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients. More studies are needed to explore the
functions of these two genes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our study has some limitations. The GWAS analyses did not control
confounding factors which might affect the outcome. It is also unclear whether
selection of the subjects in the GWAS studies was a representative of the exposureoutcome distributions in the overall population, and therefore, the possibility of
selection bias, which can affect estimation accuracy, could not be ruled out. The
GWAS studies only examined the short-term effect of COVID-19 due to the limited
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we were unable to assess the long-term
outcomes/lingering effects of COVID-19. Similarly, we could not analyze the genetic
contribution of other interesting phenotypes, such as different disease behaviors
among children/teens, adults and the elderly patients, and asymptomatic COVID-19,
due to a lack of the corresponding GWAS summarized data. We only performed
analyses using blood and lung eQTL data, more studies are needed to explore tissueand cell-type-specific genes involved in the host responses to COVID-19 infection.
Due to a lack of individual eQTL data, we could not quantify the changes in gene
expression in patients with COVID-19 in comparison with the control.
Conclusion
We identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved in the
susceptibility/prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important leads to a
better understanding of the mechanism of cytokine storm in COVID-19 and reveals
potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of COVID-19.

Figure 1. Prioritizing genes around IFNAR2 in association with hospitalized
COVID-19 in blood.
Top plot, grey dots represent the -log10(P values) for SNPs from the GWAS of
hospitalized COVID-19, and rhombuses represent the -log10(P values) for probes
from the SMR test with solid rhombuses indicating that the probes pass HEIDI test
and hollow rhombuses indicating that the probes do not pass the HEIDI test. Middle
plot, eQTL results in blood for two probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057
probes, tagging IFNAR2. Bottom plot, location of genes tagged by the probes.
Highlighted in maroon indicates probes that pass SMR threshold.

The GWAS summarized data were provided by the COVID-19 host genetics initiative (6) and the control is the population unless otherwise noted. The
eQTL data for lung (15) can be downloaded at https://cnsgenomics.com/data/SMR/#eQTLsummarydata.
#
Summary data were provided by the Severe Covid-19 GWAS Group (5).
¶
The control is the non-predicted and non-self-reported COVID-19.
§
The control is COVID-19 without hospitalization, including laboratory confirmed or self-reported COVID-19.
PeQTL is the P value of the top associated cis-eQTL in the eQTL analysis, and PGWAS is the P value for the top associated cis-eQTL in the GWAS analysis. Beta
is the estimated effect size in SMR analysis, SE is the corresponding standard error, PSMR is the P value for SMR analysis, PHEIDI is the P value for the HEIDI
test and Nsnp is the number of SNPs involved in the HEIDI test.
CHR, chromosome; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; HEIDI, heterogeneity in dependent instruments; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; SMR,
summary data-based Mendelian randomization; QTL, quantitative trait loci
