Background: Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) increase mortality risk from coronavirus
infection(COVID-19), but there are concerns that the pandemic has affected supply and
demand of acute cardiovascular care. We estimated excess mortality in specific CVDs, both
“direct”, through infection, and “indirect”, through changes in healthcare.

Methods: We used population-based electronic health records from 3,862,012 individuals in
England to estimate pre- and post-COVID-19 mortality risk(“direct” effect) for people with
incident and prevalent CVD. We incorporated: (i)pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and
comorbidities, (ii)estimated population COVID-19 prevalence, and (iii)estimated relative
impact of COVID-19 on mortality(relative risk, RR: 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). For “indirect” effects, we
analysed weekly mortality and emergency department data for England/Wales and monthly
hospital data from England(n=2), China(n=5) and Italy(n=1) for CVD referral, diagnosis and
treatment until 1 May 2020.

Findings: CVD service activity decreased by 60-100% compared with pre-pandemic levels
in eight hospitals across China, Italy and England during the pandemic. In China, activity
remained below pre-COVID-19 levels for 2-3 months even after easing lockdown, and is still
reduced in Italy and England. Mortality data suggest indirect effects on CVD will be delayed
rather than contemporaneous(peak RR 1.4). For total CVD(incident and prevalent), at 10%
population COVID-19 rate, we estimated direct impact of 31,205 and 62,410 excess deaths
in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0 respectively, and indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess
deaths.

Interpretation: Supply and demand for CVD services have dramatically reduced across
countries with potential for substantial, but avoidable, excess mortality during and after the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has had unplanned consequences for non-COVID-19
health services. We described reductions in urgent cancer referrals and chemotherapy
compared to pre-COVID-19 levels1. Decreases in presentation and treatment of myocardial
infarction(MI)2-4 in Italy and the USA suggest effects on care, but services have not been
studied across specific CVDs, countries or different phases of the pandemic.

Early reports from Wuhan, China, demonstrated high prevalence of and mortality from
COVID-19 in individuals with CVD; confirmed across countries, particularly with coronary
heart disease(CHD) and heart failure(HF)5-8. UK government policy for “physical distancing”
in high-risk subgroups for COVID-19, announced on 16 March 2020, included CVD,
especially HF9. On 22 March 2020, a further 1.5 million people in England(with ‘extremely
vulnerable’ conditions) were recommended at least 12 weeks of ‘shielding’10, excluding
those with CVD, prior to UK lockdown on 23 March11. Better understanding of pre- and postCOVID-19 mortality risk across specific CVDs may help decisions and policies regarding
physical isolation.

Therefore, effects of COVID-19 on individuals and health systems are: (i)direct due to
infection, and (ii)indirect due to unprecedented system strain and associated behaviour
changes12. Those with CVD, carrying the greatest burden of global morbidity and mortality13,
are likely to be particularly affected. Beyond direct effects, systematic examination of recent
and longer-term trends for CVD services may help in planning the timing and nature of exit
from lockdown and strategies for any subsequent infection peaks. Moreover, reductions in
rates of referral, diagnosis, and treatment, may have fatal long-term consequences, caused
by “supply”(e.g. lower healthcare availability) and/or “demand”(e.g. delayed presentation),
but have not been investigated. Electronic health records(EHR) have been used in studies
across different specific CVDs14, and enable novel insights regarding direct and indirect
COVID-19-related excess deaths, across incident and prevalent CVD, and the spectrum of
care.

Objective: We used: (i)national mortality data for England and Wales to investigate trends in
non-COVID-19 and CVD excess deaths; (ii)routine data from hospitals in England, Italy and
China to assess indirect effects on services for referral, diagnosis and treatment of CVD
during the pandemic; and (iii)population-based EHR in England to investigate pre-COVID-19
mortality by underlying risk factors and excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Data sources and study population
To estimate pre-COVID-19 incidence and mortality in individuals with CVD and
comorbidities, we used EHR across primary care(Clinical Practice Research Datalink,
CPRD-GOLD), hospital care(Hospital Episodes Statistics, HES), and death registry(Office of
National Statistics, ONS) with prospective recording and follow-up; linked by CPRD and
NHS Digital using unique healthcare identifiers15. Over 99% of England’s population is
registered with general practice(GP). CPRD is representative by socio-demography,
ethnicity and overall mortality16. Eligible individuals were aged ≥30 years, registered with a
GP between 1 January 1997 and 1 January 2017 with ≥1 year of follow-up. Study entry was
1 year following latest GP registration for each individual, to more completely capture past
medical history.

Open-access electronic health record phenotypes
We defined non-fatal(alive for ≥30 days post-diagnosis) CVD using 16 previously validated
CALIBER phenotypes: stable angina, unstable angina, MI, CHD unspecified, HF, cardiac
arrest, transient ischaemic attack(TIA), ischaemic stroke, stroke unspecified, intracerebral
haemorrhage,

subarachnoid

haemorrhage,

peripheral

arterial

disease(PAD),

atrial

fibrillation(AF), abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA), DVT and pulmonary embolism(PE), as per
prior studies14-16. We included DVT and PE due to clinical importance of venous
thromboembolism in COVID-1917. Incident and prevalent CVD were defined by first CVD
record in the study period with no prior CVD history, and first prior CVD history, respectively.
Validated phenotype definitions of diseases and COVID-19-relevant conditions(available at
https://caliberresearch.org/portal)14-16 were generated from hospital and primary care
information recorded in primary care, using Read clinical terminology(version 2).

We defined 15 comorbidities or comorbidity clusters involving 40 individual conditions
associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes by UK government guidance9,10. Further details
are provided in Supplementary Methods. Multimorbidity was co-occurrence of ≥2 of these
conditions18.

Weekly/monthly information on CVD care and mortality

CVD in two UK hospitals(University College London NHS Trust, and King’s College Hospital
London NHS Foundation Trust); and (iii)hospital data in China(n=5; Wuhan Union Hospital,
Zaoyang First Hospital, Xiangyang First Hospital, Xiantao People’s Hospital, Tianmen First
Hospital) and Italy(n=1; Ospedale Santa Maria delle Croci, Ravenna). For all data, weekly or
monthly relative risks(RRs) were calculated compared with the pre-lockdown data(from 3
January). Further details of data and RR calculations are given in the Supplementary
Methods.

Estimating incidence rates and 1-year mortality
We estimated incidence rates per 100,000 person-years and pre-COVID-19 1-year mortality
risk for incident and prevalent CVD using Kaplan-Meier analyses stratified by specific CVD
and number of (non-CVD) comorbidities(0, 1, 2 and 3+), scaling up from CALIBER(3.8
million individuals) to the whole population of England aged 30+, consisting of 35,407,313
individuals(using 2018 estimates of overall population size and mortality21).

Estimating 1-year direct and indirect excess deaths
Excess deaths were considered as direct(due or with COVID-19 infection) or indirect(due to
changes in health services). Direct excess deaths were estimated by applying RRs of 1.2,
1.5, 2 and 3, based on published hazard ratios for CVD and COVID-19 deaths8,22,23, in the
absence of cohort studies of clinical cohorts of CVD patients investigating all-cause mortality
in those with and without infection. We modelled 10% infection rate based on recent COVID19 seroprevalence estimates24-25. Although infection rate will change depending on
pandemic phase, we assumed infection rate over 1 year in line with the first wave.
Given service changes in CVD observed across countries2-4, to capture direct and indirect
excess deaths, we modelled in addition to the 10% infected, 40% and 80% affected rates,
where 30% and 70% of the population respectively would be un-infected but affected at
corresponding RRs. Based on RRs from ONS data(peak RR 1.14 for excess CVD deaths
and 1.29 for excess non-COVID-19 deaths; Figure 2) and likely longer-term effects on CVD
mortality, we estimated direct and indirect excess deaths together by applying RR 1.2 to
40% and 80% of the population. Thus, we provide low(infection rate 10% and no indirect
effect at RR 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0), medium(infection rate 10% and 30% indirectly affected at RR
1.2) and high estimates(infection rate 10% and 70% indirectly affected at RR 1.2) of excess
deaths. We projected excess death estimates to the whole English population, we used the
2018 population estimate of 35,407,313 individuals aged ≥3021. All analyses were performed
using R(version 3.4.3).

Results
Monthly hospital data across countries
In China (both Wuhan and other hospitals) and Italy, activity(referral, diagnosis and
treatment) was significantly reduced compared with pre-COVID levels. In Wuhan, there was
83.4% reduction in referral, 92% in diagnosis and 99% in treatment levels of MI by the 1
February, a month after the outbreak started. Corresponding decreases were 92%, 97% and
87% for stroke, 83%, 93% and 98% for HF, and 83%, 95% and 94% for AF. Tianmen and
Xiantao demonstrated equivalent decreases across all four disease services. Although
decreases were relatively less in Zaoyang and Xiangtang, there were 40-80% reductions
across services, except for diagnosis of MI which increased in Zaoyang between January
and March.

Even after easing and stopping of lockdown, Wuhan reported 50-100% decreases in
services for MI, stroke, HF and AF. In other Chinese hospitals, activity had mostly returned
to pre-COVID levels by April 2020. Recovery of activity began to occur during the lockdown
period and differed across Chinese hospitals, suggesting possible differences in infection
rates, patient presentation and behaviour, clinician behaviour and COVID-19-related system
strain. In Italy, decreases ranged from 45% for stroke treatment to 94% for HF treatment and
100% for AF diagnosis. In England, there was reduced activity across CVDs during the
pandemic. Services in Italy and England had not reached pre-COVID levels even by the
easing of lockdown. Across countries, referral rates for all diseases and treatment of MI were
particularly affected and declines in activity occurred before the peak of cases or
deaths(Figure 1).

Weekly national mortality data and emergency attendance data
Non-COVID-19 and CVD-related deaths in England and Wales increased in the same
chronology as total(including COVID-19) deaths until mid-May 2020(compared with the
same week over the last 5 years). The peak observed RR for CVD deaths was in the week
ending 24 April(1850 vs 1626 deaths, RR 1.14) and the lowest in the week ending 8 May
2020(1318 vs 1487 deaths, RR 0.89). The same trend was present regardless of whether
the RR was calculated compared to the average of previous years, or pre-COVID-19(3
January 2020). Between 6 and 27 March, cardiac ED attendances decreased in
England(minimum RR 0.57) and were had not fully recovered on 15 May, which was after
easing of lockdown(Figure 2).

Of 3,862,012 individuals in our English cohort, 538,037 had incident CVD and 580,437 had
prevalent CVD. Age-adjusted incidence rates(per 100,000 population) were highest for
AF(330), CHD(261), HF(168), stable angina(140), and DVT(139)(Figure S1). For incident
CVDs, 1-mortality rates varied by specific CVD: 58.4% for cardiac arrest, 42.1% for
intracerebral haemorrhage, 30.3% for HF, 20.1% for MI, 12.1% for CHD, 4.8% for stable
angina,. Absolute 1-year mortality was highest for AF(234,778), HF(173,955), CHD(114,383)
and stroke(63,276). Mortality rates were relatively lower for prevalent CVDs(Figure S2).

Comorbidities in individuals with CVD
Across incident and prevalent CVDs, prevalence of 0, 1, 2 and 3+ co-morbidities was 26.2%
and 27.1%, 33.2% and 36.3%, 21.9% and 20.5%, 18.6% and 16.2% respectively. Across
CVDs, hypertension, CKD, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and
diabetes were commonest(Supplementary Table 1, Figure S3). Comorbidity profiles were
similar in those with prevalent CVD(Figure S4). Multimorbidity was associated with
increased 1-year mortality, e.g. in incident AF, 1-year mortality was 31% vs 9% in men and
34% vs 16% in women for ≥3 vs 0 conditions. One-year mortality risks were >50% in those
with incident cardiac arrest or intracerebral haemorrhage and ≥3 conditions(Figures 3B and
S5B).

Estimates for direct and indirect excess 1-year COVID-19-related deaths
For incident CVD, at 10% infection rate, there would be 5067, 10,135 and 20,269 excess
deaths at RR 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 respectively. At 40% and 80% infection rates, we estimated
8112 and 16225 excess deaths at RR 1.2 (Figure 4A).

For prevalent CVD, at 10% infection rate, there would be 26,138, 52,275 and 104,550
excess deaths at RR 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 respectively. At 40% and 80% infection rates, we
estimated 41820 and 83640 excess deaths at RR 1.2(Figure 5A).

For total CVD(incident and prevalent combined), at 10% infection rate, we estimated a direct
effect of 31,205, 62,410, and 124, 819 excess deaths at RR, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 respectively.
For total CVD, we estimate an indirect effect of 49932 to 99865 excess deaths using 40%
and 80% infection rate estimates.

For incident CVD, at 10% COVID-19 rate, we estimated 2508 vs 1068, 5016 vs 2136 and
10033 vs 4272 excess deaths in multimorbidity compared with no comorbidities at RR 1.5,
2.0 and 3.0 respectively. At 40% COVID-19 rate, we estimated 4013 vs 1709 excess deaths;
and at 80% COVID-19 rate, we estimated 8026 vs 3417 excess deaths in multimorbidity

compared with no comorbidities at corresponding RRs(Figure 4B). Among those with
prevalent CVDs, we estimated higher excess deaths at 1 year than for incident CVDs with
similar associations with number of comorbidities(Figure 5B).

Discussion
This first analysis from large-scale population-based EHR across 16 specific CVDs and
multimorbidity in the COVID-19 context has four findings. First, profound disruption of CVD
services across referral, diagnosis and treatment(seen in UK, Italy and China) may
contribute to excess deaths. Second, there are high rates of “high-risk” and “extremely
vulnerable” conditions among people with CVD, often in combination, varying by specific
CVD. Third, we predict significant excess deaths in individuals with CVD, over a 1-year time
horizon partly because indirect effects may be delayed. Fourth, excess deaths in prevalent
and incident CVD, by direct and indirect effects, suggest that access to acute and chronic
CVD care should be prioritised during future pandemic waves.

Professional organisations quickly produced evidence-based CVD management guidelines
in the COVID-19 context26. Our analysis highlights the pandemic’s real and potential impact
on CVD healthcare provision in different countries at different stages in their responses. At
peak, almost all CVD healthcare activity collapsed in Wuhan. Although Italy and the UK were
affected later, CVD services were, and still are, compromised in pre-lockdown and lockdown
phases. Changes in CVD excess deaths have not yet been observed in ONS data,
suggesting that indirect effects may manifest over at least a year, rather than
contemporaneously with activity reductions observed across countries. Overall, these data
emphasise indirect effects of COVID-19, helping to quantify and model true “relative impact”,
and relative contributions of pandemic versus lockdown on CVD services. We believe
countries should monitor near real-time service activity, and COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
deaths27 over the coming year to understand and mitigate excess deaths in individuals with
CVD, especially in those countries still at earlier phases, such as Brazil.

There is debate about which conditions should be on “high-risk” and “extremely vulnerable”
lists of conditions for physical isolation policies, which should include some CVDs and
combinations of comorbidities, based on our risk estimates and COVID-death data todate6,12. CVD is known to have high prevalence, incidence and mortality, varying by arterial
territory. We now show that AF, CHD, HF, stable angina, and DVT have the highest preCOVID-19 incidence rates. Prognosis varies by incident versus prevalent disease, specific
CVD and number and combination of comorbidities, highlighting need for individualised risk

prediction across CVD. On a different note, our findings also bring into question the rationale
for looking at composite endpoints such as “MACE”(major adverse cardiovascular events) in
trials and other studies due to highly variable risk across specific CVD28.

In individuals with CVD at 10% population infection rate, there would be 50,937 excess
deaths at RR 1.5, with higher rates at higher infection rates. An earlier lockdown, as in New
Zealand or the Indian state of Kerala, minimises overall deaths. Conversely, in countries
such as the UK and USA, delayed lockdown may exacerbate direct and indirect effects of
COVID-19, supported by rising non-COVID-19 deaths in ONS data. COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 deaths can be avoided by: (i)acting early and reducing infection rates by
widespread testing, stringent physical isolation and suppression policies, and (ii) focusing on
the preventable CVD burden. For example, HF, MI, ischaemic stroke and AF are prevalent
conditions with highest mortality rates; all with evidence-based therapies. The same is true
for common CVD comorbidities, which often occur in clusters: hypertension, CKD, cancer,
COPD and diabetes, underlining importance of integrated CVD and risk factor management
pre- and post-COVID-19.

Our findings may have implications for which aspects of health services(acute vs chronic,
treatment vs prevention, across specific CVDs) require attention at different pandemic
phases. Demand for NCD care is documented in humanitarian emergencies29, but NCD
surveillance is absent in pandemic preparedness, planning and responses, particularly in
low-middle income countries13, where our findings will be magnified. The learning health
system concept30, where near real-time data inform science, evidence and care, has not
been used optimally during the COVID-19 pandemic, but our CVD referral, diagnosis and
treatment data show that data need not be complex.

Strengths and limitations
Our study uses large-scale, nationally representative EHR with validated definitions across a
comprehensive list of specific CVDs and comorbidities. We present real-time service data
from three countries. There are several limitations. In the UK, our study population was 5%
of the overall population. We do not have country-level data outside the UK. Our analyses of
risk and excess deaths use retrospective EHR data. Our model assumes static infection rate
and RR and do not include changes over time. We used service data from limited hospitals
and only UK(ONS) administrative data was available. We do not report primary care or
community level data regarding CVD services. We modelled using limited comorbidities and
simple multimorbidity counts, and did not study impact of ethnicity. We assumed the same
effect across all specific CVDs.

Conclusion
There is a substantial avoidable burden of excess mortality in people with CVD during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Excess CVD deaths can be reduced in more integrated approaches,
focused on reducing COVID-19 infection rates, as well as managing CVD and comorbidities.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause excess deaths through direct due to infection) and
indirect effects. We searched PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Wellcome Open Research for peerreviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in
(COVID-19), using the search terms “coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “cardiovascular disease” and similar
terms, and “mortality”, up to May 31, 2020. We found no prior studies of excess deaths in those with
cardiovascular disease and the COVID-19 pandemic. Health services for myocardial infarction appear to
have decreased in some countries, but services for CVD have not been studied across specific CVDs,
countries or different phases of the pandemic. Such data will enable better prediction of the direct and
indirect effects of COVID-19 and planning for health system responses.

Added value of this study
Comparing hospital data from the UK, Italy and China, we show a profound disruption of CVD services
across referral, diagnosis and treatment which may contribute to excess deaths. Using a published model,
we estimated the excess COVID-19-related mortality in individuals with CVD by incorporating population
infection rate in different scenarios, differing degrees of impact of COVID-19 on health systems, and
prevalence of underlying conditions. As well as high rates of multimorbidity, we predict high excess
deaths in individuals with CVD, over a 1-year time horizon partly because indirect effects may be delayed.

Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings regarding excess deaths in prevalent and incident CVD, by direct and indirect effects, suggest
that access to acute and chronic CVD care should be prioritised during future pandemic waves, as well as
efforts and strategies to minimise infection rate in the population.
