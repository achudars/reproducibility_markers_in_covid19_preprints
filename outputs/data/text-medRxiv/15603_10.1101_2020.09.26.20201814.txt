COVID-19 cases have peaked and declined rapidly in many low- and middle-income countries in recent
months, in some cases after control measures were relaxed. For 10 such countries, the hypothesis that
COVID-19 cases have declined mainly through low susceptibility levels, stemming largely from high
levels of infection leading to (at least temporary) immunity, warrants serious consideration. The ReedFrost model, perhaps the simplest description for the evolution of cases in an epidemic, with only a few
constant parameters, fits the observed case data remarkably well, and yields parameter values that are
reasonable. The model results give infection levels of 45% and 79%, above the herd immunity threshold
for each country under their current social distancing conditions. Reproduction numbers range between
1.4 and 2.0, indicating that epidemic curves were “flattened” but not “suppressed”. Between 0.05% and
2.86% of cases have been detected according to the estimates – values which are consistent with
findings from serological studies. Overall infection fatality ratios for two of three countries studied are
lower than expected from reported infection fatality ratios by age (which are based on studies of several
high-income countries). COVID-19 may have lower age-specific fatality risks in some countries, due to
differences in immune-response, prior exposure to coronaviruses, disease characteristics or other
factors. We find that the hypothesis of control through low susceptibility would not have fit the evolution
of reported cases in several European countries, even just after the initial peaks; instead, these
countries reduced COVID-19 cases initially through disease control measures – and subsequent
resurgences of cases obviously prove that those countries have infection levels well below those
required for herd immunity. Our hypothesis that the 10 countries we studied have low susceptibility
levels should now be tested further through immunity studies, and efforts should continue to determine
the duration and extent of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 after infection.

Introduction
Figure 1, based on a similar one produced by researchers at Imperial College London [1], illustrates
how case numbers are expected to evolve during an epidemic under different conditions. The green
curve shows expected cases for an uncontrolled outbreak. This curve has three main features: initial
exponential growth in new cases, followed by a single peak as the cumulative cases reach a level at
which the remaining susceptible population is not large enough to sustain further growth, and an
exponential decline in new cases. The curve shape is characterised by two numbers. First, the basic
reproduction number, R0, the average number of new infections caused by each current infected
individual, at the outset of the disease outbreak when few people have been infected yet. Second, the
mean generation time, tg, the average time between infection of one person and when that person
infects other people. The peak of the curve is reached as the proportion of the population that remains
susceptible drops below 1/R0.
The red curve shows expected cases when governments and people take measures to control disease
spread. The red curve displays largely the same features as the green – disease spread is only halted
by high infection levels – but the curve is “flattened”, with cases spread out more over time and fewer
cases at the peak. In this case, disease control measures reduce the reproduction number to an
effective basic reproduction number, R0_e [2]. However, this number remains above 1, and the curve
peaks when the proportion of the population that is susceptible reduces to 1/R0_e. Note that the “effective
herd immunity threshold” (which is 1–1/R0_e) is not a fixed quantity: it depends on disease control
measures and will increase when control measures are lifted; and only when the “full” or “natural” herd
immunity threshold, 1–1/R0, is reached, through infection and/or vaccination, will the disease be
constrained even in the absence of control measures.
The blue curve shows the evolution of cases when disease control measures are sufficient to bring R0_e
below 1. The curve is “crushed” or “suppressed”; the initial exponential growth in case numbers is halted
and cases decline (almost always at a slower rate than for the green or red curves). In this case,
because most people are still susceptible to the disease, it is possible for the disease to return if
containment measures later allow R0_e to increase above 1, as shown in the dashed part of the blue
curve in Figure 1.

Patterns in reported cases
Reported cases in several low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have evolved in a manner that is
very similar to the red and green curves of Figure 1. We show the 7-day rolling average of reported new
cases for 10 such countries in Figure 2.

Other countries show similar patterns; we have chosen to study a subset with the clearest similarities
to expected outbreak curves like the red and green curves of Figure 1. In all these countries, the
reported cases have (1) grown exponentially, (2) reached a single clear peak and (3) declined
exponentially. Regulations were most stringent, and compliance was greatest, in most of these
countries, after the designation of the global pandemic in March and have relaxed to varying degrees
in recent months – but cases continued to decline. None of these countries has reported a significant
increase in new cases after the peak that would indicate a second wave (although cases in some
countries have only recently passed the peak). Together, these observations point to a hypothesis that
the outbreaks in these countries have reached sufficiently low levels of remaining susceptibility, and
that the recently observed declines in new cases are because many people are not susceptible– at
least temporarily.
However, the numbers of cases in other countries – including most high-income countries (HICs) but
also some LMICs – show patterns that are much different. Figure 3 shows 7-day rolling averages of
reported cases for 6 such comparison countries. In these countries, cases have evolved in a manner
that is similar to the first part of the blue curve of Figure 1. There have been peaks in numbers of
reported cases, yet the decline is often longer and slower than the red or green curves would suggest.
In some countries, there have been resurgences in cases, indicating that the initial suppression was
not due to low levels of susceptibility.

Fit with disease outbreak model and estimation of outbreak parameters
We test our hypothesis that the disease dynamics in these 10 countries has been driven primarily by
susceptibility levels, by using a simple disease outbreak model and fitting to the reported cases. The
outbreak model is a linearised Reed-Frost model [3], the textbook deterministic mathematical model for
an epidemic. The curves produced by this model depend on just two parameters, namely the effective
basic reproduction number (R0_e) and the mean generation time (tg). Expected reported cases are
calculated by scaling the Reed-Frost model’s results by a detection rate (p) [4]. The parameters that
produce the best-fit curve for reported cases in each country are determined partly analytically from the
observed data and partly from least squares regression. Our model parameters (R0_e, tg and p) are
constant over time – a beneficial assumption in that it avoids having too many free parameters, which
might lead to good fits even if the model incorrectly describes the disease dynamics. Furthermore, in
most of the countries studied, reported cases and reported deaths have followed similar trends (with
changes in deaths lagging the corresponding changes in cases), even for countries with very low
absolute numbers of reported cases and deaths – which suggests that the shapes of the curves likely
reflect trends in actual cases and deaths, and that detection rates for both do not vary wildly over time
[5].
The best-fit curves are shown with red squares in Figure 2, for each of the 10 LMICs studied, and the
corresponding parameters are presented in Table 1. For South Africa, R0_e and tg are calculated from
the slopes and width of the observed data, and p is calculated from the sum of reported cases up to the
peak divided by the total population times the expected proportion of population infected at the peak.
For the other 9 countries, we use the value of tg calculated for South Africa, and determine R0_e and p
from fitting to the observed case data. The fits are close, with R-squared goodness-of-fit measures
between 0.94 and 1.00. (The fits are somewhat less good for Central African Republic and Malawi, due
to very low numbers of reported cases, and for Pakistan, due to undulations in reported cases which
may signal variations in R0_e or p which the model assumes are constant.) These results demonstrate
that the observed case patterns can indeed very accurately be described by an exponential outbreak
halted by declining numbers of people still susceptible to infection.
Table 1 presents best estimates for R0_e, p and the infection level (on 7 September), together with
ranges of possible values (in parentheses). There are fairly wide ranges of reasonably possible values
because the effects of R0_e and tg on the observed case curves are hard to distinguish – especially
when the observed data has more “noise” or when the observed data does not include many points
after the peak, and when values of R0_e are close to 1 [6]. For South Africa, R0_e has a best-estimate
value of 1.74 (and a range of possible values between 1.45 and 1.90); the corresponding value of tg is
7.8 days (4.8 days – 9.1 days) and of p is 1.41% (1.93% – 1.27%). For the other 9 countries, we
determine best estimates of R0_e and p by assuming that tg = 7.8 days and fitting model outputs to data
on reported cases. The value of tg = 7.8 days is consistent with studies of serial intervals – the time
between illness onset in successive cases in a transmission chain, whose mean value should equal the
mean generation time tg – by Ali et al. and others [7], and close to the values used in other COVID-19
models [8]. We also conduct sensitivity analyses, determining ranges of possible values of R0_e and p
if tg varies between 3 days and 11 days (wider than the range of possible values suggested in the
literature [7,8]), and finding the values of R0_e and p that produce the best fits to the reported cases for
the extreme values of tg. For all of the possible values of tg, and corresponding values of R0_e and p, the
reported case curves generated do not change much, for each of the countries, and lead to the same
implication that total infection levels in the countries have grown to the point where new cases are
declining due to insufficient numbers of susceptible people (for the current value of R0_e, i.e., under
current disease control conditions).
The effective basic reproduction numbers, R0_e, in Table 1 range between 1.4 (in Bolivia) and 2.0 (in
Madagascar). Estimates for the basic reproduction number, R0, the “natural” value in the absence of
social distancing, for SAR-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in Wuhan at the outset of the global
epidemic, range from 1.4 [9] up to 5.7 [10]. R0 might be expected to be higher in low-income countries

due to factors such as dense living conditions, lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities,
and inability of most people to work from home. Thus, our findings suggest that, for the 10 LMICs
studied, social distancing measures and practices, perhaps in combination with higher levels of partial
immunity from prior exposure to coronaviruses [11,12], likely reduced the effective basic reproduction
number and slowed the spread of the disease – but with R0_e above 1, they did not “crush the curve”.
Detection rates are estimated to be very low, ranging from 2.86% in Colombia to 0.05% in Malawi.
These low detection rates explain how high levels of actual infections could be reached despite low
numbers of reported cases, relative to total population, in all the countries studied. These low detection
rates are not surprising. Serological testing results in Kenya, Pakistan and South Africa suggest that
the number of people with coronavirus antibodies substantially exceeds the reported cases – by factors
of up to 3,800 in Kenya (based on data in mid-May) [13], of up to 540 in Pakistan (based on data from
May to July) [14] and of up to 65 in South Africa (based on data from July to early August) [15], which
would correspond to detection rates of 0.03% for Kenya, 0.18% for Pakistan and 1.5% for South Africa.
Furthermore, there is evidence that serological tests might underestimate effective immunity levels,

because people may have partial immunity due to T-cell responses even if infection by SARS-CoV-2
did not produce antibodies or if those antibodies subsequently waned [11,12].
In all these countries, the analysis indicates that significant percentages of their populations have been
infected and have become immune – at least temporarily. The best estimates of total infection levels
on 7 September derived from the fitted curves range from 45% in Bolivia to 79% in Madagascar [16].
Note that the infection levels required to curb the outbreak (the herd immunity threshold) normally quote
the percentage of population infected at the peak of the curve, but significant numbers of people
continue to be infected after this point, even as the numbers of new cases decline.
The infection fatality ratio (IFR), or the percentage of deaths from COVID-19 among those infected with
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can be estimated for countries with reliable estimates of deaths. For Bolivia,
Colombia and South Africa [17], the IFRs calculated from reported deaths divided by the total number
of infections derived from our analysis, are 0.15%, 0.10% and 0.04%, respectively. In these three
countries, estimates have been made of excess deaths due to natural causes, and, if all of these excess
deaths are due to COVID-19, the IFRs for the three countries could be up to 0.57%, 0.13% and 0.11%,
respectively [18]. All three countries are expected to have a lower overall IFR, compared to European
countries, because their populations have a higher share of young people, who are significantly less
likely to die from COVID-19 if they contract the virus. Differences in population age profiles explain the
estimated IFR for Bolivia, but not for Colombia or South Africa. If reported infection fatality ratios by
age, based on data from several HICs [19], were valid for these countries, the expected overall IFRs
for Bolivia, Colombia and South Africa would be 0.57%, 0.63% and 0.33%, respectively. Possible
explanations for why mortality risk for COVID-19 might be lower in Colombia or South Africa, compared
to the (mainly) European countries from which IFRs by age are derived, could include differences in
immune-system response (already observed, for example, between men and women in some HICs),
partial immunity to COVID-19 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses, differences in lethality and
prevalence of different virus strains, and different infection levels for different age groups.
To test the robustness of our approach, we applied the same methodology to fit curves to the first peaks
in the comparison countries shown in Figure 3 (represented as red squares in this figure). Researchers
at Imperial College London and others argued convincingly in June that European countries have not
reached herd immunity [20], and subsequent increases in cases have proven their point. Applying our
model to fit curves just to the first peaks (shown with blue circles in Figure 3) [21], and hence assuming
that the peaks were due to herd immunity, we find that the best-fit curves match the observed data for
the first peaks fairly well in all cases, but with values for the disease parameters that are implausible.
For example, for France, the best-fitting curve yields R0_e = 1.4, tg = 3 days (the lowest permitted value)
and p = 0.39%. The detection rate is well below the detection rates of between 7% and 18% suggested
by serological studies in European countries [22]. New Zealand is well-known for “crushing” the curve
– and the parameters associated with the best-fit “herd immunity curve” to its reported cases would be
R0_e = 1.9, tg = 3 days and a highly improbable p = 0.03%. Thus, our approach leads to a conclusion for
the comparison countries that the evolution of reported cases was not due to herd immunity (but instead
must have been due to control measures). With this check, we increase our confidence in the
hypothesis that the outbreaks in the 10 LMICs studied are declining due to herd immunity, which
generates well-fitting curves with plausible parameters.

Discussion
Prominent models of the epidemic from teams at Imperial College London (ICL) [23] and the University

the 10 LMICs we studied are much greater than reported, but much smaller than our analysis suggests.
For example, the models estimated total infection levels for South Africa of 7.7% (ICL) and 9.5% (IHME),
and corresponding case detection rates of 13.9% and 11.2%, as of early September [25] – implying
infection levels significantly below the levels of up to 40% suggested by serological study findings in
Cape Town from July to early August [15]. It has previously been observed, by the IHME COVID-19
Model Comparison Team, that the predictive performance of seven COVID-19 models, including those
of ICL and IHME, shows significantly higher errors for Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin
America and the Caribbean, compared to their performance for HICs [26]. Our research suggests why
this might be the case. The ICL, IHME and other models are well-suited to HICs: reported deaths for
such countries are likely to be reasonably close to actual deaths; the IFRs used in the models are based
mainly on studies conducted in HICs; and it is clear from the evolution of reported cases that these
countries have not reached herd immunity [20] and that their effective basic reproduction numbers have
varied significantly over time as disease control measures have been introduced and adjusted
(necessitating the additional granularity of SEIR modelling). However, for some LMICs: reported deaths
from COVID-19 are likely to understate actual deaths by large factors [18,26]; age-specific IFRs might
differ substantially from those in Europe and North America; and a simple model, using the
approximation that effective basic reproduction numbers and detection rates remain constant over time,
may be sufficient to describe the evolution of reported cases well (at least for the 10 countries we
studied).
Systematic studies of representative population samples should be conducted in the 10 LMICs
discussed here (and perhaps other countries as well) to determine the percentages of people who have
been infected and are immune – and consequently test directly the primary conclusion that the overall
infection levels are high and likely exceed effective herd immunity thresholds.
Even when susceptibility levels are sufficiently low that the virus can no longer spread exponentially, it
will not be gone completely. Individuals may still contract the virus if they are not immune. Isolated
communities, such as rural areas far from urban centres, may have much lower infection levels than
the overall population, and may still experience localised outbreaks. New general outbreaks might
happen as control measures are relaxed, and such outbreaks could be large for countries where R0_e
is currently close to 1 and/or for which cases have not mostly declined from the current peak – because
relaxing disease control measures will increase R0_e and could shift the effective herd immunity
threshold to new values that are substantially greater than the current share of the population with
immunity.
It is not yet known how long immunity from SARS-CoV-2 lasts. Even if a population is protected due to
a high immunity level today, it is possible that this could be lost over time, which might lead to future
outbreaks – the severity of which would depend on the share of people losing immunity, the amount of
variation in timing of when people lose immunity, and whether susceptibility to reinfection is equal to
the susceptibility to first infection. New strains of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged, and it is conceivable that
future mutations could allow the virus to evade immune systems, and thus render previously immune
populations susceptible again to the disease – but there is no evidence yet of any such immunityevading strains.

We introduce the effective basic reproduction number, R0_e in this paper, because it is important
to distinguish between changes in the reproduction number brought about by disease control
measures and changes caused by increases in immunity levels in the population. The literature
usually presents the effective reproduction number, Re, defined as the actual average number of
new infections caused by each current infected individual at any given time. Re thus is affected
by both disease control measures and immunity levels.

Rothman KJ. Epidemiology. Oxford University Press; 2012. See Chapter 6 of this book or other
textbooks on epidemiology. Our linearized version of the Reed-Frost model uses the formula ni+1
= ni * R0_e * si / ntot, where ni is the number of infected people for the time period i, si is the
number of susceptible people without immunity for the time period i, and ntot is the total
population. The mean generation time tg is the duration of each time period in the model.
Expected reported cases are equal to p * ni for each time step i in the model, where p is the case
detection rate.

One more parameter is required in fitting the curve, namely the difference between the actual
first case and the first reported case. This parameter can only shift the model curve to earlier or
later times, without changing the shape of the curve and without impacting any of the other
parameters.

5.

In practice, one might expect R0_e, tg and p to vary due to introduction or relaxation of disease
control measures, seasonal changes in behaviours, changes in testing protocols, and so on.
However, such variations for the 10 selected countries appear not to be so great that they cause
the output of the simple linearised Reed-Frost model to deviate from the observed case data.
The evolution of reported cases and deaths in other LMICs, besides the 10 countries studied
here, show features that are suggestive of dynamics determined mainly or partly by levels of
infection and susceptibility over time – but the reported cases (as of 7 September) for many of
these other LMICs did not always display simple, smooth, single peak curves, perhaps because
the deviations from the key assumptions of the simple Reed-Frost model, including constancy of
R0_e, tg and p over time, immunity being sustained for a substantial period of time after infection,
and homogeneity in disease spread across the population, are sufficiently large to cause the real
behaviour of the disease to deviate from the model outputs. It is in theory possible that variations
in reproduction numbers, generation times and case detection rates – over time and across a
population – could produce reported case curves that match those from the linearised ReedFrost model, even though the actual cases were evolving in a different and more complex
manner. However, such behaviour would require very specific changes in R0_e, tg and p, which
seem unlikely to take place in practice: for example, the reductions in reported cases in South
Africa from mid-July to early-September might be explained by a continuous reduction in case
detection rate of more than a factor of 1,000 during that time, but this seems unlikely given that
the total number of daily tests decreased by only a factor of about 3 over the same period.

6.

For a given shape of the curve of disease cases over time – characterised by the exponential
rates of increase before the peak and of decrease after the peak and the width of the curve –
there is a unique combination of R0_e and tg which leads to the observed curve. However, for any
given curve, there are a range of combinations of R0_e and tg which can produce very similar
curves. (This issue is why it is very hard to determine the basic reproduction number, R0, for any
new disease, even when the case doubling time is well-known.) In the case of South Africa, the
observed data is sufficiently “clean” that we are able to calculate R0_e and tg. For the other
countries, the observed data is more “noisy” or does not have much data after the peak, and

data.

COVID-19. (Preprint) https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095075. Ali et al. find, from data on
transmission pairs in mainland China in January and February 2020, that the mean serial interval
was 7.8 days early in the epidemic but shortened substantially to 2.6 days within a month. Griffin
et al. found 22 estimates for the mean serial intervals between 3.1 and 7.5 days, and 3 estimates
of the mean generation time between 3.9 and 5.2 days. Studies of serial intervals and mean
generation time rely on symptomatic cases identified within health systems, and Ali et al. find that
early case isolation decreases the mean serial interval. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume
that the mean generation time, equal to the mean serial interval, for complete populations should
be greater than those reported in the literature. The best estimate for tg calculated from the
reported cases curve in South Africa, namely 7.8 days, is the same value as the mean serial
interval in the early days of the epidemic in China reported by Ali et al., and is a reasonable value
to use for in our model for the other 9 LMICs that we consider. For the sensitivity analysis, we
use a range of tg from 3 to 11 days, which is wider than the full range of possible values of the
mean generation time suggested in the literature to date.

16. All numbers apply to the portion of a country that has had some level of exposure. If specific
physically concentrated groups in a country are fully shielded, the total proportion of the national
population that has been infected to date, would be lower than the numbers listed here. For most
countries, the numbers are as of 7 September; for some, they are as of 5 or 6 September.
17. The other countries studied have not reported excess mortality, and are likely to under-report
deaths from COVID-19 significantly, and by differing proportions in each country. As a result, we
limit our estimates of IFRs to the cases of Bolivia, Colombia and South Africa.
18. For all three countries, we use reported deaths as of 21 September. We estimate the IFRs
expected if all excess deaths from natural causes are due to COVID-19, from the ratios of excess
deaths to reported deaths as of the dates for which estimates of excess deaths are available. For
Bolivia, as of 31 August, reported deaths due to COVID-19 were 5,027 and underreported deaths
attributed to COVID-19 were 14,508, according to the Servicio de Registro Cívico (SERECI) (as
reported in https://muywaso.com/14-mil-muertes-que-no-se-pueden-ocultar-y-una-tasa-desubregistro-del-75/). For Colombia, from 18 May to 2 August, reported deaths due to COVID-19
were 12,393 and total excess deaths were 15,728, as reported by Minsalud
(https://www.minsalud.gov.co/sites/rid/Lists/BibliotecaDigital/RIDE/VS/ED/VSP/estimacionexceso-mortalidad-colombia-covid19.pdf). For South Africa, reported deaths due to COVID-19
were 15,499 as of 15 September, while excess deaths due to natural causes (which may not all
be due to COVID-19 but are assumed to be for this calculation) between 6 May and 15
September are estimated to be 44,481 by the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC)
