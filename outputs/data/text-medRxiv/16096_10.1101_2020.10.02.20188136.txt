Over the last months, cases of SARS-CoV-2 surged repeatedly in many countries and could often be controlled with non-pharmaceutical interventions such
as social distancing. We analyzed de-identified GPS tracking data from 1.15 to
1.4 million cell phones in Germany per day between March-November 2020 to
identify encounters between individuals and statistically evaluate large-scale
contact behavior. Using graph sampling theory we estimated the contact index (CI), a metric for number and heterogeneity of contacts and found that
the contact index, and not the total number of contacts, is an accurate predictor for the effective reproduction number R. A high correlation between
CI and R occurring more than two weeks later allows timely assessment of the
social behavior well before the infections become detectable. The CI quantifies the role of superspreading and allows assigning risks to specific contact
behavior. We provide a critical CI-value beyond which R is expected to rise
above 1 and propose to use it to leverage the social distancing interventions
for the coming months.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused a sustained pandemic
with more than 60 million confirmed cases and more than 1.4 million deaths as of November 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious with an estimated basic reproductive number
R0 between 1.5-4 [1, 2, 3, 4]. It may spread invisibly in the community until a local outbreak becomes noticeable by a larger number of severe clinical cases. In the absence of a

vaccine, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been considered an important tool
to contain the spread of the virus. In Germany, before the implementation of strict interventions, an exponential growth of case numbers led to an effective reproduction number
R of about 3. Beginning March 13, 2020, public events with more more than 50 visitors
were banned, followed by a nationwide lockdown with a general ban on public contacts on
March 23, 2020. From mid-March there was a steady decline of R, followed by a plateau
of R around 1 and an average number of less than 1,000 new cases daily from May to the
end of September. Suﬀiciently low levels of daily new infections allowed for the release
of interventions. However, as SARS-CoV-2 could not be completely eradicated from the
population, a second wave began in October, and new restrictions were introduced with
interpersonal distance and rapid detection of local outbreaks remaining key.
Due to asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6, 7], a large portion of infected
individuals remains undetected. Furthermore, it is estimated that 44% of secondary
cases are infected through pre-symptomatic transmission events [8]. With an estimated
incubation time of 5 days [3],a reported time of 6 days between symptoms and diagnosis
based on laboratory tests [9], laboratory testing does not appear to be ideal for rapid
outbreak detection given the short infection doubling time of SARS-Cov-2 of 1.4 to 2.5
days [10]. Thus, other methods are needed which allow for the early detection of outbreaks
and forecast of the outbreaks’ intensity. Soon after the beginning of the pandemic, several
cell phone apps have been developed to monitor the health of the population or record
contacts between users based on device-mounted Bluetooth. While the technology is
promising, the results in several countries, including Germany, have not met expectations
[11].
In this study, we analyze position-derived encounters or “contacts” of cell phones.
We hypothesize that individual location history data enabled by the GPS information of
mobile phones can capture contact behavior of the population statistically and in this way
allows for conclusions on the epidemic spread even if information on the infection states
is not included. For our analysis we assume that each cell phone is used always by the
same individual. For each cell phone in our representative and anonymous panel of more
than one million devices we obtain records that contain up to several hundreds messages
per day and device. We then project the positions for each message to a predefined tile
of about 8m × 8m. Using an identification number of the tile we then scan for coincident
presence of two different individuals on the same tile with the same time stamp rounded
to two minutes, see Fig. 1A and Supplementary Material. For simplicity, we define as
one contact a pair of individuals that encountered one or more times during one day. The
collected data covers about 1 % of the German population and the entire period of the
pandemic, including weeks before its beginning.
For a detailed analysis of the data we use methods from complex network science. We
consider a graph of contacts for each day by assigning each device to a node of the network
while each contact defines an edge between the respective nodes Fig. 1B. We then focus on
the graph parameters that determine the simplest measures for epidemic modeling: the

mean degree and the heterogeneity of the degree distribution. For a statistical estimation
of the moments of the degree distribution for the underlying “real” Germany-wide network
we use graph sampling theory described in the Supplementary Material.
In Fig. 2 we compare the evolution of the effective reproduction number (panel A)
estimated from the Nowcast case numbers for Germany (seven-day-R value from [13])
with the evolution of the graph parameters. Fig. 2B shows that the mean number of
contacts of individuals per day was visibly reduced in the mid of March. This holds
particularly in the initial phase of the outbreak after which the weekly average number of
contacts per person drops from around 20 to less than 7 (March 27). However, beginning
in mid of April the number of contacts increases again and reaches a relatively stable
plateau of about 75 % of the pre-outbreak level for the rest of the time. Interestingly, the
contact number increases with the beginning of mask use suggesting that the perceived
additional safety of the masks leads to a relaxation of personal distance.
The two curves, for R and the mean contact number, roughly correspond. However,
we note that the R value decreases synchronously with the mean degree until both hit
minimal levels, which is not intuitive since the contacts should precede the infection for
a few days. As well, there is the substantial increase of the number of contacts after
April which is not accompanied by an equally strong increase in R. While the number

of contacts recovers 75% of its maximal value, R stays at values around 1.0 for much of
the summer months. We thus conclude that the number of contacts does not suﬀiciently
reflect and anticipate the subsequent evolution of R. For this, a more complex metric is
needed.
It is known that for heterogeneous networks the reproduction number R on graphs
generally follows the ratio of second to first moment of the degree distribution but not the
first moment (or mean contact number) [14]. The degree distribution can be very broad in
the case of social networks and the ratio gives a very different number than the mean (the
numbers are equal if the contacts are homogeneous). Particularly we find this to be the
case in our contact graph indicating a strong role of heterogeneity in the contact behavior.
In the following, to distinguish the incidence-based R from the contact-based number, we

introduce the “Contact Index” (CI) for the statistical estimate of its population value and
compare it to R derived from the incidence numbers.
In Fig. 2C the curves show the evolution of the contact index (blue) and its sevenday moving average (red). After the first lockdown, the contact index stays relatively
constant and remains low even after relaxation of lockdown and during the summer. This
suggests that it reflects and anticipates better the evolution of R then the mean number
of contacts. The inset shows the detailed evolution of the CI before the first lockdown and
gives an idea how the “normal” social behavior of the population is reflected in the CI.
First, a strongly increased CI, up to 1000 and more, is seen during weekends, particularly
on Fridays and Saturdays. On other days of the week the CI is at a few hundreds. There
are notable exceptions during the working days such as March 3, a Tuesday. On this day
we identified a soccer game of the German cup to be largely responsible for the increase.
The evolution of the Contact Index during the first wave and its relation to the reproduction number can be further inspected in Fig. 3A. Indeed, we can see that strong
decreases followed a number of political interventions: cancellation of soccer games (three
games in the first division on March 8, one final game on March 9) and other large public
gatherings, limiting of public concerts etc. to a maximum of 50 persons (March 13), closing of school (March 16), social distancing measures (“lockdown”, March 23). It should,
however, be kept in mind that companies shifted to home-oﬀice during this time. The
specific effect of the various measures is thus hard to distinguish from self-imposed social
distancing. Finally, we notice that the CI reflects the return of R towards 1 much better
then the total number of contacts. The CI anticipates the R decrease by about one week
during the first wave, while, as described above, the contact number falls concurrently
with R.
The Contact Index also shows a strong association with the outbreak’s evolution in the
phase after the first wave and during the second wave. Fig. 3B shows a zoom of the time
evolution after the first wave, exhibiting a concurrent evolution of R and CI. Generally,
the CI anticipates the infection numbers. This holds particularly for the onset and decay
of the second surge in October, which is anticipated by a strong increase and decay of
the CI. A notable omission from this co-evolution is the large but short effect of a local
outbreak in June (with 1,413 infections [15]) as well as an increase of R for a few weeks
in July and August. We assume that a part of these infections was due to travellers that
returned from vacation in other countries with higher incidence rates. We can therefore
not expect that a similar behavior is seen in the CI that only reflects connectivity within
the country.
The correlation of CI and R can be assessed quantitatively from Fig. 3C which plots
the R values versus the contact index at 17 days earlier showing the predictive power of
the CI. The Pearson correlation coeﬀicient is maximized for a delay of 17 days between
the CI and R with a coeﬀicient of 0.82 (see inset, 95 % confidence interval 0.78-0.86). A
much smaller coeﬀicient is obtained for the correlation of R and the mean contact number
(red curve in the inset).

A linear regression of R and CI for a delay of 17 days was applied for two phases: one
before the mandatory use of masks (blue diagonal line in 3B) and after masks were used
widespread (red line). We did not find a substantial difference in the linear approximation.
Thus, in contrast to studies that find a protective effect of mask wearing ([16] but also see
[17]), our data does not provide significant evidence for an effect of masks in limiting of
infection behavior. The linear regression model predicts that a contact index of CIcrit ≈
38 (95 % confidence interval 19-57) or more would drive the infection behavior into a
sustained super-critical regime with R > 1. This observation can be useful for the tuning
of social distancing measures and the timely assessment of the measures.
It is instructive to analyze the causes for the large CI before the lockdown and the
reduction of the CI after a lockdown. We found that indeed a very broad distributions of
contact numbers for individuals is responsible for the large CI values before the lockdown.
After each surge, this distribution becomes much more narrow leading to a smaller CI.
This demonstrates the central role of superspreading (called hubs in graph theory) in the
contact network (see Supplementary Materials and Methods for more details).
How plausible is the time delay of 17 days between the effective R and the contact
index? Since we have used the R value based on seven day intervals and a four day
average of the case numbers we expect a delay of 7+2 days between the actual onset of
symptoms and report in the table we have used [18]. Thus the delay of 17 days is close
to the expected one if one adds four to seven days of incubation time [3]. The remaining
mismatch could result from inaccuracies in the imputation of data where the onset of
symptoms is not known or where no symptoms were reported [18].
It should be noted that the degree distribution is only one graph-based factor that
enters the epidemic threshold. A real network could also have, for example, clustering
and degree correlations that may change the R value [14]. This may also explain why the
CI-R-relation in our computations does not go through the origin and varies over a much
wider relative range than the seven-day R value for the first wave in Germany. Further
work is needed to clarify the impact of these graph properties.
In summary, we showed a strong association between the effective R and the GPS
assessed contact behavior of the German population. We found a high correlation of R
with the contact index CI, which accounts for a heterogeneous contact behavior of the
population and superspreading behavior. The CI allows to quantitatively evaluate risks
for certain behavior for instance by regional analysis (see Fig. 2 in the Supplementary
Material). Hence, we propose to use the Contact Index as a tool for an early warning
system, to assess the effectiveness of social distancing policies and for decision support
of social distancing policy-making. Overall, GPS data and various metrics derived from
it can provide a means to assess the effect of lockdown measures on contacts and their
association with reductions in infection rates.
