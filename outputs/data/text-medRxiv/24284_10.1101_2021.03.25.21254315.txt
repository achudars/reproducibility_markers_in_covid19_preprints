Summary (275 words)

Background
As large-scale immunization programs against COVID-19 proceed around the world, safety
signals will emerge that need rapid evaluation. We report population-based, age- and sexspecific background incidence rates of potential adverse events of special interest (AESI) in
eight countries using thirteen databases.
Methods
This multi-national network cohort study included eight electronic medical record and five
administrative claims databases from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain,
the United Kingdom, and the United States, mapped to a common data model. People
observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 were included. We based
study outcomes on lists published by regulators: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis,
appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation,
encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke,
immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, and
transverse myelitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and database. We
pooled rates across databases using random effects meta-analyses. We classified metaanalytic estimates into Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences categories:
very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare.
Findings
We analysed 126,661,070 people. Rates varied greatly between databases and by age and sex.
Some AESI (e.g., myocardial infarction, Guillain-Barre syndrome) increased with age, while
others (e.g., anaphylaxis, appendicitis) were more common in young people. As a result, AESI
were classified differently according to age. For example, myocardial infarction was very rare
in children, rare in women aged 35-54 years, uncommon in men and women aged 55-84 years,
and common in those aged ≥85 years.
Interpretation
We report robust baseline rates of prioritised AESI across 13 databases. Age, sex, and variation
between databases should be considered if background AESI rates are compared to event
rates observed with COVID-19 vaccines.

MAIN TEXT (2947 words)

Introduction
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19,
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a global pandemic. As of March 2021, over 100 million
confirmed cases and 2·7 million deaths have been reported worldwide.1 Vaccines for COVID19 have been developed at unprecedented speed, with phase 3 clinical efficacy trials reporting
resulted for some vaccines less than a year after the WHO declared the pandemic. Several
vaccines have been authorised by regulators since December 2020, such as the European
Medicines Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, and the UK
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Large-scale immunization
programs are ongoing worldwide.
While this scientific achievement should be celebrated, we must recognize that emergency
use is accompanied by residual uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in
all populations of interest. As with all medical products reaching the milestone of regulatory
authorization, vaccine safety must continue to be monitored to complement what was initially
learned during clinical development. Spontaneous adverse event reporting has served as a
foundational component of post-approval pharmacovigilance activities to ensure the safe and
appropriate use of medical products. Observational healthcare data captured during the
routine course of clinical care, such as electronic health records and administrative claims, can
augment pharmacovigilance by providing real-world context about potential adverse events
and their rates in populations of interest. Background rates of adverse events have historically
played an important role in monitoring the safety of vaccines by serving as a baseline
comparator for observed rates among those vaccinated.2,3 Each new vaccine has potential
adverse events of special interest (AESI) that warrant focused evaluation, based on historical
precedent set by prior vaccines and knowledge acquired during its development.
As COVID-19 vaccines have received authorization for emergency use, regulatory agencies
around the world have been preparing safety surveillance strategies. The US FDA Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research published a protocol on “Background Rates of Adverse
Events of Special Interest for COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring.”4 The European Medicines
Agency-funded vACCine covid-19 monitoring readinESS (ACCESS) project also included
estimation of background AESI rates in their protocol.5 Recognizing the global burden that
COVID-19 represents and following the WHO Council for International Organizations of
Medical Sciences (CIOMS) guidance that the most valid data for comparison in a particular
area are the background rates from the local population,6 the Observational Health Data
Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community collaborated to design and execute an
international open science study to characterize background rates of COVID-19 AESI. In this
paper, we provide descriptive epidemiology context for COVID-19 AESIs using observational
data from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US.

Methods
Study design
A multinational, multi-database population-based network cohort study.
Data sources
We included thirteen databases from eight countries, of which eight were electronic health
record data sources and five were administrative claims data sources.

The electronic health record databases were: 1. IQVIA Australia Electronic Medical Records
(IQVIA_AUSTRALIA); 2. Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI_NETHERLANDS), a primary
care records database from the Netherlands; 3. IQVIA Longitudinal Patient Data France
(IQVIA_FRANCE); 4. IQVIA Disease Analyser Germany (IQVIA_GERMANY); 5. Information
System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP_H_SPAIN), a primary care records database that
covers over 80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain; 6. Clinical Practice Research Datalink,
which consists of data collected from UK primary care for all ages (CPRD_GOLD_UK); 7.
Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC_US), which covers the New YorkPresbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center in the US; and 8. Optum® deidentified Electronic Health Record Dataset (OPTUM_EHR_US), which covers more than 103
million patients and over 7,000 hospitals and clinics across the US.
The claims-based databases were the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC_JAPAN) and four US
administrative claims databases: IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters
Database (CCAE_US), IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits
Database (MDCR_US), IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD_US),
Optum® De-Identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database – Socio-Economic Status
(OPTUM_SES_US).
A detailed description of the databases can be found in Appendix Table 1.
All datasets were previously mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
common data model, which is maintained by the Observational Health Data Sciences and
Informatics (OHDSI) network. The analysis code could therefore be distributed across all
contributing centers without sharing patient-level data.7,8
Population/study participants
In our primary analysis, we defined the target at-risk population as people who were observed
on 1 January 2017, 1 January 2018, or 1 January 2019 and were observed for at least 365 days
before this observation date. We defined 1 January each year as the index date.
Events of interest
The events of interest in this study were the AESIs that might need evaluation following
COVID-19 vaccination. This outcome list was developed primarily based on the “Background
Rates of Adverse Events of Special Interest for COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring” protocol
published by the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the prioritiszd COVID-19
vaccine AESI list by the Brighton Collaboration, and other previous studies.4,9 Fifteen events
were included: non-hemorrhagic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, acute myocardial infarction,
deep
vein
thrombosis,
pulmonary
embolism,
anaphylaxis,
Bell’s
palsy,
myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, appendicitis, immune thrombocytopenia, disseminated
intravascular
coagulation,
encephalomyelitis
(including
acute
disseminated
encephalomyelitis), Guillain-Barre syndrome, and transverse myelitis.4
Events were identified by condition occurrence records (e.g., diagnosis codes from claims or
diagnosis codes and problem lists from electronic health records). Encephalomyelitis, nonhemorrhagic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction definitions also
required the record to occur within an inpatient setting (any position), while the Guillain-Barre
syndrome definition required the condition to be recorded in an inpatient setting in the
primary position.
Qualifying events could not be previously observed in a ‘clean window’ period before the
index date. In keeping with the FDA protocol, we applied a clean window of 365 days for all
events except anaphylaxis (30 days) and facial nerve palsy and encephalomyelitis (183 days).4
The full specifications of all phenotype definitions, including source codes and standard

concepts, are available in Appendix Tables 2 and 3.
As the CPRD-GOLD (UK), IQVIA (France, Germany, and Australia), and IPCI (the Netherlands)
databases only included primary care data, we did not use them for events whose definition
required an inpatient diagnosis.
Analysis
We defined the time-at-risk as a 365-day period following the index date. People contributed
time-at-risk from 1 January to 31 December for each qualifying year in 2017 to 2019, but time
was censored during the clean window following an event and at the end of a person's
observation period. One person could contribute more than one event, with outcome-specific
pre-specified clean periods of 30 to 365 days used to avoid duplicate counts.
Incidence rates were estimated as the total number of events divided by the person-time at
risk per 100,000 person-years. We calculated the age-by-sex specific incidence rates in each
database and report all rates where the event counts exceeded a minimum cell count of 5.
Age was calculated as year of index date minus year of birth and was partitioned into eight
mutually exclusive age groups: 1-5 years old, 6-17, 18-35, 36-55, 56-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85
years and older. We then pooled age-sex specific rates of each AESI across all databases using
random-effects models with the DerSimonian-Laird method to estimate between-database
variance.10 We estimated 95% predicted intervals (95% confidence intervals) using the R
package ‘meta’.11
Meta-analytic age and sex-specific rates were classified using the World Health Organization
Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) thresholds: very common
(≥1/10), common (<1/10 to ≥1/100), uncommon (<1/100 to ≥1/1,000), rare (<1/1,000 to
≥1/10,000), and very rare (<1/10,000).12
All statistical analyses were performed in R software.13 The study protocol and analysis code

Ethical approval
The protocol for this research was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory
Committee (ISAC) for MHRA Database Research (protocol number 20_000211), the IDIAPJGol
Clinical Research Ethics Committee (project code: 21/007-PCV), the IPCI governance board

(AAAO7805).

Results
From 13 databases, 126,661,070 people contributed 227,043,370 person-years of follow-up.
Each database captured important different population demographics, as shown in Table 1,
and collectively represented all age and sex subgroups from eight countries.
Table 2 summarises the incidence rates of the 15 AESIs, stratified by age and sex, based on
prediction intervals from a meta-analysis of the database estimates. Each age/sex subgroup
was also classified using the CIOMS adverse event frequency system (very common, common,
uncommon, rare, or very rare). The incidence of several outcomes varied substantially by age.
For example, acute myocardial infarction was very rare (<1/10,000) in women under 35 years,
rare (1/1,000 to 1/10,000) in women aged 35 to 54 years, uncommon (1/100 to 1/1,000) in
both men and women aged 55 to 84 years, and common (1/10 to 1/100) in men and women
aged 85 years and older. For both men and women, deep vein thrombosis was rare in those

under 18 years, uncommon in those aged 35 to 84 years, and common in those 85 years and
older. Women aged 18 to 34 years had a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis than men of the
same age.
The AESIs studied spanned the continuum of possible frequencies. Non-hemorrhagic stroke,
acute myocardial infarction, and deep vein thrombosis were all common in those aged 85
years and older and uncommon in those aged 55 to 74 years. Anaphylaxis, Bell’s palsy,
appendicitis, and immune thrombocytopenia were largely rare in all age groups, although
appendicitis was uncommon in those aged 6 to 34 years. Guillain-Barre syndrome and
transverse myelitis were very rare in nearly all subgroups.
The prediction intervals for each age-sex subgroup were notably wide, reflecting the
substantial population-level heterogeneity observed across sources. Figure 1 shows the
database-specific incidence rates that were used to calculate the meta-analytic estimates. The
rates recorded for deep vein thrombosis highlight this variation. For women aged 35 to 54
years, the incidence rates ranged from 159/100,000 person-years in Spain (SIDIAP) to
866/100,000 person-years in the US (MDCD). We obtained 13 database estimates for the
incidence in women aged 65 to 74 years, ranging from 387/100,000 to 1,443/100,000 personyears. Eight databases gave rates under 650/100,000 person-years (CPRD-GOLD in the UK;
CUIMC in the US; IPCI in the Netherlands; IQVIA in Australia, France, and Germany; JMDC in
Japan; and SIDIAP-H in Spain), while three databases gave rates more than twice as high, at
over 1,300/100,000 person-years (MDCD, MDCR, and OPTUM-SES in the US). Among women
aged 75 to 84 years, the lowest incidence rate was 585/100,000 person-years (CPRD-GOLD in
the UK) and the highest was 2,167/100,000 person-years (MDCR in the US). We could not find
any consistent patterns to explain which databases yielded higher or lower rates across
outcomes. Appendix Table 4 lists all database-specific incidence rates.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the descriptive epidemiology of the
AESIs prioritised for post-marketing surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines. We report background
rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, and
disseminated intravascular coagulation, which are particularly relevance for COVID-19
vaccines given the observed effects of the SARS-COV-2 virus on coagulopathy.14–17
Our study provides a comprehensive, detailed assessment of the incidence rates of 15 AESIs
across 13 databases, eight countries, and four continents. We found considerable
heterogeneity between geographies and databases, suggesting that caution is needed when
interpreting the difference between any observed and expected rates. We observed
considerable variability with age and sex, emphasizing the need for standardization if
background rates are used for surveillance purposes.
Many countries and organizations, such as the US and EU, have passive spontaneous adverse
event reporting systems, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
However, these systems cannot be used to calculate epidemiological estimates of the burden
of disease, including incidence rates, because they lack denominators, which are the total
number of persons or person-times being observed.18,19 Background incidence rates have
been used to estimate the expected number of events in the general population.3,19 They are
often obtained from the literature, but methods, case and population definitions, data, and
calendar time can vary across publications. In contrast, we calculated all of the presented
estimates using precisely the same setting and common analysis procedures, phenotyping
algorithms, and data model. However, we still found substantial heterogeneity, suggesting
that using a single overall estimate inadequately represents the true uncertainty around event

incidence and may lead to confusion.
Population-level heterogeneity across data sources was substantial for all events, even after
standardizing outcome definitions and stratifying by age and sex. While potentially concerning
when seen together in one analysis, our findings are consistent with what has been observed
in the literature. For example, in our study, the meta-analysis estimated incidence rates of
transverse myelitis ranging from 1 to 4 per 100,000 person-years depend on age-sex strata.
Previous studies have reported overall incidence rates of transverse myelitis ranging from 0·4
to 4·6 per 100,000 person-years.19,20 The rates of Bell’s palsy among those over 65 years old
has ranged from 4·6 per 100,000 person-years in European data to 174 per 100,000 personyears in US data.21,22 Rates of narcolepsy from 1 to over 30 per 100,000 person-years have
been reported among those aged 25 to 44 years.21,22 Recently reported data from the ACCESS
project also showed heterogeneity in background rates.5 This heterogeneity needs to be taken
into account when comparing rates across populations.
Most of the studied outcomes also had considerable within-source patient-level
heterogeneity that followed age and sex patterns. For example, rates of cardiovascular
diseases such as acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic and non- hemorrhagic stroke, deep
vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism increased with age. The incidence of Guillain-Barre
syndrome and Bell’s palsy also increased with age. Narcolepsy and appendicitis were more
common in younger populations. The patterns observed in our study were generally
comparable with previous reports.2,3,21–25 Stratification by age and sex or standardization are
likely to be useful analytic strategies to reduce confounding when comparing incidence rates
across populations. However, the magnitude of heterogeneity across sources within age-sex
subgroups suggest that residual patient-level differences will remain, including the differences
in the distributions of other risk factors such as comorbidities and medication use.
Comparing published results can be limited by differing study methodology, including the
time-at-risk definition, study period, event definitions, population coverage, calendar year,
and geographic location.26 Different subgroup definitions also make direct comparison
difficult. For example, previous studies of Guillain-Barre syndrome have used age strata that
do not fully overlap with each other.2,5,21,25,27,28 In contrast, because we applied the same
definitions, data model, and analysis to all of the databases within our study, the
heterogeneity observed cannot be attributed to analysis variability. Instead, it may have been
due to differences in the underlying populations, healthcare systems, and data capture
processes. Although some variability may have been due to systematic error, selection bias or
differential outcome measurement error between databases, some may reflect true
population differences such as socioeconomic status and comorbidities.
As we observed notable differences between age, sex, and databases, caution should be
exercised when using incidence rates as a basis for comparison. Comparisons between
incidence rates from different sources may be subject to substantial systematic error. We
observed large variations between electronic health records and claims data sources when
using the same analysis and outcome definitions. Comparisons with rates derived from
randomised trials or spontaneous reporting data may have even greater variability. If
observational databases are to be used to inform safety surveillance activities, withindatabase analyses (such as self-controlled case designs or propensity-score adjusted
comparative cohort designs) may help reduce study bias for any given comparison.
Demonstrating consistent effects across databases may further strengthen confidence in
results. If observational data are used to derive historical ‘expected’ rates and compared
against observed rates of events from another source, then the uncertainty in the background
rate must be appropriately integrated to avoid misleading conclusions.
Our large number of participating databases, geographical coverage, and sizable study

population allowed us to provide a comprehensive assessment of the background incidence
rates across different healthcare systems and regions across the globe. Our study took
advantage of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model, which
allowed us to use the same study design and analytical code and to gather results from
participating data partners rapidly and without transferring patient-level data. All outcome
definitions, clinical codes and phenotype algorithms have been made open source and are
available online for review and to maximise reproducibility and reuse.
The primary limitation of this study is that all outcomes may have been subject to
measurement error. As the outcome definitions were based on the presence of specific
diagnostic codes and were not validated further, they may have had imperfect sensitivity or
specificity. The analysis relied on data from 2017 to 2019 using a target population of all
people in each database with >365 days of observation indexed on 1 January, 365 days’ timeat-risk, and outcome-specific clean windows to allow for recurrent events. The impact of these
design decisions should be explored further.

Conclusion
This study comprehensively assessed the descriptive epidemiology of potential AESIs for
COVID-19 vaccines. It highlighted the wide range of adverse effects being monitored, from
very rare neurological disorders to more common thromboembolic conditions. We reported
large variations in the observable rates of AESI by age group and sex, demonstrating the need
to account for stratification or standardization before using background rates for safety
surveillance. We also found significant population-level heterogeneity in AESI rates between
databases, implying that individual study estimates should be interpreted with caution and
systematic error associated with database choice should be incorporated into any analysis.
These background rates should provide useful real-world context to inform public health
efforts aimed at ensuring patient safety while promoting the appropriate use of vaccines
worldwide.
