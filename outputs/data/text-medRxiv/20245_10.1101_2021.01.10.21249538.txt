ABSTRACT

Objective: To describe the prevalence of factors related to wellbeing among primary school
children in a deprived multi-ethnic community.

Design and participants: Cross-sectional survey of 15,641 children aged 7-10 years in Born
in Bradford’s Primary School Years study: whole-classroom samples in 89 Bradford primary
schools between 2016 and 2019.

Main outcome measures: Prevalence estimates by ethnicity (%, 95% CI) of single and
multiple vulnerabilities in child wellbeing within and across four domains (home, family,
relationships; material resources; friends and school; subjective wellbeing).

Results Only 10% of children have no vulnerabilities in any domain of wellbeing; 10% have
one or more vulnerabilities in all four domains. The highest prevalence estimates were for
being bullied some or all of the time (52.7%, 51.9 to 53.4%), keeping worries to oneself
(31.2%, 30.5 to 31.9%), having no park near home (30.8%, 30.1 to 31.5%) and worrying all
the time about how much money their family has (26.3%, 25.6 to 27%).

Boys were consistently significantly more likely than girls to report all of the vulnerabilities
in the Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, and the majority of indicators in the
other domains, and in all domains except Friends and School, boys were significantly more
likely to have at least one vulnerability. Girls were significantly more likely to report not
having many friends (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.9 to 17.6% vs. 12.5%, 95% CI: 11.8 to 13.2%),
being bullied some or all of the time (55.8%, 95% CI: 54.7 to 56.9% vs. 49.7%, 95% CI: 48.6
to 50.8%) and feeling left out all the time (12.1%, 95% CI: 11.4 to 12.8%) vs. 10.3%, 95%
CI: 9.7 to 11.0%).
Variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity were complex, with children in Black, Asian and
Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and sometimes fewer than
White British children. For example, compared to children of Pakistani heritage, White
British children were more likely to say that their family never gets along well (6.3%,5.6 to
7.1% vs. 4.1%,3.6 to 4.6%) and to have no access to the internet at home (22.3%,21 to 23.6%
vs. 18%,17 to 18.9%). Children with Pakistani heritage were more likely than White British

children to say they had no park near their home where they can play with friends
(32.7%,31.6 to 33.9% vs. 29.9%,28.6 to 31.3%), to report not having three meals a day
(17.9%,16.9 to 18.8% vs. 11.9%,10.9 to 12.9%) and to worry all the time about how much
money their families have (29.3%,28.2 to 30.3%) vs. 21.6%,20.4 to 22.9%). Gypsy/Irish
Traveller children were less likely than White British children to say they were bullied some
or all of the time (42.2%,35.4 to 49.4% vs. 53.8%,52.3 to 55.3%), but more likely to say they
were mean to others all the time (9.9%,6.3 to 15.2% vs. 4%,3.5 to 4.7%) and can never work
out what to do when things are hard (15.2%,10.6 to 21.2% vs. 9%, 8.2 to 9.9%).
We considered six vulnerabilities to be of particular concern during the current Covid-19
pandemic and associated national and local lockdowns: family never gets along well together;
no garden where child can play; no nearby park where they can play; not having 3 meals a
day; no internet at home; worried about money all the time. Pre-pandemic, 37.4% (36.6 to
38.3%) of Bradford children had one of these vulnerabilities and a further 29.6% (28.9 to
30.4%) had more than one.
Conclusions
Although most primary school children aged 7-10 in our study have good levels of wellbeing
on most indicators across multiple domains, fewer than 10% have no vulnerabilities at all, a
worrying 10% have at least one vulnerability in all the four domains we studied and two
thirds have vulnerabilities of concern during the Covid-19 lockdowns.

Introduction
In 2007, the UK ranked bottom of 21 countries in UNICEF’s first report on child wellbeing
in rich countries,1 and from 2009 through 2019 the Good Childhood inquiry2 and subsequent
reports from the Children’s Society3 have found increasing levels of unhappiness and mental
distress among children and young people in the UK. The State of the Nation 2019 report on
children and young people’s wellbeing suggested a need to “understand wellbeing across
different groups” and to “use a range of measures to understand their experience.”4
Wellbeing declines as children and young people grow older4 but little is known about
wellbeing in primary school aged children in the UK as previous studies, including the Good
Childhood surveys, Understanding Society and HeadStart, include children over 10 years old
only. The impact of ethnicity on child wellbeing at any age is unclear and most previous UK
studies are unable to examine wellbeing across a wide range of ethnicities.4 To provide
evidence to meet these knowledge gaps, we examined child wellbeing among primary school
children, aged 7 to 10 years, in a city in the North of England. Bradford is the fifth largest
metropolitan district in England with one of the youngest and most ethnically diverse
populations.5 Bradford also has some of the highest levels of poverty and ill-health in
England; almost a quarter of Bradford children live in poverty and 24% are obese at age
10/11.6
The global Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions, such as lockdowns that closed schools,
heightened concerns about child wellbeing across the world. The prevalence of pre-existing
child vulnerabilities and risk factors that could potentially require mitigation and targeted
intervention during and after the pandemic has been a concern, particularly in poor, ethnically
diverse urban settings.7 The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence of vulnerabilities
in child wellbeing by ethnicity and gender in a deprived community. Whilst this research is
undertaken in the city of Bradford and has been used to support local policy during the
COVID-19 pandemic,8 we believe the results have wider relevance for deprived multi-ethnic
urban settings.

Methods (for STROBE statement see Supplementary Materials: 1)
Setting and Participants
Born in Bradford (BiB) is a cohort study of 13,500 children born between 2007-2011.9
Between 2016 and 2019, BiB administered the Primary School Years study as a crosssectional survey of wellbeing of children aged 7-10 years in 89 Bradford schools (Figure 1).
We surveyed whole classrooms, including children previously recruited to the ongoing BiB
cohort study as well as non-BiB children. The study protocol and detailed methods of school
recruitment are described elsewhere.10 11 Schools were given information sheets and opt-out
consent forms to give to parents of children in eligible year groups ahead of the school visit;
one school asked for opt-in consent to be used and this was accommodated. Fewer than 5%
of parents opted out of the study.

Design and Procedures
Ethical approval was obtained from the NHS Health Research Authority’s Yorkshire and the
Humber - Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (reference: 16/YH/0062) on the 24th
March 2016.
The wellbeing survey (“Me and My Life”) was developed for this study (see Supplementary
Materials: 2), drawing on questions asked of children in the Millennium Cohort Study,12 the
International Survey of Children’s Wellbeing13 and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children.14 The survey aimed to assess children’s wellbeing in multiple domains,
including: happiness, health, material wellbeing, relationships with family and friends, school
experience, neighbourhood, aspirations and acculturation. ‘Think aloud’ testing with a small
group of children was used to check understanding and face validity. During administration,
whole classrooms completed the survey at the same time, supported by three research
facilitators.
Schools provided class lists, including date of birth, gender and ethnicity. Child ethnicity is
reported by parents on registration with a school. The ethnicity information provided from
school records contained 192 categories. These were re-coded into 18 broad groups in line
with the 2011 census categorisation of ethnic groups in the UK and for the analyses presented
here collapsed into 10 categories: Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian, Black/Black British, White
British, Mixed, Gypsy/Irish Traveller, Other White, Other, and Unknown. Where ethnicity
was missing it was possible to supplement, for BiB children only, with data held by BiB
(n=311).
To assess vulnerabilities in wellbeing, we grouped questions within four domains: (1) home,
family and family relationships, (2) material resources, (3) friends and school, (4) subjective
(self-reported) wellbeing. Within each domain, we defined ‘vulnerabilities’ on (a) the basis of
research literature showing these to be well-established childhood risk factors for long-term
health, wellbeing, educational attainment, and social mobility and (b) subsequent consultation
with the vulnerabilities workstream of the Bradford Institute for Health Research Covid-19
Scientific Advisory Group (BIHR C-SAG) (https://www.bradfordresearch.nhs.uk/vulnerablegroups/). The risk factors categorised as vulnerabilities include, by domain:

• Home, family, family relationships: family never gets along well together, no garden
where child can play, no nearby park where they can play, never plays in park
• Material resources: no warm winter coat, not having 3 meals a day, no internet at home,
worried about money all the time
• Friends and school: doesn’t like school, not many friends, bullied some or all of the time,
mean to others all the time, feel left out all the time
• Subjective wellbeing: never happy, always sad, ill/unwell all of the time, keeps worries to
self, can never work out what to do when things are hard
Data Analysis
Socio-demographics and the prevalence of vulnerabilities in child wellbeing are presented as
counts and/or percentages with 95% confidence intervals, for all children and by gender and
ethnicity. We also describe the number and percent of children with multiple vulnerabilities
within and across domains of wellbeing by gender and ethnicity. Children with missing data
for any answer are excluded from the relevant analyses and number of missing reported in
figures and tables.

Figure 1: Percent of primary school children with each vulnerability across domains of
wellbeing*

* For 15,641 children: each item has missing data of 3% or less, with the exception of items “No winter coat”,
“Not having three meals a day” and “No internet at home” which have around 10% missing data. For more
details, and confidence intervals, see Supplementary Materials: Table S1.

Although the prevalence of vulnerability varies by item and domain, within each domain
there is an item with notably high prevalence, with more than one in four children reporting
vulnerability: no park near home (30.8%, 95% CI: 30.1-31.5%); worried about money all the
time (26.3%, 95% CI: 25.6-27.0%); bullied some or all of the time (52.7%, 95% CI: 51.953.4%); and keeping worries to self (31.2%, 95% CI: 30.5-31.9%). We considered six
vulnerabilities in child wellbeing would be of particular concern during lockdowns and
school closures associated with the Covid-19 pandemic: family never gets along well
together; no garden where child can play; no nearby park where they can play; not having 3
meals a day; no internet at home; worried about money all the time. Before the pandemic
37.4% (36.6-38.3%) of children had one of these vulnerabilities and a further 29.6% (28.930.4%) had more than one.

Figure 2: Percentage of primary school children with zero, one, or more than one
vulnerability in each domain of wellbeing*

*For 15,641 children: the percentage with missing data for at least one item in each domain is between 5% and
16%. For more details, and confidence intervals, see Supplementary Materials: Table S2.

Although the majority of children have no vulnerabilities in the Home, Family, Relationships
domain (55.9%, 95% CI: 55.0-56.7%) and the Subjective Wellbeing domain (57.4%, 95% CI:
56.6-58.2%), the majority of children have one or more vulnerabilities in the Material
Resources, and Friends and School domains. Only 10% (add 95% CI) of children have no
vulnerabilities in any domain of wellbeing. Figure 3 is a Venn diagram that shows how
vulnerabilities overlap across domains. 1,494 (10%) children have no vulnerabilities. Each
oval in the Venn diagram includes all the children who have one or more vulnerabilities
within that domain; so, for example, 2% of children have vulnerabilities in Home, Family,
Relationships and Subjective Wellbeing but not in other domains. 1,519 children (10%) have
one or more vulnerabilities in all four domains.

Variation by gender
Boys were consistently significantly more likely to report all of the vulnerabilities in the
Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, although the gender differences were not
large (see Supplementary Materials: Table 3 for full results, including 95% confidence
intervals, for all domains by gender). There were no gender differences in having access to
the internet at home, but boys were significantly more likely to report not having a winter
coat (11.1%, 95% CI: 10.4-11.9% vs 8.9%, 95% CI: 8.2-9.6%), not having three meals a day
(17.7%, 95% CI: 16.8-18.6%) vs 14.0%, 95% CI: 13.3-14.9%) and worrying about money all
the time (28.9%, 95% CI: 28.0-30.0%) vs. 23.4%, 95% CI: 22.5-24.4%). Within the Friends
and School domain, boys were significantly more likely to not like school (18.0%, 95% CI:
17.1-18.8%) vs. 8%, 95% CI: 7.4-8.6%) and to be mean to others all the time (7.0%, 95% CI:

6.4-7.6% vs. 3.4%, 95% CI: 3.0-3.8%), while girls were significantly more likely to report
not having many friends (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.9-17.6% vs. 12.5%, 95% CI: 11.8-13.2%),
being bullied some or all of the time (55.8%, 95% CI: 54.7-56.9% vs. 49.7%, 95% CI: 48.650.8%) and feeling left out all the time (12.1%, 95% CI: 11.4-12.8%) vs. 10.3%, 95% CI:
9.7-11.0%). Within the Subjective Wellbeing domain there were no gender differences in
being always sad or always ill or unwell, but boys were significantly likely to report never
being happy (5.2%, 95% CI: 4.7-5.7%) vs. 2.4%, 95% CI: 2.1-2.8%), keeping worries to
themselves (33.7%, 95% CI: 32.7-34.8% vs. 28.5%, 95% CI: 27.5-29.6%) and not being
about to work out what to do when things are hard (9.6%, 95% CI: 9.0-10.3% vs. 7.5%, 95%
CI: 6.9-8.1%). In all domains except for Friends and School, boys were significantly more
likely to have at least one vulnerability, compared to girls.
Variation by ethnicity
Figures 4a-4d shows the percentages (and 95% confidence intervals) of primary school
children with at least one vulnerability within each of the domains of child wellbeing, by
ethnicity. Full results are given in Supplementary Materials, Tables S4a-4d.
Home, family, relationships
Compared to White British children, Pakistani, White Other and Black/Black British children
were significantly less likely to say their family never get along well together. White Other
and Other children were significantly more likely to not have a garden where they can play,
compared to White British children. Compared to White British children, Pakistani children
were significantly more likely, and Black/Black British children significantly less likely to
have no park near home where they can play with friends. Compared to White British
children, Pakistani children were significantly less likely to say they never play in a park.

Material resources
There were no significant ethnic differences in the proportion of children who did not have a
warm winter coat. Compared to White British children, Pakistani, Indian and Gypsy/Traveller
children, as well as children of Mixed ethnicity were significantly more likely to report not
having three meals a day. Pakistani, White Other, Indian and Black/Black British children
were significantly less likely to report having no internet at home than White British children.
Compared to White British children, Pakistani, White Other, Bangladeshi and Gypsy/Irish
Traveller children were significantly more likely to worry all the time about how much
money their families have.

Friends and school
Pakistani, White Other and Indian children were significantly less likely to report not liking
school than White British children, and Bangladeshi and Black/British were significantly less
likely to report not having many friends. Compared to White British children, White Other
and Gypsy/Irish Traveller children were significantly less likely to say they were bullied
some or all of the time, and Pakistani children and Gypsy/Irish traveller children were
significantly more likely to say they were mean to others all the time. There were no
significant ethnic differences in the proportion of children who felt left out by others all the
time.

Subjective wellbeing
There were no significant ethnic differences in the proportion of children who said they were
never happy or were always sad or who said they keep worries to themselves. Compared to
White British children, only Pakistani children were significantly more likely to say they
were always ill or unwell. Compared to White British children, Bangladeshi children were
significantly less likely, and Gypsy/Irish traveller children more likely, to say they cannot
work out what to do when things are hard.

Discussion
Statement of Principal Findings
Although most primary school children aged 7-10 in Bradford have good levels of
wellbeing on most indicators across multiple domains, fewer than 10% have no
vulnerabilities at all, and a worrying 10% have more than one vulnerability in all the four
domains we studied. Variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity were complex, with children
in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and
sometimes fewer than White British children. We considered six vulnerabilities to be of
particular concern during the current Covid-19 pandemic and associated national and local
lockdowns (family never gets along well together; no garden where child can play; no
nearby park where they can play; not having 3 meals a day; no internet at home; worried
about money all the time). Before the pandemic, the majority – two-thirds – of Bradford
children had one or more of these vulnerabilities. The domain with the highest proportion of
children reporting vulnerabilities was Friends and School with 1 in 20 children reporting
that they are mean to other children all the time, more than 1 in 10 reporting feeling left out
all the time, not having many friends and not liking school, and the majority of children
reporting being bullied some or all of the time.
We found that boys reported significantly more vulnerabilities for all indicators in the
Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, as well as for the majority of indicators in
the Material Resources, Friends and School, and Subjective Wellbeing domains. This
contrasts with the finding of few consistent gender differences in wellbeing and a trend
towards worse wellbeing in girls in the UK State of the Nation 2019: Children and Young
People’s Wellbeing report4, and the general picture in the research literature of worse
wellbeing for adolescent girls15 16 and inconsistent gender differences among adults.17 18
These differences may be due to the younger age of our sample, and suggest that worse
wellbeing among adolescent girls might not be inevitable if prevention efforts were started
before secondary education.
We found complex variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity, with children in Black, Asian
and Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and sometimes fewer
than White British children. For example, compared to children of Pakistani heritage, White
British children were more likely to say that their family never gets along well and to have
no access to the internet at home, whereas children with Pakistani heritage were more likely

than White British children to say they had no park near their home where they can play
with friends, to report not having three meals a day and to worry all the time about how
much money their families have. The UK State of the Nation 2019: Children and Young
People’s Wellbeing report drew attention to the importance of “moving beyond the average”
in understanding wellbeing but reported “no discernible differences in wellbeing
by…ethnicity” whilst recognising that small sample sizes might have obscured differences
and reporting statistics only for 5 broadly defined ethnic groups. We provide a detailed
description of wellbeing for 9 ethnic groups, so that nuances in ethnic variation can be better
understood, including for smaller ethnic groups. For example, we found that Gypsy/Irish
Traveller children were less likely than White British children to say they were bullied some
or all of the time, but more likely to say they were mean to others, can never work out what
to do when things are hard, worry all the time about how much money their family has, and
not have 3 meals a day.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
To our knowledge, ours is the only large contemporary study of wellbeing in primary school
aged children in England, with sufficient numbers of children belonging to some of the
UK’s smaller Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic communities to be able to describe their
wellbeing. Our approach to school recruitment, opt-out consent and whole classroom
testing, along with Born in Bradford’s longstanding trusting relationships with schools and
communities ensured a very high response rate. Although our study is based in a single city,
it is likely to be generalizable to other UK cities with high levels of ethnic diversity and
deprivation.
The fact that our measures of wellbeing are self-reported by children is both a strength and a
potential weakness. It has been argued that, for adults and children alike, the subjective
experience of quality of life matters, and that, as feelings have a demonstrable objective
neuropsychological reality and are correlated with objective health, social and economic
outcomes, they are worthy of measurement and inference. 19 20 Clearly, our measures of
vulnerability not only include things that can only be measured subjectively, such as
happiness or feeling left out, but also things that arguably would be better measured
objectively, e.g., having access to a garden or three meals a day. However, it is possible that
even for measures such as these, children’s perceptions that they lack material resources
may be important even if they actually have the resources.

Our data collection objectives and approach to categorising vulnerabilities in wellbeing is
very different to the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) approach21 and the definition
and measurement of extreme child vulnerabilities collated and reported by the Children’s
Commissioner for England (https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/chldrn/). ACEs are
traumatic experiences that include abuse and neglect, parental mental illness, substance use
and divorce. The child vulnerabilities reported by the Children’s Commissioner include
living in a household where an adult has a drug or alcohol dependence, where an adult has
experienced violence or abuse from a partner, where an adult has a clinically diagnosable
mental health condition or more than one of these factors. Both ACEs and the Children’s
Commissioner approaches identify factors that put children at immediate, as well as longterm, risk of harm. Our approach was to collect data on more common risk factors with
known long-term consequences for health and wellbeing, to better understand children's
subjective experiences across the whole population.
In our school-based whole classroom surveys, time constraints and study design prevented
data collection and analyses that would have allowed us to go beyond description and
investigate the causes of vulnerabilities in child wellbeing. For BiB children only, we
examined associations between neighbourhood area deprivation (Index of Multiple
Deprivation) and vulnerabilities. We found no significant associations for any domain
except for more vulnerabilities in Material Resources at higher levels of deprivation, and as
lack of material resources is definitional for deprivation do not report those analyses here.
We plan future data collection with this sample to allow us to examine how vulnerabilities
at primary school ages shape trajectories of wellbeing across time.
Implications for providers of services to children and policymakers
Our findings suggest that, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, a substantial number of children
were experiencing sub-optimal wellbeing with potential lifelong consequences, with
implications for all providers of services to children, as well as local and national
policymakers. As the economic impact of the pandemic is increasing child poverty, income
insecurity, food and housing insecurity, parental mental health challenges and family
violence, the need for attention to the identification and amelioration of vulnerability is
heightened.22 The International Society for Social Pediatrics and Child Health has called for
the adoption of “a Child Rights Based Approach (CRBA) to respond to the COVID-19
pandemic, and to advance a future in which the health, development and well-being of

children and youth are prioritised with explicit strategies to reduce health inequities and
advance social justice” (https://www.issop.org/2020/06/01/issop-covid-19-declaration/).
Such an approach can underpin and inform services and policy making at all levels.
As the population was encouraged to ‘lockdown’ at home and schools closed for almost all
children (and attendance was very low for those who were eligible to go to school) for
varying periods, the response to the pandemic will have affected children’s wellbeing (as
well as their educational trajectories) differently, depending on their circumstances and
context. Children who found school a nurturing refuge from difficult home situations will
have suffered from school shutdowns, whereas others who found school a challenging
environment may have been happy to be at home for a prolonged period; most children have
probably experienced both positive and negative impacts. Although all schools work hard to
create safe and supportive environments for children, the high levels of bullying and social
isolation that we report suggests that more needs to be done to make this a reality for all
children. In addition, the high prevalence of children with no access to the internet at home
and no access to a garden or park mean that many children will have at times been unable to
study or be physically active.
Locally, our research team has engaged with our local authority, public health, NHS and
voluntary sector colleagues to identify principles to mitigate the impact of lockdown exit on
vulnerable groups (https://www.bradfordresearch.nhs.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/CSAG-Briefing-Paper-Vulnerable-Groups-and-Recovery230420.pdf). We have proposed additional support for children and young people in the
lockdown exit and recovery planning, including assessing the impact of decision making on
children, prioritising children’s needs, providing extra support for vulnerable children, and
monitoring impacts on children’s lives and wellbeing.

Conclusions and implications for public health
Among primary school children aged 7-10 in a deprived Northern city in the UK, fewer than
10% have no vulnerabilities in home, family and family relationships, material resources,
friends and school and subjective wellbeing, while 10% have more than one vulnerability in
all of these domains. These children are at risk of poor health, social and economic
trajectories throughout their lives that could be mitigated by policy focused at structural

Summary

What is already known on this topic
•

Child wellbeing in the UK is low in comparison to other rich countries

•

Little is known about the wellbeing of children under the age of 10 in the UK

•

Little is known about ethnic variations in child wellbeing in the UK

What this study adds
•

Although most 7-10 year old children in our study have good levels of wellbeing,

fewer than 10% have no vulnerabilities at all, a worrying 10% have at least one
vulnerability in all the domains we studied, and two thirds have vulnerabilities of
concern during the Covid-19 lockdowns
•

In contrast to studies of older children, boys had more wellbeing vulnerabilities,

although girls were more likely to have no friends, report being bullied and feeling left
out.
•

Ethnic variations in vulnerabilities in wellbeing were complex, with children from

ethnic minorities reporting fewer of some vulnerabilities than White British children and
more of others; our study is the first to report a wide range of vulnerabilities across a
large number of ethnic groups in this age range
