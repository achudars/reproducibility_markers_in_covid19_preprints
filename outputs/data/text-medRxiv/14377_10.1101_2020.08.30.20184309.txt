SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a novel human pathogen, causing clinical signs, from
fever to pneumonia – COVID-19 – but may remain mild or even asymptomatic. To
understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected,
and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARSCoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed and have been setup around
the world. We quantified immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG and IgA antibodies recognizing
the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period
of five months following COVID-19 disease onset or in previously SARS-CoV-2 PCRpositive volunteers. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune
response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500
University staff and 187 post-COVID19 volunteers, and assessing titres for IgM, IgG and
IgA. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses followed a classic pattern with a rapid
increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce from
approximately four weeks, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remained robust
for five months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our
work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and
longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it highlights a
continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2, at least up to five months after infection.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 infection, causes a wide variety of disease symptoms, from fever, asthenia
or myalgia, to pneumonia and in most severe cases acute respiratory distress syndrome,
referred to as COVID-19. Yet, a large amount of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients remains
asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 rapid spread around the world was declared a global
pandemic in March 2020. It remains a continuing threat to health and socio-economic
wellbeing. Despite the global number of infections reaching tens of millions, including
almost one million fatalities, due to mitigation measures, the overall infection rate is
relatively low with local infection hotspots. Although scientific progress is rapid, there
remains a pressing need to understand the immune response that follows SARS-CoV-2
infection, including its role during disease and especially its potential long-term protective
effects.
A prime immune target during coronavirus infections is the spike (S) protein, closely
associated with and targeted by neutralising antibody responses and protective
immunity, in contrast to most other viral proteins [1-4]. The S protein is responsible for
the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cells via binding ACE2 [5-7]. It can be
divided into two regions, S1 and S2. The extra-viral S1 region contains within its second
domain the receptor binding domain (RBD) [8]. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence shows
limited homology with seasonal coronaviruses or EMC/2012, the cause of Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD shares 73% of its
sequence with the RBD of SARS [3].
Attempts to curtail and control the SARS-CoV-2 virus rely on increasing inter-personal
distance, including the closure of much social and economic activity, as well as testing
for acute infection and personal hygiene measures. This was implemented early during
the outbreak, with the University of Lisbon closing after March 13th, 10 days after the first
recorded cases in Portugal. However, during the subsequent transition phase,
restrictions have steadily been lifted. The gradual return to social and economic activity
requires active surveillance to determine local outbreaks, contact tracing and quarantine.
In addition, those most vulnerable to COVID-19 will need to remain under enhanced
protection. Important information is how protective immunity develops in th e population
at large and in specific groups such as healthcare professionals. A thorough assessment
of the duration of protective immunity is critical to determine the measures that need to
be taken to prevent and handle future waves of SARS-CoV-2. Such information will need
to be gathered widely, in different locations around the world, reflecting local condi tions,
such as containment measures and their timing. The data obtained will need to be

accurate and the methods used transparent and reproducible to enable comparisons
between locations and countries. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak brings limitations
with respect to exposure time, but also gives us the opportunity to acquire real-time data
and develop reliable longitudinal follow up studies.
To determine the cumulative rate of infection in communities and gaining insight into the
potential protection against re-infection, serological assays are critical. Depending on the
aims of the study, the setup of such assays can be used for the detection of exposure to
SARS-CoV-2 as well as gaining insights into neutralisation activity, since antibody titres
for both the S protein and RBD have been shown to correlate well with neutralising
activity [3, 9-11]. We describe the detailed setup and versatility of a seroconversion
assay to determine humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 that was used for screening
hospital patients, healthy post-COVID19 volunteers and staff of the University of Lisbon.
We report that in the acute phase men produce more antibodies than women, but levels
equilibrate during the resolution phase and are similar between the genders in the
months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
Spike and its RBD domain are readily detectable in the majority of cases, including in
patients receiving immune suppressive or anti-retroviral therapy. In line with a classic
immune response, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood peak around week 3 post
infection, and although titres reduce, IgG antibodies remain detectable for at least 5
months.

Results
Seroconversion assay setup
To detect seroconversion, point-of-care devices are practical and desirable. However,
without the investment in development and the proper equipment, the use of lateral flow
assays have limited success with respect to sensitivity and antibody titres cannot be
determined. The gold standard for antibody detection remains the enzyme -linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), offering high flexibility and sensitivity, but limited
scalability [11]. SARS-CoV-2 Spike is a prominent immunogenic antigen and its RBD is
least conserved compared with other coronaviruses. Hence, the use of Spike and its
RBD quickly became the focus of seroconversion assays. We chose for the present
study the assay developed by Florian Krammer and his laboratory, a format that received
FDA emergency approval in April 2020 and is described in detail [12].
Human sera pose a biological hazard to laboratory workers and can potentially contain
not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other infectious viruses. Therefore, all ELISA steps were

performed at biosafety level (BSL) 2, with BSL3 personal protective equipment.
Inactivation procedures are recommended but can have uncertain effects on the
accuracy of serological testing [13]. We tested three common procedures: a) one hour
heat inactivation at 56°C, or b) the addition of a non-ionic surfactant (0.1% Triton X-100),
or c) the combination of both, in comparison to neat serum. Serial dilutions of two chosen
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive serum samples showed IgG detection following all three
inactivation methods and was indiscriminate from untreated controls (Fig.1A).
The S protein has a trimeric structure, while the in vitro expression of RBD results in the
generation of monomeric and dimeric protein. However, when we tested the ability of
RBD mono- and dimeric protein for antibody binding, both performed similar and
comparable to the total protein fraction (Fig.1B). Additional parameters affecting the
performance of ELISA assays, such as the coating time (o/n – 1 week at 4°C), serum
incubation time and temperature, as well as the amount of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
substrate and the development time (adjusted to 10 minutes) were optimised
(Suppl.Fig.1A, data not shown). Coated plates were stable for a week, and incubation of
1 or 2 hours at room temperature or 37°C were indistinguishable. To ensure that the
ELISAs runs at non-saturating conditions, we performed a full titration of the capture
antigens (from 0.125µg/mL-10µg/mL) and the secondary antibodies (1:5000-1:100000)
used for antibody detection. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were titrated and assessed using
individual patient sera (high, medium and low titres). Simultaneously, the secondary
antibodies were titrated, such as anti-IgG, but also anti-IgM, anti-IgA and anti-total Ig,
whereby optical density (OD) of 2.0 was used as an upper limit to avoid saturation of the
assay (Fig.1C-E, Suppl.Fig.1B-G).
In order to prepare for diagnostic use, the generation of quality control (QC) serum is
critical to validate each assay run. Sera from exposed patients is most desirable as it will
contain antibodies with a range of avidities and isotypes, providing more stable binding
properties. However, sufficient volume needs to be obtained to ensure that there is
enough material to complete the ELISA validation process and the study or series of
studies to be undertaken. Sera from four SARS-CoV-2 exposed but healthy volunteers
were assessed and pooled to serve as quality control for subsequent assays (Fig.1F).
Ultimately, antibody signals should diminish in a dose-dependent way using serial
dilutions of the sera, enabling the accurate determination of antibody titres
(Suppl.Fig.1H).

Seroconversion assay validation

We used 100 pre-COVID-19 sera from healthy volunteers collected between October
2012 and November 2017 as negative controls (Table 1). Furthermore, we obtained 19
sera from PCR positive hospital healthcare workers with mainly mild symptoms, just over
30 days since first symptoms and the positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (Table 2).
Seroconversion was detected in the sera of all SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients using
the RBD part of SARS-CoV-2 S antigen and 18/19 using the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S
protein by probing for IgG (Fig.2A). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)
determined sensitivity and specificity and the assays cut-off, at 0.4171 and 0.4816 for
RBD and S protein respectively, corresponding to 100% specificity and 99% sensitivity
for RBD and 94.74% specificity and 98% sensitivity for Spike in this initial analysis
(Fig.2B-C, Table 3).
In order to increase pre-COVID-19 sample size and reflect a broader spectrum of the
population, we obtained 60 samples of individuals with food allergies and 30 samples
from individuals with bee and wasp allergies, because these contain increased levels of
antibodies [14]. Serum from allergic subjects increased the observed background on
both RBD and Spike proteins (Fig.2D). Of importance, increased reactivity to one protein
was often not observed on the second SARS-CoV-2 protein (Fig.2E), substantiating the
two-step process of screening for RBD and subsequently those sera found positive for
Spike [12].

Seroconversion screening of COVID-19 hospitalised patients
We subsequently analysed 307 samples from hospitalised patients who tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR for the presence of antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG. Samples were
acquired between April 6 th and August 12 th, 2020 and at different times after the
development of COVID-19 symptoms. The patients demonstrated a variety of symptoms
and underlying medical conditions (Table 1). Seroconversion screening resulted in
varied optical density measurements (Fig.3A). In line with the number of days normally
taken by adaptive cellular immunity to be initiated, antibody detection in samples 14-days
past first symptoms was robust in 78/78 (100%) samples on RBD and 76/78 (97.4%) on
Spike protein (Fig.3B). Although antibody responses take time to mature, around half of
the samples showed robust IgG seroconversion within the first week of symptoms, 40/78
(51%) and 39/78 (50%) on RBD and Spike respectively (Fig.3C). Follow up samples from
68 patients showed that those who had seroconverted in the first week of symptoms
maintained high levels of IgG one week later (27/27, 100%). From those who did not
have an IgG response within the first week, 30/41 (73%) showed a robust response

seven days later. The remaining 11/41 (27%) patients had their second sample analysed
in the second week after onset of symptoms, but still did not show an IgG response.
However, although some patients did not show an IgG response in the second or even
third week after onset of symptoms, those that were tested again one week later all
seroconverted (10/10) (Fig.3D). From those who did not seroconvert within week two of
COVID-19 symptoms (11/41, 27%), some had underlying conditions, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1), lymphoma (1), chemotherapy (1), or immunosuppressive
medication (3).
Some patients who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive within an average of 8.7 days (-1 53) after blood was taken, did not show any classic COVID-19 symptoms (Table 1). Of
these, 20/40 (50%) showed seroconversion for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Fig.3E). Since no
symptoms were reported, it remained unclear at what stage of the infection these
patients were. Those who were IgG negative may have been within the first days of
infection, or antibody levels were very low. However, repeat sampling from several
patients seven days later revealed that only 3/11 (27%) patients seroconverted, although
optical density remained modest, while in 6/11 (55%) anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels
remained below the assay´s cut off (Fig.3F). This suggest a limited or much delayed
seroconversion response.

Effect of demographics, immunomodulatory and anti-viral medication on seroconversion
IgG seroconversion, 14-days after onset of symptoms, was detected equally well
between female and male patients, independently of age, and for both RBD and spike
protein (Fig.4A-B). Seroconversion detection or the antibody response, since patients
were assayed on average 8.5 days after being SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, were reduced
or delayed in those asymptomatic for COVID-19 compared with those experiencing
COVID-19 symptoms (Fig.4C). In line with an adaptive immune response taking several
days to develop, the main factor influencing seroconversion was time since onset of
COVID-19 symptoms (Fig.4D).
Within the hospital patient cohort, two groups were of special interest. Those on
immunosuppressive therapy and those, receiving anti-viral medication due to infections
with either human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Table 4).
Within the patient cohort receiving immunosupressive medication, 7/29 (24%) were
asymptomatic for COVID-19, while 3/12 (25%) of those on anti-viral medication did not
have COVID-19 symptoms. The average seroconversion rate in both groups was below

those seen in the collective patient cohort or the healthcare workers, at 9/29 (31%) and
9/12 (75%) of those on immunosuppressive medication or anti-viral therapy (Table 4).
Within the hospital cohort we obtained 29 sera from patients who received
immunosuppressive drugs, including 13/29 (40%) receiving the glucocorticoids
Prednisolone or Dexamethasone. Sera of these patients were collected between day 235 post-COVID-19 symptom onset. In this cohort, all patients tested SARS-CoV-2
positive by PCR, 20/29 (69%) did not seroconvert (Fig.4E). Out of these 20, seven (35%)
were asymptomatic, three (15%) were tested within seven days of symptoms. In line with
required T cell help for isotype switching, 3/5 (67%) patients on the calcineurin inhibitor
Tacrolimus, which was combined with Prednisolone, did not seroconvert. Use of
corticosteroids had an inhibitory effect on antibody production, with those patients that
seroconverted showing a low signal. The patient on chemotherapy ( Paclitaxel) did not
show an anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG response. Three (3/29, 10%) patients receiving
immunomodulatory drugs showed a similar anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG response compared
with patients without such medication (day 5-13). Two of these received either
Prednisolone or Methotrexate. Although the number of patients tested was modest,
these findings indicate that immunosuppresive medications inhibits seroconversion upon
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Twelve samples were from patients who previously contracted HIV1 or HIV2 and were
treated with anti-retroviral therapy (Raltegravir, Darunavir/Cobicistat, Lamivudine and
Dolutegravir) and one with HBV receiving Entecavir. All patients were male and SARSCoV-2 seroconversion was analysed within 11 days of symptom onset. Most patients
(9/12, 75%) seroconverted (Fig.4F). Of the remaining three HIV patients, two were
asymptomatic and one was an early sample taken only three days after COVID -19
symptoms. These results suggest that anti-retroviral medication does not interfere with
SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.

Large seroconversion screen shows limited SARS-CoV-2 exposure
The University of Lisbon decided to close for all non-essential work early during COVID19 outbreak, starting from midnight March 13 th. Since the initial outbreak, reported
infection levels in Portugal have remained modest compared with nearby European
countries, with 5200 cases per million of the population reported (Johns Hopkins,
Worldometer, August 2020). To determine the seroprevalence in University staff, we
screened 2571 employees, across all divisions, with serum obtained between May 13th
and July 10 th 2020. As mentioned, our assay is based on Stadlbauer et al., [12] that

received emergency FDA approval utilising a two-step method. With the expectation of
a low infection prevalence, we first screened staff in a single dilution using the setup as
depicted in Figure 5A. We detected 68 samples with an OD above the cut off value of
0.41 (2.6%) (Fig.5B). These samples were subsequently reassessed, using both RBD
and Spike protein as well as two serum dilutions, 1/50 and 1/150, as depicted in Figure
5C. Of the 68 tested samples, 38 (56%) were confirmed positive during the second assay
(Fig.5D,E), resulting in an infection prevalence of 1.5%. Samples with an intermediate
signal for RBD, often just above the cut off, frequently failed the second assay on Spike
or even RBD (Fig.5E,F) and some samples with a robust RBD signal did not respond to
Spike protein at all. As previously observed (Figure 2), signals between RBD and Spike
protein were often comparable, with only a few samples showing a stronger response
against Spike. Samples providing a robust signal for RBD often responded similarly with
Spike (Fig.5G). To ensure ODs between plates are comparable, the assays inter -plate
variation was determined using two dilutions of a QC serum sample or monoclonal
antibody (QChi and QClo) run in each plate. Although day-to-day plate variability is
present, this is of very modest amplitude (Fig.5H). The average and standard deviation
of QChi OD values for the first 12 plates performed were calculated and taken into
consideration to validate the following diagnostic plates. The same was done for QC lo
values.

Antibody titres follow a classic immune response pattern
To determine antibody responses accurately, we performed serum titrations using RBD
protein to assay the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and IgA responses. In agreement with
earlier results, not all subjects assessed early (pre-day 7) after onset of COVID-19 or
those asymptomatic show seroconversion, but anti-RBD antibodies rise swiftly during
the first days of infection. This is the case for all three isotypes assessed. As with many
reported antibody responses, including SARS [15], the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response
follows a classic pattern with high antibody responses at the start of the immune
response (Suppl.Fig.3A-C).
In addition to early responses from healthcare workers and hospitalised patients, we
analysed 187 potential plasma donors for convalescent plasma therapy via the
Portuguese Blood and Transplantation Institute (IPST). The volunteers were
predominantly male (69%) and on average 38 years old. All were reported to be SARSCoV-2 PCR positive, on average 100 days prior to serum sample collection (Table 5).
COVID-19 symptoms varied from asymptomatic to mild and moderate. At the time of

collection, 164/187 (88%) of the potential plasma donors had readily detectable IgG antiSARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies. In line with a characteristic immune response, antibody
titres assessed in volunteers were reduced compared with titres found during the early
immune response in COVID19 patients and healthcare workers, especially IgM and IgA
(Suppl.Fig.3D-F).
Analysis of the IgM, total IgG and IgA responses confirmed a rapid and near
simultaneous response of the three isotypes tested during the first weeks o f SARS-CoV2 infection (Fig.6A-C). Antibody responses peaked around three weeks after first
symptoms, after which the circulating antibody levels reduced. IgM, IgG and IgA peaked
at days 15-21 with geometric antibody titre means of 1915, 10695 and 5212 respectively.
From the second month after disease onset IgG and IgA antibody levels remained readily
detectable in most people up to 5 months after first symptoms (Fig.6A-C, Suppl.Fig.3G).
Characteristically for an antibody response, IgM titres were low (≤1/200) in 116/163
(71%) of IgG-positive potential plasma donors (Fig.6A-C). Geometric means of IgM, IgG
and IgA titres at day 91-120 were 96, 533 and 141, respectively. Early anti-SARS-CoV2 RBD antibody levels (day 40) were higher in men, with significantly higher titres for all
three antibody isotypes, but at late time points (Day 40-150) no differences between men
and women were observed (Fig.6D-I). The increase antibody level observed in men was
not explained by the severity of COVID-19, with the overall increase in antibodies
observed independently of disease symptoms (Suppl.Fig.3H). Furthermore, stratifying
subjects within the first 40 days after COVID-19 by severity of symptoms highlighted that
increased severity correlates well with increased antibody titres at early stages (Fig.6JL).
Since titres two months after COVID19 reduced, we next determined the SARS-CoV-2
neutralisaton activity. We found neutralisation activity in all tested sera in which antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined, across 2-5 months after initial SARS-CoV-2 PCRpositive testing (Fig.6M). The level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity was found to
be proportional to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG titre determined, but not IgM or IgA
(Fig.6N, Suppl.Fig.3I-J). Collectively the data highlight that a sustained level of
antibodies circulate in the blood for at least 5 months after COVID19, which show SARSCoV-2 neutralising activity in line with the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG titres.

Discussion
For many pathogens and vaccines, antibody titres have been established over the past
decades, with accumulating detailed knowledge of average antibody responses.

However, every microorganism is different and level, neutralisation activity and longevity
of antibody responses can be different between pathogens, vaccines as well as between
individuals. Therefore, it remains important to acquire data for each novel infection,
especially those posing a threat to human health such as SARS-CoV-2. In addition, initial
antibody levels after vaccination, generally correlate well with a significantly reduced risk
of (re-)infection and pathology. Thus, the global collection of data from many different
geographic locations, patient cohorts and under different local conditions will contribute
to a holistic understanding of the new pandemic.
We explain the setup of an ELISA system in detail, as described previously [9], to
facilitate implementation in other places and comparison with published results. Although
the Spike protein used in the assay is not the only immune-reactive SARS-CoV-2 protein,
it has selected because provides additional correlative insights with respect to potential
neutralising antibodies present [3, 4, 16]. The assay was setup using samples with high,
medium and low titres and an OD of 2.0 was selected to avoid saturating signals.
Although serum samples for the assay setup were determined with the initial assays prior
to full optimisation, this did not affect their subsequent use.
We show that neither frequently used methods of viral inactivation nor the complexity of
RBD, monomeric, dimeric or a mixture of both affects antibody determination. Although
reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 is limited in blood [17], the inactivation of serum
contributes to reduced risk handling human material. Using the whole RBD fraction from
mammalian expression systems will reduce costs due to its superior yield. The higher
levels of expression using the relatively small RBD, compared with the full-length Spike
protein, makes the use of RBD more economical. We show that individual samples can
show differences in signal for either RBD or Spike and that some limited cross reactivity
is observed with both proteins. However, there is no disadvantage using RBD compared
with the full-length Spike protein, resulting in high specificity and sensitivity. Care should
be taken when using serum samples from patients with increased antibody levels. These
can be observed in allergies and autoimmune conditions, which may increase the
background signal compared with otherwise healthy controls. Most subjects who
encountered SARS-CoV-2 seroconverted, although some showed delayed kinetics. Only
a few patients did not show an IgG response that was not explained by early sampli ng
(<day 7) or an underlying condition that required the use of immunosuppressive drugs.
Most of the non-responders were asymptomatic, which may point to a very modest
immune response upon encountering a low viral load, or, since SARS-CoV-2 PCRs also
generates false-positives, these participants may not have been infected.

Within the patient cohort there were additional groups of interest. With SARS-CoV-2
being a positive stranded RNA virus, the use of anti-retroviral medication had no major
effect on antibody responses against the virus. The mode of action of these drugs are
not known to interfere with RNA viruses or antibody production. Our data show the
successful management of the eleven patients previously infected with HIV, with all of
those patients showing a robust SARS-CoV-2 antibody response after the second week
of COVID-19 symptoms, in line with previous works [18, 19]. The use of
immunomodulatory drugs had an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. This
is in line with the mode of action of these drugs, inhibiting the activation or production of
lymphocytes. Although this will inhibit the clearance of SARS-CoV-2, the use of these
immune-inhibitory drugs such as Dexamethasone could be beneficial in cases of severe
immune

response against

SARS-CoV-2,

resulting

in

cytokine

storm

and

immunopathology [20].
We and others [4] found higher antibody titres in men compared with women. This is
surprising since women on average have more B cells and produce more antibodies [21].
Higher antibody titres in men, only observed during the acute stage, correlate s well with
men showing more severe symptoms and increased fatality, as reported [22, 23]. Innate
antiviral responses, such as those mediated via toll-like receptor-7, are enhanced in
women [24], which may explain their increased resistance against SARS-CoV-2,
similarly to influenza virus [25].
In many countries implementing mitigation strategies, infection prevalence remained
modest at the time of sampling, May-June 2020, with low frequency of infection [26-29].
This increases the proportional contribution of any false positives to the result. The
ELISA assay as used, was approved by the FDA as a two-step method
(https://www.fda.gov/media/137029/download). We show that using only one protein for
a large population screen picks up some false positives (30/2571; 1.2%). Especially
when the infection rate is low, the two-step method is highly beneficial and strongly
recommended [27]. Furthermore, the introduction of an additional dilution step ensures
robustness, resulting in 1.5% (38/2571) of the staff members that seroconverted. Overall,
there were limited differences between RBD and Spike reactivity, with a few samples
responding more robustly to Spike, possibly reflecting the increased amount of epitopes
available in the larger protein.
The question of long-lasting and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a focus of
current research. We show that the initial antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 raises
the three main isotypes in close concert as previously reported for SARS as well as

SARS-CoV-2 [15, 30]. The kinetics of the response follows a well-known pattern with
antibody levels peaking around 3 weeks after symptoms and declining thereafter. Late
responses are characterised by low or sometimes undetectable levels of IgM, modest
IgA, but at least until 150 days post-PCR-positive reaction, mostly a robust IgG response.
Between days 40-150 we found 89% of previous SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive subjects
(177/199), healthcare workers and potential plasma donors, to carry antibodies, 75% of
which had medium to high titres (>300). In addition, we found that in subjects with
detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralisation activity was in accordance with the
determined IgG titre level. This is in agreement with a recent report [16]. This and the
strong correlation between RBD IgG titres and neutralising activity as well as protective
immunity [16, 31], suggests that most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have
circulating protective immunity for many months after COVID-19. In addition, recent
reports of T cell responsiveness [32-35] show a robust T cell response. Since the SARSCoV-2 response is in line with well-known and detailed studied immune responses
resulting in lymphocyte memory, it is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity,
reducing disease severity, will last for at least a few years.

Materials and methods
SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Spike protein constructs
RBD and Spike protein constructs were obtained from Dr Florian Krammer, Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA.
Production, purification of antigen recombinant proteins
Production and purification of recombinant proteins was performed at Instituto de
Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica (iBET) Oeiras, Portugal as part of the
Serology4COVID consortium as previously described by Stadlbauer et al., 2020 [12].
Briefly, Spike or RBD antigen containing His-tag is produced by transient transfection of
Expi293F™ cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with plasmids suitable for mammalian cell
expression (pCAGGS), harbouring spike gene or RBD gene, respectively. All purification
steps were performed at 4ºC. At 3 days post-transfection, cultures are centrifuged,
supernatants are collected and filtered through Sartopore MidiCaps. The clarified
supernatants are concentrated and dialysed with binding buffer by tangential flow
filtration, using 10 kDa or 30 kDa membranes, for RBD or Spike purification, respectively.
The final dialysed and concentrated sample is filtered through 0.22 μm membrane and
loaded into HisTrap HP columns, equilibrated with binding buffer. Proteins are eluted
with a linear gradient up to 500 mM Imidazole. The fractions containing Spike or RBD
are concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml using Vivaflow 200 crossflow devices. Removal of
imidazole and exchange to PBS buffer is performed by diafiltration with 10 volumes of
PBS. Protein concentration is determined by A280nm combined with the specific
extinction coefficient. The concentrated and formulated products are filtered through 0.22
μm membrane, aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ºC.
Human samples collection
Upon informed consent, blood was taken by vein puncture and two BD Vacutainer CPT
tubes of blood and one serum tube were collected per patient. For serum collection,
tubes were centrifuged at 2200 rpm, 10 min at 4 oC and upper 6 x 0.25ml of serum placed
into six cryotubes. Samples are stored in a -80oC ultra low freezer at the iMM Biobank.
Serum samples were obtained from the iMM biobank COVID-19 collection, and prepandemic control sera from two allergy collections. Patients were recruited from the
COVID-19 unit and the Allergy Department of Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar
Lisboa Norte. The COVID-19 collection and scientific use was approved by the Lisbon
Academic Medical Center Ethics Committee (Ref. n.º 155/20) as was the staff screening
(Ref. n.º 181/20). The allergy studies were approved with reference 116/13. Potential
plasma donors registered voluntarily via the IPST website. Criteria for registration were
a diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV2 followed
by two negative or one negative PCR tests 14 or 28 days prior to collection, respectively.
Medical interviews were conducted to ensure that the criteria for apheresis plasma
donation were fulfilled and that a fully recovery from COVID-19 had been achieved.
Signed informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. All data were treated
confidentially and anonymous, according to (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 (General
Data Protection Regulation). A professional obliged to confidentiality with guarantee

appropriate information security measures carried out the data collection under the terms
of the GDPR paragraph 2, article 29 Law no. 58 /2019, 8 th August.
Virus inactivation
To reduce risk from any potential residual virus in the serum, three different v irus
inactivation methods were tested: incubation for one hour at 56°C (heat inactivation),
addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 (a non-ionic surfactant), or the combination of both (H+
Tx).
Antibody measurements
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs were performed as described previously [12]. Briefly, flat
bottom 96-well plates (Immulon 4 HBX; Thermo Scientific) were coated with recombinant
protein RBD or Spike prepared in PBS at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (50 μl/well) overnight
at 4°C. Coated plates were washed with PBS-0.05%Tween (PBS-T) using a Well-wash
1x8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Aquamax200, 3x for IgG detection and 10x for IgM
analysis. Plates were blocked with 200 µl/well of 3% non-fat milk powder in PBS-1%T
for 1 hour at room temperature and then washed with PBS-T 3x or 10x, as described
previously. Serum samples were diluted in PBS-0.1%T + 1% non-fat milk powder, added
(100 µl/well) and incubated for 1-2 hours at room temperature, washed with PBS-T 3x or
10x. Hereafter several antibody isotypes, namely Total Ig, IgG, IgM and IgA anti-SARSCoV2 were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled goat anti-human
IgG+IgM+IgA (Abcam, ab102420), IgG Fc (Abcam, ab97225), IgM mu chain (Abcam,
ab97205), IgA alpha chain (Abcam, ab97215) respectively. Secondary antibodies were
diluted in PBS-0.1%T + 1% non-fat milk powder (50 µl/well) and added for 1 hour at room
temperature, washed with PBS-T 3x or 10x, and developed with TMB substrate solution
(TMB Substrate Reagent Set, BD OptEIA™, 555214), 100µl/well for 10 minutes . The
reaction was stopped with 1M sulphuric acid (50 µl/well) and optical density at 450nm
was measured via Infinite M200 (TECAN) plate reader. Each plate contained a Quality
control (QC) sample, composed of a pool of positive samples or monoclonal antibody,
tested in a high and low dilution. For material details, see methods supplement.
Neutralisation assays
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs were performed as described in detail recently [36]. SARSCoV-2 pseudo particles (pp) were a kindly provided by Dr Benhur Lee, Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA. Briefly, 24 hours prior to infection, Vero CCL81
cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded at 20,000 per well in a
96-well plate. SARS-CoV-2pp and serial dilutions of sera (1/10 in DMEM with 10% FBS,
and further 2-fold dilutions) were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Media
from Vero cells was substituted with the SARS-CoV-2pp/serum mix; plates were
spinoculated by centrifugation at 1250rpm for 1hr at 37ºC. After overnight incubation at
37ºC, culture medium was removed, and Renilla luciferase production was assessed on
Tecan 2 plate reader using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega),
according to manufacturer instructions. IC50 were determined as the last serum dilution
at which the titration curve matches inhibition equal or above of 50% of the 100% assay.
