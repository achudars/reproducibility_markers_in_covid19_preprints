Abstract
Background: novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) announced as a global pandemic in the
year 2020. With the spread of the disease, a better understanding of patient outcomes associated
with their symptoms in diverse geographic levels is vital. We aimed to analysis clinical outcomes
of COVID-19 patients by disease symptoms in Ilam province of Iran.
Methods: This is a retrospective study. Data were collected from integrated health system
records for all hospitals affiliated to Ilam University of Medical Sciences between 26 Jan 2020
and 02 May 2020. All patients with definite positive test were enrolled in this study. We used
descriptive analyses, chi-square test and binary logistic regression to analyze the data using SPSS
version 22.
Results: The mean age was 46.47±18.24 years. Of 3608 patients, 3477 (96.1%) were discharged
and 129 (3.9%) were died. 54.2% of the patients were male and were in the age group of 30-40
years old age. Cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing and fever or chills
were the most common symptoms. People with symptoms of shortness of breath, abnormal
radiographic findings of the chest, and chest pain and pressure were relatively more likely to die.
Based on the findings of binary logistic regression probability of death in people who showed
shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiographic findings and chest pain was 1.34, 1.24 and 1.32
times higher than those who did not show these symptoms, respectively.
Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that presentation of some symptoms does significantly
impact on outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Early detection of symptoms and
proper management of outcomes can reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Background
The first cases of an unknown pneumonia were reported in late December 2019 from Wuhan,
China [1]. After a while, a novel Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-COV-2), was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently named novel
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2]. A few
months after the onset of the disease, the WHO on 11 March 2020 has declared the disease
outbreak a global pandemic [3]. More than 49 million cases worldwide and 600,000 cases in Iran
have been reported so far, of which more than 1 million deaths have been recorded in the world,
which is a significant statistic compared to previous pandemics [4, 5]. To date (11.07.2020),
according to statistics, Iran ranks as 14th in terms of the number of cases and the 9th country in
terms of the number of deaths due to COVID-19 [5]. Considering the specific features of this
disease and its increasing trend in the world and especially in Iran, identifying the
epidemiological characteristics of patients and their clinical features is very important in making
appropriate decisions that can ultimately help control the epidemic [6]. Main features of COVID19 have been previously reported [7, 8], but it is also important to look at the characteristics of
individuals in certain populations. The epidemiological characteristics of patients in a particular
region can be different from other parts of the world, so knowledge of these epidemiological and
clinical characteristics can be useful to local authorities to provide the necessary facilities and to
decide on disease control [9-11]. Then, this study aimed to evaluate the disease outcome in
COVID-19 infected patients by disease symptoms in Ilam province, west of Iran.

Methods
Study design, patients and data collection

The present study is a retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were collected at the
all hospitals that affiliated to Ilam University of Medical Sciences. All suspected individuals who
have been referred to and tested for COVID-19 and his/her information registered in integrated
health system records of Iran called SIB and related to Ilam provinces, between 26 Jan 2020 and
02 May 2020 with definite positive test were enrolled in this study. The proposal was approved
by

the

ethics

committee

of

Ilam

University

of

Medical

Sciences

(No.

IR.MEDILAM.REC.1399.043). The extracted information were as follows: gender, age, national
code, date of admission and hospitalization, sign and symptoms, contact history, type of
comorbidities, test results, and final outcome. Positive cases of COVID-19 were confirmed by
SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were
collected at the 4 hospitals that provided care for these patients. All extracted information is kept
confidential.
Statistical analysis

Retrieved data were recorded into MicrosoftExcel (version 13) and analyzed. The SPSS version
22.0 (SPSS 22.0; SPSSInc, Chicago, IL, USA) were used. Two researchers independently
reviewed the collected data for accuracy. Descriptive analyses of the variables were conducted as
mean (Mean±SD) or number (%). Chi-square test was used to evaluate the effect of demographic
variables (age, sex, etc.) and underlying diseases / symptoms on the outcome of the infected
patients. Also, the cumulative effect of all independent variables on disease outcome was
investigated using binary logistic regression.

According to the results of Chi-square and Fisher's Exact Test, people with symptoms of
shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiograph findings, and chest pain and pressure are
relatively more likely to die. On the other hand, people with symptoms of sore throat, headache,
diarrhea, contusions, and muscle pain were relatively less likely to die (Table 3).
The results of the binary logistic regression model also confirmed the above findings.
Accordingly, shortness of breath, abnormal chest radiograph findings, and chest pressure and
pain predict the outcome of death in patients. Patients who showed symptoms of shortness of
breath, abnormal findings on chest radiography, and chest pain and pressure were more likely to
die than those who did not show these symptoms (1.34, 1.24, and 1.32, respectively) (Table 4).

Discussion
In the present study, which was designed to evaluate the outcome of the disease in patients with
COVID-19 according to the symptoms of the disease, it was found that from January to May
2020 in Ilam province in western Iran, 3608 definitive cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed.
Of these, 3.9% had died of the disease. Studies around the world show a significant increase in
COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide [12]. A study conducted in southern Iran showed that
COVID-19 mortality was about 8% [13], and a meta-analysis study showed that overall COVID19 mortality was about 5%. [14], which shows a higher percentage than the results of the present
study. It seems that the differences in the demographic characteristics of the patients as well as
the severity of the disease of the patients participating in the studies have led to the reporting of
different percentages of disease mortality.

In the present study, the majority of infected cases were men.Women appear to be less
susceptible to viral infections because of their protection against the X chromosome and sex
hormones that play a key role in their innate immunity [15]. Also, the age group of 30-40 years
had the highest frequency of infected cases. A similar study in Iran showed that the age group of
50-60 years has the highest incidence of COVID-19, while the highest fatality rate of the disease
with 19.27 and 14.85% is related to age groups with more than 70 years [6]. It seems that with
increasing age, the probability of death due to COVID-19 also increases. As in the study of Zhou
et al., It was found that patients who died due to COVID-19 had a significantly higher mean age
(about 69 years) than those people who survived [16].
The results of logistic regression model in the present study showed that symptoms such as
shortness of breath, pain and pressure of chest, abnormal findings of chest radiography and sore
throat are the most important factors in predicting the outcome of death in patients with COVID19.According to the results of this study, people who had a higher percentage of shortness of
breath, chest pain and pressure, and abnormal chest radiographic findings were more likely to die
than other patients. However, in terms of other symptoms of the disease, no significant
difference was observed between the two groups (dead or survived).The study by Chang et al.
showed that symptoms such as fever and chills significantly contribute to the progression of the
disease to its severe stage [17]. Another study by Lian et al. showed that patients over 60 years of
age and shortness of breath were significantly more likely to develop the more severe clinical
form of COVID-19 than other patients [18]. Another similar study found that 100% of patients
with COVID-19 whose lungs were damaged were died [19].The study by Li et al. showed that
the prevalence of symptoms such as cough, sputum, chest pain, and shortness of breath in
patients with severe or acute COVID-19 was significantly higher than in normal patients. This

study found that patients with severe disease had a CT scan score higher than 7 compared to
patients with normal condition [20]. On the other hand, a review study by GalloMarin et al.
showed that hypoxia and specific CT scan findings indicate extensive lung involvement, with
increased disease severity or death [14].Chest imaging results in one study showed that the
presence of pulmonary fibrosis and older age was associated with increased patient transfer to
the intensive care unit (ICU) [21]. However, in the study of Guan et al., It was found that 20.1%
of all patients with COVID-19 who had a positive RT-PCR test and also had symptoms of the
disease were normal in terms of chest CT scan [7]. It is therefore important to note that CT scan
alone cannot be a diagnostic criterion for COVID-19 [22].
Another study by Chen et al. Showed that fever and shortness of breath were significantly higher
in patients who died of COVID-19 than in the survived group [23]. Another similar study found
that the prevalence of symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue, muscle pain
and dizziness was higher in patients with severe or critical COVID-19.Also, only in terms of
shortness of breath, there was a significant difference between the group that died and the group
that survived. The percentage of shortness of breath in the group that died of COVID-19 was
significantly higher than the other group [24].
Conclusion
The results of the present study showed that symptoms such as shortness of breath, pain and
pressure of chest, abnormal findings of chest radiography and sore throat are the most predictors
of the outcome of death in patients with COVID-19. Patients who had a higher percentage of
shortness of breath, chest pain and pressure, and abnormal chest radiographic findings were more
likely to die than other patients.
