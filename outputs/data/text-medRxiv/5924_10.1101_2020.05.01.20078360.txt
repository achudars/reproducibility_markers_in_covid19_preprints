tocilizumab group.
• The former group may be the best for evaluating the impact of anti-cytokine therapy in COVID19.
• The known poor risk factors for COVID-19 infection were present in the TOCI treated rather
than in the good prognosis standard of care group.

Abstract [250 words]

45

Objective

46

Approximately 5% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a life-

47

threatening pneumonia that often occurs in the setting of increased inflammation or “cytokine

48

storm”. Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear,

49

and the aim of our study is to address this point.

50

Methods

51

Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19

52

pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two

53

groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6

54

levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care

55

patients (SOC).

56

Results

57

In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI,

58

62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8±10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26

59

cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection.

60

One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious

61

bacterial superinfection.

62

complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p<0.0001 for both)

63

and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p= 0.04 and p=0.001, respectively) with the

64

TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.

65

Conclusion

66

Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI

67

cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy

68

time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.

Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial

Introduction

75

The outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

76

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic [1]. About twenty-five percent of patients have

77

a seriously ill disease. A fraction of them may develop a very severe pneumonia which may

78

progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure that may be associated

79

with a cytokine storm syndrome [2]. Laboratory features associated with ARDS or death included

80

neutrophilia, coagulation dysfunction [e.g., higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer] [3].

81

Markedly high levels of interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α and the absolute numbers of

82

CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes being markedly low seem to characterize the most severe cases

83

[4]. Starting from the first preliminary experience on the apparent efficacy of tocilizumab in

84

COVID-19 pneumonia [5], many multicenter trials are ongoing to test anti-cytokine treatments in

85

critically ill patients.

86
87

Nevertheless, robust data to predict the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia after the hospital

88

admission are still lacking [6], though they are urgently needed in order to facilitate the assessment

89

of anti-cytokine treatment efficacy in worse prognosis patient groups and not milder disease. The

90

aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate baseline laboratory and immunological features in

91

patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and to explore such parameters in relationship to

92

standard of care (SOC group) therapy versus anti-cytokine therapy, mainly tocilizumab, (TOCI

93

group) that was mostly used either in ventilated patients in the ICU or non-invasively ventilated

94

patients, mostly in the ward setting. Our single centre experience and approach showed that the

95

milder hospitalized SOC group faired well as did cases with cytokine storm treated with

96

tocilizumab outside of the ICU setting without ventilator support. Severe complications including

97

bacterial infections complicated tocilizumab in the ICU setting but not ward-based tocilizumab

98

therapy. Therefore, randomized trials should target non-ICU patients to prevent cytokine storm

99

evolution.

101

Methods

102

This study was undertaken to identify laboratory features for more serious COVID-19 disease (i.e.,

103

to determine which cases that might theoretically benefit from anti-cytokine drugs). In this

104

monocentric retrospective case-control study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 111

105

consecutive patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. Patients were admitted to our hospital from

106

February 29 to April 6, 2020. All but 6 patients presented to our hospital with 6 cases transferred

107

from three other hospitals (all of whom eventually received tocilizumab).

108
109

Oral or written consent was obtained from patients. The study was conducted in accordance with

110

the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration and ethical approval was given by local Ethics

111

Committee (CEUR-2020-Os-102).

112
113

Besides clinical evaluation, the level of CRP and IL-6, when available, guided the decision towards

114

anti-cytokine treatments. Clinical decisions for the treatment of all these patients were taken usually

115

within the first week after the admission, and during this time, the laboratory tests were repeated.

116

Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments and outcome data were collected.

117

Identification of cases of COVID-19 virus was based on the detection of unique sequences of virus

118

RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as RT-PCR with confirmation by nucleic

119

acid sequencing. The following genes were investigated: E gene for screening and then RdRp and N

120

genes of SARS-CoV-2 for confirmation [7].

121
122

Some laboratory data analysed at the admission are reported in table 1, including flow cytometry

123

analysis with antibodies for the following subpopulations: CD19+ B cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells,

124

CD3+CD8+ T cells, CD56+ NK cells, platelet count (cell/microL) and serum IL-6 (pg/ml),

measured by CE_IVD electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys IL6, Cobas, physiological

126

range < 7pg/ml) with results being available within 48 hours.

127
128

Variables were reported as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range (IQR), as

129

appropriate, or frequency rates and percentages if categorical; consequently, comparisons between

130

TOCI and SOC groups were made by parametric tests (t-test for two independent samples) or no

131

parametric tests (Mann-Whitney test) for continuous variables. Proportions were compared by χ2

132

test, or Fisher exact test. Bivariate correlation was made by two tailed Pearson or Spearman tests.

133

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 software (SPSS Inc). For

134

unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided α of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. No

135

corrections were made for multiple comparisons due to the explorative nature of the study.

136
137

When the laboratory parameters were available, the patients were classified into two groups: the

138

first group comprised 42 cases who developed a serious COVID-19 disease that were deemed

139

suitable for tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously as a single infusion. In TOCI failures, two patients

140

were then treated with anakinra 200 mg/day subcutaneously for three consecutive days. A second

141

group of 69 cases who received supportive therapy [standard of care group (SOC)] comprised those

142

initially admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, and who were treated with SOC based on clinical

143

and laboratory features (Table 1).

Patients’ characteristics and outcome

147

Table 1 reports the main demographic and clinical features of the two groups. Patients were

148

predominantly male (77/111, 69.4%) with a mean age of 58.5±13.6 years. Patients in TOCI were

149

slightly older than SOC (p=0.02) (table 1). Globally, at the hospital admission, resting oxygen

150

saturation equal or below 93% was available for 45 patients (40.5%).

151
152

Antiviral treatments were employed in 100% of TOCI group and 80% of SOC group (Table 1).

153

Notably, nearly 40% of TOCI group received glucocorticoids but none of the SOC group did (Table

154

1). There was no difference between groups regarding the time of reaching a negative swab test

155

(supplemental file).

156
157

Among TOCI group, 18 (43%) patients were originally referred to the Infectious Disease Unit with

158

3 being subsequently transferred to ICU before tocilizumab administration (Figure 1) with 24/42

159

patients (57%) ICU transfers within 24 hours of hospital admission. The majority of patients

160

received tocilizumab in the ICU (27/42, 64.3%) with the remaining 15 cases receiving TOCI on the

161

ward. Tocilizumab was administered after a mean time of 8.4±3.7 days from disease onset as add-

162

on treatment. Of the 27 patients that were transferred to ICU, 26 (96.3%) were intubated with

163

subsequent tracheostomies in 8 (7.2%), while only one was on noninvasive ventilation.

164
165

There were no fatalities in the SOC group (Figure 1). Overall, at April 18, 2020, 4/42 TOCI patients

166

had died (9.5%). Of the TOCI ventilated patients 15/26 (57.7%) had a good outcome. When

167

combined with fatality rate, 11/26 (42.3%) patients in the TOCI ventilated group can be deemed as

168

non-responders. By contrast, 15/16 (93.7%) TOCI non-ventilated patients can be deemed as

169

responders with a single fatality (Figure 1). Importantly, at the hospital admission, TOCI patients

170

who required invasive ventilation showed higher levels of inflammation markers, higher LDH and

171

lower lymphocyte count than non-ventilated TOCI patients (Table 2).

172

Eighteen out 111 patients (16.2%) experienced bacterial superinfection that were almost exclusively

173

in the TOCI group (Figure 1). Three out of four deaths and 17/18 bacterial complications occurred

174

in ICU (all 3 deaths as well as all the bacterial complications occurred in patients on ventilators or

175

in the non-ventilated TOCI group (Figure 1).

177

While all the patients in the SOC group recovered, in the TOCI group, 9/42 (21.4%) patients

178

completely recovered, and 21/42 (50%) patients showed a clear and rapid improvement after

179

tocilizumab. A rapid improvement on anakinra after tocilizumab occurred in one case. In the 21

180

recovered TOCI treated group complicating infections arose in 11 (52.4%). In the remaining 12

181

non-responder patients, four of them died, including one treated with anakinra after tocilizumab

182

failure, and almost all showed co-morbidities including hypertension, obesity, ischemic heart

183

disease or diabetes, or experienced superinfections, which substantially complicated the course.

184
185

Retrospective laboratory marker comparison between treatment groups

186

At hospital admission, TOCI group showed a significantly higher level of systemic inflammation as

187

resulted by the significant difference of CRP levels [mg/L, median (IQR)] [79.05 (47.8-186.22) vs

188

24.1 (7.3-72.6) p<0.0001)], and IL-6 levels [pg/mL, median (IQR)] [63.5 (37.25-135.5) vs 18.5

189

(10.25-33), p<0.0001]. Also, some other laboratory features mirrored a higher level of systemic

190

disease and organ damage in TOCI group, such as LDH [IU/L, median (IQR)] [625 (482-829) vs

191

442 (375-577), p=0.001] and CK [IU/L, median (IQR)] [134 (84.5-365.5) vs 93 (57-146), p=0.007].

192
193

The TOCI group showed a significantly higher neutrophil count (cells/microL) [4565 (3062.5-6190)

194

vs 3670 (2285-4905), p=0.04], lower lymphocyte count [cell/microL, median (IQR)] [685 (545-

195

1022.5) vs 940 (760-1195), p=0.001], CD4+ T cell [244.5 (158.75-406.25) vs 370 (269.5-497),

196

p=0.02], CD8+ T cell subpopulation [77 (48-195.75) vs 180 (111-366), p=0.004]. Also, neutrophil

197

to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in TOCI group than in SOC group [5.6 (3.5-

198

11.8) vs 3.6 (2.2-5.4), p=0.001]. The TOCI group also showed basal higher levels of LDH

199

(p=0.001) and CK (p=0.007), possibly indicating cardiac injury that is a known bad prognostic sign.

whole population (TOCI+SOC) and in the whole population after excluding those patients with the

203

worst clinical presentation at the admission (N=24). A moderate to high correlation (>0.5) was

204

found between CRP and the following variables: D-dimer, LDH, neutrophil count and NLR (table

205

2).

206

By excluding those patients admitted to the ICU within 24 hours (i.e., the most serious) (table 3B),

207

CRP and IL-6 remained statistically significant as discriminant variables between the two groups

208

(Table 3). Yet, correlations between CRP and IL-6, total white blood cell count, neutrophil count,

209

NLR, LDH were still significant (table 3B).

210

Furthermore, the same analysis in the whole cohort by splitting the two group (N=42 for TOCI and

211

N=69 for SOC), showed that baseline CRP value correlated with IL-6, D-dimer, LDH, WBC,

212

neutrophil count and NLR only in the SOC group, while in the TOCI group, baseline CRP

213

correlated only with LDH, WBC, neutrophil and NLR (data not shown).

214
215

Discussion

216
217

Our retrospective study was designed to evaluate which baseline standardized laboratory features in

218

hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia may facilitate optimal employment of experimental anti-

219

cytokine therapy [8, 9]. Some case reports and one case series on the treatment with tocilizumab

220

have been reported in the literature, suggesting some benefits in seriously ill patients [10-16]. More

221

clearly, our data suggested that tocilizumab treatment in patients with cytokine storm features may

222

be more effective outside of the ICU setting in non-ventilated patients. However, there were

223

differences in the degree of inflammation between non-ventilated and ventilated patients treated

224

with tocilizumab, so it cannot be inferred that use of tocilizumab prior to ICU admission is superior,

225

given the generally milder inflammation in the former group. Also, serious superimposed bacterial

226

infections were largely confined to the ICU. More worryingly, half the ICU ventilated patients

227

treated with TOCI remain ventilated or have died with only half of this group showing meaningful

228

clinical improvement so far.

229
230

Our findings confirmed that the milder patient group receiving standard of care therapy without the

231

utilization of tocilizumab all made full recoveries. Our findings do point towards trials focused on

232

the earlier use of such therapeutic strategies. Notably, our SOC and TOCI groups were different in

233

terms of co-treatments, which could have affected the overall outcome, and all of the TOCI cases

234

also received antiviral therapy. These findings are preliminary and the results of ongoing

235

randomized controlled trials will definitely clarify anti-cytokine use.

236
237

In our study, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, in particular low CD8+ T cell count rather than CD4+ T

238

cell, higher CRP, higher LDH and higher CK showed the highest significance to distinguish the two

239

patient groups at initial hospital admission. Also, serum IL-6 was significantly higher in the TOCI

240

group, thus reflecting the very high inflammatory state of those patients at baseline. Very recently,

241

IL-6 serum levels were also closely correlated with viral load in critically ill patients and it is

242

important to point out that all our patients belonging to TOCI group received anti-viral agents [17].

243

Notably, baseline CRP and IL-6 continued to distinguish the two groups (TOCI versus SOC) even

244

after excluding the most seriously ill patients from analyses. Thus, these biomarkers could useful

245

for decision making. Notably, a higher NLR, as well as a higher monocyte to lymphocyte ratio,

246

have been associated with mortality and imaging progression in hospitalized patients for COVID-19

247

[18-20]. It is well known that NLR is a biomarker for poor outcome even in various cancers [21].

248
249

Lymphocyte biology probably plays a great role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease [4, 22-

250

25].

251

Since CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are a crucial arm against infections [26], our findings also

252

indicated that the lymphopenia in the TOCI group may be relevant for secondary infections. Given

253

that, treatment with tocilizumab might favor the persistence of the virus and iatrogenic infections.

254

Anakinra might be safer and more flexible than repeating tocilizumab infusion in seriously ill

255

patients.

256
257

A role for anticoagulation is increasingly recognized in severe COVID-19 [27, 28]. In our study, a

258

significant correlation between CRP and D-dimer, as well as with LDH and neutrophil count (and

259

NLR) was shown. Very recent data showed that low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated

260

heparin at prophylactic doses are associated with a reduced short-term mortality in more severe

261

COVID-19 patients [28], and most of our patients, particularly, in ICU, were administered heparin

262

which may have impacted on the overall outcome. Moreover, inflammatory diseases carry a higher

263

risk of thrombosis, as seen in chronic autoimmune diseases [29]. It remains to be seen whether the

264

possible efficacy of anti-cytokine therapy may be even to mitigate against immunothrombosis.

265

Increased levels of LDH and CK may also reflect the level of the organ damage in a systemic

266

disease, as occurs in the macrophage activation syndrome [30], where a hypercoagulable state often

267

complicates the course, and it may be the case for COVID-19. Thus, it is not surprisingly that LDH

268

has been already noticed as biomarker of severity as long as neutrophils, in COVID-19 [3, 31].

270

This study has several limitations. It is a retrospective study, with some missing data due to the

271

emergency context in which it has been realized. No conclusions on the efficacy and safety of

272

treatment approach employed can be provided. Six patients were transferred from other hospitals so

273

original baseline values from the first admission were unavailable. About 50% of the TOCI group

274

were admitted to the ICU within 24 hours from admission, thus they already presented a more

275

serious disease at the time of admission. The follow-up was limited from our hospital admission to

276

discharge. Finally, measurement of viral load was not available. Nevertheless, the cohort is

277

monocentric and it showed similar characteristics to those reported by Wang et al. [2], thus

278

supporting the results, though preliminary.

280

To conclude, our study showed that TOCI treated patients COVID-19 pneumonia were at the

281

highest risk of cytokine storm [32]. Tocilizumab use prior to ventilation in ICU may be optimal

282

since 50% of such cases died, remain ventilated and show serious superinfection. Whether the use

283

of tocilizumab prior to ventilation will be vindicated in randomized trials is of major interest. Our

284

findings also showed that cases receiving tocilizumab on ventilation generally had higher levels of

285

inflammation than non-ventilated TOCI treated subjects, possibly suggesting that the latter group

286

has an intrinsically milder disease with a better prognosis. Timing of anti-cytokine therapy is a key

287

issue.
