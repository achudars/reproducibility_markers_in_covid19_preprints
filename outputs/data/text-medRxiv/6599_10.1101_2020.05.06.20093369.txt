Abstract
Contact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only “forward-trace” to
notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we show
that “bidirectional” tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly
improves outbreak control, reducing the effective reproduction number (​Reff​
​ ) by at least ~0.3 while
dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. Adding
smartphone-based exposure notification can further reduce ​Reff
​ by 0.25, but only if nearly all
smartphones can detect exposure events. ​Our results suggest that with or without digital
approaches, implementing bidirectional tracing will enable health agencies to control COVID-19
more effectively without requiring high-cost interventions.

Introduction
Contact tracing, isolation, and testing are some of the most powerful public health interventions available.
The nations that have most effectively controlled the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are noteworthy for
conducting comprehensive and sophisticated tracing and testing​1​. Current “forward-tracing” protocols
seek to identify and isolate individuals who may have been infected by the known case, preventing
continued transmission (Fig. 1a). For example, the European Union and World Health Organization call
for the identification of contacts starting two days prior to the development of symptoms​2,3​.
However, chains of SARS-CoV-2 transmission may persist despite excellent medical monitoring and
forward-tracing programs due to substantial rates of undiagnosed or asymptomatic transmission​4 (Fig. 1a).
Asymptomatic carriers, who reportedly bear equivalent viral loads to patients exhibiting symptoms​5​, have
been estimated to account for 18%​6 to 79%​7 of cases, with multiple population surveys indicating
intermediate values around 45%​8–10​.
We hypothesized that when asymptomatic carriers are common, “bidirectional” contact tracing could
identify and isolate undiscovered branches of the transmission tree, preventing many additional cases
(Fig. 1b). Bidirectional contact tracing uses “reverse-tracing” to identify the parent case who infected a
known case, then continues tracing to iteratively discover other cases related to the parent. It has been
successfully used to identify clusters and community transmission in Japan​12 and Singapore​13,14​, but is

otherwise uncommon. Because the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2 is longer than 48 hours, existing
tracing protocols cannot identify parent cases​2,3​, and previous studies of COVID-19 contact tracing have
neglected the possibility of gains from bidirectional tracing.
Numerous ongoing efforts aim to use smartphones emitting randomized Bluetooth and/or ultrasound
“chirps” to notify people exposed to infected individuals (Fig. 1d–e). Digital approaches may offer
considerable advantages in speed​15​, scale, efficacy​4​, and confidentiality​16​. To investigate the efficacy of
bidirectional tracing, we adapted and extended a stochastic branching-process model of SARS-CoV-2
forward-tracing​17 and used it to explore the efficacy of different tracing strategies under plausible
epidemiological scenarios.

exposed to known cases (black) and isolating them (green) can prevent further transmission, but will miss asymptomatic
and undiagnosed cases (gray) and descendants. (b) Bidirectional tracing also notifies and tests potential infectors,

broadcasted chirps to a diagnosis server​11​. All devices frequently check the server and alert the user if calculated
exposure exceeds a threshold set by the local health authority. In hybrid manual+digital systems, human tracers would
seek to identify contacts without smartphones.

Results
Bidirectional tracing improves epidemic control in manual and idealized digital scenarios
In our model, each case generates a number of new cases drawn from a negative binomial distribution,
with incubation and generation-time distributions based on the published literature (Table 1 & Table S1).
Cases could be identified and isolated based on symptoms alone or through contact tracing (Methods).
Each outbreak was initialized with 20 index cases to minimize stochastic extinction, and designated as
“controlled” if it reached extinction (zero new cases) before reaching 10,000 cumulative cases.
We began by investigating a median scenario in which 10% of transmission was assumed to be
environmental (and therefore untraceable), 48% of transmission occurred pre-symptomatically, and 45%
of cases were asymptomatic with reduced (50%) infectiousness. For the initial analysis we assumed a
fixed basic reproduction number (​R​0​) of 2.5 (Fig. 2), but explored other ​R​0​ values below.

In this scenario, manual forward tracing of contacts occurring up to 48 hours before symptom onset per
current guidelines​2​ reduced ​R​eff​ as anticipated, but not nearly enough to control the pandemic without
other measures: even if all non-environmental contacts within that time window were successfully traced,
Reff​
​ remained in excess of 1.4 (Fig. 2a). Extending the tracing window to 7 days before symptom onset
yielded a moderate improvement, reducing the best-case ​R​eff​ by roughly 0.2 (Fig. 2a and Fig. S1); further
widening of the tracing window resulted in minimal additional benefit (Fig. S2). Switching from
forward-only to bidirectional tracing offered a further gain of similar magnitude, bringing the best-case
Reff​
​ close to the critical threshold of 1.0. Even here, however, the fraction of outbreaks controlled was less
than 50% (Fig. 2e).
Compared to manual tracing, digital exposure notification is both faster and scalable to much wider time
windows. When all contacts in the past 14 days were available for analysis​11​, idealized digital
forward-tracing produced markedly superior outcomes relative to manual forward-tracing (Fig. 2b), in
agreement with earlier models​4​. Crucially, bidirectional digital tracing exhibited an even more dramatic
improvement over the forward-only approach, successfully bringing ​Reff​
​ below 1.0 without any other
control measures (Fig. 2b) and more than doubling the best-case probability of control (Fig. S5).
Digital tracing is fragile to network fragmentation
Idealized digital contact tracing appears promising, but assumes all individuals carry exposure-detecting
smartphones and upload their broadcasted chirps when diagnosed with COVID-19. We hypothesized that
the effectiveness of digital tracing would rapidly degrade when fewer people participated, in line with or
worse than the quadratic dependence noted by others​4,16,18​.
As predicted, even small decreases in the proportion of individuals carrying a participating smartphone or
(to a lesser extent) sharing their broadcasted chirps resulted in fragmentation of the tracing network (Fig.
2c, and Fig. S3 & S6), increasing ​Reff​
​ to levels comparable to, or even worse than, manual tracing alone.
As a consequence of this fragility, our results suggest that digital tracing alone cannot currently substitute
for traditional manual tracing, even under very optimistic assumptions about uptake and use​19,20​.
Hybridizing manual and digital tracing improves performance
Neither manual nor digital contact tracing alone sufficed to control COVID-19 in our median scenario.
Digital tracing is fast and comprehensive but highly fragile to network fragmentation; manual tracing is
slower and limited to a narrow time window, but more robust. We hypothesized that the two methods
could complement each other, with manual contact tracers focusing their effort on tracing contacts
invisible to the digital system, and that this hybrid approach might outperform either method in isolation.
When 80% of cases participated in the digital system, supplementing bidirectional manual with digital
tracing substantially improved epidemic control (Fig. 2d), reducing best-case ​R​eff​ by roughly 0.15
compared to manual tracing and more than 0.5 compared to digital tracing with equivalent uptake.
Compared to manual tracing, a hybrid approach roughly doubled the probability of controlling individual
outbreaks (Fig. 2e). Control under hybrid tracing was still somewhat sensitive to uptake of the digital

system (Fig. 2f); but far less so than digital tracing alone. Performing only forward-tracing, or reducing
the width of the manual tracing window, substantially degraded performance (Fig. 2d–e & Figs. S3–S7).

Bidirectional tracing is robust to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity
Our results thus far assume that 90% of symptomatic cases can be identified based on symptoms alone,
corresponding to an overall ascertainment rate (including asymptomatic cases) of roughly 50%.
Unsurprisingly, reducing the percentage of symptomatic cases so identified impaired epidemic control
(Fig. 3a & Fig. S31). However, bidirectional tracing was far more robust to these changes than
forward-only tracing, resulting in dramatically lower R​eff values across a wide range of ascertainment
rates.
When symptomatic cases can be traced immediately based on symptoms alone (our default assumption), ,
both forward-only and bidirectional tracing were fairly robust to deviations in test sensitivity from our
default assumption of 80%, with ​R​eff​ values increasing only slowly as sensitivity falls (Fig. 3b). In
contrast, if a positive test result was required before tracing from symptomatic cases (as is the case in
many countries​21​), the efficacy of forward-tracing became dramatically more dependent on a high test
sensitivity: low sensitivities yielded greatly increased R​eff​ values (Fig. 3c & Fig. S30), consistent with
previous modeling studies reporting impaired performance under these conditions​21​. In sharp contrast, the
performance of bidirectional tracing remained relatively robust to changes in test sensitivity even under
these conditions.

tracing window, high-uptake digital tracing, and median disease parameters (Table S1). In (a-b), tracing can be initiated
from symptomatic cases without a test, while in (c) a positive test result is required; in both cases, a positive test result
is required to initiate tracing from pre- or asymptomatic cases. (a) assumes test sensitivity of 80%, while (b-c) assume
90% of symptomatic cases are identified on the basis of symptoms. “Probability of trace success” refers to trace
attempts that are not otherwise blocked by environmental transmission or fragmentation of the digital network.

High-uptake hybrid bidirectional tracing robustly doubles the probability of outbreak control
To evaluate the epidemiological robustness of our findings, we repeated our analysis using ​R0​ ​values
ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 (Fig. 4, left)​4,9,22–24​. We assumed tracing of 90% of non-environmental contacts, a
7-day manual trace window, immediate tracing of symptomatic cases, and high uptake of the digital
system. A wider range of assumptions are explored in Figures S9–S31.
Small reductions in ​R​0​ resulted in large increases in control probability across all forms of tracing (Fig. 4,
left). Hybrid bidirectional tracing robustly outperformed all other tracing strategies, with the greatest
degree of outperformance observed when 1.75 ≤ ​R0​​ ≤ 3.5. When ​R0​​ ≤ 1.75, manual and hybrid tracing
both achieved nearly 100% control, while when ​R0​ ≥
​ 3.5, no strategy achieved control probabilities over
10%. Even in these low-control scenarios, however, hybrid bidirectional tracing consistently reduced R​eff
by roughly 20% relative to manual tracing alone (Fig. 4 & Figs. S19–S20, S22, S32). Constraining
manual tracing to a 2- rather than 7-day window substantially impaired performance (Fig. S10), while
lowering uptake of the digital system from 80% to 53% of cases – in line with existing survey data​19–21
and current plans for opt-in participation​11​ – mostly abrogated the advantage of hybrid over manual
approaches (Figs. S16 and S21–S22).

under a uniform beta prior; points in the bottom row represent average values over the same. Isolating symptomatic cases
can dampen the outbreak at low ​R0​​ , even in the absence of tracing.

While COVID-19 is clearly a challenging disease to control, there remains substantial uncertainty around
the exact rates of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and environmental transmission. To explore a wider
range of scenarios, we aggregated our collective best estimates to define optimistic and pessimistic values
for these parameters, with 5/15% environmental transmission, 38/53% pre-symptomatic transmission, and
40/55% asymptomatic carriers which were 45/60% as infectious as symptomatic cases. We repeated our
simulations under these new assumptions for a range of ​R0​​ values (Fig. 4, middle & right).
While hybrid bidirectional tracing continued to robustly outperform other configurations (Figs. S17-S22),
the probability of control varied substantially between scenarios: in the optimistic scenario, high-uptake
hybrid bidirectional tracing was sufficient to reliably control outbreaks whenever ​R​0 ≤ 2.5, while in the
pessimistic scenario reliable control was only achieved at ​R0​ ≤ 1.75. Restricting uptake of the digital
system or the width of the manual tracing window impaired performance across all scenarios (Figs. S10 &
S16-S22).
To summarize the predicted effects of different approaches, we compared the percentage of outbreaks
controlled and ​Reff
​ values achieved under all three scenarios, in the absence of any other interventions
(Fig. 5, & Figs. S33–S36). Relative to optimal current practice (i.e. 2-day forward-only manual tracing),
7-day bidirectional manual tracing achieved a reduction in ​R​eff of roughly 0.3 across all scenarios.
Supplementing manual tracing with a low-uptake digital system provided a further reduction of 0.1 in the
median and pessimistic scenarios, increasing to 0.25 (i.e., 0.55 total) when uptake was high. In total,
switching from current practice to high-uptake hybrid bidirectional tracing approximately tripled the
probability of controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across all three scenarios.
Discussion
Given the tremendous suffering inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the potentially critical role of
expanding contact-tracing systems in its control, there is an urgent need to optimize the implementation of
these systems.
Our model predicts that making tracing bidirectional would markedly improve COVID-19 control.
Indeed, for a contact-tracing system to reach the levels of control cited by earlier studies​4,21​, we find that
bidirectional tracing is ​required​. Bidirectional tracing outperforms forward-tracing regardless of how the
tracing is done. Simply switching to manual bidirectional tracing is sufficient to reduce ​Reff
​ by 0.3 if the
time window for tracing is sufficiently wide, while high-uptake bidirectional hybrid tracing is predicted to
be approximately three times as effective at controlling outbreaks as current best practice. The case for
bidirectional tracing becomes even stronger when case ascertainment is otherwise suboptimal, or if a
positive test result is required before tracing the contacts of a symptomatic case.

in most regions. Low and high uptake correspond to 53% and 80% of cases, respectively, having chirp-enabled
smartphones. Error bars in the top row represent 95% credible intervals across 1000 runs under a uniform beta prior.
Without tracing, forward and bidirectional are equivalent.

We stress-tested these conclusions with a wide range of plausible parameter combinations and possible
values of ​R​0​. Notably, our “optimistic” scenario is more pessimistic than some earlier studies due to recent
studies reporting higher values for both the rate and relative infectiousness of asymptomatic
carriers​5,9,23,25,26​. Whether hybrid bidirectional tracing alone was sufficient to reliably control the pandemic
was dependent on epidemiological parameters; however, if other low-cost precautions​27 could reduce ​R​eff
below 1.75, our model predicts that this strategy would bring transmission under control with high
probability even under our pessimistic scenario.
Despite this stress-testing, our conclusions must be considered in the context of our model, which, while
less idealized than its predecessors, has limitations. It makes no distinction between mild and severe
symptoms, and does not consider demographic, geospatial or behavioural variation between cases. Since
only true cases are included in the model, only the sensitivity of testing is considered; in reality, the

balance between test sensitivity and specificity is a crucial trade-off, and high rates of false positives will
severely impede response effectiveness and the credibility of the tracing system.
These limitations aside, there is considerable evidence that bidirectional tracing can be feasibly
implemented in practice. Locales such as Singapore​13,14 and Washington State​28 have employed
bidirectional tracing to determine whether community transmission is occurring, while Japan’s protocol
explicitly aims to identify sources of infection​12​. The primary practical difference between contact with an
infector and an infectee is the time at which the contact occurred; as such, the core obstacle to
implementation in other areas is the cost of expanding the tracing window. Health authorities could
accomplish this by expanding the workforce of contact tracers, leveraging the lightened workload
afforded by a high-uptake digital system, or focusing limited resources on clusters as is done in Japan.
Digital systems, which already track exposures for 14 days, can trace bidirectionally at no additional cost.
In addition to effective implementation of bidirectional tracing, a successful control program will also
depend on the availability of timely COVID-19 testing​15​, high adherence to quarantine requests​4,17,29,30​,
and scaling of manual contact tracing, while digital systems will require efficient algorithms with
acceptable sensitivity and specificity. These caveats notwithstanding, our results indicate that
bidirectional contact tracing could play an essential and potentially decisive role in controlling COVID-19
and preventing future pandemics.

Methods
Structure of the model - Infection dynamics
A new case is infected at some ​exposure time​, equal to zero if the case is an index case and otherwise
drawn from the ​generation time distribution​ of its parent case (see below). If not asymptomatic, the case
develops symptoms at some​ onset time​ drawn from an ​incubation time distribution​. Asymptomatic
cases do not develop symptoms, but are still assigned an onset time for the purpose of determining their
generation-time distribution (see below).
The number of child cases infected by the case is drawn from a negative binomial distribution, with mean
equal to the appropriate reproduction number (see below) and heterogeneity determined by the
overdispersion parameter ​k.​ The exposure times of these child cases are drawn from a skewed-normal

generation time distribution​ centered on the symptom onset of their parent ​17​, with a skew parameter
chosen to give a pre-specified probability of pre-symptomatic transmission (for a symptomatic parent)
and an SD parameter of 2. The generation time distribution for an asymptomatic parent is centered on its
“effective” onset time (see above). The shape of the generation-time distribution is the same for all cases.
The average number of children produced by a case depends on its symptomatic status, and is determined
by the overall R0 value, the proportion of asymptomatic carriers pasym , and the relative infectiousness
xasym of asymptomatic carriers (expressed as a fraction of R0 ). Given a reproduction number for
asymptomatics of Rasym = R0 · xasym , the reproduction number of symptomatic cases that produces the
desired overall R0 is given by Rsym = Rasym ·

pasym
1−pasym

.

Structure of the model - Infection control
Once symptoms develop, a case is ​identified​ by public health authorities with probability pisol , with the
delay from onset to identification drawn from a ​delay distribution​. Identified cases are instructed to
isolate, and each case complies with that order with probability pcomply . Cases that comply with isolation
generate no further child cases after their time of identification. Asymptomatic cases cannot be identified
from symptoms, but may be identified via contact tracing from other cases (see below); once identified,
they are instructed to isolate as above. Tracing can also cause symptomatic cases to be isolated earlier
than they would be from symptoms alone.

An identified case is ​tested​, which takes time drawn from a test time distribution and returns a positive
result with probability equal to the sensitivity of the test (since the model does not consider uninfected
individuals, the specificity of the test is also not considered). For asymptomatic cases, or symptomatic
cases identified prior to symptom onset, a positive test result is required to initiate contact tracing;
symptomatic cases that have already developed symptoms can either be traced immediately upon
identification, or require a positive test result prior to tracing, depending on model settings.
Whether before or after a test result is obtained, the contacts of an identified case can also be ​traced​.
Tracing can only proceed outward from a case if they share their contact history, either via a
contact-tracing app or with a manual contact tracer (see below). Tracing can identify the children of the
traced case (forward tracing), and may also be able to identify its parent (reverse/backward tracing),
depending on model settings. The speed and success probability of tracing depend upon whether tracing is
conducted digitally or manually, which in turn depends on several factors:
●

If the contact between the trace originator and the tracee occurred environmentally (determined
with probability penv ), tracing cannot take place.

●

If transmission was not environmental, the contact can be traced digitally if:
○

Both the trace originator and the tracee possess chirp-enabled smartphones (determined
independently for each individual case with probability psmartphone );

○

The trace originator shares their data with the tracing app (determined independently for
each individual case with probability pshare_digital );

○

The time of between contact (equal to the exposure time of the child case, i.e. of the trace
in forward tracing and the trace initiator in reverse tracing) and trace initiation is less than
the ​data-retention window​ of the digital tracing system;

○

The contact between the two cases was recorded by the tracing app of the trace originator
(determined independently for each individual case with probability ptrace_digital ).

●

If any of the above conditions are not met, but transmission was not environmental, the contact
might still be traced manually if:
○

The trace originator shares their contact history with a manual contact tracer (determined
independently for each individual case with probability pshare_manual );

○

The time between contact (as above) and the identification time or symptom onset of the
trace initiator (whichever came first) is less than the ​contact-tracing window​ of the
manual tracing system;

○

The tracee is successfully traced by the contact tracer (determined independently for each
individual case with probability ptrace_manual ).

●

If neither digital nor manual tracing succeeds, then the trace fails and the tracee is not traced.

Cases that are successfully traced are identified at a time equal to the ​trace initiation time​ of the trace
originator plus a delay time drawn from the appropriate ​trace delay distribution​ (which will differ
between digital and manual tracing). Cases identified through tracing can then be isolated, tested, and
traced as described above. If a case is isolated through tracing earlier than they would have been
otherwise, child cases whose exposure time would be later than their parent’s new isolation time are
eliminated, as are their descendents.

Run initiation and termination
A simulation of an outbreak under the branching-process model is initialised with a given number of
index cases (by default 20, in order to reduce the probability of stochastic elimination) and proceeds
generation by generation until either no further child cases are generated (extinction) or the run exceeds
one of:
1. A ​cumulative case limit​ of 10,000 cases, reached if the total number of cases ever exceeded that
number, or
2. A ​time limit​ of 52 weeks, reached if the latest exposure time across all cases ever exceeded that
number.
In practice, virtually all runs either went extinct or reached the cumulative case limit; across all scenarios
tested for all datasets used in Figures 2-4, the overall percentage of runs that terminated as a result of
exceeding the time limit was less than 0.02%, and the highest percentage observed for any single scenario
was 1.3%. The cumulative case limit, meanwhile, was selected to minimise the chance of a run that would
otherwise go extinct being terminated prematurely while preserving computational tractability; in test
runs with a cumulative case limit of 100,000 cases, fewer than 2% of extinct runs in any scenario had a
cumulative case count of over 10,000.
A terminated run was deemed “controlled” if it reached extinction, and uncontrolled otherwise. The
control rate for a scenario was computed as the proportion of runs for that scenario that were controlled.
95% credible intervals on the control rate were computed by beta-binomial conjugacy under a B eta(1, 1)
uniform prior, as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the beta distribution B eta(1 + k , 1 + n − k ) , where n

numbers were computed as the average number of child cases produced across all cases in a run, averaged
across all runs in the scenario. For main figures, 1000 runs were performed per scenario; for figures,
either 500 or 1000 runs were performed, as specified in the figure captions.
