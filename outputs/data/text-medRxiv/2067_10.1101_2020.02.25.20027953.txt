Summary
We examined 169 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and found that they can be classified into
two major genotypes, Type I and Type II. Type I can be further divided into Type IA
and IB. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that the Type IA resembles the ancestral
SARS-CoV-2 most. Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the
infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the
outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a
super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred
somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore,
by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found
that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational
efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II
strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than
Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and
control.

Introduction
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel
coronavirus named “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) ”, has now been detected in over 60 nations and lead to more than
80,000 confirmed cases and ~3,000 deaths
(http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/global.html). Although the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 in China seems to be largely contained, the confirmed cases outside
China have been rising. Therefore, the risk of global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is still

growing. Currently, the outbreak sources and the transmission history of
SARS-CoV-2 is far from well-understood. Revealing the evolutionary history of
different SARS-CoV-2 samples allows us to infer the virus transmission routes and to
identify novel mutations associated with the transmissions. Such information will be
valuable for vaccine development and disease control.
Our recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 form a sister group to two SARS-like
bat viruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) [1] that were collected in
Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China, from 2015 to 2017 [2]. A subsequently released
sequence of a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) isolated in Yunnan in 2013 was
found to be more similar to the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 [3], which is confirmed by
our phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences (Figure S1). Therefore,
we used BatCoV RaTG13 and the two SARS-like bat viruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
bat-SL-CoVZXC21) as an outgroup to study the origin and transmission history of
SARS-CoV-2.

Materials and Methods
The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples were obtained from GISAID
(www.gisaid.org), NCBI and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/#/nCov/). Alignment of the
complete genome sequences and that of BatCoV RaTG13 was carried out by MAFFT
[4].
We identified genome variable sites from the sequence alignment using Noisy [5].
Variants that are present in at least two samples were used in our subsequence analysis.
Some samples have unusually large number of mutation sites, which could be due to
due to sequencing or assembly errors. These sequences were also excluded in our
analysis.
We inferred the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates based on the variable sites
using the maximum likelihood (ML) method by FastTree [6]. The tRNA Adaptation
Index (tAI), an indicator of codon translational efficiency, was computed using the
tool Bio::CUA (https://metacpan.org/release/Bio-CUA), and the numbers of human
tRNA genes for each codon (used for computing tAI) were downloaded from
http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu.

Results and discussions
We obtained 169 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 samples and identified
variable sites based on whole genome alignment (Figure 1). In most cases, different
SARS-CoV-2 genomes only differ in 0 to 3 sites. A total number of 207 variable sites
were identified (Figure S2). It shows that the amplitude of mutations is small, and

their evolution history can be inferred from these variable sites.
Their phylogenetic relationships reveal two major genotypes from the
SARS-CoV-2 samples, namely Type I and II (Figures 1A, S3 and S4). The genomes
of the two types mainly differ at three sites (Figure 1B), which are 8750, 28112, and
29063, using the genome coordinates of sample MN938384.1 as a reference.
Specifically, the nucleotides at the three sites are T, C, and T/C in Type I, and C, T,
and C in Type II, respectively. Based on the nucleotide at the site 29063, the Type I
strains can be further divided into Type IA and IB. The number of genomes belonging
to Type IA, IB and II are 11, 37, and 121, respectively.
We found that the three sites in Type IA and two in Type IB are identical to those
in three bat viruses BatCoV RaTG13 [3], bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
bat-SL-CoVZXC21[2](Figure 1B), suggesting that the Type I may be more closely
related to the ancestral human-infecting strain than Type II. Therefore, in the principle
of parsimony, Type IA resembles the most ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2, and
Type IB was derived from Type IA by a new mutation at site 29063. In addition, Type
II may have originated from a Type IB strain by accumulating mutations at sites 8750
and 28112.
Two environmental samples isolated from the Huanan market
(Wuhan/IVDC-HB-envF13-20 and 21) belong to Type II, and no samples from Type I
have a direct link to the Huanan market (such as Wuhan/WH04/2020 [7]). These
observations suggest that the outbreak in the Huanan market was triggered by the
Type II virus and that the initial transmission of Type I viruses to humans might have
occurred somewhere else in Wuhan, probably preceding the outbreak of Type II in the
Huanan market. Our speculation is in line with earlier reports that 14 of the first
reported 41 cases had no link to the Huanan market [7-9].
In addition to the above-mentioned transmission sources, we also found that there
are several large clades in Type II (Group 1-3). The Group-1 of Type II are identical,
suggesting they were likely originated from the same transmission source. Group-2
and Group-3 share at least one mutation, indicating that they shared the same
transmission source. As only a small portion of SARS-CoV-2 isolates have been
sequenced, the actual numbers of infected patients in each group are expected to be
much larger. We speculate that each group was likely from a source of super
transmission or super-spreader.
Because Type II strains account for most of the sampled genomes, it is reasonable
to speculate that Type II is more contagious, assuming no strong sampling bias. To
better understand why the Type II virus is more prevalent, we then focused on the
three variable genomic sites that distinguish Type II from Type I strains. First, we
noticed the mutations at 8750 and 29063 are synonymous (in gene orf1ab and N,
respectively) and the one at 28112 is nonsynonymous, leading to a change from

Leucine to Serine in the gene ORF8. Interestingly, we found that the two synonymous
changes both confer higher translational efficiencies for the Type II strains than for
Type I (Figure 2), based on the number of tRNA genes matching each codon and
tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) [10]. We speculate that the higher translational
efficiencies might have enabled faster production of Type II virus particles, facilitated
its spread, and led to its dominance in infections, implying that Type II is more
contagious (transmissible) than Type I. If our speculation is correct, this would
provide guidelines for treating Type I and II patients differently.
In summary, our results illustrate the presence of two major genotypes of
SARS-CoV-2, suggesting of at least two, possibly three, major outbreak sources
(Figure 3). The outbreak in the Huanan market may not be the initiation transmission
of SARS-CoV-2 to human, and thus the location of initial transmission to humans
remain to be determined. As most samples detected belong to Type II, it indicates that
Type II is more transmissible. We identified three genomic variants that separate the
two types of SARS-CoV-2. Our data suggest that two variants are linked to improved
translation efficiency in Type II. The impacts of these genomic variants could be
further evaluated by comparing the symptoms of patients infected by each type of
viruses. Particularly, some asymptomatic carriers have been recently found [11]. It is
worth examining whether these asymptomatic cases are enriched in Type I. With more
sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2, we expect a more complete understanding of
transmission history.
