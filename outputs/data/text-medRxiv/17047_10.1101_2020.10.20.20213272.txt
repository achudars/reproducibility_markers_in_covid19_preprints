Abstract
We compared symptoms and characteristics of 4961 ambulatory patients with and without
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings indicate that clinical symptoms alone
would be insufficient to distinguish between COVID-19 and other respiratory infections (e.g.,
influenza) and/or to evaluate the effects of preventive interventions (e.g., vaccinations).

Introduction
Since early 2020, pre-established influenza surveillance systems have contributed
substantially to monitoring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United
States. For syndromic surveillance, COVID-like illness is defined as acute illness with fever and
either cough or shortness of breath, or a COVID-19 diagnostic code. To evaluate effectiveness of
interventions to prevent mild illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, standardized
clinical criteria in addition to laboratory confirmation of infection will be needed. In March
2020, participating sites in the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (Flu VE) research network
revised study inclusion criteria to prospectively enroll persons with acute febrile or respiratory
illness, characterized by reported fever or cough or shortness of breath, who had been tested for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we compare symptoms and characteristics of persons with and
without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods
At the study sites of the US Flu VE Network in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington,
and Wisconsin, research staff screened for study eligibility among persons of all ages who had
sought medical care (e.g., telehealth, primary care, urgent care, and emergency departments)
and/or COVID-19 testing for an acute respiratory illness. Eligible individuals reported acute
illness with fever/feverishness, cough, or shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and had a
respiratory specimen collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing within 10 days of illness onset. At four
sites, research staff contacted and screened patients for eligibility by telephone; at one site
(Pennsylvania), a sample of potentially eligible patients was screened for eligibility by phone or
online survey [4]. Standardized questionnaires collected demographic information, general
health status, health-related behaviors such as cigarette smoking or vaping, healthcare-related
employment, and contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19. Questionnaires also
solicited information about twelve specific symptoms experienced since illness onset (Figure).
Respiratory specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays at study sites. Days from illness onset to testing
were calculated using clinical specimen collection date. We classified persons with and without
COVID-19 based on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; persons tested by antigen detection
assays alone were excluded. Underlying medical conditions, associated with increased risk of
severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g., cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or
hypertension) [5], were obtained for participants at four study sites from electronic medical
records based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnostic codes from
medical encounters during the past year, as previously described [6]. Comparisons between
persons with and without COVID-19 were made using chi-square tests (categorical variables) or
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (continuous variables). The p-value for significance was set at 0.05.
This study was approved by institutional review boards at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and all participating sites.
Results
Between March 26 and August 15, 2020, 5760 patients were interviewed and 4961 were
included in analyses. Of 799 patients excluded, 402 (50%) were swabbed, tested or interviewed
more than 10 days after symptom onset, 31 (4%) had inconclusive RT-PCR results or had a
SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (n=11), 82 (10%) were asymptomatic prior to enrollment, and 284
(36%) did not meet clinical criteria during the enrollment interview (i.e., no reported cough,

fever/feverishness or shortness of breath/difficulty breathing). Of 284 not meeting clinical
criteria, 50 (18%) reported decreased taste or smell.
Of 4961 included, 916 persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 4045 with
symptoms but without COVID-19 were included. Patient age and race/ethnicity differed by case
status (p<0.01 for both, Supplemental Table). Compared with persons without COVID-19,
persons with COVID-19 were more likely to be adults aged 18–49 years (65% vs 56%) and less
likely to be younger than 18 years (6% vs 14%). Persons with COVID-19 more frequently selfidentified as Hispanic/Latino (16% vs 7%) or non-Hispanic/Latino Black or African American
(8% vs 6%) and less frequently as non-Hispanic/Latino White or Caucasian (70% vs 81%).
Among patients with information on underlying chronic medical conditions, persons with
COVID-19 less frequently had documented underlying medical conditions than persons without
COVID-19 (42% vs 47%; p=0.02). Among adults aged ≥18 years, similar percentages of persons
with and without COVID-19 identified as healthcare workers (25% vs 26%; p=0.62); persons
with COVID-19 less frequently reported cigarette smoking or vaping (13% vs. 21%, p<0.01).
During the 14 days before symptom onset, contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19 was
reported by 59% of persons with COVID-19 versus 18% of persons without COVID-19
(p<0.01).

COVID-19 (91% and 57%, respectively) than among those without COVID-19 (83% and 50%,
respectively) (p<0.01 for both).

Discussion
For control of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) recommends testing symptomatic persons when there is a concern of potential COVID-19
[2]. Clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are common among patients
seeking healthcare for mild respiratory illness and may not inform decisions on who should be

tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, future evaluation of effectiveness of interventions,
including treatment and vaccination, for prevention of illness or progression to severe disease
will require systematic testing of medically attended illnesses meeting standard clinical criteria
[3]. In this study conducted in five U.S. locations, persons with mild illness seeking clinical care
or COVID-19 testing who met simple, standardized screening criteria (reported fever, cough, or
shortness of breath of ≤10 day duration) commonly reported other respiratory, gastrointestinal, or
systemic symptoms. Although persons with COVID-19 were more likely than those without
COVID-19 to report gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain) or other
symptoms such as muscle aches or headache, the largest difference was observed in diminished
or complete loss of taste or smell, reported by more than half of persons with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 versus one in five persons without COVID-19. Because of the wide
overlap in COVID-19 symptoms with those of other respiratory illnesses, laboratory
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be critical, not only for limiting disease spread,
contact tracing, and monitoring clinical course, but also for assessing the effectiveness of
interventions during periods of co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses,
including influenza.
Rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic patients seeking
healthcare is critical to limit disease spread. Participants in this study, including symptomatic
healthcare workers and patients reporting contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19,
reported a median of 3 days of illness before collection of respiratory specimens for viral testing;
25% reported ≥5 days. Delays in seeking healthcare may result in disease transmission without
strict adherence to recommended preventive measures, especially among persons with a low
index of suspicion for COVID-19. While contact with a known COVID-19 case was strongly
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, almost half of people with COVID-19 did not report
exposure from another person with known COVID-19.
One limitation of this analysis is that only patients meeting screening criteria were
included, thus sensitivity and specificity of other research case definitions were not assessed. In
addition, symptom lists at some study sites did not assess symptoms commonly reported by
outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 (such as fatigue). Because enrollment in this research
study occurred after a clinical swab was obtained for testing, some patients might have been
aware of their test results at the time of enrollment and symptom assessment, which could have
influenced responses to some questions. Finally, persons without COVID-19 (i.e., negative for
SARS CoV-2 by RT-PCR) may have had false negative test results; however, to reduce
misclassification, cases were classified based on results of molecular assays, and participants
were tested within 10 days of illness onset.
In addition to establishing clinical criteria for mild illness to evaluate interventions to
prevent COVID-19, systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza will be needed when both
viruses circulate for assessing effectiveness of 2020–2021 seasonal influenza vaccines [4, 9].
Symptom criteria that can be rapidly assessed before enrollment in research studies of influenza
and COVID-19 would help ensure systematic testing for both viruses. Sensitivity and specificity
of screening criteria including subjective fever, cough, and loss of taste or smell should be
assessed among ambulatory persons with COVID-19 for use in epidemiologic studies [9].
