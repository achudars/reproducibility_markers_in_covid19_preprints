Abstract:

Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2

30

infection, but their effectiveness depends on coverage and adherence levels. We used scenario

31

modeling to evaluate their effects on cases and deaths averted and herd immunity. NPIs and

32

vaccines worked synergistically in different parts of the pandemic to reduce disease burden.

Background

39
40

Since the beginning of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infections have led to a reported 2,492,668

41

cases and 40,361 deaths through December 31, 2020 in California. Amidst the winter surge, a

42

regional stay-at-home order was in effect at the end of 2020 that affected 98% of Californians.

43

Concurrently, starting in December, administration of two authorized vaccines began in the state

44

in accordance with recommended prioritization schemes, first targeting the Phase 1A priority

45

groups [1-6]. In January, California then relaxed restrictions to allow adults 65+, who are at

46

highest risk of COVID-related mortality, to receive the vaccine sooner [6]. The secondary

47

prioritization based on age was due in part to data from studies of the two vaccines describing

48

higher efficacy for reducing disease severity as measured by hospitalization and death [2-5].

49
50

The potential synergistic effects of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to

51

reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission and consequent disease are not well understood.

52

Considering the complexity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and health effects, it is

important to estimate the effects of vaccine uptake alongside other interventions using

54

mathematical modeling. We aimed to assess the effects of different levels and strategies of

55

NPIs and vaccination on key epidemiological outcomes in California, specifically cases, deaths,

56

and time until herd immunity. We investigated the impact on projected cases and deaths of a

57

65+ vaccine prioritization strategy compared with vaccinating all adults, and considered the

58

interaction between vaccines that partially reduce transmission with continued NPIs on these

59

outcomes for the population of California. Finally, we examined how these combinations of NPIs

60

and vaccination levels might impact progression to a theoretical herd immunity in 2021.

63

Methods

64
65

We used a modified, age-stratified compartmental (SEIR) model based on a previously

66

published model [7] and parameterized for the state of California. We varied adherence to NPIs

67

by scaling of the contact matrix between age groups, including 65 – 74 and 75 years and older

68

to account for changing age-based prioritization of vaccines. The effects of specific NPIs were

69

not separately estimated, but rather the rescaled contact matrix was used to represent the total

70

effect of different NPIs and adherence levels on contact rates for specified scenarios. Initial

71

conditions corresponded to PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and consequent deaths

72

reported to the California Department of Public Health by January 1, 2021. We assumed that

73

cases diagnosed in the preceding 2 weeks were actively infectious and cases diagnosed in the

74

following two weeks after January 1 were exposed as of January 1 but not yet infectious.

75

Immunity from prior infection (i.e., those considered “Recovered”) at the start of model

76

simulations was estimated from available statewide seroprevalence data, which suggested that

77

a third of estimated infections became cases confirmed by PCR. Theoretical “herd immunity”

78

threshold is considered 60 – 70% based on an estimated R0 of 2.5 – 3.3. To estimate herd

immunity, we included all successful vaccinations and natural infections and did not consider

80

waning immunity.

81
82
83

Scenarios

84
85

We compared 18 different scenarios covering 3 NPI levels (implemented as contact rates), 3

86

vaccine coverage levels, and 2 vaccine prioritization strategies to model their interactive effects

87

on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and herd immunity. Vaccination coverage rate varied between

88

20%, 40% and 60% of the total California population (40.3 million) over 6 months. Contact rates

89

(i.e., the amount of contact between persons and across age strata that could facilitate COVID-

90

19 transmission) varied by scaling the contact matrix for low (corresponding to the 2019 pre-

91

pandemic rates), moderate (between June and October 2020 when mobility was fairly stable),

92

and high (April 2020, after the first stay-at-home order) NPI scenarios [8]. Vaccination

93

prioritization scenarios considered were either all adults (18+) or adults 65+ only, according to

94

the implemented prioritization scheme in California.

95
96

We assumed that the currently approved vaccines work similarly well and are 90% effective at

97

preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death, and 50% effective at reducing

98

transmission [9]. We assumed 25% vaccine hesitancy in every age stratum. Vaccine distribution

99

occurred at a constant daily rate according to the level of coverage/speed specified in each

100

scenario such that distribution was completed over the six months from January through June

101

2021. The vaccines are modeled as providing “all-or-nothing” protection and with variable

102

transmission blocking as previously described [7].

Results

106
107

Scenarios of different NPI levels with different levels of vaccine coverage avert more cases and

108

deaths compared with a base scenario of pre-pandemic contact rates and no vaccination

109

(Figure 1). For cases, NPI adherence had the biggest effect on reducing incidence compared

110

with the vaccination-related factors, particularly in the first half of the simulation (January-April).

111

For cases, scenario results ranged from 450,000 (9%) cases averted (65+ prioritized, 20%

112

vaccine coverage, low NPIs) to 3,850,000 (79%) cases averted (all adults, 60% vaccine

113

coverage, high NPIs) (Supplement Table 1). For deaths, vaccination-related factors and NPIs

114

interacted synergistically to reduce deaths, with 65+ prioritization having a significant impact.

115

For deaths, scenario results range from 21,300 (11%) deaths averted (all adults, 20% vaccine

116

coverage, low NPIs) to 128,700 (68%) deaths averted (65+ prioritized, 60% vaccine coverage,

117

high NPIs) (Supplemental Table 2).

118
119

Model results for progression towards herd immunity over the course of the projection period

120

vary by scenario (Figure 2). With 60% intended vaccination coverage, herd immunity is reached

121

between May and July 2021 in California. Herd immunity is not reached in any of the 0% and

122

20% vaccination coverage scenarios. While high levels of NPI adherence delay achievement of

123

herd immunity compared with lower levels of NPI adherence by 2 months at 60% vaccination

124

coverage, this scenario averts 2,540,000 more cases (68%) and 45,800 more deaths (36%).

125
126
127

Discussion

128
129

Our results show that even with high vaccination coverage, concomitant NPIs are required to

130

reduce cumulative deaths (Figure 1A). NPI adherence figures prominently because NPIs drive

131

total cases down faster than vaccinations alone (Figure 1B). Even with no vaccination, a high

132

level of NPI adherence averts 74% of COVID-19 cases and 61% of COVID-19 deaths over the

133

simulation period between January and July 2021 (Supplemental Table 1). Our findings

134

demonstrate that continued NPIs are important for preventing additional deaths and cases while

135

vaccine deployment scales up. In a scenario in which 20% of the total population has been

136

vaccinated with age prioritization, a moderate level of physical distancing would still avert

137

89,000 (47%) deaths compared to low physical distancing, which would avert 38,300 (20%)

138

deaths. Current COVID-19 case and death trajectories in 2021 suggest that California is

139

operating at moderate NPIs scenario levels, and our current vaccination strategy prioritizes the

140

+65 cohort. Currently, California is on track to vaccinate 60% or more of the population by July

141

2021.Under these conditions we would expect to avert 59% of deaths compared to the base

142

scenario.

143
144

Our model also describes the relationship between vaccination coverage, NPIs and “herd

145

immunity,” the level of immunity sufficient to disrupt and prevent sustained disease

146

transmission. Even with accelerating vaccination rates, a level of herd immunity sufficient to

147

eliminate the need for NPIs may not be achieved for 6 months or more. Although maintaining

148

NPIs during vaccination scale-up may be challenging, such measures could prevent 100,000+

149

additional deaths in California from occurring. The effect of higher NPI adherence on delaying

150

herd immunity, due to averted infections contributing natural immunity, is outweighed by the

151

effects of increasing vaccination speed and coverage on reducing deaths and incident cases

152

(Figure 2).

153
154

Our results suggest that prioritizing Californians 65+ reduces cumulative deaths substantially at

155

all levels of vaccine coverage. Based on our findings, we estimate that 40% vaccine coverage in

156

the 65+ age group has approximately the same reduction in deaths as vaccination coverage of

157

at least 80% among the entire adult population over the same time. While not explicitly

158

modeled, hospitalizations preceding deaths are also likely to be substantially reduced by

159

prioritizing adults 65+, which would otherwise strain California’s health system.

160
161

Like all scenario models, ours has limitations, the first being inherent uncertainty about

162

parameters and scenario conditions. Our assumptions about the effects of vaccination on

163

transmission are conservative, due to relatively limited evidence of effectiveness against

164

asymptomatic transmission. This may also affect the timeframe for reaching herd immunity.

165

Additionally, our analyses do not currently account for increasing prevalence of novel SARS-

166

CoV-2 variants that are more infectious or immune evasive. Each of these challenges support

167

maintaining a conservative approach to NPIs.

168
169

Our analyses provide evidence to support continued disease control and prevention efforts,

170

including masking, social/physical distancing, ventilation, and hand hygiene (i.e., NPIs), during

171

initial COVID-19 vaccine implementation. First, the effect of vaccination in low NPI scenarios is

172

attenuated by ongoing transmission while herd immunity is still distant. Second, despite

173

potential accelerated scale up of vaccinations, levels of herd immunity required to reduce the

174

need for NPIs would not be reached until summer 2021 or later, absent a major increase in

175

vaccine supply and distribution.

176
177

Public health stakeholders should continue implementing both vaccines and physical distancing

178

measures (NPIs) simultaneously to reduce transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths as we

179

aspire for pandemic control and until herd immunity, driven by vaccination, reaches a sufficient

180

level to ensure protection for the most vulnerable.
