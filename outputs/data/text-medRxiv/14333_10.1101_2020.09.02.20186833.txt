Abstract—The reported recovered cases for many US states
are low which could be due to difficulties in keeping track of
recoveries and resulted in higher numbers for the reported active
cases than the actual numbers on the ground. These incorrect
numbers can lead to misleading inferences. In this work, based
on the typical range of recovery rate of COVID-19, we estimate
the active data from the total cases and death cases and bring
out a correction for the data for all the US states reported on
worldometer.
Keywords— COVID-19, Mathematical Model, epidemiology

BACKGROUND
The availability of accurate data of an epidemic is important as
the data provides key insights on the disease spread and enable the
authorities to take a decision on control measures. Worldometer is
one of the very popular sources of the global COVID-19 data and
it is also trusted and used by many government bodies and agencies
[1]. The available data for the COVID-19 cases can be used for the
prediction and analysis of hospitalization and meeting the demands
of health care facilities and setting up the critical care systems for
the patients [2] [3]. The active cases represent the number of infected
people whether symptomatic or asymptomatic detected through selfreporting or testing. This number is important for Public Health
authorities to estimate the current status of the disease spread and
can be calculated by subtracting death and recovered cases from the
total confirmed cases.

The number of mild cases is reported to be 81% in a Chinese
study [8]. Covid-19 data reported from 49 states, the District of
Columbia, and three U.S. territories to CDC from February 12–March
16 shows that 20.7 reported cases were severe and were hospitalized
[9]. COVID-NET regions show this number to be 21.4 % till April
4 [10], [11] and IHME data March 5- April 4 shows that to be 20.3
% [12] [13]. According to WHO recovery time for mild cases is of
2 weeks and for severe cases that recovery time of 3-6 weeks. [14].
Considering 80% mild cases, the recovery rate cannot be as low as
appears from the data for the states listed in column 2 in Table 1.
The correct estimation of the active cases can be done by
subtracting the death and recovery cases, with appropriate recovery
rate, from the total cases. The woldometer data for total cases and
death cases are assumed to be true as the test positive results and
count of diseased cases are done more stringently as compared to
recovery counting. The active cases can be obtained by solving the
following differential equation,
dT ptq
dDptq
dHptq
“
´
´ σHpt ´ tR q

where, H, T , and D are the active, total, and death cases. The
recovery from the infected category is defined by the two parameters:
delay in recovery tR and the recovery rate σ. As these values
are dependent upon the immune system of the community and the
hospital facilities, it should not vary much within the USA. We have
taken tR as 10 days and σ as 0.048 (21 days of mean recovery time
considering both mild and severe cases).

R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION

A compartmental predictive mathematical model SIPHERD for
COVID-19 disease dynamics is described in [4], [5] where recovery
rate is a model parameter and is fixed by optimizing the model with
the actual data. The data for the total, death, and active cases for
168 days from March 4, 2020, is taken from Worldometer [1] and
found close to total cases and death data from [6]. After running the
SIPHERD model for the USA, as reported in [4], the recovery rate
of the active category was found to be 0.015 (corresponding to 66
days of mean recovery time) which is very low compared to other
countries like Germany and India [4] [5] where it is found 0.065. The
low recovery rate in the USA may be attributed to either incorrect
reporting of the Active cases [7] or the testing of serious cases
only and longer recovery time in hospitals compared to quarantined
with mild symptoms. Secondly, keeping the record of recoveries is
difficult because some of the infected people are asked to quarantine
while only critical patients are hospitalized. Sometimes the reporting
of those recoveries is not accurate or incomplete. This has led to
inconsistent data for active cases.

The above delay differential equation is solved for all the states of
the USA and we found three groups among the states according to
the accuracy of the data. The active cases reported on worldometer
[1] for a few states show excellent agreement with our estimation of
active cases. One example state for this group is Texas as seen in Fig.
1(a). There are few states in the second group which are largely not
matching with analytical estimation indicating that reported active
data is inaccurate. These states are listed in column 2 in Table 1 and
one representative state is Virginia as seen in Fig. 1(b), where the
currently active cases are reported to be 97560 which should have
been just around 21664 according to our calculation. Interestingly,
in the last group, there are some states for which the reported active
cases do not follow the estimated active cases for the initial days,
however, the reported data of the active cases take a sudden fall and
follow our estimation as seen for Indiana in Fig. 1(c). This clearly
indicates that the active cases data corrections is done after some days
and also validates our analytical approach. In Fig. 1, the reported total
and active cases with the estimated active cases for one of the states

in all the three groups are shown, the figures for remaining states are
given in supplementary material.
The recovery rate in individual states may vary to an extent of
˘10% depending on the variation in the number of tests performed,
fraction of mild and severe cases. However, we have taken a uniform
value of recovery rate as 0.048 for all the US states.

C ONCLUSIONS
The reported active cases for a few states is consistent with the
total detected cases and death cases for a recovery rate parameter
value 0.048. For a few states, the data has been corrected recently.
However, for 21 states, the active cases data is still largely incorrect.
We generate the corrected active case data for all states, report in the
supplementary material, and also keep it available on Github.
