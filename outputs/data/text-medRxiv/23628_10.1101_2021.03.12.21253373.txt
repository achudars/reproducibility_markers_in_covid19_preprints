Abstract
Background: Although convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat severe coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), data from randomized controlled trials that support its efficacy are
limited.
Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults
hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19.
Design: Randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April
21st to November 27th, 2020.
Setting: Five hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).
Participants: Hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19,
infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation ≤ 94% on room air or requirement for
supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation.
Intervention: Participants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of
convalescent or normal control plasma.
Measurements: The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal
scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population.
Results: Of 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma
and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was
observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (with an odds ratio (OR) of a 1point improvement in the scale: 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180).
However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent
plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.220.91, p=0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused
convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab
samples (n=40) from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-

escape mutants was detected. Serious adverse events occurred in 39/147 (27%) participants
who received convalescent plasma and 26/72 (36%) participants who received control plasma.
Limitations: Some participants did not receive high-titer convalescent plasma.
Conclusion: In adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not
associated with significant improvement in 28 days clinical status. The significant reduction in
mortality associated with convalescent plasma, however, may warrant further evaluation.

Introduction
As of March 4th, 2021, over 115 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) had been
reported worldwide (1). Available data suggest that approximately 10-25% of patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection develop severe COVID-19 characterized primarily by pneumonia and in
a subset, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (2-4) and among severe cases, mortality
occurs in 39-49% (2,4).

Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, convalescent plasma was proposed as a rapidly
scalable therapeutic to prevent or mitigate severe illness through virus neutralization or
antibody-dependent immunomodulation (5). During recent epidemics of emerging respiratory
viruses such as SARS-CoV, H5N1 and 2009 H1N1 influenza, observational and nonrandomized studies reported improved clinical outcomes and minimal adverse effects
associated with use of convalescent plasma in severely ill patients (6). In patients with severe
COVID-19, observational studies have suggested possible clinical efficacy and safety using
convalescent plasma, primarily among patients not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation
(IMV) and those with shorter durations of illness (7-10). Despite these signals, data from
randomized controlled trials supporting use of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 are limited. Open-label trials from India and China reported no significant
improvements in clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19; the
latter was substantially underpowered (11,12). A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
Argentina reported no improvement in clinical outcomes with use of convalescent plasma
among adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, including among subgroups stratified by
illness duration and clinical severity (13).

In the United States and Brazil, approximately 28.7 and 10.7 million cases of Covid-19 have
been reported as of March 4th, 2021, respectively (1). Given the lack of effective medical
therapies against SARS-CoV-2, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled phase 2
clinical trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults
hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19 in New York City and Rio de Janeiro.

Methods
Study Design
This was an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19.
The trial was conducted at five sites in New York City (USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and
was coordinated by Columbia University. Study sites included two hospitals affiliated with New
York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in northern
Manhattan (Milstein and Allen Hospitals) and three sites in Rio de Janeiro (Instituto Nacional de
Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Hospital Federal dos Servidores do Estado, and Hospital Geral
de Nova lguaçu). Participants were enrolled at CUIMC beginning April 21st, 2020, and at the
three clinical sites in Rio de Janeiro beginning August 15th, 2020. The trial was conducted in
accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Brazilian
National Ethics Committee Resolution 466/12. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants or from their legally authorized representative. The trial protocol was approved by
institutional review boards at CUIMC and at each site in Rio de Janeiro (14) and is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04359810).

Participants
Eligible participants were hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years with evidence of SARS-CoV-2
infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal swab or

tracheal aspirate sample within 14 days of randomization, with infiltrates on chest imaging and
oxygen saturation ≤ 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen (including noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow supplemental oxygen), IMV, or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of screening. Exclusion criteria included:
participation in another clinical trial of anti-viral agent(s) for COVID-19; receipt of any anti-viral
agent with possible activity against SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of randomization; duration of
IMV or ECMO ≥ 5 days at time of screening; severe multi-organ failure; and a history of prior
reactions to transfusion blood products. Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Emergency Use Authorization on May 1st, 2020 (15), concomitant use of remdesivir was
permitted. The use of other treatments, including corticosteroids, was at the discretion of
treating clinicians, and supportive care was provided according to standards at each site.

Procedures
Convalescent plasma used at all study sites was collected by the New York Blood Center from
patients who had recovered from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, provided informed consent,
had a minimum anti-SARS-CoV-2 total IgG antibody titer of ≥1:400 by quantitative enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay against the spike protein (16), were at least 14 days asymptomatic
following resolution of COVID-19, and had a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 from a
nasopharyngeal swab. Control plasma consisted of oldest available plasma at each study site
without prior testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; all control plasma was collected prior to
January 1st, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro and February 20th, 2020 in New York City. For all
participants who received their treatment assignment, a single unit of plasma (~200-250
milliliters) was transfused over approximately 2 hours. Titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody were measured in convalescent plasma units post hoc. Neutralization titer was
determined with a SARS-CoV-2 viral neutralization assay which measured inhibition of virus
growth after exposure to serial plasma dilutions using quantitative real-time reverse

transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Further details are described in the protocol (14) and
supplement. Given concern for emerging viral variants, we performed genomic sequencing of
SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab samples from a subset of patients enrolled in Brazil.
Sequences were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (sequence NC_045512) in
NCBI. Additional details are included in the supplement.

Randomization and Blinding
Enrolled participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either convalescent plasma or
control plasma using a web-based randomization platform; treatment assignments were
generated using randomly permuted blocks of different sizes. Participants were transfused
within 48 hours of randomization. The clinical teams directly managing patients and the trial
clinicians who adjudicated clinical status and determined 28-day outcomes were blinded to
treatment allocation. The hospital blood bank at each site and the clinical research teams who
completed case record forms and performed other study specific procedures were not blinded;
this was done to prevent errors in treatment allocation.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was clinical status at day 28 following randomization, measured using an
ordinal scale based on that recommended by the World Health Organization (17): 1, not
hospitalized with resumption of normal activities; 2, not hospitalized, but unable to resume
normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4, hospitalized, requiring
supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy or noninvasive
mechanical ventilation; 6, hospitalized, requiring ECMO, IMV, or both; 7, death. Since
distinguishing between clinical status 1 and 2 on the ordinal scale was difficult in participants
discharged from hospital, these two scores were combined, and a six-point ordinal scale was
used for all analyses of the primary outcome. Pre-specified secondary outcomes included time-

to-clinical improvement (defined as improvement in at least one point from baseline on the
ordinal scale or alive at discharge from hospital, whichever came first), in-hospital mortality, 28day mortality, time-to-discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, time-to-hospital discharge, and
serious and grade 3 and 4 adverse events.

The initial primary outcome was time-to-clinical-improvement. However, it became clear that this
primary outcome would not reflect instances when patients’ clinical status subsequently
worsened after improvement. Thus, the primary outcome of the study was amended to clinical
status at day 28, and time-to-clinical-improvement became a secondary outcome. This change
was made on August 8th, 2020 (at which point 31% [70/223] of the trial population was enrolled)
without any knowledge of outcome data, and the protocol was updated accordingly with
approval of the data safety and monitoring board (14).

Clinical status and adverse events were assessed daily during hospitalization through review of
medical records and/or in-person visits. For participants discharged prior to day 28, clinical
status and adverse events were determined via telephone and/or in-person visits. In patients
who were discharged from hospital alive and not reachable for day 28 assessment, the last
available clinical status was carried forward for the primary analysis, and sensitivity analyses
were performed to account for potential bias due to loss-to-follow-up.

Statistical Analysis
The trial was analyzed by comparing patients randomized to convalescent plasma versus
control plasma, with patients randomized to control plasma serving as the reference group. The
primary outcome was analyzed using a one-sided Mann-Whitney test for an alternative
hypothesis favoring the convalescent plasma arm (a “go” decision in this phase 2 trial). To
assess the magnitude of clinical effects, an odds ratio (OR) for improved clinical status on the

11
modified ordinal scale was estimated under the proportional odds model. An OR >1.0 indicated
improved clinical status among patients randomized to convalescent plasma versus control
plasma. Post-hoc analyses of the primary outcome were also performed using a multivariable
proportional odds model including age, sex, and duration of illness at baseline, prognostic
factors imbalanced between treatment groups after randomization. Additional details are
available in the supplement.

Pre-specified subgroups in analyses of the primary outcome were defined according to level of
respiratory support at randomization (no supplemental oxygen, supplemental oxygen [including
high-flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation], IMV or ECMO) and symptom duration at
randomization (≤7days, >7days) (14). Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed
according to study country, age, sex, concomitant treatment with corticosteroids, and by titers of
neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in infused convalescent plasma units.

For the initial primary outcome of time-to-clinical-improvement, the intended sample size was
129 participants. However, after the primary outcome was amended, the sample size was recalculated based on blinded pooled data of day 28 outcomes from an interim analysis by the
data safety and monitoring board (July 2nd, 2020) and an OR of 1.7 under a proportional odds
assumption. With a 2:1 randomization ratio and a total sample size of 219 participants (146 in
the convalescent plasma arm versus 73 in the control arm), we determined that a one-sided
Mann-Whitney test at a level of 15% would have 82% power to detect an OR 1.7. At the time
the primary outcome was amended, a recent trial of remdesivir reported an OR 1.50 with 95%
confidence interval (CI) of 1.18–1.91, which overlapped with our assumed OR (18).

Between group differences are reported using point estimates (OR or hazard ratio [HR]), with
95% confidence intervals and p-values. The p-value for the Mann-Whitney test in the primary

outcome analysis (“go vs. “no-go” decision) is one-sided. All other p-values including those
associated with point estimates are 2-sided and without adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Role of the funding source
The trial was funded by an unrestricted grant from the Amazon Foundation to Columbia
University. The funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis or data
interpretation. One co-author (VG) who contributed to writing of the manuscript is employed by
Amazon Care.

Results
Participants
Between April 21st and November 27th, 2020, a total of 630 patients were evaluated for inclusion
criteria across the five study sites. Two-hundred-twenty-three were enrolled, randomized and
included in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis (Figure 1). Four participants were randomized
but did not receive their assigned treatment: three participants (two randomized to convalescent
plasma and one to control plasma) had improvements in oxygen saturation to >94% prior to
transfusion, and one participant randomized to convalescent plasma developed a
maculopapular rash prior to receipt of plasma for which subsequent transfusion was deferred.
Thus, 219 patients were included in the per-protocol and safety analysis: 147 participants
transfused convalescent plasma, and 72 participants transfused control plasma (Figure 1). Data
on neutralizing antibody titers were available for 89% (130/150) of convalescent plasma units.
Of these, the median titer was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320).

Of the 223 participants enrolled, 73 were enrolled in New York City and 150 in Rio de Janeiro
(Table 1). The median age of participants was 61 years and 66% (147/223) were male. The

median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 9 days. Nearly all participants required
respiratory support at baseline: 57% (126/223) of participants required supplemental oxygen,
25% (55/223) required high-flow oxygen therapy or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and
13% (28/223) required IMV or ECMO. Some imbalances were present between treatment
groups; participants enrolled in the convalescent plasma group were younger, with fewer men
and a slightly longer symptom duration. During the trial period, 81% (181/223) of participants
received corticosteroids and 6% (13/223) received remdesivir, the latter exclusively in New York
City.

Primary outcome assessment of clinical status at 28 days was completed for 215 (96%) of 223
randomized patients. Eight participants with indeterminate clinical status at day 28 were
discharged alive but were unable to be contacted at day 28. Of these eight participants, three
had ≥14 days of follow-up and five had <14 days of follow-up.

Primary outcome
Although participants randomized to receive convalescent plasma had 1.5 times the odds of a
one-point improvement in clinical status at day 28, this difference was not statistically significant
(OR 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-2.68, p=0.18 (Table 2)). After adjustment for age,
sex, and illness duration, the odds of improvement were similar (Table 2). Results were also
similar in unadjusted and adjusted analyses of the per-protocol population and in two sensitivity
analyses, one in which the 8 participants without a definitive day 28 outcome were considered
deceased, and another in which the last available clinical status was carried forward for patients
with ≥14 days of follow-up and patients with <14 days of follow-up were considered deceased
(Tables S1-S3). Using a one-sided Mann-Whitney test of the alternative hypothesis favoring the
convalescent plasma arm, the primary outcome analysis of the ITT population was consistent
with a “go” decision (p=0.09) in this phase 2 clinical trial.

28-day Mortality
In the ITT population, mortality at 28 days was significantly lower among participants
randomized to convalescent versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR
0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034) when the last available clinical status was carried forward for
the 8 patients without definitive day 28 outcome status (Table 2, Figure 2). These results were
consistent in adjusted analyses and in sensitivity analyses to account for the 8 patients without
definitive day 28 outcome (Tables 2 and S4-S5). All recorded deaths occurred during
hospitalization. No significant between-group differences were observed in the other secondary
outcomes (Table 2 and Figure 3).

Subgroup Analyses
In pre-specified analyses of the primary outcome based on respiratory support and symptom
duration at baseline, no significant between-group differences were observed in the primary
outcome (Figure 4 and Tables S6-S7). However, we observed trends towards improved clinical
status among patients who received convalescent plasma ≤7 days after symptom onset and
those who received convalescent plasma with higher-titers of neutralizing antibody and
concomitant corticosteroids (Figures 4 and S1-S2 and Tables S6-S7). In stratified analyses of
28-day mortality, unadjusted point-estimates consistently favored the convalescent plasma
group (Figure S3).

SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing
RNA template was sufficient to recover near complete (>99%) genomic sequence from 40
nasopharyngeal samples from Brazil. Twenty-nine (73%) represented common clades
circulating worldwide and had no spike protein mutations. None of the samples contained the
mutations characteristic of B.1.1.28 P1. Four had mutations found in B.1.1.28 (E484K) but did
not have the N501Y, K417N/T mutations found in P1. One sample had 3 of 4 mutations

characteristic of B.1.1.28 (AM-II), including V1176K in S, that is not known to impair
neutralization. In short, we found no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants.

Safety Analysis
Serious adverse events occurred in 39 of 147 (26.5%) patients who received convalescent
plasma and 26 of 72 (36.1%) patients who received control plasma (Tables S8-S11). Adverse
events considered as definitely or probably associated with plasma transfusion were reported in
4 of 147 (2.7%) patients who received convalescent plasma and 3 of 72 (4.2%) patients who
received control plasma. In patients who received convalescent plasma, these events included
worsening anemia, urticaria, skin rash, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload.

Discussion
In this randomized, blinded, and controlled phase 2 trial conducted in New York City and Rio de
Janeiro, treatment with convalescent plasma as compared to control plasma did not result in
significant clinical improvement at 28 days, based on an ordinal scale of clinical status, among
adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19. However, mortality at 28 days was
significantly lower among patients randomized to convalescent plasma. This effect on mortality
was observed across analyses adjusted for imbalances in baseline variables with prognostic
relevance and in sensitivity analyses performed to account for indeterminate 28-day vital status
in 8 patients.

Although limited, available data suggest that treatment efficacy for convalescent plasma may be
dependent on illness duration and severity and titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody
in transfused plasma. In a recent clinical trial from Argentina, transfusion of high-titer
convalescent plasma within 72 hours of symptom onset prevented progression to severe illness
among elderly adults with mild COVID-19 (19). In contrast, no overall improvements in clinical

status were observed in recent trials of convalescent plasma among inpatients with severe
COVID-19 in China and Argentina (11,13). However, subgroup analyses in these trials
suggested a possible benefit among patients with less severe and shorter durations of illness.
These signals are consistent with results of a retrospective study of over 3,000 U.S. adults who
received convalescent plasma for treatment of severe COVID-19 (10). In this retrospective
analysis, high-titer convalescent plasma was associated with improved mortality among
inpatients who were not receiving IMV at the time of transfusion. Considering power limitations
of our trial, we observed similar trends towards improvement in the primary outcome among
patients in the convalescent plasma group transfused within 7 days of symptom onset and those
who received convalescent plasma with higher-titers of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody.

In the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, some of which may be associated with
greater transmissibility and more severe illness (20), convalescent plasma may offer distinct
therapeutic advantages. Since convalescent plasma, which contains polyclonal antibodies, may
be donated and transfused locally, and its use may be more adaptable to rapidly changing local
viral ecology than other interventions. In contrast, monoclonal antibody therapies may need to
be repeatedly engineered and combined to optimize potency among emergent SARS-CoV-2
variants (21,22). Further, since collection and distribution of convalescent plasma units can be
performed using existing blood donation protocols and infrastructure, convalescent plasma may
be more scalable for use in low- and middle-income countries.

Although clinical status at 28 days was not significantly different between treatment groups,
28-day mortality was significantly lower among patients randomized to receive convalescent
plasma. Although this secondary outcome was pre-specified, our study was not powered to
detect a difference in mortality and analyses of our secondary outcomes were not adjusted for
multiplicity. This finding should be interpreted with caution until full results from larger inpatient

trials adequately powered to detect differences in mortality, such as the Randomised Evaluation
of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY), are available (23).

We observed no significant difference in adverse events between treatment groups and very
few events were considered related to plasma infusion. Although use of control plasma may
have potentially contributed to hypercoagulability (24), the incidence of thrombotic events in our
study population was similar to that reported in observational studies of patients with severe
COVID-19 (25).

Our trial has several strengths. First, the randomized, blinded, controlled design of our trial was
implemented with high adherence to the study protocol. Second, we enrolled severe and critical
COVID-19 patients in racially and ethnically diverse urban settings in two countries. Third, our
strategy for qualification and collection of convalescent plasma was pragmatic, increasing
generalizability of our findings to settings where quantification of neutralization activity is
unavailable. However, we quantified neutralizing antibody titers in approximately 90% of
convalescent plasma samples post hoc. Fourth, our use of control plasma was a significant
strength since both study agents had the same appearance, enhancing the blinded nature of the
trial, and both had a similar effect on volume expansion. As convalescent plasma may have
other immunomodulatory factors apart from anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, such as
immunoglobulins, hemostatic proteins and cytokines, use of normal plasma as a comparator
allowed us to evaluate the effect of convalescent antibodies while controlling for these other
factors.
Our trial has several limitations. First, although convalescent plasma was collected from donors
with anti-SARS-CoV-2 total IgG antibody titer of ≥1:400, neutralizing antibody titers in some
convalescent plasma units were low, and we do not have data on antibody titers in patient
samples pre- and post-transfusion. Second, while all control plasma units were collected prior to

the first known cases of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro and New York City, one out of 19 units
tested neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at low titer. Although this could represent a false-positive, it is
possible that other control plasma units could have contained anti-coronavirus antibodies. Third,
supportive care was not standardized across study sites. However, we observed no significant
differences in outcomes in stratified by country. Fourth, the trial was underpowered for
secondary outcomes and multiple comparisons.

In conclusion, although the use of convalescent plasma was not associated with improved day
28 clinical status based on an ordinal scale, it was associated with a significant reduction in day
28 mortality. This result should be interpreted with caution pending results from larger inpatient
trials and may warrant further evaluation.
