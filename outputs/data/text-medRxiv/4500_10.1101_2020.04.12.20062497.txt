ABSTRACT
Objectives
With large numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ventilators possibly
being in short supply, in extremis two patients may have to share one ventilator. Careful matching
of patient ventilation requirements is necessary. However, good matching is difficult to achieve as
lung characteristics can have a wide range and may vary over time. Adding flow restriction to the
flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and
hence flow and volume individually for each patient. This study aimed to create and validate a
simple model for calculating required flow restriction.
Design/Setting
Experimental/Secondary Care
Methods
We created a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the
ventilator tubing system and lung allowing direct calculation of the relationships between pressures,
volumes, and required flow restriction. Experimental measurements were made for parameter
determination and validation using a clinical ventilator connected to two test lungs. For validation,
differing amounts of restriction were introduced into the ventilator circuit.
Results
The BathRC model was able to predict tidal lung volumes with a mean error of 4% (min:1.2%,
max:9.3%).
Conclusion
We present a simple model validated model that can be used to estimate required flow restriction
for dual patient ventilation. The BathRC model is freely available; this tool is provided to
demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated.

INTRODUCTION
The current COVID-19 crisis could risk ventilator capacity shortfall. If necessary, ventilator capacity
could be increased by ventilating two patients using the machine, namely Dual Patient Ventilation
(DPV). This would require two circle systems, connected in parallel, as per the work of Neyman &
Irvin1, and Paladina et al.2. Complexity arises when patients have different airway and lung
impedances as each would require different ventilator settings. Hence, distributing and controlling
pressure and flow to each patient, independently, is a significant challenge. Accordingly, the
Anesthetic Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) has mandated against ventilator sharing3.
The COVID-19 crisis has renewed interest in DPV and, in March 2020, this approach was introduced
in New York, adopting the “Columbia Protocol” of ventilation4. This relies on careful matching of
patient characteristics, and its effectiveness would be sensitive to changes in patient compliance. A
new experimental study by Tronstad et al.5in relation to COVID-19 concluded that large
discrepancies were found in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs with compliance
differences. Furthermore, high Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) could strongly influence the
distribution of tidal volume. They were unable to reliably overcome this hazard.
Evidence is emerging that lung compliance in COVID-19 patients is not as reduced as in other forms
of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS6. Nevertheless, DPV for patients with differing
characteristics, particularly tidal volume due to differing compliances, will still require a modified
breathing circle. This refers to the introduction of an impedance (resistance or compliance) to
appropriately distribute the supplied tidal volume. Increasing the resistance in the inspiratory limb of
the patient with either the higher lung compliance or the one requiring a lower tidal volume seems
plausible. This is the subject of this paper. A team from Hospital Geel, Belgium, have been
experimenting with the same technique7, and there has been a recent simulation study8. This latter
work succinctly reviews previous work on DPV and the challenges involved.
A single circle system for one patient has a unidirectional valve in each of its inspiratory and
expiratory limbs. These are usually integrated into the anaesthetic machine circle system
attachments. A key risk of DPV is inadvertent sharing of gas flows either between patients or
between the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of a single patient. Installing two parallel circle
systems, each with two directional control valves, restores some control over this risk. This
arrangement reduces dead space for each half of the system, and the potential for CO2 rebreathing.
The testing reported here does not include studies of how the arrangement manages CO2.
Mathematical modelling and simulation of both human respiratory and mechanical ventilation
systems is invaluable to help understand novel scenarios such as DPV. Characterising lung
mechanical properties using resistance and compliance has become commonplace. Estimated values
are available from studies such as Arnal et al.9, although other modelling approaches are possible as
reviewed in Carvalho and Zin,10. Complete system models have also been developed as reported in
Wilson et al.,11 and these have been used to extensively study low flow breathing systems12.
However, the aim of our study was to determine if a very simple analytical model can adequately
predict behaviour of a ventilator system. An analytical model permits direct calculation of the flow
restrictor resistance required to achieve a specified tidal volume.
METHODS
A linear lumped resistance-compliance (RC) network model: the BathRC model
A highly simplified lumped resistance-compliance model (Figure 1) can be used to represent single
patient ventilation with four terms: linear resistance (Rv) and compliance (Cv) for the ventilator
tubing system, and linear resistance (R) and compliance (C) for the patient. The inspiration and
expiration phases can be represented with different parameters, resulting in up to eight parameters

per patient. This RC model calculates tidal volume as a function of variations in patient R and C
values. It also gives the relationships between airway flow rate, q, airway pressure, pp, and ventilator
pressure, p (full equations in supplementary information, Appendix A). A DPV-specific use case is to
calculate the required inspiration restriction (Rr) to operate with an increased ventilator pressure
(necessitated by ventilator sharing) without increasing the patient’s tidal volume undesirably.
Experimental measurements are required for model parameter estimation and to validate the
model. The experiments are described below.
Experimental Measurements
Experiments were performed using an Aisys CS2 (Software version 8.0, GE Healthcare, Chicago, USA)
anaesthetic ventilator operated in Pressure Control Mode. This is the most appropriate setting for
DPV, as the settings for a single patient would not need to change for ventilating two identical
patients. In this mode the adjustable settings are:
• Pinsp (the inspiration pressure in excess of PEEP).
• PEEP (Positive end-expiratory pressure), the ventilator pressure during expiration.
• RR (the respiratory rate, breaths per minute).
• I:E (inspiration to expiration time ratio).
In Pressure Control Mode, the ventilator effectively controls the driving pressure to transition
between PEEP and Pinsp+PEEP as quickly as possible at the required switching times; any limits or
triggers which might alter this profile need to be disabled for dual patient use.
The ventilator was connected to a Silverknight 22 mm circle system (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham,
UK) in conjunction with Heat and Moisture Exchange (HME) filters (Clear-Therm 3, Intersurgical Ltd).
Two fixed test lungs (Test Lung 190, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) were used for the
experiments, these were termed Lung 1 and Lung 2. Two Fluke VT Plus HF Gas Flow Analysers (Fluke
Biomedical, Everett, Washington, USA) were used to make flow measurements, and data were
collected by connecting each analyser to a personal computer (Dell XPS13 i5, Dell UK, Bracknell, UK)
running Vent Tester for Windows software (version 2.01.07, Fluke Biomedical). Data were collected
at 50 Hz on each personal computer. Custom functions (MATLAB 2019b, The Mathworks Inc., Natick,
MA, USA) were used to co-register the data collected on the two computers for each experiment.
Figure 2 details three configurations that were used for experimental validation of the model. The
characterisation experiments used single circuit configurations (Figures 2a, Circuit 1, and 2b, Circuit
2) and validation measurements used dual circuit configurations (Figure 2c, Circuit 3). The dual
circuit layout contained four sets of non-return valves (Ref: 1950000, Intersurgical Ltd), also known
as one-way valves to prevent sharing of gas flows and to handle expired CO2 adequately; the
proposed circuit (Figure 2c) used additional non-return valves in each inspiratory and expiratory limb
to stop inspiration or expiration back flows and to reduce each system’s dead space.
Parameter Estimation
Circuit 1 was used to estimate flow resistance parameters for different components. Two types of
restrictor were tested, the first was a non-return valve and the second was a novel flow restrictor
with a very small orifice (11.7 mm2 effective cross-section), hereafter termed small orifice restrictor
or SOR. The SOR device was 3D printed (Form 2, Formlabs Inc., Somerville, MA, USA) for testing
purposes. A minimum of 15 cycles of data were collected at each of three different Pinsp pressures,
5, 15, 25 cmH2O; for all tests PEEP was set to 5 cmH2O, RR was 15 breaths/min, and I:E ratio was 1:2.
The use of the two flow meters in Circuit 1 were used to measure the pressure drop (∆𝑝) across
each tested component. For each flow restrictor, all pressure drop measurements were plotted
against the mean flowrate (Qm), the average of the flowrates measured from the two flowmeters. A
bi-square weighted robust least squares fitting method (Matlab 2019b, The MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA) was used to fit the quadratic function,

∆𝑝 = 𝐾2 𝑄𝑚 2 + 𝐾1 𝑄𝑚 + 𝐾0
This equation becomes linear by setting K2=0, and proportional by additionally setting K0=0. Hence,
the differences between quadratic, linear and constrained (proportional) linear fits were examined.
With a proportional fit, K1 is the resistance value of the component being tested. The BathRC model
formulation can only accommodate the proportional linear representation of a restrictor.
Circuit 2 was used to estimate the compliance and resistance values for both test lungs (each lung
was tested separately). Here, L1=L2=0.4 m to give a total tube length of 2.32 m beyond the flow
meter. The compliance of the tubing itself was estimated using L1=L2=1.52 m, to make the total
length 4.56 m, and replacing the test lung with a blockage at the end of the tube.
For all three tests, at least 15 cycles were again collected at each of three different Pinsp pressures,
5, 15, 25 cmH2O, keeping the values of PEEP, RR and I:E fixed as above.
Validation of BathRC Model
Circuit 3 was used for validation and data were collected for the Pinsp pressures of 15 and 25 cmH2O
(other ventilator settings were fixed). The following five validation tests were conducted with
different flow restrictors connected in the inspiratory limb for Lung 1 (Figure 2c):
1. Pinsp = 25 cmH2O and no restrictor present (replaced by straight connector)
2. Pinsp = 25 cmH2O and non-return valve acting as restrictor
3. Pinsp = 25 cmH2O and SOR device
4. Pinsp = 15 cmH2O and no restrictor present (replaced by straight connector)
5. Pinsp = 15 cmH2O and non-return valve acting as restrictor
The measured values of tidal volume (obtained from the integration of the measured flows) were
compared predictions given by the BathRC model and estimated parameters (as above).
RESULTS
Parameter Estimation
Figure 3 a shows the two linear fits for pressure drop versus mean flowrate (Circuit 1 tests) in the
case of the non-return valve. The corresponding fit data is presented in Table 1, with R2 values of
0.99 and 0.75 for linear and proportional fits, respectively. The data show that this non-return valve
has a cracking pressure of approximately 1 cmH2O. For the SOR, the quadratic and constrained linear
fits are shown in Figure 3 b. The fits (Table 1) result in R2 values of 0.99 and 0.89 for quadratic and
proportional fits, respectively. Resistances for the two devices were estimated from the gradient of
the proportional fits. The non-return valve resistance, Rr, was 12 cmH2O/L/s, and the SOR resistance
was 33 cmH2O/L/s.

Validation of BathRC Model
For validation test 1 (Figure 4 a, top row), without any additional resistance in the inspiratory limb
for Lung 1, the flow was quite similar between the two test lungs. However, the higher compliance
of Lung 1 was reflected in higher peak flow values. For both test lungs the BathRC model predictions
for lung volume change were similar to the measured data (Figure 4 a, middle and bottom rows).
For validation test 2, adding the non-return valve to the inspiratory limb for Lung 1 caused the peak
flows for Lung 1 to be lower than those for Lung 2 (Figure 4 b, top row). Consequently, the tidal
volume was reduced for Lung 1 (Figure 4 b, middle row), with model predictions again closely
tracking the measured data (Figure 4 b, middle and bottom rows). The tidal volume for Lung 1 was
reduced by 22% relative to its unrestricted state.
In validation test 3, restriction in the form of the SOR device further reduced the peak flow values for
Lung 1 (Figure 4 c, top row). For Lung 1, the tidal volume reduction was 36% from its unrestricted
state. For Tests 1 to 3, there was no change in the parameters for Lung 2, so the model predicted
the same tidal volume in each case.
Similarly, when operating at 15 cmH2O Pinsp for validation tests 4 (Figure 4 d, top row) and 5 (Figure
4 e, top row), the effect of adding the non-return valve to provide restriction in test 5 is clearly seen.
In both cases the model predictions matched the measured data well. Lung 1 tidal volume reduces
by 20% as a result of the restriction, again associated with a small increase in Lung 2 tidal volume
(6%).
The measured and predicted values for tidal volumes are given in Table 2 for the validation tests.
The RC model predicts the tidal volumes reasonably well for this range of conditions. For Lung 1, in
the five validation tests the measured tidal volume deviated from the predicted by 2.4%, -3.6%,
3.5%, -5.6% and-9.3%, respectively. For Lung 2, the measured tidal volume deviated from the
predicted by -2.2%, 1.2%, 2.6%, -7.5% and -2.0% respectively. The largest absolute error was 25 mL.

DISCUSSION
To succeed with DPV, we believe it is essential to independently control the gas flow (tidal volume
that each patient receives. A possible solution is to use a flow restrictor in the line of a patient who
would otherwise receive too much pressure or flow, resulting in barotrauma or volutrauma. Such a

restrictor should ideally be adjustable. We have presented experimental results using a pair of test
lungs showing that restricting the flow in one inspiration line does indeed reduce the tidal volume in
the corresponding lung. Moreover, using a linear resistance-compliance network model, we have
shown that the change of tidal volume can be predicted. In the five tests presented, the largest
prediction error was 25 mL of tidal volume. In the form used, the model just needs an airway
resistance and lung compliance estimate for each patient, which is routinely available in a clinical
setting, and a resistance and compliance value for the ventilator tubing system. Likewise, an added
flow restrictor should be characterised by a linear resistance i.e. a pressure drop proportional to
flowrate. The predictions of the model are good despite clear linearization errors for the two flow
restrictors used in this study. All the parameter values used have been informed by individual
component testing.
Some further observations on the results:
1) Non-return valves are used in the individual inspiratory and expiratory limbs of each circle
system (four in total). The valves we used have a considerable resistance, 12 cmH20/(L/s), so
contributing over half of the total flow path resistance (either inspiration or expiration)
estimated to be 22 cmH20/(L/s). While this will mean the characteristics of the dual
arrangement are markedly different from conventional single patient ventilation, the increased
pressure loss within the flow path means that the airway flow and pressure will be less sensitive
to changes in patient characteristics.
2) A result that was not predicted by the simple modelling was that as the flow reduced to one test
lung by the introduction of a flow restrictor, there was a small increase in flow to the other lung.
The most severe flow restrictor reduced tidal volume by 36% in the corresponding lung, but also
increased the tidal volume by 5% in the unaltered loop for the other lung.
A key advantage of the BathRC model is that it is simple to implement and does not require iterative
methods. As such, it can be straightforwardly implemented in a spreadsheet (supplementary
information Appendix B), or as an online calculator. This allows clinicians to estimate the flow
restriction needed to match patient requirements. The challenge remains, however, to source a
flow restrictor which is clinically acceptable, and ideally adjustable. The 3D printed designs that are
emerging need to be proven to be inert, sterilisable, and durable in the breathing system
environment. The fixed restrictor used in this study – in fact a non-return valve – is clinically
approved and provided around 10% differentiation between the two loops. Two or more could be
used in series to provide a greater restriction, but an adjustable flow restrictor would be far easier to
use and would limit the need to break the closed system to add additional resistance should it be
required.
Some other issues which should be investigated are:
1) The effectiveness of the non-return valves in preventing retrograde flows between patients, and
in ensuring unidirectional flow around each circuit, contributing to expired CO2 removal
2) The addition of sensors to give immediate feedback of the effect of flow restriction
3) The ability of a ventilator to maintain the specified pressure when the flow demands have
doubled due to dual ventilation needs to be assured, as is the effectiveness of the CO2 absorber,
although it is anticipated that high gas flows will be used
To reiterate, the APSF have recently recommended that ventilator sharing should not be
undertaken3. Some of the objections raised are addressed in this work. We recognise that no-one
would choose to share a ventilator between two patients, but there may be some situations when
there will be no choice. We also recognise the additional challenge this set-up will present to those
caring for patients in these circumstances. We believe that manageability and safety mandates
limiting the sharing to two patients and not more. Dual patient ventilation is a method of last resort.

APPENDIX A
As shown in Figure 1, the model consists of the patient lung/airway resistance (R) and compliance (C),
and a resistance (Rv) and compliance (Cv) representing the properties of the ventilator tubing system.
The airway flow rate, q, is related to the rate of change in airway pressure pp, according to:
𝑑𝑝𝑝
𝑑𝑞 1
(1)
+ 𝑞=
𝑑𝑡 𝐶
𝑑𝑡
And flow from the ventilator, given by tubing pressure drop divided by resistance, is split between the
patient and what is absorbed by tube compliance (including gas compressibility):
𝑅

𝑝 − 𝑝𝑝
𝑑𝑝𝑝
= 𝑞 + 𝐶𝑣
𝑅𝑣
𝑑𝑡

(2)

Combining equations (1) and (2), the gas volume reaching the patient’s lungs, v, can be related to the
ventilator pressure, p, by:
𝑅𝐶𝑅𝑣 𝐶𝑣

𝑑2 𝑣
𝑑𝑣
+ (𝑅𝐶 + 𝑅𝑣 𝐶𝑣 + 𝑅𝑣 𝐶)
+ 𝑣 = 𝐶𝑝
2
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡

(3)

Physically realistic parameter values lead to a very small second derivative term, so:
𝑑𝑣
(4)
+ 𝑣 ≈ 𝐶𝑝
𝑑𝑡
Due to ventilator or patient properties, the inspiration and expiration parameters may be different.
Therefore, the first order response represented by (2) may have different inspiration and expiration
time constants, given by:
𝜏𝑖 = 𝑅𝑖 𝐶𝑖 + 𝑅𝑣𝑖 (𝐶𝑣𝑖 + 𝐶𝑖 )
(5)
(𝑅𝐶 + 𝑅𝑣 𝐶𝑣 + 𝑅𝑣 𝐶)

𝜏𝑒 = 𝑅𝑒 𝐶𝑒 + 𝑅𝑣𝑒 (𝐶𝑣𝑒 + 𝐶𝑒 )
In pressure control, the ventilator pressure p approximates a series of square pulses. The lung
volume during inspiration at time t, in addition to the Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) of the
patient’s lungs, is given by:
(6)
𝑣(𝑡) = 𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 − (𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 − 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 )𝑒 −𝑡⁄𝜏𝑖 for 0 ≤ 𝑡 < 𝑇𝑠
where Viss is the steady state asymptote of the inspiration phase, Vmin is the minimum volume, which
occurs at the start of inspiration, and Ts is the time at which the ventilator switches from high to low
pressure (Figure A1). During expiration the volume is given by:
(7)
𝑣(𝑡) = 𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑠 + (𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑠 )𝑒 −(𝑡−𝑇𝑠 )⁄𝜏𝑒 for 𝑇𝑠 ≤ 𝑡 < 𝑇
where Vess is the steady state asymptote of the expiration phase, Vmax is the maximum volume, which
occurs at the start of expiration, and T is the period for the full breathing cycle. These functions are
illustrated in Figure A1.
The steady state volumes are given by the product of compliance and pressure:
𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 = 𝐶𝑖 𝑃𝑖 and 𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑠 = 𝐶𝑒 𝑃𝑒

(8)

where Pe is the low pressure setting of the ventilator (PEEP), and Pi
is the high pressure used for inspiration.
Maximum volume is reach at the end of inspiration, i.e. at t = Ts, and minimum volume is reached at
the end of expiration, i.e. at t = T, so (6) and (7) can be written at these particular times as:

𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 − (𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 − 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 )𝑒 −𝑇𝑠 ⁄𝜏𝑖

(9)

𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑠 + (𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑠 )𝑒 −(𝑇−𝑇𝑠 )⁄𝜏𝑒

(10)

Define the following coefficients:
𝑎 = 𝐶𝑖 (1 − 𝑏)

(11)

𝑏 = 𝑒 −𝑇𝑠 ⁄𝜏𝑖

(12)

𝑐 = 𝐶𝑒 (1 − 𝑑)

(13)

𝑑 = 𝑒 −(𝑇−𝑇𝑠)⁄𝜏𝑒

(14)

Figure A1. Lung volume waveform variable definitions
Thus the minimum and maximum volumes are related to the ventilator pressures by:
𝑃
𝑉
[ 𝑖 ] = 𝐊 [ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ]
𝑃𝑒
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
1 −𝑏
𝑎 ]
𝐊=[ 𝑎
−𝑑 1

So the maximum and minimum volume and tidal volume (VT) can be calculated:
𝑉
𝑃
[ 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ] = 𝐊 −𝟏 [ 𝑖 ]
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑃𝑒

(15)
(16)

(17)

𝑉𝑇 = 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛

(18)

𝑎𝑃𝑖 + 𝑏𝑐𝑃𝑒
1 − 𝑏𝑑
𝑎𝑑𝑃𝑖 + 𝑐𝑃𝑒
=
1 − 𝑏𝑑

(19)

Equation (17) is equivalent to:
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 =
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛

Calculating inspiration restrictor resistance
The resistance required to achieve a specified tidal volume 𝑉̃𝑇 can be found. From (10), (14), and
(18):
(20)
𝑉̃𝑇 + (1 − 𝑑)𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑠
𝑉̃𝑚𝑎𝑥 =
1−𝑑
Hence 𝑉̃𝑚𝑖𝑛 can be found from (18), and the new inspiration time constant can be found from (9):
(21)
𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 − 𝑉̃𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝜏̃ 𝑖 = −𝑇𝑠 /𝑙𝑛 (
)
𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑠 − 𝑉̃𝑚𝑖𝑛
From (5), the additional resistance, 𝑅𝑟 , in the inspiration line can be found:

𝑅𝑟 =

𝜏̃ 𝑖 − 𝑅𝑖 𝐶𝑖
− 𝑅𝑣𝑖
𝐶𝑣𝑖 + 𝐶𝑖

(22)

Alternatively, if the original tidal volume is required to be maintained but with an increased
ventilator pressure Pi, equation (21) can be used with a new value for the end-inspiratory steady
state volume Viss given by (8), and (22) can be again used to find the restrictor resistance for the new
inspiratory time constant.
As this model does not need a time-marching numerical solution, results can be determined by
calculations in, for example, a spreadsheet. A view of such an implementation is given in Appendix
B.
