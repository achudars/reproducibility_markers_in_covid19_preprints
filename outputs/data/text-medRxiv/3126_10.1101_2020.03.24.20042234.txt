We present here the design of the Mechanical Ventilator Milano (MVM), a novel mechanical ventilator designed for mass scale production in response to the COVID-19 pandemics,
to compensate for the dramatic shortage of such ventilators in many countries. This ventilator is an electro-mechanical equivalent of the old, reliable Manley Ventilator. Our design
is optimized to permit large sale production in short time and at a limited cost, relying on
off-the-shelf components, readily available worldwide from hardware suppliers. Operation
of the MVM requires only a source of compressed oxygen (or compressed medical air) and
electrical power. The MVM control and monitoring unit can be connected and networked
via WiFi so that no additional electrical connections are necessary other than the connection
to the electrical power.
At this stage the MVM is not a certified medical device. Construction of the first prototypes is starting with a team of engineers, scientists and computing experts. The purpose of
this paper is to disseminate the conceptual design of the MVM broadly and to solicit feedback from the scientific and medical community to speed the process of review, improvement
and possible implementation.
1.

INTRODUCTION

The current COVID-19 pandemic [1] is causing a rapidly increasing number of SARS-CoV-2
[2] pathologies all across the world. A common
outcome of SARS-CoV-2 is severe pneumonia [3].
Effective medical intervention in this pathology
involves the use of mechanical ventilation [3–5].
In order to meet the needs of the increasingly
large number of patients in the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid deployment of a large number of
new mechanical ventilators [6] will be required.

These devices must be capable of being mass produced rapidly and at large scale.
There are substantially two different modalities of mechanical ventilation [7]:
Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP):
a ventilation mode where “the pressure in the
lungs (alveolar pressure)” at the end of the
expiratory cycle is maintained “above atmospheric pressure (the pressure outside of the
body)” [8]. “The two types of PEEP are extrinsic PEEP (PEEP applied by a ventilator)
and intrinsic PEEP (PEEP caused by an in-

complete exhalation). Pressure that is applied
or increased during an inspiration is termed
pressure support” [8];
Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV): “a
spontaneous mode of ventilation. The patient
initiates each breath and the ventilator delivers
support with the preset pressure value. With
support from the ventilator, the patient also
regulates his own respiratory rate and tidal
volume” [9]. See also Ref. [10] for additional
information.
The imperative need to treat a large number of
patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 has motivated
the consideration of a reliable, fail-safe, and easy
to operate mechanical ventilator that can be produced quickly on a massive scale. We introduce
a novel mechanical ventilator (Mechanical Ventilator Milano, MVM), inspired by the Manley
ventilator [11]. In 1961, Roger Manley “suggested the possibility of using the pressure of the
gases from the anaesthetic machine as the motive power for a simple apparatus to ventilate
the lungs of the patients in the operating theatre” [12]. We have tried to design the MVM
with the same principle of simplicity in mind.
The main difference is the use of electricallydriven pneumatic valves instead of mechanical
switches to ease large scale production. The
MVM does not include a system to measure the
tidal volume provided to the patient with each
breathing cycle, but rather a system to mea-

sure the peak and average expiratory flow rate.
The MVM adheres as much as possible to the
guidelines for “Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator
System (RMVS)” [13] recently released by the
UK Medicine & Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency.
The MVM delivers to patients PEEP mechanical ventilation, reaching a pressure in the
range 20 mbarg to 30 mbarg (1 mbarg is the atmospheric pressure plus a pressure given by a
H2 O column of 1 cm of height) at the end of
inspiration and an end-expiratory pressure of
approximately 5 mbarg. The MVM can operate
in either an independent or in assisted mode,
described later in Sec. 3.
The main characteristics of the MVM are:
Simplicity of Operation: the MVM connects
directly to a line of pressurized medical oxygen
(or medical air), and relies on simple regulation of the upstream flow to deliver oxygen to
the patient at a pressure in the range 20 mbarg
to 30 mbarg/cm H2 O . Pressure regulation of
the end-expiratory cycle is achieved by discharging the expiratory flow in a simple vent
trap, which sets the desired minimum expiratory pressure precisely at 5 mbarg/cm H2 O.
Another vent trap connected to the line delivering oxygen to the patient ensures that the
maximum pressure delivered does not exceed
30 mbarg. The construction of both vent traps
with transparent plastic containers permits to

doctors and nurses a direct visual monitoring
of the inspiratory pressure and of the expiratory flow;
Small Number of Components: the MVM
consist of a medical care flowmeter [14] in
use for direct regulation of the maximum
flow rate, a oxygen-therapy humidifier [14],
a non-vented non invasive ventilation (NIV)
mask [15], two electrically-controlled, VDCactuated pneumatic valves, a pressure sensor,
a control system directly connected to the
pneumatic valves and to the control sensor,
and a backup VDC battery connected to the
control system;
Ease of Procurement: the parts required for
the construction of the MVM have been selected by investigating current inventories
available worldwide at major resellers of hardware suppliers. The parts selected are also
characterized by their ease of mass-scale manufacturing;
Ease of Construction: assembly of the parts
into a complete MVM can be completed with
a set of limited and clear instructions. The
process for loading the software into the controller is simple. The controller software is
open source and available for customizations
by end users;
Cost Containment: the total cost of components is a few hundreds of e ’s.
Ease of Deployment: the only required facilities are a line of pressurized oxygen and
standard AC electric power (either 220 V or
110 V). The MVM can be deployed wherever
a source of pressurized oxygen can be made
available. It is suitable for home care and
for use in ambulances. It is convenient to deploy in care clinics with centralized oxygen
supply systems, such as COVID hospitals or
COVID-care areas in general hospitals;
Customizability: the MVM can operate in different configurations (independent and patient
assisted) as described in Section 3. The operating parameters can be tuned by the operator
with a simple user interface;
Scalability: the MVM control system is based
an a WiFi micro-controller which allows to
monitor and tune the parameters of multiple
units with a single work station;
Reliability: all the components in this units
are commercial and readily available. The reliability of MVM has to be carefully studied
based on the specifications of the components.

The system is designed to be simple, cheap
and easily reparable, just by replacing the nonfunctional parts.

2.

DESIGN AND COMPONENTS

The conceptual design and P&ID of the MVM
are shown in Fig.1. The main components are
described following the order of the oxygen flow:
Connection to oxygen supply: at the left
end side, the MVM is connected to a pressurized oxygen line.
Medical care flowmeter MCF1: The oxygen flow is controlled by medical care flowmeter MCF1, which restricts the flow to a maximum value. In case of the need to administer
a mix of oxygen and air, MCF1 can be an
oxygen/air mixing medical care flowmeter.
Oxygen delivery pneumatic valve PV1:
The incoming oxygen flow is controlled by
pneumatic valve PV1. We have verified that
an orifice with diameter of 6 mm is sufficient
to guarantee that a proper respiratory minute
volume is delivered to the patient;
Humidifier OTH1: the incoming oxygen flow
is humidified before reaching the patient by
entering the oxygen therapy humidifier OTH1;
Vent trap VT1: vent trap VT1 is filled with a
vertical column of oil, which raises the minimum vent pressure to a value of approximately
30 mbarg. The value of the minimum vent
pressure can be easily adjusted in the neighborhood of 30 mbarg by varying the oil level or
by adjusting the vertical position of the tube
reaching below the oil surface. The vent line
connects directly to the atmosphere, guaranteeing that the pressure differential delivered
to the patient does not exceed the preset minimum vent pressure of VT1;
Nasal or oronasal mask: from OTH1, the incoming humidified oxygen flow is delivered to
the patient outfitted with a non-vented NIV
mask.
Breathing system: the NIV mask is connected
to a breathing system, supporting the attachment of two plastic tubes of typical size 22 mm
connecting respectively to pneumatic valves
PV1 and PV2, and to a smaller plastic tube
leading to pressure sensor PS1. The standard
for connection of the breathing system is the
22 mm cone and socket combination defined
in the publication “ISO 5356-1:2015 - Anaes3

thetic and respiratory equipment — Conical
connectors — Part 1: Cones and sockets” [16].
Oxygen line: the oxygen line from OTH1 to
the patient is branched into a line connected
to vent trap VT1;
Expiration pneumatic valve PV2: PV2 controls the expiratory flow. As for PV1, a valve
orifice with diameter of 6 mm is sufficient to
guarantee the flow corresponding to the expiration of a proper respiratory minute volume;
Vent trap VT2: vent trap VT2 is filled with a
vertical column of liquid, which raises the minimum vent pressure to the value of 5 mbarg;
Spirometer SP1: a portable digital spirometer can be connected to the vent line of vent
trap VT2 to monitor the peak and average expiratory flow rate. We are also investigating
the possibility to integrate the spirometer in
the main control unit, shifting its installation
point so that it is directly connected to the
downstream port of PV2;
Note on VT1 and VT2: both those liquid
based vent traps act as adjustable pressure
relief valves where the pressure level can be
monitored. They could be replaced by mechanical pressure relief valves set at fixed values of 30 and 5 mbarg respectively. They are
very compact objects available on the market,
the only drawback being the pressure in the
ventilation line cannot be monitored.

3.

CONTROL SYSTEM AND
OPERATION

The control system performs supervision and
actuation of the two valves based on the programmed respiratory cycle.
The respiratory cycle is operated by actuating pneumatic valves PV1 and PV2. During
the inspiratory phase, PV2 is closed and PV1
is open. At the end of the inspiratory cycle, the
pressure reaches the design range of 20 mbarg to
30 mbarg. At the end of the inspiratory cycle,
PV1 is closed and PV2 is opened simultaneously,
allowing the discharge of the lungs pressure. The
end-expiratory pressure is set by the height of the
liquid column in vent trap VT1.
Pressure sensor PS1 reads directly the pressure at the mask of the patient and permits the
control system to verify and ensure that the pressure is always within the operating range by operating the relative valves: 20 mbarg to 30 mbarg

for the inspiration phase and 5 mbarg for the
end-expiratory phase.
The main controller runs on a (Arduinocompatible) micro-controller board based on
a 32 bit micro-controller with WiFi/Bluetooth
connectivity. All boards of this type have a
small form factor and integrates all I/O function
required for this project.
A daughter board interfaces to the controller
and provides four opto-coupled switches to operate the electrically-controlled pneumatic valves.
The daughter board is provided with 24 V VDC
supply and includes the low voltage regulator to
supply the central unit.
The differential pressure gauges are based on
a 60 mbar differential pressure sensor with a resolution better than 0.2 mbar.
The WiFi connectivity of the board the unit
offers the option for central monitoring and configuration. A buzzer and a high luminosity LED
are available to signal the operators in case of
alarms.
The software operating the breathing cycles
will be defined in conjunction with medical doctors involved in the development of the units,
and will allow operation in independent or assisted configuration. In its independent configuration the unit will operate the valves at fixed
cycles as configured by the operator. In its assisted configuration, the cycles will be defined
by a feedback system that will detect the incipient movement of the thoracic cage by monitoring with high precision the pressure at the mask
through pressure sensor PS1. Upon detecting
the incipient movement of the thoracic cage, the
MVM will trigger the assisted PEEP breathing
cycle movement.
The MVM is equipped with an industrial
power supply unit capable for at least 50 W
and battery backup operated in fail-safe mode.
Under normal circumstances the power supply
will feed the controller and keep the battery
charged. In case of power failure the battery will
automatically intervene and provide the current
to operate the system for an interval not in excess of 30 min. The power supply is hosted in a
separate enclosure to provide isolation between
the oxygen lines and possible spark sources. The
power supply unit will include two 12 V, 1.2 A h
batteries.
