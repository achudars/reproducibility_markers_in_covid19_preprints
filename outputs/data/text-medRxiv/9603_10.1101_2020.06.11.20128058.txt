Power Laws in Superspreading Events:
Evidence from Coronavirus Outbreaks and Implications for SIR Models

June 11, 2020

Abstract
While they are rare, superspreading events (SSEs), wherein a few primary cases infect an
extraordinarily large number of secondary cases, are recognized as a prominent determinant
of aggregate infection rates (R0 ). Existing stochastic SIR models incorporate SSEs by fitting
distributions with thin tails, or finite variance, and therefore predicting almost deterministic
epidemiological outcomes in large populations. This paper documents evidence from recent
coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, that SSEs follow a power
law distribution with fat tails, or infinite variance. We then extend an otherwise standard
SIR model with the estimated power law distributions, and show that idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs will lead to large aggregate uncertainties in infection dynamics, even with
large populations. That is, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks will be unpredictable.
While such uncertainties have social costs, we also find that they on average decrease the
herd immunity thresholds and the cumulative infections because per-period infection rates
have decreasing marginal effects. Our findings have implications for social distancing interventions: targeting SSEs reduces not only the average rate of infection (R0 ) but also its
uncertainty. To understand this effect, and to improve inference of the average reproduction
numbers under fat tails, estimating the tail distribution of SSEs is vital.

1 Introduction
On March 10th, 2020, choir members were gathered for their rehearsal in Washington. While
they were all cautious to keep distance from one another and nobody was coughing, three
weeks later, 52 members had COVID-19, and two passed away. There are numerous similar
anecdotes worldwide.1 Many studies have shown that the average basic reproduction number (R0 ) is around 2.5-3 for this coronavirus (e.g. Liu et al., 2020), but 75% of infected cases do
not pass on to any others (Nishiura et al., 2020). The superspreading events (SSEs), wherein a
few primary cases infect an extraordinarily large number of others, are responsible for the high
average number. As SSEs were also prominent in SARS and MERS before COVID-19, epidemiology research has long sought to understand them (e.g. Shen et al., 2004). In particular, various
parametric distributions of infection rates have been proposed, and their variances have been
estimated in many epidemics under an assumption that they exist (e.g. Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005).
On the other hand, stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models have shown that,
as long as the infected population is moderately large, the idiosyncratic uncertainties of SSEs
will cancel out each other. That is, following the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), stochastic models quickly converge to their deterministic counterparts, and become largely predictable. From
this perspective, the dispersion of SSEs is unimportant in itself, but is useful only to the extent
it can help target lockdown policies to focus on SSEs to efficiently reduce the average rates R0
(Endo et al., 2020).
In this paper, we extend this research by closely examining the distribution of infection rates,
and rethinking how its dispersion influences the uncertainties of aggregate dynamics. Using
evidence from the several coronavirus outbreaks, we show that SSEs follow a power law, or
Pareto, distribution with fat tails, or infinite variance. That is, the true variance of infection rates
cannot be empirically estimated as any estimate will be an underestimate however large it may
be. When the CLT assumption of finite variance does not hold, many theoretical and statistical
implications of epidemiology models will require rethinking. Theoretically, even when the
infected population is large, the idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs will persist and lead to large
aggregate uncertainties. Statistically, the standard estimate of the average reproduction number
(R0 ) may be far from its true mean, and the standard errors will understate the true uncertainty.
Because the infected population for COVID-19 is already large, our findings have immediate
implications for statistical inference and current policy.
We begin with evidence. Figure 1 plots the largest clusters reported worldwide for COVID19 from data gathered by Leclerc et al. (2020). If a random variable follows a power law distribution with an exponent α, then the log of its scale (e.g. a US navy vessel had 1,156 cases tested
positive) and the log of its severity rank (e.g. that navy case ranked 1st in severity) will have
a linear relationship, with its slope indicating −α. Figure 1 shows a fine fit of the power law

distribution (R2 = 0.98).2 Moreover, the slope is very close to 1, indicating a significant fatness
of the tail to the extent that is analogous to natural disasters such as earthquakes (Gutenberg
and Richter, 1954) that are infrequent but can be extreme. While data collection through media
reports may be biased towards extreme cases, analogous relationships hold for SARS, MERS,
and COVID-19 data based on surveillance data, with exponents often indicating fat tails. Note
that other distributions, including the negative binomial distributions commonly applied in
epidemiology research, cannot predict these relationships, and significantly underestimate the
risks of extremely severe SSEs.
Using estimated power law distributions, we show that stochastic SIR models predict sub2 In

and Ibragimov (2011), which shows the exponent is 1.16, and the R2 is 0.98. With maximum likelihood estimation,
the exponent is 1.01.

stantial uncertainties in aggregate epidemiological outcomes. Concretely, we consider a stochastic model with a population of one million, whereby a thousand people are initially infected,
and apply epidemiological parameters adopted from the literature. We consider effects of tails
of distribution while keeping the average rate (R0 ) constant. Under thin-tailed distributions,
such as the estimated negative binomial distribution or power law distribution with α = 2, the
epidemiological outcomes will be essentially predictable. However, under fat-tailed distributions as estimated in the COVID-19 data worldwide (α = 1.1), there will be immense variations
in all outcomes. For example, the peak infection rate is on average 19%, but its 90the percentile
is 34% while its 10th percentile is 10%. Under thin-tailed distribution such as negative binomial distribution, the average, 90th percentile and 10th percentile of the peak infection is all
concentrated at 27%, generating almost deterministic outcomes.
While our primary focus was on the effect on aggregate uncertainty, we also find important effects on average outcomes. In particular, under a fat-tailed distribution, the cumulative
and peak infection, as well as the herd immunity threshold, will be lower, and the timing of
outbreak will come later than those under a thin-tailed distribution, on average. For example,
the average herd immunity threshold is 65 percent with thin-tailed distribution, it is 47% with
fat-tailed distribution. These observations suggest that the increase in aggregate uncertainty
over R0 has effects analogous to a decrease in average R0 . This relationship arises because the
average future infection will be a concave function of today’s infection rate: because of concavity, mean preserving spread will lower the average level. In particular, today’s higher infection
rate has two countering effects: while it increases the future infection, it also decreases the
susceptible population, which decreases it. We provide theoretical interpretations for each outcome by examining the effect of mean-preserving spread of R0 in analytical results derived in
deterministic models.
Our findings have critical implications for the design of lockdown policies to minimize the
social costs of infection. Here, we study lockdown policies that target SSEs. We assume that
the maximum size of infection rate can be limited to the top 5 percent with some probabilities
by banning large gatherings. Because both the uncertainty and mean of the infection rate in
the fat-tailed distribution are driven by the tail events, such policies substantially lower the
uncertainty and improve the average outcomes. Because the cost of such policy3 is difficult
to estimate reliably, we do not compute the cost-effectiveness of such policy. Nonetheless, we
believe this is an important consideration in the current debates on how to re-open the economy
while mitigating the uncertainties of subsequent waves.
Finally, we also show the implications of a fat-tailed distributions for the estimation of the
average infection rate. Under such a distribution with small sample sizes, the sample mean
yields estimates that are far from the true mean and standard errors that are too small. To address such possibility, it will be helpful to estimate the power law exponent. If the estimate

indicates a thin-tailed distribution, then one can be confident with the sample mean estimate. If
it indicates a fat-tailed distribution, then one must be aware that there is much uncertainty in the
estimate not captured by its confidence interval. While such fat-tailed distributions cause notoriously difficult estimation problems, we explore a "plug-in" method that uses the estimated
exponent. Such estimators generate median estimates closer to the true mean with adequate
confidence intervals that reflect the substantial risk of SSEs.
Related Literature. First, our paper belongs to a large literature on stochastic epidemiological models. The deterministic SIR model was initiated by Kermack and McKendrick (1927),
and later, Bartlett (1949) and Kendall (1956) developed stochastic SIR models (see Britton (2010,
2018) for surveys). The traditional view of the stochastic SIR model is that while useful when
the number of infected is small, once the infected population is moderately large, it behaves
similarly to the deterministic model due to the CLT. Britton (2010) writes “Once a large number
of individuals have been infected, the epidemic process may be approximated by the deterministic counter-part.” There are recent applications of stochastic SIR models that study the very
beginning of COVID-19 outbreaks (for example, Abbott et al. (2020), Karako et al. (2020), Simha
et al. (2020) and Bardina et al. (2020)). However, the major modeling effort has been to use
deterministic models based on the common justification above. Our point is that when the distribution is fat-tailed, which we found an empirical support for, the CLT no longer applies, and
hence the stochastic model behaves qualitatively differently from its deterministic counterpart
even with a large number of infected individuals.
Second, the empirical importance of SSEs is widely recognized in the epidemiological literature before COVID-19 (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Galvani and May, 2005) and for COVID-19
(Frieden and Lee, 2020; Endo et al., 2020). These papers fit the parametric distribution that is by
construction thin-tailed, such as negative binomial distribution. It has been common to estimate
“the dispersion parameter k” of the negative binomial distribution. We argue that the fat-tailed
distribution provides a better fit to the empirical distribution of SSEs, in which a tail parameter, α, parsimoniously captures the thickness of the tail. A recent contribution by Cooper et al.
(2019) consider Pareto rule in the context of malaria transmission, but they nonetheless estimate
the dispersion with finite variance for the entire infections.
Third, our paper also relates to studies that incorporate heterogeneity into SIR models, incorporating differences in individual characteristics or community structures. Several recent
papers point out that the permanent heterogeneity in individual infection rates lower the herd
immunity threshold (Gomes et al., 2020; Hébert-Dufresne et al., 2020; Britton et al., 2020). Although we obtain a similar result, our underlying mechanisms are distinct from theirs. In our
model, there is no ex-ante heterogeneity across individuals, and thus their mechanism is not
present. Instead, what matters for us is the aggregate fluctuations in R0 , which their models do
not exhibit. Some recent papers emphasize the importance of age-dependent heterogeneity and

its implications for lockdown policies (Acemoglu et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2020; Gollier, 2020;
Rampini, 2020; Glover et al., 2020; Brotherhood et al., 2020). We emphasize another dimension
of targeting: targeting toward large social gatherings, and this policy reduces the uncertainty
regarding various epidemiological outcomes. Another related paper is Beare and Toda (2020).
They document that the cumulative number of infected population across cities and countries
is closely approximated by a power law distribution. They then argue that the standard SIR
model is able to explain the fact. We document that the infection at the individual level follows
a power law.
Finally, it is well-known that many variables follow a power law distribution. These include
the city size (Zipf, 1949), the firm size (Axtell, 2001), income (Atkinson et al., 2011), wealth
(Kleiber and Kotz, 2003), consumption (Toda and Walsh, 2015) and even the size of the earthquakes (Gutenberg and Richter, 1954), the moon craters and solar flares (Newman, 2005). Regarding COVID-19, Beare and Toda (2020) document that the cumulative number of infected
population across cities and countries is closely approximated by a power law distribution.
They then argue that the standard SIR model is able to explain the fact. We document that the
infection at the individual level follows a power law. We are also partly inspired by economics
literature which argue that the fat-tailed distribution in firm-size has an important consequence
for the macroeconomics dynamics, originated by Gabaix (2011). We follow the similar route in
documenting that the SSEs are well approximated by a power law distribution and arguing that
such empirical regularities have important consequences for the epidemiological dynamics.
Roadmap. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 documents evidence that
the distribution of SSEs follows power law. Section 3 embed the evidence into an otherwise
standard SIR models to demonstrate its implications for the epidemiological dynamics. Section 4 studies estimation of the reproduction numbers under fat-tailed distribution. Section 5
concludes by discussing what our results imply for ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Evidence

We present evidence from SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 that the SSEs follow power law distributions. Moreover, our estimates suggest the distributions are often fat-tailed, with critical
implications for the probabilities of extreme SSEs. Evidence also suggests a potential role of
policies in reducing the tail distributions.

at time t. Then, given some threshold Z, an individual i is said to have caused SSE at time t if
zit ≥ Z . To make the estimation flexible, suppose the distribution for non-SSEs, zit < Z, needs
not follow the same distribution as those for SSEs.
In this paper, we consider a power law (or Pareto) distribution on the distribution of SSE.
Denoting its exponent by α, the countercumulative distribution is

for Z ≥ Z,

ficiently low: while its mean is α−
1 Z if α > 1, it is ∞ if α ≤ 1. While its variance is (α−1)2 (α−2) Z
if α > 2, it is ∞ if α ≤ 2. In this paper, we formally call a distribution to be fat-tailed if α < 2 so
that they have infinite variance. While non-existence of mean and variance may appear pathological, a number of socioeconomic and natural phenomenon such as city sizes (α ≈ 1), income
(α ≈ 2), and earthquake energy (α ≈ 1) have tails well-approximated by this distribution as
reviewed in the Introduction. A theoretical reason why this distribution could be relevant for
airborne diseases is that the number of connections in social networks often follow a power law
(Barabasi and Frangos, 2014).
This characteristics stands in contrast with the standard assumption in epidemiology literature that the full distribution of zit follows a negative binomial (or Pascal) distribution4 with
finite mean and variance. The negative binomial distribution has been estimated to fit the data
better than Poisson or geometric distribution for SARS (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005), and given its
theoretical bases from branching model (e.g. Gay et al., 2004), it has been a standard distributional assumption in the epidemiology literature (e.g. Nishiura et al., 2017).

2.2 Data
This paper uses five datasets of recent coronavirus outbreaks for examining the distribution of
SSEs: COVID-19 data from (i) across the world, (ii) Japan, and (iii) India, and (iv) SARS data,
(v) MERS data.
(i) COVID-19 data from around the world: this dataset contains clusters of infections found
by a systematic review of academic articles and media reports, conducted by the Centre of the
Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working Group (Leclerc et al., 2020).
The data are restricted to first generation of cases, and do not include subsequent cases from

the infections. The data are continuously updated, and in this draft, we have used the data
downloaded on June 3rd. There were a total of 227 clusters recorded.
(ii) COVID-19 data from Japan: this dataset contains a number of secondary cases of 110
COVID-19 patients across 11 clusters in Japan until February 26th, 2020, reported in Nishiura
et al. (2020). This survey was commissioned by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of
Japan to identify high risk transmission cases.
(iii) COVID-19 data from India: this dataset contains the state-level data collected by the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and individual data collected by covid19india.org.5 We
use the data downloaded on May 31st.
(iv) SARS from around the world: this dataset contains 15 incidents of SSEs from SARS
in 2003 that occured in Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore, and Toronto, as gathered by LloydSmith et al. (2005)6 through a review of 6 papers. The rate of community transmission was
not generally high so that, for example, the infections with unknown route were only about
10 percent in the case of Beijing. The data consist of SSEs, defined by epidemiologists (Shen
et al., 2004) as the cases with more than 8 secondary cases. For Singapore and Beijing, the
contact-tracing data is available from Hsu et al. (2003) and Shen et al. (2004), respectively. When
compare the fit to the negative binomial distribution, we compare the fit of power law to that
of negative binomial using these contact tracing data.
(v) MERS from around the world: this dataset contains MERS clusters reported up to August 31, 2013. The cases are classified as clusters when thee are linked epidemiologically. The
data come from three published studies were used in Kucharski and Althaus (2015). Total of
116 clusters are recorded.
We use multiple data sets in order to examine the robustness of findings.7 Having multiple
data sets can address each other’s weaknesses in data. While data based on media reports is
broad, they may be skewed to capture extreme events; in contrast, data based on contact tracing
may be reliable, but are restricted to small population. By using both, we can complement each
data’s weaknesses.

2.3 Estimation
The datasets report cumulative number of secondary cases, either ∑i zit (when a particular
event may have had multiple primary cases) or ∑t zit (when an individual infects many oth5 https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india.

They have some differences in terms of transmissibility, severity, fatality, and vulnerable groups (Petrosillo et al.,

ers through multiple events over time). Denoting these cumulative numbers by Z, we consider
this distribution for some Z ≥ Z ∗ . As discussed in Appendix A.1, we can interpret the estimates of this tail distribution as approximately the per-period and individual tail distribution
and therefore map directly to the parameter of the SIR model in the next section. The thresholds
for inclusion, Z ∗ , will be chosen to match the threshold for SSEs when possible, but also adjust
for the sample size. For COVID-19 in the world, we apply Z = 40 to focus on the tail of the
SSE distribution. For SARS, we apply Z = 8 as formally defined (Shen et al., 2004). For other
samples, we apply Z = 2 because the sample size is limited.
To assess whether the distribution of Z follows the power law, we adopt the regressionbased approach that is transparent and commonly used. If Z follows power law distribution, then by (1), the log of Z and the log of its underlying rank have a linear relationship:
log rank( Z ) = −α log Z + log( NπZ α ). This is because, when there are N individuals, the expected ranking of a realized value Z is Erank ( Z ) ' P(z ≥ Z ) N for moderately large N. Thus,
when N is large, we obtain a consistent estimate of α by the following regression:
log rank ( Z ) = −α log Z + log( NπZ α ) + ε

(2)

When N is not large, however, the estimate will exhibit a downward bias because log is a concave function and thus E log rank ( Z ) < log Erank ( Z ). While we present the analysis according
to (2) in Figures 1 and 2 for expositional clarity, we also report the estimates with small sample
bias correction proposed by Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) in Appendix A.2.2.8 We also estimate using the maximum likelihood in Appendix A.2.2. Note that when there are ties (e.g.
second and third largest had 10 infections), we assigned different values to each observation
(e.g. assigning rank of 2 and 3 to each observation).
Next, we also compare the extent to which a power law distribution can approximate the
distribution of SSEs adequately relative to the negative binomial distribution. First, we plot
what the predicted log-log relationship in (2) would be given the estimated parameters of negative binomial distribution.9 Second, to quantify the predictive accuracy, we compute the ratio
of likelihood of observing the actual data.

i
h
approach is to turn the dependent variable into log rank( Z ) − 12 instead of log [rank( Z )]. We examine
the performance of their bias correction method through a estimating regression given random variables generated
from power law distributions. While their bias correction almost eliminates bias when N is moderately large, it
has an upward bias of α whereas the equation (2) has a downward bias. The magnitude of bias is similar when
N = 10 or N = 15. Thus, our preferred approach is to refer to both methods for robustness.
9 This approach stands in contrast with a common practice to plot the probability mass functions. Unlike such
approaches where differences in tail densities are invisible since it is very close to zero, this approach highlights
the differences in tail densities.

Results

Our analysis shows that the power law finely approximates the distribution of SSEs. Figure 1
visualizes this for COVID-19 from across the world, and Figure 2 for SARS, MERS, and COVID19 in Japan and India. Their R2 range between 0.93 and 0.99, suggesting high levels of fit to the
data. Because our focus is on upper-tail distribution, Figure 1 truncates below at the cluster
size 40, Figure 2 truncates at 8 for SARS and at 2 for MERS and COVID-19 in India and Japan.
Figure A.1 in Appendix presents a version of Figure 1 truncated below at 20.
In addition, the estimates of regression (2) suggest that the power law exponent, α, is below
2 and even close to 1. Table 1 summarizes the main findings. The estimated exponents near
1 suggest that extreme SSEs are not uncommon. For COVID-19 in Japan and India, the estimated exponents are larger than 1 but often below 2. Since applying the threshold of Z ∗ = 2
is arguably too low, we must interpret out-of-sample extrapolation from these estimates with
caution. When higher thresholds are applied, the estimated exponents tend to be higher. For
example, when applying the threshold of Z ∗ = 8 as in SARS 2003 to COVID-19 in India, the
estimated exponent is 1.85 or 2.25. This pattern is already visible in Figure 2. Table A.1 in Appendix A.2.2 presents results using bias correction technique of Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011)
as well as maximum likelihood. The results are very similar.
Notably, the estimated exponent of India is higher than those of other data. There are two
possible explanations. First, the lockdown policies in India have been implemented strictly rel10

Figure 3: Comparison of power law and negative binomial distributions
Notes: Figure 3 plots the predicted ranking of infection cases given the estimated negative binomial
(NB) distribution, in addition to the log-log plots and estimated power law (PL) distributions. The
negative binomial distribution is parameterized by ( R, k ), where R is mean and k is the dispersion
parameter with the variance being R(1 + R/k). The estimates for SARS Singapore come from our own
estimates using the maximum likelihood (R = 0.88, k = 0.09); MERS come from the world (R =
0.47, k = 0.26) estimated in Kucharski and Althaus (2015); and COVID-19 in Japan were from our own
estimates using the maximum likelihood (R = 0.56, k = 0.21). The estimates of Singapore is slightly
different from Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005) because we pool all the samples.

ative to moderate approaches in Japan and some other parts of the world during the outbreaks.
By discouraging and prohibiting large-scale gatherings, sometimes by police enforcement, they
may have been successful at targeting SSEs. Second, contact tracing to ensure data reliability
may have been more difficult in India until end of May than in Japan until end of February.10
While missing values will not generate any biases if the attritions were proportional to the number of infections, large gatherings may have dropped more than in Japan where the SSEs were
found through contact tracing. Nonetheless, these estimates suggest that various environments
and policies could decrease the risks of the extreme SSEs. This observation motivates our policy
simulations to target SSEs.
Next, we compare the assumption of power law distribution relative to that of a negative
binomial distribution. Figure 3 shows that the negative binomial distributions would predict
that the extreme SSEs will be fewer than the observed distribution: while it predicts the overall

there were only 248 cases of more than one secondary infections reported in the data among
27,890 primary cases in the data from India. That is, only 0.8 percents of primary cases were reported to have
infected more than one persons. In contrast, there were 27 cases with more than one secondary infections among
110 primary cases in Japan. That is, 25 percent of primary cases were infectious. This difference in ration likely
reflects the data collection quality than actual infection dynamics.

Notes: Table 2 shows the size of secondary cases at each quantile, top 1 percentile, 5 percentile, and 10

Singapore, for COVID-19 are from Japan, and for MARS is from around the world.

probability of SSEs accurately, they suggest that, when they occur, they will not be too extreme
in magnitude. Table 1 reports the relative likelihood, in logs, of observing the data given the
estimated parameters. It shows that, under the estimated power law distribution relative to the
estimated negative binomial distribution, it is 108 − 1020 times more likely to observe the SARS
data (1040 times more for MERS, and 1011 times more COVID-19 data in Japan). Such large
differences emerge because the negative binomial distribution, given its implicit assumption
of finite variance, suggests that the extreme SSEs are also extremely rare when estimated with
entire data sets11 . If our objective is to predict the overall incidents of infections parsimoniously,
then negative binomial distribution is well-validated and theoretically founded (Lloyd-Smith
et al., 2005).12 However, if our goal is to estimate the risks of extreme SSEs accurately, then
using only two parameters with finite variance to estimate together with the entire distribution
may be infeasible.
These distributional assumptions have critical implications for the prediction of the extreme
SSEs. Table 2 presents what magnitude top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% among SSEs will be given
each estimates of the distribution. Given the estimates of the negative binomial distribution,
even the top 1% of SSEs above 8 cases will be around the magnitude of 19-53. However, given
a range of estimates from power law distribution, the top 1% could be as large as 569. Thus, it
is no longer surprising that the largest reported case for COVID-19 will be over 1,000 people.
In contrast, such incidents have vanishingly low chance under binomial distributions. Since
the SSEs are rare, researchers will have to make inference about their distribution based some
parametric methods. Scrutinizing such distributional assumptions along with the estimation of
parameters themselves will be crucial in accurate prediction of risks of extreme SSEs.
11 For

example, the binomial distribution estimate suggests an incidence of 185 cases (residential infection in
Hong Kong) only has a chance of 9.5 × 10−10 occurring for any single primary case.
12 Since the power law distribution is fitted only to SSEs, estimated power law distribution may fit the data
better than the estimated negative binomial distribution that was meant to fit the entire data set. Rather than
making such comparison, this estimation is intended to illustrate the magnitude of difference between the two
distributional assumptions. Because of significant missing values for the low number of infections in the COVID19 from across the world and India, we will not use the data sets for estimation of negative binomial distributions.

3 Theory
Motivated by the evidence, we extend an otherwise standard stochastic SIR model with a fattailed SSEs. Unlike with thin-tailed distributions, we show that idiosyncratic risks of SSEs
induce aggregate uncertainties even when the infected population is large. We further show
that the resulting uncertainties in infection rates have important implications for average epidemiological outcomes. Impacts of lockdown policies that target SSEs are discussed.

3.1

Stochastic SIR model with fat-tailed distribution

Suppose there are i = 1, ..., N individuals, living in periods t = 1, 2, .... Infected individuals pass
on and recover from infection in heterogeneous and uncertain ways. Let β it denote the number
of new infection in others an infected individual i makes at time t. Let γit ∈ {0, 1} denote the
recovery/removal, where a person recovers (γit = 1) with probability γ ∈ [0, 1]. Note that,
whereas zit in Section 2 was a stochastic analogue of “effective” reproduction number, β it here
is such analogue of “basic reproduction number.” Assuming enough mixing in the population,
these two models are related by zit = β it SNt , where St is a number of susceptible individuals in
the population.
This model departs from other stochastic SIR models only mildly: we consider a fat-tailed,
instead of thin-tailed, distribution of infection rates. Based onthe evidence, we consider a power
law distribution of β it : its countercumulative distribution is given by
P ( β it ≥ β) = π ( β/β)−α
for the exponent α and a normalizing constant β, and π ∈ [0, 1] is the probability that β ≥ β.
Note that the estimated exponent α can be mapped to this model, as discussed in Appendix A.1.
If we assume β it is distributed according to exponential distribution or negative binomial distribution, we obtain a class of stochastic SIR models commonly studied in the epidemiological
literature (see Britton (2010, 2018) for surveys). We will compare the evolution dynamics under
this power law distribution against those under negative binomial distribution as commonly
assumed, keeping the average basic reproduction number the same. To numerically implement
this, we will introduce normalization to the distributions.
The evolution dynamics is described by the following system of stochastic difference equations. Writing the total number of infected and recovered/removed populations by It and Rt ,

This system is a discrete-time and finite-population analogue of the continuous-time and continuouspopulation differential equation SIR models.
Parametrization: we parametrize the model as follows. The purpose of simulation is a proof
of concept, rather than to provide a realistic numbers. We take the length of time to be one week.
We set the sum of the recovery and the death rate per day is 1/18 following Wang et al. (2020),
so that γ = 7/18. As a benchmark case, we set α = 1.1, which is the average from the our
estimates from SARS and COVID-19 in Japan, but we explore several other parametrization,
α ∈ {1.08, 1.2, 1.5, 2}. As documented in Nishiura et al. (2020), 75% of people did not infect
others. We therefore set π = 0.25. This number is also in line with the evidence from SARS
reported in Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005), in which 73% of cases were barely infectious. We choose β,
which controls the mean of β it , so that the expected R0 ≡ Eβ it /γ per day is 2.5, corresponding
to the middle of the estimates obtained in Remuzzi and Remuzzi (2020). This leads us to choose
β = 0.354 in the case of α = 1.1.
We will contrast the above model to a model in which β it is distributed according to negative
binomial, β it /γ ∼ negative binomial(R0 , k ). The mean of this distribution is Eβ it /γ = R0 ,
ensuring that it has the same mean basic reproduction number as in the power law case, and

variance). We use the estimates of SARS by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2005), k = 0.16. The mean is set
to the same value as power law case, R0 = 2.5,

3.2 Effects of fat-tailed distribution on uncertainty
Figure 4a shows 10 sample paths of infected population generated through the simulation of
the model with α = 1.1. One can immediately see that even though all the simulation start
from the same initial conditions under the same parameters, there is enormous uncertainty in
the timing of the outbreak of the disease spread, the maximum number of infected, and the final
number of susceptible population. The timing of outbreak is mainly determined by when SSEs
occur. To illustrate the importance of a fat-tailed distribution, Figure 4b shows the same sample
path but with a thin-tailed negative binomial distribution. In this case, as already 1,000 people
are infected in the initial period, the CLT implies the aggregate variance is very small and the

Figure 5: Histogram from 1000 simulation
Note: Figure 5 plots the histogram from 1000 simulations, in which we draw { β it , γit } randomly every
period in an i.i.d. manner. The cumulative number of infected is ST , where we take T = 204 weeks.
The herd immunity threshold is given by the cumulative number of infected, at which the infection is
at the peak. Formally, St∗ where t∗ = arg maxt It . The peak number of infected is maxt It .

model is largely deterministic. This is consistent with Britton (2018). Britton (2018) shows that
when the total population is as large as 1,000 or 10,000, the model quickly converges to the
deterministic counterpart.
Figure 5 compares the entire distribution of the number of cumulative infection (top-left),
the herd immunity threshold (top-right), the peak number of infected (bottom-left), and the
days it takes to infect 5% of population (bottom-right). The herd immunity threshold is defined
as the cumulative number of infected at which the number of infected people is at its peak. The
histogram contrast the case with power law distribution with α = 1.1 to the case with negative
binomial distribution. It is again visible that uncertainty remains in all outcomes when the
distribution of infection rate is fat-tailed. For example, the cumulative infection varies from
65% to 100% in the power law case, while the almost all simulation is concentrated around 92%
in the case of negative binomial distribution.

power law tail parameters, α, as well as for negative binomial distribution. With fat-tails, i.e. α
close to one, the range between 90th percentile and 10th percentile for all statistics is wide, but
this range is substantially slower as the tail becomes thinner (α close to 2). For example, when
α = 1.08 the peak infection rate can vary from 6% to 32% as we move from 10the percentile
to 90th percentile. In contrast, when α = 2, the peak infection rate is concentrated at 26–
27%. Moreover, when α = 2, the model behaves similarly to the model with negative binomial
distribution because the CLT applies to both cases.

Effects of fat-tailed distribution on average

While our primary focus was the effect on the uncertainty of epidemiological outcomes, Figure
5 also shows significant effects on the mean. In particular, fat-tailed distribution also lowers

cumulative infection, the herd immunity threshold, the peak infection, and delays the time it
takes to infect 5% of population, on average. Why could such effects emerge?
To understand these effects, we consider a deterministic SIR model with continuous time
and continuum of population. In such a textbook model, we consider the effect of small uncertainties (i.e. mean-preserving spread) in R0 . Such theoretical inquiry can shed light on the
effect because the implication of fat-tailed distribution is essentially to introduce time-varying
fluctuation in aggregate R0 . We can thus examine how the outcome changes by R0 , and invoke
Jensen’s inequality to interpret the results.13
1. Effect on cumulative infection: note that the cumulatively infected population is given
by 1 − S∞ /N, where S∞ is the ultimate susceptible population as t → ∞. Taking the
derivations shown in Harko et al. (2014), Moll (2020) or Toda (2020), S∞ satisfies the following equation:14
log(S∞ /N ) = −R0 (1 − S∞ /N )
(6)
In Appendix B, we prove that S∞ is a convex function of R0 if R0 > 1.125, , which is likely
to be met in SARS or COVID-19.15 Thus, the cumulative infection is concave in R0 , and
the mean-preserving spread in R0 lowers the cumulative infection.
2. Effect on herd immunity threshold: denoting the number of recovered/removed and

where R0 ≡ β/γ. Thus, R∗ is concave in R0 . Thus, the mean-preserving spread in R0
lowers the herd immunity threshold.
3. Effect on timing of outbreak: let us consider the time t∗ when some threshold of outbreak

exactly the same as our original SIR model because there R0 fluctuates over time within a simulation. Thus this is
for providing intuition, rather than a proof.

satisfies
(9)

where S0 is initial susceptible population. We show in the Appendix that (9) implies that
the peak infection, I max /N, is a concave function of R0 if and only if R0 ≥ S10 exp(0.5). If
we let S0 ≈ 1, this implies R0 ≥ exp(0.5) ≈ 1.65. This explains why we found a reduction
in peak infection rate, as we have assumed R0 = 2.5. Loosely speaking, since the peak
infection rate is bounded above by one, it has to be concave for sufficiently high R0 .
Overall, we have found that the increase in the uncertainty over R0 has effects similar to a
decrease in the level of R0 . This is because the aggregate fluctuations in R0 introduce negative
correlation between the future infection and the future susceptible population. High value of
β
today’s R0 ≡ E γit increases tomorrow’s infected population, It+1 , and decreases tomorrow’s
susceptible population, St+1 . That is, Cov(St+1 , It+1 ) < 0. Because the new infection tomorrow
S
is a realization of β t+1 multiplied by the two (that is, β t+1 It+1 tN+1 ) this negative correlation
reduces the spread of the virus in the future on average, endogenously reducing the magnitude
of the outbreak.
This interpretation also highlights the importance of intertemporal correlation of infection
rates, Cov( β t , β t+1 ). When some individuals participate in events at infection-prone environments more frequently than others, the correlation will be positive. Such effects can lead to a
sequence of clusters and an extremely rapid rise in infections (Cooper et al., 2019) that overwhelm the negative correlation between St+1 and It+1 highlighted above. On the other hand,
when infections take place at residential environments (e.g. residential compound in Hong
Kong for SARS, and dormitory in Singapore for COVID-19), then the infected person will be
less likely to live in another residential location to spread the virus. In this case, the correlation
will be negative. In this way, considering the correlation of infection rates across periods will
be crucial.
Note that the mechanism we identified on herd immunity thresholds is distinct from the
ones described in Gomes et al. (2020); Hébert-Dufresne et al. (2020); Britton et al. (2020). They
note that when population has permanently heterogenous activity rate, which captures both
the probability of infecting and being infected, the herd immunity can be achieved with lower
threshold level of susceptible. They explain this because majority of “active” population becomes infected faster than the remaining population. Our mechanism does not hinge on the
permanent heterogeneity in population, which could have been captured by Cov( β it , β it+1 ) =
1. The fat-tailed distribution in infection rate alone creates reduction in the required herd immunity rate in expectation.

3.4

Lockdown policy targeted at SSEs

How could the policymaker design the mitigation policies effectively if the distribution of infection rates is fat-tailed? Here, we concentrate our analysis on lockdown policy. Unlike the
traditionally analyzed lockdown policy, we consider a policy that particularly targets SSEs.
Specifically we assume that the policy can impose an upper bound on β it ≤ β̄ with probability
φ. The probability φ is meant to capture some imperfection in enforcements or impossibility in
closing some essential facilities such as hospitals and daycare. For tractability, we assume that
the government locks down if the fraction of infected exceeds 5% of the population and maintain lockdown for 2 months. Nonetheless, our results are not sensitive to a particular parameter
chosen. We also set β̄ is 5 percentile of the infection rate.
While Table B.3 in Appendix presents results in detail, we briefly summarize the main results here. First, the lockdown policy reduces the mean of the peak infection rate, and the policy
is more effective when the distribution features fatter tails. Second, the targeted lockdown policy is effective in reducing the volatility of the peak infection rate in the case that such risks exist
in the first place. For example, consider the case with α = 1.1. Moving from no policy (φ = 0)
to sufficiently targeted lockdown policy (φ = 0.8) reduces the 90th percentile of peak infection
by 22%. In contrast, when α = 2 or with negative binomial distribution, the policy only reduces by 5% and 10%, respectively. Therefore the policy is particularly effective in mitigating
the upward risk of overwhelming the medical capacity. This highlights that while the fat-tailed
distribution induces the aggregate risk in the epidemiological dynamics, the government can
partly remedy this by appropriately targeting the lockdown policy.
We conclude this section by discussing several modeling assumptions. First, we have assumed that { β it } is independently and identically distributed across individuals and over time.
This may not be empirically true. For example, a person who was infected in a big party is more
likely to go to a party in the next period. This introduces ex ante heterogeneities as discussed
in (Gomes et al., 2020; Hébert-Dufresne et al., 2020; Britton et al., 2020), generating positive correlation in { β it } along the social network. Or, a person who tends to be a superspreader may
be more likely to be a superspreader in the next period. This induces a positive correlation
in { β it } over time. If the resulting cascading effect were large, then the average effects on the
epidemiological outcomes we have found may be overturned. Second, we have exogenously
imposed power law distributions without exploring underlying data generation mechanisms
behind them. The natural next step is to provide a model in which individual infection rate is
endogenously Pareto-distributed. We believe SIR models with social networks along the line
of Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani (2001), Moreno et al. (2002), Castellano and Pastor-Satorras
(2010), May and Lloyd (2001), Zhang et al. (2013), Gutin et al. (2020), and Akbarpour et al. (2020)
are promising avenue to generate endogenous power law in individual infection rates.

4 Estimation methods
We began with the evidence that SSEs follow a power law distribution with fat tails in many
settings, and showed that such distributions substantively change the predictions of SIR models. In this Section, we discuss the implications of power law distributions for estimating the
effective reproduction number.

4.1

Limitations of sample means

Estimation of average reproduction numbers (Rt ) has been the chief focus of empirical epidemiology research (e.g. Becker and Britton, 1999). Our estimates across five different data sets
suggest that the exponent satisfies α ∈ (1, 2) in many occasions: that is, the infection rates have
a finite mean but an infinite variance. Since the mean exists, by the Law of Large Numbers,
the sample mean estimates (see e.g. Nishiura, 2007) that have been used in the epidemiology
research will be consistent (i.e. converge to the true mean asymptotically) and also unbiased
(i.e. its expectation equals the true mean with finite samples.)
Due to the infinite variance property, however, the sample mean will converge very slowly
to the true mean because the classical CLT requires finite variance. Formally, while the conver√
gence occurs at a rate N for distributions with finite variance, or thin tails, it occurs only at
1
a rate N 1− α for the power law distributions with fat tails, α ∈ (1, 2) (Gabaix, 2011).16 Under
distributions with infinite variance, or fat tails, the sample mean estimates could be far from
the true mean with reasonable sample sizes, and their estimated 95 confidence intervals will
be too tight. Figure 6 plots a Monte Carlo simulation of sample mean’s convergence property.
For thin-tailed distributions such as the negative binomial distribution or the power law distribution with α = 2, even though the convergence is slow due to their very large variance, they
still converge to the true mean reasonably under a few 1,000 observations. In contrast, with fattailed distributions such as power law distribution with α = 1.1 or α = 1.2, the sample mean
will remain far from the true mean. Their sample mean estimates behave very differently as the
sample size increases. Every so often, some extraordinarily high values occur that significantly
raises the sample mean and its standard errors. When such extreme values are not occurring,
the sample means gradually decrease. With thin tails, such extreme values are rare enough not
to cause such sudden increase in sample means; however, with fat tails, the extreme values are
not so rare.

16 For

α = 1 exactly, the convergence will occur at rate ln N.

The draws of observations are simulated through the inverse-CDF method, where the identical uniform
random variable is applied so that the sample means are comparable across four different distributions.

the dispersion parameter k = 0.16 taken from (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). The range of power law (PL)
parameters is also taken from the empirical estimates.

4.2 Using power law exponents to improve inference
What methods could address the concerns that the sample mean may be empirically unstable?
One approach may be to exclude some realizations as an outlier, and focus on subsamples without extreme values17 . However, such analysis will neglect major source of risks even though
extreme "outlier" SSEs may fit the power law distributions as shown in Figure 1. While estimating the mean of distributions with rare but extreme values has been notoriously difficult18 ,
17 In

Japan, the case of over 620 infections in the cruise ship Diamond Princess was excluded from all other
analyses.
18 Consider, for example, a binary distribution of infection rates such that one infects N others with 1/N probability, and 0 others with 1 − 1/N probability. In this case, the true mean Rt = 1. Suppose a statistician observes
10 infected cases for each estimation. If N were 1,000, then with 99(≈ 0.99910 ) percent chance, nobody becomes
infected so that R̂t = 0, and the estimates’ confidence interval will be [0, 0]. But with less than 1 percent chance
when any infection occurs, R̂t will be larger than 100. Thus, the 95 percent confidence interval contains the true
mean in less than 1 percent of the time. To the best of our knowledge, there is no techniques that can help us
completely avoid this problem given the fundamental constraint of small sample size.

Notes: Figure 7 plots the estimates of power law exponents and the resulting estimates of sample median, using the same data as in Figure 6. Note that while the number of observations
contains all observations, the data points contributing to the estimates are only above some
thresholds: only less than 25 percents of the data contribute to the estimation of the exponents.

there are some approaches to address this formally.
With power law distributions, the estimates of exponent have information that can improve
the estimation of the mean. Figure 7 shows that the exponents α can be estimated adequately
with reasonable sample sizes.19 If α > 2, as may be the case for the India under strict lockdown,
then one can have more confidence in the reliability of sample mean estimates. However, if
α < 2, the sample mean may substantially differ from the true mean. At the least, one can be
aware of the possibility.
One transparent approach is a “plug-in” method: to estimate the exponent α̂, and plug into
α̂
the formula of the mean α̂−
1 Z. This method yields a valid 95 confidence intervals (C.I.) of the
20
median since the estimated α̂ has valid confidence intervals.21 Figure 7 shows the estima19 The

standard errors are computed by the maximum likelihood approach, as the linear regressions are known
to underestimate the standard errors (see Gabaix and Ibragimov, 2011).
20 Note that the estimate corresponds to the median estimate because α̂ is a non-linear transformation of α̂.
α̂−1
21 To be more formal, the correct C.I. will be to consider the uncertainties with the mean of observations below Z.
To focus on the uncertainty from upper tail, we construct the 95 percent C.I. from that of the estimate of $\alpha$

tion results for the same data with α = 1.1, 1.2 as shown in Figure 6. First, while the sample
mean in Figure 6 had substantially underestimated the mean, this estimated median is close to
the true mean. Second, while the sample mean estimation imposed symmetry between lower
and upper bounds of 95 percent confidence intervals, this estimate reflects the skewness of uncertainties: upward risks are much higher than downward risks because of the possibility of
extreme events. Third, the standard errors are much larger, reflecting the inherent uncertainties
given the limited sample sizes.22 Fourth, the estimates are more stable and robust to the extreme values23 than the sample mean estimates that have sudden jumps in the estimates after
the extreme values.
Table 5 demonstrates the validity of the “plug-in” method through a simulation experiment.
The table shows the comparison of the probability that the constructed 95% C.I. covers the true
mean using the 1,000 Monte-Carlo simulation. When the estimate is unbiased and has correct
standard errors, this coverage probability is 95%. When the power law exponent is close to
one, the traditional “sample means” approach has the C.I. that covers the true mean only with
20-40% for all sample sizes. By contrast the “plug-in” method covers the true estimates close
to 95%. As the tail becomes thinner toward α = 2, the difference between the two tends to
disappear, with “sample mean” approach performing better some times. When the underlying
distribution has fat-tails, however, estimation using the plug-in method is preferred.
While the C.I. in the plug-in method has adequate coverage probabilities, it is often very
large and possibly infinite. Figure 7 visualizes this. This large C.I. occurs especially when
α ' 1 because the mean of a power law distribution is proportional to 1−α α . How could the
policymakers plan their efforts do given such large uncertainty in R0 ? Given the theoretical
results in Section 3 that the epidemiological dynamics will be largely uncertain even when α ' 1
is perfectly known, we argue that applying the estimated R0 into a deterministic SIR model
will not lead to a reliable prediction. Instead of focusing on the mean, it will be more adequate
and feasible to focus on the distribution of near-future infection outcomes. For example, using
the estimated power law distribution, policymakers can compute the distribution of the future
infection rate. The following analogy might be useful: in planning for natural disasters such as
hurricanes and earthquakes, policymakers will not rely on the estimates of average rainfall or
average seismic activity in the future; instead, they consider the probabilities of some extreme
events, and propose plans contingent on realizations. Similar kinds of planning may be also
constructive regarding preparation for future infection outbreaks.
To overcome data limitations, epidemiologists have developed a number of sophisticated
here.
22 When the number of observations is less than 1000, the estimated confidence interval of α contains values
less than 1.0, turning the upper bound of the mean to be ∞. This does not mean that a correct expectation is ∞
infections in the near future, but that there is serious upward risks in infection rates.
23 This is because the estimation through log-likelihood will take the log of the realized value, instead of its
level.

methods such as backcalculation assuming Poisson distribution (Becker et al., 1991), and ways
to account for imported cases. There are also a number of methods developed to account for
fat-tailed distributions (see e.g. Stoyanov et al., 2010, for a survey), such as tail tempering (Kim
et al., 2008) and separating the data into sub-groups (Toda and Walsh, 2015). In the future, it
will be important to examine what power law distributions will imply about existing epidemiological methods, and how statistical techniques such as plug-in methods can be combined with
epidemiological techniques to allow more reliable estimation of risks.

Conclusion: implications for COVID-19 pandemic

Most research on infection dynamics has focused on deterministic SIR models, and have estimated its key statistics, the average reproduction number (R0 ). In contrast, some researchers
have concentrated on SSEs, and estimated the dispersion of infection rates using negative binomial distributions. Nonetheless, stochastic SIR models based on estimated distributions have
predicted that idiosyncratic uncertainties in SSEs would vanish when the infected population
is large, and thus, the epidemiological dynamics will be largely predictable. In this paper,
we have documented evidence from SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 that SSEs actually follow a
power law distribution with the exponent α ∈ (1, 2): that is, their distributions have infinite
variance rather than finite variance as with the negative binomial distributions. Our stochastic SIR model with these fat-tailed distributions have shown that idiosyncratic uncertainties in
SSEs will persist even when the infected population is as large as 1,000, inducing major unpre-

dictability in aggregate infection dynamics.
Since the currently infected population is estimated to be around 3 million in the COVID19 pandemic,24 our analysis has immediate implications for policies of today. For statistical
inference, the aggregate unpredictability suggests caution is warranted on drawing inferences
about underlying epidemiological conditions from observed infection outcomes. First, large
geographic variations in infections may be driven mostly by idiosyncratic factors, and not by
fundamental socioeconomic factors. While many looked for underlying differences in public
health practices to explain the variations, our model shows that these variations may be more
adequately explained by the presence of a few, idiosyncratic SSEs. Second, existing stochastic
models would suggest that, keeping the distribution of infection rates and pathological environments constant, recent infection trends can predict the future well. In contrast, our analysis
shows that even when the average number of new infections may seem to have stabilized at a
low level in recent weeks, subsequent waves can suddenly arrive in the future.
Such uncertainties in outbreak timing and magnitude introduce substantial socioeconomic
difficulties, and measures to assess and mitigate such risks will be invaluable. Because the
death rate is shown to increase when the medical capacity binds, the social cost of infection
is a convex function of infection rates. In this sense, reducing uncertainties has social benefits. Furthermore, uncertainties can severely deter necessary investments and impede planning
for reallocation and recovery from the pandemic shocks. To assess such risks, we can estimate the tail distributions to improve our inference on the average number. To address such
risks, social distancing policies and individual efforts can focus on large physical gatherings
in infection-prone environments. Our estimates suggest, like earthquakes, infection dynamics
will be largely unpredictable. But unlike earthquakes, they are a consequence of social decisions, and efforts to reduce SSEs can significantly mitigate the uncertainty the society faces as a
whole.

24 According

to worldometers.info, the cumulative infection worldwide is 7 million, among which 4 million
have already recovered or died, as of June 9, 2020.

Appendix

A Empirical Appendix
A.1

Relating empirical distribution of Z to theoretical distribution of β it

In this paper, we have used the estimates from the data to simulate the evolution dynamics of
the epidemiological model. The key step in our argument is that the tail distribution of ∑i zit
or ∑t zit , the cumulative “effective” number of infections, is equivalent to the tail distribution of
β it , the individual and per-period “basic” number of infection. However, in general, this needs
not hold: for example, even if β it were normally distributed (i.e. thin tailed), Z may follow a tdistribution (i.e. fat-tailed). Under what conditions is our interpretation about the relationship
between distribution of Z and distribution of β i valid? Are they plausible in the settings of the
coronaviruses?
To clarify this question, let us lay out a model. Formally, Z is a mixture distribution of the
weighted sum of β it . Here, we provide notations for ∑t zit but the identical argument will also
apply to ∑i zit . Specifically, suppose i stays infected for t periods, and let the probability mass


be δ t . In the case of exponential decay as in the SIR model, δ t = γt . Denoting the countercumulative distribution of Zi by Φ, and that of β it by F, we have

A.1.1 Empirical evidence on causes of SSEs
First, we may be concerned that, even if Φ is a power law distribution, F may not be a power law
distribution. A counterexample is that a geometric Brownian motion with stochastic stopping
time that follows exponential distribution can also generate power law distributions of the tail
(Beare and Toda, 2020). That is, the tail property of Φ needs not be due to tails of F: for ∑t zit , it
could also due to some individuals staying infectious for an extremely long periods. For ∑i zit ,
it could also be due to some events having extremely high number of infected primary cases.
While we acknowledge such possibilities, we argue that for superspreaders or SSEs of the
coronaviruses, the main mechanism of extremely high number of cumulative infection is primarily due to some extreme events at particular time t. Let us be concrete. If the counterexample’s reasoning were true for ∑t zit , then a superspreader is someone who goes, for example, to

a restaurant and infect two other people at time t, and then goes to a shopping mall and infects
three other people at time t + 1, and then goes to meet her two friends and infect them, and
so on. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with numerous anecdotes. Instead, a superspreader infects many people because he attends a SSE that has infection-prone environment at
a particular time t. Conferences, parties, religious gatherings, and sports gyms are a particular
place that can infect many at the same time. Moreover, Nishiura et al. (2020) paper whose data
we use has identified particular environment that has caused SSEs. This interpretation is important because, if the extremely high cumulative number of infection were due to some staying
infectious for a long time or some events having extremely high number of primary cases, then
our model’s prediction of sudden outbreak due to SSE is no longer a valid prediction.
A.1.2 Theoretical analysis on interpretation of exponents
Second, we may be concerned that the exponent of Φ ( Zi ) may be different than the exponent
of F ( β iτ ), even if both have tails that follow power laws. We use two steps to show that this is
not a concern:
(i) if a random variable has a power law distribution with exponent α, then its weighted sum
also has a tail distribution that follows a power law with exponent α (see e.g. Jessen and
Mikosch (2006) or Gabaix (2009)). Thus, neither summation over multiple periods nor the
weights of SNτ will change this.
f (Z)

(ii) the tail property of distribution can be examined by considering α F ( Z ) = f (cZ) for some
c 6= 1 and taking its limit. In particular, if F has a power law distribution, then α F ( Z ) =
cα .25 Denoting the probability mass of Gt (·) by gt (·), and the normalizing constant of
each t by At ,

Thus, the exponent of Φ ( Zi ) will be identical to the exponent of F ( β iτ ) asymptotically.
This discussion suggests that whenever possible, it is desirable to take the estimates from the
tail end of the distribution instead of using moderate values of Z. For the COVID-19 from the
world, the distributions are estimated from the very extreme tail. But when the sample size of
SSEs is limited, choice of how many observations to include thus faces a bias-variance trade-off.
Nonetheless, as many statistical theories are based on asymptotic results, these arguments show
that it is theoretically founded to interpret the exponent of Φ ( Zi ) as the exponent of F ( β iτ ), at
least given the data available.
25 This

capture the essence of power laws – that whatever the value of Z, its frequency and frequency of cZ has
the same ratio.

A.2

Robustness

We present several robustness checks on our empirical results.
A.2.1 Figure 1 with a different cut-off
In Figure 1, we truncated the size of cluster from below at 40. Figure A.1 instead show results
with a cut-off of 20. The fit is worse at the lower tail of the distribution, which suggests that
the lower tail may not be approximated by power law distribution. This is a common feature
among many examples. However, what matters for the existence of variance is the upper tail
distribution, we do not think this is a concern. Moreover, given that the data partly come
from media reports, the clusters of small sizes likely suffer from omission due to lack of media
coverage.
A.2.2 Robustness of power law exponents estimates
Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) show that an estimate of 2 is biased in a small sample and propose
a simple bias correction method that replace the dependent variable with ln(rank − 1/2). Panel
A of Table A.1 show the results with this bias correction method. The results are broadly very
similar to our baseline results in Table 1.
Panel B of Table A.1 conduct another robustness check, where we estimate using the maximum likelihood. Again, the point estimates are overall similar to the baseline results, although
standard errors are larger.

A.3 Additional Tables and Figures
Table A.2 shows several examples of superspreading events during COVID-19 pandemic.

Results for targeted lockdown policy experiment

Table B.3 shows the simulation results with lockdown policies targeted at SSEs. φ = 0 corresponds to no policy, φ = 0.4 (φ = 0.8) means that the government can prevent SSEs with 40%
(80%) probability. As already discussed in the main text, when the distribution is fat-tailed, the
targeted policy is not only effective in reducing the mean of the peak infection rate, but also its
volatility (the interval between 90 percentile and 10 percentile).
