ABSTRACT

Background: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
is possible among symptom-free individuals and some patients are avoiding medically necessary
healthcare visits for fear of becoming infected in the healthcare setting. Limited data are
available on the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptom-free U.S. healthcare
workers (HCW).
Methods: A cross-sectional convenience sample of symptom-free HCWs from the metropolitan
area surrounding Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota was enrolled between April 20th and June
24th, 2020. A participant self-collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was obtained. SARS-CoV-2
infection was assessed via polymerase chain reaction. Participants were queried about their
willingness to repeat a self-collection NPS for diagnostic purposes. We had >95% power to
detect at least one positive test if the true underlying prevalence of SARS-CoV2 was ≥1%.
Results: Among n=489 participants 80% were female and mean age±SD was 41±11.
Participants reported being physicians (14%), nurse practitioners (8%), physician’s assistants
(4%), nurses (51%), medics (3%), or other which predominantly included laboratory technicians
and administrative roles (22%). Exposure to a known/suspected COVID-19 case in the 14 days
prior to enrollment was reported in 40% of participants. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any
participant. Over 95% of participants reported a willingness to repeat a self-collected NP swab in
the future.
Conclusions: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely <1% in a convenience
sample of symptom-free Minnesota healthcare workers from April 20th and June 24th, 2020. Self-

INTRODUCTION

Current evidence suggests that nearly half of new severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are due to transmission from asymptomatic or
presymptomatic (i.e. symptom-free) individuals.1-4
Healthcare workers (HCW) have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection given their
exposure to the virus while serving on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. HCW can
inadvertently be a source of transmission since close contact with patients is often required for
effective health care. However, it is also possible that the risk of infection among HCW might be
similar to community risk as was recently seen in New York.5
To date there are limited data on the point prevalence – an absolute measure of infection
– of infection among symptom-free HCW. These data can inform the potential role HCW play in
transmission, guide testing recommendations and inform infection modeling studies. In addition,
given the evidence that patients are avoiding medically necessary healthcare visits for fear of
becoming infected, absolute measures of infection can inform the potential risk that a patient
might encounter a symptom-free healthcare professional.6
To address this question, we screened symptom-free HCW for SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, to preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), we implemented a protocol for
self-collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and surveyed participants about their perceived
quality of a self-collected vs. provider collected NPS.

METHODS

Participants. A convenience sample of individuals working in Minnesota healthcare facilities
located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area was enrolled. Participants were identified
via social media advertisements and enrolled from April 20th–June, 24th, 2020. Eligibility criteria
were: i) employed or volunteering in a healthcare facility; ii) free of fever, chills, anosmia,
pharyngitis, recently developed persistent cough, nasal congestion suspected to be unrelated to
season allergies; iii) age 18-80 years; iv) not pregnant. A total of 489 participants provided selfcollected NPS (Figure 1). The study was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional
Review Board. All participants provided informed consent.
Self-Collected Nasopharyngeal Swab (NPS). Participants advanced a nylon flocked-tip NPS
through the nasal passage (bilaterally) 3-4 inches into the nasopharynx and swirled the swab 360
degrees for 5 seconds. The swab tip was preserved in 3 mL of 95% ethanol, immediately placed
on an ice bath, and transferred to a -80oC freezer. Samples were shipped overnight on dry ice to
UC San Diego.
Laboratory Assessment of SARS-CoV-2. Samples were processed within 48 hours of receipt at
UC San Diego. Total nucleic acid was extracted from the swab heads using the
MagMAXTM Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (A42357) and eluted in 100 µl
nuclease-free H2O. SARS-CoV-2 Screening was performed using the one-step Applied
Biosystems TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (A47814) (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFSAssets/LSG/manuals/MAN0019181_TaqPath_COVID-19_IFU_EUA.pdf) following the
manufacture’s protocol with the following exceptions: The reaction volume was scaled down to
3 µL with proportional reagent scaling and a replacement of ~94% of the water with participant

RNA. Additionally, the MS2 phage spike-in control was diluted 160-fold to improve sensitivity
through reducing competition for reagent material within the multiplex RT-qPCR
reaction. Samples were prepared in 384 well reaction plates using a mosquito® HV Robotic
Liquid Handler (SPT Labtech) and a mosquito® X1 (HV) Robotic Liquid Handler (SPT
Labtech). The RT-qPCR was analyzed in a QuantStudio5 qPCR instrument (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Positive controls for each SARS-CoV-2 target amplified as expected, as well as all
MS2 sample controls. None of the negative controls amplified.
Questionnaires. Prior to the NPS, participants completed online surveys. After the NPS,
participants were queried about their perception of the procedure relative to NPS they have
performed on patients. They reported their level of discomfort with the self-swab on a scale of 1
(no discomfort) to 10 (the most discomfort they have ever experienced), their likelihood of
repeating a self-collected NPS for clinical or research purposes.
Statistical analysis. Analyses were preformed using SAS version 9.4. Descriptive characteristics
are reported as mean±SD for continuous variables and %(n) for categorical variables. Bivariate
analyses, t-tests and Chi-Square tests assessed statistical significance.
We had >95% power to detect at least one positive test if the true underlying prevalence
of SARS-CoV2 was ≥1%.

RESULTS

Among 489 participants enrolled, the mean age was 41±11 and 80% were female. All
participants worked in facilities located in the seven-county Minneapolis and St. Paul
metropolitan area. The average number of people living with participants was 2±1.4 and 12%

reported living alone. The average number of children living with participants was 0.9±1.1 and
50% reported having at least one child at home.
The average time between NPS collection and laboratory testing was 36±18 (range=2-68)
days. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any sample.
In the 14 days prior to enrollment, 40% of participants reported a known COVID-19
exposure. This proportion varied by venue (p<0.0001, Table 1) and role (p<0.01, Table 1). PPE
use was high with only 1.4% of participants reporting no PPE use and this occurred among
individuals without patient contact.
The mean score for discomfort related to the self-collected NPS was 4.5±2.0 (range=110, Figure 2). Among the 62% (n=287) of participants who reported performing an NPS on a
patient, 89% indicated that their self-swabbing depth was ≥ the depth of prior patient swabs, and
95% reported that their self-swab was ≥ the duration of previous patient swabs. Over 95% of
participants reported a willingness to repeat a self-collected NPS in the future for either clinical
or research purposes (Figure 2); 24% preferred a provider collected-swab, 57% preferred selfcollection and 19% reported no preference.

DISCUSSION

We did not detect any SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals among a convenience sample of
symptom-free HCW. Based on our power calculations, this strongly suggests that the point
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in our study sample of symptom-free HCW was <1%. This is
consistent with results in the U.S. population and in MN specifically during the period these
samples were collected. National seroprevalence estimates reported by the Centers for Disease

Control, including Minnesota, ranged from 1%-7%, and the estimate from Minnesota during the
period from April 20th – May 12th, 2020, was 2.2%7. Seroprevalence estimates reflect an
approximation of SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence since the beginning of the pandemic and
are expected to be higher than the point prevalence estimates as the pandemic progresses. Low
SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence in HCWs, despite increased relative risk for infection compared
to the general population8, is plausible since HCW are prioritized to receive PPE and are trained
in infection control which likely translates into reduced infection risk.
Our findings from the self-collected NPS survey suggest that the self-collection of NPS
was acceptable to HCW, and that the depth and duration of swabbing in the nasopharynx is
consistent with provider performed swabbing. Broader implementation of self-collection
protocols could preserve PPE and enhance testing capacity as the pandemic progresses.
The sensitivity of our screening tests might have been low due to the use self-collected
NPS, although recent studies report self-collection protocols to have acceptable sensitivity9,10.
Tests among symptom-free individuals could also have reduced sensitivity, however, prior
studies in asymptomatic pregnant women11,12 and residents of long-term care facilities13 have
detected high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. As this was a convenience sample, it is not
representative of all HCWs in Minnesota, nor is it representative of what future SARS-CoV-2
prevalence estimates might be among symptom-free HCW in settings with high community
prevalence. Importantly, there was no systematic inclusion of participants from long-term care
facilities where infection risk has been notably higher in Minnesota.
Our results suggest that while the healthcare worker force is very likely to be at increased
relative risk for infection compared to the general population8, the point prevalence of SARSCoV-2 infection was low in symptom-free Minnesota healthcare workers. If true, the probability

of encountering an infected symptom-free healthcare professional during a medically necessary
healthcare visit is likely low when community point prevalence is low. Self-collected NP swabs
are acceptable to participants and might be a future alternative to provider-collected swabs to
preserve PPE. Ongoing monitoring of infection in healthcare workers will be important as the
pandemic progresses and community transmission rises across the country.
