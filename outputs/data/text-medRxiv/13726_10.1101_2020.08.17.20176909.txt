Abstract: The evolution of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) into a pandemic has severely hampered the usage
of public transit systems. In a post-COVID-19 world, we may see an increased reliance on autonomous cars and
personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, with inherent physical distancing, over buses, trains and aircraft for intracity,
intercity, and interstate travel. However, air travel would continue to be the dominant mode of intercontinental
transportation for humans. In this study, we perform a comprehensive computational analysis of typical
intercontinental aircraft ventilation systems to determine the seat where environmental factors are most conducive
to human comfort with regards to air quality, protection from orally or nasally released pollutants such as CO2
and coronavirus, and thermal comfort levels. Air velocity, temperature, and air pollutant concentration emitted
from the nose/mouth of fellow travelers are considered for both Boeing and Airbus planes. In each plane, first
class, business class, and economy class sections were analyzed. We present conclusions as to which is the
optimum seat in each section of each plane and provide the data of the environmental conditions to support our
inferences. The findings may be used by the general public to decide which seat to occupy for their next
intercontinental flight. Alternatively, the commercial airliners can use such a model to plan the occupancy of the
aircraft on long-duration intercontinental flights (viz., Airbus A380 and Boeing B747).

INTRODUCTION
In the present-day world, where on one hand public policy
makers are grappling to contain the spread of COVID-19 [1], on
the other hand certain transit systems are facing existential
threats [2]. COVID-19 has crippled public transit systems such
as rails, buses, ride-shares, car rentals, and domestic flights.
Lowered ridership, increased sanitation requirements in between
rides, and the associated expenses can force these systems into
liquidation (see this report on Hertz [3]). There is a high
possibility of a leapfrog towards autonomous cars and personal
rapid transit (PRT) systems for intercity, intrastate, and interstate
travel. However, air travel would continue to be the dominant
mode of intercontinental transportation of humans. The airliners
would have to pay special attention towards indoor air quality
and thermal comfort.
Numerous requirements and standards exist that dictate
acceptable indoor air quality. When designing a ventilation
system for an airplane fuselage (or cabin) the challenge is to
balance these considerations with fuel efficiency since all air
entering the cabin is being taken from the compression stage of
the engine, reducing thrust [4]. The air is first conditioned to the
desired temperature and humidity then injected into the cabin
through vents on the ceiling at a rate which maximizes efficiency.
The air circulates and then exits through an exhaust along the
outside of the floor. The air is recirculated and mixed with fresh
air before being injected again. Common problems with this
system occur when too much recirculated air is introduced back
into the cabin with too little fresh air, resulting in headaches and
tiredness for passengers [5]. Another concern is the dispersion of
contaminants introduced into the cabin through a couch or
sneeze. Although a multitude of research has been performed to
optimize the ventilation system to most effectively control these
factors, implementation of new technology or equipment in the
aircraft industry is notoriously slow due to stringent safety
guidelines. For this reason, the authors have chosen to examine
the existing system used in commercial aircrafts and perform an
analysis that will allow a passenger to make an educated decision
about which seat will provide the most preferable conditions.
As previously mentioned, extensive research has been performed
in this area simulating the airflow through an aircraft cabin often
with a focus on optimizing the system, or tracking contaminant
dispersion. Additionally, large scale experiments have been
performed to validate the results obtained through computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Although these works are not
directly pertinent, especially when considering different
ventilation simulations, a selection will be briefly discussed
because many parameters of the flow and cabin and techniques
for numerical modeling guided the work done in this paper. One
example, work done by Zhang et al. criticizes current systems
for producing a dry environment with excessive air mixing [5].
As a solution they developed an under-aisle distribution system

which supplies dry air and humidified air through perforated
aisles and increases humidity levels and lowers CO2
concentrations throughout the cabin. Subsequent work, also by
Zhang et al. [6], investigates the viability of a personal chair
armrest air delivery system that delivers fresh outside air directly
to each passenger’s breathe zone. The exhausts are moved to be
overhead instead of on the floor as is typical. They find that this
system results in undesirable vertical temperature gradients, but
is able to prevent contaminant release at any level [6].
Numerous studies have also been performed using an unsteady
inlet condition. Although we chose a steady inlet condition,
which is consistent with most simulations, the results from
unsteady flow provide an interesting comparison. Yan et al.
focused on the spreading of disease from a cough or sneeze in an
aircraft cabin. Experiments were performed in full scale cabin
mockup with an unsteady inlet velocity and tracer gas used to
visualize the flow field. Results showed a more complex, but
narrower spread than with unsteady flow. Results were compared
to CFD results which showed good correlation [7]. Similarly, Wu
et al. performed CFD analysis on a B767 cabin section and
showed that an unsteady air supply had more desirable
temperature and CO2 distribution than the equivalent steady flow
situation [8].
Experiments performed using full scale models of airplane
cabins are especially useful because they provide validation for
our results. Liu et al. [9] provides a review of many experimental
measurements and numerical simulations done to predict flow in
aircraft cabin. Full scale experiments are shown to be the most
reliable and accurate, however they are the most expensive and
time consuming. He concludes simulations are promising as an
alternative [9]. A subsequent study [10] by the same group used
laser tracking and reverse engineering to generate an accurate
model of cabin geometry and measurements of boundary
conditions (at diffusers) and flow fields. They concluded that
flow and boundary conditions in real cabins were complex and
velocity and turbulence of inlet flow varied significantly from
one opening to the next. Hence, an averaged value of this data
serves as a valid approximation for simulations [10].
Wang et al. [11] acquired experimental data from a full scale
mock-up of a Boeing cabin with 35 mannequins including
heaters in their body sections. The goal was to evaluate
ventilation effectiveness and characterizing air distribution. This
study produced results similar to previously published accepted
data and proved that modeling passenger heat emittance from
just the torso section is a reasonable simplification [11]. A
research group lead by Garner [12] performed a study concerned
with an injection of particles to the ventilation system mid-flight
in relation to a terrorist threat. They measured the velocity field
at various points in the actual plane at operating conditions and
perform 2D CFD analysis to compare. CFD results match nicely
with experimental data suggesting that a 2D computational
model is a simplification that does not jeopardize the accuracy
of the solution [12].

Bosbach et al. [13] used particle image velocimetry in a full scale
mock-up of an aircraft cabin to get velocity field data throughout
the domain in order to examine relative effects of forced and
natural convection in the temperature distribution in the cabin.
This was done in order to validate a CFD analysis showing these
effects that was created to minimize computational time. These
results gave us confidence that the accuracy of our results would
be maintained if natural convection was ignored [13].
Airliners offering intercontinental flights will have to rethink
seat placements to ensure safe and uniform environment for each
traveler. One option is to permanently remove less suited seats,
while the other is to seat passengers only on the better positioned
seats. A few recent studies [14-18] have tried to numerically
model the indoor spread of COVID-19 viral particles using CFD.
A couple of studies [19,20] have explicitly studied the transport
of pollutants inside aircraft cabins. However, the flow physics of
virus laded fluid is not trivial [21]. Additionally, no study has yet
modeled the airflow, transport of nasally and orally released
pollutants like CO2 and coronavirus, and thermal efficiency
inside two of the most common long-duration intercontinental
aircrafts (viz., Airbus A380 and Boeing B747). The authors of
the current study present a preliminary computational model to
do the aforementioned and rank the seats of the first class,
business class, and economy class cabins inside A380 and B747.

This paper modeled 2D sections for the airplane cabins, so it was
important to select the right section to correctly represent the 3D
problem. The initial section was across the head and torso of a
human, as shown in Fig. 1. But human bodies occupied
minimum space of the cabin volume hence it was not the correct
representation the 3D space. Additionally, the human body
model interfered with important flow regions, thus stopping the
crucial flow patterns from developing. As a result of this, a new
section, passing through the laps of human and airplane seat was
selected as seen in Fig. 2.
Wang et al [11] mentioned that most of the air supplied from one
passenger row is circulated and finally exhausted in the same row.
Also, Yan et al [7] mentioned in their paper, that most pollutants
are transported only within the releasing half and seldom cross
the middle line. Therefore, the authors have assumed symmetry
in computational domain and hence have considered only half
section of the plane.

PROBLEM SETUP

Boundary conditions for the problem are represented in Fig. 3
and Table 1 as shown below.

Problem physics included solving for the air flow, temperature
distribution, and CO2 transport inside the airplane cabin. CO2
was chosen as a representative pollutant that is released orally or
nasally.

Human body can be modeled either as a constant temperature
boundary or a constant heat source. It was earlier modeled as a
constant temperature boundary when the section across human
head and torso was considered. But as a result of the absence of
human torso from the new section, it was changed to a constant
hear source, in the area corresponding to the human torso. Heat
source was provided only for the torso region and not for the legs,
which was supported by the literature. Human noses were
modeled as CO2 sources in the problem. Circles of radius 2 cm
were created in the cell zone, with their centers lying at the nose
locations, and these were treated as noses.

As the geometry dimensions were very large and the inlet
velocity of air was very low, the flow was expected to be nearly
incompressible. Therefore, it was modeled using incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations.

Four different meshes were created, as shown in figure 4. After
the grid convergence study, the finest mesh of size 0.005 m was
selected. All subsequent simulations were carried out using this
mesh size.
NUMERICAL FORMULATION
As a result of the absence of any transient elements from the
problem, a 2D steady state simulation was performed using
ANSYS Fluent. SIMPLE scheme was used for pressure-velocity
coupling. SIMPLE is useful for the problem at hand, as when a
steady-state problem is solved iteratively, it is not necessary to

Here 𝛼% is the underrelaxation factor for pressure. The

RANS standard k-𝜖 model was used for air flow modeling. The
standard k-𝜖 model is the most widely used RANS model and
was the most preferred model in literature in airplane cabin flow
modeling. Hence, we decided to use this model.
Transport equations for the model are as follows:

where 𝐶9 is a constant.
The model constants 𝐶/7 , 𝐶'7 , 𝐶87 , 𝜎* and 𝜎7 , have the
following default values:
𝐶/7 = 1.44, 𝐶'7 = 1.92, 𝐶87 = 0.09, 𝜎* = 1.0, 𝜎7 = 1.3
Temperature distribution in the cabin was modeled by the default
energy equation in ANSYS Fluent. The species transport module
was used to model CO2 transport with CO2 and air being treated
as two different species.
Final aim was to rank the seats in Airbus and Boeing sections
using the simulation results for velocity, temperature, and CO2
mass concentration. Following ranking scheme was developed:
Seat ranking =

|𝑇 − 𝑇4:;<= | |𝑉 − 𝑉4:;<= | 𝑋 − 𝑋4:;<=
+
+
𝑇4:;<=
𝑉4:;<=
𝑋4:;<=

where,
𝑇4:;<= – Ideal temperature = 294 K
𝑉4:;<= – Ideal velocity = 0.2 m/s
𝑋4:;<= – Ideal mass concentration of CO2 = 1.2 x 10-3
An absolute value was not used for CO2 concentration, because
lower the value of CO2, the better. The ideal temperature and
velocity values were obtained from the ASHRAE handbook
detailing standards for ambient environmental conditions for the
human comfort [22].

As seen from the ranking scheme, closer the values are to the
ideal the value, better the seat, and better the rank. Hence, seat
with the lowest rank is the best seat.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A grid-converge study was carried out with mesh details as
shown in Table 2. Meshes 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Fig. 4-a to 4c. Airbus A380 Business Class section was used for this study.
This section has two seats and is located on the upper deck of
A380 (refer Fig. 14-c). 2-D line plots at the nose-level of
passengers for x-Velocity, mass fraction of CO2, and total
temperature are shown in Figs. 5 through 7 respectively. The
results become invariant as for Mesh 3 and beyond. Mesh 4 is
also able to capture the thermal boundary-layer developed at the
cold window on the left side of the aforementioned section.
Authors of this paper felt the need to refine the mesh further to a
global size of 0.005 m to account for any changes which the other
sections, first and economy, might bring in due to a larger size
and/or more passengers. All the remaining results have been
obtained using a global element size of 0.005 m. Simulations
were carried out for the following six sections:
1. Airbus A380 First, Business and Economy class (3 sections)
2. Boeing B747 First, Business and Economy class (3 sections)
Contour and line plots shown in Figs. 8 through 13 are for the
first class section of A380 and B747. The Airbus section has two
seats and the Boeing one has three seats. Figure 8 shows the
steady state contours for the velocity magnitude for the first class
section of A380 (Fig. 8-a) and B747 (Fig. 8-b). The
corresponding line plots for the velocity magnitude at the noselevel are shown in Fig. 9. Two big eddies are seen in A380 while
a single large eddy is seen in B747. Velocity magnitude plots at
the nose-level for first class sections of A380 and B747 reveal
that the velocity magnitude in B747 follows a monotonic trend
while moving from the center of the cabin (aisle) to the window.
This is due to the presence of a single large eddy seen in B747
as opposed to A380, that has an unpredictable trend in velocity
magnitude at the nose-level.
Figure 10 shows the steady state contours for the mass
concentration of CO2 for the first class section of A380 (Fig. 10a) and B747 (Fig. 10-b). The corresponding line plots for the
mass concentration of CO2 at the nose-level are shown in Fig. 11.
Two big eddies are seen in A380 while a single large eddy is seen
in B747. The CO2 released by the two passengers in A380 seems
to circulate around them as opposed to that in B747 where the
CO2 released by three passengers seems to be swept away more
efficiently towards the outlet. The resulting higher concentration
of CO2 at the nose-level of passengers in A380 can be seen in
Fig. 11-a while that in B747 is shown in Fig. 11-b.
Figure 12 shows the steady state contours for the total
temperature for the first class section of A380 (Fig. 12-a) and

B747 (Fig. 12-b). The corresponding line plots for the total
temperature at the nose-level are shown in Fig. 13. A large
warmer zone can be seen near the window of A380 while the
temperature in A747 seems to be pretty uniform for the major
part of the cabin. This can be further illustrated by observing the
line plots of Fig. 13.
Ranking scheme described in the previous section helps to better
combine this data from Figs. 8 through 13 for the first class
sections of A380 and B747 in the form of a figure of merit like
quantity based on the equation describing the seat ranking.
Lower the value of the ranking quantity, better the seat, and in
turn higher the rank. The ranking obtained using this approach is
schematically shown in Fig. 14-a and Fig. 14-b. As can be seen
in these two figures, A380’s first class seats tie as per the ranking
scheme while B747’s center seat is the most superior when
compared to the window and second to window seats. It should
be noted that mirror image of the shown ranking exists on the
right half of the cabin sections.
Rankings obtained using a similar procedure for the remaining
four sections of interest are shown in Figures 14-c through 14-f.
As with the first class sections, even the business and economy
sections of A380 and B747 have dis-similar rankings for seats
occupying same relative positions. In other words, a window seat
in the economy class of A380 would be most preferred but its
counterpart, an economy window for B747, would be least
preferred. Other results have been presented in the Appendix.
Limitations
The study assumes 2D flow pattern for the ease of caluculations.
This is backed by previous studies and is quite correct for the
central portion of the aircraft. However, authors do recognize
that there can 3D motion of air and thereby the pollutants
released orally or nasally into the air (viz., CO2 and viruses such
as coronavirus) can travel in the longitudinal directions (i.e.,
along the length of the aircraft). This is partiularly important to
consider at the ends of the aircraft as the fluid flow at the ends
will certainly not be 2D. The BCs were based on the data
available in the public doamin or by making conservative
assumptions. These may not accuratley describe the air duct
positions in the studied aircrafts. As a simplifying assumption
that also adds to the factor of safety of the model predictions,
coronavirus was assumed to be present at places where released
CO2 can be found. The released CO2 and the associated
coronavirus concentration has been modeled as a continnum
where as the actual coronavirus particles would be in a discrete
phase. Modeling coronavirus as a discrete phase suspended in air
will be prohibitively expensive with regards to the computational
resources.
These rankings are based on the scheme presented by the authors
and the section views and BCs as available in the public domain.
Many simplifying assumptions are associated with this study and
the actual ranking of the seats can be different based on how

many of these assumptions fail in real life and personal
preference of the traveler.
CONCLUSIONS
Many factors are considered during the decision making process
of purchasing a seat on a plane. Features such as costumer
service, financial means, and inherent bias often drive the
decision making process. However, these factors are not
considered in our conclusions about the ideal airplane seat.
Furthermore, personal preference plays a significant role when
choosing a seat. For example, a particular individual may prefer
to sit by the window so he/she can see the view, or sit by the aisle
so he/she can stretch his/her legs. Also the ideal enviornmental
conditions used in the ranking scheme described previously are
an average and not the same for each individual. Some
passengers may prefer a hotter ambient temperature and other
slightly cooler. For all these reasons we will present our findings
in a way that will no make any assumptions about the passenger,
but instead provide the reader with all the information necessary
to make a more educated purchase with regard to their own
personal prefernces. This information is as shown in Tables 3
through 5.
Each of the abovementioed tables contains data for the three
sections of the airplane: first class, business class, and economy
class. The section is generally chosen based on the financial
means of the traveller so it is unnessasary to compare data
between classes. Each row of the table contains data for each of
the enviornemntal conditions studied in this report. The mass
fraction of CO2 that can be qualitatively thought of as the mass
fraction of orally or nasally released pollutants, is reported as
well as the temperature and air velocity at the seat. The data is
reported for the best seat in every section for the Boeing cabin
and the Airbus cabin. This enables a comparison across classes
between the two planes.
In Table 3 the data for the first class cabins for Airbus and Boeing
are shown. We see that the Airbus seat is warmer than the Boeing
seat, but has worse circulation. This decreased circulation is
confirmed by the lower air velocity and increased mass fraction
of CO2. The Airbus seat will be warm, but with the potential to
be “stuffy”. Conversley the Boeing seat, located in the middle on
the aisle side, will be cooler and breezy.
Table 4 shows the data for the business class sections of both the
planes. Here the effects are reversed with respect to the first class
cabin. We see that the Airbus seat is colder, but offers better
circulation than the Boeing seat. The Airbus seat is located in the
side bank of the seats on the aisle side and the Boeing seat, that
is warmer compared to the Airbus seat and with worse
circulation, is located next to the window.

next to the window while the best seat for the Boeing cabin is the
middle seat in the side bank of the seats. The Airbus seat has a
higher temperature, lower CO2 concentration, and lower air
velocity. Unlike the other sections were the tradeof for a warmer
seat was worse circulation, we conclude that the Airbus economy
best seat is both warm and with good circulation. The Boeing
seat performs less well in all these areas.
The findings from this preliminary multiphysics computational
model may be used by the general public to decide which seat to
occupy for their next intercontinental flight. Alternatively, the
commercial airliners can use such a model to plan the occupancy
of the aircraft on long-duration intercontinental flights (viz.,
Airbus A380 and Boeing B747).
