Abstract:
Background:
There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of COVID-19. At the onset of the
pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to
characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period.

Methods:
We conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with
suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were
evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe
COVID-19 targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

Results:
A total of 352 patients from 15 US hospitals were included. Most patients were treated at academic
medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug
therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir
(10%), and interleukin-6 inhibitors (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy.
Patients with a history of asthma (14.9% vs. 7%, p=0.037) and those enrolled in clinical trials (26.9% vs.
3.2%, p<0.001) were more likely to receive therapy. Among those receiving COVID-19 therapy, eight
patients (12%) experienced an ADR, and ADRs were more commonly recognized in patients enrolled in
clinical trials (62.5% vs 22%, OR=5.9, p=0.028).

Conclusions:
While we observed high rates of supportive care for patients with COVID-19, we also found that ADRs
were common among patients receiving drug therapy including in clinical trials. Comprehensive systems
are needed to identify and mitigate ADRs associated with experimental COVID-19 therapies.

Introduction:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible for
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has caused a global pandemic.1 There are a few potential
therapies with activity against SARS-CoV-2;2 yet, no agent has received Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval to treat COVID-19 to date. Investigational agents proposed at the onset of the pandemic
included antimicrobials, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, and azithromycin. Host
cell modulators including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and agents targeting the host immune
system have also been proposed.2 Use of any of these agents is expected to vary across care settings
and over time as new clinical evidence and safety information becomes available.
Many of the investigational agents lack robust evidence to support their safety in COVID-19,
which may increase the potential risk of undue harm. Each of these agents are associated with adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) based upon prior research, yet little is known about the safety of these agents for
use in patients with COVID-19.3 The safety and efficacy of investigational agents being used currently for
patients with COVID-19 are only beginning to emerge.4 Safety concerns range from arrhythmias and QTc
prolongation with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin5 to intestinal perforation with tocilizumab.6 The
lack of robust evidence on the safety of COVID-19 therapies has prompted the FDA to require clinicians
to report serious adverse events associated with Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) remdesivir.7 A
clear need exists for comprehensive data on ADRs with drug therapies targeting COVID-19.
ADRs associated with investigational and unproven therapies targeting COVID-19 may be
difficult to detect and may vary with the usage rates of supportive care. Routine monitoring for potential
ADRs is encouraged by consensus guidelines, particularly as use of investigational and EUA agents
continues outside of rigorously monitored clinical trials.4 The multicenter point-prevalence methodology
may allow detection of ADR signals on a large scale and is relatively easy to implement rapidly. Although
this methodology does not allow investigators to infer causation, it does supply valuable information
about the landscape of current practice and may discern effects that otherwise could be missed within a
single center.8, 9 We conducted a multicenter point-prevalence study to evaluate the drug therapies used
to treat COVID-19. The objective of this point-prevalence study was to characterize the drug therapies
used in the management of COVID-19, including supportive care and combination therapies, in an
attempt to identify safety signals among acutely ill hospitalized patients.

Patients and methods:
Study design
We conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point-prevalence study of the medical records
for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients were identified at each site according to institutional
guidelines for identification and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The study was reviewed by each
participating organization’s individual Institutional Review Board and found to be exempt. A waiver of
informed consent and HIPAA authorization was completed at each site.
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were hospitalized as inpatients and 1) had a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test completed or 2) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 based on a physician’s diagnosis.
No limitations were placed on time from diagnosis to inclusion. We did not extract information on
protected status with the exception of pediatric status; protected elements not evaluated in this study
included dates of symptom onset or duration of hospitalization prior to evaluation. Patients were
excluded if they were initially treated for COVID-19, but an alternative diagnosis was made prior to
being evaluated for the survey (i.e., COVID-19 was ruled-out).

Data elements
The point-prevalence survey was circulated on April 18, 2020 to 15 hospitals across the United
States (US). Each site was asked to select a random sample of up to 30 patients and to complete data
collection within 1 month. Any hospitalized patient meeting inclusion criteria was eligible. Data were
manually extracted from the electronic health records and was entered into a standardized electronic
survey form. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted
at Northwestern University. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software
platform designed to support data capture for research studies.10, 11 Data validation was coordinated by
the Principal Investigator and each respective site coordinator. Data elements collected included facility
demographics, total number of hospital and ICU beds prior to the pandemic, U.S. Census region location,
patient populations served, facility type (e.g., academic, community, inpatient rehabilitation), and active
clinical trial site status. Given the non-interventional nature of this study, all patients were managed at
each site according to each center’s standard of care and guidelines for the management of COVID-19.
In addition to whether patients were receiving supportive care or drug therapies targeted at
SARS-CoV-2, we collected basic patient demographic information and vital status (e.g., age, sex,
comorbidities, oxygen requirement, and ICU status). Data were abstracted from the electronic medical
record – EMR (e.g., EPIC or Cerner depending on the EMR in use at the site) by infectious diseases and

antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists at each site. For each patient included no follow-up or
longitudinal outcomes were ascertained. Data extraction from the electronic health records were
limited to the prior 24 hours, and no identifiers were collected. Pediatric patients were eligible for
inclusion.

Study definitions
For patients aged > 90 years, age was classified as > 90 years. We evaluated the use of the
following specific medications: azithromycin (AZM), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), tocilizumab or sarilumab
(IL-6 inhibitors), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/R), remdesivir (clinical trial or compassionate use), or other
investigational agents. Clinical trial enrollment status was evaluated based upon notes within the
medical record. Combination therapy was considered as concurrent receipt of more than one agent
targeting SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., HCQ+AZM or HCQ+remdesivir). Requirement and degree of oxygen support
within the last 24 hours was collected (i.e., no oxygen needed, supplemental oxygen required,
mechanical ventilation; low flow, high flow, or invasive ventilation). ICU admission status was also
recorded.
Adverse drug reactions were defined based upon existing knowledge of the side effect profiles
of the agents evaluated as well as the existing literature on adverse events observed in COVID-19
patients at the time of the study. Attribution of ADRs were based upon the electronic health records and
upon the clinical discretion of the data extractors. We evaluated the presence of new or worsening ADRs
occurring concurrent to COVID-19 drug therapies and observed the following reactions within the prior
24 hours: transaminitis (i.e., both 3x and 5x the upper limit of normal), acute kidney injury (i.e., an
increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/L or 50%12), coagulopathy, headache, diarrhea, nausea or
vomiting, prolonged QTc (i.e., >500 ms), new onset arrhythmia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia.
Worsening clinical status as documented within a physician’s note or in-hospital mortality were also
evaluated as safety endpoints.

Statistical analysis
Continuous data were analyzed using the Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum, as appropriate.
Categorical data were analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact test, as appropriate. Missing data were
treated as missing. All statistical analyses were performed using Intercooled Stata version 14.2 (College
Station, TX). Statistical significance was set at alpha < 0.05. Univariate logistic regression was used to
estimate OR for harm only when the event rate exceeded 10% for the outcome (e.g., any ADR).

Results:
Demographics
A total of 352 patients admitted to 15 hospitals across the US between April 18 and May 8, 2020
were included. Patient and facility demographics are summarized and stratified according to receipt of
only supportive care vs COVID-19 directed therapy in Table 1. Patients were primarily treated at
academic medical centers (53.4%), followed by community hospitals (42.6%), and a minority at
rehabilitation hospitals (4%). The majority of patients in our study were treated in the Midwest US
region (81%). Over 97% of patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 based on diagnostic testing, with
98% of specimens collected via nasopharyngeal swab and minority collected via bronchoalveolar lavage.
The mean [standard deviation (SD)] age of patients was 61.9 (16.1) years. Fifty-two percent of patients
were males. The mean (SD) body weight and BMI were 89 (29) kg and 31.8 (11.3) kg/m2, respectively.
Over 95% of patients were adults but 4.5% were pediatric or neonatal patients. The majority of patients
(81%) were receiving supportive care only (including supplemental oxygen and/or other nonpharmacological support).

Supportive care vs COVID-19 directed therapy
A total of 67 patients were receiving COVID-19 directed drug therapy. The most common COVID19 directed drug therapies used were HCQ (69%), remdesivir (10%), and IL-6 inhibitors (9%). A total of 51
of the 67 patients (76%) treated with COVID-19 directed therapies required supplemental oxygen.
Patients with a history of asthma were significantly more likely to receive COVID-19 drug therapy vs
supportive care only (14.9% vs 7%; P = 0.037). Patients were significantly more likely to receive COVID19 directed drug therapy if they were enrolled in a clinical trial (26.9% vs 3.2%; P <0.001).

Frequency of ADRs in patients receiving monotherapy vs combination COVID-19 directed therapy
Among patients receiving COVID-19 therapy, a total of 8 patients (12%) experienced any ADR,
five of which (7.5%) were receiving combination treatment. A summary of the types and frequency of
ADRs with combination and monotherapy COVID-19 directed therapy are summarized in Table 2. All 5 of
the patients who were receiving combination therapy were given HCQ in addition to another agent
directed at SARS-CoV-2 including: azithromycin (n=2/5), an IL-6 blocker (n=2/5), or some other
investigational agent (n=1/5). Patients who were receiving combination therapy were numerically more
likely to experience any ADR (20% vs 11.3%; P = 0.56). Patients who were receiving monotherapy and
combination therapy did not differ with respect to any specific ADR evaluated (Table 2), but numerically

more patients experienced diarrhea if they were given combination therapy (20% vs 4.8%; P = 0.27).
Patients with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were numerically more likely to have any ADR
detected (37.5% vs 10.2%; P = 0.068). Likewise, patients enrolled in any clinical trial were significantly
more likely to have any ADR detected compared to patients who were not enrolled in a clinical trial
(62.5% vs 22%; OR = 5.9; P = 0.028).

Frequency of COVID-19 directed therapy and ADRs among patients requiring oxygen therapy
The requirement for supplemental oxygen secondary to COVID-19 was numerically more
common among patients who were receiving combination COVID-19 directed therapy compared to
monotherapy [77.4% (n=48/62) vs 60% (n=3/5); P=0.59). A summary of adverse effects according to
oxygen requirement status is summarized in Table 3. Patients who did not require oxygen were
numerically more likely to experience any ADR within the prior 24 hr (25% vs 7.8%; P = 0.085). These
patients were also numerically more likely to experienced QTc prolongation within the prior 24 hr
(12.5% vs 0%; P=0.054). On the other hand, patients who required supplemental oxygen were
significantly more likely to have clinically worsened in the prior 24 hours (31.4% vs 0%; P=0.008). We did
not observe significantly more death among patients who required supplemental oxygen (P=0.57).

Discussion:
This multicenter point-prevalence study found that, between 4/12/20-5/8/20, drug therapy for
COVID-19 was relatively uncommon across academic, community, and rehabilitation hospitals during a
typical day. The majority of patients were receiving supportive care (81%) and a total of 66.5% required
supplemental oxygen. Only 67 patients (19%) were receiving COVID-19 directed drug therapy, and a
minority of patients were receiving combination treatment with more than one agent targeting SARSCoV-2 (n=5). Nevertheless, we still were able to identify ADRs in 12% of patients who were receiving
drug therapy. While a point-prevalence approach is not comprehensive and causality cannot be firmly
established, our findings serve as a warning that COVID-19 drug therapies are not completely benign.
Among patients receiving combination therapy (mostly involving HCQ) diarrhea was more common. Our
findings suggest that, on a typical day, more patients were receiving supportive care compared to
COVID-19 drug therapies. Enrollment in a clinical trial and a history of asthma were associated with
increased use of drug therapies targeting SARS-CoV-2.
Notably, our sample represents 15 hospitals distributed throughout the United States, with high
representation from the Midwest; a region underrepresented in the available COVID-19 literature. It is
also important to note that our study took place before wide availability of EUA remdesivir.13 Most
patients in our study were receiving supportive care at the time of evaluation; however the cumulative
exposure to drug therapies was not ascertained. Supportive care has been suggested as a cautious
approach to providing unproven and understudied drug therapy in an emergency situation,14, 15 and
more data are needed to define the safety of COVID-19 drug therapies. Our finding that ADRs were
relatively common among COVID-19 patients receiving drug-therapy underscores the need for close
monitoring. We found that patients enrolled in clinical trials were nearly 6-fold more likely to have an
ADR detected, likely reflecting the careful monitoring occurring in trials. Unfortunately, the vast majority
of patients with COVID-19 do not have access to clinical trials but receive these agents, nonetheless.
Therefore, a clear need exists for improved ADR monitoring in patients receiving unproven therapies.
As noted, various medications are being evaluated in the fight against COVID-19; however, at
the time of this writing there is no definitive cure. While some drugs have been touted as efficacious,
clinical trial findings have not mirrored these claims and many of these potential treatments have been
plagued by safety concerns. Lopinavir/ritonavir was initially evaluated in China for its role in hospitalized
adults diagnosed with severe COVID-19, but it failed to demonstrate benefits including time to clinical
improvement or mortality at 28 days when compared to standard of care.16 Serious adverse events were

more common in the standard care group yet lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with more
gastrointestinal ADRs. Of note, we did not observe any use of lopinavir/ritonavir in our patient sample.
Similarly, the use of HCQ, alone or combined with azithromycin, has diminished markedly due to
safety concerns and questionable efficacy.17, 18 Though less than 20% of patients in our study were
receiving COVID-19 drug therapy, the most commonly used drug was HCQ. Recently, results of a
multinational registry analysis of over 96,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ
(n=3016), HCQ + macrolide (n=6221), chloroquine (n=1868), or chloroquine + macrolide (n=3783) were
reported.18 The investigators observed an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and de-novo ventricular
arrhythmias with HCQ or chloroquine-based therapy, though these results have been called into
question more recently.19 Subsequently, the World Health Organization paused enrollment for a clinical
trial of HCQ, and the fate of HCQ as a COVID-19 therapy is currently uncertain.20
Whereas the agents above have known limitations, other agents including IL-6 inhibitors
(tocilizumab, sarilumab), IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab), and remdesivir are gaining increased
attention. The IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, appeared beneficial in critically ill patients with severe COVID19 based upon improvements in oxygen requirements, fever resolution, lung imaging, and inflammatory
markers.21 Preliminary data from randomized, placebo-controlled, trial of sarilumab showed clinical
improvements in patients with critical COVID-19.22 However, these treatments are not without risks as
agents targeting the cytokine response may increase the risk for secondary infections, gastrointestinal
perforations, and hepatic toxicity.23 Comprehensive information regarding the safety of these as yet
unproven agents is needed as their use becomes more common in patients with COVID-19.
Remdesivir has garnered considerable interest as a treatment for COVID-19 since May 2020
when it was granted EUA status.13 A recent randomized placebo controlled trial by Wang et al. did not
establish significant benefit of remdesivir and was terminated early.24 Serious adverse events occurred
in 18% and 26% of patients receiving remdesivir and placebo, respectively. ACTT-1 was a randomized,
placebo-controlled, study of 1,063 hospitalized patients with COVID-19.25 Preliminary results showed a
shorter median time to recovery with remdesivir (11 vs 15 days). Serious adverse events occurred in
21% and 27% of patients receiving remdesivir and placebo, respectively. ADRs occurring more often with
remdesivir were decreased renal function, pyrexia, and hyperglycemia.25 The Gilead-sponsored SIMPLE
trial comparing 5 and 10 days of remdesivir did not identify a primary efficacy difference for the
regimens evaluated; however, significantly more patients treated for 10 days experienced any serious
adverse event including AKI.26 We did not identify higher rates of ADRs with remdesivir in our study, but
patients could have been receiving remdesivir as compassionate use or may have received placebo in

the setting of a clinical trial. Based upon available evidence, patients receiving remdesivir, particularly
for more than 5 days, will require more intensive monitoring.
Our study has some limitations. First, this was a point-prevalence survey and cause and effects
are not discerned. Our survey data window was limited to the prior 24 hours, so it is likely that our
evaluation of adverse effects is conservative. Because our ability to discern causation was limited, it is
not completely clear to what extent the adverse events we found were related to COVID-19 vs drug
therapies. Nevertheless, we observed numerically more adverse effects among patients who did not
require supplemental oxygen. These patients were at various points of their disease course (i.e., we
included anyone who was hospitalized and required treatment), so prior exposure to agents that may
have led to the noted adverse effects (e.g., diarrhea from antibiotics) was not comprehensively
assessed. More work is needed to define the time course of ADRs in this population in order to improve
patient safety. Despite these limitations, strengths of our study include the representative sample of
patients with COVID-19 across various geographic and demographic populations. Data from clinical trials
and ADR registries are needed to more clearly define the risks of COVID-19 drug therapies.
In conclusion, we observed high rates of supportive care in more than 80% of included patients
with COVID-19 in our point-prevalence survey. Among patients who were receiving drug therapy, we
found that as many as 12% experienced an ADR within the prior 24 hours with the most commonly
reported adverse event being diarrhea. Patients enrolled in clinical trials were over 6-fold more likely to
have an ADR identified, suggesting a greater need for ADR monitoring in patients with COVID-19.
Comprehensive systems are needed to identify and mitigate adverse effects associated with COVID-19
drug therapies.
