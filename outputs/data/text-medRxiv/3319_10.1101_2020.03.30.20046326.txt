Abstract. Social distancing policies are critical but economically painful

measures to ﬂatten the curve against emergent infectious diseases. As the
novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spread throughout the United
States in early 2020, the federal government issued social distancing recommendations but left to the states the most difficult and consequential
decisions restricting behavior, such as canceling events, closing schools
and businesses, and issuing stay-at-home orders. We present an original
dataset of state-level social distancing policy responses to the epidemic
and explore how political partisanship, COVID-19 caseload, and policy
diffusion explain the timing of governors’ decisions to mandate social distancing. An event history analysis of ﬁve social distancing policies across
all ﬁfty states reveals the most important predictors are political: all else
equal, Republican governors and governors from states with more Trump
supporters were slower to adopt social distancing policies. These delays
are likely to produce signiﬁcant, on-going harm to public health.

Introduction
Social distancing, or practices which reduce the probability of contact between infected
and non-infected people, has emerged as the primary tool for reducing the spread of the
novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.(1; 2; 3) As of March 2020, other methods for
ﬁghting infectious disease are mostly unavailable or ineffective due to the characteristics
of this pathogen:
(1) it is an emergent virus to which there is no pre-existing immunity, available vaccine,
or proven treatment;
(2) it spreads easily through human contact and airborne droplets, leading to exponential growth in cases; and
(3) those affected may be contagious during a prolonged asymptomatic incubation period, and many never develop symptoms distinctive from a mild ﬂu, making it difficult
to identify and isolate the infected before they pass the virus to others.(4)
Broad public mandates for social distancing are also vital to help manage a key multiplier of COVID-19 fatality rates: a substantial fraction of patients require lengthy
(on average 8 bed days) intensive care unit (ICU) support to survive acute respiratory
distress, and uncontrolled spread of the disease is expected to generate at its peak far
greater demand for ICU care than existing capacity can meet.(5; 2; 6) Public health
experts have pleaded with officials to quickly mandate social distancing to ﬂatten the
curve of coronavirus infections – that is, reduce the peak caseload – before exponential
case growth leads to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. In particular, it is
important to keep peak levels low to prevent the fatality rate from rising to the levels
seen in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed with cases.(7)
In the United States, the emergence of the coronavirus has created a natural experiment in which elected officials face incredibly urgent and far-reaching policy decisions
for which they typically have no personal experience or expertise, and for which the
history of policy examples is either mere days old, or so dated as to be largely unknown
except by public health experts. The most signiﬁcant policy decisions of this kind –
both in terms of their potential to mitigate the epidemic and their economic consequences – are mandates for social distancing through restrictions on public gatherings;
closure or restriction of schools, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses; and
orders for the public to stay at home.(8) Under the federal and state constitutions, the

key actions fall to executives, and particularly to governors, whose powers in public
health emergencies are typically singular and extensive.
In particular, the exponential growth of cases of an emergent virus has unique implications for policy making. Estimates of the uncontrolled doubling-time of COVID-19
cases vary and are complicated by the slow rollout of effective testing in the US, but
many studies ﬁnd doubling times in the range from four to seven days.(9; 10; 3; 2) These
estimates correspond to alarming growth rates of 10.4% to 26.0% per day. Even if the
true doubling time of infections prior to social distancing is as long as a week, delaying
these measures just three days would, all else equal, raise the eventual peak number of
cases by more than 30%, potentially increasing total deaths by thousands or more in a
given state.
Evidence from the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic underscores the stakes for elected ofﬁcials. In that earlier natural experiment, American cities faced similar decisions regarding social distancing policies. For example, Philadelphia decided to hold a parade
welcoming soldiers returning from World War I, while St. Louis cancelled its parade,
and ultimately experienced one eighth as many deaths per capita during that wave of
inﬂuenza. The height of the infection in Saint Louis was two months later than in
Philadelphia, and was far lower, with deaths peaking at ﬁfty per hundred thousand
rather than 250 per hundred thousand.(11; 12) Shortly after community transmission
of the coronavirus was discovered in Washington and California in late February 2020,
public health experts drew the comparison between Philadelphia and Saint Louis, hoping to inspire policymakers to promote social distancing. Nevertheless, in an echo of
the decisions made a century before, there are signiﬁcant differences in the timing of
governors’ decisions to mandate social distancing. For instance, on 6 March 2020, after Kentucky had its ﬁrst conﬁrmed case of COVID-19, Governor Andy Beshear (D)
immediately called a state of emergency, encouraged social distancing, and closed bars
and restaurants ten days later. But when neighboring Tennesse uncovered its ﬁrst conﬁrmed case of COVID-19 on March 5th, Governor Bill Lee (R) waited until 12 March
to declare a state of emergency and ﬁnally closed restaurants and bars on 22 March.(13)
Why did governors’ responses to a sudden, shared threat differ? Under normal circumstances, governors’ policy decisions are shaped by the national leaders and agenda
of their political party and the demands of their own constituents, particularly those
in their partisan base. Governors may also look to innovative peers and neighbors for
examples to follow. But the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus threat, the need to
rely on experts to understand complex scientiﬁc material, and uncertainty about the
nature and scope of the threat might scramble all or some of these usual motivations.

The public health case for mandatory social distancing in the United States developed quickly in the wake of the ﬁrst reports of community transmission on 26 February
in Washington state. One might expect social distancing measures to quickly follow
across the ﬁfty states, perhaps more quickly in states with greater number of conﬁrmed
cases. But mandating social distancing is a difficult decision for any political leader. If
these measures are successful in preventing widespread mortality, many members of
the public who suffered the costs of these mandates may never fully comprehend the
beneﬁts. Indeed, the more successful the intervention, the more likely it will appear
to many as an “overreaction.” Moreover, some states faced higher potential costs from
these policies: closing schools is more painful in states where more children depend
on schools for subsidized lunches and shutting restaurants and public places is more
difficult in states highly dependent on tourism.(14) More generally, states with more
limited economic resources are likely far less able to weather the deprivations caused
by economic shutdowns, or to expand social insurance protections during mandated
social distancing, and thus may be considerably more reluctant to take these steps.
But the greatest barrier to swift social distancing measures seems political. Numerous surveys have found signiﬁcant partisan divides in public opinion about the severity
of the coronavirus threat.(15; 16) Countering the message from public health leaders,
the White House downplayed COVID-19. On 4 March 2020, President Trump insisted
that COVID-19 was similar to the ﬂu; two days later, he falsely claimed the situation in
Italy was improving, and that the US was handling coronavirus much better than other
industrialized countries. As late as 15 March 2020, with reported cases rising rapidly,
Trump still maintained that the epidemic within the US was under control.(17) Similar
messages ﬁlled news sources relied on by Republican voters. Fox Business host Trish
Reagan insisted the pandemic warnings were a Democratic hoax and another effort to
impeach the President, while Sean Hannity, another Fox News personality, validated
the conspiracy theory that coronavirus was an effort by the “deep state” to “manipulate markets, suppress dissent and push mandated medicines.”(18) For governors already reluctant to impose draconian measures, this messaging both provided cover for
inaction and may have reduced public support, particularly among Republican voters.
And as social distancing measures have spread, Republican leaders, including Trump,
have been more vocal in their desire to quickly rollback these measures to restore the
economy.
Moving beyond general impressions of the determinants of social distancing poses
challenges: States with Democratic governors and voters tend to be both richer than
Republican states, and to be more urban and coastal. The seemingly quicker action of

“blue states” could simply be a result of the coronavirus ﬁrst emerging in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, as well as in states better able to endure prolonged
social distancing mandates. Likewise, disentangling the role of Republican governors
from Republican voters is challenging, though some blue states, like Maryland, have
Republican governors (and vice versa).
To investigate why some states acted quickly to implement social distancing while
others took longer, we identiﬁed ﬁve critical areas of social distancing policy – recommendations and restrictions against public gatherings, mandatory school closures,
restrictions on the normal operation of restaurants, closure of non-essential businesses,
and stay-at-home orders – and collected the dates each state ﬁrst announced such measures. Our primary objective is to explain the variation in timing of these measures
across states using an event history analysis. This approach allows us to statistically
separate the impact of having a Republican governor or a Republican electorate from a
series of potential confounders, including the number of conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases
in the state, state income, and cases and policies in neighboring states.
Our ﬁndings are unambiguous: political variables are the strongest predictor of the
early adoption of social distancing policies. All else equal, states with Republican governors and Republican electorates delayed each social distancing measure by an average
of 2.70 days (95% CI: 2.49 to 2.88), a far larger effect than any other factor, including
state income per capita, the percentage of neighboring states with mandates, or even
conﬁrmed cases in each state.

State-Level Social Distancing Measures
We study state social distancing measures enacted over the period from the ﬁrst reported case of transmission in the US on 26 February 2020 up through 23 March 2020,
at which point all states had at least one social distancing policy.1 To capture variation
in these policies across states over time, we draw on data compiled by the National
Governors’ Association (NGA), which we veriﬁed and further documented by collect1 We consider the ﬁrst community transmission in the US more epidemiologically and politically
relevant than initial reported transmission in each state. At the time of ﬁrst community transmission in the US, virologists including Trevor Bedford suggested this strain had been circulating in Washington state since mid-January.(19) Given scarce and unreliable testing, governors
faced a choice to either take immediate action as national cases increased or wait for (potentially
belated) reports of in-state cases. We prefer to treat the decision to wait for a conﬁrmed case as
something to be explained, and so control for conﬁrmed in-state cases in our model.

ing information directly from state government websites.(20) We focus here on ﬁve
measures:
(1) Recommendations or restrictions on gatherings: We code the date on which the
ﬁrst such measure was announced, regardless of the size of gathering speciﬁed.2
(2) School closures: We code the date that the governor announces formal closure of
public K-12 schools.
(3) Restaurant restrictions: We code the date on which states ﬁrst announced mandatory restrictions on in-person dining, including maximum capacity limits likely to render most restaurants non-viable.
(4) Non-essential business closures: This coding does not distinguish among differences
in state classiﬁcations of essential and non-essential businesses, which differ by state.
(5) Stay-at-home orders: This coding includes mandates to stay at home but not advisory orders that recommend that citizens remain at home.
Although we also coded implementation dates for each of these policies, our focus is
on the dates policies were announced, for two reasons. First, we expect much of the effect of these emergency measures on social behavior to be immediate. The state’s power
to compel socially responsible behavior is often said to act through “quasi-voluntary
compliance,” in which most citizens choose pro-social behaviors given a cue from the
state that is backed with the threat of sanction.(21) This effect should be all the stronger
to the extent people treat costly social distancing measures as a credible signal of the
viral threat. Second, our focus is on predicting the timing of governor’s actions, which
naturally points to announcement dates, rather than implementation dates which may
be delayed (in the case of school closures, for example), by weekends and spring breaks.
Figure 1 displays the timing of different states’ adoptions of these ﬁve social distancing policies over the four-week study period. No state acted before 10 March, a full thirteen days after the ﬁrst report of community transmission, yet by 15 March, uptake was
rapid across states. In general, states typically started social distancing through recommendations or restrictions on public gatherings, then turned to restrictions on schools
2 We include recommendations in this category for two reasons: ﬁrst, this was often the ﬁrst
action states took, and early actors did not always revisit these policies with a restrictive mandate; second, the target of these measures was typically large events that would be unlikely to
maintain viable attendance under the cloud of a state recommendation to cancel events.

and restaurants. Finally, a minority of states have added closures of non-essential business and stay-at-home orders. By the end of our study period, all states except Arkansas
and Mississippi had recommended against or restricted public gatherings, 44 states had
closed schools and restricted restaurant operations, nineteen states closed non-essential
businesses, and fourteen states issued stay-at-home orders. The ﬁnal plot on the bottom
right highlights the rapid growth in states enacting multiple social distancing measures,
as well as the presence of a substantial number of laggard states still lacking most social
distancing policies as late as 23 March 2020.

Modeling Social Distancing Policy with Event History Analysis
We estimate an event history model to predict the timing of implementing social distancing directives across U.S. states from 26 February 2020 to 23 March 2020.3 We
model the likelihood that a state will implement each social distancing policy as a
function of time (measured in days) with a pooled, stratiﬁed Cox proportional hazards
model, often referred to as the Wei-Lin-Weissfeld marginal model.(22) In our application, this approach allows us to examine the common factors affecting implementation
of social distancing across states by 1) pooling the ﬁve social distancing measures shown
in Figure 1 in a single model, (2) stratifying baseline hazards across the ﬁve policy types
to allow for varying underlying tendencies to adopt some policies more quickly than
others, and (3) clustering standard errors by state.
As usual, the Cox model allows us to estimate a baseline hazard rate, which shifts
in proportion to changes in covariates, and accommodates right-censored cases (states
that have not yet adopted a given social distancing measure at the end of the study
period). The baseline hazard rate also captures any purely national trends, such as the
common tendency of states to adopt social distancing policies as national deaths climb
or public awareness of COVID-19 increases, while leaving cross-state variation to be
explained by covariates.
We expect state level responses to vary based on differences in social, economic and
political costs. We include ﬁve covariates in our baseline model:
The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state. While conﬁrmed cases of

COVID-19 are undercounts of actual cases, conﬁrmed cases were the only data available to officials making decisions in real time.(23) We explored a variety of alternative

measures, including whether the state had ten or more conﬁrmed cases, but found substantively similar results.
Gross state product (GSP) per capita. This variable captures the ability of richer states

to better withstand the impact of business shutdowns, support small businesses and
schools through closure, and maintain social safety nets.(24) The variable enters the
model logged to account for diminishing returns to greater wealth.
Republican Governor. A binary variable indicating the presence of a Republican, as op-

posed to a Democratic, governor.(25) Governors have extensive unchecked emergency
powers, which they may exercise in accordance with their political incentives and ideology regardless of the broader partisan composition of the state.
Percent of voters choosing Trump in 2016. A proxy for general support for the Republican

party within the state.(26) Although governors have the power to act independently in
a public health crisis, they may take into account the electoral consequences of those
actions, especially if they are likely to be unpopular with the dominant partisan base in
their state.
Percentage of neighboring states enacting each social distancing measure. This variable cap-

tures the degree of policy diffusion, or states learning from their neighbors’ responses
to a common policy problem.
In addition to these covariates, we explored a variety of alternative explanatory factors.
These included the count of COVID-19 deaths within the state,(23) the total number of
conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases in neighboring states, Fox News viewers as a percentage
of the population,(27) the spread of social distancing policies among the states from
which each state typically borrows policies,(28) the percentage of state employment
dependent on tourism,(29) the percentage of state residents who were at least 70 years
of age,(30) the percentage of school children receiving reduced price lunches,(31) and
the percentage of state residents with a college degree.(32) None of these variables had
substantively and statistically signiﬁcant relationships with social distancing measures
when added to our baseline model, nor did they substantially alter the results of the
baseline model.

Results
We review the determinants of delays in state-level COVID-19 social distancing measures in order of substantive impact, quantifying the impact of each factor in two ways.
First, we show the degree to which each factor – such as governors’ partisanship, the
presence of Trump voters, or actions by neighboring states – reduces the chance a state
acts to impose a new social distancing mandate on a given date (Figure 2; see Appendix
for tabular results). This is the well-known hazard ratio, a common summary of event
history models. Second, we use our estimated model to simulate the average delay each
factor would cause if it were present in each state. That is, we might ask: if every state
had a Republican governor, how many days later would they have implemented each
social distancing measure than if every state had a Democratic governor. This is known

as an average marginal effect and helps quantify our model results in policy-relevant
terms (Figure 3).4
Republican-leaning states are slower to adopt social distancing policies. At any given time

within the study period, Republican governors were 42.2% (95% CI: 13.5 to 63.2) less
likely to mandate social distancing than their Democratic counterparts. Holding constant other variables – including the 2016 Trump vote share – at their observed values
in each state, on average, Republican governors delay each state-level social distancing
4 That is, we use the estimated Cox model to simulate the average of the marginal effects of each
covariate on the timing of adopting each social distancing measure across the ﬁfty states, and
bootstrap conﬁdence intervals around these marginal effects.(33)

measure by 1.68 days (95% CI: 1.57 to 1.78). At the same time, holding constant the
Governor’s party affiliation, states with more Trump voters were less likely to adopt
social distancing. A state at the 75th percentile of 2016 Trump vote share was 28.1%
(95% CI: 1.1 to 49.3) less likely to adopt an additional mandate at a given time when
compared to a state at the 25th percentile of Trump support, which resulted in an average delay of 0.99 days (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.07). Republican governors often go together
with Trump-voting electorates; on average, these states endured a combined partisan
delay of 2.70 days (95% CI: 2.49 to 2.88). Barring positive developments in the ﬁght
against COVID-19, the public health impact of this delay is likely to be massive: in
a state where coronavirus infections are doubling every seven days, this would raise
the peak caseload by 30.6%. In a state where infections are doubling every three days,
Republican partisanship might raise the peak level of cases by 86.6%.
Confirmed state-level caseload had only a small effect on social distancing timing. Controlling

for partisanship, the number of conﬁrmed COVID-19 cases in a state had only a small
effect on the implementation of social distancing measures. (We emphasize this measure captures state-level cases: the total national cases are captured non-parametrically
by the baseline hazard.) To show just how small this effect is, we compare a state with
just four conﬁrmed cases (the median among all state-days in our study period) to a
state with 426 cases (the 95th percentile). The state with fewer cases was just 12.2%
(95% CI: 6.5 to 17.8) less likely to implement social distancing on a given day, for a
cumulative delay of just 0.38 days (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.41). While many of the early
epicenters were Democratic-leaning states, it does not appear that the more aggressive
action of Democratic states is a simple function of caseload.5 This is, from a public
health perspective, a fairly reasonable result: early implementation of social distancing
is likely to be far more effective, so pro-active governors may have realized there was
little sense in waiting for a certain threshold of cases to act, especially given delays and
failures in testing.
Poorer states are less likely to adopt social distancing policies. All else equal, states at the

25th percentile of gross state product per capita were 26.2% (95% CI: 5.8 to 42.8) less
likely to implement social distancing than states at the 75th percentile, which translates
5 The partisan result does not change if we consider simple transformations, such as whether the
state had at least ten conﬁrmed cases, or whether the state had a recorded death, or simply the
total COVID-19 deaths; nor did any of these variables substantially explained social distancing
adoption.

to an average delay of 0.90 days (95% CI: 0.83 to 0.95). This might explain Louisiana’s
relatively slow adoption of social distancing policies despite a conﬁrmed outbreak and a
Democratic governor. Social distancing delays due to limited state economic resources
are particularly troubling, as poorer states may also have larger vulnerable populations
and more fragile health systems.
Neighboring state actions increase the likelihood of social distancing policy. As in other policy

areas, governors may look to their peers to determine appropriate action. The policy
diffusion literature suggests different ways to determine each state’s “peer group.” Because the coronavirus spreads spatially, we focus on actions by neighboring states, and
estimate the likelihood a state will implement a speciﬁc kind of social distancing as a
function of the percentage of contiguous states also mandating that policy. We ﬁnd
that a state with no neighbors adopting a given policy was 32.0% (95% CI: 8.4 to 50.8)
less likely to adopt it than a state with 50% or more of its neighbors adopting that policy.
This corresponds to a delay of 1.20 days (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.26). Investigation of other
possible mechanisms – including policy diffusion based on the number of conﬁrmed
COVID-19 cases in neighboring states or based on the actions of peers a given state
typically looks to for policy innovations – failed to uncover additional patterns of diffusion. We speculate that actions by neighboring states may grant cover to governors
to take similar actions.(28)

Discussion
In this paper, we focused on decisions by governors, who through the structure of US
and state constitutions and the abdication of presidential leadership found themselves
on the frontlines of the battle against COVID-19. Future research should consider the
role of local governments, but in March 2020, it was often governors who led their
states – or allowed them to fall behind.
Why do Republican governors and states with Republican voters seem to resist social distancing policy, even controlling for many potential confounders? We strongly
believe that realistic assessments of decision-making by elected officials must take electoral motivations and career ambitions seriously – as impolitic as that may be. Elected
officials, regardless of party, must be responsive to the concerns of their voters and party
leaders. However this essential feature of democratic representation does not inevitably
produce the best policy outcome. Where the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic
were concerned, Republicans had fewer incentives to act quickly than Democrats. First,

partisans of any stripe tend to minimize failures by their own party leaders and exaggerate failures by the opposing party.(34; 35; 36; 37) As a result, Republican voters took
COVID-19 less seriously in the early stages of the US pandemic. Indeed, Republican
voters were more concerned about Ebola during Obama’s presidency than they were
about COVID-19 under Trump.(38) Second, all humans have difficulty accurately assessing risks that are small but not zero.(39; 40) In this case, Republican voters were
more likely than Democrats to incorrectly assume that the COVID-19 fatality rate and
disease burden was effectively the same as the ﬂu.(15) Third, partisans’ worldviews are
shaped by cues provided by their leaders.(34) In the early stages of the US pandemic,
President Trump strongly signaled in press conference and on social media that the
coronavirus was an exaggerated threat or even a hoax, a position that was magniﬁed
and reinforced by Republican-leaning media outlets. Finally, Republican officials almost surely considered the possibility of reprisals – both to their political careers and
discretionary federal assistance to their states – from a president who frequently attacks
members of his own party that he perceives to be disloyal.(41; 42; 43) To be clear, we
are not arguing that politics was the sole motivation behind governors’ social distancing decisions: our results suggest otherwise. However, we do believe that the political
headwinds were signiﬁcantly greater for Republican Governors in Republican leaning
states.
It is likely that governors will face this difficult decision again. Governors may
choose to roll back social distancing at different points in time. Some experts contend
that authorities will need to alternate between two months of social distancing and
one month of restored freedoms to reduce the likelihood that health systems are overwhelmed by severe cases until a vaccine is developed, produced, and circulated.(3; 44)
This implies state governments will be asked to impose difficult social distancing policies not once, but many times. Each instance will be a test of whether states can
act promptly to prevent COVID-19 cases from peaking at unmanageable levels. If
Republican governors and states with Republican majorities continue to lag behind,
the cumulative impact on those states, and on the country as whole through spillovers,
could be vast.

Baseline hazards are stratiﬁed across the ﬁve pooled social distancing measures: recommendations
and restrictions on gatherings, school closures, restaurant restrictions, non-essential business closures, and stay-at-home orders. Each row shows the hazard ratio for (the counterfactual change
in) the covariate listed at the left. Counterfactual changes are chosen to simplify comparison of
hazard ratios for covariates with different scales of measurement. Covariates with both 95% conﬁdence limits below 1.0 signiﬁcantly reduce the chance of adopting an additional social distancing
measure. Standard errors used to compute conﬁdence intervals are clustered by state. The concordance index shows the proportion of all pairs of states for which the model correctly predicts which
state will adopt a given social distancing mandate ﬁrst. Schoenfeld residuals show no evidence of
violation of proportionality for any covariate. The Efron method is used to resolve ties.
