ABSTRACT
Background
Amid the crisis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), front-line clinicians
in collaboration with backstage medical researchers analyzed clinical
characteristics of COVID-19 patients and reported the prognosis using
myocardial data records upon hospitalization.

Methods
We reported 135 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted in
The First People’s Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China. Demographic
data, medical history, and laboratory parameters were taken from inpatient
records and compared between patients at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and
non-ICU isolation wards for prognosis on disease severity. In particular,
survivors and non-survivors upon ICU admission were compared for prognosis
on disease mortality.

Results
For COVID-19 patients, blood test results showed more significantly deranged
values in the ICU group than those in non-ICU. Among those parameters for
ICU patients, myocardial variables including troponin T, creatine kinase

isoenzymes, myoglobin, were found significantly higher in non-survivors than
in survivors.

Conclusions
Upon hospitalization abnormal myocardial metabolism in COVID-19 patients
could be prognostic indicators of a worsened outcome for disease severity and
mortality.

Introduction
On December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged and provoked a global
spreading of pneumonia diseases [1-4]. The disease was later named as
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [5]. The pathogen responsible for the
COVID-19 was discovered as the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of April 18, 2020, over 2 million cases of
COVID-19 infection were confirmed globally, constituting an unprecedented
public health emergency [6]. With no effective treatment available, the mortality
rate of COVID-19 has been estimated ~ 5.4% [6].
Upon inpatient admission, poor prognosis was associated with elderly age,
high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and augmented Ddimer level of COVID-19 patients [7]. Since the epidemic strike of COVID-19,
respiratory and pulmonary systems have been heavily investigated to enhance
understanding

this

devastating

infectious

disease,

leaving

cardiovascular parameters of patients a less explored area. Here we reported
135 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, by analyzing
clinical data upon their hospital admission with a linkage to their final outcomes.
Through this study by comparing clinical characteristics among non-severe,
severe and deceased groups of patients, we aimed to reveal the relationship
between myocardial characteristics and disease prognosis of COVID-19.

METHODS
Study Design
The study was approved by The First People’s Hospital of Jiangxia District
(TFPHJD) (Approval No. 2020021) in Wuhan, China. With outbreak of unknown
viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the dispatch of medical team from The
Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University (TAHJU) was sent to execute medical
reinforcement in TFPHJD on Jan 27, 2019. A total of 135 COVID-19 patients
were hospitalized in TFPHJD between February 1 and March 15, 2020, and
data were collected including 30 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and
105 patients in non-ICU isolation ward. Written consent was waived by Ethics
Commission of TFPHJD due to the emergency of a major infectious disease.

Procedure
All COVID-19 patients were received at TFPHJD and diagnosed by following a
standard procedure [8]. The confirmed patients were treated with antiviral drugs,
including oseltamivir, arbidol, and ribavirin. For the severe patients who were
admitted into ICU by following the published criteria [8], they typically developed
hypoxemia, dyspnea, and even respiratory failure requiring respiratory support
or invasive mechanical ventilation, and usually had complications such as liver
and kidney injuries, which required blood purification. They were receiving
antibiotic treatment (sulperazone, linezolid), antifungal therapy (fluconazole,
caspofungin),

continuous renal replacement therapy. For all patients, blood cell analysis was
detected by automated hematology analyzer (SYSMEX 800i, Japan), and the
biochemical indicator was analyzed (Toshiba TAB2000, Japan). The
biochemical markers of myocardial injury were measured (Roche Cobas 6000
Analyzer, Switzerland).

Date Collection
Demographic data, medical history and clinical characteristics including
symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) scans, myocardial biomarkers,
hematological and biochemical tests, were obtained at TFPHJD. The data
access and the study were approved by Ethics Commission of TFPHJD.

Statistical Analysis
The categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages,
and continuous variables were applied to describe the median and quartile
range (IQR) values. Comparison of continuous variables between two groups
was analyzed with unpaired Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney test, as
appropriate. Repeated measurements (non-normal distribution) were used
following a generalized linear mixed model. 2 test was used to compare the
proportion of categorical variables, and the Fisher exact test was employed
when data was limited. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
(statistical package for social sciences) version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc.). A

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics of 135 COVID-19 Patients
Admitted at TFPHJD, a total of 135 COVID-19 patients aged 17 to 89 years old
were included in this study. The median age was 56.0 years (IQR 42.0-68.0),
and 67 (49.6%) of them were male (Table 1). 30 (22.2%) patients were later
transferred into the ICU based on the severity of disease development [8]. The
other 105 (77.8%) remained in the non-ICU isolation wards until recovery and
discharge from the hospital. Non-ICU patients were between 17 to 89 years old
with a median age of 54.0 years (IQR 41.0-67.5), where 52 (49.5%) of them
were male. In comparison, ICU patients were between 36 to 88 years old with
a median age of 64.0 years (IQR 50.0-72.3), where 15 (50.0%) of them were
male. This result indicated that the median age of patients in ICU was
significantly higher than that in non-ICU ward (P<0.05), while gender difference
had little correlation to the transmission and development of the COVID-19
diseases.
Among 135 hospitalized patients, 89 (65.9%) had no known acute or
chronic diseases, showing their healthy history prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
For patients with comorbidity, 28 (20.7%) had hypertension, 16 (11.9%)
diabetes, and 4 (3.0%) cardiovascular diseases. Less common comorbidity
could be found as shown in Table 1. Among those co-existing medical
conditions, shown as [ICU versus (vs.) non-ICU patients], hypertension [11
(36.7%) vs.17 (16.2%)] put patients at the highest risk to infection and once

infected those patients could develop worsened conditions. 56.7% of ICU
patients had one comorbidity or more, whereas only 27.6% non-ICU patients
had at least one comorbidity. We calculated the individual comorbidity
percentage in ICU and non-ICU patients, and plotted them versus each other
as shown in Figure 1A. Dotted diagonal (in red) indicated a hypothetically equal
percentage between the two groups. As a result, hypertension stayed the
farthest away from the diagonal, showing this comorbidity possibly the highest
risk factor to cause COVID-19 patients on further critical condition. Following
the same analysis, the other co-existing diseases, such as diabetes, bronchitis,
and renal dysfunction/failure, make up probable risk factors to have negative
impact on COVID-10 patients, which may aggravate the disease severity after
virus infection.
At the onset of COVID-19 illness, the most common symptoms appeared
in 135 patients were cough (135 patients, 100%), fever (128, 94.8%), fatigue
(82, 60.7%), chest pain or distress (46, 34.1%), diarrhea (32, 23.7%), vomiting
(24, 17.8%), and dyspnea (10, 7.4%) (Table 1). Notably, 5.2% later-confirmed
positive patients experienced no fever. For patients showing dyspnea, 6 were
transferred to ICU while the other 4 stayed in non-ICU isolation until fully
recovered. Each symptom had a higher incidence in ICU than in non-ICU. We
calculated the percentage of the above symptoms in ICU and non-ICU groups,
respectively, and plotted the symptom percentage in ICU vs. that in non-ICU.
As shown in Figure 1B, the diagonally dotted line indicated a hypothetically

equal symptom percentage between two groups. This figure depicted that the
later-admitted ICU patients were more likely to show initial symptoms compared
with non-ICU patients, as most points that belong to ICU patients scattered
above the diagonal.

Blood Abnormality of COVID-19 Patients Upon Hospitalization
We performed the laboratory tests of COVID-19 patients on their first day of
hospitalization, and typical parameters indicating blood, hepatic and renal
function were reported (Table 2). 25 (18.5%) out of 135 patients showed
leukocytosis, an increase in their white blood cell count, as a result of infection.
Thrombocytopenia was found in 9 (8.6%) vs. 5 (16.7%) (non-ICU vs. ICU)
patients, taking up to 14 (10.4%) in total. Rises in neutrophil level and falls in
lymphocyte content were spotted in 64 (47.4%) and 77 (57.0%) of the COVID19 patients, as a majority of ICU patients showed a sign of neutrophilia (86.7%)
or lymphocytopenia (86.7%). All the anomaly in blood cell counts suggested
microbial infection and the induced inflammatory response. In parallel, levels of
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were
monitored, as 22 (16.3%) or 37 (27.4%) patients showed a surge, reflecting
substantial damage to the liver. Mild increase in the concentrations of blood
urea nitrogen was observed in 18 (13.3%) patients, suggesting a moderate
renal injury. At the same time, an incline in creatinine content was measured for
a portion of patients (8.1%), with an insignificant difference between ICU and

non-ICU groups. All the blood test results pointed to viral infection as well as
possible bacterial co-infection. To present the prognosis between ICU and nonICU outcomes, we plotted the percentage of each blood parameter in ICU
patients vs. that in non-ICU (Figure 2A), where the dotted diagonal line showed
a hypothetically equal percentage between two groups. As most points located
above the diagonal, those abnormal changes in hematological parameters
indicating infection and organ damages, could serve as prognostic biomarkers
for COVID-19 patients who might need further intensive care attention.

Myocardial Parameters Between Mild and Severe COVID-19 Cases
We next examined biochemical markers of myocardial injury for COVID-19
patients, including troponin T (TnT), creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK),
myoglobin (Mb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase
(CPK) (Table 2). Among 135 patients, 40 (29.6%) patients showed TnT
elevation in their sera, including 16 (53.3%) ICU patients and 24 (22.9%) nonICU patients, as a sign of possible myocardial infraction. 15 (11.1%) patients
showed increased levels of CK, where there were 8 (26.7%) cases in the ICU
and 7 (6.7%) in the non-ICU, probably suggesting a re-infraction or infract
extension. 37 (27.4%) patients had augmented Mb levels with 16 (53.3%) and
21 (20%) patients in the ICU and non-ICU, respectively. Simultaneously, higher
LDH and CPK levels were found in 43 (31.9%) and 20 (14.8%) of COVID-19
patients, respectively. Among those patients, LDH content for 24 (80.0%) ICU

and 19 (18.1%) non-ICU patients were greater than 285 U/L, whereas CPK
level for 6 (20.0%) ICU and 14 (13.3%) non-ICU patients were greater than 174
U/L. All P values for the above parameters (except CPK) demonstrated
significantly higher content of those myocardial biomarkers in the ICU patients
than in non-ICU, showing a heightened risk of adverse cardiac events in severe
COVID-19 patients.
Similarly, in order to predict ICU or non-ICU outcomes, we plotted the
percentage of each abnormal blood parameter in ICU patients vs. that in nonICU patients (Figure 2B), where the dotted diagonal line showed a
hypothetically equality between two groups. All points situated within upper
diagonal area, suggesting that those abnormal increases in myocardial
parameters could be meaningful to assess the prognosis for newly hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the higher above the diagonal line, the higher
risk associated with this parameter for a more possibly critical ill case. For
instance, patients with high TnT levels predicted a poorer prognosis than those
with high CK levels, although both abnormal TnT and CK could serve as
prognostic biomarkers for severe COVID-19 disease.

Radiological Findings for COVID-19 Patients in Different Disease Courses
Following the nucleic acid tests of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens and laboratory tests
of blood samples from patients, CT scans were conducted for all patients upon
hospitalization. Selected CT images were shown for non-ICU patients, and

survival and non-survival groups in ICU patients, where the extent of COVID19 in different patients could be distinctive (Figure 3). In many a case, bilateral
lung involvements were seen at the beginning of infection, although unilateral
lung infection was not uncommon. For non-ICU patients, as shown in Figure
3A, at the lower lobe of the right lung located GGOs, together with patchy
consolidation and stripy density inside. In Figure 3B, scattered shadows with
flocculent density or linear density could be seen in both lungs. For survivors in
ICU (Figures 3C-D), diffusive GGO patterns in a typical crescent shape could
be observed in both lungs, especially in the subpleural and peripheral areas. At
the same time, pulmonary vascular shadows were thickened, suggesting
possible obstructions in the patient’ airway. In contrast, for non-survivors
(Figures 3E-F), diffusive flocculent density and GGO patterns became
overwhelming in the lungs, while curved fluid density shadows were observed
in the bilateral thoracic cavity. Flake-like white consolidation were formed as
shown in a paving and reticular pattern. Unfortunately, patients with their CT
scans shown in Figure 3E-F finally died of respiratory failure on 15 and 24 days,
respectively, after those images were taken upon hospital admission.

Myocardial Variables among Severe COVID-19 Patients
As patients in ICU admission were more frequently showing myocardial injury
compared to non-ICU patients upon hospital admission, we next investigated
whether this occurrence of myocardial anomaly might foretell the eventual

outcome of ICU patients in the course of COVID-19 development. For 30
patients in ICU, 18 of them died and 12 survived. All patients had one or more
increased myocardial enzymes. Specifically, shown in the following as nonsurvival vs. survival group (Table 3), 14 (77.8%) vs. 2 (16.7%) in TnT, 8 (44.4%)
vs. 0 (0.0%) in CK, 13 (72.2%) vs. 3 (25.0%) in Mb, 14 (77.8%) vs. 10 (83.3%)
in LDH, and 5 (27.8%) vs. 1 (8.3%) in CPK. The median values of those
myocardial enzyme concentrations (except LDH and CPK) were significantly
higher in the non-survival than in the survival (P<0.05). In comparison, there
were no significant difference between non-survival and survival groups for all
other laboratory parameters (i.e., WBC, AST, etc.). Besides, the factors of
patient age, gender and comorbidity did not contribute to make a noticeable
difference between survival and non-survival outcome. Relationship between
myocardial injury and prognosis for ICU patients was manifested in Figure 4,
where percentages of patients with abnormal blood parameters in non-survival
and survival group were plotted versus each other. Diagonal line presumed a
hypothetically equal percentage in two groups, and around this diagonal were
scattered and surrounded by routine parameters including WBC, neutrophils,
ALT and AST, etc., which did not show significant difference between nonsurvival and survival; however, away from the diagonal, all serological
parameters representative of abnormal myocardial metabolism (except LDH) in
COVID-19 ICU patients portrayed a poor prognosis. The higher above the
diagonal, the poorer prognosis to be expected. For example, for COVID-19

patients admitted to ICU, the increased TnT level would suggest worse
prognosis than the elevated CPK level, although both parameters could indicate
a likely severe diseases development. This was also in line with the findings in
Figure 2B, as aberrant TnT values could raise more warning signs than
abnormal CPK in the course of disease severity from non-critical to critical
conditions.

Discussion
With 95% identity in its S gene to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 oriented its
receptor-binding domain (RBD) and optimized its conformation to secure the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the host for cell entry, showing the
same manner as SARS-CoV but with higher affinity [9-11]. ACE2 was first
known as a vasoconstrictive protein that regulated the renal and cardiovascular
function, abundantly expressed in the pneumocytes of lung epithelia and
enterocytes of small intestine [12, 13]. This may explain why in addition to the
predominant respiratory or pulmonary manifestation, the gastrointestinal
symptoms occurred in a substantial portion of COVID-19 patients [14], including
diarrhea or vomiting found in our study. This virus entry is further facilitated by
a polybasic site containing several arginine residues in S protein of SARS-CoV2, subject to the highly efficient cleavage of a serine protease TMPRSS2 in the
target cell, which in turn drives the fusion of viral and host cellular membranes
[15, 16].
In previous reports male and elderly group were found susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 [7, 17]. Our study here indicated a minimal difference between
different genders of COVID-19 patients in both non-ICU and ICU groups. The
fact that male could be more susceptible to COVID-19 may be associated with
several non-gender factors, such as smoking history or occupational exposure
to the pathogen [18]. Our research confirmed that elderliness posed a high risk
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many have concluded this to the changing ACE2

activity with aging, where the specific binding of ACE2 to virus outweighs the
protective functions of ACE2 to major organs [19].
Our study agreed with others in that hypertension, diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases made three leading comorbidities which contributed to
the severity of COVID-19 [7, 17, 20]. As ACE2 plays a vital role in regulating
blood pressure and renal function, chronic disease development and long-term
medication may confound the ACE2 activity in each individual [21]. Meanwhile,
SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the downregulation of ACE2 expression in
a similar manner as SARS-CoV did, therefore exacerbating organ damages
[22]. However, the association of COVID-19 transmissibility with ACE2 activity
remains uncertain, while high frequency of those chronic diseases among
population,

interlinked

pathogenesis

between

those

diseases,

and

compromised immune systems in those patients of comorbidity, could make
them vulnerable to the viral infection.
COVID-19 patients were found to have higher viral load in the nasal swabs
or sputum samples than in the throat swabs [23, 24]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2
was inclined to infect the lower airway, including trachea, bronchi, and alveoli
[17]. This agreed with our findings where involuntary cough was the most
common symptom in COVID-19 patients, followed by febrile illness as a sign of
infection. All those results pointed out that in the quest to prevent COVID-19
contraction and stop SARS-CoV-2 spreading, oronasal covering or social
distancing is an imperative measure to thwart the otherwise respiratory tract

transmission intra- or inter-personally, or it would become harder to contain the
virus for avoiding further deep lung infection.
Once inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 contained particles delivers virus to the
lung, where alveolar epithelia actively expressed ACE2 proteins, it further
induces harmful lung injuries [12]. In our study, CT images for COVID-19
patients of different disease developments pointed out pathological changes in
infected lungs, from intensification of patchy GGO, to compressed
consolidation, and to formed pave pattern. Thereby the gas exchange could be
gradually impaired at the interface of alveolo-capillary membrane, leading to
fluid filling in alveolar units and eventual pulmonary edema, which posts a proof
of severe pneumonia and a warning of respiratory failure. This echoes other
radiological findings in COVID-19 patients where 61.1%-85.0% critically ill
patients did not survive ARDS after mechanical ventilation [7, 20, 25-27]. In our
study 15 (83.3%) out of 18 COVID-19 deceased cases suffered and died from
respiratory failure (data not shown). Postmortem biopsy of one COVID-19
patient showed evident ARDS signs in both lungs, represented by diffuse
alveolar damages, hyaline membrane formations, and viral cytopathic changes
in the intra-alveolar space [28]. This pathological finding correlates the
prevalence of ARDS-caused mortality in COVID-19 patients and postulated a
possibility of viral invasion in deep lungs.
Oronasal entry of SARS-CoV-2 led to its direct infection of pulmonary and
digestive systems, as well as earning a chance to enter bloodstream and then

contract extrapulmonary organs through blood flow. Upon hospital admission,
our clinical data from a substantial portion of COVID-19 patients showed the
abnormality in several blood parameters, including peripheral blood cells,
hepatic enzymes, renal metabolites and myocardial proteins, indicating acute
assaults to immune systems together with damages to major organs including
liver, kidney and heart. All parameters (except Cr and CPK) showed significant
difference between ICU and non-ICU patients, establishing them as prognostic
markers for status of COVID-19 severity. This result is in concert with previous
reports [1, 20]. However, none of those parameters suggested a difference
between survivors and non-survivors in ICU group, except myocardial markers
including TnT, CK and Mb. This finding here recommended that upon
hospitalization the myocardial enzyme levels could serve as prognostic
indicators for in-hospital COVID-19 severity and mortality even before medical
care is given.
Regardless of previously underlying diseases, a considerable amount of
cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients have been noticed with correlation to
disease severity and mortality [29]. In our view, two pathways could be both
involved, each to a different extent. Firstly, a direct viral invasion by riding the
blood flow is plausible, a process mediated by ACE2 that is highly and
specifically expressed in the pericytes of heart [30]. Study has revealed that
SARS-CoV genome was detected in 35% autopsied heart samples of 20 SARS
patients, concurrent with lowered ACE2 activity, inundated macrophages, and

significantly shortened illness durations before death [31]. This learning offers
a tip for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, SARS-CoV-2triggered hypercytokinemia (more well-known as cytokine storm) may result in
multiorgan damages, making an indirect but deadly hit to heart [29]. As a proof,
activations of both T-helper-1 (Th1) and T-helper-2 (Th2) cells were identified
in COVID-19 patients, and elevated cytokine levels were found in ICU patients
compared to non-ICU ones, such as interleukin-2, -7, and tumor necrosis factor
 [1]. While a cascade of cytokine release was initiated, it also led to
dysregulation of immune systems, promoting cardiomyocyte death and
eventually heart failure. Insofar, biopsied heart sample from one COVID-19
patient did not endorse a direct cardiac impairment of SARS-CoV-2, where
overactivation of Th17 and cytotoxic T cells was found in the peripheral blood,
voting for an indirect heart injury [28]. More evidences are necessitated to
explore the underlying mechanism of organ impairment by SARS-CoV-2, which
could inspire effective treatments to decelerate and stop the increasing COVID19 fatality.
In summary, we here highlighted myocardial variables from 135 COVID-19
patients prior to their in-hospital treatment, and utilized them as prognostic
indicators for disease severity and mortality of COVID-19, with a hope to assist
decision-making of clinicians when treating patients.
