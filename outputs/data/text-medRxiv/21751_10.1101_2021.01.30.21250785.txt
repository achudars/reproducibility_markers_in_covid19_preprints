ABSTRACT

6

Covid-19 has resulted in the death of more than 1,500,000 individuals. Due to the pandemic's

7

severity, thousands of genomes have been sequenced and publicly stored with extensive records,

8

an unprecedented amount of data for an outbreak in a single year. Simultaneously, prediction

9

models offered region-specific and often contradicting results, while states or countries

10

implemented mitigation strategies with little information on success, precision, or agreement

11

with neighboring regions. Even though viral transmissions have been already documented in a

12

historical and geographical context, few studies aimed to model geographic and temporal flow

13

from viral sequence information. Here, using a case study of 7 states, we model the flow of the

14

Covid-19 outbreak with respect to phylogenetic information, viral migration, inter- and intra-

15

regional connectivity, epidemiologic and demographic characteristics. By assessing regional

16

connectivity from genomic variants, we can significantly improve predictions in modeling the

17

viral spread and intensity.

18

Contrary to previous results, our study shows that the vast majority of the first outbreak can be

19

traced to very few lineages, despite the existence of multiple worldwide transmissions.

20

Moreover, our results show that while the distance from hotspots is initially important,

21

connectivity becomes increasingly significant as the virus establishes itself. Similarly, isolated

22

local strategies -such as relying on herd immunity- can negatively impact neighboring states. Our

INTRODUCTION

43

Covid-19 related deaths have surpassed 1,500,000 worldwide and 330,000 in the United States.

44

Due to the importance of the pandemic, many resources are available for COVID-19 genome

45

research, including GenBank, GISAID, and Nextstrain 1–3. Due to the severity of the pandemic

46

combined with the advent of sequencing technologies, the amount of sequencing data within

47

such a short time period for a single outbreak is unprecedented. GISAID is currently the largest

48

COVID-19 database with more than 309,000 SARS-CoV2 genomes 2. This is compared to 1760

49

sequences of influenza A/H3N2 collected from 2013 to 2020. These numbers are comparable or

50

surpassing the number of HIV or HCV sequences in the Los Alamos national database 4,5. These

51

COVID-19 genomes represent the spread of the pandemic from China to 188 countries

52

worldwide, with more sequences added every day.

53

Recent studies have modelled the transmission, diversity and spatial phylogeography of the virus

54

mostly in a historical context 6–12. According to studies, Covid-19 first arrived in Washington 11,

55

in what is considered a cryptic infection 11,13. However, known cases in persons with no relevant

56

travel history also occurred in California in late January/early February11.While the first lineages

57

arrived from China in Washington and California, subsequent infectious lineages (notably in

58

New York) appear to represent importations from Europe 11,14. In this context, early results also

59

suggested multiple worldwide transmissions responsible for the outbreak in the North-East of

60

United States 12.

61

From the beginning of the pandemic, different approaches have been developed for the modeling

62

of the outbreak that use either epidemiological, demographic data 15–20 . Many -sometimes

63

contradicting- prediction models offered temporal, and locally isolated results based on local

64

outbreaks 16–18,21,22, while each country implemented their strategy to combat the outbreak,

65

including controversial approaches such as “herd immunity”23–25. At the same time, different

66

forms of local lockdowns have been tested to successfully mitigate viral spread as non-

67

pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 22,26–28. While previous studies offer extremely valuable

68

insights into the history of viral transmission and the effectiveness of locally implemented NPIs,

69

they tend to overlook the inland spread (migration) of the virus in order to provide a unified

70

mitigation strategy that complements local implementations.

71

In this study, we show a strong association between the temporal and geographical spread of the

72

virus. By using a case study of seven states [New York (NY), New Jersey (NJ), Connecticut

73

(CT), Massachusetts (MA), Pennsylvania (PA), Maryland (MD) and Virginia(VA)], we utilize

74

the concepts of ingrowing, incoming and outgoing viral connectivity between states and regions

75

as factors that influence the spread and viral transmission. We then use regression and random

76

walk models to show the importance of these concepts combined with epidemiological and

77

demographic factors -such as transmission rates and Urbanization Index in providing more

78

informative predictions and explaining the temporal and geographic spread of the pandemic. The

79

significance of modeling the spread of the viral wave through geographical routes and regional

80

connectivity reveals broader implications and opportunities for the consideration of more

81

efficient mitigation strategies in blocking viral migration with additional selective interventions.

82
83

Initial Distance From Hotspots Determines Outbreak Severity

84

Using the numbers of ‘deaths per 1 million population’ as a proxy for regional outbreak severity,

85

first we aimed to assess the association between distance from initial viral hotspots and the

86

severity of the viral outbreak. To assign a geographic location for each state, we used the

87

longitude and latitude from its respective larger city. Then, we considered the distance from New

88

York City (New York), Seattle (Washington) and New Orleans (Louisiana) as the three initial

89

hotspots of the outbreak. Introducing New York City (NYC) as a single initial hotspot, showed a

90

high negative correlation (r=-0.37) between the severity of the outbreak and the distance from

91

hotspot. By including Seattle (or San Francisco) as a second hotspot, the association increased

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250785; this version posted February 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

92

(r=-0.43). Finally, by fitting a logarithmic curve, the association increased further to R2=0.35

93

(figure 1). The inclusion of New Orleans as a third hotspot did not improve our results,

94

indicating an isolated outbreak. On the contrary, by removing Louisiana as an outlier, we

95

improved the predictability of the logarithmic curve to R2=0.4. These results suggest a very high

96

association between the outbreak’s severity during the first wave and the distance from the two

97

initial hotspots.

98

By fitting a log curve for the case study of seven states (NY, CT, MA, NJ, PA, MD and VA), we

99

were able to associate the distance from NYC and the severity of the initial spread by explaining

100

70% of the variance. Additional factors strongly linked to the spread and severity of the epidemic

101

include Urbanization Index and maximum effective reproduction rate Rt per state during the first

102

wave, as retrieved from “https://rt.live/us/” (figure 1).

103
104

Major 7-state Outbreak is Related to Few European Lineages

105

To create a dataset of world reference sequences, on June 25th, we sampled 50 sequences

106

spanning the 5 Covid-19 lineages as determined by Nextstrain (Figure 2i). Lineages 19A and

107

19B represent the earliest detected infections closely associated with the Wuhan epidemic. Using

108

the GISAID database, we downloaded all available sequences for our 7 states case study until the

109

6th of August 2020. These sequences represent the first viral wave in the USA. Then, we inferred

110

a phylogenetic tree for each individual state using Bayesian inference with date constraints under

111

a Yule process population model. For all states, the major outbreak clusters with a specific

112

European lineage (reference sequence: HF1465 FRA). For New York, Connecticut and

113

Massachusetts this lineage clearly constitutes the dominant outbreak. For New Jersey,

114

Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, a secondary outbreak -which also circulates in NY, CT

115

and MA- appears significant (figure 2, S1-7).

116
117

Assessing Viral Connectivity Between States

118

By selecting a set of (whenever possible) 50 reference sequences per state (in addition to the set

119

of world reference sequences), we built a phylogenetic tree that includes sequences from all 7

120

states. We then inferred a connectivity map between the different states by parsing the tree’s

121

bipartitions (figure 3i). For this, we examined all possible connected pairs of sequences that

122

cluster together, while moving hierarchically from smaller to larger bipartitions without double-

123

counting. To establish directionality between pairs, we used sampling dates. For example, the

124

pair (NY-PV09151_USA_NY_2020-03-22, CT-UW-6574_USA_CT_2020-04-03) would be

125

counted as NY -> CT, which denotes one incoming transitional connectivity from NY to CT.

126

Similarly, the pair (NY-PV08434_USA_NY_2020-03-18, NY-NYUMC659_USA_NY_2020-

127

03-18) would be counted as ingrown connectivity NY -> NY. Overall, the NY outbreak showed

128

the highest connectivity, while VA and MA showed the lowest. Interestingly, even though CT

129

showed high connectivity comparable to NJ, the decreased number of outgoing versus incoming

130

connections explains the low connectivity shown by MA. This is also supported by the

131

outbreak’s high transitional connectivity from NY to CT (NY ->CT) rendering CT as a potential

132

bottleneck (figure 3).

133
134

Urbanism and Transitional Connectivity Increase Outbreak’s Severity

135

Previously, by considering the geographic distance from the initial hotspots NY and WA, we

136

found a strong association between the distance and the severity of the outbreak for the first

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.30.21250785; this version posted February 2, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

137

month of the epidemic. Additional factors associated with the spread included urbanism, the

138

maximum Rt per state, as well as the neighboring states’ maximum Rt. Here, we test the

139

importance of various features in predicting the per-state death rate across the first wave of the

140

pandemic (March to August 2020). We include in our analysis features including the estimated

141

incoming, outgoing and ingrowing transmission rates between states, and a transmission-based

142

normalized distance of each state from New York representing the viral flow (described below).

143

The full feature set includes: maximum Reproduction rate per state (Rt) usually in April,

144

Urbanization Index (U), Geographic or transition-based distance from New York (D or trD), and

145

incoming, outgoing and ingrowing transmission rates. To determine the importance of regional

146

transitional connectivity in addition to these factors in explaining and predicting the outbreak

147

intensity during the whole first wave, we built 4 regression models with increasing complexity

148

that combine phylogenetic information with epidemiological data from 10 dates (April 29 th, May

149

1st 8th and 15th, June 11th 18th 25th, July 2nd, 29th, August 23rd).

150

In our simplest model (figure 4i) we examined the role of urbanism, distance (D) from NYC and

151

virus’ maximum reproduction rate Rt . U and D showed high and increasing significance

152

throughout the whole first wave, while the use of maximum Rt -as obtained by

153

‘https://rt.live/us/’- showed maximum significance at the beginning of the outbreak but

154

eventually decreased. This is possibly because max Rt only represents the virus’ reproductive

155

rate during the first stage of the outbreak (i.e in March-April), before the lockdowns. In our

156

second model (figure 4ii), we substituted D with Transitional Distance (trD), a weighted version

157

of distance as a proxy for viral flow which considers transitional connectivity between states

158

(e.g. NY -> CT, NY -> NY, CT -> NY, NY -> NJ, .. etc ) using random walks between the states

159

(see methods). By replacing D with trD we were able to significantly increase our model’s

160

predictability throughout the first wave (p=0.0003, figure S8). In our third model (figure 4iii), we

161

returned to using the geographic distance D, but this time we also included each states’ total

162

incoming, outgoing and ingrowing rates. Finally, in our 4th model (figure 4iv), we again replaced

163

D with trD, while also including states’ incoming and outgoing rates. While our 4 th model also

164

integrates transitional connectivity in trD, this information is also used in calculating each state’s

165

incoming, outgoing and ingrowing connectivity. Therefore, as expected, factors trD, incoming

166

and outgoing rates often behave in a complementary manner. However, model 4 is still

167

significantly more informative than model 3 (p=0.0273). Moreover, model 4 indicates that the

168

initial importance of trD during the beginning of the outbreak, is gradually replaced by the state’s

169

connectivity rate, as the outbreak spreads away from the initial hotspots.

170
171

A Case Study for Selective Mitigation Strategies Based on Regional Connectivity

172

Using our second regression model with normalized transitional distance trD, we predicted the

173

total number of deaths by removing one by one each geographic connection between every

174

geographically linked state pair according to figure 3iv. Our results suggested that by enforcing a

175

blockade between New York and Pennsylvania, as well as between Maryland and Pennsylvania

176

would result in saving around 450 and 200 deaths per million individuals respectively, after the

177

lockdowns. This is a particularly interesting result, since our model seems to take into account

178

the drop in deaths in specific states after the imposed lockdowns (based on epidemiological data

179

from NJ, NY, MA and CT) and respond to the temporal flow of the pandemic resulting in later

180

death peaks in states like Virginia (figure S9). This becomes more evident in figure 4vi, where

181

we depict the temporal effect of each blockade in reducing the number of total deaths per million

182

individuals.

184

New York’s Second Wave

185

To understand the origin of New York’s second wave, we inferred a new phylogenetic tree, this

186

time by including all sequences from GISAID after August 2020 and until November 24th

187

(figure 5). In addition to these new sequences, we also included our set of 50 world reference

188

sequences and 50 from NY as mentioned previously. Our results indicate that about half of the

189

second NY outbreak, has been re-introduced from Europe, possibly from Great Britain. This

190

appears to be a completely new lineage, previously unseen in New York.

191
192

METHODS

193

Data Availability

194

All data are available in public databases. SARS-CoV2 genomes were retrieved from the

195

GISAID database 2. Epidemiological data concerning the daily and total deaths per million

196

individuals have been retrieved from Worldometer ‘worldometers.info/coronavirus/’. Maximum

197

reproduction rates have been retrieved from The Covid Tracking Project

198

“https://covidtracking.com/” and ‘https://rt.live/us/’ 29. For the first wave of Covid-19 outbreak in

199

United States we collected a total of 3,133 sequences for the states of New York (NY),

200

Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts (MA), New Jersey (NJ), Pennsylvania (PA), Maryland (MD)

201

and Virginia (VA) that were sampled between 01/29/2020 and 07/05/2020. More specifically, we

202

collected 1505, 353, 418, 45, 112, 178, 522 sequences from each state, respectively. For the

203

second wave of Covid-19 in New York, we collected a total of 112 sequences sampled between

204

08/01/2020 to 10/18/2020.

205

World reference sequences: For the use of reference sequences representing the global pandemic,

206

we randomly selected 50 sequences spanning Nextstrain lineages 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C

207

(see figure 2i).

208

State reference sequences: We randomly selected up to 50 reference sequences from each state,

209

prioritizing selection of one sequence per bipartition with higher than 50% posterior probability.

210

Excluding world reference sequences, 50 sequences were selected from NY, CT, MA and VA

211

while 43, 37, 22 were selected from NJ, PA and MD, respectively.

212
213

Phylogenetic Analysis

214

By retrieving the genomic sequences from GISAID (Supplementary table), we used MAFFT

215

(45) to build multiple sequence alignments for every state based on nucleotide sequence data.

216

Then, using BEAST (31, 32), we performed Bayesian phylogenetic analysis with time

217

constraints based on sampling dates, under a GTR evolutionary model. To determine the

218

appropriate growth models and population size, we tested various growth models including a i)

219

Yule process, ii) exponential growth, iii) logistic growth iv) Bayesian Skyline v) Birth–Death

220

skyline. The BEAST suite also includes multiple software tools that aid in selecting appropriate

221

models and parameters (BEAUti) to infer a phylogenetic tree using Bayesian inference,

222

coalescent theory and speciation with respect to the time of sequence collection. We evaluated

223

the efficacy of these models using Tracer v1.7.1(46). The best model (Yule process) for this data

224

was selected based on the estimated sample size, posterior probabilities, and reports on algorithm

225

convergence.

Estimating Transitional Connectivity

228

Using custom scripts, we were able to parse the inferred phylogenetic trees into groups of

229

sequences based on the tree bipartitions. Then, by further parsing the groups in ascending order

230

based on group size (from groups of 2 to X=10), we determined all possible pairs and state

231

connectivity based on dates. For example, pair of sequences {NY-PV09151_USA_NY_2020-03-

232

22 and CT-UW-6574_USA_CT_2020-04-03} would depict an outgoing connectivity between

233

New York (NY) and Connecticut (CT) denoted as NY>CT +1 (see figure 3i). In the manuscript

234

we show results for a strict/conservative approach where pair inconsistencies are dropped, and

235

sequences cannot be considered as incoming twice.

236
237

Maximum Reproduction Rate Rt

238

To calculate the maximum reproduction rate Rt, we used the maximum Rt value for each state

239

from ‘https://rt.live/us/’ during the first wave of the pandemic (until August 2020). Rt represents

240

the effective reproduction rate of the virus calculated for each locale. It allows to estimate how

241

many secondary infections are likely to occur from a single infection in a specific area.

Regression Analysis Models

252

We perform multiple linear regression analyses in order to assess the importance of each factor

253

on the prediction of the per-state death rate. We use data from 7 states (NY, CT, MA, PA, NJ,

254

VA, MD), over a series of 10 timepoints from April 29 to July 23. We regress the per-state death

255

rate (the cumulative ratio of deaths to cases from the earliest date) on either three variables

256

(Transmission rate (R0), Urbanism, Distance from NYC) or six variables (Transmission rate

257

(R0), Urbanism, Distance from NYC, ingoing/outgoing/ingrowing rates per-state). Prior to the

258

analysis, we Z-score all variables (enforcing zero mean and unit covariance). For distance from

259

NYC, we use either the geographic distance between the state’s capital and NYC, or the

260

transition distance as defined below. For each model, we calculate the log-likelihood by fitting a

261

variance parameter to the predicted outputs and using a Gaussian noise model. Hence, we set

262

𝜎𝑡 2 = (1/𝑁)𝛴𝑖=1:𝑁 (𝑦𝑖𝑡 − 𝛽𝒕 𝒙𝒊𝒕 )2, where 𝑁is the number of states, 𝛽𝑡 and 𝑥𝑖𝑡 are the vectors of

263

coefficients and features associated with state i at time t respectively, and 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is the associated

264

death rate. We calculate the log-likelihood at time t as 𝐿𝑡 = 𝛴𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐺𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑠(𝑦𝑖𝑡 − 𝛽𝒕 𝒙𝒊𝒕 ; 𝟎, 𝝈𝒕 )),

265

where Gauss is the probability density function of a normal distribution. We then compare the

266

log-likelihood differences of pairs of models over time using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient

267

(differences versus temporal ordering).

268
269

Random Walk Model

270

We define the transmission distance of a state from NYC as the expected first arrival time at that

271

state of a Markov random walk starting at NYC, using the transition probabilities between states

estimate these distances, we run 1000 such random walks for 1000 time-steps and use the

276

empirical mean time of first arrival at each state across samples. As above, we Z-score the

277

resulting distances for each state.

Mitigation Analysis

280

In order to break the link between geographically adjacent states 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 , we set a reduction

281

factor 𝑟 = 0.1, and update the transmission probabilities as: 𝑃′ (𝑠𝑏 |𝑠𝑎 ) = 𝑟 ⋅ 𝑃(𝑠𝑏 |𝑠𝑎 ), and

282

𝑃′ (𝑠𝑎 |𝑠𝑎 ) = 𝑃(𝑠𝑎 |𝑠𝑎 ) + (1 − 𝑟) ⋅ 𝑃(𝑠𝑏 |𝑠𝑎 ), where 𝑃′ (𝑠𝑎 |𝑠𝑏 ) is the updated transition

283

probability between states 𝑠𝑎 and 𝑠𝑏 . We make such updates for 𝑎 = 1, 𝑏 = 2 and 𝑎 = 2, 𝑏 = 1

284

simultaneously, hence breaking the link in both directions. We then recalculate the distances

285

𝑑𝑖𝑗1 2 , i.e. the distance between states i and j, given the link between 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 has been broken.

286

We then use these to estimate the overall predicted reduction in the death-rate given the break as:

287

Δ𝑠1𝑠2 = ∑𝑖𝑡 𝑤𝑖 ⋅ (𝑦𝑖𝑡′ − 𝑦𝑖𝑡 ), where 𝑤𝑖 is a weighting factor proportional to the population of state

288

𝑖 (and ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 = 1), and 𝑦𝑖𝑡′ is the predicted death-rate for state i at time t when 𝑑𝑖𝑗1

289

for 𝑑𝑖𝑗 in the predictive model from the Regression analysis.

DISCUSSION

292

Previous studies have provided an important historic view of travel history 8,9,11–14,30 and viral

293

spread of Covid-196,11,12,15 using genetic variability. Others, data driven, have modeled the

294

spread of the virus and effectiveness of government interventions 20,27,28. So far, the only

295

acclaimed and efficient non-pharmaceutical interventions in our arsenal are forms of regional

296

lockdowns 19,22,26,31,32, while other strategies relying on ‘herd immunity’ have also been

297

suggested and disputed 23–25.

298

Here, we used SARS-CoV2 genomes to determine regional connectivity in a case study of 7

299

states, where New York acted as an initial hotspot. By combining epidemiological demographic

300

and genetic information, we used four regression models to evaluate the importance of different

301

factors that contribute to outbreak severity throughout the first viral wave.

302

Our results can explain the discordance between regions and strategies, especially between the

303

first and second pandemic waves. For example, states within distance from hotspots are able to

304

deal with a milder initial outbreak, before the virus establishes at a later timepoint, depending on

305

transitional distance (i.e., the speed of the wave) and regional connectivity. Similarly, states with

306

lower connectivity (e.g., naturally or physically isolated regions) can be more efficient in battling

307

the viral spread, as they deal with reduced viral wave and incoming infections. This also suggests

308

that reducing incoming transmission routes (through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical

309

interventions) can have a significant effect in addition to local mitigation strategies such as

310

lockdowns. This does not necessarily mean complete isolation, but rather a blockade on

311

transmission routes with high connectivity. However, our results also suggest that states deciding

312

to follow less stringent mitigation strategies are also largely responsible for their outgoing viral

313

connectivity, affecting neighboring regions, while often taking advantage of the low incoming

314

connectivity resulting from neighboring lockdowns in return.

315

By deriving genetic connectivity between regions using genomic information, we combined

316

genetic information with demographic and epidemiological data to create a model and a proxy

317

for the flow of the viral wave in order to study factors that temporally contribute to the severity

318

of local outbreaks throughout the pandemic. Then we used this model to consider the outcome of

319

selective intervention strategies using geographic blockades. Overall, our results suggest that

320

unified mitigation strategies are more efficient in tackling a pandemic, while also providing a

321

framework within which to pursue these strategies. Our framework can be implemented for both

322

pharmaceutical (e.g vaccination) or non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., lockdowns,

blockades).

Figure 2. According to a Nextstrain adaptation, there were five main initial lineages of the

360

pandemic (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, 20C), which can be used to suggest the original routes of the

361

transmission in the United States. In 2i) we show the topology of world reference sequences as

362

collected spanning the Nextstrain tree on June 25th. From these randomly collected sequences,

363

sample HF1465 FRA is the only sequence that consistently clusters with each state’s major

364

outbreak (blue line). Two other reference sequences (from Italy and Germany) cluster -again

365

consistently- with each state’s minor outbreak (black dotted line), suggesting that most of the

366

outbreak derives from these specific lineages. In (2ii) we show the unrooted tree of the New

367

York outbreak, which we consider as the outbreak epicenter. In (2iii-vi) we show the

368

phylogenetic tree analysis for Massachusetts, New Jersey, Virginia and Connecticut as rooted by

369

the older lineage that contains sequences from Wuhan dating in 2019.
