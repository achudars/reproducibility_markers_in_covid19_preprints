Abstract
Purpose
Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential causal factor in COVID-19 risk. We aimed to
establish whether blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was associated with
COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank
participants.
Methods
UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37-73 years between 2006 and 2010.
Baseline exposure data, including 25(OH)D concentration, were linked to COVID-19
mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were
performed for the association between 25(OH)D and COVID-19 death, and poisson
regression analyses for the association between 25(OH)D and severe COVID-19 infection.
Results
Complete data were available for 341,484 UK Biobank participants, of which 656 had
inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection and 203 died of COVID-19 infection. Vitamin D was
associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably (mortality HR=0.99;
95% CI 0.98-0.998; p=0.016), but not after adjustment for confounders (mortality HR=0.998;
95% CI=0.99-1.01; p=0.696).
Conclusions
Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of
severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation
to lessen COVID-19 risks may provide false reassurance.

In the hunt for modifiable COVID-19 risk factors, vitamin D has gained a lot of attention both
in the media and within the scientific community.1 Proponents of such a link cite a few early
studies that present circumstantial evidence. They are either ecological, at an individual
level but unable to fully adjust for potential confounders, or they measured vitamin D once
patients were already hospitalised with COVID-19 which introduces reverse causation, as
vitamin D is a negative acute phase reactant.2
Despite the sparse evidence on vitamin D in COVID-19,3 the UK government is now leading
an urgent review into whether there is any link,4 and the Welsh COVID-19 risk assessment
tool already includes vitamin D supplementation as part of its recommendations. 5
We previously observed no evidence of an association between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D) concentration and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital in UK Biobank once
potential confounders were adjusted for.6 Importantly, some of the variables that were
associated with increased COVID-19 risk in our sample, for example lower socioeconomic
status, being Black or South Asian, or being overweight or obese, are also associated with
lower vitamin D. This suggests that the positive findings of other studies may in part be due
to inadequate adjustment. Another recent study of UK Biobank data replicated this finding, 7
but it would be more informative to relate 25(OH)D concentration to COVID-19-related
mortality.
In the current analysis, we therefore linked baseline 25(OH)D concentration in 341,484 UK
Biobank participants with complete data on covariates to Death Register data. In the
sample, 203 participants died due to COVID-19 infection. We explored whether vitamin D as
a continuous measurement, or vitamin D deficiency (defined as <25 nmol/L), or vitamin D
insufficiency (defined as <50 nmol/L), were associated with risk of COVID-19 death using Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. Multivariate models were adjusted for all
measured confounders as detailed in the table legend.
The results followed the same pattern that we observed for COVID-19 infection (Table).6
Lower vitamin D concentration and vitamin D deficiency were both associated with higher
risk of COVID-19 death univariably, but not after adjustment for potential confounders.
Vitamin D insufficiency was not associated with risk of COVID-19 death univariably or
multivariably. Furthermore, we repeated our previous analysis of the association between
vitamin D and confirmed COVID-19 infection, using univariable and multivariable poisson
regression of inpatient diagnosed infection. There were 656 confirmed inpatient COVID-19
cases. Again, vitamin D concentration and vitamin D deficiency were associated with
COVID-19 infection univariably but not multivariably (Table).
The variables significantly associated with risk of COVID-19 mortality in multivariate analysis
were age (HR=1.12; 95% CI 1.10-1.15; p<0.001 per year), male sex (HR=2.12; 95% CI 1.562.89; p<0.001), black ethnicity (HR=8.13; 95% CI 4.56-14.50; p<0.001), obesity (HR=1.68;
95% CI 1.11-2.56; p=0.015 compared with normal weight), socioeconomic deprivation
(highest Townsend deprivation quintile compared with lowest HR=1.96; 95% CI 1.24-3.09;
p=0.004), and diabetes (HR=1.96; 95% CI 1.34-2.86; p=0.001). These findings are consistent
with other studies, lending strong external validity.

The main limitation of using UK Biobank for this analysis is the ~10 year time period
between baseline vitamin D measurement and COVID-19 infection. We examined
concordance rates of vitamin D deficiency in a subsample of 15,473 participants who had
measurements taken both at baseline and at a follow-up visit (on average 4.3 years later).
Concordance in this group was 84%.
If there is a causal link, vitamin D supplements would present an appealingly cheap low risk
intervention. However, currently there is no evidence that supplements will reduce risk of
COVID-19 infection. NHS guidelines already recommend that all UK residents take vitamin D
supplements in the winter, and furthermore that certain groups who are more likely to be
deficient (for example those with darker skin) take them throughout the year.8 We await the
results of randomised controlled trials to determine whether there should be any change to
these guidelines and consequently clinical practice. For now, recommendations for vitamin
D supplementation to lessen COVID-19 risks may cause little harm but could provide false
reassurance.
