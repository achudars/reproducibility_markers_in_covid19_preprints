Deficient hand washing facilities in public toilets in the time of the COVID-19
pandemic: A survey in one high-income country

ABSTRACT
Aims: To identify the extent of the provision of water and soap for hand washing in public
toilets at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To also make comparisons with a pre-pandemic
survey that included a sample of the same facilities.
Methods: We collected data from 400 toilets that were open to the public; all those in three
contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around the rest
of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a
2012/2013 survey.
Results: For all the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for hand washing and 14.8% had no
soap. There was COVID-19 related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of
the COVID-19 QR code used to facilitate contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic hand washing
signage in 1.8%. The hand washing water had “no touch” activation at 28.0% of toilets and at
18.5% for toilet bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets
had damage which would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). For the 128 sites
that had also been examined in the previous survey, this new survey found significantly
increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision
of water.
Conclusions: Despite the serious threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of hand
washing facilities in public toilets sampled required tap touching, and did not have health
messaging. Nevertheless there has been some modest improvements in soap (but not water)
provision since the previous survey eight years before.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has focused international attention on non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPI) to reduce pandemic spread prior to vaccination roll-out. Such NPIs include
hygiene practices such as appropriate hand washing, which is an evidence-based measure for
preventing respiratory virus transmission.1
More specifically, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance on COVID-19
and hygiene/sanitation.2 This guidance highlights the importance of hand washing facilities (with
water and soap) and of having separate toilets “for people with suspected or confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection.” Also “the toilet should be flushed with the lid down to prevent droplet splatter
and aerosol clouds.” The latter recommendation is supported by data from a COVID-19
quarantine room study which found that “the inner walls of toilet bowl and sewer inlet were the

most contaminated sites with the highest viral loads.”3 Another such study reported that “there
was extensive environmental contamination by 1 SARS-CoV-2 patient” with toilet bowl and sink
samples being positive for viral RNA.4 There has also been one study indicating circumstantial
evidence of fecal aerosol transmission of COVID-19 via an apartment drainage system,5 similar
to an outbreak from fecal aerosols of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003.6
While improving hygiene in a pandemic is highly desirable, it is also beneficially for reducing
the spread of other respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza and norovirus infection. For
example, one review identified six studies that implicated bathroom surfaces as primary sources
of human norovirus infection.7
In our case study country, New Zealand, there was community spread of the pandemic virus
(SARS-CoV-2) on a number of occasions during the 2020 year, but elimination was successfully
achieved and re-achieved after a series of border control failures.8 9 This success arose largely
from a combination of tight border controls (quarantine and isolation), a strict lockdown and
widespread testing/contact tracing. Actions related to hygiene included:
• Mass media messages relating to hand washing, cough etiquette, staying home when sick,
and mask use.
• Actions by organisations to install hand sanitisers and posters with hygiene messaging in
workplaces and various public places.
• Public toilets were all closed at the highest lockdown level.
• Actions by some local government agencies to increase soap availability in the public
toilets they maintain (eg, by Napier City Council10) and to include posters with hygiene
messaging in these facilities.
Given the latter point, the aim of this study was to identify the provision of water and soap for
hand washing (along with related health messaging) in New Zealand public toilets at the time of
the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to make comparisons with a pre-pandemic survey11
that included a sample of the same facilities.
By way of context, New Zealand is a high-income country, but one where there has been
reported shortages of public toilets, especially in areas with high numbers of international
tourists.12 13 Previous research has also shown deficiencies with public toilets in the country, in
terms of lacking hand washing water (4%) and lacking soap (39%).11 14 Another study of toilets
in one New Zealand city (mainly at cafés and public facilities), found that some had no
handwashing facilities (2%) and no soap (13%).15 Within this sample, the lack of soap was
highest in the public toilets at 38%. Another New Zealand study of primary school toilets also
reported that only 28% had facilities meeting the relevant code of practice ie, there was a lack of
hot water, lack of drying facilities and lack of soap.16 Inadequate hand hygiene has also been
recorded, with public toilet users in New Zealand sometimes not washing hands (13%) or using
soap (28%).17

METHODS
Survey sampling: The sample frame was comprehensive for the public toilets in three
contiguous cities with a combined population of 389,000, with additional convenience sampling
in cities and rural areas, based on author travel plans for other reasons around New Zealand from
18 July 2020 to 2 January 2021. We expanded the sample to a total of 400 toilets, which we
estimated would be at least 10% of the facilities nationwide. But we also aimed to replicate a
previous survey of facilities in public toilets in the lower North Island in 2012/2013.11 The public
toilets were located by:
• Online city council maps of public toilets were used for the comprehensive three council
area survey.18-20 However, data could not be collected on a minority of these (<5%) due
to closure for repairs and/or being padlocked shut, suggestive that they were only opened
for specific sporting events.
• Using ‘Google Maps’ to locate a ‘city/town/district’, and then in the map searching for
‘public toilets’.
• Using the smartphone app version of ‘CamperMate’.21
• Roadside public toilet signs when travelling by car.
We excluded from the sample, public toilets that were not directly open to the outside (ie, which
were inside of other buildings such as within shopping complexes; council-owned facilities such
as libraries; and within railway or ferry buildings, some of which were signed as for “patrons
only”). Where facilities were closed or were being cleaned, we attempted repeat visits where this
was convenient.
Data collection: At each toilet facility, we surveyed all the men’s and unisex toilets. Toilet
facilities contained from one to six self-contained “toilet units” with a separate door that opened
to the outside – albeit some units of “men’s toilets” would include multiple hand washing basins,
a urinal and multiple toilet bowls. Data were collected on the availability of water and soap for
handwashing. Toilets with empty soap containers were counted as without soap. We also
photographed all health-related signage (eg, relating to COVID-19 and handwashing).
Requirements for touching (or not) of taps/buttons/levers for activating tap water and flushing
the toilet were noted. The presence of lids for toilet bowls was documented, given concerns
around potential virus dispersion when flushing when the lid is not down (see Introduction).
Analysis: We compared results for the three city council comprehensive sample with the
supplementary convenience sample. Comparisons were also made with the exact same facilities
involved in the previous survey conducted in 2012/2013 (albeit excluding 14.7% (22/150) which
were not readily accessible or which had subsequently been closed down). Statistical analysis
used OpenEpi (v 3.01) and Mid-P exact values were calculated (2-tailed).
National denominator estimation: To provide context for our survey, we estimated the total
number of such public toilet facilities in New Zealand using the following steps:
• For city-based local authorities we used as a basis the facilities we surveyed in the three
city comprehensive sample (n=131 or 3.4 per 10,000 population).
• For the other local authorities we used data from Google Maps in three LAs in the
Wairarapa region (n=13 facilities) and scaled from our estimate of the sensitivity of such

•

data on Google Maps from the three city council survey (at 61.8% or 81/131 giving a
scaling factor of 1.62). This gave 21 facilities or 4.3 per 10,000 population.
We then extrapolated the three city council results to the other 12 LAs in New Zealand
which were city ones; and the Wairarapa results to the other 51 LAs which were council
districts.

RESULTS
Survey results for 2020/21: Our survey comprised 400 toilet units at 242 toilet facilities. We
estimated that nationwide the total number of such toilet facilities was around 985 in city
councils and around 760 in district councils, ie, around 1864 in the whole country (3.7 per
10,000 population). So our sample was estimated at 13.0% of the estimated total (242/1864),
which was greater than our target of a 10% sample.
Most of the sample of 400 toilet units were from the comprehensive survey of three contiguous
city councils (n = 228), relative to the additional convenience sample (n = 172). The former
grouping was all in the lower North Island, were more likely to be unisex (vs men’s toilets), and
involved more toilets in cities (but fewer in towns and rural areas) (Table 1).
The proportion of all the 400 toilets without water for hand washing was 2.5%, with this being
higher in the convenience sample than the three urban councils sample (5.2% vs 0.4%; risk ratio
(RR) = 11.9; 95%CI = 1.53 to 93.3; p = 0.0030). Absence of soap was 14.8% overall, and this
was also higher in the convenience sample vs the three councils sample (21.5% vs 9.6%; RR =
2.23; 95%CI = 1.37 to 3.64; p = 0.0011). Most soap was dispensed as a liquid or foam (Figure
S1-3), but at 6.0% of toilets it was available in a cake/bar form. A number of toilets had
containers for liquid soap, but they were empty (Table 1).
In terms of “no touch” activation, this was available for hand washing water at 28.0%, for toilet
bowl flushing at 18.5%, and for urinal flushing at 80.5%. Toilet bowl lids were not present for
32.8% (many were designed or built this way) (Figure S3-1), and 2.3% of toilets had damage
which would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats, Figure S3-1; broken toilet rolls,
Figure S3-2; and destroyed liquid soap dispensers, Figure S3-3).
The majority of toilets had no health related-signage (72.8%). Some form of COVID-19 related
health messaging was the most common type (19.5%), followed by the COVID-19 QR code used
to facilitate contact tracing via an official smartphone app (12.3%), generic hand washing
signage (1.8%) and then non-smoking signage (1.3%), (see Supplementary File 2 for examples
of these posters). COVID-19 health messaging signage was more common in the convenience
sample than in the three urban council sample (RR = 1.81; 95%CI = 1.21 to 2.71; p = 0.0040).
There was no signage that promoted toilet lid lowering prior to flushing.
From a qualitative perspective, we noted that several COVID-19 signs in tourist areas were in
Chinese language (Figure S2-1) and a few hand washing signs included te reo Māori wording
(language of Indigenous New Zealanders) (Figure S2-3). We also noted that some automatic

little water for a satisfactory hand wash (ie, repeat activation was required).

DISCUSSION
Main findings
This survey found a deficient provision of soap (14.8% of toilet units with none), and to a lesser
extent water (2.5% with none). These findings suggest that while there has been some
statistically significant improvement in soap provision (but not water provision) in the eight year
period since the previous survey, the attempts by some local government agencies to increase
soap provision at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic10 needs to be further augmented.
The higher water (5.2% vs 0.4%) and soap provision (21.5% vs 9.6%) in the comprehensive
three urban council sample vs the convenience sample respectively, is likely to reflect the more
modern facilities in the former and/or a higher quality maintenance schedule. As New Zealand is
highly urbanised, we suspect that the true nationwide results would be closer to those of the three
council survey than the convenience sample ones.
The relatively low level of health related signage was a problematic finding, especially the
COVID-19 related health messaging (at 19.5%), the COVID-19 QR code (12.3%), and generic
hand washing signage (1.8%). These deficits are likely to represent both long-term lack of
signage relating to hand washing, as well as an inadequate response to the COVID-19 threat.
Also of note from a hygiene perspective was the limited extent of “no touch” activation of
devices (ie, for hand washing water at 28.0% and for toilet bowl flushing at 18.5%). These
should ideally be expanded with the potential long-term goal being to have maximally “no
touch” facilities (including automated: door opening and locking via hand waving in front of a
sensor, water dispensing, soap dispensing, toilet flushing and hand drier activation). Automation
could extend to the toilet bowl lid being closed before flushing.

Ensuring that all toilet bowls have lids (missing for 32.8% in this survey – often by design) is
also desirable, along with messaging to close the lids prior to flushing (see Introduction for the
rationale for lid closing).
Study strengths and limitations
This is the largest such survey to date in New Zealand that we know of, and it was able to
compare a sub-sample of the same facilities after an eight year period. It was also conducted at a
time where there was greatly heightened need for hygiene due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nevertheless, the study was limited by only being comprehensive in three contiguous council
areas, with the rest being convenience sampling. This was owing to this being an unfunded study
with no budget for travel. The convenience sampling is likely to have involved surveying
facilities that were more accessible to the researchers by being on main roads. These may be
relatively newer and have a better maintenance schedule than facilities in small rural towns. This
may have resulted in some under-estimation from the convenience sample of the extent of the
problems outside urban areas (eg, with water and soap availability).
Potential research and policy implications
A fundamental research issue is to better quantify the risks of infectious disease transmission
associated with use of public toilets (eg, from any aerosolisation of faeces and from touching
contaminated surfaces). This is not only relevant to SARS-CoV-2, but also other infectious
diseases (eg, norovirus infection and seasonal influenza).
Nevertheless, surveys such as this could be improved upon by making them fully random at the
national level and collecting additional data on the facilities to compare them with local
standards (eg, as per New Zealand ones,22 albeit from 1999) or more state-of-the-art Japanese
designs.23 Research on ways to minimise the vandalism of public toilets is also needed, as this
has been a reported barrier to soap dispensers in New Zealand in the past.10 Art work inside
toilets and on exterior walls is used in some New Zealand toilets (Figure S1-1) and might be
worth expanding if it is found to be effective against vandalism.
Policy goals for local government could be to ensure all facilities have water and soap, and to
move towards designs that are maximally “no touch”. Built-in redundancy (eg, two separate soap
dispensers) may be desirable to minimise the risk of running out of soap, and cakes of soap
should probably be avoided as these are more vulnerable to theft. If fully automated taps are not
installed, then tap levers or floor pedals for activating water flow could be an alternative. Levers
allow users to use the back of their hands and levers can also be more suited than conventional
taps for people with disabilities such as arthritis.
Central government could set and enforce minimum standards for council-owned public toilet
facilities and the extent of their provision. It could also boost funding support for these purposes,
at least partly from border charges collected from international tourists (a funding system already
in place in New Zealand). The extent of the funding needed should be seen in the context of the
huge costs of COVID-19 and future pandemics, and from other respiratory viruses such as
seasonal influenza and from norovirus infection.

Conclusions
To conclude, despite the serious threat and great costs of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while
there has been some improvement in soap provision in the eight year period since the previous
survey, the attempts by some local government agencies to increase such provision need to be
further augmented. There are also other design and maintenance deficiencies that would improve
hygiene in public toilets. There is a major scope for improving health messaging at these sites,
and this might be a low-cost and quick intervention to reduce pandemic spread.
