ABSTRACT
Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new
daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as
efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted
Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release
strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the
entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable.
Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of
new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold.

We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working
11

non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how
to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly
found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak,
then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled
an “on-off” strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the
worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution
against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism.

The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate,
where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We
suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.

Introduction

13

History of SARS-CoV-2 to date

14

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has provoked the global pandemic

15

of COVID-19. First reported in the city of Wuhan, China, its emergence quickly triggered a ‘lockdown’ within Wuhan and the

16

surrounding cities1 , requiring people to remain at home, only leaving for essential journeys. Since then the virus has spread

17

rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare a global pandemic on the 11th of March. Globally, the

18

outbreak has spread to 210 countries and territories, with 3,007,194 confirmed cases, 207,265 deaths and 883,298 recovered

19

individuals, as of the 27th of April. (Viewed on April 27, 2020, 10:42 GMT2, 3 ).

20

21

Containment of the virus has proven challenging. Although some patients will require intensive care, others have unre-

22

ported mild symptoms, with as many as 17.9% of infected individuals possibly being asymptomatic4 . Those with compromised

23

immunities, underlying health conditions, and of old age, are most at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome

24

(ARDS) and subsequent respiratory failure, necessitating the use of mechanical ventilators in a dedicated intensive care unit

25

(ICU)5 . This mass spread of infection, and increasing pressure on hospital capacity has led the UK to follow the example

26

of neighbouring European countries by officially implementing a lockdown as of March 23rd. While this appears to have

27

slowed the spread of infection, the cost to the economy of such measures is considerable, with the first 1.5 months of lockdown

28

estimated to have cost the UK 3.4% of its GDP6 . With a viable vaccine still several months or years away, lockdown measures

29

will eventually need to be lifted, but this must be done without risk of overwhelming the health service. If all restrictions are

30

lifted universally, this could trigger a rapid resurgence of infections and cause further death.

31

32

Here we consider a two-way balance which aims to (i) maximize the number of people able to work outside of lockdown, while

33

(ii) ensuring that the number of people with COVID-19 requiring medical help at no point crosses a threshold beyond which

34

hospitals are unable to cope. As an immediate termination of lockdown for all is likely to trigger a surge in infections, a graded

35

easing of lockdown restrictions is likely required. The focus of our analysis is to understand the optimal pathway by which to

36

release people as safely as possible back into to a general and growing non-quarantined set of workers.

37

Mathematical Modelling

38

To understand how to restart the economy yet avoid the saturation of health services, we present decision-making as a problem

39

in optimal control. To determine an optimal solution requires two definitions. The first is a system of process-based differential

40

equations whose boundary conditions or other attributes can be varied by policy decisions. The second definition is an objective

41

function metric, which depends on the balance and extent to which our two conditions are fulfilled. The aim is to solve the

42

differential equations, and find decisions affecting their boundary conditions that are optimal and maximise the objective

43

function. Our equation set is based on a standard Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered (SEIR) model framework7 . Each

44

of the four components has a modelled population, and as time evolves, people move through each class towards recovery

45

(or death). The novel part of our analysis is that the SEIR equations are solved for two groups (i.e. communities). The

46

first community is a non-quarantined group, and during the full lockdown, this represents the essential workers required to

47

maintain health provision, or essential services. The second community is those in quarantine. The main distinction between

48

the non-quarantine and quarantine groups is that, in the latter, lockdown causes a much lower rate of virus transmission.

49

50

SEIR-based equations are solved for non-quarantine and quarantine groups, connected by modelled release strategies from

51

lockdown. That is, we allow different fractions of the quarantined group to move into the non-quarantined group, and at different

52

times. For each potential strategy of movement between the two groups, an objective function is calculated - some metric

53

describing the desirability of such a strategy. This is high when many people are removed from quarantine, as they are available

54

to work - a desirable outcome. However, its value switches to a near-infinite negative should the health service threshold be

55

crossed due to high infection numbers. Our model calculates the highest possible objective function (the optimal strategy) and

56

returns the number of release dates, their time of occurrence, and the number of people at each time. For comparison, we

57

perform parallel simulations, where we release all in quarantine to the non-quarantine pool, but allow the return to quarantine

58

later if necessary, should infections risk exceeding the capacity of the health services. We herein refer to this as a lockdown

59

“on-off release” strategy, and again find optimal timings and number of releases.

60

61

No mathematical model, especially for something as complicated as virus transmission and human behaviours, can make

62

predictions accurate to within a small margin of error. However, models are especially useful in two circumstances, and that

63

we exploit. First, although simulations may lack absolute precision, predictions will have some level of robustness. Such

64

predictions give strong indications of expected responses to a range of different boundary conditions, i.e. alternative release

65

scenarios. Numerical model flexibility and speed of operation enables “what if?” questions to be asked of alternative forms of

66

graded lockdown release. Second, by repeated operation of a model, it is possible to scan across ranges of parameter values.

67

After governments start to release people, changes to infection levels can be compared against ensembles of simulations with

68

perturbed parameters. Data-model comparison allows selection of the most appropriate parameter value; an approach sometimes

69

referred to as “adaptive learning”. The trajectory for that value becomes a more reliable forecast for the days and weeks

70

beyond the available data. Evidence this approach is feasible is illustrated in data of infections in countries before and during a

71

lockdown. Although there is substantial geographic variation, all curves have similar forms, amenable to parameterisation.

72

Indeed, politicians have frequently described a mathematical functional form, with the expression “flattening the curve”, used

73

to explain why lockdown is essential to avoid overwhelming health services.

74

75

Our aim is to generate dynamical predictions and help inform the debate as to future lockdown release options. Each

76

simulation can be readily understood in terms of policy decisions, and mathematically this implies careful parameterisation.

77

Our model is parameter sparse, yet sufficiently complex to capture a broad range of options. Critically, each parameter is

78

related to understandable quantities characterising infection levels or lockdown decisions. A central part of our analysis, in the

79

absence of much knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is to vary our fundamental parameters to determine their effect on the

80

optimal strategy. This identification of sensitivity aids understanding and can identify research priorities crucial to enhancing

81

our understanding and ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

82

Methods

83

Model Framework

84

Our model considers two parallel SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) systems, one describing the spread of

85

disease in the quarantined ‘lockdown’ population, and the other capturing the spread amongst those at work. Under full

86

lockdown, the latter pool contains only front-line workers who are unable to adopt social-distancing measures. This is captured

87

by the following system of ordinary differential equations:

98

individual is currently under lockdown conditions.

99

100

Our equations describe the movement of individuals through four stages, from being initially susceptible to the disease

101

(S/SQ ), contracting the disease but not yet being infectious (E/EQ ), becoming infectious (I/IQ ), and finally recovering from

102

the disease (R/RQ ), at which point we assume an individual becomes immune to future infections (Fig. 1). The function u(t)

103

describes the release strategy employed, controlling the movement of individuals between the ‘quarantined’ and ‘released’

104

groups.

107

The lowercase Greek letters in equations (1) - (8) represent our rate parameters. Firstly, β represents the transmission rate

108

of the disease. Significant work early in the pandemic used available data to quantify the rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission

109

and a range of estimates have already been reported in the literature. Kucharski et al. (2020)8 calculated an R0 of 1.15-4.77

110

when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in Wuhan. This corresponds in our case to a β ranging from roughly 0.25 - 1.06.

111

Similarly, when fitting to data from the initial outbreak in Italy, Giordano et al. (2020)9 estimated a total transmission rate of

112

1.048, split between the four different infected classes they considered. These data-fit estimations risk failing to capture the

113

impact of asymptomatic or unrecorded individuals, especially for the wider-ranging classes of our model, with a vision towards

114

informing policy. For this reason our sensitivity analyses (below) also consider transmission rates up to twice as high as these

115

values. Note that we consider the population of both I and IQ to impact the spread of disease, as the quarantined group are still

116

assumed to occasionally mix with the population (for instance, when leaving their homes to shop for essential items). The

117

parameter c is a scalar between 0 and 1 that captures how effective the self-isolation (i.e. lockdown) measures enforced are in

118

reducing the the rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

119

120

µ represents the natural, background death rate of the population regardless of the impact of COVID-19, and can have

121

important implications for the strength of herd-immunity effects on disease dynamics, as this is the only mechanism in our

122

model through which the recovered population is reduced. The parameter α represents the rate of death directly attributed to

123

SARS-CoV-2. While the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to vary substantially between age classes10–12 ,

124

in its current form our model does not incorporate age-structure and we therefore adopt an age-invariant mortality rate.

125

126

The parameter σ represents the incubation rate. The exposed population classes, E/EQ , capture the effect of the lag be-

127

tween people becoming infected (and incubating the disease for several days) and becoming infectious. Understanding the size

128

of this effect is of great importance when assessing strategies in which a second lockdown may be enforced because efforts to

129

monitor the subsequent spread of infection must consider the upcoming, but lagged, threat posed by the exposed class. Lastly, γ

130

represents the recovery rate and describes how long individuals remain infectious.

131

132

In the present work, we used the population of the United Kingdom as an example to inform our initial proportion of

133

the population in quarantine. Using Labour Force Survey data from 2018/19, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimate that 7.1

134

million adults across the UK are in the set of key-worker guidelines set out by the UK government13 . We define this 10.42% of

135

the population as not currently being in lockdown, and initiate the model with the remaining population in lockdown. Initial

136

numbers of individuals in each class were calculated using estimates presented by Flaxman et al. (2020)14 , with the assumed

137

values valid as of the 28th of March 2020.

138

139

All model variables, parameters and the values used for these are presented in Table 1. The full set of parameter esti-

140

mates obtained, with links to the original sources, have been collated and made available in Appendix 1 to aid the modelling

141

efforts of other research groups.

142

Model Assumptions

143

Firstly, the extent and longevity of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and its effect on the dynamics of the pandemic, remain open, high

144

priority research questions15, 16 . Recent modelling efforts have, however, thus far shown little difference when incorporating the

145

impact of waning immunity9 . We therefore assume that, once developed, immunity provides complete and indefinite protection

146

against SARS-CoV-2.

147

148

The parsimonious nature of our model was chosen to enhance the ease of interpretation of our results and, most impor-

149

tantly, to enable the model to be quickly adapted to non-UK populations. Different countries currently provide varying levels of

150

epidemiological detail in their reporting of COVID-19 cases. By reducing the number of classes and parameters considered, our

151

model is amenable to a wider range of countries and scenarios than the more specific model structures currently published9, 17 .

152

The result of this modelling choice is that our system captures the broad-scale dynamics of the disease resulting from different

153

lockdown exit-strategies rather than making accurate predictions of the number of infected individuals, which will require

154

continuous, data-driven adaptations applied to our framework.

155

Optimal Control

156

The primary challenge facing policy makers currently is in devising how to return the population to work most safely, ending

157

the lockdown and its detrimental consequences on the economy. The objective is to release as many people from lockdown, as

158

soon as possible, without overwhelming the health system with a subsequent resurgence of infections. This objective neatly fits

159

the general framework of optimal control problems, a branch of mathematical study that seeks to maximise a certain objective

160

functional through the use of available controls, while limited by constraints. In our model, the controls are the methods by

161

which we release people from the quarantined class, described by the function u(t), and our constraint is our infection capacity,

162

the maximum number of people our health system can effectively support at a given time. A solution is optimal if it returns the

163

maximum number of people to work without breaking this constraint.

164

165

We consider two distinct strategies for ending the lockdown; a ‘gradual release’ strategy, whereby individuals are slowly,

166

but permanently, released from quarantine in staggered waves until the entire population has been transferred from the

167

quarantined class, and an ‘on-off release’ strategy, whereby the lockdown is lifted for the entire population simultaneously,

168

but can subsequently be reinstated when necessary (the mathematical formulation of these strategies is outlined below). In

169

each case, we seek to ensure that any strategy employed does not cause the total number of infected individuals (I + IQ )

170

to surpass a certain threshold at any time. This threshold, Ithresh , represents the maximum carrying capacity of the health

171

service that cannot be exceeded. Ferguson et al. (2020) take the surge capacity of ICU beds in the UK to be 14 per 100,000

172

people10 , equating to a total of 9240 ICU beds. They further note that as many as 30% of hospitalisations may require critical

173

care. Combined with their estimate that 4.4% of all infections will require hospitalisations, this provides a range of values

174

for Ithresh to be considered in our sensitivity analysis, centred around an approximate threshold of 4,000,000 infected individuals.

175

176

Many formal optimal control approaches employ the use of “adjoint equations" to minimise the Hamiltonian of the ODE

177

system. While we also pursued this approach, it requires a continuous-time form for the control function u(t), which (i)

178

displayed extreme sensitivity in relation to any chosen objective functional, and (ii) is unlikely to be representative of lockdown

180

results presented in the following section are instead derived from an iterative process in which multiple different release times

and portions of the population are trialled across various ranges, with the optimal choice being that which maximises our

objective function. All code used to perform these optimal control approaches was performed in Matlab, and is available at:

Gradual Release

186

A gradual release strategy aims to end the lockdown of the the public from quarantine through multiple staggered releases.

187

Expressed mathematically, we seek to release M1 people at time T1 , while ensuring that I + IQ < Ithresh at all times. We

188

iterate across a large mesh of potential values for M1 and T1 , and for each trial we calculate the objective functional C1 =

189

M1 − T1 − J(I, IQ ), where J(I, IQ ) is a penalty function that heavily penalises any iteration that results in I(t) + IQ (t) > Ithresh

192

Therefore, the optimum choice of M1 and T1 are those which maximise C1 . In short, this approach calculates how to release as

193

many individuals as possible, as early as possible, without breaking the infection carrying capacity. After this optimum solution

194

is found, a second release of M2 people at time T2 can be similarly calculated after the first release, if people still remain in

195

quarantine.

196

197

To calculate these outputs, we used ode45, a fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver in Matlab, to solve the system of equa-

198

tions (1)-(8) using the initial conditions in Table 1 for t from 0 to T1 . At this point we subtracted M1 individuals proportionally

199

from SQ , EQ , IQ and RQ and added these to S, E, I and R. The system was then solved again from these new points for t from T1

200

to 400 days. To allow understanding of the effect of different values of some of the parameters presented in Table 1, we operate

201

our model for a range of parameter values. Specifically, this was performed for a range of different transmission rates, β ,

202

infection thresholds, Ithresh , and transmission reduction, c. Figure 2 depicts an illustrative example of a gradual release scenario.

On-Off Release

The “on-off" release strategy considers releasing the quarantined population all at once, with the aim to then return everyone to

with the gradual release strategy, we iteratively trial multiple potential values of Tioff and Tion (where Tion > Tioff ).

209

210

For each choice of Tioff and Tion we calculate an objective functional Ci = (Tion − Tioff ) − Tioff − J(I, IQ ), where J(I, IQ ) is

211

as defined above. The optimum choice of Tioff and Tion is the pair that maximises C. In short, we seek the longest possible

212

duration out of quarantine, as soon as possible, without breaking the infection carrying capacity. We plot an example of an

213

on-off release scenario in Figure 3 below.

Figures 2 and 3 are example simulations, to illustrate general model behavior, but are not optimal solutions. We now consider

Gradual Release

219

The number of people to be released from quarantine, M1 , was divided into a mesh of 1000 equally-spaced points ranging

220

from 0 to the total quarantined population, NQ (0). Each one of these trial values for M1 was simulated against a mesh of

221

1000 equally-spaced points ranging from 0 to 400 for an associated release time T1 . Once an optimum solution was found, a

222

second optimum release pair, M2 individuals released at time T2 was also found. Unless specified otherwise, the base values

same as presented in Table 1). The optimum solution was found for a range of values of β , c and Ithresh , to observe how these

225

uncertainties affect the optimum solution. These solutions are presented in Figure 4, where the top row (plots a to c) display the

226

228

229

From Figure 4, we see that varying the infection threshold, Ithresh , or the lockdown effectiveness, c, has the greatest impact on

230

Mi the number of people released, while the time of initial release Ti remains mostly unchanged. This suggests that an increase

231

of 1,000,000 to Ithresh can allow approximately 4,000,000 more people to be released from quarantine. Changes to transmission

232

(β ) instead primarily adjusts the time at which releases are made, with the number of people released remaining relatively

233

consistent. Figure 4b shows that for each trialled transmission value, approximately 50% of the quarantined population can be

234

released once the current infected population reaches a sufficiently low level. In each case, there is approximately a two-week

235

period between when the peak in infected individuals has ended and when individuals are released from quarantine. Figure

236

4c shows that, for less-effective lockdown measures, more individuals are able to be release from quarantine once the initial

237

peak has ended. This seemingly counter-intuitive result is due to the reduced lockdown effectiveness meaning that a greater

238

proportion of the quarantined population have been infected while in quarantine, and have since entered the recovered class.

239

This means they can be re-added to the working pool without substantial risk of further infections. This result however clearly

240

depends on the strength of any acquired immunity.

241

242

Additional to the graphical sensitivity analysis presented in Figure 4, a quantitative sensitivity analysis was also conducted

243

on each model parameter. For each parameter, we calculated the total sensitivity index25 , STi , a variance-based sensitivity

244

metric that shows how ‘important’ a model parameter is in affecting a certain model outcome. In this study, the model

247

outcome considered is the objective function, C, for our optimum strategy. Defined formally, the total sensitivity index for
V (E(Y |X∼i ))
parameter i is STi = 1 −
, where Y is the model outcome monitored, and Xi is the parameter considered. X∼i
V (Y )
here represents fixing all parameters except for parameter i. The total sensitivity index is equal to 1 minus the variance in

248

the expected outcome when all parameters except the one in question are fixed, divided by the variance if no parameters are fixed.

245

246

249

250

In essence, for each model parameter a value between 0 and 1 is calculated that describes how sensitive the optimum

251

release strategy is to that parameter, with a value nearer unity being more sensitive. Total sensitivity indexes were calculated for

252

β , σ , α, γ, c and Ithresh . In descending order, these were estimated through Monte Carlo sampling to be: γ : 0.4978, β : 0.3928,

253

Ithresh : 0.1994, σ : 0.0958, c : 0.0018, α : 0.0006. We therefore find that our optimum release strategy is not strongly dependent

254

on the values of the disease-induced death rate, the lockdown effectiveness, or the incubation rate (α, c, or σ ), and that in

255

monitoring the effectiveness and outcome of a release strategy, the recovery rate and transmission rate of the disease should be

256

most closely studied.

257

On-Off Releases

258

To determine the optimal timings for an “on-off" lockdown release strategy, both the times at which quarantine was ended, Tioff ,

259

and the times at which it was reinstated, Tion , were iterated on a mesh of 500 evenly spaced points across a timespan of 0 to 400.

260

Once one optimum release pair was found, the process was repeated up to two further times to identify subsequent optimum

261

releases as necessary. Unless otherwise stated, the base values used were Ithresh = 4 × 106 , c = 0.05, β = 1.5, µ =

262

σ = 0.1961, α = 0.00657 and γ = 0.2222, which are again the same values listed in Table 1. A lower base value of β was

263

used as it was considered unlikely that the population would be released from quarantine without certain social-distancing

264

policies being implemented. The optimum solution was found for a range of different values of β , c and Ithresh . These solutions

265

are presented in Figure 5.

80·365 ,

266

267

From Figure 5 we see that, in all scenarios, it is never optimal to leave the entire population out of quarantine for long. Notably,

268

we see in every instance that the optimum solution results in quarantine only being lifted for periods of 1-2 weeks. This

269

presents a very narrow window of time to be able to monitor the rise in infections. There was no distinguishable change

270

in dynamic behaviour between the different parameters sampled. We see in Figure 5b that increasing the transmission of

271

the disease required the initial quarantine to be ended later, and for subsequent quarantines to be enforced for a longer

272

duration. All optimum solutions do however result in rapidly increasing herd immunity by moving a large number of individuals

273

to the recovered class. This difference can be seen by noting the difference in timescale on the horizontal axes of Figures 4 and 5.

274

275

Just as with the gradual release strategy, total sensitivity indices were calculated via the same method for our optimum

276

on-off strategy. In descending order, and for the on-off strategy, these now become: γ : 0.6371, Ithresh : 0.3775, β : 0.2973, σ :

277

0.2821, c : 0.0478, α : 0.0045. We see that the order of sensitivity is roughly the same as for the gradual release strategy,

278

however all values (except for β ) show increased sensitivity on the optimal result. The impact of the incubation period is the

279

most substantially different, and this is due to the shorter durations of time people are out of quarantine in the optimum solution,

280

meaning small changes to the incubation period may have large unexpected impacts on the surge in infected individuals.

281

Discussion

282

Here we have investigated the optimal release of individuals from a state of lockdown. The primary conclusion of our work

283

is that a gradual release strategy is far preferable to an on-off release strategy. We conclude this from the finding that a

284

population-wide instantaneous release would cause the number of infected individuals to rise dramatically, in a short period

285

of time. Any decision to begin easing lockdown measures will require constant monitoring and a high-level of population

286

testing to track the likely rise towards a second-peak of infections. We show that employing a gradual release strategy, where

287

groups of the population are slowly released from quarantine sequentially, will slow the arrival of any subsequent infection

288

peaks compared to an on-off strategy, where lockdown is ended for all individuals imminently and reinstated when subsequent

289

infections begin to increase. In all considered instances (i.e. parameter variations), it will not be possible to end lockdown

290

for the entire population for any longer than two weeks, as the number of infected individuals is then expected to quickly

291

overwhelm the health service following such a release. By ensuring that the increase in the number of infected individuals is as

292

slow as possible, this will enable health officials to monitor more accurately the evolving situation, and provide more time to

293

respond to unexpected increases in the number of infected individuals. We note that our approach does not consider the ethical

294

responsibilities that will also impact any policy decision. If enough hospital provision was available, many more people can

295

return to employment, but we recognise this will result in increased risk of further mortalities. As many governments state

296

however, a functioning economy is more able to provide health provision to those with non-COVID19 life-threatening illness.

297

298

For a gradual release strategy, our simulations broadly suggest that a large section of the population should be released

299

from lockdown initially, after the first peak of infections has fully passed. The rest of the population may then be released three

300

to four months later following a likely second peak in infections. Again, in a general context, it is optimal to wait for one-to-two

301

weeks after the end of an infection peak before releasing any of the population from lockdown. While it is desirable to return

302

the population to work as early as possible, our optimal calculation states that this one-to-two week “wait" period is crucial in

303

ensuring that the number of infected individuals is as low as possible when ending any lockdown measures, to reduce the growth

304

of new cases. After this sufficient, cautious, wait period has ended, people should then be released from quarantine, with the

305

knowledge that as many as 1 in 100 of them (under the worst-case scenario) may require critical care10 in the coming months.

306

It is expected that a second peak in infections may be observed one to two months after this release date, and that the remaining

307

population in quarantine should remain so until, once again, several weeks of low newly infected cases daily have been observed.

308

309

What we have not undertaken here, is to investigate or advocate any particular forms of changed behaviours that might

310

be needed by those released, although understanding them can allow parameters (such as transmission rates) to be adjusted in

311

our framework. Additional measures proposed include: reopening local connections before connecting cities further apart26 ,

312

differential release times based on age27–29 , on-going social distancing9, 30, 31 , contact tracing using mobile applications32 and

313

behaviour monitoring33 , case-finding34 and cyclic schedules (e.g. short working weeks)35, 36 .

314

315

Placing our analysis in the context of other studies, Mulheirn et al. (2020)34 provide a particularly broad and qualita-

316

tive assessment of ranges of possible exit strategies from lockdown. These include release times potentially dependent on age,

317

sector, or geographical region, and the latter including metrics of local health capacity. Such measures can be in tandem with

318

strong policies to shield the most vulnerable. The authors note that with varied approaches to lockdown release by differing

319

countries, there is an opportunity to learn from this by intercomparison. Undoubtedly all countries leaving lockdown, however

320

implemented, will heavily scrutinise data for any evidence of an emerging “second wave” of infections. Noted is the potential

321

for raised levels of testing, in tandem with contact tracing for anyone found to be infected, to slow the spread of COVID-19

322

while at least a partial restarting of society occurs. For all of the options considered by Mulheirn et al. (2020)34 , if the related

323

parameters can be estimated with at least some certainty, then we believe our flexible model structure can adopt these. Hence

324

our simulation framework provides a mechanism to place any suggested lockdown plans on a quantitative basis. Furthermore,

325

where flexibility exists in release times, then for a given strategy, calculation of an optimal solution is possible.

326

327

The nearest analysis to ours found in the literature, based on both a SEIR framework and applied to COVID-19, is by

328

German et al. (2020)28 . Their version of the SEIR equations place more complexity into the infection component, differ-

329

entiating between alternative levels of seriousness with which a person has the illness i.e. from asymptomatic through to

330

requiring intensive care. They also allow for uncertainty as to whether people who recover are immune – an issue likely

331

to be resolved once antibody tests become routinely available. Hence, people post-infection can, in the model, be returned

332

to the susceptible pool. German et al. (2020)28 conclude that without retaining some constraints on the population after

333

the termination of lockdown, then there would be an overwhelming increase in infections. Such constraints include social

334

distancing, isolation of infectious people and contact tracing. They further stress the importance of a considerable increase in

335

the testing of individuals to best inform any release decisions. Their conclusions align with many of our findings, however,

336

rather than assessing constraints applied to the entire population as released simultaneously, our primary focus is to consider

337

additional flexibility to constrain infection levels by a gradual release from lockdown.

338

339

Whilst we believe that our model framework does have predictive capability, we do raise a couple of caveats. We rec-

340

ommended exploring our findings within a variety of other model frameworks. Stochastic frameworks may be better suited to

341

model the exact time periods when populations are first reintroduced, so as to better calculate the range of time frames until

342

a second wave of infections in a probabilistic setting. Likewise compartmental infection models such as those presented by

343

Giordano et al. (2020)9 will be able to provide more accurate estimations on any expected hospital intake.

344

345

In preparing to monitor the situation upon easing lockdown measures, our sensitivity analysis highlights that the recov-

346

ery rate of the disease, γ above, is the most critical parameter in understanding the magnitude of any subsequent peaks in

347

infection. Our calculations can be trusted further if that value is well-understood. For example, if new hospitalised patients

348

of COVID-19 appeared to be remaining symptomatic and infectious for longer that previously estimated, it is plausible to

349

assume within the general community that the disease is therefore being transmitted faster than previously expected. This

350

knowledge could trigger preparations for a potential need to reinstate lockdown measures. Hence further research efforts into

15/19

351

the infectious period should also therefore be prioritised. In a similar vain, the parameter to which results are second-most

352

sensitive is transmission rate, β , and so also worthy of precise research.

353

354

A potential benefit of the on-off release strategy is that it greatly increases the number of people subsequently moved to

355

the recovered class, rapidly bolstering the acquisition of herd-immunity. This in theory would enable the full re-opening of the

356

economy at an earlier date, however it makes the critical assumption that recovered individuals would remain immune to the

357

disease. The nature of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is an open question and efforts are being made to understand its strength

358

and longevity, but currently the WHO advises that there is no evidence yet to suggest that recovered COVID-19 patients have

359

ongoing immunity to a second infection37 . In light of this, the more cautious gradual release strategy remains even more

360

preferable as the scientific community continues its efforts to develop a viable vaccine.

361

362

In conclusion, using an optimal control methodology, we have shown that a gradual staggered release of individuals out

363

of lockdown is recommended to ensure that health systems are not overwhelmed by a surge in infected individuals. It has been

364

well observed that older individuals are more likely to require critical care as a result of COVID-1910 . Although our analysis

365

does not as yet differentiate by age who should be in any partial lockdown releases, this does indicate that, potentially, the

366

younger population could be the first to be released from lockdown. This would further ease any subsequent strain on the

367

health system, and potentially further bolster a herd-immunity effect. Similarly, our analysis does not model the capability of

368

businesses and individuals who have the infrastructure and availability to continue to work remotely.

369

370

The ongoing threat of COVID-19 will require continual monitoring and study in the coming months. It is important to

371

ensure that infections are kept to a minimum, and that the government and relevant services are given enough time to prepare for

372

increases in infections. The findings of this study stress that gradual and cautious action must be taken when easing lockdown

373

measures, to save resources, and lives, while adding to the evidence base of possible routes out of lockdown.
