Abstract
We report a time course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge during
the Spring COVID-19 outbreak in a northeastern U.S. metropolitan area. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
detected in all environmental samples, and when adjusted for the time lag, the virus RNA
concentrations tracked the COVID-19 epidemiological curve. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations
were a leading indicator of community infection ahead of compiled COVID-19 testing data and
local hospital admissions. Decisions to implement or relax public health measures and restrictions
require timely information on outbreak dynamics in a community.

Introduction
The most common metric followed to track the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic within
communities is derived from testing symptomatic cases and evaluating the number of positive tests
over time.1 However, tracking positive tests is a lagging indicator for an epidemic’s progression.2,
3

Testing is largely prompted by symptoms, which may take up to five days to present4, and

individuals can shed virus prior to exhibiting symptoms. There is a pressing need for additional
methods for early sentinel surveillance and near real-time estimations of community disease
burden so that public health authorities may modulate and plan epidemic responses accordingly.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present in the stool of COVID-19 patients5-7 and has recently been
documented in raw wastewater.8-10 Thus, monitoring raw wastewater (sewage) within a
community’s collection system can potentially provide information on the prevalence and
dynamics of infection for entire populations.11 When municipal raw wastewater discharges into
treatment facilities, solids are settled and collected into a matrix called (primary) sewage sludge,
which has been shown to contain a broad diversity of human viruses including commonly

circulating coronavirus strains.12 Primary sludge provides a well-mixed and concentrated sample
that may be advantageous for monitoring community shed SARS-CoV-2. As viral shedding can
occur before cases are detected, we hypothesize that the time course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
concentrations in primary sewage sludge is a leading indicator of outbreak dynamics within a
community served by the treatment plant.

Results
During the COVID-19 outbreak from March 19, 2020 to May 1, 2020 in the New Haven,
Connecticut (CT), USA metropolitan area, daily primary sludge samples were collected from the
wastewater treatment facility which serves approximately 200,000 residents. SARS-CoV-2 viral
RNA concentrations were quantitatively compared with local hospital admission data and
community COVID-19 compiled testing data. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detectable in all
samples tested and ranged from 1.7 x 103 virus RNA copies mL-1 to 4.6 x 105 virus RNA copies
mL-1. The lower concentration in this range corresponds to a qRT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) value
of 38.75 and was used as a detection threshold for this method and sludge matrix. Overall, 96.5%
of all CT values were less than 38 and values between 38 and 40 were reported as positive if
detection occurred with virus nucleocapsid N1 and N2 primer sets and both replicates. Analysis of
the human Ribonuclease P (RP) gene was utilized as a control, under the assumption that the RP
gene content in primary sludge is constant over time and independent of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
dynamics. Replicated samples demonstrated similar SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration values,
while comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 primer values with the human RP gene primer values
indicate that dynamic temporal concentration changes in SARS-CoV-2 RNA were from actual
change in virus concentration (Figure 1A,B). Concentration comparisons between replicates

produced slopes of 0.97 (p<0.001) and 0.94 (p<0.001) for N1 and N2 primers, respectively, while
comparing N and RP primer values resulted in a flat line, with slopes of -0.01(p=0.84) and -0.06
(p=0.25) for N1-RP and N2-RP, respectively (Figure 1A,B).
Sampling during a New Haven COVID-19 outbreak suggests that these data may provide useful
epidemiological insights. SARS-CoV-2 RNA sludge concentrations were quantitatively compared
with data that are more commonly used to track the community progression of COVID-19
including hospital admissions (Figure 2A,B), the positive proportion of COVID-19 tests (by test
date) for the four municipalities (New Haven, East Haven, Hamden, and Woodbridge, CT) served
by the East Shore Water Pollution Abatement Facility (ESWPAF) (Figure 2C,D), and the publicly
reported COVID-19 testing data based on reporting date for the four cities (Figure 2E,F). See
Figure 2G,H for SARS-CoV-2 data. All four measures traced the initial wave of the SARS-CoV2 outbreak in the New Haven metropolitan area; however, the sewage sludge SARS-CoV-2 RNA
results showed a large increase in COVID-19 infections during the first week (March 19 to March
25) not observed in the hospitalization or testing data (Figure 2). Applying a distributed lag
measurement error time series model allowed for estimating relationships between viral time series
results and hospital admissions and testing data. By modeling the epidemiological time series as a
function of the primary sludge SARS-CoV-2 RNA data across multiple daily lags (posterior means
± 90% credible intervals), viral RNA led hospital admissions by 1 to 4 days, proportion of positive
tests by 0 to 6 days, and publicly reported testing data (reported date) by greater than 6 days with
uncertainties in the reported testing estimates.

Discussion
We produced a SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration time course in primary sewage sludge during
a COVID-19 outbreak in the New Haven, CT metropolitan area. Approximately 200,000 people
are served by the treatment facility and COVID-19 total documented cases by testing rose from
less than 29 to 2,711 during the March 19 to May 1, 2020 surveillance period. Our results
demonstrate: (1) the utility of SARS-CoV-2 primary sludge monitoring to accurately track
outbreaks in a community and (2) primary sludge SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations can be a
leading indicator over other commonly used epidemiology approaches including summarized
COVID-19 test results and hospital admissions.
This study uniquely utilized primary sewage sludge instead of raw wastewater for virus RNA
measurements. Sewage sludge is comprised of solids that are removed during primary
sedimentation steps and typically gravity thickened. As a result, primary sludge has a greater solids
content (2 to 5%) than raw wastewater (0.01 to 0.05%). Due to the elevated solids content and the
high case load observed during the outbreak (~1,200 per 100,000 population), the concentrations
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA reported here ranged from two to three orders of magnitude greater than
raw wastewater SARS-CoV-2 values previously reported8, 10, 13. Monitoring primary sludge is
broadly applicable. Wastewater treatment plants with primary and secondary treatment are
standard in many regions of the world, and treatment facilities are expanding in urban areas of
lower and middle-income countries.14 Within the US, approximately 16,000 treatment plants serve
more than 250,000,000 people.15 The virus RNA time course tracked the COVID-19 case data,
thus providing an approach to estimate the number of new cases from the relationship between
new cases and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations. However, these values are not presented here

as we note that compiled COVID-19 testing is prompted by symptoms, thus typically excluding
asymptomatic or mild infections, and underestimating the true number of cases.16
SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in sewage sludge were a leading indicator of community
outbreak dynamics over hospitalization and compiled COVID-19 testing data. The time from
patients shedding to detection in primary sewage is typically on the order of hours, including a 2
to 4 hour conveyance to a wastewater facility, and less than 5 hour residence time in primary
sedimentation equipment. By comparison, delays associated with the onset of COVID-19
symptoms (which prompt testing) and estimated times to hospitalization can be greater than 5 days.
In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic arrived in the New Haven metropolitan area in early March,
2020 when testing capacity, access, and time to results were all under development during the
beginning of the outbreak.
In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge were tracked
throughout a COVID-19 epidemic and compared with traditional outbreak epidemiological
indicators. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in primary sludge followed the epidemiology curves
established by compiled COVID-19 testing data and hospital admissions, but was a leading
indicator. Our study could have substantial policy implications. Jurisdictions can use primary
sludge SARS-CoV-2 concentrations to preempt community outbreak dynamics or provide an
additional basis for easing restrictions, especially when there are limitations in clinical testing.
Raw wastewater and sludge-based surveillance is particularly useful for low and middle-income
countries where clinical testing capacity is limited.

Methods
Sample collection. Primary sewage sludge was collected from the East Shore Water Pollution
Abatement Facility (ESWPAF) in New Haven, CT, USA. Samples were taken daily from March
19 to May 1, 2020 between 8 and 10 am EDT and stored at -80oC prior to analysis. The initial
sampling dates were prior to widespread individual testing in the region, and prior to the start of
stay at home restrictions implemented throughout the State of Connecticut, USA (Figure 1A).
From the sampling start and end dates, cities served by the ESWPAF experienced greater than 85
times increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases (by reported testing) from less than 29 cases to
2,711.17 The plant serves an estimated population of 200,000 people with average treated flows of
1.75 m3/s. Sludge collected from ESWPAF is primary sludge, sampled at the outlet of a gravity
thickener, ranging in solids content from 2.6% to 5%.
Viral RNA quantitative testing. To quantify SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA concentrations in primary
sludge, 2.5 mL of well mixed sludge were added directly to a commercial kit optimized for
isolation of total RNA from soil (RNeasey PowerSoil Total RNA kit, Qiagen). Isolated RNA
pellets were dissolved in 50 µL of ribonuclease free water and total RNA measured by
spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, ThermoFisher Scientific). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified by
one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using the U.S.
Center for Disease Control N1 and N2 primers sets.18 For control, analysis was also conducted for
the human Ribonuclease P (RP) gene. Samples were analyzed using the Bio-Rad iTaq Universal
Probes One-Step kit in 20 µL reactions run at 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 1 min followed by 40
cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30 s per the manufacturer’s recommendations. SARS-CoV2 RNA concentrations were determined using a standard curve as previously described18 and
presented as virus RNA copies. The SARS-CoV-2 concentration results were normalized to the

total RNA extracted to reduce day to day variations in treatment plant flow, sludge solids content,
and RNA extraction efficiency. All samples were diluted 5x for use as template to ensure the
removal of inhibition. Performing qRT-PCR on undiluted and 5x diluted samples typically resulted
in the expected 5x decrease in concentration. Sewage sludge from 2018 was used as a control and
no SARS-CoV-2 detection was observed from either N1 or N2 primers. These control sludges
were consistently positive for the human RP gene.
Epidemiological Analysis. Daily COVID-19 admissions to the Yale New Haven Hospital were
compiled from hospital records upon request from the hospital’s Joint Data Analytics Team for
the New Haven Health System and confirmed by laboratory testing. Hospital admissions only
include residents from the towns served by the ESWPAF (New Haven, East Haven, Hamden, and
Woodbridge CT). The proportion of tests of residents from the four cities that were positive for
COVID-19 and reported by test date were supplied through a data request to the CT Department
of Public Health. Publicly available numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases by
reporting date in the towns served by the ESWPAF (New Haven, East Haven, Hamden, and
Woodbridge CT) were compiled from daily reports published by the CT Department of Public
Health.17
Estimation of primary sludge as a leading indicator was performed using a distributed lag
measurement error time series model. This analysis was carried out in the Bayesian framework,
allowing us to correctly characterize multiple sources of uncertainty when estimating the lagged
associations of interest. See citation19 for a more in-depth description of this analysis.
