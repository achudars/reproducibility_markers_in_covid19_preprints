Abstract
Objective: The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a global health emergency. We aim to
decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune
response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients.

Design: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung
samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who
recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors
(ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The
immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay
of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated.

Results: Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARSCoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19
patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative
transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and
healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory
signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we
identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In
severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK
cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2,
CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as
well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in
lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced IFNγ,
Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2
infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells:
the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was
stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients
compared to healthy controls.

Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung
epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response
to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection
breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a tremendous global
challenge recently. As of May 7, 2020, a total of 3,820,869 COVID-19 cases and
265,098 COVID-19 deaths have been reported affecting 212 countries and
territories, and the number is still growing as a result of human-to-human
transmission1,2. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to coronaviruses family which are singlestranded and positive-sense RNA viruses characterized by club-like spike on
their surface3. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the surface expressed proteins,
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to entry into cells which is similar as
SARS-CoV4-6. In addition to ACE2, the expression of serine protease TMPRSS2
on target cells is required for activation of viral spike (S) proteins to facilitate viral
entry6. However, the ACE2- and TMPRSS2- expressing cell types and their
expression level in the lung of COVID-19 patients are unclear.

Although SARS-CoV-2 could be recognized by the host immune system to mount
an antiviral response5,7, imbalanced immune responses have been observed in
most patients, as exemplified by high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio8-12. Moreover,
a large number of severe COVID-19 patients suffered cytokine storm with
markedly release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6),
interleukin 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leading to the
progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and potentially
death9,13. However, it is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to
dysregulated immune response in the lung of COVID-19 patients.

In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the single cell sequencing data from
the lung of 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 recovered COVID-19
patients with mild symptoms and 8 healthy donors) to uncovered cell types with
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the lung infected with SARS-CoV-2. We
further investigated the patterns of immune cells infiltration and their expression
profiles across the different severity of infected patients as compare with the
healthy controls. We finally evaluated the interactions between the gene
expression profiles of lung epithelia cells and immune cells. Our investigations
unravel the potential mechanisms underlying the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
inducing the aberrant lung epithelial cell gene expression profiles and the
dysregulated host immune response and their correlation changes.

Result
Lung epithelial cells express higher ACE2 in COVID-19 patients
To examine the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes, ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
in different cell types of human lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection, single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3
recovered mild cases and 6 severe cases (GSE145926)14, as well as 8 normal
lungs (GSE122960)15 were retrieved from NCBI database. Unsupervised
analysis identified 20 distinct cell clusters (Figure 1A and Figure S1-S3),
including epithelial (EPCAM+) and immune (PTPRC+) cell populations (Figure
S4). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were primarily expressed in lung epithelial cells
(Figure 1B), in line with other studies16,17. Among lung epithelial populations, a
relative high percentage of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 positive cells were shown in club,
basal and ciliated cells which may act as primary target cells of SARS-CoV-2
infection (Figure 1C). Notably, the percentages of ACE2 positive cells among
these three types of lung epithelial cells were all significantly higher in BALF
samples from either severe or mild COVID-19 patients as compared to those in
lung derived from healthy controls (Figure 1D). In keeping with this, the ACE2
mRNA expression level was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared
to healthy controls in club, basal and ciliated cells, respectively (Figure 1E).

However, the correlation between increased ACE2 expression in the lung
epithelia cells from COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infection needs further
in-depth investigation, considering the small sample size in this study and the
treatment administrated to these patients.

SARS-CoV-2 leads to cellular transcriptome alterations in lung epithelial
cells
We next investigated cellular transcriptome alterations of these lung epithelial
cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection given that they were susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Profoundly altered gene transcriptional expressions in
club, basal and ciliated cells were present in COVID-19 patients (Figure S5-S7).
A total of 65 common up-regulated genes and 53 down-regulated genes were
identified in these three type of cells after virus infection (adjusted p ≤ 0.01 and
|log2Fold change (FC)| ≥ 1) (Figure 1F and 1G). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) of these candidate genes revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced
interferon pathway and cytokine signaling in the lung epithelia cells of COVID-19
patients (Figure 1F). On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 was capable to suppress
host protein translation (Figure 1G).

SARS-CoV-2 infection drives lung immune response
We further studied the specification of immune cells fates in response to SARSCoV-2 infection. As shown in Figure 1B and Figure 2A, ACE2 or TMPRSS2
was almost not expressed in the immune cells of lung samples from COVID-19
patients, as well as healthy controls, implying that the immune cells were not
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By comparing different immune cell
populations between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, we found a
dysregulated immune response in the lungs after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure
S8). A massive increase of neutrophils was observed in severe COVID-19
patients compared with healthy controls, while it was restored to normal after the
patients recovered (Figure 2B). Whilst, macrophage number was significantly
lower in severe COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, but restored in

recovered patients (Figure 2B). SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased
T/NK cells in the lung, but to a lesser extent in severe COVID-19 patients (Figure
2B).

We then explored the differential gene expression profiling of immune cells in the
lung between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. As shown in Figure 2C,
differential gene expression patterns of neutrophil, macrogphage and T/NK cells
were demonstrated in severe COVID-19 patients, mild recovered COVID-19
patients and healthy controls. In severe COVID-19 patients, we identified a
variety of cytokines which were markedly increased in neutrophil, macrophage,
and T/NK cells (CCL2 and CCL3L1), in neutrophil and macrophage (CCL3,
CCL4L2 and CCL7), and in macrophage and T/NK cells (CCL4) respectively
(Figure 2D). The concomitant high expression of these cytokines derived from
the dysregulated immune cells attracted by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested the
occurrence of

cytokine

storm.

Moreover,

the expression of

interferon

Gamma (IFNG), granulysin GNLY (GNLY), granzyme B (GZMB) and perforin
(PRF1) was significantly higher in T/NK cells in severe COVID-19 patients
compared with healthy controls, but their expression levels were restored in the
recovered patients (Figure 2D), suggesting that the cytotoxic T cells and NK
cells were activated in response to SARS-CoV-2, and that delayed expansion of
T/NK cell repertoire might present after virus infection.

The correlation of lung epithelia cells and immune cells is changed in
COVID-19 patients
We evaluated the relationship between epithelia cells and immune cells in the
lung from healthy to the diseased status (Figure 3A and 3B). In severe COVID19 patients, the strength of predicted strong correlations between lung epithelial
cells (club and basal cells) and neutrophils were significantly reduced, but their
correlations with macrophage and T/NK cell were markedly increased. As to
ciliated cells, the correlation network appeared to be the same between severe
COVID-19 patients and healthy control (Figure S9). We investigated the function

of genes constituting the abovementioned network by GSEA gene enrichment
analysis and found that these genes were enriched in pathways including
phagosome, antigen processing, presentation and interferon alpha/beta signaling
(Figure 3C). ASS1, CXCL8 and HLA-B were selected for further validation as
they are among the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung epithelia
cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In both club and basal cells, the expression of
ASS1, CXCL8 and HLA-B were all significantly higher in severe COVID-19
patients as compared to healthy controls or mild recovered patients (Figure 3D).
In supporting this, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the mRNA
expression of ASS1, CXCL8 and HLA-B in human normal bronchial epithelial
cells, human lung cancer cell line Calu-3 and A549 overexpressing ACE2
(Figure 3E). Our findings suggest that the specific networks between epithelia
cells and immune cells were formed in lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion
In this study, we first identified high expressions of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in
ciliated, club and basal cells of lung epithelium in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 are two critical entry genes required for SARS-CoV-2 infection6. The
expression of ACE2 has been reported in a variety of tissues including
respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa18. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA
were expressed in lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and
nasal goblet secretory cells17, and

their protein was detected in nasal and

bronchial epithelium19. However, expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in
the lung epithelial cells in COVID-19 patients have not been explored yet. This
study provides the novel information on the cell types of lung epithelia cells
expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and their expression levels in COVID-19
patients based on single cell sequencing analyses. However, the expression of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not found in immune cells in the lung of COVID-19
patients. In keeping this, no SARS-CoV-2 viral gene expression was detected in
peripheral blood mononuclear cell in three SARS-CoV-2 patients20. Thus, lung

epithelium cells (ciliated, club and basal cells) but not immune cells are
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our further analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 led to host cellular
transcriptome alterations in club, basal and ciliated cells of COVID-19 patients,
resulting in activation of interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. These
secreted signaling molecules serve to initiate host immune response by recruiting
various immune cells21. In severe COVID-19 patients, the accumulated immune
cells (neutrophils, macrophage and T/NK cells), especially massive infiltration of
neutrophils, expressed significantly higher levels of cytokines including CCL2,
CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2, which might contribute to lung
damage. Although T cells and NK cells were reduced in the lung of severe
COVID-19 patients, cytotoxic phenotypes of these cells were recognized due to
significant induction of IFNG, GNLY, GZMB and PRF1. Activation of these genes
were found in cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) and NK cells that inhibit virus propagation
and triggers apoptosis of infected cells22,23. Accordingly, a higher ratio of severe
COVID-19 patients was reported to present T cells specific to the viral antigen
with production of INFγ or GZMB in peripheral blood compared to mild COVID-19
cases10,24. All these findings implied that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the
aberrant epithelial cell gene expression, enriched pro-inflammation signalings
and the dysregulated host immune response in lung.

By investigating the correlation between gene expression profiles of lung
epithelia cells and host immune response, we discovered that the correlations
between host cellular response and immune cell frequencies were altered after
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The interplay between lung epithelia cells and neutrophils
infiltration were diminished; in contrast, their interactions with macrophage and
T/NK cell were stronger. Of these genes that were involved in the network, ASS1,
CXCL8 and HLA-B expression were promoted directly by SARS-CoV-2. ASS1
ablation was reported to ameliorate liver injury by reducing neutrophil infiltration25.
Meanwhile, CXCL8 could recruit neutrophils to the site of damage or infection.

Both CXCL8 and ASS1 presented a weaker interaction with neutrophils after
SARS-CoV-2 infection, implying possible imbalanced control of innate immune
response. HLA-B plays a critical role in the immune system through displaying
foreign peptides. The interaction between HLA-B and T/NK cells were enhanced
in the lung of COVID-19 patients, suggesting the potential activation of these
immune cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, these data suggested that
SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune
cells.

In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces aberrant gene expression profiling
and activation of pro-inflammatory signaling of lung epithelium cells (ciliated, club
and basal cells) that expressing high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover,
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulated lung immune response and massive
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and disrupts the interplay of epithelial
cells and immune cells. All these contribute to the consequent extensive lung
damage (Figure 4).

Materials and Methods
Datasets
Single cell RNA sequence (scRNA-Seq) data were retrieved from published
resources, including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 6 severe and 3
moderate COVID-19 patients14, and lung tissues from 8 healthy transplant
donors15. Bulk RNA-Seq data in three SARS-CoV-2 treated cell lines were also
obtained for validation purpose, including primary human bronchial epithelial cells
(NHBE), Calu-3 and A549-ACE2 (with vector expressing human ACE2)26. All
relevant data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus under the
accession number GSE122960, GSE145926 and GSE147507.

scRNA-Seq data analysis
We re-analyzed the data from a count quantification matrix due to the unavailable per-cell annotation. Cells with mitochondrial gene proportion higher

than 15% were filtered out. For each individual dataset, raw count matrix was first
normalized and the top 2 000 most variable genes were chosen. For each cell,
we divided the gene counts by the total counts and multiplied by 10 000, followed
by natural-log transformation. High variable genes were determined using
FindVariableFeatures in Seurat pipeline27. Multiple datasets were then integrated
via searching the “anchors” among them27, enabling us to explore shared cell
types presented across different datasets and conditions. The integrated data
were scaled followed by principal component analysis (PCA), we retained the top
30 principal components (PCs) for further analysis. The ranking of PCs based on
the variance explained by each PC were draw by ElbowPlot in Seurat and the
majority of true signal is captured in the first 20 PCs (Figure S1). To visualize the
cells, we applied the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) on
the top 20 PCs. The selected PCs were also used for computing nearestneighbour graphs and for clustering the cells. To re-annotate the cells, we
identified the conserved markers for each cluster across different conditions, by
comparing with all remaining clusters using FindConservedMarkers method in
Seurat pipeline. Then, a manual curated cell type marker list was applied to
annotate the cell type for each cluster. MAST

28

algorithm was used to identify

the altered genes under SARS-CoV-2 infection for the epithelial-related
(EPCAM+) and immune-related (CD45+) clusters, respectively.

Bulk RNA-Seq data analysis
RNA-seq reads were mapped onto the human reference (GRCh38 with gene
annotations GENCODE v30) by HISAT2 (version 2.1.0) with the default options.
The number of reads mapped to each of genes was counted by using
featureCount (version v1.6.4). Gene expression levels were calculated as FPKM
(Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) by rpkm method
in edgeR.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using

DESeq2.

Interplay between altered genes in epithelial cells and immune cells
composition
The relative amount of each immune cell type (Neutrophil, Macrophages, T/NK
cells and B cells) was defined as its proportion in CD45+ cells. Correlation
between gene expression and immune composition was measured by Spearman
Correlation Coefficient (SCC) and was computed for healthy control and COVID19 patients, respectively. Those with difference in SCC higher than a threshold
(0.9) between healthy control and COVID-19 were chosen as differentially
correlated pairs.

Functional analysis
Functional enrichment analysis was a method aimed to identify classes of
molecules (genes or proteins) that were over-represented in a set of pre-defined
molecules and predicted its association with disease phenotypes. We performed
this method to uncover potential biological function shift under SARS-CoV-2
infection through mapping the molecules into known molecule sets by
WebGestalt

29

. Two databases, KEGG and Reactome were used for canonical

pathway detection. Significantly enriched functions were chosen if the
corresponding adjusted p-value was below a threshold (0.05).

Statistical analysis
Gene expression levels were represented as mean ± SD unless otherwise
indicated. To compare the difference among groups, pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum
tests was performed. All statistical analysis was conducted under R computing
software.

Figure 1. High ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in lung epithelial cells from
COVID-19 patients. (A) The UMAP plot displayed the major cell types (epithelial,
immune and others) in 20 clusters for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
samples from 6 severe (S) and 3 recovered mild COVID-19 patients (M), as well
as 8 healthy lung controls (HC). (B) UMAP plot displayed RNA expression of
ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Right panel shows ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lung
epithelial cells from different groups. (C) Dot plot of ACE2 or TMPRSS2
expression for each cell-type of lung epithelial cells from different groups. Dot
size represents the percentage of cells in individual clusters expressing a given
gene. (D) The pie chart shows the percentages of ACE2- or TMPRSS2- positive
cells in club (cluster 1), basal (cluster 3) and ciliated (cluster 4) cells. (E)
Expression values of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in different cell types of lung epithelial
cells from different group. (F and G) Venn diagram showed overlaps among upregulated (F) or down-regulated (G) genes in different cell-type of lung epithelial
cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection (severe vs. health). Right table showed the top
10 enriched signaling pathways of common up-regulated (F) or down-regulated
(G) genes. * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001 [Mann Whitney

Figure 4. SARS-CoV-2 infection and host immune response in COVID-19
patients. In COVID-19 patients, the SARS-CoV-2 may infect ciliated cells, club
cells, and basal cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung epithelium and
actively replicate in host cells. This could lead to activation of pro-inflammatory
signaling and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which subsequently
attract

both

innate

and

adaptive

immune

cells

including

neutrophils,

macrophages and T cells to the infection site to fight virus and virus-infected cells.
Besides, the immune cells also release cytokines to attract more immune cells,
creating a positive feedback loop of cytokine creation. Massive accumulation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines producing-immune cells in the lungs could increase
the severity of COVID-19 patients.
