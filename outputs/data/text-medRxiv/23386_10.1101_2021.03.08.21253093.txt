ABSTRACT
Background: Characterizing the kinetics of the antibody response to SARS CoV 2 is of
critical importance to developing strategies that may mitigate the public health burden of
COVID-19. We sought to determine how circulating antibody levels change over time following
natural infection.
Methods/Materials: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis of COVID-19
convalescent plasma (CCP) donors at multiple time points over a 9-month period. At each study
visit, subjects either donated plasma or only had study samples drawn. In all cases, anti-SARSCoV-2 donor testing was performed using semi-quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassays
(ChLIA) targeting subunit 1 (S1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and an in-house
fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA).
Results: From April to November 2020 we enrolled 202 donors, mean age 47.3 ±14.7 years,
55% female, 75% Caucasian. Most donors reported a mild clinical course (91%, n=171) without
hospitalization. One hundred and five (105) (52%) donors presented for repeat visits with a
median 42 (12 -163) days between visits. The final visit occurred at a median 160 (53-273) days
post-symptom resolution. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab), SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG
and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 97.5%, 91.1%, and 74% of donors respectively at
initial presentation. Neutralizing Ab titers based on FRNA50 were positively associated with
mean IgG levels (p = <0.0001). Mean IgG levels and neutralizing titers were positively
associated with COVID-19 severity, increased donor age and BMI (p=0.0006 and p=0.0028,
p=0.0083 and p=0.0363, (p=0.0008 and p=0.0018, respectively). Over the course of repeat visits,
IgG decreased in 74.1% of donors; FRNA50 decreased in 44.4% and remained unchanged in
33.3% of repeat donors. A weak negative correlation was observed between total Ab levels and
number of days post-symptom recovery (r = 0.09).
Conclusion: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified in 97% of convalescent donors at
initial presentation. In a cohort that largely did not require hospitalization. IgG and neutralizing
antibodies were positively correlated with age, BMI and clinical severity, and persisted for up to

9 months post-recovery from natural infection. On repeat presentation, IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2
levels decreased in 56% of repeat donors. Overall, these data suggest that CP donors possess a
wide range of IgG and neutralizing antibody levels that are proportionally distributed across
demographics, with the exception of age, BMI and clinical severity.

Introduction
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), constitutes a global health crisis with devastating social
and economic consequences. As efforts are underway to curtail further spread of COVID-19
worldwide, it is critical to understand the longevity and potency of immune response to
SARS CoV 2. Antibody production represents a significant component of the immune
response to SARS-CoV-2, and serologic assays to detect circulating antibody levels are a readily
available tool in clinical laboratory settings for tracking immune responses over time [1, 2].
Due to the recent emergence of this infectious disease, there is a relative paucity of data on the
long-term kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Studies of individuals who have recovered from
natural infection may help to determine how long antibodies persist after an immunizing
exposure, and whether or not these antibodies might protect against re-infection. The persistence
of antibody response may also help predict the efficacy of vaccines for COVID 19.
COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is an investigational therapy that remains somewhat
controversial, with conflicting reports of efficacy [3, 4, 5]. The underlying principle of this
treatment approach is the passive transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to patients with
COVID-19. Serologic assays therefore play a critical role in identifying suitable convalescent
plasma donors, and provide evidence of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
Importantly, as CCP donors may return for multiple repeat donations, these individuals provide a
valuable opportunity to characterize anti-SARS-CoV-2 serologic responses and to determine
how circulating antibody levels change over time in a well-defined cohort [6].
Of the four major structural proteins for SARS-Co-V2, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E),
and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, the S and the N proteins are both highly immunogenic and
abundantly expressed during the infection [7]. They have been used as target antigens for the
majority of serological assays. The S glycoprotein, however, is surface-exposed and mediates

entry into host cells. As such it is subject to a more stringent selection pressure from the immune
system, and for this reason, it represents the main target of neutralizing antibodies [8].
In the current study, we prospectively conducted a longitudinal serological assessment of CCP
donors after recovery from natural infection. Donors were assessed for levels of neutralizing
antibodies as well as total and IgG-specific S protein antibodies using a lab developed plaque
reduction assay (FRNA) and a commercially available system (Ortho VITROS®). Data were
analyzed to identify correlations between antibody levels and clinical characteristics, and we
present follow-up serological data in repeat CCP donors. Collectively, we present a
comprehensive view of SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics over a 9-month period after natural
infection, increasing our understanding of COVID-19 immune responses among persons with
community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
CCP Donor qualification and plasma collection
COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors were prospectively enrolled onto an IRB-approved
protocol (Clinical Trials Number: NCT04360278) and provided written informed consent for the
study. Eligibility criteria included (1) routine blood donor criteria, (2) molecular or serologic
laboratory evidence of past COVID-19 infection and (3) complete recovery from COVID-19,
with no symptoms for ≥ 28 days, or ≥ 14 days with a negative molecular test after recovery.
We collected donor demographic and biometric data, including age, race, sex and body mass
index. We categorized clinical severity of past COVID-19 infection as asymptomatic, mild (selflimiting course, symptomatic management at home), moderate (emergency room management or
hospitalization) or severe (ICU admission). Depending on center-specific logistics and changes
in demand for convalescent plasma, at each study visit, subjects either donated plasma, or only
had whole blood samples drawn for research; in all cases, anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing was
performed. Based on the results of the previous visit, donors were recruited to either continue
donating plasma, or donate samples for research purposes. Plasma collections were performed by
apheresis, yielding 600 – 825 mL of donor plasma. Sample draws were limited to < 70 mL of
whole blood per visit. The minimum interval between plasma donations was 28 days; shorter
intervals were acceptable between sample draw visits. Routine plasma donor testing was

performed, including standard infectious disease testing, blood group assessment and HLA
antibody testing in female donors.
Plasma for anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing was isolated from EDTA-anticoagulated human whole
blood samples. Samples were processed immediately after collection, centrifuged for 15 min at
2500rpm to separate the plasma phase. The upper plasma layer was extracted, aliquoted and
stored at -80C in our research repository after antibody testing and then shipped on dry ice to the
NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Integrated Research Facility
at Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA, for the in-house assessment of the sample's SARS-CoV-2
neutralization activity.
Prior to August 2020, the FDA recommended titers of at least 1:160 for investigational
convalescent plasma, but a titer of 1:80 was considered acceptable if higher-titer units were not
available. In August 2020, the FDA granted COVID-19 convalescent plasma emergency use
authorization; the criteria for high-titer CCP have subsequently been revised several times.
SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay
Donor samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics
VITROS® Total (IgA/G/M) and IgG COVID-19 Antibody tests following the manufacturer’s
package insert instructions (https://www.fda.gov/media/136967/download ). Both assays have
been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA. The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics
anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay is a qualitative CLIA utilizing luminol-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)mediated chemiluminescence assay, performed on the VITROS® 3600 automated immunoassay
analyzer. The assay involves a two-stage reaction. In the first stage antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
present in the sample bind with SARS-CoV-2, spike protein coated on wells. Any unbound
sample is removed by washing. In the second stage, HRP-labeled murine monoclonal anti-human
IgG antibodies (or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 antigen for the total assay) are
added in the conjugate reagent. The conjugate binds specifically to the antibody portion of the
antigen-antibody complex. If complexes are not present, the unbound conjugate is removed by
the subsequent washing step. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzed oxidation of the
luminol, which produced a chemiluminescent reaction measured by a luminometer. The patient
sample signal is divided by the calibrator signal, with the resulting S/Co (Signal/Cutoff) values
of <1.00 and ≥1.00 corresponding to nonreactive and reactive results, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing assay
Assays for determining neutralizing titers were performed with authentic SARS-CoV-2 (2019nCoV/USA-WA1-A12/2020 from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,
GA, USA) at the NIH-NIAID Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, MD, USA using a
fluorescence reduction neutralization assay (FRNA). This assay was performed by incubating a
fixed volume of virus (0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI)) with an equivalent volume of test
plasma for 1 h at 37 °C prior to adding to Vero E6 cells (BEI, Manassas, VA, USA, #NR-596)
plated in 96-well plates. Following addition to Vero E6 cells, the virus was allowed to infect the
cells and propagate for 24 hours at 37 °C/5% CO2, at which time the cells were fixed with
neutral buffered formalin. Following fixation, the cells were permeabilized with RIPA buffer
and probed with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-specific rabbit primary antibody (Sino
Biological, Wayne, PA, USA, #40143-R001) followed by an Alexa647-conjugated secondary
antibody (Life Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA, #A21245). Cells were counterstained with
Hoechst nuclear stain (Life Technologies #H3570). Cells in four fields per well were counted
with each field containing at least 1000 cells, with four wells per dilution step for each test
sample.

Plates were read and quantified using an Operetta high content imaging system

(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Antibodies were screened using a 2-fold serial 6-step dilution.
Results are reported as the highest dilution of plasma leading to at least 50% reduction in SARSCoV-2 titers (FRNA50) when compared to virus only controls. The lower limit of detection was
1:40. Assays were controlled using a spike protein specific antibody as positive control in
addition to virus-only and uninfected cell controls [9]. All data were analyzed using Excel. To
detect potential experimental errors, we used Dixon’s Q-test, a quick statistical method to detect
gross errors in small samples. We used the critical value of 0.829 for 95% confidence level at
N=4 [10, 11].

Results
COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donor Characteristics
We enrolled 202 COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors between April and November of
2020. The median age of the cohort was 47 (19-79) years, 54.5% of donors were female. The
distribution of donor ABO/Rh blood groups was as follow: A+ (29.7%), A- (5.9%), AB+
(6.9%), AB- (0.5%), B+ (12.4%), B- (0.5%), O+ (33.7%) and O- (5.4%), which was not
statistically different from the US general population

(11,12)

(Fig 1a-c). HLA antibodies were

found in 24% of females. The overwhelming majority of donors reported a mild disease course
(182, 90%). Most donors self-identified as Caucasian (75.7%), Asian (7.4%), Black (6.9%), or
Hispanic (4.5%). Additional CCP donor characteristics are shown in Table 1.

SARS-CoV-2 Seroconversion and Neutralizing Activity at Initial Presentation
At first study visit, donors presented at a median of 50 (18-244) days post-symptom resolution.
Total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 97.5% of donors (197/202) and IgG antibodies
detected in 91.1% of donors (184/202) (Fig.2a). The median S/Co values of CCP plasma samples
using the Ortho total Ab and Ortho IgG assay were 203.5 (0.1-969) and 8.5 (0.01-30.7),
respectively. In 46.5 % (94/202) of the donors IgG antibody levels at initial presentation met the
current FDA EUA high titer criterion of S/Co ≥ 9.5 when tested with IgG VITROS®.
Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were strongly correlated with IgG antibody levels (r =
0.7814, p = <0.0001) (Fig 2b). Neutralizing activity as measured by FRNA50 was observed in
73.8% of samples (149/202) (Fig 2a). The majority of donors (173, 85.6%) had relatively modest
neutralizing activity (FRNA50 titer ≤1:80). Specifically 124 (61.4%) had an FRNA50 titer of
<1:80, and 49 (24.3%) donors had a titer of 1:80, which prior to August 2020 was the minimum

acceptable neutralizing antibody titer for CCP per FDA recommendations. A small proportion of
CCP donors had higher neutralizing activity (FRNA50 titer >1:80), 17 (8.4%) had an FRNA50
titer of 1:160, 9 (4.5%) had a titer of 1:320, and 3 (1.5%) had a titer of 1:640. In our cohort, a
statistically significant difference in mean IgG levels among neutralizing titer groups was
observed (Kruskal-Wallis test; H (6) = 97.84, p = <0.0001). Specifically, average IgG antibody
levels were significantly greater in samples with high FRNA50 titer (1:80 or higher) than in low
titer samples (<1:80) (Fig 2c), suggesting a positive correlation between IgG antibodies and
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. We observed weak correlations between total antibody levels
or IgG antibody levels and duration of convalescence (expressed as days post-symptom
resolution). Specifically, over time total antibodies displayed a weak but significant positive
correlation (r = 0.2676, p = 0.0001), while IgG antibodies displayed a weak negative correlation
of borderline significance (r = -0.1403, p = 0.0481) (Extended data Fig 1a). A statistically
significant difference in mean days post-symptom resolution and neutralizing titer was observed
(Kruskal-Wallis test; H (6) = 19.60, p = 0.0033), with post hoc pairwise comparisons suggesting
a weak negative correlation between the two (Extended Data Fig. 1b).
Correlation of CCP donor Serology Tests and Neutralizing Activity with Clinical
Characteristics
A severe clinical COVID-19 course requiring ICU admission, was associated with increased
levels of total and IgG antibodies at initial presentation (p=0.0006 and p=0.0028, respectively).
There was a trend toward association between COVID disease severity and neutralizing antibody
titer, which did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.0527) (Fig 3a). Increased IgG antibody
levels and neutralizing titers were associated with both increased donor age (p=0.0083 and
p=0.0363, respectively) and BMI (p=0.0008 and p=0.0018, respectively) (Fig 3b-c). We
observed no associations between total antibody levels, IgG levels, or neutralizing antibody titers
and sex, HLA status in females, blood type, or race (Extended Data Fig1c-f).
SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Levels in CCP Donors over Time
105/202 (52%) plasma donors returned for repeat study visits, allowing for IgG and neutralizing
antibody analyses at multiple time points. Repeat donor demographics were similar to our overall
cohort. Most repeat donors presented 2 (44.8%) or 3 (4.3%) times, 20.9% (n = 22/105) presented
for 4 or more study visits (Table1). The median interval between consecutive visits was 42 (12-

163) days and between the first and final visits was 90 (21-206) days (Fig 4a). Across all repeat
donors, the first visit time point occurred at a median of 43 (18-244) days post-symptom
resolution, and the final time point occurred at a median of 160 (53-273) days post-symptom
resolution (Fig 4b).
IgG levels decreased over time in a majority of repeat donors (56.2%, 59/105) but increased in
34.3% (36/105) of donors. IgG levels remained unchanged in 2.9% of donors (3/105). In 6.7% of
CCP donors (7/105), IgG levels fell below or remained consistently below the cutoff threshold
(S/Co < 1) (Fig 4c, Extended Data Fig 2a). Importantly, of the 7 donors with undetectable IgG
levels at their final visit, 3 had undetectable IgG levels at initial presentation and the remaining 4
had very low initial IgG S/Co values (S/Co < 2). For donors whose IgG levels decreased over
time, an average decrease of 30.7% ± 18.8% in the S/Co value was observed between the first
and final visit. For donors whose IgG levels increased over time, the mean increase in IgG S/Co
was 56.6% ± 49.8%.
In our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers over time, for 27.6% (29/105) of
repeat CCP donors the FRNA50 titers decreased, and increased in only 5.7% (6/105) of donors.
In 29.5% (31/105) of donors, neutralizing antibody titers remained unchanged over time or
leveled off to a detectable titer for two or more consecutive final time points. Importantly, 37.1%
(39/105) of donors, had no detectable neutralizing activity over time (n=13) or had titers fall to
undetectable levels (n=26) (Fig 4d). We observed a striking relationship between neutralizing
titer levels at first assessment and titer outcome over time. In general, donors with lower initial
FRNA50 titers (<1:80) were more likely to lose neutralizing activity over time, while donors with
higher starting titers were more likely to have their titer levels remain constant or level off over
time (Extended Data Fig 2b). This can be seen when repeat CCP donors are stratified based on
low (< 1:80) or high (> 1:80) starting titer levels at the study visit. For CCP donors with low
initial neutralizing titer, 60.4% of donors (29/48) lost neutralizing activity or had titers that
remained undetectable over time, compared to 17.5% (10/57) of high titer CCP donors.
Conversely, 31.6% of high neutralizing titer donors (18/57) compared to 27.1% of low titer
donors (13/48) had titers that remained unchanged or leveled off over time (Fig 4e).
Additionally, in the high neutralizing titer group, the majority of donors saw their titer levels
decrease over time (49.1%, 28/57). It remains to be seen whether titers would continue to fall for

these donors, or would level off over additional time points. Of note, no SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was observed in the study cohort.

Discussions
SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of individuals globally and, as of February 2021, has led to
the death of > 2 million individuals (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu ) worldwide. One of the reason
for the explosive increase in cases is the limited pre-existing immunity to the virus. As the
vaccination, effort around the world began with multiple vaccine types and candidates, evolving
variants add complexity to the plan to outrun the virus by vaccination. Cases of re-infections
began to be reported in late 2020 [13, 14, 15]. Most of the reported re-infections were far less
severe than the first infection in those early reports, boosting the optimistic hypothesis that
immune memory of the millions COVID-19 survivors would be able to contribute to the herd
immunity to tame the pandemic. However, Zucman et al. described a somber case that is an
exception to those mild reinfections described to date, reporting a more severe re-infection
caused by the South African variant 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351) [16].
As shown from studies of common human coronaviruses, neutralizing antibodies are induced
and can last for years, providing protection from re-infection or, in some cases, from aggressive
disease [17]. Less definitive data are available for SARS-CoV-2, and the emergence of multiple
viral variants and the potential for more severe re-infection underscores the need to better
understand the body’s natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Undoubtedly, a better
understanding of antibody kinetics and protective immunity will be critical in terms of protection
against reinfection, for public health policy and vaccine development for COVID-19. To begin to
address these questions, we conducted a prospective, longitudinal analysis of 202 COVID-19
convalescent plasma (CCP) donors status with multiple time points over a 9-month period.
Studying recovered individuals provides an important opportunity to investigate both antiviral
antibody quantification and population immunity conferred after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Additionally, having repeat serological assessments allowed for the investigation of how
circulating antibody levels change over time following natural infection.

At initial assessment, total and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 97.5% and 74.3%
of donors respectively. Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were strongly correlated with IgG
antibody levels, and neutralizing activity was observed in 73.8% of donors.
Our study suggests that most CCP plasma donors, regardless of COVID19 disease severity, have
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and more than 70% possess neutralizing antibodies. Notably and in
accordance with already published studies, we have observed a considerable range in antibody
titers in recovered COVID-19 donors [18-19].
When correlating IgG antibody levels and neutralizing titers with clinical picture, our results are
consistent with previously published data, observing positive correlation with disease severity
[20-23], age [24-25], and BMI [26-27]. While some reports observed a correlation between
antibody levels and male sex [28], we did not observe a statistically significant association in our
study. This may be due to the predominantly mild symptomatic nature of our cohort, as males are
also more likely to develop severe COVID-19 [29], presenting a potential confounding factor.
Longitudinal analyses of 105 CCP donors revealed that 93.3% of donors had detectable IgG
levels 9 months after recovery. Although the majority of repeat donors demonstrated a decrease
in IgG levels over follow up, IgG levels decreased by, only 30.7% on average, and seroreversion
to negative was uncommon. Indeed, of the 6.7% of donors with undetectable IgG levels at their
final study visit, just over half of these had no detectible IgG at the initial collection, while the
rest represented cases of seroreversion (overall seroreversion rate of 3.8%). It is unlikely that the
decline in IgG level was related to the number or frequency of plasma donations in this cohort,
since in general, IgG levels do not appreciably decrease over the course of a few months of
infrequent plasma donation [30].
With respect to neutralizing antibody, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels tended to
remain detectable, irrespective of the disease severity. We found that 63% of donors had
detectable neutralizing titers up to 9 months post-recovery, with 25% of donors seroreverting,
and 12% of donors failing to make detectible neutralizing antibody titers over the course of the
study. Although we have observed a decrease in plasma neutralizing activity over time,
neutralizing antibody titers remained measurable in a majority of donors.
Importantly, we observed that if donors were stratified based on their titer level at initial
assessment, 82.5% of donors with high starting titer (>1:80) maintained detectible titers over

suggest that neutralizing activity in the early convalescent period may be predictive of long-term
neutralizing activity retention.
Our results support sustained immunological memory for most of the first year following SARSCoV-2 infection, even for mild COVID-19 cases, consistent with other reports [31-33].
Furthermore, our data suggest that circulating IgG and neutralizing antibodies persist in most
healthy people over the first year following symptom resolution, and longer-term follow-up
studies by others have observed similar results out to 8 months [34-38]. However, other reports
have observed a decline in immunological response over the first months following symptom
resolution, particularly in mild and asymptomatic cases [39-41]. Such discordances could have
major implications for modelling of disease transmission, herd immunity and vaccine strategies.
Moving forward, specific consideration should be given to the selection of the SARS-CoV-2
antibody assays in order to have seroprevalence estimates that are comparable and devise
standardized approaches (e.g. antigen target selection, time of testing, assay sensitivity and
specificity, role of IgA).
The levels of neutralizing antibody activity required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 re-infection are
currently unknown. In our cohort, no SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was identified. However, we
observed a number of CCP donors with no detectible neutralizing activity or who lost activity
over time, presenting a potential problem for immunological protection and herd immunity.
More extensive longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the role of T-cell based immunologic
memory following infection and its relationship to antibody-based immunity. Nelde et al.
observed T cell responses in over half of IgG negative convalescent individuals, and other
reports are mixed on whether T cell responses correlate with circulating antibody levels [42, 43].
In the current study, we present a longitudinal serological assessment of 202 CCP donors up to 9
months post-recovery from generally mild infection. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were
identified in 97% of CCP donors at initial presentation. IgG and neutralizing antibodies were
positively correlated with age, BMI and clinical severity, and persisted for up to 9 months postrecovery from infection. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels decreased below initial level in 56% of
repeat donors; however, seroreversion was uncommon. Donors with low initial neutralizing
antibody titers
< 1:80 were more likely to lose neutralizing activity over time compared to those with initial
titers > 1:80, suggesting neutralizing activity early in convalescence may be predictive of long-

term persistence. Our data suggest that immunological memory is acquired in most individuals
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and is sustained in a majority of patients for up to 9 months after
recovery.

Fig. 3 – Correlation of serology tests and neutralizing activity with clinical
characteristics. Total antibody levels, IgG antibody levels, and neutralizing antibody titers
(FRNA50) in CCP donors are shown based on a. clinical disease course (asymptomatic, n=3;
mild, n=182; moderate, n=14; severe, n=3), b. donor age (19-34yo, n=51; 35-54yo, n=75; 5579yo, n=76), and c. donor BMI (<18.5, n=1; 18.5-24.9, n=79; 25-29.9, n=72; ≥30, n=49;
missing data for n=1 donor). For all graphs, boxplots display the median with 1st and 3rd
quartiles, and bars span minimum and maximum values. Individual patient values are indicated
by dots. Statistically significant differences between groups were determined via Kruskal-Wallis
test for total ab levels and IgG ab levels based on disease course (p = 0.0006 and 0.0028,
respectively) (a), for IgG ab levels and neutralizing titers based on age (p-value = 0.0083 and
0.0363, respectively) (b), and for IgG ab levels and neutralizing titers based on BMI (p-value =
0.0008 and 0.0018, respectively) (c). Post hoc comparisons were calculated using Dunn’s
multiple comparison test, with significant pairwise comparisons indicated on graphs. *, p <0.05;
**, p <0.01.

Fig. 4 – SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in CCP donors over time. a. Boxplots indicate the interval
between consecutive donations and between first and final donation. b. Boxplots display median
number of days post-symptom resolution at indicated donations. For a and b, boxplots indicate
median value with 1st and 3rd quartiles, and bars span minimum and maximum values. Individual
patient values indicated by dots. c. IgG antibody outcomes over time for repeat CCP donors are
quantified in the pie chart, and individual antibody levels are plotted relative to days post-symptom
resolution (n=103; n=2 asymptomatic donors not plotted). Only first and last CCP donation values
are plotted. Samples from the same donor connected by lines. Colors indicate antibody level
outcomes over time: increase (green), decrease (red), no change (percent change <1%; purple),
and negative (levels consistently below or falling below cutoff threshold S/Co <1; black). The S/Co
threshold of 1 indicated by the dashed line. Values below this threshold are represented by an “x”.
d. Neutralizing titer outcomes over time for repeat CCP donors are quantified. Outcome categories
are the same as in c, except: No change/Level off indicates donors whose titers remained
unchanged or leveled off to a titer >0 for their last 2 or more donations, and Negative indicates
donors with consistently undetectable activity or whose titers fell to an undetectable level. e.
Outcomes from d stratified based on the titer at first donation. S/Co, signal to cutoff ratio.
