Research in context:

Evidence before this study

48

We searched for ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed up to Dec 11, 2020, with the terms

49

“COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” and “vaccine”. No language restrictions were applied. We

50

identified 56 vaccine candidates being evaluated in clinical trials, with 12 in phase 3

51

trials. Thirteen phase 1 and/or phase 2 studies have been published, regarding to 4

52

inactivated vaccines, 3 adenovirus vectored vaccines, 2 mRNA-based vaccines and 1

53

protein subunit vaccine. Two phase 3 studies have been published. These vaccines

54

with published data are mainly targeting either whole virus or spike protein. One RBD-

55

based vaccine (BNT162b1, developed by BioNTech and Pfizer) was reported using

56

mRNA expressing RBD-trimer, showing the vaccine is tolerant and immunogenic. The

57

only published protein subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373, developed by Novavax) is

58

based on modified spike protein with Matrix-M1 as adjuvant. To date, a large number

59

of RBD-based protein subunit vaccines are under clinical and pre-clinical evaluations

60

(http://www.who.int), but no clinical studies have been published.

61
62

Added value of this study

63

ZF2001 is one of the two protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates that

64

advanced into phase 3 clinical trials but is the first RBD-based protein subunit vaccine

65

reported for clinical data. Clinical data for protein subunit COVID-19 vaccine using

66

conventional alum adjuvant was first described here. The phase 1 and phase 2 trials

67

evaluated the safety profile, immunogenicity, dose-effect and vaccination schedule for

68

ZF2001. This candidate is well-tolerated, without vaccine-related serious adverse

69

events. Three immunizations at day 0, 30 and 60 achieved 93-100% seroconversion

70

of neutralizing antibodies, with the GMTs exceeding the magnitude of the convalescent

71

samples. Also, this vaccine elicited moderate cellular immune responses, detected as

72

the balanced production of TH1/TH2 cell-associated cytokines.

73
74

Implications of all the available evidence

75

Our findings indicated that RBD-based protein subunit vaccine is safe and

76

immunogenic. Further clinical trials should be performed to investigate its protective

77

efficacy

Summary:

80
81

Background

82

A safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is urgently

83

needed to control the ongoing pandemic. Although progress has been made recently

84

with several candidates reporting positive efficacy results, COVID-19 vaccines

85

developed so far cannot meet the global vaccine demand. We developed a protein

86

subunit vaccine against COVID-19, using dimeric form of receptor-binding domain

87

(RBD) as the antigen. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this

88

vaccine in humans and determine the appropriate dose and schedule for an efficacy

89

study.

Methods

92

We did two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 trials for

93

an RBD-based protein subunit vaccine, ZF2001. In phase 1 study, 50 healthy adults

94

aged 18-59 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to three groups to receive

95

three doses of vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-

96

only) intramuscularly, 30 days apart. In phase 2 study, 900 healthy adults aged 18-59

97

years were enrolled and randomly allocated to six groups to receive vaccine (25 μg or

98

50 μg RBD-dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) intramuscularly, with the

99

former 3 groups given two doses and the latter 3 groups given three doses, 30 days

100

apart. For phase 1 trial, the primary outcome was safety, as measured by the

101

occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events. The secondary outcome

102

was immunogenicity as measured by the seroconversion rate and magnitude of

103

antigen-binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell cytokine production. For

104

phase 2 trial, the primary outcome included both safety and immunogenicity. These

105

trials are registered with ClinicaTrials.gov, NCT04445194 and NCT04466085.

106
107

Findings

108

Between June 22 and September 15, 2020, 50 participants were enrolled to the

109

phase 1 study (mean age 32.6 years) and 900 participants were enrolled to phase 2

110

study (mean age 43.5 years), to receive vaccine or placebo with a two-dose or three-

111

dose schedule. For both trials, local and systemic adverse reactions were absent or

112

mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to vaccine in

113

either trial. After three doses, neutralizing antibodies were detected in all participants

114

receiving either 25 μg or 50 μg dose of vaccine in phase 1 study, and in 97% (the 25

115

μg group) and 93% (the 50 μg group) of participants, respectively, in phase 2 study.

116

The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres (GMTs) were 94.5 for the 25 μg

117

group and 117.8 for the 50 μg group in phase 1, and 102.5 for the 25 μg group and

118

69.1 for the 50 μg group in phase 2, exceeding the level of a panel of COVID-19

119

convalescent samples (GMT, 51). Vaccine induced balanced TH1 and TH2 responses.

120

The 50 μg group did not show enhanced immunogenicity compared with the 25 μg

121

group.

122
123

Interpretation

124

The protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 is well-tolerated and immunogenic. The safety

125

and immunogenicity data from phase 1 and 2 trials for ZF2001 support the use of 25

126

μg vaccine dose with three-dose schedule to an ongoing phase 3 large-scale

127

evaluation for safety and efficacy.

Introduction:

135
136

The coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute

137

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still growing worldwide.1

138

As of Dec 11, 2020, over 69 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in

139

220 countries and regions, with 1.5 million deaths (http://www.who.int). To date, no

140

COVID-19 vaccine has been licensed, although several of them have been approved

141

for emergency use authorization.2

142

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, safe and effective vaccines are highly demanded to

143

control the disease and reboot the society and economics. After one-year global efforts,

144

great progresses have been made for COVID-19 vaccine development,3-17 with several

145

candidates developed based on mRNA or virus-vector platform announced protective

146

efficacy more than 70-90% in preventing COVID-19 after an interim analysis.18-20

147

However, these vaccines so far cannot meet the global vaccination demands from

148

different subpopulations living in different surroundings. Besides, the efficacy duration

149

and vaccine-related safety concerns are yet to be further determined.21 An ideal

150

COVID-19 vaccine should be of high protective efficacy, but safe and deployable for

151

billions of potential vaccinees. To achieve this goal, optimal vaccine target, platform

152

and regimen are of high importance.17 Nowadays, more than 80 vaccines documented

153

in WHO are based on protein subunit platform, suggesting a major platform for COVID-

154

19 vaccine development (http://www.who.int).

155

To response the pandemic, we launched a vaccine development program against

156

SARS-CoV-2. The resulting vaccine candidate, ZF2001, is one of the two protein

157

subunit vaccines that has advanced into phase 3 trial (NCT04646590). Compared with

158

other vaccine candidates in clinical trials targeting mainly whole virus or full-length

159

spike (S) protein, ZF2001 targets SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding domain

160

(RBD). RBD is responsible for the engagement of its cellular receptor human

161

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is an attractive vaccine target to induce

162

immune responses focusing on blocking the receptor binding.22-24 We rationally

163

designed a dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with high yields at level of g/L and

164

dramatically enhanced immunogenicity compared with the conventional monomeric

165

form of RBD in animal model.25 ZF2001 is formulated by RBD-dimer protein produced

166

in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide.

167

We started the phase 1 trial from June 22, 2020 and phase 2 trial from July 12, 2020

168

in China for the vaccine candidate ZF2001. Here, we report the pooled analysis of both

169

trials, in which, vaccine safety and immunogenicity were assessed. Appropriate

170

vaccine dose and vaccination schedule were determined for efficacy evaluation in

171

phase 3 trial.

182

clinical laboratory findings, vital signs, and physical examination. Volunteers who had

183

a history of SARS or COVID-19, or were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 exposure (by

184

real-time PCR assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]), or contacted

185

with confirmed COVID-19 patients were excluded. Exclusion criteria also included a

186

history of seizures or mental illness; allergy to any ingredient in the vaccine; acute

187

febrile disease in 24 hours and digestive diseases in 7 days before enrollment;

188

congenital or acquired immune diseases; serious chronic disease; abnormal chest CT

191

3 month; and being unable to comply with the study schedule. Full details of the

192

eligibility criteria are described in the trial protocol provided in the appendix.

193

The trial was designed with double-blind, randomized and placebo-parallel-

194

controlled. Participants in phase 1 were divided into 3 groups at a ratio of 2:2:1 and

195

allocated to receive three doses of vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg antigen dose) or placebo

196

on day 0, 30 and 60. Participants in phase 2 were divided into six groups at a

197

1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, with the former three groups receiving two doses of vaccine (25 μg or

198

50 μg antigen dose) or placebo, 30 days apart, while the latter three groups receiving

199

three doses of vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg antigen dose) or placebo, 30 days apart.

Procedures
The vaccine was jointly developed by Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of
25

226

Sciences and Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The vaccine was

227

manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice by Zhifei Longcom

228

Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. The recombined vaccine encodes the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

229

antigen (residues 319-537) in dimeric form and was manufactured as a liquid

230

formulation containing 25 μg or 50 μg per 0.5 mL in a vial, with aluminum hydroxide as

231

the adjuvant. Vaccines were stored at 2 oC to 8 oC before use. Vaccine or placebo was

232

administrated intramuscularly in the arm of each participant.

233

For both trials, participants were observed in the observation room for 30-60 minutes

234

after each dose of vaccination for emerging adverse events. During 0-7 days after each

235

vaccination, any adverse events were self-reported by participants daily on the diary

236

cards, but verified by investigators. The adverse events during 8-30 days after each

237

vaccination were reported by participants through contact cards. All serious adverse

238

events within 1 year after the first dose of vaccination were reported. Solicited local

239

adverse reactions at injection site within 7 days post-vaccination included pain,

240

swelling, induration, redness, rash and pruritus and solicited systemic adverse

241

reactions within 7 days post-vaccination included fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea,

242

anorexia, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain (non-vaccination site), arthritis, joint pain,

243

headache, fatigue, acute allergic reaction, irritation or inhibition and mental disorder.

245

were to assess any toxic effects post-vaccination. Adverse events and abnormal

246

changes in laboratory tests were graded according to the latest scale issued by China

247

NMPA (Version 2019).

248

The sera were collected to evaluate the binding responses against RBD antigen and

249

neutralizing activity against live SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells

250

(PBMC) were collected to assess the specific T cell responses. Blood samples were

251

taken from participants at the scheduled site visits before the vaccination, on day 14,

252

30, 37, 60, 67, 90 since first vaccination in phase 1, and on day 14, 30, 44, 60, 74, 90

253

in phase 2. We used ELISA kits (Wantai BioPharm, Beijing, China) to evaluated the

254

binding antibody responses against the RBD proteins according to the manufacturer’s

255

protocol. We also assessed the neutralizing activities against live SARS-CoV-2 by

256

microcytopathogenic effect assay (See Appendix supplementary Methods). PBMCs

257

from whole blood were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen in advance, then thawed

258

before testing. An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay was used to quantify

259

the specific T-cell responses as previously reported method (See Appendix

260

supplementary Methods). PBMCs were stimulated with overlapping peptide pools

261

covering RBD protein for about 20-24 hours before detection, and the number of spot-

262

forming cells per 1,000,000 cells were calculated. We measured the cytokine secretion

263

of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 with BDTM ELISPOT.

264

A panel of convalescent serum samples with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection

265

were obtained from symptomatic hospitalized patients, outpatients and those with

266

asymptomatic infection detected by health-care worker surveillance. The neutralizing

Outcomes

271

For phase 1 trial, primary outcome was the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine.

272

Secondary outcome was the immunogenicity. For phase 2 trial, primary outcomes were

273

both safety and immunogenicity.

274

The outcomes for safety were occurrence of the adverse events between first

275

injection to 30 days after final injection, including all adverse events, adverse events

276

related to vaccination, adverse events at grade 3 and above, adverse events lead to

277

participants exit. It also included all serious adverse events occurred between first

278

injection to 1 year after final vaccination. All adverse events and serious adverse

279

events related to vaccination were analyzed. Comparison between groups with

280

different doses and dose regimens were analyzed.

281

The outcomes for immunogenicity were the seroconversion rate and magnitude of

282

the RBD-binding antibody, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and T-cell cytokine

283

production. Groups with different doses and schedules were compared and analyzed.

284

Serum samples from vaccine group and the convalescents were compared to assess

285

and interpret the immunogenicity of the vaccine.

groups using Fisher's exact probability method. The RBD-binding antibodies,

294

neutralizing titers against live virus were calculated with positive proportion, geometric

295

mean titres (GMTs). The cytokine production was calculated with GMTs. We used the

296

Clopper-Pearson method to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs), χ² test/Fisher

297

exact probability method to compare the proportion differences among the dose groups

298

and Student’s t-test to analyze significance of GMTs between different time points.

299

Statistical analyses were using SAS (version 9.4) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.1).

individuals were excluded, leaving 50 eligible participants in the trial. They were

312

randomly divided into 3 groups to receive vaccine (25 μg [n=20] or 50 μg [n=20] RBD-

313

dimer, with adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only [n=10]). The mean age of all

314

participants was 32.6 years (SD 9.41; range 20.9-57.9), with balanced age and sex

315

distribution among vaccination groups (table 1). 8 out of 10 participants in placebo

316

group, 15 out of 20 participants in the 25 μg group and 18 out of 20 participants in 50

317

μg group completed three-dose immunization and follow-up visits as schedule (figure

318

1, appendix 1).

319

In phase 2, a total of 1085 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility

320

between July 12 and July 17, 2020, in Xiangtan, China (figure 1). 185 volunteers were

321

excluded, and 900 volunteers were enrolled to participant the trial. They were randomly

322

assigned to 6 groups (n=150) to receive vaccine (25 μg or 50 μg RBD-dimer, with

323

adjuvant) or placebo (adjuvant-only) with either a two-dose or a three-dose schedule,

324

30 days apart. The mean age of the participants was 43.5 years (SD 9.17; range 18.8-

325

59.7) with balanced age and sex distribution among vaccination groups (table 1). All

326

450 participants with two-dose schedule completed full vaccination and the follow-up

327

visits. For participants with three-dose schedule, 146 out of 150 participants in placebo

328

group, 148 out of 150 participants in the 25 μg group and 148 out of 150 participants

329

in the 50 μg group received full vaccination and completed the follow-up visits (figure

334

event (figure 2, appendix 2). No statistical significance between these three groups

335

(P=0.1786). Within 7 days post each vaccination, most of the local and systemic

336

reactogenicity was absent or mild (grade 1 or 2 adverse events). The most common

337

solicited local adverse reactions in the placebo, the 25 μg and 50 μg groups were

reported by 0%, 5% and 15%; fever, reported by 0%, 10% and 0%; and headache,

342

reported by 0%, 5%, 5% (figure 2, appendix 2). Two grade 3 (or above) adverse events

343

(10%) were reported in the 50 μg group. One was vaccine-related (swelling and

344

redness) and the other one was serious adverse event (rhabdomyolysis), but was

345

vaccine-unrelated as assessed by the investigators (appendix 9). No vaccine-related

346

serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest were reported.

347

In phase 2 trial, the overall adverse events were low within 30 days after vaccination.

For participants receiving two-dose vaccinations, 37 (25%) in placebo group, 43 (29%)

349

in the 25 μg group and 50 (33%) in the 50 μg group reported at least one adverse

377

antibody titres of the participants are shown in the appendix 4. At day 30 after the first

378

immunization, the seroconversion rates were 61% for the 25 μg group and 79% for the

379

50 μg group; and were increased to 100% for both groups at day 30 after the second

380

and third immunizations (figure 3A; appendix 5). At day 30 after the first dose, the

381

GMTs of vaccine-induced RBD-binding IgG were 23.1 (95% CI, 11.2-47.9) and 40.8

382

(95% CI, 22.5-74.0) for the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively; and were increased

383

to 1077.0 (95% CI, 663.7-1747.5) and 825.5 (95% CI, 486.9-1399.4) at day 30 after

384

the second dose; and were further enhanced to 2719.5 (95% CI, 1584.0-4668.8) and

385

2776.8 (95% CI, 1875.5-4111.2) at day 30 after the third dose (figure 3B; appendix 5).

386

The GMTs were markedly increased after the second and third doses in both groups.

387

To analyze the neutralizing antibody titres against live SARS-CoV-2, we measured the

388

50% neutralizing titres for the serum samples of the participants. The baseline titres of

389

neutralizing antibodies of the participants are given in the appendix 4. At day 30 after

390

the second dose, seroconversion rates reached 93.3% in the 25 μg group and 94.4%

391

in the 50 μg group. At day 7 after the third immunization, the seroconversion rates were

392

100% in both groups (figure 3C; appendix 6). The SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing GMTs

393

were 14.0 (95% CI, 8.0-24.6) and 11.4 (95% CI, 6.6-19.8) in the 25 μg and 50 μg group,

394

respectively, at day 7 after the second dose; and further enhanced to 94.5 (95% CI,

395

49.3-181.3) and 117.8 (95% CI, 64.6-214.9) in the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively,

396

at day 7 after the third dose (figure 3D; appendix 6). The neutralizing titres dramatically

397

increased after the second and the third immunizations in both groups. Meanwhile, a

398

panel of 89 COVID-19 human convalescent serum samples was tested for comparison.

399

The GMT of neutralizing antibodies for the COVID-19 convalescent serum panel was

400

51 (95% CI, 38.3-70.5). Encouragingly, the neutralizing GMTs for both the 25 μg and

401

50 μg groups were approximately two times of the magnitude than human

402

convalescent samples (figure 3D).

403

In phase 2 trial, the baseline antibody titres of the participants are shown in the

404

appendix 4. At day 30 after the first immunization, the seroconversion rates were 59%

405

and 65% for the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively, in two-dose participants; 63%

406

and 62% for the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively, in three-dose participants. At day

407

30 after the second immunization, the seroconversion rates were increased to 95%

408

and 97% for the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively, in two-dose participants; 96%

409

and 94% for the 25 μg and 50 μg, respectively, in three-dose participants. At day 14

410

after the third immunization, the seroconversion rates were further increased to 99%

411

and 97% for the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively, in three-dose participants (figure

412

3E; appendix 7). In participants with two-dose schedule, RBD-binding IgG GMTs

413

significantly increased from 19.4 (95% CI, 16.0-23.6) (30 days after the 1st

414

immunization) to 419.5 (95% CI, 325.8-540.1) (30 days after the 2nd immunization) for

to 344.8 (95% CI, 271.0-438.7) (30 days after the 2nd immunization) for the the 50 μg

significantly increased after each immunization, from 24.4 (95% CI, 19.6-30.2) (30

immunization), for the 25 μg group; and from 22.2 (95% CI, 18.1-27.4) (30 days after

422

1st immunization), to 302.5 (95% CI, 234.2-390.6) (30 days after 2nd immunization), to

423

1140.0 (95% CI, 882.2-1473.2) (14 days after the 3rd immunization), for the 50 μg group

424

(figure 3F; appendix 7). Regarding to the neutralizing antibody titres against live SARS-

425

CoV-2, seroconversion rates and GMTs were analyzed. For the participants with two-

426

dose schedule, 76% and 72% were seroconverted in the 25 μg and 50 μg group,

427

respectively, at 14 days after the 2nd immunization (appendix 8). For the participants

428

with three-dose schedule, 83% and 73% were seroconverted at 14 days after the 2nd

429

immunization in the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively; and further increased to 97%

430

and 93%, respectively, at 14 days after the 3rd immunization (figure 3G, appendix 8).

431

The neutralizing GMT against live SARS-CoV-2 in participants with three-dose

432

schedule was boosted from 19.5 (95% CI, 15.2-25.0) (14 days after 2nd immunization)

433

to 102.5 (95% CI, 81.8-128.5) (14 days after 3rd immunization) in the 25 μg group; and

434

from 12.6 (95% CI, 10.0-16.0) (14 days after 2nd immunization) to 69.1 (95% CI, 53.0-

435

90.0) (14 days after 3rd immunization) in the 50 μg group (figure 3H, appendix 8). After

436

three-dose vaccination, both the 25 μg and 50 μg groups showed neutralizing GMTs

437

exceeding the level of a panel of convalescent sera (figure 3H). Again, there is no

438

enhancement of neutralizing GMT for the participants receiving high vaccine dose (50

439

μg) compared with those receiving low vaccine dose (25 μg).

To assess the T-cell responses, we performed ELISpot assay for the peripheral

cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2 and the TH2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5. As expected, placebo group did

444

not show obvious increase for all tested T-cell cytokines. By contrast, either the 25 μg

445

or 50 μg group elicited moderate levels of both TH1 (IFN-γ and IL-2) and TH2 (IL-4 and

446

IL-5) cytokine production post vaccinations (figure 4). Therefore, ZF2001 induced

447

balanced TH1/TH2 responses in humans.

Discussion:

450
451

S protein RBD is an attractive vaccine target against coronavirus.26 To date, a

452

number of vaccine candidates based on RBD have been demonstrated efficient in

453

animal models against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2.17 Several RBD-based

454

COVID-19 vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials.17 Clinical data have been

455

published for an RBD-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed by

456

BioNTech/Pfizer. This candidate, BNT162b1, is based on mRNA strategy and showed

457

good immunogenicity in humans.14,15 Here, we reported the first clinical study for the

458

RBD-based protein subunit vaccine against coronavirus in a population of 950 health

459

adult participants.

460

We found vaccination with different doses (25 or 50 μg) and schedules (two- or three-

461

doses) were well-tolerated. The incidents of adverse reactions between vaccine

462

groups and placebo groups were similar in both phase 1 and 2 trials, without statistical

463

significance. Most of the adverse reactions were mild, with the most common

464

symptoms being injection-pain, redness and swelling. These adverse reactions were

465

anticipated for alum-adjuvanted protein subunit vaccines and were transient and

466

resolved within 3-4 days post-vaccination. Compared with other COVID-19 vaccine

467

candidates, such as mRNA vaccines or adenovirus-vectored vaccines, the

468

occurrences of fever and fatigue were lower.3-7,10,11,13 Compared with another protein

469

subunit vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, using Matrix-M1 as adjuvant, the occurrences of

470

injection-site pain, fatigue, headache and nausea were lower, as well.12

471

Humoral responses have been considered as immune correlates of protection

472

against SARS-CoV-2.27-31 So far, humoral responses for several COVID-19 vaccine

473

candidates in clinical trials have been reported. It should be noted that currently it is

474

difficult to compare different vaccine candidates as there are no standardized

475

neutralization assays. We used microcytopathic effect assay to determine neutralizing

476

antibody titres for the serum samples from vaccinees, with a panel of COVID-19

477

convalescent sera tested as the control. The comparative immunogenicity showed

478

three-dose of ZF2001 elicited neutralizing GMT two times greater than the GMT tested

479

for the convalescent sera. Notably, two mRNA-based vaccines and two adenovirus-

480

vectored vaccines have been announced 70-90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 in

481

phase 3 clinical trials, with their vaccine-induced humoral responses being reported

482

similar or higher than those from the convalescent samples.3-5,13,18 Although the

483

interpretation of the vaccine immunogenicity can be influenced by the illness severity

484

of the convalescent selected for comparison, our study indicated encouragingly that

485

ZF2001 has the potential to elicit protective humoral responses against COVID-19.

486

Three-dose vaccination was found dramatically enhanced the antibody responses

487

compared with two-dose vaccination, however, increasing the antigen dose from 25

488

μg to 50 μg did not show an improvement for the immunogenicity. Therefore, vaccine

489

of 25 μg antigen with three-dose schedule was determined for efficacy evaluation in

490

phase 3 trial.

491

Cellular immune responses also play protective roles in SARS-CoV-2

492

infections.32,33 Virus-specific T-cell responses were associated with milder disease in

493

COVID-19 patients.34 Based on the levels of spot-forming cells per million cells,

494

cytokines representing both TH1 and TH2 responses were moderately elicited post

495

vaccination. The moderated but balanced production of TH1 and TH2 cell-associated

496

cytokines may benefit for the T-cell-mediated protection rather than the potential risk

497

of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease which is presumably caused by predominant

498

TH2-biased responses .35

499

This trial report has several limitations. First, the participants in both trials were

500

young adults aged from 18-59, not including juvenile and elderly persons, whereas,

501

the elderly is more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the participants had limited

502

ethnic diversity, mainly the ethnic Han. These limitations will be addressed by our

503

outreach study for cohort covering broader age range and ethnic backgrounds. Second,

504

the immunogenicity was tested at day 30 post full vaccination in phase 1 and day 14

505

post full vaccination in phase 2, which cannot be assessed for the duration of the

506

immune response. Immune responses at later timepoints including those at least 6

507

months post vaccination will be obtained in the follow-up visits and investigation. Third,

508

there was still no benchmark to evaluate protective immune responses against COVID23

19. Therefore, although ZF2001 induced neutralizing GMTs higher than the

510

convalescent samples, it is yet hard to predict its protective efficacy. Since no

511

participant had SARS-CoV-2 exposure, we were unable to assess the protective

512

efficacy and vaccine-associated enhanced diseases at this moment. This limitation will

513

be addressed in the ongoing international multi-center phase 3 trials.
