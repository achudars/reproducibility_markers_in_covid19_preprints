Abstract
Background: Weinberger and colleagues estimated that 27,065 of the 122,300 excess deaths in
the United States between March 1 and May 30, 2020 did not have a COVID-19 cause of death.
Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) post weekly data on mortality
for 13 causes of death from the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates
where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death. The 2015-2019 data for weeks 10 through 22
were used to forecast the number of deaths from the 13 causes in the absence of COVID-19
during 2020. The forecast was subtracted from the observed number of deaths for each cause
during the period March 1 to May 30, 2020.
Results: The total of the differences for each of the 13 causes of death, 18,489 deaths, accounts
for over two-thirds of the 27,065 excess deaths not due to COVID-19.
Conclusion: Combining the 95,235 reported COVID-19 deaths with the 18,489 from the 13
most frequent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was a cause
suggests that as many as 93% of the excess deaths were due to COVID-19 and implies that
COVID-19 deaths were undercounted. Ongoing assessment of excess deaths and causes of death
is needed to provide a better understanding of the pandemic’s dynamics.

Introduction
Weinberger and colleagues estimated that 27,065 of the 122,300 excess deaths between March 1
and May 30, 2020 in the United States (US) did not have a COVID-19 cause of death.1 The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) post weekly data on mortality for 13 causes
of death from the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where
COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death. CDC states “Estimated numbers of deaths due to these
other causes of death could represent misclassified COVID-19 deaths, or potentially could be
indirectly related to COVID-19 (e.g., deaths from other causes occurring in the context of health
care shortages or overburdened health care systems).”2 We used these data to provide insight on
those 27,065 excess deaths with a cause of death other than COVID-19.
Methods
The 2015-2019 data for weeks 10 through 22 were used in SPSS Forecasting to estimate the
number of deaths from the 13 causes in the absence of COVID-19 during 2020.3 The forecast
was subtracted from the observed number of deaths for each cause during the period March 1 to
May 30, 2020. Confidence intervals were calculated using standard methods for sums and
differences of random variables.4
Results
The table shows the results using data submitted to CDC through June 13, 2020.

The total difference listed above, 18,489 (95% confidence interval: 12,652 - 24,326) deaths,
accounts for over two-thirds of the 27,065 excess deaths not due to COVID-19 and leaves 8,576
deaths due to other causes.
Discussion
Combining the 95,235 reported COVID-19 deaths with the 18,489 from the 13 most frequent
comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was a cause suggests that
potentially 93% of the total excess deaths were due to COVID-19. Moreover, some of the 8,576
deaths due to other causes may have been COVID-19 deaths. The 93% value is consistent with
an estimate of 95% of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the US in April 2020.5
Compromised care processes (e.g., lack of intensive care capacity) combined with incomplete
COVID-19 testing could decrease the attribution of COVID-19 as the cause of death.
Furthermore, the unknown manifestations and pathology of COVID-19 including being
asymptomatic are additional factors for missed COVID-19 as the cause of death. Based on the
excess death data and known issues in the process of care and identification, we submit that most
of these deaths were due to COVID-19. For instance, the difference for Alzheimer disease and
dementia is likely due in large part to long term care deaths that were actually COVID-19
related. The difference for IHD may be due to deaths where care was not sought due to fear of
COVID-19 or from suboptimal care due to COVID-19 overload.6 Diabetes and hypertensive
diseases have been widely mentioned as increasing COVID-19 mortality risk and those deaths
may actually have been caused by COVID-19. The increase in influenza and pneumonia deaths
may reflect instances where virus testing was not available.7 The negative results for chronic
lower respiratory disease, heart failure, and other diseases of the circulatory system may reflect
situations where COVID-19 pre-empted these causes.
Conclusion
Combining the 95,235 reported COVID-19 deaths with the 18,489 from the 13 most frequent
comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was a cause suggests that
as many as 93% of the excess deaths between March 1 and May 30, 2020 were due to COVID19 and implies that COVID-19 deaths were undercounted. Ongoing assessment of excess deaths
and causes of death is needed to provide a better understanding of the pandemic’s dynamics.
