Abstract

32

Background Pre-/asymptomatic close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were

33

tested at day 5 after contact by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-

34

PCR). Diagnostic accuracy of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) in pre-

35

/asymptomatic close contacts was up till now unknown.

36

Methods We performed a prospective cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy study. Close

37

contacts (e.g. selected via the test-and-trace program or contact tracing app) aged

38

and asymptomatic when requesting a test, were included consecutively and tested at day 5 at

39

four Dutch public health service test sites. We evaluated two Ag-RDTs (BD VeritorTM System

40

Ag-RDT (BD), and Roche/SD Biosensor Ag-RDT (SD-B)) with RT-PCR as the reference

41

standard. Virus culture was performed in RT-PCR positive individuals to determine the viral

42

load cut-off above which 95% was culture positive, as a proxy of infectiousness.

43

Results Of 2,678 BD-tested individuals, 233 (8.7%) were RT-PCR positive and BD detected

44

149 (sensitivity 63.9%; 95% confidence interval 57.4%-70.1%). Out of 1,596 SD-B-tested

45

individuals, 132 (8.3%) were RT-PCR positive and SD-B detected 83 (sensitivity 62.9%;

46

54.0%-71.1%). When applying an infectiousness viral load cut-off ≥ 5.2 log10 gene

47

copies/mL, the sensitivity was 90.1% (84.2%-94.4%) for BD, 86.8% (78.1% to 93.0%) for

48

SD-B overall, and 88.1% (80.5%-93.5%) for BD, 85.1% (74.3%-92.6%) for SD-B for those

49

still asymptomatic at the actual time of sampling. Specificity was >99% for both Ag-RDTs in

50

all analyses.

51

Conclusions The sensitivity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 of both Ag-RDTs in pre-

52

/asymptomatic close contacts is over 60%, increasing to over 85% after applying an

53

infectiousness viral load cut-off.

Introduction

56

The cornerstone of COVID-19 epidemic control has been the implementation of generic

57

infection control measures (hand hygiene, physical distancing, and staying at home when

58

symptomatic) combined with test-and-trace programs. Mathematical modelling studies have

59

shown that test-and-trace programs, in combination with generic infection control measures,

60

can successfully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, even when assuming that up to 40% of

61

transmissions may occur by pre-/asymptomatic individuals 1,2. However, they can only reduce

62

the reproductive number below 1.0 when test-and-trace delays are minimized 3,4. In test-and-

63

trace programs, contacts of infected individuals are actively traced and offered testing,

64

initially only when symptomatic, but increasingly also when pre-/asymptomatic 5.

65

In the first phase of the epidemic, testing was performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase

66

chain reaction (RT-PCR) of combined oral-nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs. The sensitivities of

67

these tests increase as the upper respiratory tract viral load increases, and reaches a high

68

plateau on day 5 after infection 6,7. While RT-PCR is considered the reference test for SARS-

69

CoV-2, it also has disadvantages. RT-PCR testing platforms are typically only available in

70

centralized laboratories and require sample batching, thereby introducing testing delays.

71

Point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 tests became available during the global pandemic, and of these,

72

lateral flow antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) are promising. They require no

73

or minimal equipment, provide a result within minutes, and can be performed in a range of

74

settings with relatively little training.

75

At the end of 2020, Ag-RDT had been evaluated and considered sufficient to replace RT-

76

PCRs, notably if not only in symptomatic individuals. Diagnostic accuracies may, however,

77

be lower in asymptomatic individuals and in samples containing lower SARS-CoV-2 viral

78

loads 8. The latter is not necessarily problematic if lower viral load translates into lower

79

subsequent expected infectiousness 9. The very few Ag-RDT evaluations performed in

80

asymptomatic individuals thus far had small sample sizes 10, did not take into account whether

81

the tested individual had been exposed to an index case 11, nor was virus culture performed 12.

82

Therefore, we conducted this first large scale prospective diagnostic test accuracy study in

83

pre-/asymptomatic close contacts of index cases to quantify the accuracy of two Ag-RDTs for

84

detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR as the reference standard.

Methods

88

Ethical review

89

The Medical Ethics Review Committee (METC) Utrecht concluded that ethics approval was

90

not required because the study is outside the scope of the Dutch Medical Research Involving

91

Human Subjects Act (protocol number: 20/750). All participants signed an informed consent

92

form prior to any study procedure.

93
94

Study design and population

95

This prospective cross-sectional diagnostic test accuracy study was embedded within the

96

Dutch routine testing infrastructure. As of 1 December 2020, Dutch policy encourages close

97

contacts who are still pre-/asymptomatic to schedule a test on the fifth day since last exposure

98

to an index case (referred to as a ‘fifth day test’). In the Netherlands, individuals are notified

99

as a close contact by the Dutch public health service test-and-trace program, and/or the Dutch

100

contact tracing mobile phone application (the ‘CoronaMelder’ app) and/or an individual with

101

a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (index case). Participants were recruited consecutively at

102

four Dutch public health service test sites, located in the West-Brabant region

103

(Raamsdonksveer and Roosendaal) and in the city of Rotterdam (Rotterdam Ahoy and

104

Rotterdam The Hague Airport [travellers were not considered]). Close contacts presenting at

105

these test sites were considered eligible if they were aged 16 years or older, scheduled for a

106

fifth day test, asymptomatic at the time of the test request, and willing and able to sign an

107

informed consent in Dutch language.

108
109

Inclusion procedure

110

Participants arrived at the test sites by car (West-Brabant) or by foot (Rotterdam). Test site

111

personnel approached them and verbally verified study eligibility. Eligible individuals

112

received a study flyer and a participant information letter. After signing the informed consent

113

form, a short questionnaire on presence, type and onset of symptoms (Supplementary Material

114

1) was completed by participants themselves (West-Brabant) or by test site personnel

115

(Rotterdam), while participants waited for sampling. Questionnaire data were extracted in

116

duplicate by two independent persons.

117
118

Specimen collection, testing procedures and virus culture procedures

119

A detailed description of collecting, testing, including culturing, of specimens can be found in

120

the Supplementary Material 2. Trained personnel took two combined oropharyngeal-nasal

121

(West-Brabant) or oro-nasopharyngeal (Rotterdam) swabs from each study participant: the

122

first for an RT-PCR test and the second for an Ag-RDT. Swabs were transported to relevant

123

offsite and onsite laboratories, respectively.

124

During the study period, all study sites were using Roche COBAS6800/8800 platforms for

125

RT-PCR testing (Supplementary Material 2), the sites in West-Brabant were using the BD

126

VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT (‘BD’; Becton, Dickinson

127

and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and the Rotterdam sites the Roche/SD Biosensor

128

SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (‘SD-B’; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Both

129

Ag-RDT were applied according to manufacturer instructions with one exception: BD results

130

were determined visually instead of using a BD Veritor Plus Analyzer. Interpretation of Ag-

131

RDTs was always done prior to (thus blinded for) RT-PCR. Similarly, Ag-RDT results were

132

not available to those assessing RT-PCR results. Participants received the RT-PCR result, but

133

not the Ag-RDT result, to direct further management (such as quarantaine advice).

134
135

At the Erasmus MC Viroscience diagnostic laboratory, samples of participants with a positive

136

RT-PCR test result were cultured for seven days, and, once cytopathic effects (CPE) were

137

visible, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed with immunofluorescent detection of

138

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Rabbit polyclonal antibody, Sino Biological inc.),

139

Eschborn, Germany) (Supplementary Material 2).

140
141

Outcomes and statistical analyses

142

The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy (in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive

143

and negative predictive values with their 95% confidence intervals) of each Ag-RDT, with

144

RT-PCR as reference standard. Since the number of individuals without RT-PCR or Ag-RDT

145

result was very low (n=21 (0.5%); Figure 1), a complete case analysis was performed.

146

Secondary outcomes included the diagnostic Ag-RDT accuracies stratified for a) the

147

occurrence of COVID-19-like symptoms between test request and time of sampling (yes vs.

148

no), b) the number of days between last contact and date of sampling (<5 vs. 5 vs. >5 days), c)

149

different viral load cut-offs and the viral load cut-off above which 95% of RT-PCR positives

150

had a positive culture as a proxy of infectiousness. To the latter aim, Ct values were first

151

converted into viral loads (virus gene copies/ml) using a standard curve (Supplementary

152

Material 2). The infectiousness cut-off was defined as the viral load above which 95% of RT-

153

PCR positives showed in vitro infectivity in cell culture.

154

Finally, we used routine national testing data to determine whether any RT-PCR-negative

155

participants at day 5, afterwards tested positive by RT-PCR or Ag-RDT within 10 days after

156

the initial RT-PCR test, to determine whether testing pre-/asymptomatic individuals at day 5

157

since last contact with the index case, may be too early.

158
159

Sample size considerations

160

Previous Ag-RDT performance studies in symptomatic individuals found sensitivities of

161

around 85%

162

with a margin of error of 7%, type I error of 5% and power of 90%. Hence, we aimed for 140

163

positive RT-PCR tests for each Ag-RDT vs. RT-PCR test comparison. We anticipated a

164

SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (based on RT-PCR) in our target population of 10%, and closely

165

monitored RT-PCR test positivity proportion over time to prolong recruitment if needed.

Results

168

Between 14 December 2020 and 6 February 2021, 5,191 individuals were considered eligible

169

for participation of whom 4,296 participated (Figure 1). Both RT-PCR and Ag-RDT results

170

were available for 2,678 (99.5%) and 1,596 (99.5%) participants in the BD and SD-B group,

171

respectively. The BD and SD-B groups were similar: respectively the mean ages (standard

172

deviation (SD); in years) were 45.9 (SD 17.6) and 40.7 (SD 16.4), 51.3% and 47.3% were

173

female, and 8.6% and 10.1% had developed symptoms at the time of sampling (Table 1).

174
175

In the BD group, 233 (8.7%) had an RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; 149 were

176

detected by the BD Ag-RDT resulting in an overall sensitivity of 63.9% (95% CI 57.4% to

177

70.1%) (Table 1). In the SD-B group, 132 (8.3%) had an RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2

178

infection; 83 were detected by the SD-B Ag-RDT resulting in an overall sensitivity of 62.9%

179

(95% CI 54.0% to 71.1%).

180

In individuals who had developed symptoms between the test request and the time of

181

sampling, the sensitivity was 84.2% (95% CI 68.7% to 94.0%) for BD (N=219) and 73.3%

182

(95% CI 54.1% to 87.7%) for SD-B (N=158). Additional stratified diagnostic accuracy

183

parameters are shown in Table 1. Two by two tables of all primary and secondary analyses are

184

presented in Tables S2 and S3.

185
186

Figure 2 shows the distribution of viral loads in individuals with a positive RT-PCR test

187

result, stratified by a combination of the SD-B Ag-RDT result and the ability to culture virus.

188

Above a viral load of 5.2 log10 E-gene copies/mL, 95% of RT-PCR positive individuals

189

showed a positive virus culture. Using that viral load as a cut-off for infectiousness, the

190

sensitivity was 90.1% (95% CI 84.2% to 94.4%) for BD and 86.8% (95% CI 78.1 % to 93.0

191

%) for SD-B, respectively. Figure 3 shows diagnostic accuracy parameters stratified by

192

different viral load cut-offs. The sensitivity of both Ag-RDTs at the infectious viral load cut-

193

off in persons without symptoms at the time of sampling was 88.1% (95% CI 80.5% to

194

93.5%) for BD and 85.1% (74.3% to 92.6%). Other diagnostic accuracy parameters for this

195

group are presented in more detail in Table S4, and at varying viral load cut-offs in

196

Supplementary Figure 2.

197
198

Finally, routine national testing follow-up information was available for 89% of all included

199

study participants. A total of 31 (1.5%) and 26 (2.0%) individuals had a positive RT-PCR test

200

result within 10 days after an initial negative RT-PCR test result in the BD and SD-B group,

201

respectively.

Discussion

204

To our knowledge, this is the largest study thus far to specifically assess the diagnostic test

205

accuracy of Ag-RDTs in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts. Our study shows that two Ag-

206

RDTs, that are routinely used for symptomatic individuals, have around 63% sensitivity for

207

detecting SARS-CoV-2 in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts. However, both Ag-RDTs

208

particularly appeared to show a negative result – while the corresponding RT-PCR test was

209

positive – in those with a lower viral load ranges. At viral loads above 5.2 log10 E gene

210

copies/mL (the assumed viral load cut-off for infectiousness based on viral culture results),

211

both Ag-RDTs showed sensitivities over 85%, i.e. above the WHO sensitivity criteria defined

212

for Ag-RDTs in symptomatic individuals. Specificity was >99% for both Ag-RDTs in all

213

analyses. About 2% of close contacts who initially tested RT-PCR negative at day 5,

214

developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive after day 5. This rather low percentage

215

indicates that testing close contacts that are still asymptomatic at day 5, is not too early.

216

The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among all adults, both symptomatic and pre-

217

/asymptomatic, tested as part of contact tracing in all the public health service testing sites in

218

the study period, was 18%

219

symptomatic close contacts in our study population. Although the prevalence in pre-

220

/asymptomatic close contacts is expectedly lower, it is considerably higher than the

221

prevalence of 0.8%-1% (at the time of the study period) as estimated in the general population

222

of the Netherlands 16, and in other countries 17,18.

223

Only about 2% of close contacts who initially tested RT-PCR negative at day 5 after the close

224

contact developed symptoms and subsequently tested positive, i.e. infections missed by RT-

225

PCR on day 5 after exposure to an index case. These proportions of ‘missed’ infections are

226

expected to increase when using an Ag-RDT instead of RT-PCR. This underlines the

16

. This percentage is comparable to the prevalence among

227

importance of immediate self-isolation and repeat testing when symptoms develop after a

228

negative day 5 Ag-RDT.

229

The extent to which the lower sensitivity of Ag-RDTs compared to RT-PCR outweighs the

230

positive effects of simplified logistics, reduced delays, and the potential for self-testing, is

231

currently unknown. We will monitor this utiziling national test-and-trace information.

232

Modeling studies will also help to further address this question in the future.

233

We were also able to minimize missing values and measurement bias by taking samples for

234

the Ag-RDT and RT-PCR from each participant at the same time, using the same Ag-RDT

235

and RT-PCR reference test for all participants, and having all (index and reference) tests

236

performed by trained personnel who were blinded to the result of the other test.

237

Our study also has some potential limitations. First, although we aimed to sample pre-

238

/asymptomatic individuals at five days after exposure to an index case, 12% was sampled

239

before the fifth day since last contact. It is known that the accuracy of the RT-PCR reference

240

test is not yet optimal before the fifth day after contact with an index case 6. Interestingly

241

though, our stratified analysis indicated that the RT-PCR positivity fraction was actually

242

higher in close contacts who were sampled before the fifth day since last contact. We

243

hypothesize that some of these individuals have had prolonged contact with the index case,

244

for example because they live in the same household. Close contacts living in the same

245

household on average test more often positive compared to non-household close contacts

246

(20% vs. 10%) 16. This would also explain why these close contacts reported to have contact

247

with the index case less than 5 days ago, as the last contact with an infected household

248

member could be the same day of testing. A second limitation is that virus culture was only

249

available in one of the two central laboratories. Hence, the assumed infectiousness viral load

250

cut-off was extrapolated to the second laboratory. Reassuringly, the RT-PCR calibration

251

curves of both laboratories indicated that Ct values corresponded to similar viral loads in both

252

laboratories. A correlation between infectivity in culture and viral load of the specimen as

253

well as negative associations between lower viral loads and secondary attack rates have been

254

established 19-22. Some uncertainty remains as the exact upper respiratory tract viral load cut-

255

off below which transmissions no longer take place is yet unknown, and due to high

256

variability in methodologies and results between laboratories and studies 21,22.

257

The Dutch Outbreak Management Team (OMT) that provides guidance to the Ministry of

258

Health, Welfare and Sport on policy regarding COVID-19, advised, based on the results of

259

this study, that pre-/asymptomatic close contacts of individuals with a confirmed SARS-CoV-

260

2 infection can be tested for SARS-CoV-2 using an Ag-RDT. As a result the Dutch policy

261

now allows testing of close contacts using Ag-RDTs from day 5 onwards, even when they

262

have not (yet) developed symptoms. Accordingly, positive test results are known and

263

communicated earlier such that the use of Ag-RDTs in pre-/asymptomatic close contacts has

264

the potential to help prevent onward SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
