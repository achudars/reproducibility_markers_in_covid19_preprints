Summary: Imported and second-generation cases manifested less complications, lower
fatality, and higher discharge rate than initial cases, which may be related to the shorter
interval from symptom onset to hospital admission, younger age, and higher lymphocyte
count of the imported and second-generation patients. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level
could be used as indicators for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis was found in later
chest CT images in more than half of the pneumonia cases and should be taken into account.

Abstract
Background
The mortality of COVID-19 differs between countries and regions. By now, reports on
COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the
clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases.
Methods
This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9
cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from
medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further
profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients.
Results
34.3% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2% had complications. As of March 7,
2020, 91.8% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7%) died. The median age was 46
years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days.
The median lymphocyte count was 1.1×109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL,
LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P<0.05). Baseline
lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it
increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6
level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary
fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5% of the pneumonia cases.
Conclusion
Imported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause occurred in the city
Wuhan in China.[1] In early January, 2020, a novel betacoronavirus was isolated[2] from the
bronchoalveolar lavage samples of the infected patients, and the pathogen was named severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel
coronavirus , 2019-nCoV). In February 2020, WHO officially designated the syndrome as
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Due to human-to-human transmission,[3, 4] COVID-19 has spread rapidly. As of March
27, 2020, a total of 82078 cases have been confirmed in China and 509164 cases have been
reported in more than 200 countries and 5 continents.[5] The clinical spectrum of COVID-19
appears to be wide, including asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory tract illness, and
severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death.[6] The mortality of COVID-19 is
different among countries and regions, for instance 4.02% in China, 0% in Vietnam, 10.14%
in Italy, 1.45% in USA，and 0.44% in Austrilia.[5]
So far, studies on the epidemic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have mainly
concentrated on initial or first-generation cases. Information about imported and
second-generation cases is limited. In this study, we focused on Shaanxi province as a region
with imported and second-generation cases and described the clinical and laboratory
characteristics of 134 COVID-19 cases in this province with a hope to provide some insight
into the prevention and treatment of the disease in China and elsewhere.

Study design and participants
This retrospective study included 134 confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted and treated in
10 designated hospitals across 9 cities (Xi’an, Ankang, Baoji, Hanzhong, Weinan, Xianyang,
Shangluo, Yan’an, Tongchuan) in Shaanxi province from January 23, 2020 to March 7, 2020
(Supplementary Material). SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined in accordance with Version
7.0 of the guideline issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of
China.[7]

Data collection
The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics as well
as treatment and outcome data were collected from patients’ electronic medical records using
a standardised case report form. Clinical outcomes were followed up until March 7, 2020.
The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. If information was not clear, the
research team contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.
Because of the urgent need to collect data regarding this emerging pathogen, requirement for
informed consent was waived.

Laboratory confirmation
Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was performed immediately after admission and
verified by the Shaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A
confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as a positive result to high-throughput sequencing or
real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and

pharyngeal swab samples or sputum specimens.[8]

Diagnostic criteria
The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. Fever was
defined as axillary temperature above 37.3℃. ARDS was defined in accordance with the
Berlin definition.[9] Acute kidney injury was identified based on the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes definition.[10] Cardiac injury was determined when the serum
levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin I/T) were above the 99th percentile upper

guidelines for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia.[12]
Severity of COVID-19 was categorized into non-severe group (mild and moderate) and
severe group (sever and critically ill) based on Version 7.0 of the guideline issued by the
National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.[7]

Statistical analysis
The cohort of patients was divided into severe and non-severe cases. Continuous and
categorical variables were expressed as median (IQR) and n (%), respectively. The
Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables and χ² test or Fisher’s exact test (when
the data were limited) was used for categorical variables to compare differences between
severe and non-severe cases where appropriate. All statistical analyses were performed with
SPSS software, version 23.0. A two-sided α of less than 0·05 was considered statistically

Result
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics
This study recruited a total of 134 patients from 9 cities in Shaanxi province, who were
confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 23, 2020 to March 7, 2020. The median
age of the patients was 46 years old (IQR 34-58), ranging from 4 to 89 years, and more than
half (69, 51.5%) were female (Table 1). Altogether 88 (65.7%) cases were non-severe and 46
(34.3%) were severe, including two critically ill cases (1.5%) with one patient unable to
survive (0.7%) (Table 4). The age of severe patients were significantly older than that of
non-severe patients (median, 56 years vs. 41 years, P <0.05). Moreover, the proportion of
patients aged 65 or older was higher (32.6% vs. 5.7%, P <0.05), and the proportion of
patients aged 14-30 was lower (4.3% vs. 21.6%, P <0.05) in the group of severe patients than
in non-severe patients (Table 1).
None of the patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market or wild
animals. The majority of the cases were community-infected and three cases were
hospital-infected. Of these patients, 59 (44%) resided in Wuhan or had short trips to Wuhan

before the onset of COVID-19; 40 (29.9%) had close contact with someone from Wuhan; 20
(14.9%), including 3(2.2%) medical staff, had exposure to COVID-19 patients; 15 (11.2%)
had no definite epidemiological history; and 71(53%) patients got infected as familial
clustering (Table 1).
Of the 134 patients, 58 (43.3%) had one or more coexisting medical conditions, the most
common of which was hypertension (14.9%), followed by diabetes (6.7%), cardiovascular
disease (4.5%) and cerebrovascular disease (4.5%)(Table 1). The most common symptoms at
onset were cough (96, 71.6%), followed by fever (87, 64.9%)(Table 2). The incidence of
chest stuffiness and dyspnea differed between severe and no-severe cases (Table 2, both P <
0.05). The median interval from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR
3-7) days, and that to positive result of nucleic acid detection was 5 (IQR 3-9) days. The
median duration from hospital admission to discharge was 17 days (IQR 14-20) (Table 1).
Upon admission, measures of vital signs were recorded for all patients. The incidences of
temperature >38℃, respiratory rate > 21 breaths per minute, heart rate > 100 beats per
minute and median systolic pressure showed difference between severe and no-severe cases
(Table 2, all P < 0.05). All of these are higher in severe cases compared to in non-severe
cases.

Radiological and laboratory findings
94.0% (126/134) of the patients showed abnormal chest CT images, consisting of 26 cases
(26/134, 19.4%) of unilateral pneumonia and 100 cases (100/134, 74.6%) of bilateral
pneumonia, with ground-glass opacity as the typical hallmark finding. Among the patients,

26 patients (19.4%) showed multiple patchy shadowing, 26 cases (19.4%)

subsegmental

consolidation with air bronchogram (5, 3.7%) , with 2 cases (1.5%) having progressed to
“white lung”. Additionally, pleural effusion occured in 6 patients (4.5%) and pneumothorax
occurred in 1 patient (0.7%) . When the shadow or consolidation were resolved, fibrous
stripes or pulmonary fibrosis were found on later chest CT images of 69 (51.5%) patients
(Table 2). Moreover, the incidences of bilateral pneumonia, pleural effusion and pulmonary
fibrosis were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases (Table 2, all P < 0.05).
Upon admission, 25 (18.7%) of the patients showed leucopenia (white blood cell count
<3.5×109/L) and 51 (38.1%) showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.1×109 /L). In most
patients, leukocytes (107, 79.9%) and lymphocytes (82, 61.2%) were within the normal
ranges. Only two patients (1.5%) had increased leukocytes and one patient (0.7%) had
elevated lymphocytes. The median values of C-reactive protein (10.0, IQR 9.0-38.3, mg/L),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (38.5, IQR 17.8-74.8, mm/h), interleukin-6 (8.1, IQR 5.0-23.0,
pg/ml), and direct bilirubin (4.9, IQR 3.3-7.5, umol/L) elevated in the patients. The median
partial pressure of oxygen level was 80 mmHg (IQR 67-92), and the median of oxygenation
index (PaO2:FiO2) was 255 mmHg (IQR 210-307) (Table 3).
A number of laboratory parameters showed higher values in severe patients as compared
with in non-severe patients (Table 3), including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), direct bilirubin (DBIL), glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Table 3, all P <
0.05). In addition, lymphocyte count, albumin, PaO2, and PaO2:FiO2 were comparatively
lower in severe patients than in non-severe patients (Table 3, all P < 0.05).

Complications, treatment and outcomes
During hospitalization, 15 (11.2%) of the patients had complications, including arrhythmia (4,
3.0%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (3, 2.2%), acute kidney injury (3, 2.2%),
ventilator-associated pneumonia (2, 1.5%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome(2, 1.5%)
and shock (1, 0.7%). Most of the complications (13 out of 15, 86.7%) occurred in the group
of severe cases and the incidence of complications was comparatively higher in severe cases
than in non-severe cases (28.3% vs. 2.3%, P< 0.05) (Table 4).
As for therapeutic management, 91 (67.9%) patients received oxygen inhalation, The two
critical illness cases (1.5%) were treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), of whom one
switched to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as salvage therapy, and the other
died before switching to invasive mechanical ventilation (Table 4).
Of the 134 patients, 23 (17.2%) experienced a secondary bacteria infection, 3(2.2%) were
detected as positive for secondary fungus infection, and 6(4.5%) had other viruses infection
(Table 3). Empirical single antibiotic treatment, mainly moxifloxacin, was given to 103
patients (76.9%), with a median duration of 10 days (IQR 7-14). Most patients (129, 96.3%)
received antiviral therapy (median duration 13 days, IQR 8-17), including lopinavir/ritonavir
(87, 64.9%), interferon alpha inhalation (68, 50.7%), arbidol (57,42.5%), ribaviron (44,
32.8%), and chloroquine (3, 2.2%). The median interval from onset of symptoms to antiviral
therapy was 6.0 (IQR 4-9) days (Table 4). Additionally, 2 patients (1.5%) received antifungal
treatment (Table 4).

Glucocorticoid therapy (median duration 3 days, IQR 2.0-5.5) was performed in 41
patients (30.6%), the duration of which is remarkably longer in severe cases than in
non-severe cases (median 5 vs. 3, P<0.05). The median interval from onset of symptoms to
glucocorticoid therapy was 6 days (IQR 5.0-10.3). In addition, 13 cases (9.7%) was supported
with gamma globulin (median 4 days, IQR 3.0-7.0). Significantly more severe cases were
given oxygen inhalation, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroid and gamma globulin (all
P<0.05, Table 4).
By March 7, 2020, 123(91.8%) of the 134 patients had been discharged and one critical
patient (0.7%) had died. The remaining 9 patients (6.7%) still under treatment were largely
severe cases (7 out of 46 severe, 15.2% vs. 2 out of 88 non-severe, 2.3%, P<0.05) (Table 4).
Fitness for discharge was based on abatement of fever for at least three days, significantly
improved respiratory symptoms, and negative result for two consecutive respiratory
pathogenic nucleic acid tests (sampling interval at least 1 day).

Dynamic Profile of Laboratory Findings in Patients With COVID-19
To determine the major clinical features during COVID-19 progression, the dynamic changes
of six clinical laboratory parameters, namely, lymphocyte, interleukin-6 (IL-6), CRP, LDH,
HBDH, and DBIL, were monitored every other day from day 1 to day 8 after hospital
admission. By January 28, 2020, data of the complete clinical course from seven patients,
including five randomly selected discharged patients, the critical case managed with ECMO,
and the non-survivor case, were analyzed (Figure 1). Baseline lymphocyte count was
significantly higher in survivors than in the non-survivor patient. In survivors, the

lymphocyte count was lowest on day 5 after admission and increased gradually during
hospitalization. Whereas, the non-survivor patient developed more severe lymphopenia
(0.19×109/L) over time. The level of IL-6 in survivors displayed a gradual decrease to normal
range with the condition improved, but increased unexpectedly to a very high value
(5001pg/ml) before death in the non-survivor case.
Compared with those in the recovered patients, levels of CRP, LDH, HBDH, and DBIL in
the two critically ill patients were higher throughout the clinical course (Figure 1). In the
recovered patients，the levels of all the four markers reached the peak on day 3 after
admission and decreased subsequently during recovery. In the two critically ill cases, the
levels increased rapidly from day 3 with condition deterioration.

Discussion
No patient enrolled in this multicenter study had been exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market
or wild animals. The majority of the patients had a clear history of having been in Wuhan or
in close contact with individuals from Wuhan or patients with COVID-19, and a large
number of them were family clusters (53%). These data have provided further evidence that
SARS-CoV-2 has a strong ability for human-to-human transmission.[3, 4] Besides, the fact
that 11.2% of the patients had no definite epidemiological history might suggest the
possibility of transmission from asymptomatic individuals. At present, confirmed COVID-19
patients are the main source of infection, but what deserves particular attention is
asymptomatic transmission, which could be another source of infection. Moreover, 44% of
the patients had a histroy of exposure in Wuhan, but 56% had never been to Wuhan and had

been infected outside Wuhan. This suggests a gradual shift of imported infection to
second-generation local infection.
The percentage of male patients in our data was 48.5%, different from the male patient
predominence reported in two studies on Wuhan cases (73% in Huang et al[13]
and 68% in Chen et al[14] ). In this study, the male-female ratio was approximately 1:1.06,
with no difference between severe and non-severe cases. This finding is contradicting to the
previous conclusion that men were more susceptible than women to SARS-CoV-2.[14, 15]
This might be related to occupational exposures, for more men than women work as salesmen
or market managers in seafood markets. As recorded, 66.0% of the patients in Huang’s report
and 49% of the patients in Chen’s report had the history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood
Market, and most of the affected patients were male workers.[13, 14] In contrast, no patient
in our study had such exposure. All of these indicated a change of transmission mode outside
Wuhan and that gender may not be a susceptible factor for COVID-19.
The median age of our patients was 46 years old, close to that of patients outside Wuhan as
reported by Wu et al (46 years)[16]and Xu et al (41 years),[17] and younger than that of
patients in Wuhan as reported by Wang et al (56 years)[18]and Chen et al (55
years).[14]Similarly, severe patients were much older than non-severe patients. This suggests
that age may be an important risk factor for poor outcome. The role of age in COVID-19
seems to be similar to its role in SARS and MERS, which has been reported as an
independent predictor of adverse outcome.[19, 20] T-cell and B-cell hypofunction and
excessive production of type 2 cytokines in older people could lead to defect in inhibition of
viral replication and stronger host innate responses with sustained cytokine storm, potentially

leading to poor outcome.[21] Therefore, compromised immune function might be the major
cause of higher mortality in older people infected by coronaviruses.
The proportion of severe cases in Shaanxi was close to that in Wuhan as reported by Wang
et al.,[18] while the incidence of complications and mortality were considerably lower among
Shaanxi patients than among the initially infected Wuhan patients.[13, 14, 18] Only two cases
in our cohort needed mechanical ventilation. This might indicate that patients outside Wuhan
had a much better prognosis than the first generation patients in Wuhan. What’s more, of the
cases in Wuhan, those initially identified had a higher mortaility than those confirmed and
treated later (15%[13] vs. 11%[14] vs. 4.3%[18]). This phenomenon was similar to that
during the transmission of MERS-CoV, in which the global mortality of the first-generation
MERS-CoV was about 35.5%, while that of the second-generation was around 20%.[22]
Furthermore, the median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission in Shaanxi cases
was shorter than in Wuhan cases (4.5 vs. 7 days).[13, 18] and the Shaanxi patients were
younger than those in Wuhan (46 vs. 55-62 years).[14, 15, 18] These may be reasons for the
notable reduction in mortality in Shaanxi cases.
The percentage of cases having fever in our cohort was lower than that reported in
Wuhan.[13, 14, 18] In this regard, patients with normal temperature may be missed if the
surveillance case definition focused heavily on fever detection. Compared with non-severe
patients, severe patients more commonly had symptoms and signs such as cough, sputum,
chest stuffiness, dyspnea, temperature above 38℃, respiratory rate above 21 breaths per
minute, and heart rate above 100 beats per minute. The onset of symptoms and signs may
assist physicians in identifying patients with greater severity.

Based on the radiological data, the incidences of bilateral pneumonia and pleural
effusion were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases, which suggested greater
disease severity. Similar to what was reported by Sun et al,[23] in 54.7% (69/126) of the
pneumonia cases, pulmonary fibrosis was found in later chest CT images when shadowing
had been resolved, and the phenomenon was more common in severe patients than in
non-severe patients. These findings consistently suggest that pulmonary fibrosis can be one
of the sequelaes of COVID-19. It is necessary and important to explore how to prevent and
reduce the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis and how to manage the situation whenever it
occurs in the treatment of COVID-19.
In terms of laboratory tests, different from cases in Wuhan, most Shaanxi patients had
lymphocytes within the normal range, and only 38.1% showed lymphopenia. The lymphocyte
absolute count in our cohort of patients (1.1×109/L) was higher than that reported in Wuhan
patients (0.6-0.8×109/L).[13, 18, 24] This may be another reason for the lower mortality of
Shaanxi cases as compared with of Wuhan cases. In severe cases, the lymphocyte count was
lower and the incidence of lymphopenia was higher. These findings suggest that
SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, and the severity
of lymphopenia might reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, levels of
inflammatoryparameters, such as CRP and ESR elevated in COVID-19 patients and were
even higher in severe patients. The changes of these laboratory parameters illustrated that the
virus invaded through respiratory mucosa and spread in the body, triggering a series of
immune responses and inducing severe inflammation and cytokine storm in vivo.[25]
Few patients in our study had abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate

aminotransferase (AST), and indirect bilirubin (IDBIL). The median level of DBIL in the
patients elevated, and was even higher in severe patients. As reported, the potential
mechanism of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 could be that the virus might directly bind to
ACE2 positive bile duct cells.[26] Therefore, the liver abnormality of COVID-19 patients
may not be caused by liver cell damage, but by bile duct cell dysfunction.
In addition, elevated glucose, LDH, HBDH, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide, as well as
declined albumin, PaO2, and PaO2:FiO2, were more commonly seen in severe cases,
suggesting greater disease severity.
The dynamic changes of six laboratory markers showed that baseline lymphocyte count
was significantly higher in survivors than in the non-survivor patient. The lymphocyte count
showed a gradual increase as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death
occurred. Conversely, the IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but continually rose
to a very high level in the non-survivor patient. Hence, we assume that T cellular immune
function might relate to mortality, and lymphocyte and IL-6 should be used as indicators for
prognosis. Additionally, CRP, LDH, HBDH, and DBIL levels decreased as the condition
improved in recovered patients, but increased rapidly as the condition worsened in the
non-survivor patient and the critical case. These may be related to cytokine storm and bile
duct cell dysfunction induced by virus invasion.
Most patients (96.3%) in our study received antiviral therapy, including lopinavir/ritonavir
(64.9%), interferon alpha inhalation (50.7%), arbidol (42.5%), ribaviron (32.8%) and
chloroquine (2%).Up to now, no specific treatment has been recommended for COVID-19
infection except for optimal supportive care. A previous study showed that combination of

lopinavir and ritonavir was associated with substantial clinical benefit for SARS infection.[27]
Another study claimed that remdesivir had a good therapeutic effect on COVID-19.[28]
Currently, randomised clinical trials for lopinavir/ritonavir (ChiCTR2000029308) and
intravenous remdesivir (NCT04257656, NCT04252664) in treatment of COVID-19 are in
progress.[24] Meanwhile, COVID-19 vaccine is highly expected. Ongoing efforts are needed
to explore effective therapies for this emerging acute respiratory infection.

Limitations of study
This study has some limitations. First, as only COVID patients in Shaanxi were recruited, our
conclusions need to be further verified by recruiting larger number of cases of other
provinces or cities, outside Wuhan. Second, there were 2 critically ill cases with 1
non-survivor in our study, thus dynamic observations of laboratory parameters between
non-survivor and survivor, recovered cases and critically ill cases were just
descriptive analysis. Larger number of critically ill cases are needed to verify our
observation.

Conclusion
In summary, the present study identified that the imported and second-generation COVID-19
cases in Shaanxi had a better prognosis in comparation with initial or first-generation cases in
Wuhan, with less complications, lower fatality, and higher discharge rate. These differences
may be related to the shorter interval from symptom onset to hospital admission, younger age,
and higher lymphocyte count of patients in Shaanxi. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could

be used as indicators for evaluating prognosis. CRP, LDH, HBDH, and DBIL levels could
help estimate the severity and development tendency of the disease. Pulmonary fibrosis was
found in later chest CT images in more than half of the pneumonia cases and should be taken
into account.
