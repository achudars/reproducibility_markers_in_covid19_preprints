Abstract
Recent anecdotal and scientific reports have provided evidence of a link between
COVID-19 and chemosensory impairments such as anosmia. However, these reports
have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored
chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, were mostly restricted to
data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial
results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and
quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and
chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire
launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a
COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly,
smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to
their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100)
revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± SD), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and
chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory
ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss.
Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore,
chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and
clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated
chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and
chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal
obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural
mechanisms.

Introduction
In late 2019, a new virus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
coronavirus strain 2), was reported in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020). The resulting
COVID-19 disease has become a global pandemic with 3.18 million reported cases as of
May 1, 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). When assessing SARS-CoV-2
infection, clinicians initially focused on symptoms such as fever, body aches, and dry
cough. However, emerging reports suggest sudden olfactory loss (anosmia or
hyposmia) may be prevalent in patients with COVID-19 (Menni et al., 2020; Vetter et al.,
2020). Olfactory disorders have long been associated with viral upper respiratory tract
infections (URI) that cause the common cold and flu, including influenza and
parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and other endemic coronaviruses (Soler et al.,
2020). Taste disorders have been known to occur during and after respiratory viral
infection, as well (Hummel et al., 2011). One case report found anosmia presenting with
SARS (Hwang, 2006). Olfactory dysfunction due to viral infections may account for 1145% of all olfactory disorders excluding presbyosmia (Nordin and Brömerson, 2008).
The estimated prevalence of COVID-19-associated olfactory impairment may be higher
than in COVID-19-independent postviral olfactory loss; estimations range from 5% to
85% in self-report studies, with differences noted between mild and severe cases
(Bagheri et al., 2020; Gane et al., 2020; Giacomelli et al., 2020; Haldrup et al., 2020;
Hopkins et al., 2020; Lechien et al., 2020a; 2020b; Mao et al., 2020; Menni et al., 2020;
Yan et al., 2020a; 2020b). When psychophysical odor identification tests are used, this
prevalence ranges from 76% in Europe using the Sniffin’ Sticks (Lechien et al., 2020b)

to 98% in Iran using the UPSIT (Moein et al., 2020), though the severity of COVID-19 in
these study cohorts may not be representative of the larger population. These
anecdotes, pre-prints, letters, and peer-reviewed reports (for a review see, Pellegrino et
al., in press), describe chemosensory disturbances in COVID-19 with characteristics that
are similar to those seen in common URIs, such as isolated sudden onset of anosmia
(Gane et al., 2020), occurrence of anosmia in mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19
(Hopkins et al., 2020), and loss of taste (Lechien et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020a). As of
May 13, 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the World
Health Organization and the following countries or regions have listed smell loss as a
symptom of COVID-19: Argentina, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg,
New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands,
and the United States of America (U.S.A.); many other countries or regions have not yet
officially acknowledged smell loss as a symptom of COVID-19. To date, quantitative
studies to determine the extent and detail of broad chemosensory changes in COVID-19
are rare, with the exception of two recent studies: Iravani et al. (2020), assessed odor
intensity in a group of Swedish respondents, while Moein et al. (2020) tested a small
sample of hospitalized Iranian patients with the University of Pennsylvania Smell
Identification Test. We use three separate sensory modalities – smell, taste and
chemesthesis – to sense our chemical environment in daily life. The olfactory system
(smell) detects volatile chemicals through olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal cavity.
Odors in the external environment are sampled through the nostrils (orthonasal
olfaction), while odors coming from food or drink in the mouth are sampled via the
nasopharynx (retronasal olfaction). The gustatory system (taste) responds to non-

volatile compounds in the mouth that elicit sensations of sweet, salty, bitter, sour and
umami (savory). Finally, chemesthesis detects other chemicals, often found in herbs or
spices, that evoke sensations like burning, cooling or tingling.
While taste has occasionally been explored with respect to COVID-19 (e.g.,
Giacomelli et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020), chemesthesis remains unexamined in recent
studies, despite anecdotal reports that it may be similarly compromised in persons with
COVID-19. Smell, taste, and chemesthesis are often conflated, mostly because they
produce a single experience of flavor during eating (Rozin, 1982; Spence et al., 2014;
Duffy and Hayes, 2019; Hayes, 2019), and patients often report a loss of taste when in
fact they are experiencing a loss of retronasal olfaction. Nevertheless, the olfactory and
gustatory systems, along with parts of the somatosensory system that conveys
chemesthesis, are separate sensory systems with distinct peripheral and central neural
mechanisms (Shepherd, 2006; Green, 2012). To date, the impact of COVID-19 on each
of these three chemosensory modalities remains poorly understood.
Chemosensory disturbances can result in quantitative reductions in smell or taste
(i.e., anosmia/hyposmia and ageusia/hypogeusia, respectively), or as qualitative
changes (e.g., distortions of smell and taste, termed parosmia and dysgeusia, or
phantom sensations, termed phantosmia and phantogeusia). These key distinctions
have been neglected in previous reports. Because these phenomena are not
necessarily correlated and have different mechanisms (Holbrook et al., 2005; Iannilli et
al., 2019; Reden et al., 2007), understanding how COVID-19 impacts chemosensation in

both quantitative and qualitative ways should provide important insights into the
mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the chemical senses.
Ideally, validated testing of chemosensory function would be combined with a
review of a patient’s medical records, including laboratory test results (from viral swab or
serology, “Lab Test”) to confirm the infectious agent. Due to limited laboratory test
availability in many countries, the necessity in some medical settings for social
distancing, and a potentially large number of asymptomatic or mild cases, it has been
impractical or impossible to conduct such chemosensory testing for many individuals
with COVID-19. Additionally, in many countries where testing resources are limited,
laboratory testing has been limited to the most severe cases. Another diagnosis method
is a clinical assessment by a medical professional (“Clinical Assessment”), either inoffice or remotely via tele-medicine. Thus, the method of diagnosis – Lab Test versus
Clinical Assessment – may be associated with differences in symptom severity,
including severity of chemosensory impairments. To account for possible differences in
the severity of infection as well as the availability of diagnosis options across countries,
we collected information on diagnosis methods and compared chemosensory function
between participants diagnosed with Lab Test vs. Clinical Assessment.
Given all the issues raised above, we deployed a crowd-sourced, multilingual,
online study with a global reach (as of May 1, 2020 deployed in 27 languages); this
survey has the potential to provide reproducible data from a large number of participants
around the world. In this pre-registered report, we present data from 4039 participants
who reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via Lab Test or Clinical Assessment and who

completed the questionnaire during the first 11 days the study was available online.
Here we address two main research questions. First, we asked what chemosensory
changes are observed in participants with COVID-19, compared to before illness (i.e.,
within participants). Next, we asked whether the two diagnostic groups differ in
chemosensory changes (i.e., between participants). For both diagnosis methods, we
observed significant quantitative changes in smell, taste, and chemesthesis with COVID19. Most chemosensory loss could not be accounted for by self-reported nasal
obstruction, a factor commonly associated with diminished smell in other upper
respiratory diseases (Doty, 2001). Further, we found little incidence of qualitative
changes in olfactory function, with only a small percentage of participants reporting
distorted smells (consistent with parosmia) or phantom smells (consistent with
phantosmia). Together, these results provide an initial assessment of comprehensive
chemosensory impairments associated with COVID-19.

Method
Preregistration
We preregistered our hypotheses and analyses on April 19, 2020, at 12:20 AM
Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), before the data became available (data reflected
questionnaires submitted between April 7, 2020 6:00AM EDT and April 18, 2020 at 8:34
AM EDT) (Veldhuizen et al., 2020). In line with the pre-registration, and according to the
Sequential Bayes Factor Design (section 2.3), one of the authors (AJB) not involved in
the development of the pre-registration queried the database to check whether the

minimum number of participants per group was reached. The data reported in this
manuscript, along with analysis scripts, will be available at OSF (https://osf.io/a3vkw/)
upon the acceptance of the manuscript. The project is structured according to the
research compendium created with the rrtools package (Marwick, 2019). The presented
analyses are as pre-registered, unless specified otherwise.
The GCCR core questionnaire
The GCCR questionnaire [Supplementary Materials, and included in the list of research
tools to assess COVID-19 by the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences
Research (OBSSR, Anonymous, 2020)], measures self-reported smell, taste, and
chemesthesis function as well as nasal blockage in participants with respiratory illness,
including COVID-19, within the two weeks prior to completing the questionnaire. It was
created iteratively through a crowdsourced approach with a preliminary period of
development and commentary across an international group of chemosensory experts,
clinicians and patients advocates. Relevant to the scope of the present manuscript,
participants were asked to quantify their ability to smell, taste, and perceive cooling,
tingling and burning sensations (chemesthesis) before and during the COVID-19, on
separate, horizontally-presented, 100-point visual analogue scales (VAS). Participants
were also asked to quantify their perceived nasal obstruction on a 100-point VAS with
“not at all blocked” and “completely blocked” as anchors. Framing the questions in terms
of ability, rather than intensity, was driven by the desire to be readily understood by
participants without additional training or instructions and was informed by spontaneous
patient reports, internet search trends and in dialogue with patient advocates (e.g., we

implicitly separated taste / chemesthesis experienced in the mouth from orthonasal
smell as experienced in the nose, in full alignment with the ecological framework first
proposed by Gibson in 1966. Specifically, for taste, we stated “The following questions
are related to your sense of taste. For example, sweetness, sourness, saltiness,
bitterness experienced in the mouth.” For chemesthesis, we stated “The following
questions are related to other sensations in your mouth, like burning, cooling, or tingling.
For example, chili peppers, mint gum or candy, or carbonation. In both cases, we were
orienting participants toward sensations that are experienced in the mouth. In contrast,
for smell, we stated “These questions relate to your sense of smell (for example, sniffing
flowers or soap, or smelling garbage) but not the flavor of food in your mouth.” The
within-subject nature of the present design precludes a need for more sophisticated
scaling methods than VAS (Kalva et al., 2014). Although participants were not randomly
assigned to the two diagnostic groups, the groups may be considered as if random when
it comes to adjective interpretation / scale usage, thereby within Bartoshuk’s arguments
for using a VAS across group comparisons (Bartoshuk et al., 2003). Please refer to
Figure S2 for a list of the questions analyzed in the present work.
Participants were also asked to report demographic information (i.e., year of birth,
gender, and country of residence) as well as information related to their COVID-19
diagnosis and their respiratory illness-related symptoms, including smell and taste, in
check-all-that-apply (CATA) format. We summarized the questions used in the present
study in Supplementary Figure S1. Please refer to the full questionnaire, included in the
Supplementary materials, for question order and the labels on the anchors of each
question.

The questionnaire was implemented in 10 languages as of April 18th, 2020 (the
date on which the database was last queried for this report): English, French, German,
Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. Our translation
protocol was modeled after the process developed by the Psychological Science
Accelerator (Moshontz et al., 2018). Briefly, translations of the original English
questionnaire involved three steps: i) the original (English) questionnaire was translated
to the target language by independent translators, resulting in Translation Version A; ii)
Version A was translated back from the target language to English by a separate group

among all translators, with the goal of resolving potential discrepancies between the two
versions, resulting in the final Version C. All questionnaires in all languages were then
implemented in Compusense Cloud, Academic Consortium (Guelph, Ontario), a secure
cloud-based data collection platform with multilingual support. Please refer to the
supplementary materials for the full survey (Supplementary Materials) and to the
questions from the survey analyzed in the present work (Figure S1).
Study design
This study compares self-reported quantitative changes (during vs. before the
illness) in smell, taste, chemesthesis, and nasal obstruction as well as qualitative
changes in smell and taste between two groups of respondents: those who reported a
COVID-19 diagnosis as a result of an objective test such as a swab test (“Lab Test”) or
those who reported a diagnosis from clinical observations by a medical professional
(“Clinical Assessment”). Given the lack of effect size estimates in the literature, we

employed a Sequential Bayes Factor Design (SBFD) that allows optional stopping with
unlimited multiple testing (Schönbrodt et al., 2017). Specifically, we used a SBFD with a
minimal number of participants and a temporal stopping rule to increase the probability
of obtaining the desired level of evidence and to reduce the probability of obtaining
misleading evidence. The desired grade of relative evidence for the alternative vs. the
null (BF10) hypothesis is set at BF10 > 10 (strong evidence) for H1 and BF01 > 6
(moderate evidence) for H0. We derived the minimal Nmin = 480 per group to start SBFD
through a Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) for fixed-n designs (Schönbrodt and
Wagenmakers, 2018) for a two-independent-sample, two-sided testing, and a
conservative Cohen’s D = 0.2 with 80% power of reaching a BF10 > 10 and a BF01 > 6
with a default prior. Our stopping rule follows a temporal criterion (data collection until
April 18, 2020, 8:34 AM EDT) and Nmin. BF computation continues with every 20
participants added in the slowest accumulating group at a time until the thresholds of H1
or H0 are reached.
Study setting
Participation in this online study was voluntary and participants received no
remuneration. Inclusion criteria were: consent to participate, age 19 years and older
(based on birth year), and any form or suspicion of respiratory illness in the past two
weeks. Participants were asked about their year of birth and the onset of their illness
during the survey to confirm the inclusion criteria, and the survey terminated for noneligible participants via branching logic. The nature of the questionnaire necessitated at
least some secondary education in terms of language and distribution method (web

survey) as well as internet access. The protocol complies with the revised Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved as an exempt study by the Office of Research Protections at
The Pennsylvania Study University (Penn State) in the U.S.A. (STUDY00014904). The
questionnaire was distributed globally in the different languages through traditional (i.e.,
print, television, radio) and social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), the website of the
Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR; https://gcchemosensr.org),
flyers, professional networks, and word of mouth. All data were collected from a nonrepresentative, convenience sample via Compusense Cloud, which is compatible with
use on a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Data collection was compliant
with privacy laws in the U.S.A. and the European Union [including California and
General Data Protection regulation (GDPR) rules].
Participants
At the close of data collection on April 18, 2020, 4039 participants with a diagnosis of
COVID-19 completed the ratings for smell, taste, chemesthesis ability, and nasal
obstruction before and during their recent illness and were included in the present study.
Participants who did not complete all ratings as mentioned above and/or gave
inconsistent responses in three questions that addressed changes in smell perception
(specifically, selecting changes in smell in “Have you had any of the following symptoms
with your recent respiratory illness or diagnosis?”, reporting a difference of at least 5
points in “Rate your ability to smell before your recent respiratory illness or diagnosis”
and/or select at least one answer at the question “Have you experienced any of the
following changes in smell with your recent respiratory illness diagnosis?”) or reported

sample, 2913 were women, 1118 were men, 3 were other and 5 preferred not to say.
Overall the age of the participants ranged from 19 to 79 years old (mean ± sd: 41.38 ±
12.20 years old).
Here, we will compare respondents from two diagnostic groups: (a) participants
who reported that their COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed via objective Lab Test (N =
1402: 1064 F, 335 M; age mean ± sd: 40.73 ± 12.29 years old) compared with (b)
participants who reported that their COVID-19 diagnosis was obtained via clinical
observation by a medical professional (N = 2637: 1849 F, 783 M; age mean ± sd: 41.72
± 12.14 years old). Based on self-report, respondents indicated they resided in the
following countries: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany,
Greece, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Morocco, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Paraguay, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, UK, United Arab Emirates,
U.S.A. Figure 1 illustrates the derivation of the sample presented here.

To test our hypotheses (H0: no difference between groups; H1: difference between
groups) in this between-participant SBFD, we conducted a Bayesian linear regression
with the lmBF function from the BayesFactor package (Morey and Rouder, 2018) to
detect changes (during minus before COVID-19) in smell, taste and chemesthetic
abilities as well as nasal obstruction. Data report the Bayes factor and no proportional
error estimate on the Bayes factor since they were all lower than 2.07e-05. We used the
default Cauchy prior on the effect sizes under the H1 as the scale parameter spread
which was set at its default value of r = sqrt(2)/2. We performed robustness (sensitivity)
checks by adjusting the Cauchy distribution to r = 0.5 and r = 1 to assess how the choice
of prior affects the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We first assessed whether the
model provides evidence in favor of H1 or H0. To interpret the strength and the direction
of those effects, we sampled from the models’ posterior distributions (iterations = 1e4).
Please refer to the pre-registration and the analysis script (see above) for further details.
As reported in Table 1, the interpretation of the Bayes factors BF10 follows the
classification scheme proposed by Lee and Wagenmakers (2013) and adjusted from
(Jeffreys, 1961).

Exploratory non-preregistered analyses
To quantify the association between the reports of (a) parosmia and phantosmia,
(b) smell, (c) taste, (d) chemesthesis, and (e) a change in perceived nasal obstruction,
we computed a correlation matrix that is visualized with ggstatsplot (Patil and Powell,
2018). To assess whether the proportion of parosmia and phantosmia reports differs
between groups, we used a two-sample test for equality of proportions with a continuity
correction. To characterize the relationship between perceived nasal blockage and
chemosensory change, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) using prcomp
from the R default stats package and we plotted the results with functions from the
FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008). Additionally, to test whether different
chemosensory function profiles exist in our sample, we performed a cluster analysis.

The best clustering scheme was with 3 clusters as determined with NbCluster (Charrad
et al., 2014), which tests 30 methods that vary the combinations of number of clusters
and distance measures for the k-means clustering. Cluster stability was estimated
through a bootstrapping approach (100 iterations) with the bootcluster package (Yu,
2017).

Results
Degree of smell loss during COVID-19
Overall, participants reported a large reduction in the sense of smell (-79.7 ±
28.7 points on the 100-point scale; mean ± sd). Such decrease in the ability to smell was
confirmed with extreme evidence (smell change against zero: BF10 = 4366.29 ± 0%) and
that was similar for both groups (BF10 = 2.17 ± 0% inconclusive evidence for a group
difference, i.e. H1; Figure 2A). The Clinical Assessment group exhibited a larger
variance in the ability to smell during the illness as compared to the Lab Test group
(Levene test, F(1,4037) = 6.81, p = 0.009; see also the box plots in Figure 2A).

ratings. COVID-19 diagnosis is coded such that Clinical Assessment is a lighter shade
and Lab Test is a darker shade.
Smell qualitative changes
Parosmia did not differ significantly between groups (X2(1) = 0.54, p = 0.463 [-0.01
⁠– 0.03]) and was reported by 7.77% (205 out of 2637) of participants in the Clinical
Assessment and in 7.13% (100 out of 1402) the Lab Test group. Reports of phantosmia,
however, did significantly differ between groups (X2(1) = 13.8, p < 0.001 [0.02 ⁠– 0.06]): it
was reported by 9.44% (249 out of 2637) of participants in the Clinical Assessment and
in 6.28% (88 out of 1402) the Lab Test group. Reports of either parosmia or phantosmia
negatively correlated with a report of a reduced ability to smell (on VAS) or a total smell
loss (reported via CATA). Parosmia and phantosmia positively correlated with changes
in smell, taste, and chemesthesis ratings but not with changes in perceived nasal
obstruction (Figure 3).

Degree of taste loss in COVID-19
Similar to what was seen with smell loss, we observed an overall reduced ability
to taste (-69.0 ± 32.6 points; mean ± sd) that was confirmed with extreme evidence
(taste change against zero: BF10 = 3424.52 ± 0%) and that was similar for both groups
(BF10 = 0.72 ± 0% suggesting inconclusive evidence for a group difference). The Clinical
Assessment group exhibited a larger variance in the ability to taste during COVID-19 as
compared to the Lab Test group (Levene test: F(1,4037) = 3.91, p = 0.048; see also the
box plots in Figure 2B).
Taste quality-specific changes
Participants were given the option to report changes in specific taste qualities (i.e.,
salty, sour, sweet, bitter or umami/savory) as a CATA question. Of all participants, 40%
in both groups did not respond, 11% in both groups reported impairment of a single taste
quality, and 48% reported impairment of two or more taste qualities (48% in the Clinical
Assessment group, 49% in the Lab Test group). Between groups, only umami (savory)
taste change was less frequently reported (25%) in the Clinical Assessment group than
in the Lab Test group (29%; X2(1) = 7.22, p < 0.007 [-0.07 ⁠– -0.01]). No significant
differences in the frequency of reporting changes for sweet, salty, bitter or sour taste
was evident between groups (Table 3).

Degree of chemesthesis loss in COVID-19
Similar to taste and smell, we observed an overall loss of chemesthetic ability (37.3 ± 36.2; mean ± sd) that was confirmed with extreme evidence (chemesthetic
change against zero: BF10 = 1459.98 ± 0%) and that was similar for both groups (BF01 =
35.42 ± 0% suggesting strong evidence against a group difference, Figure 2C). The
distribution of chemesthetic ability showed a large 95%-CI [-2.82 ⁠– 1.88].
Perceived nasal obstruction in COVID-19
We observed a disease-related change in perceived nasal obstruction that was
supported by extreme evidence (nasal obstruction change against zero: BF10 = 783.25 ±
0%). No difference in the change in perceived nasal obstruction was found between
groups as corroborated by moderate evidence against a group difference (BF01 = 14.52
± 0%; Figure 4A).

To further characterize potential relationships between changes in perceived
nasal obstruction and reports of changes in the three chemosensory modalities, we
computed a Principal Component Analysis (Figure 4B). Changes in smell, taste, and
chemesthesis ratings (during minus before) correlated strongly with component 1 (smell:
r = 0.72; taste: r = 0.84; chemesthesis: r = 0.74), which explained 45.2% of the total
multidimensional variance (inertia). By contrast, change in perceived nasal obstruction
was strongly anti-correlated (r = -0.97) with the orthogonal component 2, which explains
24.6% of the total inertia. These results indicate statistical independence of changes in
chemosensory ability and perceived nasal obstruction. That is, changes in
chemosensory ability and perceived nasal obstruction are statistically independent, so
we conclude that changes in olfactory function in COVID-19 positive individuals cannot
be attributed to nasal obstruction.

Chemosensory clustering
Overall, distinct patterns of chemosensory dysfunction/distortion existed among
the study participants. We used k-means algorithm to cluster respondents based on the
similarities and differences in smell, taste, and chemesthesis change (Figure 5). The
data-driven, 3-cluster solution (bootstrapped stability = 0.94) identified three groups that
can be described by a combination of two chemosensory dimensions: i) the degree of
smell and taste loss and ii) the degree of chemesthesis loss. Cluster 1 (N = 1767, blue)

chemesthesis (centroids: smell: -87.81, taste: -65.97, chemesthesis: -11.07). Cluster 2

unaffected chemesthesis (centroids: smell: -24.33, taste: -20.97, chemesthesis: -6.87).
Cluster 3 (N = 548, green) is characterized by ratings reflecting substantial smell, taste,
and chemesthesis loss (centroids: smell: -88.89, taste: -86.74, chemesthesis: -72.39).

Discussion
Our study confirms and substantially extends previous reports showing that smell
loss and taste loss are associated with COVID-19. Similar to other recent studies
(Bagheri et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Gane et al., 2020; Giacomelli et al., 2020;
Haldrup et al., 2020; Hopkins et al., 2020; Lechien et al., 2020a, 2020b; Mao et al.,
2020; Menni et al., 2020; Moein et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020a, 2020b), we find that the
majority of our participants with COVID-19 reports a severe reduction in the ability to
smell as compared to before the onset of that disease. Notably, this smell loss was not
associated with self-reported nasal obstruction, consistent with anecdotal reports.
Further, we find that qualitative changes in smell (smell distortions or phantoms) were
relatively rare. We found that taste, and to a lesser degree chemesthesis, were also
significantly impaired for individuals with COVID-19. Together, these results suggest that
COVID-19 broadly impacts chemosensory function across multiple sensory modalities,
and that disruption of these may be a possible indicator of COVID-19.
This project is distinct from prior studies on the links between chemosensory
dysfunction and COVID-19 in that it leverages a massive crowd-sourced, multinational
approach to attack this urgent issue, and does so within a collaborative open science
framework. This initial report is based on data in 10 languages from 41 countries; since
the first tranche of data on April 18, 2020, 18 additional languages have been added on
a rolling basis. The multinational, collaborative nature of the GCCR approach also sets it
apart from other recently developed tools. Our hope is that an inclusive globally
deployed assessment, coupled with publicly accessible data shared under contemporary

open science best practices, will serve as a foundation for future work. It is a limitation of
this initial snapshot, however, that participants from different countries are not evenly
represented. Cultural biases or country-specific manifestations of COVID-19 could
potentially impact these results and will be explored by GCCR in future studies. Though
our comprehensive self-report survey cannot replace in-person testing in a controlled
clinical or laboratory setting, the gold standard for assessing alterations in
chemosensory function, it efficiently and effectively addresses an emerging public health
crisis with global scope of coverage. Thus, the model shown in this study of remote
smell and taste assessment utilizing the internet may represent one way of reducing
delays in assessment until aggressive physical distancing ends (Patel, 2020; Workman
et al., 2020).
The mean change in ability to smell was substantial. Prior to onset of COVID-19,
the mean rating for the ability to smell was over 90 on a 100-point VAS, yet during the
disease, the mean rating dropped below 20. These data do not allow us to differentiate
between individuals with partial (hyposmia) versus total loss (anosmia), and participants
themselves may be unable to precisely characterize their degree of loss in the absence
of objective olfactory testing (Hoffman et al., 2016; Loetsch and Hummel, 2019; WelgeLüssen et al., 2005). Still, we can conservatively conclude that a major drop in the ability
to smell is a hallmark of COVID-19. If the prevalence of COVID-19-associated smell loss
is greater than that reported for the common cold or influenza (Beltrán-Corbellini et al.,
2020), a different mechanism for disrupting olfactory function may be at play, or this

difference could also reflect increased tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for olfactory tissues (Baig
et al., 2020).
Critically, the self-reported smell loss we observed is statistically independent of
self-reported nasal obstruction. In common URIs, nasal obstruction can explain
temporary smell impairments, a phenomenon many individuals have experienced in
daily life. Here, estimates of nasal obstruction were based solely on self-report (we
asked participants to rate the amount of “nasal blockage”); our data do not include
objective, clinically validated measures of nasal breathing or obstruction. While nasal
congestion does occur with COVID-19, it appears to be relatively rare in our sample.
Still, the fact that many of our participants report substantial loss of olfactory function in
the absence of concomitant nasal blockage seems remarkable.
In other instances of post-viral smell loss, about half of patients also experience a
qualitative change in smell (Frasnelli et al., 2004; Reden et al., 2007; Rombaux et al.,
2009). By contrast, less than 10% of participants in this study reported parosmia or
phantosmia symptoms. The rarity of qualitative changes in smell may be a hallmark of
COVID-19-

associated smell impairments. Alternatively, the present study may not

have fully captured qualitative changes in smell, as they tend to emerge later in the
course of other disorders (Bonfils et al., 2005) and the present assessment was limited
to within at most two weeks of suspected illness or diagnosis. Further studies are
needed to more comprehensively address this issue.
While taste loss has also been associated with COVID-19 in patient anecdotes and a
few studies, in most cases it has not been clearly differentiated from changes in smell.

Here, we found that ratings of taste function were, like those for smell, substantially
decreased in individuals with COVID-19. Participant ratings for taste function dropped
from a mean of ~ 91 before COVID-19 onset to less than ~24 during the disease. It is
well established that people often confuse changes in retronasal olfaction – an important
component of flavor perception during eating and drinking – with a true taste loss. While
we cannot rule this out completely given the study design, ~60% of those reporting a
taste loss also reported a decrease in their perception of at least one specific taste
quality, with salty taste being the most common selection. The question on taste
qualities is a CATA (check all that apply) question, which means that the subjects can
choose any taste qualities that they believe were clearly affected. Indeed, many of the
participants chose multiple taste qualities. These data support an interpretation that at
least some participants were properly discerning taste from flavor. The observation that
some participants reported loss of only a subset of taste qualities may reflect their
difficulty in correctly identifying and naming individual taste qualities (Pilkova et al., 1991;
Welge-Luessen et al., 2011) rather than quality-selective hypogeusia/ageusia (e.g.,
Gudziol and Hummel, 2007; Henkin et al., 1970; Lugaz et al., 2002; Huque et al., 2009).
However, these possibilities cannot be clarified with the present database.
Compared to smell, the literature has described fewer examples of post-viral taste
loss (Adour, 1994; Rubin and Daube, 1999). As the number of people responding to this
questionnaire continues to grow on a rolling basis, the differences among different types
of respiratory illnesses and their relationship to the degree of taste loss will be a major
focus of forthcoming analyses.

Perhaps our most surprising finding was a notable loss of oral chemesthesis
ability with COVID-19. Though the decrease is not as large as seen for smell and taste –
an ~46% rating reduction for chemesthesis as compared to ~89% and ~76% percentage
drop in smell and taste, respectively – it is significant. Interestingly, impairment of
chemesthesis was typically accompanied by either taste and smell loss, while taste and
smell loss could appear with normal chemesthesis. While nasal chemesthesis
experienced with the inhalation of noxious chemicals like ammonia or ethanol is
sometimes confused with smell, oral chemesthesis responses to compounds like
capsaicin from chili peppers or menthol from mint rarely is (Green, 1996). Though
predominantly thought of as the chemical activation of trigeminal afferents carrying
temperature, pain or vibration information from the oral, nasal and eye mucosa, other
somatosensory nerves, including in the mouth, can also be affected (Green, 1996;
McDonald et al., 2016). Chemesthesis (and taste) has been reported to accompany
post-viral hyposmia resulting from a URI, at least in some cases (Ren et al., 2012; de
Haro-Licer et al., 2013; Pellegrino et al., 2017; Fark and Hummel, 2013). Together with
our findings for smell and taste, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 impacts all three
major chemosensory modalities. The mechanisms are not clear and may be distinct for
each chemosensory system. For example, transcriptomic studies of the olfactory
mucosa of mouse and human suggests that sustentacular, Bowman’s gland,
microvillous cells and stem cell populations, not olfactory sensory neurons themselves,
contain ACE2, a receptor required for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells. (Brann et al.,
2020; Fodoulian et al., 2020). The pattern of ACE2 expression indicates SARS-CoV-2
may infect tongue keratinocytes (Venkatakrishnan et al., 2020) but it is not known if taste

receptor cells or cranial nerves carrying taste or chemesthetic information can be
infected by SARS-CoV-2. This virus could alternatively infect surrounding epithelia or
blood vessels (Sungnak et al., 2020; Varga et al., 2020), or perhaps even target cells of
the central nervous system (Baig et al., 2020).
Based on the stark changes in ratings reported here, one may speculate that both
smell and taste loss in COVID-19 are all-or-none phenomena. Although, we cannot rule
out that this is an artifact of scale usage, this explanation seems unlikely, as the
distribution of the chemesthetic ability ratings is roughly rectangular. This suggests that
the all-or-none effect observed for smell cannot be simply attributed to participants using
the scale in a discrete rather than continuous fashion. The self-reporting of olfactory
function has been used in numerous studies; however, it is not unanimously accepted as
it may suffer from low validity (Landis et al., 2003) due to under- and overreporting
biases (Dalton and Hummel, 2000; Oleszkiewicz et al., 2020) and possible arbitrary
usage. These studies all indicate that self-report ratings are far from being completely
inaccurate, especially in participants with severe hyposmia or anosmia, with reported
accuracy rates of 70-80% (Lötsch et al., 2019, Hoffman et al., 2016; Rawal et al., 2015).
Here, we account for well-known individual differences in baseline chemosensory
abilities, as well as use of rating scales, by using a within-subject design where
participants rate their abilities for different time points (before and during COVID-19). We
perform an analysis of differences between two assessments (e.g. during minus before
COVID-19) rather than on absolute ratings. To better address the question of validity of
change in ability ratings, future studies should compare these self-reported and recalled

ratings to validated clinical tests before and during the individual’s respiratory illness.
However, in times of pandemic, the advantages of a remote assessment method may
outweigh the potential decrease in validity compared to face-to-face clinical measures of
taste and smell. Still, we acknowledge that a convenience sample recruited online may
not be representative of the general population; thus, our study and others that use this
type of recruitment approach (e.g., Menni et al., 2020; Iravani et al., 2020) should not be
used to estimate prevalence of chemosensory loss in individuals with COVID-19.
Lastly, we found that mean impairments of smell, taste, and or chemesthesis did
not differ between study participants who reported a COVID-19 diagnosis based on a
Lab Test and those who reported diagnosis based on a Clinical Assessment. However,
the Clinical Assessment group exhibited a larger variance in chemosensory loss than
the Lab Test group. This could reflect more variability in the accuracy of the diagnosis,
as the Clinical Assessment group may include individuals who were misdiagnosed and
actually have another viral illness and/or a milder form of the disease. Determining
whether the degree of change in chemosensory ability differs between COVID-19positive individuals and those who are COVID-19-negative but have another respiratory
disease will require specific comparisons between those two groups in a future study.

Conclusions

advocates, and scientists can work together to undertake large-scale ground-breaking
research of acute public health significance. The present research sets an example of

how an emergent response to a global pandemic can be tackled with a crowd-sourced
initiative that combines rigorous scientific standards with open-science practices. The
established network, research infrastructure, protocol, and findings have the potential to
influence current theories on the effects and mechanisms of COVID-19 on the chemical
senses and to fuel future research in other areas.
