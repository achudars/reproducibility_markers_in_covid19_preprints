Abstract
Background
Since March 2020, the United States has lost over 200,000 lives to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. A growing body of literature
describes population-level SARS-CoV-2 exposure, but studies of antibody seroprevalence
within school systems are critically lacking, hampering evidence-based discussions on school
reopenings. The Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system in suburban
Indiana, USA, assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in its staff and identified correlations
between seropositivity and subjective histories and demographics.
Methods
This study is a cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 in LCSC staff measured in July 2020. ​We tested for seroprevalence with the
Abbott ​Alinity™​ SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. The primary outcome was the total
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, and secondary outcomes included trends of antibody presence
in relation to baseline attributes.
Findings
753 participants representative of the staff at large were enrolled. 22 participants (2·9%, 95%
CI: 1·8% - 4·4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Correcting for test performance
parameters, the seroprevalence is estimated at 1·7% (90% Credible Interval: 0·27% - 3·3%).
Multivariable logistic regression including mask wearing, travel history, symptom history, and
contact history revealed a 48-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity if an individual previously
tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 48.2, 95% CI: 4 - 600). Amongst individuals with no previous
positive test, exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 increased the odds of
seropositivity by 7-fold (OR: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.06 - 18.9).
Interpretation
Assuming the presence of antibodies is associated with immunity against SARS-CoV-2
infection, these results demonstrate a broad lack of herd immunity amongst the school
corporation’s staff irrespective of employment role or location. Protective measures like contact
tracing face coverings, and social distancing are therefore vital to maintaining the safety of both
students and staff as the school year progresses.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, SSRN, Research Square, and Gale Power Search for peer-reviewed
articles, preprints, and research reports on the seroprevalence of anti-severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies, published in English, using the search
terms “COVID-19 in schools,” “COVID-19 seroprevalence,” “COVID antibodies,” and similar
terms up to August 30, 2020. We identified several articles pertaining to the spread of
COVID-19 within schools and among children. Current evidence on the pediatric transmission of
COVID-19 is mixed, but early data on secondary school transmission are sobering. Shared
among this literature was an acknowledgement of the paucity of data regarding how the
pandemic may progress in the students and staff of primary and secondary education systems.
To our knowledge, there is no study that specifically interrogates the seroprevalence of
COVID-19 among US public school staff.
Added value of this study
As of September 2020, the United States has had more COVID-19 cases than any other
country. With many US schools opening for in-person classes for the 2020-2021 school year, a
granular understanding of the transmission dynamics within public school systems is vital to
effectively and appropriately defending against COVID-19. Most seroprevalence studies have
been based on city or hospital-level populations; this study establishes a baseline
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a Midwest public school district prior to the
initiation of the school year.
Implications of all available evidence
The results of this study reveal that the majority (98·3%) of LCSC staff have not been exposed
to COVID-19 prior to the start of the school year. Staff are therefore vulnerable to a large
outbreak after the school opens, underscoring the importance of maintaining rigorous sanitary
practices within the schools. It is vital that all members of LCSC and similar school districts
across the country continue social distancing and mask wearing throughout the school day to
limit exposure to COVID-19. Contact tracing in combination with rapid testing for individuals
exposed to an individual with COVID-19 should also be employed.

Background
Over 970,000 people around the world have lost their lives from severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19) as of September 2020. The United States
alone has reported 200,000 deaths.​1​ A critical bottleneck in containing the virus is
understanding its transmission dynamics. Although much effort has been expended on
population-level seroprevalence surveys, scant data exist to understand COVID-19’s potential
effect on the US public school system’s students and staff. Existing data are sobering: ten days
into its reopening, an Israeli high school experienced a major outbreak.​2​ Work on the pediatric
transmission of COVID-19 are conflicting; in multiple studies conducted in Southwest Germany,
Ireland, and Northern France, children under 10 were found to have had little effect on the
spread of the virus, while a study in Chile claimed that elementary students were more likely to
contract the virus relative to secondary students.​3,4,5,6​ Here, we determine the seroprevalence of
COVID-19 in the Lake Central School Corporation (LCSC), a public school system located in
suburban Indiana, US. Although there is enormous heterogeneity within the US public school
system, LCSC staff’s demographics are broadly representative of national statistics. The LCSC
has 16·6 students per teacher, similar to the United States average of 16 students per
teacher.​7,8​ The median age of public school employees in the United States is 41, while the
median age of the Lake Central employee population lies at 48.​9,10​ Notably, previous reports
have established that advanced age is highly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, further
underscoring the threat of morbidity and mortality within this community relative to other school
districts.​11​ Given the lack of specificity of COVID-19 symptoms and that mild and asymptomatic
cases of COVID-19 may go undocumented, antibody-based seroprevalance studies are
required to estimate population-level exposure to SARS-CoV-2, although it should be noted that
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 via such antibodies has yet to be firmly established.​12
Methods
Study design and participants
This cross-sectional, population-based analysis of the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
enrolled participants over a five day period in July of 2020 during participation in the LCSC’s
annual wellness check. Individuals were eligible to participate if they were 18 years of age or
older and were employees of the Lake Central school corporation during the 2018-2019 or
2019-2020 school years.
After approval from the Community Healthcare System Central Institutional Review Board (CHS
CIRB #07-02), participants were contacted through their respective LCSC email account as well
as by voice message from the LCSC superintendent informing them of the opportunity to
participate. These communications provided information regarding the study and a link in the
email allowed participants to schedule their testing date. A second email containing a video
promoting the study was sent to staff and shared on LCSC social media accounts. There was
no cost to participate in testing. Once registered, each participant completed a data
questionnaire containing questions about sociodemographic characteristics including
self-identified gender, employment factors, and activities that can increase the risk of having
COVID-19, as well as informed written consent (Supplementary Materials).

During the five days of data collection, the study team was present at the testing site to assist
with distributing additional consent forms and data questionnaires. Participants were required to
wear a mask upon entering the building and hand sanitizer was available at each station.
Stations were six feet apart, and a member of the LCSC staff used cleaning wipes to disinfect
each station between participants. An independent third party vendor, Franciscan WorkingWell,
performed venipuncture using standard procedure for the antibody tests, and obtained a 5 mL
blood sample for the antibody test and a 6 mL blood sample for blood typing.
The primary outcome was the total seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies within
staff. The secondary outcomes were the changes in odds of seropositivity associated with
baseline demographics and COVID-19 related factors including mask use, contact history,
self-reported exposure to a known COVID-19 positive person or persons, and a previous
positive COVID-19 test (PCR or antibody-based) (Supplementary Materials).
Laboratory analysis
Seroprevalence was determined utilizing the commercially available Abbott Alinity™
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test, with a reported 100% sensitivity (34/34, 95% CI: 89·7%-100%)
and 99% specificity (99/100, 95% CI: 94·5%-100%) in detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies.​13​ This test provides a binary, present/not present result.
Statistical analysis
Seroprevalence among LCSC staff was calculated as the proportion of staff members who
received a positive antibody test out of the total staff tested. Confidence intervals were first
estimated by generating a binomial confidence interval with the statsmodel package in Python
v3.7. The seroprevalence was then corrected for uncertainties in the test sensitivity and
specificity using previously established statistical approaches.​14​ Relative risks (risk ratios) were
calculated to identify associations between seropositivity and gender, BMI, blood type, contact
history, symptom history, travel history, role in school corporation, school where employed,
extracurricular role (coach, club sponsor), mask history, previous positive COVID-19 test, and
age on 7/20/20, the last day of sample collection. Employment role was separated into two
groups: those departments that worked in the school during the Indiana stay-at-home order
(maintenance, technology, and administration) and those that did not (all others). Continuous
variables (BMI, age) were binarized by segmenting the variable by its median value. Bonferroni
correction was used to correct for multiple testing on the univariate analyses. To determine if
having a history of mask-wearing reduced seropositivity, we constructed a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) based on existing literature evidence and identified gender, age, travel history,
school type, and role at LCSC as potential confounders to control for in the multivariable logistic
regression (Supplementary Figure 1).​6,15​ Finally, backward-stepwise feature elimination was
used to identify the features most predictive of seropositivity in a multivariable logistic regression
starting with the thirteen categories queried in the survey (threshold ​p​-value of 0·05). After the
model was identified for which all factors were statistically significant, three factors (mask

history, travel history, and symptom history) which are understood based on external studies to
have an impact on infectivity were reintroduced to this reduced model.​13,14,15
One factor, having a previous positive COVID-19 test in four individuals, was overwhelmingly
predictive for seropositivity. The regression was then re-fitted on the vast majority of individuals
without a previous positive test to estimate associations of features with seropositivity within this
group. For continuous variables such as age and BMI, missing data were either removed
(univariate analyses) or replaced with the median of existing data for that variable (multivariable
analysis). Missing data for categorical variables were either removed (univariate analyses) or
replaced with the mode of that variable (multivariable analysis). Logistic regressions were
calculated using the scikit-learn Python package.
Role of funding source
The funder, LCSC, had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of the report.
Results
Of the eligible 1261 staff members, 753 (60%) participated in the study. The LCSC staff
comprises 1060 (84%) women; the participation group had 635 (85%) women; age
demographics for the study population compared to that of the total staff were similarly
representative (Table 1).

In the univariate analyses, having a previous positive COVID-19 test (RR 29·5, 95% CI: 14·3 60·4, p<0·0001) or contact with a COVID-19 case (RR 6·86, 95% CI: 3·04 - 15·5), p<0·0001)
were found to be statistically significantly associated with seropositivity, after Bonferroni
correction (Table 2). No causal relationship between self-reported mask-wearing history and
seropositivity could be identified, after controlling for six confounders available in our data set,
identified using a directed acyclic graph (Supplementary Table 1) (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.18 - 3.8).
In the multivariable model employing backward-stepwise feature elimination, a previous positive
COVID-19 test (OR 48·2, 95% CI 3.9 - 597, p=0·003) or contact with a COVID-19 case (OR 5·6,
95% CI 2.1 - 15.1, p=0·001) were found to be the most predictive factors for seropositivity
(Supplementary Table 2). To interrogate the specific interaction between contact history and
seropositivity, the dataset was subsetted to the vast majority of individuals without a previous
positive COVID-19 test (n=749). In this population, a logistic regression analysis including the
predictors mask wearing, travel history, and symptom history, a positive contact history
conferred a 7-fold increase in the odds of seropositivity (p<0·0001) (Table 3). The odds
increased from 1:40 without such a contact to 1:5.5 with contact - or the probability of
seropositivity increased from 2.5% to 15%.

Discussion
This study provides the necessary baseline for future longitudinal monitoring to assess the
impact of public school reopening on COVID-19 transmission. With a demographically
representative 60% staff participation rate, these data offer an unprecedented view into the
seroprevalence of the target population of a Midwest US public school system. The estimated
1·7% seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among LCSC staff is far below that reported in

metropolitan areas throughout the US at the time of testing, underscoring the large and
continued risk of COVID-19 transmission within this community upon exposure.​16​ As a point of
comparison, Lake County, Indiana, the county within which the LCSC resides, had 4,985
reported cases of COVID-19, representing 1.0% of the county’s population.​17
Although the effect of mask wearing on seropositivity, utilizing a directed acyclic graph to
identify potential confounders, did not achieve statistical significance, this result should not be
interpreted as a lack of efficacy in the use of masks given the overwhelming quality and quantity
of data supporting their continued use, and is likely due to lack of power.​18​ Both univariate and
multivariable analyses demonstrate that a previous positive COVID-19 test or a history of
contact with a COVID-19 patient were associated with seropositivity. The 7-fold increase in odds
of seropositivity for individuals with a positive contact history is especially noteworthy amongst
the vast majority (n=749) of the individuals without a previous positive COVID-19 test. Although
these relationships are associational, the combination of low staff seroprevalence and the
strong positive association of seropositivity with contact history highlights a high risk group for
which the importance of aggressive contact tracing would be efficient and which would minimize
the transmission of COVID-19, as well as continued protective procedures during school hours
such as mask and face shield wearing, social distancing, and frequent disinfection of school
property.​19
This study has several limitations. Although data were collected from staff employed at 11
different sites (10 schools and the transportation facility), only the LCSC was involved in the
study, limiting the generalizability of this work. Neither ethnicity nor income data were collected,
precluding analysis of these variables’ previously demonstrated associations with COVID-19
positivity.​20​ We rely on study participants to self-report variables, excluding antibody status and
blood type, via questionnaire. Some questions may be insufficiently granular, such as the binary
mask wearing variable, and participants may also make errors filling out the questionnaire.
Insufficient granularity is likely to make groups defined by the variable more similar to each
other, while reporting errors are likely to be random and unrelated to the outcome, antibody
status. Thereby both will be expected to create bias towards the null, meaning that the results
reported in this study are conservative. The low baseline seroprevalence (22 positive tests in
the 753-person cohort) prevents the identification of more subtle, but potentially real,
associations among the collected variables and seropositivity. Additionally, the lack of
county-level seroprevalence data prevents comparison to the broader population outside of the
school district. Finally, data was not collected on students in the corporation, preventing the
investigation of a potential link between staff or student positivity and transmission within or
between these two co-exposed groups.
The reopening of US schools poses a potential risk of COVID-19 transmission to both staff and
students.The low pre-opening seroprevalence, in combination with the advanced age of a
significant fraction of the LCSC staff, may increase the number and severity of cases should an
outbreak occur within this school system, or other school systems sharing its demographic
characteristics. Teachers should consider deploying novel teaching strategies that limit the
amount of non-distanced interactions. Administrators and legislators should allocate the
