Abstract

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of immense public
health concern. Efforts to control the disease have only proven mildly successful, and the disease
will likely continue to cause excessive fatalities until effective preventative measures (such as a
vaccine) are developed. To develop disease management strategies, a better understanding of
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and population susceptibility to infection are needed. To this end,
physiologically-relevant mathematical modeling can provide a robust in silico tool to understand
COVID-19 pathophysiology and the in vivo dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Guided by ACE2-tropism
(ACE2 receptor dependency for infection) of the virus, and by incorporating cellular-scale viral
dynamics and innate and adaptive immune responses, we have developed a multiscale mechanistic
model for simulating the time-dependent evolution of viral load distribution in susceptible organs
of the body (respiratory tract, gut, liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, and brain). Following calibration
with in vivo and clinical data, we used the model to simulate viral load progression in a virtual
patient with varying degrees of compromised immune status. Further, we conducted global
sensitivity analysis of model parameters and ranked them for their significance in governing
clearance of viral load to understand the effects of physiological factors and underlying conditions
on viral load dynamics. Antiviral drug therapy, interferon therapy, and their combination was
simulated to study the effects on viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2. The model revealed the
dominant role of innate immunity (specifically interferons and resident macrophages) in
controlling viral load, and the importance of timing when initiating therapy following infection.

Introduction

In January 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified
as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. It was soon
established that droplet-based human to human transmission was occurring, and on March 11,
2020, the World Health Organization characterized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a
pandemic. As of this article’s submission date, COVID-19 has infected more than 44.9 million
people, causing more than one million deaths. A pandemic-scale outbreak creates tremendous
socioeconomic burden due to thwarted productivity, a spike in healthcare expenses, and irreparable
loss of human lives1, 2. Furthermore, implementation of social and physical isolation measures has
caused many countries to declare states of emergency and lockdowns with border closures.

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh identified human coronavirus and the third novel one to emerge in the
last 20 years. It is a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of about 30,000 nucleotides that
encodes ~27 proteins and four structural proteins. A surface-expressed spike protein mediates
receptor binding and membrane fusion with host cells, and the virus interacts with the angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into cells3. ACE2 mRNA is present in almost
all human organs, but the receptor is particularly highly expressed on the surface of lung alveolar
epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, thereby allowing a preferential accumulation
of the virus in these organs4. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from about 3-17 days,
and COVID-19 diagnosis cannot be made based on symptoms alone as, most are nonspecific and
may be confused for more common ailments. The more serious sequelae of infection includes
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis caused by the cytokine storm from the

immune response to infection, which is believed to be the leading cause of mortality in COVID19 patients5. Screening for COVID-19 is done via nucleic acid testing by RT-PCR (specimens
from both upper and lower respiratory tracts) and pulmonary CT scans. The viral load in naso- or
oro-pharyngeal swabs is the key clinical biomarker of COVID-19 and also the key clinical
endpoint of pharmacological intervention.

Although several antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are being used for symptomatic treatment
and viral load reduction, there are still no proven therapeutics for COVID-19 to date. To explore
novel and effective therapeutic targets, we require a better understanding of the pathogenesis of
COVID-19, particularly of virus-host interactions6. This will also enable more efficient disease
management strategies, such as deriving prognostic information from viral load kinetics, and
quantification of the effects of the immune system in controlling the disease. With limited studies
on the in vivo dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, a mathematical modeling approach can be an excellent,
complementary tool for investigating viral-host interactions and simulating COVID-19
pathogenesis in order to better understand disease progression and evaluate treatment strategies.
Indeed, the application of mathematical modeling and quantitative methods has been instrumental
in our understanding of viral-host interactions of various viruses, including influenza, HIV, HBV,
and HCV7. These kinetic models have been developed for various spatial scales, including
molecular, cellular, multicellular, organ, and organism. By analyzing viral load kinetics, these
models have deepened our understanding of the fundamentals of virus-host interaction dynamics,
innate and acquired immunity, mechanisms of action of drugs, and drug resistance8-12.

While the fundamental principles governing different viral infections are similar among most viral
species, the kinetics of the underlying mechanisms may vary based on the virus type. Researchers
are already using mathematical models to understand the outbreak of COVID-19 in order to guide
the efforts of governments worldwide in containing the spread of infection. While most of the
models developed so far have focused on the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 to understand
the inter-human transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-213-17, there are a few studies that have
investigated its virus-host interactions and pathogenesis. For example, Goyal et al. developed a
mathematical model to predict the therapeutic outcomes of various COVID-19 treatment
strategies18. Their model is based on target cell-limited viral dynamics19 and incorporates the
immune response to infection in order to predict viral load dynamics in patients pre- and posttreatment with various antiviral drugs. This model was used to project viral dynamics under
hypothetical clinical scenarios involving drugs with varying potencies, different treatment timings
post-infection, and levels of drug resistance, and the results of this study suggest the application
of potent antiviral drugs prior to the peak viral load stage, i.e. in the pre-symptomatic stage, as an
effective means of controlling infection in the body. Further, Wang et al. developed a prototype
multiscale model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics at the tissue scale6, wherein an agent-based
modeling approach was used to simulate intracellular viral replication and spread of infection to
neighboring cells. To unravel the mechanistic underpinnings of clinical phenotypes of COVID-19,
Sahoo et al. developed a mechanistic model that studies the intercellular interactions between
infected cells and immune cells20. Also, Ke et al. developed a model to quantify early dynamics of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and used the model to predict
infectiousness and disease severity based on viral load dynamics and immune response to
infection21. Although also a target cell-limited model, by only including upper and lower

respiratory tract compartments, this model omits key biological mechanisms involved in the
complete immune response, and is thus unable to provide deeper insights into the system-wide
dynamics and interplay of disease response.

In order to improve upon the existing models, we have developed a multiscale semi-mechanistic
model of viral dynamics, which, in addition to capturing virus-host interactions locally, is also
capable of simulating the whole-body dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is thereby capable
of providing insights into disease pathophysiology and the typical and atypical presentations of
COVID-19. Importantly, using our modeling platform, we can identify treatment strategies for
effective viral load suppression under various clinically relevant scenarios. We note that while the
modeling platform is developed for SARS-CoV-2, we also expect it to be applicable to other
viruses that have shared similarities in mechanisms of infection and physical dimensions.

Results and Discussion

Model development, calibration, and baseline solution
We have developed a semi-mechanistic mathematical model to simulate the whole-body
biodistribution kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 following infection through the nasal route (Figure 1;
Methods: Model development). The model was formulated as a system of ordinary differential
equations (Equations 1–40) that describe cellular-scale viral dynamics, whole-body transport and
excretion of viruses, and innate and adaptive immune response to predict the viral load kinetics of
SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract, plasma, and other organs of the body. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits
ACE2 tropism22, therefore the organs included in the model were chosen based on the presence of
ACE2 receptor expressing cells in their tissues23-25. Specifically, the key processes described by
the model include infection of ACE-2 expressing susceptible cells by SARS-CoV-2 (also referred
to as target cells), production of new virions by infected cells, death of infected cells due to
cytopathic effect, transport of virions from the site of infection to other organs of the body,
hepatobiliary excretion of the virions, and key processes in the innate and adaptive immune
response against the virus and infected cells to clear the infection. Note that in the absence of a
thorough understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of viral shedding in the feces26, and a
growing evidence of liver damage in COVID-19 patients27, 28, we assumed bile production rate as
the rate limiting step in the hepatobiliary excretion of the virus into the feces.

While some of the parameters of the model were known a priori (Table 1), the remaining
parameters were estimated through nonlinear regression using published in vivo29 and clinical30
data. Specifically, from published experimental data for hamsters29, we first calibrated a reduced

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20215335; this version posted November 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

version of the model (referred to as Reduced model; Equations 1-23) that comprises all
compartments and interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immunity, but lacks adaptive immunity
(bottom half of Figure 1; also see workflow in Figure 2). The parameters of the reduced model
characterize cellular-scale viral dynamics, IFN-mediated immunity, inter-compartment viral
transport, and hepatobiliary excretion of the virus from the mononuclear phagocytic system
(MPS). The estimated parameters were then used in the complete version of the model (referred
to as Full model; Equations 1–40), which also includes adaptive immunity, to calibrate the
remaining parameters using nonlinear regression with clinical data30. The models were solved
numerically in MATLAB as an initial value problem, using the built-in stiff ODE solver ode15s.

Calibrating parameters of the reduced model
As shown in Figure 3, the numerical solution of the reduced model for whole-body viral kinetics,
IFN kinetics, and target cell population kinetics in hamsters satisfies the initial conditions, and is
in good agreement with the available in vivo data29 for viral and IFN kinetics (Pearson correlation
coefficient R between experimental data and model fits is > 0.97, p < 0.0001, Figure S1a). The
corresponding parameter estimates are given in Table 2. Based on findings in the in vivo study by
Chan et al.29 that the adaptive immune response in test animals was not triggered during the first
seven days post-infection, it is reasonable to use the reduced form of the model to estimate the
unknown parameters, rather than using the full model at this point.

The model solution (Figure 3) shows the kinetics of ACE2-expressing target cells (solid orange
lines) and their infected counterparts (dashed orange lines) in every compartment. These infected
cells can produce new virions that will in turn infect other healthy target cells. Because we are

using a target-cell limited modeling assumption9, 18, the healthy target cells that become infected
by the virus are not replaced by new healthy cells, and as seen in Figure 3, the target cells were
observed to deplete within 48 h post infection. The viral load kinetics (blue curve) is primarily
governed by the interplay of new virion production, distribution of the virions between
compartments, viral elimination by alveolar and MPS macrophages, hepatobiliary excretion of
viruses from the body, cytopathic death of infected cells, and suppression of viral production due
to IFN produced by infected cells9, which is shown in Figure 3i. As the infected cell population
tapers, the IFN concentration will also decrease to the pre-infection baseline value. In our model,
infected cells of the respiratory tract are the source of IFN following infection, the lack of which
has been found to be the underlying cause of life-threatening COVID-19 due to uncontrolled viral
replication in the absence of IFN regulation31-33.

Of note, the plasma compartment (Figure 3h) of the model does not contain any target cell
population and thus its viral load kinetics is only governed by the influx and outflux of viruses
from various compartments. However, in the full model, the neutralization of viruses by antibodies
will also be considered in the plasma compartment, as discussed in the next section. Plasma flow
is the key mechanism of viral transport and systemic spread of infection in the body 34, but due to
lack of established mechanistic underpinnings of these processes, we instead use
phenomenological rate constants to characterize viral transport. Based on the estimated
characteristic times (1-24 h) of the vascular transport processes (shown in Figure 1 and presented
as rates in Table 2), it can be inferred that viral transport is permeability-limited and not perfusionlimited, i.e., capillary permeability and vascular surface area govern the rate of extravasation of
virions from blood vessels into tissue interstitium to reach the target cells, and thus viral transport

is not exclusively governed by the plasma flow rates into the organs. This is consistent with the in
vivo behavior of nanomaterials of comparable size35-40, and is in contrast to the perfusion ratelimited kinetics of smaller lipophilic molecules. The variability in characteristic times of vascular
transport can be explained by differences in the permeability of capillary endothelium due to
differences in pore sizes of endothelial fenestrae41. For instance, the blood brain barrier seems to
resist transport of virus to the brain, thereby leading to an estimated characteristic time of influx
of 1 day, which is ~twenty-times longer than the estimated characteristic time of influx to the MPS
(1.25 h) that contains large sinusoidal pores in its microvasculature. Of note, the non-vascular
transport processes have relatively longer characteristic times that can be attributed to resistance
to transport offered by mucus or degradation caused by pH, among other factors.

Calibrating parameters of the full model
Once the parameters discussed in the previous section were estimated, they were then used in the
full model to calibrate the remaining parameters (see Table 3) relevant to the innate and adaptive
immune system using published clinical data (n = 4 untreated patients)30. Due to the uncertainty
associated with the duration between day of infection and onset of symptoms (referred to as
incubation period), a shifting parameter 𝜏 was included in the calibration routine. Numerically, the
time points corresponding to the data were shifted 𝜏 units of time. As shown in Figure 4, the model
correctly represents the initial conditions of the variables and predicts an incubation period 𝜏 of ~6
days (indicated by red arrow in Figure 4a), which is comparable to published literature42. Also,
assuming nasal route as the route of infection, the numerical solution for URT at time 𝑡 = 0
suggests exposure to a viral load of ~107 copies/mL. The clinical data shows the viral load kinetics
in the upper (Figure 4a) and lower respiratory tract (Figure 4b), the IFN kinetics (Figure 4i), the

effector CD8+ (CD8*) and activated CD4+ (CD4*) cell population kinetics (Figure 4k), and the
total neutralizing antibody kinetics (Figure 4l). As shown in Figure 4, the full model solution fits
the data well (Pearson correlation coefficient R > 0.98, p < 0.0001, Figure S1b), and was able to
predict the kinetics of viral load in the remaining compartments by using the viral dynamics and
transport parameters estimated from the in vivo data (through calibration of the reduced model).
The model predicts that the viral load in extrapulmonary organs and plasma persists for ~17-20
days post onset of symptoms, consistent with published studies43, and is thus comparable to the
duration of viral detection in URT and LRT. Therefore, it can be also inferred that nasopharyngeal
swabs can safely provide an indication of the infection status of the patients.

The model also shows the kinetics of naïve lymphocytes (Figure 4j) and antibody producing
plasma cells (Figure 4k) in the lymphatic compartment, which is represented as a common
compartment for the entire body. Importantly, in close agreement with published literature44, 45,
the model predicts that the systemic concentration of antibodies persists above the detectable limit
for >100 days post onset of symptoms, following which it may no longer be detectable (Figure
4l). This finding suggests the lack of indefinite antibody protection against reinfection46, and
highlights the need for vaccine boosters to achieve long-lasting immunity47. We note that the data
used in the above calibrations was obtained under conditions where neither the animals nor the
patients were given any pharmacological treatment. Hence, the data are appropriate to calibrate
the effects of the immune components and other physiological processes in distributing and
eliminating the viral load.

While URT and LRT are the preferred sites to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, it is important
to note, and as is evident from the model predictions, that the viral load in non-pulmonary organs
can attain comparable levels, and can thus explain the non-respiratory symptoms observed in some
COVID-19 patients28, 48, 49. Following transport of the virus from respiratory tract to blood or via
gastrointestinal tract to blood, organs that have a significant population of ACE2 expressing cells
may become infected by the virus, leading to the extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19
that may include symptoms such as diarrhea and impaired renal-, hepatic-, cardiovascular-, or
neurological-functions.

Individualized effects of immune components on viral kinetics
To investigate the effects of the cellular and humoral arms of innate and adaptive immunity on
viral load kinetics in the body, we individually switched off these components and simulated the
whole-body viral kinetics for up to the time when viral load fell below the detectable limit18 of 102
copies ml-1. This numerical experiment is meant to mimic the effect of compromised immunity
due to an underlying condition in a virtual patient undergoing no antiviral treatment. As seen in
the viral kinetics in Figure 5, when one or all of the immune components were shut down, the
viral concentration in all the compartments was higher than the baseline (dashed dark red line).
Further, it can be inferred that IFN is the primary mechanism of controlling viral load in the URT
(Figure 5a) and GI (Figure 5c), while macrophages (alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells, and
splenic macrophages) play a predominant role in limiting infection in the LRT, MPS, plasma, and
other organs, followed by IFNs (Figures 5b, 5d-5h). Findings in the literature support the above
observations as follows. Lack of IFNs can lead to excessive viral production33 and cause lifethreating COVID-19 in patients deficient in functional IFNs due to, for example, the occurrence

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20215335; this version posted November 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

of loss-of-function mutations in genes governing IFN-mediated immunity32 or auto-antibodies
against IFNs31. Further, FABP4+ alveolar macrophages were observed to be largely absent in
patients with severe COVID-19, but were a predominant macrophage in patients with mild
disease50, indicating the major role of FABP4+ alveolar macrophages in controlling infection as
also shown previously for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)51. We
assume a constant supply of macrophages in the lungs and MPS in our model, but a deleterious
effect of infection on these immune cells cannot be ruled out, and further experimental evidence
is necessary to model the cell population kinetics appropriately52. Further, the model reveals that
the effect of adaptive immunity (antibodies and CD8* cells) is not significant in controlling
infection, but it does not necessarily rule out the therapeutic potential of exogenously administered
antibodies or novel cell-based therapies (e.g. T cell therapy).

All the above scenarios abstractly represent real-world underlying conditions (e.g. cancer,
diabetes, autoimmune diseases) in patients that lead to varying degrees of immunosuppression,
thus highlighting the importance of an individual’s immune status in regulating viral kinetics. In
the absence of immune responses, the only plausible mechanism that brings the viral load down is
hepatobiliary excretion of the virus through the MPS, but our results show it takes several weeks
before the viral load falls below the detectable value of 102 copies ml-1. Note that upon shutting
down IFN- and macrophage-mediated immunity or total immunity, the viral load grew beyond
clinically observed values in the literature (~1012 copies/ml), therefore we set an upper bound at
1012 copies/ml to keep the results clinically meaningful.

To identify the significance of model parameters in affecting viral load kinetics, we performed
global sensitivity analysis using the full model (Figure 6). The model outputs used to investigate
the influence of input model parameter perturbations were area under the curves of viral load

As shown in Figure 6a-f, multivariate linear regression analysis (MLRA)-based sensitivity indices
provide insight into the relative importance of model parameters in governing viral load kinetics.
𝑖
The ranking obtained from MLRA (Figure 6g) suggests that the total viral load (AUC0−30
) in

URT, LRT, and plasma (indicator of systemic behavior) is strongly dependent on viral production
rate (𝑃𝑣 ), IFN production rate (𝑃IFN ), and cytopathic death rate of infected cells (𝐷1 ). Cytopathic
death of infected cells is a property of the system that may be hard to manipulate
pharmacologically, therefore IFN concentration and viral production rate are conceivably the
targets best-suited for pharmacological interventions to constrain the viral load in patients 53.
Treatment over a combination of the two parameters, i.e., IFN and viral production rates, can be
more efficient than monotherapy in suppressing viral load, as also suggested by clinical studies54,
55. While

cytopathic death rate and viral production rate play major roles in governing the clearance

𝑖
time of viruses ( 𝑡clear
), IFN production rate is relatively less significant. Further, transport

processes play a significant role in governing both total viral load and time to clear the load.
Specifically, the transport of virus from URT to LRT (𝐶1) affects viral load in URT, and blood to
MPS via the hepatic artery (𝐻𝐴 ) and MPS to blood via the hepatic vein (𝐻𝑉 ) govern the clearance
time from plasma, which should also affect the viral clearance of other organs connected to plasma.

Also, the elimination rate of viruses by alveolar macrophages (𝜆𝐿 ) and MPS macrophages (𝜆𝑀 )
are important parameters in governing the kinetics of viral load in LRT and plasma, respectively.
Finally, the total viral load in LRT is also affected by pulmonary absorption (𝐴1 ), i.e. by the rate
of transport of viruses from LRT to plasma.

Clinical application of model
Up to this point, we have demonstrated that the model was able to reproduce viral kinetics that
were consistent with experimentally measured values and produce observations consistent with
published literature. We next sought to examine whether this tool can make predictions that might
allow clinicians to design an effective therapy for patients, helping to optimize and personalize
their treatment regimen. As a numerical experiment, we tested three treatment scenarios in
controlling infection: a hypothetical antiviral agent, interferon therapy, and antiviral agentinterferon combination therapy. Further, the effects of the timing of therapy initiation (𝑡 𝑇 ) were
also tested, i.e., starting therapy on the day of onset of symptoms (𝑡 𝑇 = 𝑡 onset ), and starting
therapy 5 days post onset of symptoms (𝑡 𝑇 = 𝑡 onset + 5). To quantify treatment effectiveness, we
compared the viral load kinetics in three compartments, namely, URT, LRT, and plasma in
simulations spanning a period of four weeks.

Antiviral therapy
We simulated therapy with a hypothetical antiviral agent that has the same mechanism of action
as Remdesivir56, i.e. interference with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For this, 200 mg loading
dose (≡initial plasma concentration 𝐶0 = 5 𝜇M, assuming a molecular weight of 800 g/mol and a
volume of distribution of 50 L), followed by 100 mg daily maintenance doses for 9 additional

days, via intravenous injection were simulated to mimic the pharmacological intervention.
Treatment was started at one of the two time points previously mentioned. As a simplification,
assuming one-compartment pharmacokinetics for the hypothetical drug with elimination rate
constant 𝑘Cl = 1 𝑑 −1 , we use the plasma concentration kinetics as a surrogate for tissue
concentration kinetics of the drug. The plasma concentration 𝛼(𝑡) is thus given by,
𝛼V (𝑡) = ∑ 𝐶0 ⋅ 1𝑡≥𝑖 (𝑡) ⋅ exp(−𝑘Cl ⋅ (𝑡 − 𝑖)),

Hence, the injection times are 𝑖 = 𝑡 𝑇 , 𝑡 𝑇 + 1, … , 𝑡 𝑇 + 9, and we define this set of times as 𝑆 𝑇 . The
antiviral agent acts by inhibiting the production rate 𝑃𝑣 of virus from infected cells in the body,

and is chosen to be 0.77 𝜇M. Plasma concentration kinetics 𝛼V (𝑡) of the drug is shown in the inset
of Figure 7a for the scenario when the treatment was initiated on the day of onset of symptoms.

As shown in Figure 7a-c, under the considered therapeutic regimen, the antiviral therapy shows a
significant impact on viral load reduction compared to the no treatment scenario, irrespective of
the timing of initiation of therapy. However, an early initiation of antiviral therapy led to a lesser
total viral load and a faster reduction of the load, which is consistent with results of other studies18.

Interferon therapy
We simulated treatment with interferon beta-1a, with and without the hypothetical antiviral agent
(discussed above). For this, four subcutaneous injections (Dose = 44 µg each) of interferon beta-

The plasma concentration kinetics of interferon beta-1a 𝛼I (𝑡) is obtained by solving the following
equation:

Hence, the injection times are 𝑖 = 𝑡 𝑇 , 𝑡 𝑇 + 2, … , 𝑡 𝑇 + 6, and we define this set of times as 𝑄𝑇 . The
plasma concentration kinetics 𝛼I (𝑡) of interferon beta-1a is shown in the inset of Figure 7d for
the scenario when the treatment was initiated on the day of onset of symptoms. Here, the
parameters 𝑘absorp , Vsc, and 𝑘excr , which represent the absorption of interferon beta-1a from the
site of injection to the blood stream, volume of the injection site, and excretion rate of interferon
beta-1a, respectively, were estimated by fitting the above equation to literature derived
concentration kinetics data57. The estimated parameter values for 𝑘absorp = 7.04 d-1, Vsc = 3.43 ml,
and 𝑘excr = 0.074 d-1. Of note, while interferon beta-1a acts in the same way as endogenous IFN,
i.e. by inhibiting the production rate 𝑃𝑣 of virus from infected cells, however we separately model
them to accommodate the possibility of unique pharmacokinetic properties of the two agents.
Therefore, the first term of viral load kinetics in the ODE for organ 𝑖 (see Methods) now becomes:

As shown in Figure 7d-f, interferon beta-1a therapy significantly reduces the viral load, and the
effect is comparable to the hypothetical antiviral agent. Also, an early initiation of therapy leads
to a lesser total viral load and a faster reduction in viral load.

Combination therapy
Finally, we tested the effect of combination therapy with the hypothetical antiviral agent and
interferon beta-1a on viral load kinetics (plasma concentration kinetics in the inset of Figure 7g).
As shown in Figure 7g-i, the combination therapy leads to a faster reduction in viral load compared
to the effect of antiviral agent and interferon beta-1a alone, such that the viral load seems to fall
below the detection threshold 2-3 days earlier.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a semi-mechanistic mathematical model that predicts the wholebody viral distribution kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 by incorporating cellular-scale viral dynamics,
relevant physiological processes of viral transport, innate and adaptive immune response, and viral
excretion. The model is well calibrated with published in vivo and clinical data and provides
insights into the importance of various components of the immune system in controlling infection.
Through global sensitivity analysis, we identified the key mechanisms that control infection and
can be used as potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention. Finally, we tested
the potential of such therapeutic targets by simulating clinically relevant treatment options and
identified the importance of the timing of treatment initiation, and the effects of various therapies
to suppress infection effectively and immediately. As a limitation of the model, it is important to
note that due to lack of clinical data for the viral load kinetics in extrapulmonary compartments,
we had to rely on the transport parameters estimated from in vivo data, and the model predictions
for the extrapulmonary compartments could not be clinically validated. As clinical knowledge of
the disease and its mechanisms improves, we will continue to fine-tune the model and integrate it

with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model to build an in-silico platform that can be used
to simulate disease progression and a more complete pharmacokinetics of various test drugs and
novel formulations.

Methods

1. Model development
In each organ compartment, we consider the kinetics of three populations. The first is the
concentration of healthy cells, denoted by 𝑦𝑖𝐻 (𝑡), where 𝑖 is an arbitrary compartment. The second
is the concentration of infected cells, denoted by 𝑦𝑖𝐼 (𝑡), and the third is the concentration of viral
particles 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡). The compartments that we consider are 𝑖 = [𝑈, 𝐿, 𝐺, 𝑀, 𝐻, 𝐾, 𝐵], where 𝑈 is the
upper respiratory tract (URT), 𝐿 is the lower respiratory tract (LRT), 𝐺 is the gastrointestinal tract
(GI), 𝑀 is the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), which encompasses the liver and the spleen,
𝐻 is the heart, 𝐾 denotes the kidneys, and 𝐵 is the brain. All organ compartments are connected
via the plasma compartment 𝑃(𝑡), in which we only consider the concentration of viral particles
in systemic circulation.

We assume that, due to the time scale under consideration, the population of healthy cells does not
replenish during the simulation window. Thus, the rate of change of healthy cells is modeled as a
decreasing function, which depends on the interaction between healthy cells and the surrounding
viral particles that infect them. The conversion rate of healthy cells to infected cells is denoted by
the infection rate 𝐼.

The rate of change of total infected cell population within an organ is a function of three
mechanisms. The first is an increase due to freshly infected healthy cells by viral particles, the
second is death due to cytopathic effect of viral infection, proportional to the number of infected
cells and characterized by the rate constant 𝐷1 , and the third is due to the interaction between
effector CD8+ cells (concentration denoted by CD8∗ (𝑡)) and the infected cells. The cytotoxic effect
is measured in terms of the death rate constant 𝐷CD8 . It is important to note that in the reduced
form of the model, infected cell death due to effector CD8* cells is not included. In our model
description, all activated immune cells are indicated with an asterisk (e.g., CD8*), while inactive
or Naïve populations are indicated by standard naming conventions (e.g., CD8+).

The concentration of viral particles in each organ compartment is influenced by different factors,
some of which are organ-specific. However, in all organ compartments, the rate of change of viral
particles is proportional to the number of infected cells with virus production constant 𝑃𝑣 , but is
inversely proportional to the concentration of IFN, denoted IFN(𝑡). IFN is part of the innate
immune response that acts by suppressing the viral production rate of infected cells, and is
controlled by the effectiveness constant 𝜀. In all compartments, viral particles may be neutralized
due to the aggregation of antibodies on their surface proteins. The antibody concentration is
represented by Ab(𝑡), and the destruction rate of viral particles due to antibodies is denoted by
𝐷Ab . Of note, neutralization of virus by antibodies is not incorporated in the reduced form of the
model. Lastly, the viral load can also be reduced by tissue resident macrophages in the lungs
(alveolar macrophages) and MPS (Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages) that engulf the viral
𝑀ϕ

particles and destroy them. The rate of removal of viral particles by macrophages is given by 𝜆𝑖 .

Note that the rate of change of viral particles in the URT depends on two clearance mechanisms.
These consist on the migration of viral particles from the URT to the LRT and from the URT to
the GI tract. The corresponding transport coefficients are 𝐶1 and 𝐶2, respectively.

As mentioned earlier, IFN limits the production of viral particles by infected cells. The rate of
production of this cytokine is regulated by two effects. One is a zero-th order generation term 𝐺IFN ,
and the second is proportional to the cumulative population of infected cells in the respiratory tract.
The proportionality constant in the second mechanism is 𝑃IFN . Further, IFN can degrade over time
at a rate given by 𝐷IFN .

Within the GI tract, in addition to the standard mechanisms, viral particles can be lost to the liver
via the hepatic portal vein. This rate is quantified through the intestinal absorption rate 𝐴2 .
Additionally, as discussed above, viral particles from the URT are transported to the GI tract at a
rate 𝐶2.

The rate of change of viral particles within the MPS can increase due to the particles collected
from the GI tract (𝐴2 ) and those incoming from systemic circulation through the hepatic artery
(𝐻𝐴 ). At the same time, particles can leave this compartment through the hepatic vein (𝐻𝑉 ), or
through the hepatobiliary excretion mechanism (𝐸).

Similar to the MPS, the rate of change of viral particles in the heart depend on two fluxes. One is
the incoming viral load from systemic circulation through the coronary arteries (CO𝐴 ), and the
second is the outgoing viral particles via the coronary veins (CO𝑉 ).

Given that the size of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is ~100 nm, we assume that renal excretion is not
feasible58. Therefore, the viral kinetics in kidneys is dependent on the standard mechanisms and is
affected by influx via the renal arteries (𝑅𝐴 ) and outflux via the renal veins (𝑅𝑉 ).

While the blood brain barrier may be deterrent to the establishment of infection in the brain, we
have included the brain compartment due to the lack of evidence for the former 59. Analogous to
the heart and kidney compartments, the brain receives viral particles delivered through systemic
circulation via the internal carotid arteries (CA𝐴 ). Subsequently, viral particles can rejoin the
plasma compartment by means of the internal jugular veins (𝐽𝑉 ).

The equation for the plasma compartment incorporates all the outgoing fluxes of viral particles
through arteries (𝐻𝐴 , 𝑅𝐴 , CO𝐴 , CA𝐴 ) and the incoming fluxes via veins (𝐻𝑉 , 𝑅𝑉 , CO𝑉 , 𝐽𝑉 ). Also,
the viral load from LRT in equation (6) gets added to plasma at rate 𝐴1 . Lastly, similar to all the
previous compartments, viral particles can be neutralized by antibodies at a rate 𝐷Ab .

The model up to this point is the reduced model, and the only equation that captures the immune
system is equation (7). This equation describes the change of concentration of IFN, which is part
of the innate immune system. However, the adaptive immune system should activate to properly
mount a full immune response. The equations that follow provide the remaining elements to initiate
and maintain a humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune response to make up the full model.

Equations (24)-(30) model the concentration of naïve antigen presenting cells (APCs) APC𝑖 (𝑡) in
a given compartment 𝑖. These cells predominantly act as carriers, transporting remnants of viral
particles to the lymphatic compartment to raise the alarm in the adaptive arm of the immune
system. In order to keep the population of APCs at steady state, a replenishing mechanism is
included. It is proportional to the difference between the current concentration APC𝑖 (𝑡), and the
generic steady state value ̅̅̅̅̅
APC , divided by the absolute value of the same difference plus a
modulating constant that we set = 1, i.e.,

definition is that if the concentration APC𝑖 (𝑡) is close to APC
if the difference is large, the denominator is equally large, and the ratio is close to one. This allows
a near constant modulation rate that only acts whenever the population of macrophages is far from
equilibrium. This reequilibration rate is denoted by 𝐺APC . The APC population is also impacted by
the interaction between APCs and invading viral particles. This causes the population of APCs to

As mentioned earlier, the concentration of activated APCs, denoted by APC ∗ (𝑡), increases at a rate
proportional to the conversion rate 𝑇APC of naïve APCs to the activated state. At the same time,
activated APCs can become incapacitated or simply eliminated after a certain period of time. These
processes are pooled into the APC death rate constant 𝐷APC .

The remaining equations in the model describe either lymphocyte or antibody concentrations. The
lymphocytes under consideration are CD8+, CD4+, and B cells. The concentration of the naïve or
inactivated version of these populations is represented by CD8(𝑡) , CD4(𝑡) , and BC(𝑡) ,
respectively. Similar to the APC case, the steady state concentration for each of these cell types is
denoted with a horizontal bar on top of each variable. This value is maintained using a mechanism
(𝑋(𝑡)−𝑋̅)

analogous to the APC case, i.e., through the term −𝐺𝑋 ⋅ 1+|𝑋(𝑡)−𝑋̅| , where 𝑋 is the corresponding

Furthermore, each of these lymphocytes can be promoted to its activated state, which we denote
with an asterisk, 𝑋 ∗ . This conversion takes place when activated APCs interact with naïve
lymphocytes, presenting them fragments of the ingested viral particles. The transformation rate
from the naïve state to the activated one is represented by the constant 𝑇𝑋 , where 𝑋 indicates the
cell type. For the case of CD4+ and CD8+, we use the common rate 𝑇T . The concentration of
activated lymphocytes can fluctuate due to two mechanisms. One is the conversion of naïve cells,
which was already discussed. The second is due to death caused by a variety of factors like
exhaustion or apoptosis, and is expressed through the death constant 𝐷𝑋 . B cells, however, follow
a different mechanism, which we discuss later.

Activated B cells alone cannot neutralize the viral load. They must first transform into plasma
cells, which then in turn produce antibodies that can carry out the viral neutralization. The
transition from activated B cell to plasma cell is enabled by activated CD4 * cells. This
transformation can generate two types of plasma cell: short-lived (S) and long-lived (L). The
S
L
transition rates are represented by the constants 𝑇BC
and 𝑇BC

of plasma cells is denoted by P S (𝑡) and P L (𝑡) , respectively. Lastly, each type possesses a
particular death rate, indicated by the constant 𝐷PS for the short-lived type and 𝐷PL for the longlived type.

The final equation in the model describes the rate of change of antibody concentration, Ab(𝑡). The
sole contributors to the production of antibodies are short-lived and long-lived plasma cells. The
corresponding production rates are given by 𝐺PS and 𝐺PL , respectively. We consider two
mechanisms by which antibodies can be consumed or eliminated. One is the loss of antibodies due
to their interaction with viral particles in a given compartment with rate constant 𝜆Ab . The second
is the elimination of antibodies by other factors independent of the viral load, e.g., degradation or
clearance from tissues, which occurs at rate constant ClAb . A summary of the parameters used in
the model is given in Tables 1-3.

2. Parametric analysis

Once the full set of parameters for the model has been defined and fixed for the conditions
corresponding to Figure 4, we proceed to identify the relative effect of each parameter on the viral
kinetics. This is done by systematically perturbing one or multiple parameters and comparing the
outcomes between the perturbed state and the original state. To quantify the differences between
the two states we introduce the following 6 criteria. The first three refer to the area under the curve
(AUC) of the viral load curves in the URT, the LRT, and the Plasma compartment for a period of
30 days. Mathematically,
30

AUC𝑖 = ∫ 𝑣𝑖 (𝑡) 𝑑𝑡 , for 𝑖 in {𝑈, 𝐿, 𝑃}.
0

The next three denote the total time required for the viral load in the URT, LRT, and Plasma
compartment to reduce to < 102 viral copies per mL, i.e., 2 in log base 10 units. The last
comparison criterion is the antibody titer at day 30 in the body, i.e., Ab(𝑡 = 30). In the next two

subsections we compare each of the 6 criteria using global sensitivity analysis (GSA), applied to
the 31 parameters.

Global sensitivity analysis
Local sensitivity analysis only allows one parameter to change at a time, and thus may not be
suitable for analyzing complex biological systems. We performed global sensitivity analysis
(GSA36,

54, 55;

i.e., multiple parameters can be varied simultaneously) to obtain a further

understanding of the relationship between parameters and their combined effects on the model
outputs of interest. Specifically, in our analysis, all parameters were perturbed at the same time,
and we assume a uniform distribution for each parameter. The range of values of each sample was
PR ± 99%(PR), where PR is the reference value of a given parameter. To ensure a complete
sampling of the full parameter space we used a Latin hypercube sampling scheme. Subsequently,
each sample was used to recompute the kinetics, from which we extract the 6 criteria mentioned
above. In total, 10 batches of 5000 samples each were computed. Then, the data were subjected to
a multivariate linear regression analysis to produce an impact factor, which we label as the
sensitivity index (SI). Lastly, the sensitivity indices were ranked by means of a one-way ANOVA
and a Tukey’s test. The higher the SI, the more significance a parameter holds. A detailed
description of the GSA workflow can be found in38,
MATLAB R2018a.

Figure 2. Modeling workflow. In the first step, the reduced model uses the hamster data to fit
parameters corresponding to viral dynamics, transport coefficients, and innate immunity.
Subsequently, the more complex full model uses the previously estimated parameters and clinical
data to estimate the remaining parameters pertaining to the adaptive and innate immune responses.
Lastly, simulations are generated to make predictions, and statistical analyses are performed to
extract useful information.

Figure 6. Global sensitivity analysis. All parameters are perturbed simultaneously from their
reference value. The ranking of each parameter is quantified as the sensitivity index (SI, y-axis)
measured under six criteria. The first three are area under the curves of viral load kinetics
𝑖
(AUC0−30
) for the first 30 days in the a) URT, b) LRT, and c) plasma compartment. The next three
𝑖
are the total time (𝑡clear
) required for the viral load to fall below the detectable concentration of

102 copies ml-1 in the d) URT, e) LRT, and f) plasma compartment. Each SI is accompanied with
an error bar resulting from the sampling distribution. g) Heat map indicating the ranking of the
parameters based on the magnitude of the sensitivity index.
