Abstract

19

20

Background

21

22

People with severe mental ill health (SMI) experience a mortality gap of 15-20 years. COVID-

23

19 has amplified population health inequalities, and there is concern that people with SMI

24

will be disproportionately affected. Understanding how health risk behaviours have changed

25

during the pandemic is important when developing strategies to mitigate future increases in

26

health inequalities.

27

28

Methods

29

30

We sampled from an existing cohort of people with SMI. Researchers contacted participants

31

by phone or post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic had

32

affected them. We asked people about their health risk behaviours and how these had

33

changed during the pandemic. We created an index of changed behaviours, comprising

34

dietary factors, smoking, lack of exercise, and drinking patterns. By creating data linkages,

35

we compared their responses during pandemic restrictions to responses they gave prior to

36

the pandemic.

37

38

Outcomes

39

40

367 people provided health risk data. 47.5% of participants reported taking less physical

41

activity during the pandemic and of those who smoke 54.5% reported smoking more heavily.

42

Self-reported deterioration in physical health and younger age were significantly associated

46

Interpretation

47

48

COVID-19 is likely to amplify health inequalities for people with SMI. Health services should

49

target health risk behaviours for people with SMI to mitigate the immediate and long lasting

50

impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

59

60

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact on public health in ways that extend beyond the

61

number of deaths attributable to coronavirus (1, 2). One possible impact on public health is

62

a change in health related behaviours, which may be affected by the social measures

63

introduced to limit the spread of the virus (pandemic restrictions) such as minimizing social

64

contacts and staying at home. The pandemic restrictions, coupled with daily news coverage

65

of the number of COVID-19 related deaths, are likely to impact on people in a variety of

66

ways. For example, the perceived risks of contracting COVID-19 may provide a ‘teachable

67

moment’ that acts as a prompt to encourage people to make changes to their behaviour;

68

such as cutting down on drinking alcohol and smoking or increasing physical activity (3). On

69

the other hand, concerns about COVID-19 may lead people to avoid undertaking physical

70

activity outdoors and lead more sedentary lives. Additionally concerns around contracting

71

the virus, increased social isolation or the stress as a result of the pandemic restrictions may

72

lead some people to drink and smoke more and find it more difficult to make healthy food

73

choices (4). Furthermore, access to healthy food may have become more difficult due to

74

fears about supermarkets, difficulty in assessing online food shopping and closure of cafes

75

and community projects where people may have accessed healthy meals. In addition, the

76

closure of gyms and swimming pools may have impacted on physical activity levels (5).

77

78

Understanding the impacts of the pandemic restrictions on health-related behaviours is

79

important for assessing the wider public health consequences of the pandemic. In turn this

80

is also helpful in informing how these impacts can be mitigated. Addressing health risk

81

behaviours remains a public health priority (6, 7). Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption,

82

physical inactivity and obesity (8-10) are some of the leading causes of disease and

83

premature death worldwide. The effects of the pandemic on health related behaviours in

84

the general population have been mixed. It has been reported that in the early stages of the

85

pandemic 300,000 quit (smoking) for Covid (11), yet the percentage of people who smoke in

86

the general population remains very similar to the figure before the pandemic (12). A similar

87

picture has been reported for alcohol consumption, with high risk drinkers being more likely

88

to report trying to reduce their alcohol consumption at the start of the pandemic. However,

89

the prevalence of high risk drinking has increased (12). A study looking at behaviours

90

around weight and physical activity has shown comparable results, with some people

91

reporting having undertaken more physical activity and others reporting taking less (4).

92

Importantly, studies have generally demonstrated that the pandemic restrictions may have a

93

disproportionately large influence on behaviours which cause weight gain among adults with

94

a pre-existing higher BMI (4), and among people from lower socio-economic groups and

95

with pre-existing conditions (13).

96

97

It is possible that the pandemic and its associated restrictions will amplify already existing

98

health inequalities; people with severe mental ill health (SMI) are one such group that may

99

be adversely affected. People with SMI currently experience a mortality gap of 15-20 years

100

when compared to people without SMI (14, 15). One of the major drivers of this health gap

101

is preventable physical health conditions linked to behavioural risk factors such as smoking,

102

low physical activity and nutritionally-poor diet. Although studies have explored the impacts

103

of the pandemic and pandemic restrictions on the general population (4, 12, 13, 16) there

104

have, to the best of our knowledge, been no studies that have explored the health related

105

behaviours among people with SMI.

106

107

People with SMI are an especially vulnerable group who already experience significant

108

health inequalities. Understanding the specific difficulties encountered by people with SMI

109

becomes critical in identifying how to best to mitigate the risks of them experiencing further

110

deprivation and disadvantage during the current pandemic and beyond. People with SMI

111

are also under-researched with respect to health and health related behaviours, and we

112

were able examine this issue with respect to the COVID pandemic using a large clinical

113

cohort which was recruited in the years immediately prior to the pandemic restrictions(17).

114

115

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine self-reported changes in a range of health

116

related behaviors before vs during the pandemic in a transdiagnostic sample of people with

117

SMI.

118

119

Design

120

The Closing the Gap (CtG) study is a large (n=9, 914) transdiagnostic clinical cohort recruited

121

between April 2016 and March 2020. Participants have documented diagnoses of

122

schizophrenia or delusional/psychotic illness (ICD 10 F20.X & F22.X or DSM equivalent) or

123

bipolar disorder (ICD F31.X or DSM-equivalent). The composition of the CtG cohort has

124

previously been described (17), and the data at inception included descriptions of self-

125

reported alcohol consumption, consumption of fruit and vegetables, participation in physical

126

activity, smoking behavior and e-cigarette use.

127

128

We were funded to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sub-section of the

129

CtG clinical cohort and we identified participants for Optimising Well-being in Self-Isolation

130

study (OWLS) (https://sites.google.com/york.ac.uk/owls-study/home). To ensure that the

131

OWLS COVID-19 sub-cohort was captured a range of demographics we created a sampling

132

framework based on gender, age, ethnicity and whether they were recruited via primary or

133

secondary care. OWLS participants were recruited from 17 mental health trusts (across

134

urban and rural settings in England).

136

Recruitment and participants

137

Ethical approval was granted by the Health Research Authority North West – Liverpool

138

Central Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 20/NW/0276). To be eligible to take part

139

in OWLS COVID-19 study, people had to be aged 18 or over, to have taken part in CtG study

140

and have consented to be contacted again to be invited to further research. This enabled us

141

to create longitudinal data linkage and to rapidly identify participants during the COVID-19

142

pandemic.

143

144

Procedure

145

People who met the eligibility criteria were contacted by telephone or letter and invited to

146

take part in the OWLS COVID-19 study. Those who agreed to take part were provided with a

147

range of options; i. to carry out the survey over the phone with a researcher, ii. to be sent a

148

link to complete the survey online or iii. to be sent a hard copy of the questionnaire in the

149

post to complete and return.

150

151

Changes in health related behaviours

152

153

Participants were asked about five health related behaviours; (1) alcohol consumption, (2)

154

levels of physical activity, (3) fruit and vegetable consumption, (4) vaping and e-cigarette

155

use, and (5) smoking. For each health related behaviour participants were asked about how

156

often they engaged in that behaviour compared to before the pandemic and could chose

157

from the following options; I don’t do that in general, more than before, about the same or

158

less than before. For physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption a response of

159

‘less than before’ was considered to be a negative change in behaviour and for drinking,

160

smoking a response of more than before was considered to be a negative change in

161

behaviour. A cumulative index of harmful health related behaviours were calculated from 0

162

to 4, (18) we did not include vaping in this metric as vaping could be seen as a positive

163

change if it led to a harm reduction or abstinence from more harmful tobacco use (19).

164

165

Self-reported changes in health during pandemic restrictions

166

167

For both physical health and mental health study participants were asked ‘compared to your

168

life before the pandemic restrictions, how would you rate your health in general, ‘ with the

169

following response options; ‘better than before’, ‘about the same’, ‘worse than before’, ‘not

170

sure/ don’t know’. After excluding the participants who reported ‘not sure/ don’t know’, a

171

binary variable was derived coded as ‘decline in health’ (including those reporting worse

172

than before) and ‘no decline’ (including those reporting better than before or about the

173

same).

174

175

Global health and wellbeing

176

177

To align with general population estimates of health related behaviour, study participants

178

were asked four questions taken from the ONS Health and Lifestyle Survey (HLS) (20) about

179

how they had been feeling with a response option scored on a Likert scale of 0-10. The

180

questions asked were; (1) overall how satisfied are you with your life, (2) overall to what

181

extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile, (3) overall how happy

182

did you feel yesterday and overall how anxious did you feel yesterday. For the first three

183

questions a score of 0 indicated not at all and a score of 10 completely and for the final

184

question a score of 0 indicated not at all anxious and 10 indicated completely anxious. After

185

reversing the scores for the anxiety question the scores for the four questions were totaled

186

to give a total wellbeing score (0-40), with higher scores indicating greater wellbeing.

Ethnicity

190

Ethnicity was used to define a binary minority variable (BAME (Black, Asian and minority

191

ethnic) and non-BAME).

192

193

Indices of multiple deprivation

194

195

We used postcodes already collected at the point of inception to the CtG study to determine

196

levels of deprivation using the level of deprivation assigned to postcodes by the Ministry of

197

Housing, Communities and Local Government (https://imd-by-

198

postcode.opendatacommunities.org/imd/2019). Scores are given between 1 and 10 and

199

then reduced these scores to give five possible outcomes; very high deprivation (1 and 2),

200

high deprivation (3 and 4), moderate deprivation (5 and 6), low deprivation (7 and 8) and

201

very low deprivation (9 and 10).

202

203

Statistical analysis

204

205

The study analysis plan was registered on Open Science Framework (available at

206

https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E3KDM - section 2.1). Analyses were undertaken using

207

SPSS v.26. Descriptive statistics were used to describe sociodemographic characteristics,

208

wellbeing, changes in physical and mental health, health related behaviours, and whether

209

the person was currently receiving support form mental health services. We planned to test

210

(using multiple regression) whether the cumulative index of harmful behaviours was

211

associated with wellbeing and deterioration in physical or mental health after adjusting for

212

age, gender, minority status, socio-economic deprivation and being seen in secondary care.

Discussion

257

258

In the transdiagnostic study sample of adults with severe mental ill health (N=367) we

259

explored behaviours known to be harmful to health and how these may have changed

260

during the COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to

261

explore health related behaviours in this population. Prior to the pandemic 20.2% of

262

participants reported that they did not take part in physical activity, this is compared to 18%

263

who reported that they did not take part in physical activity during the pandemic. Of those

264

that were physically active during the pandemic 47.5% report that they are doing less than

265

they did prior to the pandemic. This compares to 36.2% of adults in the general population

266

who reported taking part in less physical activity during the pandemic (13). This is a cause for

267

concern in a population with already low baseline levels of physical activity and high levels of

268

sedentary behaviour (21). Furthermore, prior to the pandemic only 4.4% of CtG study

269

participants were meeting government guidelines of five portions of fruit and vegetables per

270

day. During the pandemic 20.4% of people reported eating fewer than before the pandemic.

271

This is a slight improvement over a general population sample (4) that reported 35% of

272

respondents saying they were eating a healthy balanced diet less than before the pandemic.

273

However, it should be borne in mind the low baseline that people with SMI are starting from

274

in terms of fruit and vegetable consumption.

275

276

In terms of smoking, the number of people who reported being smokers during the

277

pandemic was nearly double that of the general population. Twenty seven percent in our

278

sample compared to 14.8% in a general population representative sample (16). However

279

this number has decreased slightly from when participants in the OWLS COVID-19 study

280

were recruited to the CtG cohort (between 2016 and 2020), when the percentage that

281

smoked was 31.4%. Of concern is the fact that of those who do smoke 54.5% were smoking

282

more during the pandemic. More encouragingly, we found that drinking alcohol is of

283

relatively low prevalence amongst our study sample, prior to the pandemic 40.1% of people

284

reported not drinking alcohol compared to 53.7% who reported not drinking alcohol during

285

the pandemic. However, of those that do drink 29.1% were drinking more during the

286

pandemic. These results however should be interpreted with caution as some people in this

287

study are taking medication that contradicts the consumption of alcohol and therefore it

288

may be that some people who drink alcohol did not want to report that they consumed

289

alcohol.

290

291

Over half of the OWLS COVID-19 study sample reported greater levels of behaviours known

292

to be harmful to health during the pandemic restrictions. In particular, they reported

293

smoking more, drinking more, eating less fruit and vegetables or taking part in less physical

294

activity. The majority of people had only one increase in behaviour harmful to health,

295

although just under a third had an increase in two behaviours known to be harmful to

296

health. When we explored associations with behaviours known to be harmful to health we

297

found that a reporting a deterioration in physical health was associated with increased

298

health risk behaviour. However, reporting a deterioration in mental health was not found to

299

be associated with behaviours known to be harmful to health. Socio-demographic factors

300

(BAME, IMDD, gender) were also not found to be associated with behaviours known to be

301

harmful to health. We do not know whether an increase in health risk behaviours led to a

302

deterioration in physical health or whether a deterioration in physical health led to people

303

being less able to take care of themselves, and this relationship is likely to be bidirectional.

304

The relationship between physical health and health related behaviours highlights the

305

importance of developing and maintaining strategies to improve the physical health of

306

people with SMI. In addition, younger age was found to be another predictor of new

307

behaviours known to be harmful to health under the pandemic. This may be explained by a

18

308

number of factors, it could be that older people perceive themselves to be more at risk from

309

COVID-19 and are therefore less likely to adopt additional behaviours known to be harmful

310

to health. Younger people may have been more likely to take part in physical activity, which

311

had to stop as the gyms closed and sports clubs couldn’t meet. Another possibility is that

312

people with SMI who engage in negative health behaviours are more likely to have a shorter

313

life expectancy, and not survive into older age. This could be a manifestation of the healthy

314

survivor phenomenon observed in cohort studies (22).

315

316

This OWLS COVID-19 study has several strengths. First, we report on a group of people who

317

are underrepresented in general population surveys, and yet have some of the highest levels

318

of unmet health needs(23). People were directly approached to take part in this study using

319

a sampling framework that allowed people from a range of demographics to be invited

320

rather than a self-selected group, which is a risk for online surveys and can lead to selection

321

bias. The problem of potentially unrepresentative self-selected samples in COVID-19 studies

322

has been shown to be a particular limitation in mental health research (24). Second, the

323

OWLS COVID-19 study participants had previously been recruited to a large transdiagnostic

324

study of people with SMI, and had consented to be contacted about future research. This

325

allowed us to recruit to the OWLS COVID -19 study rapidly in response the COVID-19

326

pandemic, whilst still using a sampling strategy. This study does however have some

327

weaknesses. First, whilst every effort was made to include the most vulnerable people from

328

what is a vulnerable group we were rarely able to recruit from inpatient settings or people

329

under the care of assertive outreach teams. When potential participants were on an

330

inpatient ward we asked their care team if they could support the person to take part where

331

it was appropriate to do so. Unfortunately there were very few cases where this was

332

possible. We also attempted to include people in community supported living facilities and

333

asked their care team to support them to take part, in some cases this was possible but in

Conclusion

337

338

People with SMI are considered clinically vulnerable, and these concerns predate the COVID-

339

19 pandemic. The results of this study highlight the additional threats to the health of a

340

group of people who already experience profound health inequalities. SMI is listed as an

341

underlying health condition which puts them at greater risk during the COVID-19 pandemic

342

(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-

343

vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-30-december-2020/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-

344

immunisation-advice-on-priority-groups-for-covid-19-vaccination-30-december-2020) and

345

many people with SMI also have co-morbid physical health conditions which are additional

346

risk factors also listed as underlying health conditions, for example diabetes and obesity

347

(25). The results around smoking and exercise are especially concerning, as being a smoker

348

and low levels of physical activity are risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes (26, 27) and

349

smoking is a possible risk factor for greater transmission (28).

350

351

This evidence presented in this paper further emphasises the need for health services that

352

target health risk behaviours, such as smoking, diet and physical exercise, for people with

353

SMI to mitigate these high risks of adverse outcomes in the presence of COVID-19 and in the

354

longer term.
