ABSTRACT
This work explores data on the number of deaths in Brazil since the beginning of the
historical series of IBGE, 2003, together with data for the period 2015-2020 of the
Transparency Portal. The graphs for total deaths, deaths from violence and deaths in
hospitals are discussed. The relationship between them leads to conclusions about the
real dimension of the effect of COVID-19 in Brazilian society during the year 2020 and
its relative importance to other diseases that had a lesser impact. Hypotheses are also
made about the number of deaths in future years.
Keywords: Covid 19; Brazil; National statistics data; epidemics; pandemics.

INTRODUCTION
Since the first case of COVID-19, officially reported in December 2019 [1], in the city of
Wuhan, People's Republic of China, millions of people have been infected worldwide.
Most of these have managed to recover, but unfortunately a significant proportion
have died. In February 2020 the Brazilian federal government declared a national
emergency [2]. The following month, March 2020, the World Health Organization
declared the outbreak a pandemic [3], which was followed by many efforts of all kinds
to prevent its spread and minimize its effects.
Brazil registered, as of March 2020, an increasing number of deaths, besides the
increase that has always been observed since the beginning of the historical series,
registered by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) [4] in 2003, except
in 2005.
In this work we study the historical variation of deaths since the beginning of the
series, in 2003, to try to evaluate the effect that COVID-19 had on the number of
deaths in 2020 and the number that would be expected in the absence of this
pandemic. The series, simultaneously, may be useful in assessing epidemics that have
affected Brazil over these years. In the work, as auxiliary tools, the numbers of deaths
in hospitals and the number of deaths associated to violence throughout Brazil from
2003 to 2019 were also included.
Our study was carried out using public data that are easily accessible to anyone
interested and is therefore easy to reproduce. The sources were IBGE [4] and the Civil
Registry Transparency Portal [5].
The rest of the work is organized as follows: in the DATA section the databases used
for its development are described. In the RESULTS section the graphs on total deaths,
violent deaths and hospital deaths from 2003 to 2020 are presented. Data on deaths
related to other diseases in the years 2019 and 2020 are also presented. In the
DISCUSSION section we analyze the graphs presented in the previous section, as well
as the correlations between them, which allow us to arrive at the CONCLUSIONS
section where the main findings of our work are summarized.

DATA
The data used for the number of deaths in Brazil (total, violent and in hospitals) were
extracted from IBGE. Data from the Transparency Portal on deaths in Brazil from 2015
to 2020 (the only data available) were also used. Regarding the two databases, it is
worth pointing out that in the years that they are included in both databases, the data
do not coincide exactly. Data on deaths in Brazil in 2019 and 2020 due to specific
diseases were also obtained from the Transparency Portal.

RESULTS
In figure 1 we can observe the total number of deaths per year in Brazil from 2003 to
2019 (black circles), obtained from IBGE [4] and the total number of deaths per year in
Brazil from 2015 to 2019 (black triangles), according to data from the Transparency
Portal [5]. Figure 1 also represents the point of intersection of the linear adjustment of
these two sets of data for 2020. The black square is the total number of deaths for
2020, obtained from the Transparency Portal [5].

Figure 1 - Total number of deaths in Brazil between 2003 and 2019. The black circles
correspond to data from IBGE [4] since the beginning of the series in 2003. The blue line is the
linear adjustment and these data. The black triangles represent the data of the Transparency
Portal available [5]. The green line is the linear adjustment to this data. The point of
intersection between the lines corresponds approximately to the extrapolation of both for the
year 2020. The black square is the number of deaths in the Transparency Portal for the year
2020. Note that the two sets of data have years in common, but in which the data do not
coincide. The Transparency Portal is a more recent base and we believe that it will gradually be
completed, so that in the future the slope will be similar to the slope of the linear adjust from
IBGE data. Interestingly, in the graph we observe that as of 2020, without a pandemic, the two
series would coincide. It is normal that large databases only guarantee their data after a
certain time has elapsed. Clear examples of this are the databases of earthquakes and
magnetic storms, among others.

The difference between the two points for 2020 (the intersection point of
extrapolations and the data from the Transparency Portal for the year 2020) should be
observed, which gives the value of 97,287 deaths. If we compare the actual values of
deaths for 2019 and 2020, using the data for 2019 from IBGE and the data for 2020
from the Transparency Portal, the difference is 115,042 deaths. If we use the two
values from the Transparency Portal, the difference is 187,023 deaths.
It is important to point out at this point that, given that the number of deaths by
COVID-19 officially informed on the Transparency Portal [6] until 12/31/2020 was
195,382 [6], the difference between the two values for 2020 (the one extracted from
the Transparency Portal and the one obtained by extrapolating the adjustments for the
years 2003-2019 and 2015-2019), should be of this order. However, the extrapolation
value is approximately half (97,287 deaths) of the registered deaths.
It also draws attention, in IBGE data, to the difference between the years 2015 and
2016 (44,298 deaths), as well as the difference between the years 2009 and 2010
(34,326) and between the years 2010 and 2011 (31,039). Another notable difference
occurred between the years 2005 and 2006 (27,452). It is important seen that the only
decrease in the number of deaths in the historical series was between two consecutive
years, 2004 and 2005 (- 15,839).

Figure 2 - Number of violent deaths in Brazil, between 2003 and 2019. There was a sharp
decrease between the years 2017 and 2019, which led to the minimum of the historical series
so far.

Figure 2 shows the number of violent deaths in Brazil between 2003 and 2019. In this
graph it is worth noting that between 2009 and 2011 the number remained
approximately constant, as well as between 2015 and 2016. Other points that stand
out are those between 2017 and 2019 with a systematic drop in the number of violent
deaths that led to the lowest number in the historical series in 2019.
Figure 3 shows the number of deaths in hospitals from 2003 to 2019. Again, the
differences between 2009 and 2010, and between 2015 and 2016, are highlighted. A
new jump appeared between the years 2005 and 2006.

Figure 3 - Number of deaths registered in hospitals in Brazil between 2003 and 2019. In this
graph, as in figure 1, the differences between the years 2005 and 2006, 2009 and 2010, and
2015 and 2016 are remarkable.

DISCUSSION
The difference between 2019 and 2020, 77,521 deaths, is the largest ever observed in
the historical series (Figure 1). However, observing Figure 2, we can infer that there are
two facts that must have impacted this difference. The first is the number of violent
deaths in 2019, which is the lowest in the historical series, and which may have led to
an increase in the difference in total deaths between the years 2019 and 2020 of the
order of 10,000 deaths. The second, which for the time being is partial [7], is the trend
towards an increase in the number of violent deaths during the year 2020.

From Figure 1 it can be stated with certainty that COVID-19 brought a significant
increase in the number of deaths, far beyond what would be expected by analyzing the
historical series [4,5]. However, some characteristics that are highlighted in Figure 1
appear in Figure 3 (deaths in hospitals). From the behavior of the differences between
the years 2009 and 2010, and between the years 2010 and 2011, it can be inferred that
there was some epidemic that affected the health system in Brazil. We risk that it may
have been the first appearance of H1N1 (but this should be the object of more detailed
studies). Likewise, the difference between the years 2015 and 2016 may be the
signature of another epidemic or epidemics that may have affected Brazil in those
years, such as chikungunya, zica and dengue (but as in the case of H1N1, this should be
the target of more detailed studies). The difference between 2005 and 2006 could
perhaps be related to sporadic appearances of swine fever in that period.
From the comparison of the differences between the years 2010 and 2011, 2015 and
2016 and 2019 and 2020, it can be seen that all of them are of the same order of
magnitude. Therefore, it is to be expected that there were a number of false positives,
as can be observed by the name adopted in the Transparency Portal - Special Covid-19,
in the Registry Panel of summation: "Deaths with suspicion or confirmation of Covid19". It is worth mentioning the decrease registered between the years 2019 and 2020
[6] in the number of deaths from other respiratory diseases (not COVID-19) such as
pneumonia, which fell by 44 413 deaths [6].
However, another plausible hypothesis is that a large part of the deaths that would
occur naturally over 2020 (or even 2021, 2022 and beyond) due to severe
comorbidities have been accelerated by the pandemic. If this hypothesis is correct, a
number of deaths will be verified in 2021 and 2022, below what is expected from the
extrapolation of historical series from 2003 to 2019, shown in Fig. 1. This will obviously
occur with the decrease in the number of deaths by COVID-19 by the use of vaccines,
treatments and obtaining "herd immunity". This decrease could be an indication that
COVID-19 was definitely removed from our coexistence.
The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic brought widespread concern that must
have contributed to the increase in the number of deaths by 2020 compared to 2019.
One example is the increase in SARS deaths of 15044 [6].
One can mention the abandonment by patients of treatment for pre-existing diseases,
suicides and domestic violence, among others. The initial extreme concern must have
been caused by the rapid spread of the disease in populations especially vulnerable to
it (elderly population in European countries), even in places of high human
development. It draws attention to the relatively low morbidity that the virus has
caused in populations of places theoretically less prepared to face this type of disorder
(Africa). But it is also worth mentioning that the African population is, in general and
due to low life expectancy, young. Brazil is not at either extreme.

CONCLUSIONS
The number of deaths in Brazil in 2020, expected by extrapolation of the historical
series 2003-2019 (IBGE) and 2015-2019 (Portal), has increased sharply since the
appearance of COVID-19. The total number of deaths, although representing an
immeasurable human loss, remained in the same order of magnitude as the number of
deaths due, possibly, to other infectious diseases in previous periods. The difference
between the total number of deaths in the years 2019 and 2020 may also be
associated with an increase in the number of violent deaths in 2020. On the other
hand, the number of deaths reported on the Transparency Portal as “Deaths with
suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19” far exceeds the statistical projections
presented in this work, specifically, the difference between the extrapolation of the
historical series of the IBGE and the Portal until 2019, and the data of the Transparency
Portal for 2020, as well as seem to be related to the variation in the number of deaths
due to other respiratory diseases. It would be very interesting to do similar studies for
others countries and eventually to the whole world, to know the actual impact of the
COVID-19 worldwide.
