Outcome of COVID-19 with co-existing surgical emergencies in children: our initial
experiences & recommendations
Abstract:
Background: COVID-19 has changed the practice of surgery vividly all over the world. Pediatric
surgery is not an exception. Prioritization protocols allowing us to provide emergency surgical
care to the children in need while controlling the pandemic spread. The aim of this study is to
share our experiences with the outcome of children with COVID-19 who had a co-existing
surgical emergency.
Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical,
and laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency
department and later diagnosed to have COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The study duration was 3
months (April 2020 – June 2020). A nasopharyngeal swab was taken from all patients
irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT-PCR with the purpose of detecting
asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms. Emergency surgical services were
provided immediately without delay and patients with positive test results were isolated
according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients into 4 age groups for the
convenience of data analysis. Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using
SPSS (version 25) software. Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board.
Results: Total patients were 32. Seven (21.9%) of them were neonates. Twenty-four (75%)
patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception. Only two patients
had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%) patients. Fourteen
(43.8%) patients required surgical treatment. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.5 days.
One neonate with ARM died in the post-operative ward due to cardiac arrest. No patient had
hypoxemia or organ failure. Seven health care workers (5.51%) including doctors & nurses got
infected with SARS Co V2 during this period.
Conclusion: Our study has revealed a milder course of COVID-19 in children with minimal
infectivity even when present in association with emergency surgical conditions. This might
encourage a gradual restart to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on children’s surgery.
Keywords: COVID 19, COVID 19 in children, Children’s Surgery, Surgical emergency,

Introduction:
COVID-19 storm is showing its lethal face around the world and it is still beyond prediction how
long it will continue, and how deadly it could be. Increasingly more people are being affected
and people with co-existing diseases are suffering more.[1] The causative agent severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) spreading rapidly around the world. As of
23rd July more than 15 million people got infected with SARS CoV 2 and more than 6 million
people have lost their lives because of COVID-19.[2]
Fortunately, the infection rate in children is low in comparison to adult and most cases are mild
or asymptomatic. Therefore, a detailed clinical picture of COVID-19 in children is yet to come.
Moreover, presentations of COVID-19 in children are more inconsistent than adults. Only
around 25% of children present with common respiratory symptoms which leads to delay in
diagnosis & treatment and increases the risk of transmission.[3-6]
As an effort to control the rapid transmission, governments & organizations around the world
have implemented distancing strategies. To comply with this strategy, healthcare institutions
have taken several measures like discouraging hospital visits for non-emergency problems,
prioritization, and re-scheduling health problems according to their time sensitivity. Pediatric
surgical service is also not an exception. Different hospitals and associations have formalized
protocols to ensure essential surgical service for children in need and at the same time to limit
the spread of the virus and also to protect the health care workers.[7-10]
At the beginning of the outbreak of SARS CoV 2 in March in our country, we have also canceled
all routine surgeries for children and been performing only emergency surgeries to limit the
spread of the SARS CoV 2. The study aims to illustrate the outcomes we observed in children
with COVID-19 who had co-existing surgical emergencies.

Methods:
This is a retrospective observational study. We reviewed the epidemiological, clinical, and
laboratory data of all patients admitted in our surgery department through the emergency

department and later diagnosed to have COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The study duration was 3
months (April 2020 – June 2020).
In this study period, only children with emergency symptoms were admitted. A nasopharyngeal
swab was taken from all patients irrespective of symptoms to detect SARS CoV 2 by RT-PCR
with the purpose of detecting asymptomatic patients and patients with atypical symptoms.
Emergency surgical services were provided immediately without delay and patients with positive
test results were isolated according to the hospital protocol. We divided the test positive patients
into 4 age groups for the convenience of data analysis.
Data were retrieved from hospital records and analyzed using SPSS (version 25) software.
Ethical permission was taken from the hospital ethical review board.

Results:
Total 32 children were tested positive for SARS CoV 2 by RT-PCR. Seven (21.9%) of them
were neonates (Table 1). The smallest one tested positive was 3 days old. Twenty-four (75%)
patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was acute abdomen followed by infantile
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), myelomeningocele, and intussusception (Figure 1). Only 2
patients had mild respiratory symptoms (dry cough). Fever was present in 13 (40.6%)
patients.[Supplemental material]

Discussion:
COVID-19 has changed the way of surgical practice globally. This is a critical and
unprecedented period, but efforts are being made to ensure inevitable emergency surgical care.
The system is also adapting itself as more evidence is being generated.[7-11] From the beginning
of the outbreak in our country, we have adopted the protocol to continue only the emergency
admission at our department and try conservative treatment approaches.
More than 20 % of our patients were neonates. The mode of transmission in these patients was
not transparent. This might be due to the parents’ tendency to hide history or reluctance to test
when asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Vertical transmission of SARS CoV2 from mother
to baby is not been proven yet. An increased level of virus-specific IgM has been reported in
neonates of the infected mother, but this remains inconclusive due to the high rate of false
positivity. Transmission through breast milk has also not been confirmed. Breast milk samples of
mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia have been tested negative for SARS CoV 2.[12] These
reports raise the suspicion of nosocomial transmission to neonates.

Two third of the children were male. It is not clear that the lower incidence of COVID-19 in
women is also applicable to female children. Studies suggested that immune regulatory proteins
encoded by the X chromosome cause less viral load and inflammation in females than male.[13]
The most common presentation was with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Six patients presented
with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain & several episodes of non-bilious vomiting.
Laboratory investigations did not reveal any abnormality rather RT-PCR for SARS Co V2 came
positive. One of them had radiological evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-ray. No
one had respiratory symptoms. All of them improved with conservative treatment. GI symptoms
have been reported in up to 10% of COVID-19 patients.[14] A viral infection is the cause of
around 50% of intussusceptions in children. COVID-19 has also been reported to cause
intussusception in children, and pediatric surgeons in an epidemic area should be aware of
this.[15-16]
Surgical treatment was required in 14 (43.8%) patients. Others improved with conservative
treatment. The personal protective equipment of caregivers was not standard; despite the fact that
only seven of the caregivers got COVID-19 during this period. However, it was not certain
whether they got the infection from the hospital or outside. Fortunately, all of them improved
without complications. The evidence available to date does not support a “child to adult”
transmission of SARS Co V2.[17-18]
The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.53±1.58 days. No patient had hypoxemia or organ
failure. Therefore, intensive care support was not required. This is due to the milder course of
COVID-19 even with co-existing surgical emergencies. This finding supports the most published
series of COVID-19 in children though serious infection and even death have also been reported
in children.[3-6] This might be due to variable viral strains in this region or dissimilar immune
responses to it.
Rescheduling of the non-emergent cases has already caused an enormous burden on the health
care system. It is still not clear how long this critical period will go on. To reduce the sufferings
of children with surgical needs, a gradual restart of scheduled surgeries is necessary considering
the low transmissibility of COVID-19 in children.
Conclusions:
COVID-19 has made the world standstill. It is taking a toll on civilization. Fortunately, it is
sparing the children so far but the impact on children's surgery is already huge. Our study has
shown the milder course of the disease even with a co-existing surgical emergency in children.
The transmission of the disease from children to health care workers was also low. This might
encourage the pediatric surgeons around the world for a gradual restart.
