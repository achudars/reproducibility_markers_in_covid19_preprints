Abstract:
False negative outcome of a diagnosis is one the major reasons for the dissemination of the diseases
with high risk of propagation. Diagnostic sensitivity and the margin of error determine the false
negative outcome of the diagnosis. A mathematical model had been developed to estimate the
mean % secondary infections based on the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity, % prevalence
and R0 value. This model recommends a diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity ≥ 96% and at least
92% lower bound limit of the 95% CI or ≤ 4% margin of error for a highly infectious diseases like
COVID-19 to curb the secondary transmission of the infection due to false negative cases. Positive
relationship was found between mean % secondary infection and margin of error of sensitivity
suggesting greater the margin of error of a diagnostic test sensitivity, higher the number of
secondary infections in a population due to false negative cases. Negative correlation was found
between number of COVID-19 test kits (>90% sensitivity) with regulatory approval and margin of
error (R= -0.92, p=0.023) suggesting lesser the margin of error of a diagnostic test, higher the
chances of getting approved by the regulatory agencies. However, there are no specific regulatory
standards available for margin of error of the diagnostic sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnostic tests.
Highly infectious disease such as COVID-19, certainly need specific regulatory standards on margin of
error or 95% CI of the diagnostic sensitivity to curb the dissemination of the disease due to false
negative cases and our model can be used to set the standards such as sensitivity, margin of error or
lower bound limit of 95% CI.

1.Introduction
A perfect diagnostic test does not exist in real life and therefore diagnostic procedures can make
only partial distinction between subjects with and without disease (Simundic, 2009). Diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test are the metrices generally considered to assess the
performance of the test in the real world or clinical condition. Sensitivity defines the proportion of
true positive subjects with the disease in a total group of subjects with the disease and specificity
defines proportion of subjects without the disease with negative test result in total of subjects
without disease (Simundic, 2009). Among the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, diagnostic
sensitivity of a test is very critical in diagnosis of infectious diseases with high risk of propagation as
false negative results could facilitate the community transmission of infectious diseases such as
COVID-19. The precision of diagnostic sensitivity is also an important factor in the diagnosis of highly
infectious diseases which is determined by 95% confidence interval (CI). Narrower the 95% CI
interval, higher the precision of the diagnostic test. An ideal diagnostic test would have highest
sensitivity and specificity with very narrow 95% CI which hardly exist in the real world. However, a
test with diagnostic sensitivity close to 100% and very narrow 95% CI is need of the hour for the
infectious disease such as COVID-19 with basic reproduction number (R0) greater than one. R0 is
defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infection in a
completely susceptible population and If the mean R0 > 1, the infection will spread exponentially. R0
estimates for SARS virus infections have been reported to range between 2 and 5. The R0 value of
SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early period of outbreak in China was estimated to be about 2.0 (Liu
et al., 2020a) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate of R0 value was 1.95 (1.4-2.5)
(WHO, 2020). The recent studies claimed that the mean R0 value of COVID-19 disease had been
estimated to be 3.28 (Liu et al., 2020b) and the recently mutated SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage has R0
value higher than the previous lineages. Higher the diagnostic sensitivity and narrower the 95% CI
together churn out less false negative results and help in curbing the community transmission of
highly infectious diseases with pandemic potential. A 95% CI is a range of values that can be 95%
certain contains the true mean of the population and one can be 95% confident that the true
population parameter is between the lower and upper limit values. US-FDA recommended that
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of all the tests to be reported with 95 % CI (FDA, 2011; Hess et
al., 2012). The confidence interval range of a diagnostic test can be simply summarised in a number
as Margin of Error (M) which will help the clinicians to easily understand the precision of the

diagnostic test. The margin of error is simply one-half the width of the confidence interval, i.e.
(Upper limit − Lower limit)/2 (Hess et al., 2012). Lower the margin of error of the diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity, higher the precision of the diagnostic test.

There is no commonly

accepted standard for how small the margin of error should be for diagnostic test. In most of the
social science studies a margin of error < 5% is the acceptable limit, but no such published or
regulatory guidelines exists for the diagnostic tests used in the veterinary and medical practice
(Royse, 2008; Sullivan, 2008; Royse et al., 2010). Though smaller margin of error are preferred for
any diagnostic test, diagnostic test intended for the highly infectious diseases with R0>1 needs
specific recommendation from the regulatory agencies to restrict the rapid spread of the disease.
Sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test may vary with the prevalence of disease in a population
in which higher the prevalence of disease, higher the sensitivity and lower the specificity of the
diagnostic test (Leeflang et al., 2013). A mathematical model had been developed to estimate the
mean % secondary infections based on the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity, % prevalence
and R0 value which can be used to set norms for diagnostic tests intended for diseases with high risk
of propagation. This paper also discusses the role of diagnostic sensitivity and margin of error in the
risk of propagation of the diseases with R0 > 1 and emphasis the need to consider the margin of error
of a diagnostic sensitivity of a diagnostic test as one of the parameters while approving the
diagnostic tests associated with high risk of disease propagation.

2.Materials and Methods
2.1. Mathematical model to estimate the mean secondary infection in relation to diagnostic
sensitivity and margin of error
The false negative cases are the persons carrying the infection but failed to be detected by the
diagnostic test. Unlike false positive cases, the false negative cases carrying highly infectious
pathogens such as COVID-19 virus could potentially act as community spreaders and source of
secondary infections (Fig.1). If the R0 value is 2.0, every false negative person can potentially
transmit the virus to 2 persons in a population. The mean % secondary infections related with the %
false negative cases were estimated using a customised formula. The range of sensitivity in
increment of one corresponding to the margin of error and length of range were kept as variable.
The R0 value and % prevalence values were kept as constants. The R0 value was kept as 2.0 in this
formula as R0 value of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020; Liu et al 2020a). Percentage prevalence of COVID-19
was assigned as 10% (0.10) as the mean weekly COVID-19 positive in USA was 9.6% (5%- 22%) (CDC,
2020). Mean % secondary infection due to false negative results was estimated for the diagnostic
tests with sensitivity of 100%, 99%,98%,97%,96%,95% and 90% with margin of error ranging from 1%

The range of 95% CI was taken as simple number range (i.e., 94%-96%) where the lower bound and
upper bound limits are 94% and 96%, respectively. The % secondary infections were calculated for
the given 95% CI (94%-96%) by subtracting the lower limit value (x =94%) from 100% sensitivity and

multiplied by % prevalence (0.10) and the product finally multiplied by R0 value [(100-94) X 0.10 X

the diagnostic test with 95% sensitivity (95% CI, 94%-96%) in three random populations is estimated
to be 1.0 [(1.2+1.0+0.8)/3]. This model assumes that a diagnostic test with 95% diagnostic sensitivity

with margin of error 1 (95% CI, 94%-96%) could facilitate the spread of an infectious disease (R0=2.0)
up to 1% of the population as secondary infection due to false negative results. A diagnostic test
with low false negative outcome which could spread an infectious disease such as COVID-19 to < 1%
of the population is an ideal one.

2.2. COVID-19 diagnostics data
The data on antibody, antigen and Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) based COVID-19 diagnostic
kits, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the kits, margin of error and regulatory approval status
of the COVID-19 diagnostic kits were obtained from finddx.com. The total number of antibody,
antigen and NAAT based COVID-19 diagnostic kits with complete data set, kits with diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%, margin of error of the diagnostic kits and list of COVID19 diagnostic kits with regulatory approvals were obtained from finddx.com on 30th November 2020.
The antibody and NAAT based COVID-19 diagnostic test kits with both diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity greater than 90% were categorized based on the margin of error values.
2.3. Statistical analysis
The data generated from the model and the COVID-19 diagnostics data obtained from finddx.com
were analysed by R-software R-4.0.2, GraphPad prism 7.0 and MS excel. Pearson correlation
coefficient and coefficient of determination between the margin of error and mean % secondary
infections were calculated and line plot was plotted. Pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient
of determination between the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and number of
COVID-19 diagnostic kits approved by regulatory agencies with varying margin of error were
calculated. Linear regression analysis of interval-valued data such as range of margin or error and
number of approved kits in each range of margin of error was calculated using the upper, lower and
midpoint values of the margin of error range (de Carvalho, et al., 2004)

where there is no herd immunity to the disease. The model suggests that diagnostic tests with
sensitivity ≥ 96% with margin of error ≤ 4, could be an ideal test with low false negative outcome
that could spread the disease with R0 value 2 and 10% prevalence to less than 1% of the population
as secondary infection (Table. 1). A diagnostic test with risk of propagation of disease to less than 1%
of population is expected to curb the spread of disease. Hence, less than 1% mean secondary
infection was considered as the cut-off value to determine the diagnostic sensitivity, 95% CI and
margin of error. The R software programme can be used to calculate the mean % secondary
infection for any variable diagnostic sensitivity range, R0 values and % prevalence ranges.
Positive correlation was found between mean % secondary infection and margin of error (R=1.0,
p=0.0001 (sensitivity 100%); R=0.94, p=0.00005 (sensitivity 95%)) suggesting greater the margin of
error of a diagnostic test sensitivity, higher the number of secondary infections in a population due
to false negative cases (Table. 1) (Fig.2).
This model recommends a diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity ≥ 96% and at least 92% lower
bound limit of the 95% CI or ≤ 4% margin of error for highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 to curb
the secondary transmission of the infection due to false negative cases. (Fig. 3). The recommended
sensitivity and margin of error of a diagnostic test will change in accordance with the R0 value and %
prevalence. Higher the R0 value and % prevalence of the disease, we need to have a diagnostic test
with higher sensitivity and narrow 95% CI or lower margin of error. High reproduction rate number
and prevalence of an infectious disease are expected to drive the spread the disease to a greater
number of people in a population and need a diagnostic test with highest sensitivity and lowest
margin of error to prevent the secondary spread of the disease due to false negative outcome.
3.2. Approved COVID-19 test kits with margin of error data
Among 73,131 and 6 number of NAAT based, antibody based and antigen based COVID-19 diagnostic
kits, respectively listed in the finddx.com, only 41, 32 and 5 number of kits, respectively were
available with complete data set including the 95% CI of sensitivity and specificity. NAAT based,
antibody based and antigen based COVID-19 diagnostic kits with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity
greater than 90% were 29, 13 and 1, respectively (Table.2).
The number of COVID-19 test kits with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity greater than 90% with
varying margin of error were binned into 6 different margin of error intervals (1%-50%). The number
of COVID-19 test kits falling under different range of margin error were listed in Table.2. The number
of NAAT based, antibody based and antigen based COVID-19 diagnostic kits with less than 5% margin
of error and >90% sensitivity was 10, 7 and 0, respectively. The number of NAAT based, antibody

based and antigen based COVID-19 diagnostic kits with less than 5% margin of error and >90%
specificity was 11, 10 and 2, respectively (Table. 2).
3.3. Negative correlation between the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity and regulatory
approval of COVID-19 test kits
The number of approved NAAT and antibody based COVID-19 diagnostic kits with >90% sensitivity
and specificity binned into 6 different margin of error intervals, were subjected to linear regression
analysis. Negative correlation was found between number of COVID-19 test kits (>90% sensitivity)
with regulatory approval and margin of error (R= -0.92, p=0.023) suggesting lesser the margin of
error of a diagnostic test, higher the chances of getting approved by the regulatory agencies (Table.

3) (Fig.4). The margin of error explained 85% variation in the regulatory approval process of the
COVID-19 test kits (R2=0.85, p=0.023) suggesting the regulatory agencies such as US-FDA, CE-mark
(EU), Health Canada, Australia TGA and Singapore HAS and Brazil ANVISA considering margin of error
or 95% CI while approving the COVID-19 test kits. Though negative correlation was found between
number of COVID-19 test kits (>90% specificity) with regulatory approval and margin of error (R= 0.70, p=0.188), it was not statistically significant (Table. 3) (Fig.4).

4. Discussion
Diagnostic tests for highly infectious diseases with low sensitivity and wider 95% CI or high margin of
error are expected to yield more false negative results which could lead to rapid spread of the
infections in community. A systematic review of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests reported false
negative rates of between 2% and 29% (equating to sensitivity of 71-98%), based on negative RT-PCR
tests which were positive on repeat testing (Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., 2020). A person diagnosed
negative for the infectious disease but actually carrying the infectious agent moving freely in the
population and allowed to fly all over the world thus unwittingly transmitting the disease agent.
Individuals with false negative results tend to relax physical distancing, wearing PPE and other
personal measures designed to reduce the transmission of the virus to others (West et al., 2020)
thus facilitate dissemination of the disease. Even diagnostic tests with perfect sensitivity but wider
95% CI or high margin of error could yield a greater number of false negative outcomes and that
would facilitate the community transmission of the disease. Thus, margin of error of the diagnostic
sensitivity of the test is an important parameter as the diagnostic sensitivity of the test.
Though it is well known that the person with false negative test result could act as a silent carrier of
the infection and spread the infection, there are no study or model to show the relationship

between margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity which led to false negative outcome and secondary
spread of the infection. Our model suggests the importance of margin of error of the diagnostic
sensitivity in spreading the diseases through the false negative outcome which needs to be validated
in field condition.
Though there are regulatory standards on 95% CI or margin of error for the influenza virus diagnosis,
currently no regulatory standards on 95% CI or margin of error for the diagnostic sensitivity of
COVID-19 diagnostics. FDA considers the observed sensitivity and specificity and their respective
95% lower confidence bounds as part of device performance. As per FDA regulations, the sensitivity
for the device testing for influenza A virus must be at least 90 % with a lower bound of the 95 % CI
greater than or equal to 80%. The sensitivity for the device testing for influenza B virus must be at
least 80 % with a lower bound of the 95 % CI greater than or equal to 70 percent (FDA, 2020). The
model used by FDA to estimate the recommended sensitivity and 95% CI is not known. Our model
recommends a diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity ≥ 96% and at least 92% lower bound limit of
the 95% CI or ≤ 4% margin of error for highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 to curb the secondary
transmission of the infection due to false negative cases. This recommendation is based on the cut
off value of risk of propagation of disease to less than 1% of population. This model can also be used
as a base to arrive at the 95% CI or margin of error of the diagnostic sensitivity of other infectious
diseases with known R0 value or based on a presumptive R0 value and % prevalence of the disease.
A random population of varying sizes need to be tested to find out the best lower bound of 95% CI
or margin of error of the diagnostic test (Russek-Cohen et al., 2011). The width of the 95% CI or
margin of error based on a random sample will vary randomly and the 95% CI or margin of error may
not always give an idea of the population parameter (Hazra, 2017). However, diagnostic tests
intended for the diagnosis of highly infectious diseases with high risk of propagation such as COVID19 need stringent regulatory standards for pre- and post-market approval.
The negative correlation between the margin of error value of diagnostic sensitivity and number of
approved COVID-19 kits suggestes that margin of error or 95% CI of the diagnostic sensitivity is
considered by that the regulatory agencies while approving the test kits. Though majority of
approved COVID-19 test kits fell under less than 5% margin of error of sensitivity category, several
approved kits with margin of error range 5% to 40% were also found and clearly suggests the lack of
regulatory standards on the margin of error or 95% CI of diagnostic sensitivity/specificity of COVID19 test kits.
The regulatory approval of a diagnostic test intended for highly infectious disease such as COVID-19
should not only based on the sensitivity and specificity criteria, but also be based on the 95% CI or

the margin of error as a diagnostic test with perfect sensitivity and wider 95% CI or high margin of
error could lead to lot of false negative results which in turn facilitate the rapid spread of the
diseases.

5. Conclusion
A mathematical model had been developed to estimate the mean % secondary infections based on
the margin of error of diagnostic sensitivity, % prevalence and R0 value. This model recommends a
diagnostic test with diagnostic sensitivity ≥ 96% and at least 92% lower bound limit of the 95% CI or
≤ 4% margin of error for highly infectious diseases like COVID-19. Positive correlation was found
between the estimated mean % of secondary infection and margin of error and increase in margin of
error of a diagnostic test would lead to rapid disease transmission due to false negative cases.
Negative correlation was found between the number of COVID-19 diagnostic kits approved by
regulatory agencies and margin of error of the test kits suggesting the chance of regulatory approval
for a COVID-19 kits is higher when the margin of error is low. Though it is evident that margin of
error or 95% CI plays a role in regulatory approval of a COVID-19 test kits, the norms and
mathematical models followed by the regulatory agencies were not available. For COVID-19 like
highly infectious disease with high risk of propagation certainly need specific regulatory standards on
margin of error or 95% CI of the diagnostic sensitivity to curb the transmission of the disease due to
false negative cases.
