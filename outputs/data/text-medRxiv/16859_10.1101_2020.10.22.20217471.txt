Background: BCG vaccination is known to induce innate immune memory, which confers
protection against heterologous infections. However, the effect of BCG vaccination on the
conventional innate and adaptive immune cells subsets is not well characterized.
Methods: We investigated the impact of BCG vaccination on the frequencies of T cell, B cell,
monocyte and dendritic cell subsets as well as total antibody levels in a group of healthy elderly
individuals (age 60-80 years) at one month post vaccination as part of our clinical study to
examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19.
Results: Our results demonstrate that BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central
and effector memory CD4+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naïve, transitional memory,
stem cell memory CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells. In addition, BCG vaccination induced
enhanced frequencies of central, effector and terminal effector memory CD8+ T cells and
diminished frequencies of naïve, transitional memory and stem cell memory CD8+T cells. BCG
vaccination also induced enhanced frequencies of immature, classical and activated memory B
cells and plasma cells and diminished frequencies of naïve and atypical memory B cells. While
BCG vaccination did not induce significant alterations in monocytes subsets, it induced
increased frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs. Finally, BCG vaccination resulted in
elevated levels of all antibody isotypes.
Conclusions: BCG vaccination was associated with enhanced innate and adaptive memory cell
subsets, as well as total antibody levels in elderly individuals, suggesting its potential utility in
SARS-Cov2 infection by enhancing heterologous immunity.

Introduction
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a live – attenuated vaccine strain of Myobacterium

63

bovis that provides protection against mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis and leprosy

64

and was first introduced in 1921 (1, 2). In addition to protective immunity to mycobacterial

65

infections, BCG is also known to protect against heterologous infections (the so-called off-target

66

or non – specific effects) (3, 4). Several epidemiological studies have shown a reduction in

67

childhood mortality in BCG vaccinated children as well as lower incidence of respiratory

68

infections (5-9). In addition, randomized controlled trials have shown that BCG vaccination

69

protects against childhood mortality mainly by providing protection against neonatal sepsis and

70

respiratory infections (10-12). The effect of BCG vaccination in protecting against heterologous

71

infections in adults and more specifically, elderly individuals is less well studied.

72

Two types of immune mechanisms have been postulated to explain this off-target or non

73

– specific effect of BCG against infections. First, BCG is known to induce CD4+ and CD8+

74

memory T cells in an antigen-independent manner but cytokine-dependent manner, and this

75

process is termed heterologous immunity (13-16). Second, BCG is known to induce a process

76

called trained immunity or innate immune memory in innate cells, especially monocytes and NK

77

cells, such that these cells can respond more actively to secondary or bystander infections (17,

78

18). However, whether these mechanisms are operational in elderly individuals, who are at

79

higher risk for infections due to waning immunity is not known.

80

Hence, we examined the induction of T cell, B cell, monocyte, and dendritic cell subsets

81

in response to BCG vaccination in elderly individuals at baseline and one-month post-

82

vaccination along with baseline frequencies in unvaccinated individuals. We also examined the

83

levels of antibody isotypes following vaccination. We demonstrate that BCG vaccination induces

84

significantly enhanced memory T and B cell responses and increased frequencies of DC subsets,

85

as well as total antibody levels, suggesting that BCG can potentially boost immune responses in

86

a non -specific or off-target manner in these elderly individuals.

Study population

89

The demographics of the study population are shown in Table I. From July 2020 through

90

September 2020, 86 individuals were enrolled in the study with 54 in the vaccinated arm and 32

91

in the unvaccinated arm. All the vaccinated individuals were followed up at month 1 post-

92

vaccination with no loss to follow-up. Median age was 65 (Range: 60-78) years in BCG

93

vaccinated group and 63 years (Range: 60-80) in the unvaccinated group. There were 34 males

94

and 20 females in the BCG vaccinated and 15 males and 17 females in unvaccinated group. In

95

the enrolled population, 26% of BCG vaccinated and 15% of unvaccinated individuals had

96

diabetes mellitus while 15% and 9% had cardiovascular disease respectively. In our cohort 4%-

97

6% were current smokers and there were 6% were alcoholics. Other baseline characteristics were

98

similar between the two arms.

To assess the ex vivo phenotype of CD4+ T cell subsets following BCG vaccination, we

103

compared the subsets at baseline or before BCG vaccination (M0) and at month 1 (M1) post-

104

vaccination. As shown in Figure 1A, the frequencies of central and effector memory CD4+ T cell

compared to M0. Next, we compared the frequencies of CD4+ T cell subsets in post-vaccinated

108

individuals to unvaccinated controls. As shown in Figure 1B, BCG vaccinated individuals

109

exhibited increased frequencies of only central memory CD4+ T cells and decreased frequencies

110

of naïve, effector memory, transitional memory, stem cell memory, and regulatory CD4+ T cells.

vaccination. As shown in Figure 2A, the frequencies of central, effector, and terminal effector

121

memory CD8+ T cell subsets were significantly enhanced and the frequencies of naïve,

122

transitional, and stem cell memory CD8+ T cells were significantly diminished at M1 compared

123

to M0. Next, we compared the frequencies of CD8+ T cell subsets in post-vaccinated individuals

124

to unvaccinated controls. As shown in Figure 2B, BCG vaccinated individuals exhibited

125

increased frequencies of central memory, effector memory, and terminal effector memory CD8+

cells. A representative flow cytometry plot showing the gating strategy for CD8+ T cell subsets

BCG vaccination induces enhanced frequencies of immature, classical memory and

134

To assess the ex vivo phenotype of B cell subsets following BCG vaccination, we

135

compared the subsets at baseline or before BCG vaccination (M0) and at month 1 (M1) post-

136

vaccination. As shown in Figure 3A, the frequencies of immature, classical memory and

154

unvaccinated controls. As shown in Figure 3B, BCG vaccinated individuals exhibited increased

155

frequencies of only intermediate monocytes in comparison to unvaccinated controls. A

156

representative flow cytometry plot showing the gating strategy for monocyte subsets is shown in

157

S. Figure 3. Thus, BCG vaccination does not induce any significant alterations in the frequencies

158

of monocyte subsets in elderly individuals.

159

To assess the ex vivo phenotype of DC subsets following BCG vaccination, we compared

160

the subsets at baseline or before BCG vaccination (M0) and at month 1 (M1) post-vaccination.

161

As shown in Figure 5A, the frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs were significantly

162

increased at M1 compared to M0 in BCG vaccinated individuals. Next, we compared the

163

frequencies of DC subsets in post-vaccinated individuals to unvaccinated controls. As shown in

164

Figure 5B, BCG vaccinated individuals exhibited increased frequencies of only both myeloid

165

and plasmacytoid DCs in comparison to unvaccinated controls. A representative flow cytometry

166

plot showing the gating strategy for DC subsets is shown in S. Figure 3. Thus, BCG vaccination-

167

induces enhanced frequencies of DC subsets in elderly individuals.

168

BCG vaccination induces increased levels of total IgG subtypes, IgA and IgM

169

To assess the levels of humoral responses induced by BCG vaccination, we measured

170

IgG subtypes (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), IgA, and IgM in BCG vaccinated individuals at baseline

171

(M0) and month 1 (M1) following BCG vaccination. As shown in Figure 6, BCG vaccination

172

induces significantly increased levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgM at M1 compared

173

to M0. Therefore, BCG is a potent inducer of all antibody isotypes in elderly individuals.

174

Discussion

175

Typically, elderly individuals are at high risk of infectious diseases. In the context of

176

COVID-19 disease, elderly individuals are one of the main target groups for morbidity and

177

mortality. Several clinical trials are currently underway to examine the effect of BCG

178

vaccination in protecting health care workers and other individuals from SARS-CoV2 infection

179

or disease (19-22). Very few studies are examining the protective effect of BCG vaccination

180

against SARS-CoV2 in elderly individuals (21). The study to evaluate the effectiveness of the

181

BCG vaccine in reducing morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals in COVID-19 hotspots

182

in India undertaken by the Indian Council of Medical Research is one such study. As part of the

183

study protocol, we examined the immune responses engendered by BCG vaccination in a group

184

of elderly individuals. Previous studies in elderly individuals have shown that BCG vaccination

185

protected against respiratory infections in Indonesia, Japan, and Europe (23-25).

186

Memory T cells are important in providing vaccine-induced protection against infections

187

in elderly individuals (26). Memory CD4+ T cells induced by vaccination, especially central and

188

effector memory CD4+ T cells, are involved in preventing varicella-zoster reactivation in older

189

individuals (27, 28). Memory CD8+ T cells induced by vaccination, mainly central and effector

190

memory CD8+ T cells, are involved in providing immunity against viral pathogens such as

191

influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (29-32). While other CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell

192

subsets, including transitional memory, terminal effector memory, and stem cell memory

193

subsets, have been postulated to play a role in infection and cancer (33-35), their exact role in

194

vaccine-elicited human immune responses is still unclear. However, induction of vaccine-

195

induced T cell responses is clearly impaired in elderly individuals (26). One potential mechanism

196

is the expansion of regulatory CD4+ T cells, which are known to down modulate effector T cell

197

responses against pathogens (36).

198

Our study clearly demonstrates the increased frequencies of both CD4+ and CD8+

199

central and effector memory T cells. In addition, terminal effector CD8+ T cell memory

200

frequencies are also increased. This is associated with a decrease in the other CD4+ and CD8+ T

201

cell subsets. Therefore, the heightened frequency of the central and effector memory T cell

202

compartment signifies a potential impact on the heterologous immunity and suggests that non-

203

specific or bystander infections are more likely to be protected against in BCG vaccinated

204

individuals. These data fit very well with the recent finding that BCG vaccination in elderly

205

patients was associated with increased time to first infection and protection against viral

206

respiratory pathogens (23). Moreover, BCG vaccination also diminishes the frequency of

207

regulatory T cells and could therefore potentially blunt or ameliorate the regulatory effects of

208

these cells in down modulating protective immune responses.

209

Most of the current vaccines rely on the induction of protective antibodies through the

210

expansion of memory B cells and plasma cells. Memory B cells can be classified as classical

211

memory, activated memory, and atypical memory B cells (37). While classical and activated

212

memory B cells are important for the production of high affinity and broadly neutralizing

213

antibodies (38), atypical memory B cells are exhausted B cells and fail to engender antibody

214

production (39). Long-lived circulating plasma cells are the major source of vaccine-induced

215

antibody production (40). Thus, our data demonstrate that BCG vaccination is likely to have

216

major effects on the humoral immune response as it induces elevated frequencies of all major

217

subsets of antibody-producing and antibody competent B cells. Our data also supports another

218

mechanism for the off-target or non – specific effect of BCG vaccination, which is its ability to

219

cause expansion of memory B cells and plasma cells. Indeed, the examination of different

220

antibody isotypes reveals the presence of enhanced levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA and

221

IgM, indicating that humoral responses are significantly induced by BCG vaccination.

222

BCG vaccination is known to induce trained immunity or innate memory, mainly by

223

inducing epigenetic modification of monocytes and enhancing their ability to mount cytokine

224

responses to secondary pathogens (18). Our data show that BCG vaccination did not significantly

225

modulate the frequencies of monocyte subsets in vaccinated individuals. Thus, the effect of BCG

9

226

on monocyte responses is unlikely to involve monocyte subset alterations. Activating the

227

adaptive immune response requires the presentation of antigens to T cells by DC and

228

macrophages (41). Delays in activation of DC could often result in a delay in the induction of the

229

adaptive immune response to pathogens. Thus, methods to either increase the frequencies of DCs

230

or to activate DCs would improve the protective efficacy of vaccines (42). Our data showing

231

elevated frequencies of both mDC and pDC thus clearly illustrate an important effect of BCG

232

vaccination in enhancing the innate immune response to both specific and non-specific

233

pathogens (possibly) in elderly individuals. Moreover, while mDC is mainly involved in the

234

process of antigen – presentation (43), pDC is the main source of Type 1 interferons in the host

235

(44). Thus, it is potentially likely that increased frequencies of pDC might heighten the

236

propensity of pDC to mount Type I IFN responses against pathogens encountered.

237

In summary, our study highlights the effect of BCG vaccination in modulating the

238

frequencies of both innate and adaptive immune cell subsets. Our study also reveals an effect of

239

BCG in inducing heightened total antibody levels. Although our study did not examine the

240

functional effects of these changes in the immune system, our data nevertheless reveal an

241

important role for BCG vaccination in boosting immune responses in the elderly population.

242

Whether this translates to improved protective immunity to non – specific infections like SARS-

243

CoV2 remains to be determined.

Phenotyping of DC was performed using antibodies directed against HLA- DR, lineage cocktail

290

(CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, CD56) FITC CD123-PE (clone 9F5; BD) CD11c- APC.

291

Plasmacytoid DCs were classified as (Lin– HLA-DR+ CD123+) and myeloid DCs (Lin– HLA-

292

DR+ CD11c+). Monocyte phenotyping was performed using antibodies directed against CD45-

293

PerCP, CD14-Pacific Blue, HLA-DR-PE-Cy7 (clone L243; BD), and CD16-APC- Cy7.

294

Classical monocytes were classified as CD45+ HLA-DR+ CD14hi CD16-; intermediate

295

monocytes as CD45+ HLA-DR+ CD14hi CD16dim and non-classical monocytes were classified

296

as CD45+ HLA- DR+CD14dimCD16hi. Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature

297

erythrocytes were lysed using 2 ml of FACS lysing solution (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), and

cells were washed twice with 2 ml of 1XPBS and suspended in 200 µl of PBS (Lonza,

299

Walkersville, MD). Eight- color flow cytometry was performed on a FACS Canto II flow

300

cytometer with FACSDIVA software, version 6 (Becton Dickinson). The gating was set by

301

forward and side scatter, and 100 000 gated events were acquired. Data were collected and

302

analyzed using FLOW JO software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). Leukocytes were gated using CD45

303

expression versus side scatter (46, 47).

304

Antibody Isotyping

305

Circulating plasma levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgM were measured using

306

Human Isotyping Assays (Bio-Rad-Bio-Plex ProTM) ELISA kits according to manufacturer’s

307

instruction.

308

Statistical analysis

309

Geometric means (GM) were used for measurements of central tendency. Wilcoxon signed-rank

310

test was used to compare frequencies of immune subsets in the BCG vaccinated group at month

311

0 (M0) and month 1 (M1). Statistically significant differences between unvaccinated and BCG

312

vaccinate M1 groups were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. Analyses were performed

313

using Graph-Pad PRISM Version 8.0.
