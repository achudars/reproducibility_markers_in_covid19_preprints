Abstract:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection resulting in the
clinical syndrome COVID-19 is associated with an exaggerated immune response and
monocyte infiltrates in the lungs and other peripheral tissues. It is now increasingly
recognised that chronic morbidity persists in some patients. We recently demonstrated
profound alterations of monocytes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. It is currently unclear
whether these abnormalities resolve or progress following patient discharge. We show here
that blood monocytes in convalescent patients at their 12 week follow up, have a greater
propensity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6, which was consistently
higher in patients with resolution of lung injury as indicated by a normal chest X-ray and no
shortness of breath (a key symptom of lung injury). Furthermore, monocytes from
convalescent patients also displayed enhanced levels of molecules involved in leucocyte
migration, including chemokine receptor CXCR6, adhesion molecule CD31/PECAM and
integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1. Expression of migration molecules on monocytes was also
consistently higher in convalescent patients with a normal chest X-ray. These data suggest
persistent changes in innate immune function following recovery from COVID-19 and
indicate that immune modulating therapies targeting monocytes and leucocyte migration
may be useful in recovering COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms.

Main
The Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was carried out
at four hospitals in Greater Manchester, UK, and was designed to examine immune
responses in COVID-19 patients during primary admission (acute phase) and recovery
(convalescence; Figure 1). We recently demonstrated profound alterations in the monocytes
of COVID-19 patients which correlated with disease severity and could potentially be used to
identify patients destined for a severe disease outcome upon admission1. Immune
dysfunction in monocytes was a defining feature of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.
Whether monocyte abnormalities persist during convalescence following patient discharge is
currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate distinct alterations in monocytes in convalescent
COVID-19 patients during recovery, which correlate with radiographic features of disease
and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).

Between 14th June and 25th August 2020, 44 patients attending outpatient follow up at
median of 87 days (IQR 79.5-99 days) after discharge following inpatient admission for
COVID-19 were included as “convalescent” patients. COVID-19 cases were defined by a
positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 or characteristic symptoms and radiographic changes
of COVID-19 in the absence of a positive test. Additionally, patients were included where full
clinical and monocyte data were available. One patient was excluded due to a confounding
non-COVID acute illness at the time of COVID-19 admission. All of the convalescent
patients had abnormal chest X-rays at the time of primary hospital admission and were
retrospectively scored for disease severity according to the degree of respiratory failure
(Extended data 1). At outpatient follow up, 26% of convalescent patients continued to
display abnormalities on chest imaging attributed to COVID-19. 36% of convalescent
patients with no chest imaging abnormalities remained breathless compared with 64% of
patients who continued to exhibit an abnormal chest X-ray (Figure 2).

Two comparator groups were included in analysis; twenty “acute” patients (in-patients with
COVID-19) were recruited during the same time period as convalescent COVID-19 patients,
and healthy controls (Extended data 2). Three patients were excluded due to concurrent
confounding acute illnesses.

Monocytes can contribute significantly to inflammatory disease directly or via their
differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells in peripheral tissues; recent reports
demonstrate infiltrates of monocytes in the lungs, kidney, heart, spleen, and muscle from
post-mortem tissue of deceased COVID-19 patients2-4. Failure of lung injury resolution often
leads to the development of pulmonary fibrosis, in which monocytes and macrophages play
a key role5, and is a complication of great concern following COVID-19 infection. We, and
others, have previously demonstrated that during acute infection and hospitalisation,
monocytes from COVID-19 patients exhibit a restricted capacity to produce inflammatory
cytokines in response to activation with microbial stimuli1,6. The reasons for this are unclear,
but may signify exhaustion of immune cells in COVID-19 patients, which is supported by the
rapid reduction in systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines following admission to intensive
care1.

The restoration of monocyte responses in recovery from COVID-19 has not been addressed
to date. We now show that following stratification of convalescent patients at follow up,
production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα by monocytes in response to
stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was consistently higher in convalescent patients
with normal chest X-rays and no dyspnoea (Figure 3a). To determine whether enhanced
cytokine production by monocytes was unique to convalescence, we compared
convalescent patients to hospitalised acute COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.
Monocytes from acute patients produced levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFα, IL1β and CCL2 comparable to healthy controls, in contrast to their convalescent counterparts

that demonstrated increased proportions of monocytes producing IL-6 and TNFα (Figure
3b). Production of IL-6 by monocytes was correlated with production of TNFα in
convalescence (Figure 3c).

We next examined whether the ability of monocytes from COVID-19 convalescent patients
to produce inflammatory cytokines was related to their disease severity during acute
admission. Monocytes from those patients who had moderate or severe disease in hospital
during acute disease produced more IL-6 (but not TNFα) during convalescence compared to
previously mild patients (Extended data 3a). Taken with abnormal chest X-ray and
dyspnoea in recovery being predominant in patients with moderate and severe disease
during acute phase (Figure 2), the discordance between IL-6 and dyspnoea/abnormal chest
X-ray at follow up indicate that recovery of monocyte exhaustion and restoration of cytokine
production is important in resolving lung injury following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Although IL-6 is implicated in lung injury pathogenesis7, blockade of IL-6 can worsen lung
injury8. This dual role for IL-6 in lung injury is likely dependent on the local cytokine milieu
and the timing of the disease course.

Linear regression analysis comparing monocyte cytokine production in convalescence with
clinical parameters measured at the time of acute admission including CRP levels, FiO2,
monocyte count, neutrophil count or lymphocyte count showed no significant correlations
(Extended data 3b). Age or BMI during acute COVID-19 did not affect TNFα or IL-6
production by monocytes in convalescence (Extended data 3c). Although monocytes from
male COVID-19 convalescent patients had a propensity to produce more TNFα than their
female counterparts, gender did not impact on IL-6 production (Extended data 3d).
Furthermore, monocytes from male convalescent patients produced heightened levels of
TNFα compared to male acute patients and male controls (Extended data 3e), indicating
the heightened production of TNFα in convalescent patients was not due to differences in

male:female ratios between groups. Overall, these data indicate that enhanced monocyte
responsiveness following SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with resolution of lung injury in
recovery. Interestingly, in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, TNFα accelerates resolution
of fibrosis9 and may perform a similar function in COVID-19 in terms of resolution of lung
injury.

Given that enhanced monocytic infiltrates are found in post-mortem specimens of the lungs
and peripheral tissues of COVID-19 patients2-4, we next examined monocytes in
convalescent COVID-19 patients for altered expression of molecules involved in cell
migration including chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules and integrins. As with the
cytokine data, we examined for correlations between migration markers and current
abnormal chest X-ray. Integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4, adhesion molecule CD31/PECAM and
chemokine receptor CXCR6 on monocytes in convalescence were consistently higher in
patients with fully resolved radiographic features of COVID-19 (normal chest X-rays; Figure
4a). A greater proportion of monocytes in acute admission COVID-19 patients also
expressed CXCR6 compared to controls as well as in convalescence, but although nearly all
monocytes expressed adhesion molecule CD62L in all cases, levels of CD62L expression
on monocytes were heightened in the acute admission group only (Figure 4b). CD62L
levels were normal in the convalescent group (Figure 4b), but several migration molecules
were aberrantly expressed on monocytes from convalescent patients only, rather than
during active disease, including LFA-1, VLA-4, and CD31/PECAM (Figure 4c).

Monocytes utilize CD31/PECAM-1 for migration through the endothelium10, in the process of
crossing the endothelial lining of blood vessels to enter tissues (transendothelial migration).
VLA-4 is used for adhesion of activated endothelium11 and LFA-1 for intralumenal crawling12.
These molecules thereby facilitate monocyte infiltration into peripheral tissues with CXCR6
directing migration towards CXCL16 produced in tissues under inflammatory conditions13.
Our data indicate that even after the acute disease period, monocytes from COVID-19

patients demonstrated increased potential to migrate into peripheral tissues compared to
controls during recovery. CD62L plays a key role in regulating recruitment of monocytes to
lymphoid tissue during inflammation14; thus the enhanced expression of CD62L on
monocytes in acute patients suggests increased migration of monocytes to lymph nodes
during active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but is resolved during convalescence. Enhanced
migration to lymphoid tissue during infection would also at least in part explain why there are
no changes in circulating monocyte numbers in acute patients despite indications of
enhanced egress of monocytes from bone marrow during COVID-19 from our previous
findings1.

Expression of these migration-associated molecules by monocytes in convalescent patients
was not correlated to the level of disease severity from acute admission apart from VLA-4
which was only significantly higher in convalescent patients who had severe or moderate
COVID-19 upon their primary admission to hospital (Extended data 4). Monocyte
expression of migration molecules in convalescent patients was not correlated to clinical
parameters measured during previous hospitalisation including CRP levels, Fi02, monocyte
count, neutrophil count or lymphocyte count (Extended data 5). Migration molecule
expression was not correlated to age, gender or BMI (Extended data 6).

The mechanisms by which monocytes may be involved in resolution of lung injury are
unclear, but there are implications for repopulation of tissue resident macrophage
populations in the lung that contribute directly to tissue repair. Overall, these data indicate
that restored activation of monocytes upon stimulation and alterations in the expression of
molecules associated with migration are associated with lung injury resolution following
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reprogramming of innate immune cells after exposure to pathogens
has been reported previously. This phenomenon has been associated with epigenetic
reprogramming, known as trained immunity, and confers non-specific immunity from
secondary infections including respiratory syncytial virus (major cause of the common cold)

and influenza virus15-17. Monocytes undergo epigenetic reprogramming following exposure to
Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, causing enhanced production of inflammatory
cytokines including TNFα up to 3 months after vaccination, in response to unrelated
stimuli18. Further studies are necessary to determine whether reprogramming of monocytes
following COVID-19 infection may confer protection against subsequent infections (SARSCoV-2 or unrelated).

In summary, we have identified features of circulating monocytes in convalescent COVID-19
patients that correspond to resolution of lung injury including restoration of cytokine
production in response to stimuli, expression of migration-associated molecules and
recovery of monocyte exhaustion. Focusing immune modulation strategies on monocytes
and leucocyte migration following hospital discharge provides the potential for targeted
therapeutic strategies in patients with persistent COVID-19 associated symptoms.

Figure 3. Cytokine production by circulating monocytes in COVID-19 convalescent
patients.
(A) Graphs show proportions of circulating monocytes producing IL-6 and TNF following LPS
stimulation of freshly prepared PBMCs from healthy individuals (IL-6: n=11, TNF : n=21),
convalescent COVID-19 patients with normal chest X-ray (CXR; IL-6: n=25; TNF :n=22),
abnormal CXR (IL-6: n=9; TNF : n=9), dyspnoea (IL-6: n=21; TNF : n=19) or no dyspnoea
(IL-6:n=13; TNF : n=11). (B) Graphs show proportions of circulating monocytes producing IL6, TNf , IL-1 and CCL-2 following LPS stimulation of freshly prepared PBMCs from healthy
individuals (IL-6: n=11, TNF : n=21), acute admission COVID-19 patients (n=18), and
convalescent COVID-19 patients (n=37). (C) Correlations of stimulated monocytes from
convalescent COVID-19 patients producing IL-6 versus those producing TNF (n=35). Within
the acute admission group, open triangles represent “very mild” patients which have
minimal/no substantial changes on CXR related to COVID-19 during acute admission. One
way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc test: 3A, B. Spearman ranked coefficient correlation
test: 3C. (P*<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001).

Figure 4. Migration marker expression by circulating monocytes in COVID-19
convalescent patients.
(A) Graphs show proportions of circulating monocytes expressing LFA-1 and CXCR6 in
healthy individuals (LFA-1: n=23; CXCR6: n=22), convalescent patients with normal CXR
(LFA-1: n=29; CXCR6: n=24) and abnormal CXR (LFA-1: n=10; CXCR6: n=10), and graphs
show levels of expression of VLA-4 and CD31 as assessed by mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) from healthy individuals (VLA-4: n=23; CD31: n=24), convalescent patients with normal

CXR (VLA-4: n=21;CD31: n=29) and abnormal CXR (VLA-4: n=8; CD31: n=10). (B) Graphs
show proportions of circulating monocytes expressing CXCR6 and levels of expression of
CD62L as assessed by MFI from healthy individuals (CXCR6: n=22; CD62L: n=23), acute
admission COVID-19 patients (CXCR6: n=28; CD62L: n=26) and convalescent COVID-19
patients (CXCR6: n=44; CD62L: n=33). (C) Graphs show proportions of circulating monocytes

Extended data 4. Correlations of migration marker expression by monocytes during
convalescence with disease severity during acute admission.

Graphs show proportions of monocytes expressing LFA-1 (controls: n=23; mild: n=6;
moderate: n=13; severe: n=20), VLA-4 (controls: n= 23; mild: n=6; moderate: n=9; severe:
n=14) and CXCR6 (controls: n=22; mild: n=7; moderate: n=11; severe: n=21), and levels of
expression of VLA-4 (controls: n=23; mild: n=6; moderate: n=8; severe: n=14) and CD31
(controls: n=24; mild: n=7; moderate: n=11; severe: n=21) as assessed by MFI from
convalescent COVID-19 patients, based on their disease severity during acute admission
stage of disease. One way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post-hoc test: LFA-1, VLA-4 %, CD31
MFI, CXCR6. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test: VLA-4 MFI. (P*<0.05; **P<0.01;
***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001).
