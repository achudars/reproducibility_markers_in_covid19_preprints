Abstract

48

Background

49

Residents of nursing homes (NH) are at high risk of COVID-19 related morbidity and death and may

50

respond poorly to vaccination because of old age and frequent comorbidities.

51
52

Methods

53

Forty residents and forty staff members either naïve or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were

54

recruited in two NH in Belgium before immunization with two doses of 30µg BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine

55

at day 0 and day 21. Binding antibodies (Ab) to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), spike

56

domains S1 and S2, RBD Ab avidity, and neutralizing Ab against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and B.1.351

57

variant were assessed at days 0, 21, 28, and 49.

58
59

Results

60

SARS-CoV-2 naïve residents had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination than naïve

61

staff. These poor responses involved lower levels of IgG to all domains of the vaccine antigen, lower

62

avidity of RBD IgG, and lower levels of Ab neutralizing the vaccine strain. No naïve resident had

63

detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant. High and comparable Ab responses were observed

64

in residents and staff previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Clustering analysis revealed that poor

65

vaccine responders not only included naïve residents but also naïve staff, emphasizing the

66

heterogeneity of responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population.

67
68

Conclusions

69

The poor Ab responses to mRNA vaccination observed in infection naïve residents and in some naïve

70

staff members of NH suggest suboptimal protection against breakthrough infection, especially with

71

variants of concern. Adapted vaccination regimens may be needed to provide optimal protection

72

against COVID-19 to vulnerable populations.

Introduction

74

Residents of nursing homes (NH) are at a disproportionately high risk of COVID-19 related morbidity

75

and mortality, representing about 5% of all cases while accounting for >30% of all COVID-19 related

76

deaths in the United States [1,2]. Vaccination campaigns around the world have therefore generally

77

prioritized NHs, achieving high coverage rates especially among residents [3,4]. As a result, new

78

cases and deaths have declined steeply in such facilities, outpacing national rates [5–7].

79
80

The success of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in NH is consistent with data from phase 2 studies

81

indicating potent immunogenicity of these vaccines in younger and older adults [8,9]. However, recent

82

observational studies have found lower antibody (Ab) responses to BNT162b2 vaccination in older

83

adults [10–12]. In addition, chronic comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease

84

were associated with lower vaccine responses [11,13]. These data raise the concern that NH

85

residents, who are old, frail, and often have comorbidities, might respond more poorly to COVID-19

86

vaccination. Supporting this concern, a retrospective observational cohort study from Denmark found

87

lower vaccine effectiveness in NH residents (64%) as compared to healthcare workers (90%) one

88

week after the second dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination [14].

89
90

Decreased efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in NH residents may be particularly problematic in the

91

face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that are less susceptible to vaccine-induced neutralizing Ab

92

[15–17]. Breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants following complete mRNA vaccination

93

have been reported in healthy adults and more recently, severe COVID-19 and death have been

94

reported following an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant in a NH in Kentucky [18,19]. The

95

concern of severe breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants may be lower in NH residents

96

who have survived natural infection. Indeed, COVID-19 mRNA vaccination induces higher Ab

97

responses in previously infected adults as compared to infection naïve adults and boosts neutralizing

98

Ab cross-reacting with variants of concern [20–25]. The level of cross-reactive immunity induced by

99

mRNA vaccination in naïve and previously infected NH residents is currently unclear.

100
101

Taken together, available data raise concern regarding immunity induced by current COVID-19 mRNA

102

vaccine regimens in infection naïve and frail NH residents, especially in the current context of

103

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We therefore established a longitudinal cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naïve

Study design and approvals

110

This study is nested in a prospective cohort study named PICOV (Prior Infection with SARS-CoV-2)

111

[26]. The objective of this nested study was to measure the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA

112

vaccination in naïve and previously infected residents and members of staff. The study was approved

113

by the Ethics Committee of the Hôpital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium (reference B4062020000134), the

114

Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (2021-000401-24), and is registered on

115

ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04527614).

116
117

Recruitment and clinical sample collection

118

SARS-CoV-2 infection-naïve and previously infected residents and staff from two Belgian NHs were

119

recruited. Those with a documented positive RT-qPCR or serological test result at baseline were

120

considered to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Main exclusion criteria for NH residents

121

included a previous diagnosis of dementia, a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score ≤18/30,

122

and life expectancy <6 months. As described previously, scores from the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)

123

and Quality of Life (QoL) were determined for residents at baseline [26].

124
125

All subjects were immunized with two doses of 30μg BNT162b2 mRNA from BioNTech/Pfizer

126

(Comirnaty®), 21 days apart. Blood samples were collected on the day of the primary dose (baseline

127

or day 0), the day of the boost (day 21) as well as one and four weeks after the boost (respectively

128

day 28 and day 49). Serum was separated by blood centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes and stored

129

at -20°C for downstream Ab analyses.

130
131

SARS-CoV-2-Specific Binding Antibodies

132

Levels of serum Ab were assessed using a multiplexed immunoassay (Multi-SARS-CoV-2

133

Immunoassay), developed in collaboration with InfYnity Biomarkers (Lyon, France). In this microarray,

134

SARS-CoV-2 antigens, selected for their individual performance, were printed in 96-well polystyrene

135

microplates using a sciFLEXARRAYER printing system (Scienion, Germany). Individual SARS-CoV-2

136

antigens, including Spike 1 domain (S1, encompassing AA16-685 of S), Spike 2 domain (S2,

137

encompassing AA686-1213 of S), and Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), were printed in duplicate

138

(GenBank YP009724390.1). Serial dilutions of test samples as well as positive and negative control

139

sera were incubated in microarray plates for 1h at room temperature (RT) and washed with

140

phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Next, plates were incubated (1h, RT) with

141

horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG and washed with PBST before adding a

142

precipitating TMB solution for 20min (RT, dark). Then, TMB was removed and plates were dried at

143

37°C for 10min. Microplates were imaged and analyzed using a microplate reader (SciReader CL,

144

Scienion, Germany). The average pixel intensity for each spot was calculated for each antigen/dilution

145

and reported as net intensity. The dynamic range of each antigen measurement was defined using

146

serial dilutions of positive sera. Only antigen measurements within the dynamic range were

147

considered and were multiplied by the dilution factor. For each serum, quantitative results were eligible

148

if at least 2 dilutions report comparable results (%CV<28%). Results are reported as arbitrary pixel

149

units per milliliter (AU/ml). ROC-analyses using an independent population for validation generated

150

cutoff concentrations of 21.0 AU/ml, 19.5 AU/ml and 19.5 AU/ml for RBD, S1 and S2, respectively

151

(Supplementary methods).

SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibodies

154

Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum (1/50-1/25600 in EMEM supplemented with 2mM L-

155

glutamine, 100U/ml - 100μg/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin and 2% fetal bovine serum) were incubated

156

during 1h (37°C, 7% CO2) with 3xTCID100 of (i) a wild type (WT) Wuhan strain (2019-nCoV-Italy-

157

INMI1, reference 008V-03893) and (ii) the B.1.351 variant of SARS-CoV-2, in parallel. Sample-virus

158

mixtures and virus/cell controls were added to Vero cells (18.000 cells/well) in a 96-well plate and

159

incubated for five days (37°C, 7% CO2). The cytopathic effect caused by viral growth was scored

160

microscopically. The Reed-Muench method was used to calculate the neutralizing Ab titer that

161

reduced the number of infected wells by 50% (NT50), which was used as a proxy for the neutralizing

162

Ab concentration in the sample [27].

165

Bio-layer interferometry measurements were performed with an Octet HTX instrument (Fortébio) using

166

AR2G biosensors. Data analyses were performed using FortéBio Data Analysis 9.0 software. Kinetic

167

assays were performed at 25-30˚C at a sample plate agitation speed of 1000rpm. Sensors were first

168

activated by immersion in a solution containing 20mM EDC and 10mM s-NHS. Then, 0.05mg/ml of

169

RBD antigen in 10mM sodium acetate pH 6 was loaded for 600sec. After antigen loading, the

170

biosensors were immersed in a solution of 1M ethanolamine pH8.5 to prevent non-specific

171

interactions. Antigen loaded AR2G sensors were first dipped in PBS to establish a baseline time

172

curve, and then immersed for 10min in wells containing purified serum IgG at three different dilutions

173

(3-5-8x). Following IgG association, dissociation was monitored for 600sec in PBS. Negative controls

174

included ligand without IgG and IgG without ligand. Kinetic parameters were determined by global

175

fitting of the association and dissociation phases of the binding curves according to a 1:1 binding

176

model.

177
178

Statistical analyses

179

Analyses were performed in R (version 4.0.3). Categorical data were presented as frequencies and

180

percentages, continuous data as means (SD). The Kruskall-Wallis test and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U

181

test alongside multiple testing correction with the false discovery rate were used for all time wise group

182

comparisons. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare WT and B.1.351 variant neutralizing Ab at

183

day 49. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (rho, ρ) were determined for associations between

184

WT and B.1.351 variant neutralizing Ab, SARS-CoV-2 binding Ab, and Ab avidity.

185
186

A Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis was performed using the R

187

package “umap” for dimensionality reduction of the following outcomes at day 49: anti-RBD/S1/S2

188

IgG, anti-RBD IgG avidity, and WT NT50. To achieve normality, avidity was log10 and neutralization

189

log2 transformed. The optimal number of clusters was tested via the k-means (range 1:10) and visually

190

identified with an “elbow” in a plot of variance versus number of clusters. DBSCAN (“dbscan” package)

191

identified clusters within the UMAP reduced dimensions.

192

Results

194

The study included 40 residents and 40 members of staff who were either naïve or previously infected

195

with SARS-CoV-2 before they received 2 x 30µg BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine at their respective NH. In

196

previously infected subjects, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred between 269 and 315 days before

197

vaccination. Complete cohort and demographic information is provided in Table 1. Although residents

198

with the poorest health status were excluded, most enrolled residents were frail and many suffered

199

multiple co-morbidities requiring medication.

200
201

Levels of binding Ab to SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike subunit domains

202

one (S1) and two (S2) were measured in longitudinal serum samples using a multiplex immunoassay.

203

Detailed numerical data are presented in Tab.S1. At baseline, naïve staff and residents had

204

undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG whereas high levels of Ab were detected in

205

previously infected subjects (Fig.1a, Fig.S1). Primary vaccination induced a significant increase in

206

SARS-CoV-2 Ab in naïve as well as previously infected staff and residents, and Ab levels were further

207

boosted following secondary vaccination at day 21 (Fig.1a). Vaccine-induced Ab levels to RBD and

208

S1 were about six-fold lower in naïve residents as compared to naïve staff following primary

209

vaccination and two-fold lower after booster vaccination (Fig.1b). In comparison to naïve subjects, Ab

210

levels were strongly increased in both residents and staff previously infected with SARS-CoV-2

211

(Fig.1b and Fig.S1). Among previously infected subjects, residents had higher Ab responses to RBD

212

and S1 as compared to staff. Ab responses to S2 were lower than responses to RBD and S1,

213

especially in naïve subjects.

214
215

The avidity of RBD-specific Ab was measured using bio-layer interferometry. Rapid avidity maturation

216

was observed after primary vaccination in naïve and previously infected staff (Fig.2a). High RBD IgG

217

avidity was also observed in previously infected residents at day 21, whereas avidity could only be

218

assessed in few naïve residents who had sufficiently high levels of RBD Ab to be characterized

219

(Fig.2a). Following booster vaccination, RBD IgG avidity further increased in naïve staff and residents,

220

but remained stable in previously infected subjects (Fig.2a). Four weeks after booster vaccination (day

221

49), Ab avidity was significantly higher in naïve staff as compared to naïve residents, and was higher

222

in previously infected subjects as compared to naïve subjects (Fig.2b).

223
224

The lower levels and avidity of vaccine-induced Ab observed in naïve residents as compared to naïve

225

staff suggested lower neutralizing Ab capacity. To explore this possibility, titers of neutralizing Ab

226

against WT Wuhan strain and B.1.351 variant were measured. Previously infected staff and residents

227

had detectable neutralizing Ab to the Wuhan strain at baseline and these titers further increased by

228

primary and booster vaccinations (Fig.2c). Potent neutralizing Ab responses were also induced by

229

vaccination of naïve staff, although the proportion of subjects with detectable responses decreased

230

between day 28 (18/19) and day 49 (14/19). In contrast, only 6/20 naïve residents had detectable

231

neutralizing Ab at day 28 and this proportion increased to 9/20 at day 49 (Fig.2c). At day 49, naïve

232

residents had significantly lower neutralizing Ab responses as compared to naïve staff, whereas

233

higher responses were detected in previously infected subjects as compared to naïve subjects

234

(Fig.2d). Compared to the wild type strain, neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant were reduced

235

five to ten-fold across study groups (Fig.2e). In naïve subjects, only 2/19 staff and none of the naïve

236

residents had detectable neutralizing Ab against the B.1.351 variant at day 49, whereas neutralizing

237

Ab were detected in 19/21 previously infected staff and 18/20 previously infected residents.

238
239

The consistent differences in Ab responses observed between the four study groups suggested a

240

coordinated response to mRNA vaccination across the measured immunological parameters. Indeed,

241

titers of neutralizing Ab against the wild type strain strongly correlated with RBD, S1 and S2 binding

242

Ab, RBD IgG avidity, and neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant (Fig.2f).

243
244

To further explore inter-individual variability of this coordinated response, a clustering analysis was

245

performed to reduce the complete dataset to two dimensions and identify groups of subjects who have

246

similar profiles of Ab responses. Five clusters of study participants with distinct Ab levels, avidity, and

247

neutralizing activity at day 49 were identified (Fig.3a-d). These clusters were not correlated with age

248

of the study participants (Fig.3e). Clusters 4 and 5 exclusively contained previously infected subjects

249

with high Ab responses. Interestingly, cluster 5, including the highest Ab responses, was mostly

250

composed of previously infected residents. In contrast, cluster 1, including the lowest Ab responses,

251

was composed of a mix of naïve residents and naïve staff, indicating that both populations contain low

252

responders to mRNA vaccination. Clusters 2 and 3 included intermediate Ab responses and were

253

composed of a mix of naïve residents, naïve staff and some previously infected staff and residents.

254

The clustering analysis therefore revealed a group of poor Ab responders that not only included naïve

255

residents but also naïve staff.

258

Reports on lower Ab responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in older people and in people with

259

chronic comorbidities raise concern about the susceptibility of NH residents to severe breakthrough

260

infections, especially with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [10–13]. In this study, NH residents

261

without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower Ab responses to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination as

262

compared to naïve staff. These defective responses included lower levels of IgG to all domains of the

263

vaccine antigen, lower avidity of RBD IgG and lower levels of neutralizing Ab. Worryingly, none of the

264

naïve residents had detectable neutralizing Ab to the B.1.351 variant.

265
266

Although an immune correlate of protection against COVID-19 has not been established yet, levels of

267

virus-specific binding and neutralizing Ab have been shown to correlate with vaccine efficacy in phase

268

3 studies across different vaccination platforms [28]. In addition, data from pre-clinical studies on non-

269

human primates indicate that mRNA vaccine-induced neutralizing Ab can mediate protection against

270

disease [29–31]. The poor Ab responses observed in our study are therefore likely associated with

271

lower vaccine-induced protection. Providing optimal protection to the vulnerable population of NH

272

residents may require adapted vaccination regimens, such as additional doses of homologous or

273

heterologous vaccines.

274
275

Both age and health status differentiate NH residents and staff. In this cohort, Ab responses were not

276

strongly correlated with age, suggesting a more important role of health status, including frailty and

277

comorbidities. This observation is consistent with the robust Ab responses to mRNA vaccination

278

observed in older people with preserved health status and living outside NH [32]. In both residents and

279

staff, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was a major determinant of Ab responses, with markedly higher

280

Ab levels and quality in previously infected as compared to naïve subjects. NH residents previously

281

infected with SARS-CoV-2 had remarkably high Ab responses to mRNA vaccination and included the

282

highest responders of the cohort. These high vaccine responses likely reflect potent immunological

283

memory potentially induced by more severe infections and selected by survival after COVID-19 [33]. In

284

marked contrast with naïve residents, NH residents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be at

285

particularly low risk of breakthrough infection following mRNA vaccination.

286
287

Another important finding of this study is that poor vaccine responders were not limited to naïve

responses to mRNA vaccination in the general population [34–36]. As mRNA vaccination has only

290

recently been implemented in large populations, the immunological basis of this heterogeneity is

291

currently unknown. Systems immunology, involving high dimensional analyses of the immune system,

292

is emerging as a promising approach to identify determinants of vaccine responsiveness and has the

293

potential to guide the development of next-generation mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 and other

294

target pathogens [37,38].

295
296

Identifying vulnerable populations who may benefit less from current mRNA vaccination regimens is

297

essential for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted mRNA vaccination regimens may be

298

required to protect SARS-CoV-2 naïve residents of NH and younger poor vaccine responders against

299

breakthrough infections, especially with variants of concern.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 Specific Binding Antibody Responses to BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination

434

in Residents and Staff of Nursing Homes.

435

SARS-CoV-2 naïve and previously infected NH residents and staff received two doses of 30µg

436

BNT162b2 vaccine on day 0 and day 21 (arrows). The concentration of spike-specific binding Ab was

437

measured using a multiplex assay before vaccination and at days 21, 28 and 49 after the first dose

438

and is shown as arbitrary pixel units per ml (AU/ml; limit of quantification, 21.0 for RBD, 19.5 for S1

439

and S2). Each data point represents a serum sample. Statistical significance of differences between

440

time points (panel A) and study groups (panel B) were determined by the Kruskall-Wallis test by

441

ranks, using the Mann-Whitney U post-hoc test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing

442

(*: p<0.05; **: p<0.01; ***: p<0.001).

indicates the number of participants with detectable neutralizing Ab (panel C). Black bars indicate

452

median values. Statistical significance of differences between time points and study groups were

453

determined by the Kruskall-Wallis test by ranks, using the Mann-Whitney U post-hoc test and

454

Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing (*: p<0.05; **: p<0.01; ***: p<0.001). For differences

455

between wild type and the B.1.351 variant the Mann-Whitney test was used. Panel F. Spearman’s

456

rank correlation coefficients (rho, ρ) between titers of neutralizing Ab to WT strain and the other Ab

457

response parameters. Data below or above limits of quantification were excluded (gray dots).

Panel A. Clustering (UMAP) analysis of all study participants with available RBD/S1/S2 binding IgG

462

Ab concentrations, RBD-IgG avidity and SARS-CoV-2 wild type neutralization at day 49. The position

463

of individual participants in variable space 1 and 2 indicates similarities or differences in Ab responses.

464

DBSCAN was used to identify clusters. Panels B/C/D. Clusters 1 to 5 are plotted against the RBD

465

binding IgG, RBD IgG avidity and WT neutralizing titers, respectively. Panel E. Age of participants

466

included in clusters of antibody responses. Black bars indicate median values.
