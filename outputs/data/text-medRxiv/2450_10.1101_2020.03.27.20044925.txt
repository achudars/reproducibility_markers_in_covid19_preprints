The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread
globally, resulting in >300,000 reported cases worldwide as of March 21st, 2020. Here we
investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern
California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of
community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29
patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic
analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent
introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive
excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic
in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the
United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple
transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate
travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage. Rapid
testing and contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions are measures that will help
to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread in California and other regions of the USA.

Introduction
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a pandemic that has infected more than
531,000 people around the world and caused more than 24,000 deaths as of March 26th, 2020
(1), including 85,500 cases in the United States and >3,500 in California. The exponential
growth in the number of cases has overburdened clinical care facilities and threatens to
overwhelm the medical workforce. These numbers underestimate the true number of infections
due to the relative paucity of diagnostic testing to date (2) and the presence of asymptomatic or
mild cases (3, 4). As a result, California, along with many other states and countries, has issued
a “shelter-in-place” policy for all residents, effective March 20, 2020. These unprecedented
measures have disrupted daily life significantly for ~40 million inhabitants for an indefinite
period, with the potential for profound economic losses (5).
Until late Feb 2020, the majority of infections identified in the United States were related
to travelers returning from high-risk countries, repatriated citizens under quarantine, or close
contacts of infected patients. Community spread, in which the source of the infection is
unknown, has since been documented in multiple states. Furthermore, Washington State has
reported a series of COVID-19 cases from Jan 21 to Mar 18, following the identification of an
early case, WA1, on Jan 19, suggesting the presence of a persistent transmission chain in the
community [Bedford, et al. 2020].
Genomic epidemiology of emerging viruses has proven to be a useful tool for outbreak
investigation and for tracking virus evolution and spread (6, 7). During the Ebola virus disease
epidemic of 2013-2016 in West Africa, genomic analyses established that the outbreak had a
single zoonotic origin (8), that two major viral lineages were circulating (9), and that sexual

transmission played a role in maintaining some transmission chains (10). Viral genome
sequencing also uncovered the route that Zika virus traveled from northern Brazil (11) to other
regions, including Central America and Mexico (12) and the Caribbean and United States (13).
However, real-time genomic epidemiology data of COVID-19 to inform public health
interventions in California have been lacking.
We recently developed a method called metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer
enrichment (MSSPE) to rapidly enrich and assemble viral genomes directly from clinical
samples (14). Here we used this method to recover viral genomes from COVID-19 patients in
Northern California and perform phylogenetic analysis to better understand the genetic diversity
of SARS-CoV-2 in the US and the nature of transmission of virus lineages in the community.

Results
We generated virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in California from nasal swab
samples from 29 patients, available through the University of California San Francisco (UCSF)
hospital, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, and the California Department of
Public Health (Figure 1A and Table S2). Presumptive positive cases were confirmed to be
SARS-CoV-2 positive by testing using a CDC assay approved by the FDA EUA (Emergency
Use Authorization) on February 4th, 2020 (14). Samples to be sequenced were selected for
broad representation across different counties and association with known outbreaks. The 29
infected patients spanned 9 counties in Northern California (Figure 1B) and included (i) 9
samples airlifted from the Grand Princess cruise ship, during its excursions from San Francisco
to Mexico and Hawaii in February and March 2020, (ii) 3 samples from a Solano County cluster,
including the first reported case of community transmission in the United States, and (iii) 5
patients from a Santa Clara County cluster associated with workspace transmission. Fourteen
of the 29 patients did not have a source of transmission that could be readily identified by travel
history or epidemiological investigation.
We performed MSSPE on each sample to enrich for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome
(15), followed by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of pooled and indexed
samples on Illumina NextSeq or MiSeq instruments (16, 17) (Figure 1A). Virus loads for the 29
patients ranged from 1.3x104 - 2.5x108 copies/mL. An average of 31 million reads (interquartile
ratio, IQR, 23-57 million) were generated per sample, and virus genomes were assembled by
mapping to reference genome NC_045512 (Wuhan-Hu-1). The assembly yielded 28 SARSCoV-2 genomes with genome coverage >60%, and were thus included in this study. We also
retained one partial genome (UC29) with 16.2% coverage, as a full genome from this individual
had been already sequenced from a high-titer earlier sample by the US CDC (MT027062). The
median coverage achieved across all samples was 96.5% (IQR 84.0%-99.7%).
Phylogenetic analysis shows that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated in this study are
dispersed across the evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, estimated from 342 genomes
available on GISAID as of March 17th, 2020 (Figure 2A). These viruses included 2 viruses
likely related to lineages from Wuhan or other regions of China, 4 viruses related to those
circulating in Europe, 11 viruses positioned in small independent clusters and not part of a
larger clade, and 13 viruses associated with the Washington State (WA1) clade (Figure 2B).

A large outbreak was associated with travel on the US cruise ship Grand Princess,
which undertook two consecutive voyages from San Francisco (to Mexico on February 11 - 22,
and to Hawaii on February 22-March 4) with much of the same crew and a shared subset of
passengers. Notably, the 9 available sequenced genomes from crew members and passengers
aboard the cruise ship (UC1, UC5 to UC11, and UC19) all clustered within the WA1 lineage.
The first reported case from the United States within this lineage (WA1) was reported January
19th (18) [Bedford, et al. 2020] and therefore substantially predates the excursions of the Grand
Princess cruise ship . The SARS-CoV-2 sequences from cruise ship passengers and crew all
shared two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNVs), C17747T and A17858G, as well as the
triad of SNVs common to all WA1 lineages (C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C) (Figures 2 and
3). In addition, all of the passengers on the second cruise to Hawaii (UC 5-11) and UC1, who
was on the first cruise to Mexico, carried at least 2 additional mutations not observed in UC19,
who also was on the first cruise. This indicates that the virus from UC19 is most likely basal to
the clade containing the cruise ship strains, and that COVID-19 infections associated with the
first cruise were passed onto passengers and crew on the second cruise. The chronology and
phylogeny of the cruise ship outbreak, along with the predominance of the WA1 lineage in
Washington State but not outside of the US, also suggest that the virus on the Grand Princess
likely came from Washington State, although it is still possible that the cases originated from a
different region in which the WA1 strain is circulating. In addition to the passengers and crew
members on the Grand Princess, virus genomes sampled from five cases of community
transmission in different counties of the Bay area (UC19, UC20, UC22, UC23 and UC28) were
also phylogenetically placed in the WA1 lineage, suggesting possible community circulation of
that lineage in California as well as on the Grand Princess ship.
Two out of the 29 individuals examined in this study (UC12 and UC29) had COVID-19
infections associated with international travel or exposure to travelers. UC12 was a resident of
San Mateo County with a travel history to Switzerland. The genome from UC12 fell within a
large lineage containing many sequences from European residents or travelers from Europe
and therefore it is likely the infection was acquired there. The sequence from individual UC29
(MT027062 is from the same patient) was a returning traveler from China and has an identical
COVID-19 sequence to a household contact (MT027063). Their viral genomes were more
closely related to ancestral lineages from China. Interestingly, three further genomes (UC24,
UC26 and UC27) also grouped within a viral lineage with widespread circulation in Europe.
Individual UC27 was diagnosed after returning from a New York trip, raising the possibility of
interstate transmission. Individual UC26 also reported domestic travel, while local resident
UC24 had no known travel history, illustrating the existence of undetected virus transmission in
the community.
A small cluster of 3 cases in Solano County includes the first reported instance of
community transmission in the US on February 26 (UC4) (Figures 2B and 3). The two other
cases (UC2 and UC3) were healthcare workers who were taking care of patient UC4 and likely
contracted the disease in the hospital, consistent with transmission of the disease from patient
to health care providers (19). Two patients from San Mateo County (UC18 and UC25) were
close household contacts (a husband and wife), and their viruses comprised a separate cluster
with a virus from an infected person from China.

In Santa Clara County, cases with onset dates within two weeks of each other were
associated with a large facility with multiple employers, large areas of shared space, and heavy
pedestrian traffic. Out of five sequenced cases from this outbreak cluster (UC13 to UC17), three
formed a distinct cluster by phylogenetic analysis (UC14 was an employee at the facility, while
UC16 and UC17 were family members living in the same residence), indicating likely household
transmission (Figures 2B and 3). Notably, the genome from a Solano county resident (UC21)
was also grouped into this cluster, suggesting possible circulation of a virus lineage between
different counties. An active investigation regarding a putative epidemiologic link involving UC21
and individuals in the Santa Clara County cluster had been initiated prior to the genomic
analyses and is ongoing at the time of publication. Two other workers (UC13 and UC15) also
operated at the same building and had no direct contact with UC14; all three had different
employers and no known social contact with each other. Consistent with this epidemiological
data, the genomes (UC13-15) from the three workers in the large facility are distinct from each
other (i.e. no identifiable shared SNV). Several possible scenarios could give rise to this
observation, including the prospect that more than one virus lineage was introduced into the
building via different events or the workers were infected as a result of community transmission.
Discussion
The genomic epidemiology of the COVID-19 cases associated with community spread
studied here do not show a predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage circulating in Northern California.
This epidemiological profile is distinct to that in Washington State, in which the vast majority of
virus genomes sequenced to date belong to a single phylogenetic lineage, WA1 [Bedford, et al.
2020]. The WA1 lineage strains share common ancestry with an early imported lineage that
seem to have established transmission in Washington State from January 2020. By contrast, in
California, we conclude that multiple recent and unrelated introductions of COVID-19 into the
state via different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus lineages reported in
this study, rather than cryptic transmission of a single pre-existing lineage among counties in
California. We note that this does not exclude the possibility of cryptic transmission of multiple
lineages in California, as the current level of sampling is not dense enough to estimate
confidently the dates of the seeding events, nor the subsequent periods of cryptic transmission
before a lineage was identified.
The co-clustering of the lineages from the Grand Princess cruise ship and those from
several Northern California counties with community-transmitted cases in Washington State
suggests an established lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA. Notably, the WA1 lineage has
been recently identified in COVID-19 cases in Illinois, Minnesota, Connecticut, and Utah. The
early date and basal phylogenetic position of the WA1 lineage makes it likely that the direction
of dissemination was from Washington State to other states; however that conclusion could
change if further genomic sampling in the US revealed substantial levels of virus genetic
diversity. SARS-CoV-2 mutates more slowly than many other human RNA viruses, on the order
of 1 to 2 SNV mutations a month across its ~29 kB genome (20), as it contains a nonstructural
gene with proofreading activity (21). Despite this, the WA1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 is readily
identifiable with 3 key SNVs, C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C (Figure 3) which, at this stage in
the epidemic, are distinct from other SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Our epidemiological and genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2 has several limitations. First,
this initial analysis represents relatively sparse sampling of cases. Undersampling of virus
genomes is due in part to the high proportion of cases (80%) with asymptomatic or mild disease
(3, 4, 20) and limited diagnostic testing for COVID-19 infection to date in California and
throughout the United States. Second, the majority of samples analyzed were obtained from
public health laboratories and thus may not be representative of the general population. Finally,
phylogenetic clustering of viruses from different locations, such as Washington State and
California in the same clade, does not prove directionality of spread. Despite this, our study
shows that more robust insights into COVID-19 transmission are achievable if virus genomic
diversity is combined and jointly interpreted with detailed epidemiological case data.
Public health containment measures such as prompt isolation and contact tracing, as
performed in the Solano County and Santa Clara County clusters, become more difficult to
maintain once a lineage becomes established in the community. Our data suggest concerning
trends in this direction, such as the association between the WA1 lineage and communityacquired COVID-19 cases in several counties of Northern California, travel-associated
introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the San Francisco Bay Area from New York state, and a virus
from the lineage associated with a Santa Clara County cluster detected in a resident of Solano
County. Social distancing interventions, such as the “shelter-in-place” directive that was issued
by the governor of California on March 20, 2020, may assist in stemming community spread of
imported cases. If interstate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 lineages within the US is common,
then the suspension of non-essential domestic and international long-range travel may be
necessary to prevent further importation of new cases in California and other states.
Methods
Ethics Statement
Clinical specimens were processed at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF)
under protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (protocol no. 10-01116, 1105519). Specimens collected by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) were deidentified and deemed not research or exempt by the Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects (Project number 2020-30) issued under the California Health and Human Services
Agency's Federal Wide Assurance #00000681 with the Office of Human Research Protections.
A non-research determination for this project was also granted by Sonoma County as it was
designated epidemic disease control activity, with collected data directly related to disease
control.

Sample Collection
Samples obtained from the UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were nasopharyngeal
and oropharyngeal swabs and placed in universal transport media (UTM, 350C, Copan
Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA). Samples obtained from the California Department of Public
Health (CDPH) and SCDPH were nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.

Quantitative PCR testing for SARS-CoV2 was performed by the CDC, California
Department of Public Health, or the UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. At UCSF, samples
were extracted on a Magna Pure 24 Viral Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, USA) or a EZ1
Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hillden, Germany). At the California Department of Public Health,
samples were extracted using Qiagen DSP Viral RNA mini kit with carrier RNA added (Qiagen).
The one-step RT-PCR used the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay targets N1 and N2, and
the 2019-nCoV N Positive Control plasmid (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. IDT, Coralville,
USA) as a positive control. The RNA extracts were added to an amplification reaction mix (4X
TaqPath 1-step RT-PCR master mix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), 1.5 ul primer (N1, N2,
or RNase P), 12.5ul nuclease-free water, and 1ul RNA) and one-step RT-PCR was performed
(25ºC for 2 mins, reverse transcription at 50ºC for 15 mins, 95ºC for 2 mins, followed by 45
cycles PCR with denaturing at 95ºC for 3s and extension at 55ºC for 30s). The cut-off for a
confirmed positive sample was determined to be at a Ct value of 40 cycles, with both targets of
N1 and N2 necessarily being classified as positive by quantitative RT-PCR, except for a positive
RNase P as an internal quality control.
Whole Genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV2
The extracted RNA described above was converted to cDNA using MSSPE method
(Metagenomic Sequencing with Spiked Primer Enrichment) as previously described (15). The
custom designed SARS-CoV-2 primers (13-nucleotide in length, IDT Technologies) were
constructed using 30 early SARS-CoV-2 genome references in the National Instiutes of Health
(NIH) GenBank database, and were subsequently added to the reverse transcription process
(Table S1). The cDNA eluate was made into sequencing libraries through tagmentation
(Nextera XT, Illumina), and were individually barcoded in preparation for Illumina sequencing.
The samples were then bead-washed with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA) at
0.92X (23uL). The barcoded library then directly proceeds into a library recovery step. 5uL of
the library is added to an amplification reaction mix (10uL Phusion 5X Buffer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, USA), 2.5uL of 10uM forward and reverse general primers, 1uL of 12.5mM
dNTPs, 0.5uL Phusion enzyme (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 31uL nuclease-free
water) for 14 cycles, with cycling parameters as previously described (22). The amplicons were
again purified using 0.9X volume of AMPure XP beads. At this point, the purified PCR product
can be analyzed by gel electrophoresis to check library size.The eluted library was quantified
using a Qubit fluorometer. Sequencing libraries were then sequenced on MiSeq, Nextseq, or
HiSeq 1500 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA) as 1x150 single-end or 2x150 paired-end reads.
Genome assembly and consensus generation
Raw reads were first screened via BLASTn (BLAST+ package 2.9.0) (23) for alignment
to reference strain NC_045512. They were then aligned to the reference with LASTZ version
1.04.03. SARS-CoV-2 reads were trimmed using Geneious version 11.1.3 by removal of 13
nucleotides (nt) (the length of the MSSPE primer) and low-quality reads from the ends, followed
by removal of duplicate reads. Trimmed reads were mapped to reference genome NC_045512
in Geneious with no gaps allowed and a maximum of 5% mismatches per read. The assembled
contig was then manually annotated, and a consensus genome was generated using a majority
threshold criterion.

Phylogenetic analysis and genomic comparison
Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.427 (24) under default settings and multiple
sequence alignments were manually corrected. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in PhyML
v3.3 (25) under an HKY+Γ4 substitution model (26, 27). The location of SNPs and gaps were
extracted from alignments using a custom Python script and visualized using a custom R-script.
Data Sharing
The assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes in this study were uploaded to GISAID (28–29)
as FASTA files, and can be visualized on a continually updated phylogenetic tree on NextStrain
(30). Submission of the genomes and raw sequence data to NIH GenBank and Sequence Read
Archive (SRA) is pending.

Figure 2. Phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in California. (A) Phylogenetic tree of 342
SARS-CoV2 genomes along with the 29 genomes in this survey. Multiple sequence alignment
of all available SARS-CoV-2 genomes in GISAID as of March 22nd, 2020, was performed using
MAFFT (24), followed by tree constructions using PhyML (25). Viral lineages from California or
Washington State are colored, while those outside of California and Washington are shown in
gray. (B) A zoomed view of individual phylogenetic clusters corresponding to the WA1 lineage
(1), Santa Clara County cluster (2), and Solano County cluster (3).

Figure 3: Multiple sequence alignment of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported across 9
counties and 1 cruise ship. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with respect to the reference
strain (NC_045512) are shown in vertical red lines. Cases that are grouped into the WA1 cluster
er
(defined as containing the C8782T, C18060T, T28144C SNVs) include the first identified case
of COVID-19 infection (WA1) in the United States on January 15th, 2020, 9 passengers and
crew members aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship, and 4 Northern California counties. Two
th
additional SNVs, C17747T and A17858G, are common to SARS-CoV-2 viruses associated with
the Grand Princess cruise ship. Single SNV variants C9924T and G29711T define groups of
infected individuals in the Solano County (UC2, UC3, and UC4) and Santa Clara County (UC14,
4,
UC16, and UC17) clusters, respectively.
