Disclaimer: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing situation worldwide, and this
is a preprint paper not yet peer-reviewed. Therefore, the results of this research may
change, according to recommendations of other experts. Despite this, the authors in
this research present this analysis to aid decision-making worldwide, confident in
the interpretation of the main aim, showing that social non-pharmacological
interventions can reduce COVID-19 burden in upper-middle income countries with
younger and overall healthier populations.

Summary paragraph
A novel pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in late 2019 in Wuhan
(China)1,2. COVID-19 has caused 77 national governments worldwide to impose a lockdown in
part or all their countries, as of April 4, 20203. The United States and the United Kingdom
estimated the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID-19 deaths, but
there is less evidence to support choice of control measures in middle-income countries4. We
used Colombia, an upper-middle income country, as a case-study to assess the effect of social
interventions to suppress or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that a combination
of social distancing interventions, triggered by critical care admissions, can suppress and
mitigate the peak of COVID-19, resulting in less critical care use, hospitalizations, and deaths.
We found, through a mathematical simulation model, that a one-time social intervention may
delay the number of critical care admissions and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, a series of social interventions (social and work distance and school closures) over a
period of a year can reduce the expected burden of COVID-19, however, these interventions
imply long periods of lockdown. Colombia would prevent up to 97% of COVID-19 deaths using
these triggered series of interventions during the first year. Our analyses could be used by
decision-makers from other middle-income countries with similar demographics and contact
patterns to Colombia to reduce COVID-19 critical care admissions and deaths in their
jurisdictions.

The novel pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in
Wuhan, China, in late 20191,2. As of April 4, 2020, this pandemic has resulted in 1,192,028
confirmed cases and 64,316 deaths worldwide5. COVID-19 has caused 77 national governments
around the world to impose a lockdown in part or all their countries, as of April 4, 20203.
However, most world jurisdictions have not achieved the containment of COVID-19. Only China
Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea had appeared to be successful so far in the suppression
of transmission of COVID-19. China contained the virus after social isolation measures. Despite
this, a report6 suggested that if these social interventions (non-pharmacological interventions)
had been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in mainland China, cases in this
region could had been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively. However, if these social
interventions were instead conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of
cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase, respectively. South Korea,
instead, began systematically testing for the virus and isolating individuals reported to have
COVID-19. Despite the success of South Korea in containing the virus, this approach may be
difficult to implement in countries who lack comparable human, technological, and economical
resources to support widespread case detection, contact tracing and testing.
Several social interventions have been proposed for those countries who fail to act early in the
pandemic. These interventions may suppress (lower the effective reproductive value to less than
one) or mitigate (reduce the epidemic peak) the number of cases, deaths, and other adverse
outcomes of COVID-19. Some of these social non-pharmacological interventions include social
distance, work distance, or closure of schools and universities. Imperial College London
suggested the United Kingdom could expect 510 thousand deaths without suppression or
mitigation, and a reduction between 92-98% of deaths with several social interventions4. The
report by Ferguson et al. (2020)4 simulated an intermittent intervention that would be triggered in
the United Kingdom by reaching between 60 and 400 critical care admissions in a day, under
several transmission scenarios.
The Ferguson et al.4 report and derivate analysis in Europe7 represent a roadmap of potential
interventions worldwide. These analyses were only applied to high-income countries and did not
consider other potential interventions that could be implemented to suppress or mitigate the
pandemic for the next two years. Such modelling approaches may be suitable for application to
middle- and low-income countries, however the demographic distribution of younger, and
therefore healthier overall population, may influence their results and interpretation.
Here we attempt to inform decision-making in developing jurisdictions, by showing some
interventions are not predicted to reduce the attack rate or adverse outcomes and only delay the
epidemic peak, while a more comprehensive set of interventions triggered throughout a year may
reduce resource use and deaths in a middle-income country. We took Colombia, a South
American upper-middle income country, as a case-study to measure the expected number of
deaths without and with social interventions. We therefore use an age-structured transmission
dynamics model, in which the infected population goes through compartments of disease and can
end either recover or die (Extended Data Fig. 1). This model was fitted and calibrated with

empirical data (i.e. calibration targets) from Italy, Wuhan (China), the United States, and
Colombia, using the following parameters:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

The age-specific adjusted symptomatic case-fatality rate in China8.
The age-specific crude symptomatic case-fatality rate in Italy9.
The age-specific hospitalization rate given symptomatic in the United States10
The cumulative deaths in Italy11.
The cumulative number of critical care admissions in Italy11.
The cumulative number of hospital admissions in Italy11.
The cumulative cases in Wuhan (China)8.

We chose very specific data-points to analyze trends to include unsuppressed or unmitigated
transmission dynamics (see Methods). These calibration targets were optimized using a bounded
optimization algorithm for 200 starting values to obtain the 33 free parameters calibrated in the
model: the age-specific probabilities of symptoms, hospitalization, critical care admission, and
death while in critical care, along with the per capita transmission rate. We further used COVID19 case data from Colombia to select the best set of parameters to fit this epidemiological model.
The resulting cumulative attack rate in the first 12 months in the calibrated model we formulated
was 83%, for an R0 of 2.12, in line with previous empirical studies estimating the R0 of COVID19 between 2 and 312,13.
Colombia, a country of approximately 50 million people, had 1,406 cases and 32 deaths by April
4, 202014. The best fitting parameters in calibration suggest the percentage of asymptomatic
people in the entire age-distribution of Colombia is 73%. This percentage of asymptomatic is
similar to previous studies using both mathematical models and Chinese empirical data on the
asymptomatic percentage of COVID-19 in close contacts15,16. A total of 60% of the population
older than 60 years in the present model were symptomatic (Extended data Fig. 2).
Under the fitted transmission parameters, Colombia can expect 288.8 deaths per 100,000 pop.
without any social intervention, with 83% of all deaths occurring among people >60 years old
(Fig. 1). This estimate does not include the likely additional mortality effect of overwhelmed
healthcare facilities during the peak of the epidemic.
One-time social interventions will not permanently reduce transmission
The model predicts that a one-time social intervention lasting three or four months will not
suppress or mitigate COVID-19 during a year, but will delay the epidemic peak for the time this
one-time intervention is implemented. Our results suggest that applying social distance, work
distance, and schools/universities closure for three or four months can suppress or mitigate
transmission while implemented, but will not lead to elimination of COVID-19 transmission
(Table and Fig.1). Whilst social interventions can better prepare the healthcare system for the
pandemic, after lifting the intervention, we predict that COVID-19 will continue its spread in the
population, producing a similar attack rate and deaths reduced between 0.3% and 0.7% (Table
and Fig. 2).
Intermittent suppression and mitigation will reduce up to 97% of deaths

We simulated a similar scenario to the report of Ferguson et al.4 We used triggers of action, in
which achieving 50, 100, or 150 daily admissions to critical care in Colombia will trigger a
social intervention for a week, after which the intervention is evaluated every week until the
number of critical care admissions is above the trigger.
We estimate that a combination of school closures, social distancing, and work distancing may
reduce deaths by 97% with a trigger of action of 50 critical care admission in a day. This
combination of interventions would have to be active for at least 81% of the year (around 10
months) (Extended Data Fig. 3). A trigger of 100 critical admissions with all these interventions
would reduce deaths by 93%, while this reduction is 92% for 150 admissions, and 200
admissions the death reduction was 90%.
A combination of social interventions after a trigger of 50 critical admissions will decrease the
cumulative infection attack rate in a year from 83% to a range between 6-36%. (Table, Fig. 3,
and Extended Data Fig. 3). We predict that social distancing alone, will result in one peak, and
will reduce the COVID-19 mortality rate by 23% (Table, Fig. 3, and Extended Data Fig. 4).
We also estimate that the effective reproductive number will be reduced to less than 1 after 70
days since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, or within a week since starting all the social nonpharmacological interventions, and with a trigger of 50 critical care admissions in a day
(Extended Data Fig. 5). Using a trigger of 100 critical care admissions in a day would result in a
lower effective reproductive number to less than 1 after 77 days, and within a week of starting
the home, work, school, and social distancing.
Limitations
Our analysis is a mathematical simulation containing several assumptions (see Methods). In
addition, our fitting is as good as the quality of the target data from China, the United States, and
Italy we used to calibrate the simulation. Our model assumptions reflect key parameters for
which there is not enough good quality data. One of the most important parameters changing the
overall results in sensitivity analysis was the number of days an asymptomatic person is
infectious. We assumed five days as the length of this period. In Panel C of Fig. 1 the
asymptomatic infectious time is the second parameter that would change results the most, and for
which there is not much empirical data. Other parameters calibrated to data result in an
epidemiological profile for COVID-19 in the model compared to empirical data of China, Italy,
and the United States (Extended data Fig. 2). We also assume immunity after COVID-19
infection for the length of the simulation (18 months in Extended data Fig. 3 and Extended
data Fig. 4).
Our calibration targets come from countries with a different age-structure compared to
Colombia, an upper-middle income country. While some of our calibration targets are agestratified, the cumulative trend of hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths in Italy is
an aggregate of the population, potentially increasing the curve of severe cases in the base model
scenario. This also means that parameters from China, Italy, and the United States are less robust
in middle-aged population, producing more uncertainty in our estimations.

For low- and middle-income countries, the need of good quality empirical data is important to
increase the level of evidence in the decision-making process, good quality data is needed as the
pandemic spreads worldwide.
Conclusions
Although our analyses estimate the expected burden of COVID-19 in a middle-income country
with and without non-pharmacological social interventions, COVID-19 is still an evolving
situation worldwide, and many uncertainties remain for this disease. Our analyses take the
experience of China, Italy, and the United States, and attempt to provide a rough guide of
interventions to prevent these adverse outcomes in an upper-middle income country like
Colombia. The governments worldwide should consider economic and other societal
externalities resulting from the implementation of these trigger thresholds and series of
interventions.
Our analyses provide decision-makers from middle-income, and potentially in poor economies,
with evidence and data to base their decisions. While the trigger of 50 critical care admissions
was effective in Colombia to prevent deaths, the trigger value would depend on the available
critical care units of each country.

Methods

We developed a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) to simulate the expected
number of infections, cases, hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths resulting from
the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ODE model
The ODE model follows the Colombian population in 16 age-groups (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 2024, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, and 75+), through
nine compartments: 1) susceptible; 2) exposed; 3) symptomatic infectious; 4) asymptomatic
infectious; 5) complicated symptomatic (at homecare) infectious; 6) complicated hospitalized
(isolated) not infectious; 7) complicated needing critical care (isolated) not infectious; 8)
recovered from symptomatic infection; and 9) recovered from complicated infection.
The model follows a hypothetical cohort of an age-stratified population in Colombia every day
for a year, assuming the population of 2020. When the susceptible population is exposed,
persons can go to the symptomatic or asymptomatic compartment. If asymptomatic, the person is
assumed to recover in the base scenario in five days; while if symptomatic, the population can go
to home isolation and then recover, or go into hospitalization. A person hospitalized can either
recover or go to the critical care unit. Finally, people in critical care can either die of COVID-19
or go to the recover compartment (Extended Data Fig. 1). The ODE mode includes births in the
susceptible compartment and all-cause mortality in all compartments, except in critical care and
the death compartments.
The ODE model uses Colombian age-specific contact rates from a previous study17 to fit the
force of infection. All models and analyses were made in R (v3.6.3).
The ODE system is represented by the following equations:

Where the fixed parameters are: 1/l is the incubation time (5 days) 13,18, time in complicated

(assumed as 5 days), 1/y is the time while symptomatic and infectious (assumed as 5 days), 1/u
time in critical care (5 days)13, 1/o is time hospitalized (5 days)13, µ is the all-cause mortality rate
in Colombia19, and α is the birth rate (13,2 per 1,000 pop.)19 All these values were parametrized
per day. The free calibrated parameters were the per-capita transmission rate (ꞵ) (for all agegroups); and the age-specific probability of symptoms given infected (s), hospitalization
probability (h), critical care probability (c), and death rate while in critical care (d) (in eight agegroups, 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+). In the model, c is the contact rate
per day, at age i, with a contact of age j.
The ODE model makes the following assumptions:
1. The infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows the pattern shown by the classical ODE
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model.
2. The population follows the age-distribution of Colombia, and the contact rate we used to
simulate contacts between age-groups is an accurate report of the contacts in this country.
3. The immunity of COVID-19 infectious lasts for 18 months at least (the length of the
simulation in this report).
4. The incubation period lasts an average of five days, according to previous studies in
China13,18.
5. The model assumes one index case starts the epidemic, and no other importation occurs
for the length of the modeled time horizon.
6. Asymptomatic transmission is also assumed to occur in this model, as previously
reported20.

Calibration of the ODE model
The model was calibrated using the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm for derivative-free optimization. We
used seven calibration targets plus a comparison with Colombian data, to match the dynamics of
the ODE model. We used 200 starting values, randomly assigned using latin hypercube
sampling. We compared observed versus predicted values with log-likelihoods using the
binomial distribution, finding the best fitting set of targets for the country
The calibration of the ODE model used the following targets:
1. Age-specific adjusted symptomatic case-fatality rate by age in China8.
2. Age-specific crude symptomatic case-fatality rate by age in Italy9.
3. Age-specific hospitalization probability in the United States10. The data was in different
age-groups for this calibration target, we therefore modeled the gaps of the percentage
hospitalized between age-groups with a four-degree polynomial linear regression.
4. Cumulative deaths in Italy11, starting from the date of ten deaths until either 15 days have
passed after first case detected or the lockdown in March 9, 2020
5. The cumulative number of critical care admissions in Italy11, starting from the date of 50
critical care admissions until either 15 days have passed after the first case detected or the
start of the lockdown.
6. The cumulative number of hospital admissions in Italy11. Starting from the date of 150
hospitalizations until either 15 days have passed after the first case detected or the start of
the lockdown.
7. Cumulative cases in Wuhan (China)8, From the date ten cumulative cases are detected,
until either 45 days have passed or the start of the lockdown in Wuhan in January 23,
2020.
Each of these 200 set of parameters, from the same number of starting values, was fitted again to
calculate the difference between simulated and observed case data in Colombia before the
lockdown on March 20 of 202014 (Extended data Fig. 6).

Calculation of R0
We approximated the R0 by using the formula by Dietz (1993)21:
𝑅0 = −

𝑙𝑛(1 − 𝑎)
𝑎

Where a is the attack rate. This formula assumes homogeneous mixing and a closed population.
The R0 for our calibrated model was 2.12, according to the approximation using the attack rate

We also included an estimation of the effective reproductive value (Rt), according to formulas by
Cori et al. (2013)22, used in the R package EpiEstim (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Contact matrices and simulated interventions
We used the Prem et al. (2017) estimation of contact matrices for Colombia17. These contact
matrices are composed of four matrices (home, work, school, and other contacts).
We simulated five interventions with these matrices:
− School closures: We changed all school contacts to zero.
− Social distance: We assumed the matrix of other contacts are reduced by 80% (contacts
other than home, work or work).
− School closures and social distance: We simulated the outcomes of reducing work contact
by 70% and increase contacts of individuals of the same age (50% for persons <20 years
of age and 10% for the other age-groups), as reported by Prem et al.17
− Work distancing: We assumed 80% of the working population would reduce a 50% their
contact during work.
For the triggered interventions, we assumed the data on critical care admissions was evaluated on
the fifth day of each week. Each of these social intervention lasts one week, where it was
evaluated again every week until the critical care admissions per day were lower than the
selected trigger.

Data availability
All data used for the present study is open data. Readers wishing to replicate the study can access
the data under a reasonable request to the corresponding author.

Code availability
The models were made with R (v3.6.2), using the deSolve package (v1.28) with compiled code
in C. The C code for the function to run the ODE model is shown in the Supplementary
Appendix. We ran the analysis in a Windows 10 computer, Core i9 of 8th generation of 6C/12T.
Each of the ODE model simulations ran in ~0.5 seconds. We additionally used the packages
EPiEstim (v2.2-1), dfoptim (v2018.2-1), matrixStats (v0.5.5.0), tidyverse (v1.3.0) scales (1.0.0),
gridExtra (v2.3), parallel (v3.6.2), foreach (v1.4.7), doParallel (v1.0.15), and foreign (v.0.8-72).
The entire code for replicability can be requested to the corresponding author and will be
published in www.covid19app.care.
