Abstract
The testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR analyses can be substantially increased
by using pooling techniques. Here we discuss two important consequences of this. First,
prevalence estimation can be done with a very limited number of RT-PCR analysis. Second,
for screening purposes, the number of detected cases can largely increased.

Efficient Prevalence Estimation and Population Screening for SARS-CoV-2
Introduction
The most common testing method for SARS-CoV-2 is RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal
and/or throat swab samples. In most countries, testing capacity is highly limited due to lack of
equipment and necessary testing reagents. Consequently, some laboratories have explored
pooling techniques to increase the number of individuals tested with the available number of
tests.1 At Stavanger University Hospital we have operationally verified the possibility of
pooling eight samples with maintained diagnostic sensitivity. We would like to draw the
attention to two, maybe less obvious, opportunities enabled by pooling of up to 32 or even
more samples that appear to be possible within the PCR protocol recommended by WHO for
SARS-CoV-2 detection.
SARS-CoV-2 prevalence measurement with minimal number of PCR tests
Determination of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population is of high importance for a
number of reasons. For instance, the “true” prevalence is a crucial input to epidemiologic
modelling, and for monitoring the effect of social distancing and other measures to suppress
spread of SARS-CoV-2.2 By single-step pooled analysis, the number of PCR analyses
necessary is reduced by a factor equal to the number of samples in each pool. An estimate of
the prevalence can be calculated from the proportion of positive pools; it is not necessary to
identify the exact number of positive samples in each pool. The technique is well described in
the literature3–5 and corrects for the possibility that there is more than one positive sample in
each positive pool. Details about tools and methods are given in the supplementary material.
To further reduce the number of required PCR analyses, a higher degree of pooling can be
employed, even if the corresponding reduction in sensitivity would be considered
unacceptable for diagnostic purposes. For prevalence estimation the reduced sensitivity is,
however, straightforward to correct for, as long as it is known. Yelin et al.1 have indicated
that with pooling of 32 samples the sensitivity is 90% (10% false negative rate), relative to
that of single sample analysis. With this degree of pooling it would take 200 PCR tests to
estimate the prevalence from a dataset of 6400 individual samples. Figure S1 in the
supplementary material indicates the 90% confidence intervals for various sample sizes,
degree of pooling and prevalences.
Maximizing the number of detected cases when screening in a low prevalence population
The most common purpose of pooled testing is to analyze as many samples as possible with a
given laboratory capacity and maintain a diagnostic level of sensitivity. Further, to combat the
current covid-19 epidemic many countries are adapting a “suppression” strategy as
recommended by Ferguson et al. 2 and WHO.6 The basic idea of this strategy is, after a period
of aggressive social distancing measures, to do extensive testing, case tracing and isolation to
keep the prevalence at a low level until a vaccine becomes available. In this context it is
important to maximize the number of infected people detected with the available testing
resources, rather than to insist that all tests from the community setting are being performed
with the highest level of sensitivity. Currently, the limited literature indicates that with a pool
size of 32 the sensitivity drops to around 90%.1 When used for population screening pooling
of 32 samples will nevertheless allow for detection of far more infected people than for the
same number of PCR tests if using one test per person. If screening a population with a
prevalence of 0.005 and using pooling of eight samples a mean of around 6000 people can be

screened and a mean of 30 cases detected using 1000 PCR tests. By pooling 32 samples,
however, around 12000 people can be screened and a mean of 55 cases detected with the
same 1000 PCR tests. Figure S2 shows the corresponding numbers for a range of prevalence
values in the screened population. It appears that if using this approach some high-income
countries already would have the PCR capacity needed to perform extensive screening of the
public, if the prevalence is first suppressed to a low level with strong social distancing
measures.
Limitations of both of the above suggested applications of extended pooling is that while the
required number of PCR analysis is reduced, the number of samples to be collected is
unchanged. Further, the relationship between pool size and test sensitivity is not yet fully
established and might also vary between individual laboratories and various PCR protocols,
and therefore have to be verified locally.

column of the plot). Note that the number of pools needed to be analyzed is the number of persons divided by the degree of pooling. The calculations assume a pool analysis sensitivity as shown in Figure S3.

Screening
Figure S2 shows how many persons can be included in the screening and the expected number of infected
persons identified for three different screening strategies. The first strategy is to do no pooling. The
second strategy is to first test samples in pools of 8. For the pools that are positive, samples from all 8
persons are tested individually. In the third strategy samples are first tested in pools of 32. For pools
that are positive a second test in 8 pools of size 4 are made. Then finally for the positive pools of 4,
individual tests are run.

Figure S2: The left plots depicts the number of persons that could be tested and the right plots the
expected number of infected persons that would be identified with two different PCR budgets and three
different test strategies: 1) No pooling; 2) Pool size 8 in the first testing and re-testing of all samples
in the positive pools; 3) Pool size 32 in the first testing, re-testing in pools of 4 for the positive pools,
re-testing all for the positive pools of size 4.
In the illustrations shown in Figure S2 we have assumed a sensitivity of 99% for pools of size 8 and a
sensitivity of 90% for pools of size 32. Similar plots for other scenarios can be generated using the R code
in the GitHub repository. Note that both the numbers of persons included and the expected number of
cases identified scale linearly with the number of available PCR analyses. For 1000 analyses the numbers
are five times that of 200 analyses.

Mathematical details
Let p be the true prevalence, k the number of samples merged in one pool and π(k) the probability that
a pool of k tests is positive. Let further s(k) be the sensitivity of the test for a pool of k tests. We
assume the specificity of the test to be 1. Then
π(k) = s(k)(1 − (1 − p)k ).

(1)

Prevalence estimation For prevalence estimation, p, we first estimate π(k) by
π̂(k) =

N+
N

(2)

where N+ is the number of positive pools and N is the number of pools. The total number of persons
tested is npers = kN . From (1) and (2) we get that

p̂ = 1 − 1 −

.
s(k)
s(k)N

(3)

Moreover, to obtain a confidence interval for p̂ we propose to first calculate Wilson confidence intervals 1
for π̂(k) and map this to confidence limits for p̂ by inserting the upper and lower limits in (3). Wilson
confidence intervals are available from the binom.confint function in the R package binom 2,3 . Additional statistical tools for computing prevalences from pooled samples can be found in the prevalence
package 4,5 .
Screening strategies For considerations around the screening strategies let first NP CR be the total
number of PCR analyses which needs to be performed and let NP CR,1 be the number of PCR analyses
run in the first round. With no pooling NP CR = NP CR,1 . For pooling stratgies NP CR will be a random
variable since we do not know how many positive pools we will find. For the strategy with pooling of 8
samples we have
E(NP CR ) = NP CR,1 + NP CR,1 · π(8)8

⇒

NP CR,1 =

E(NP CR )
.
1 + π(8)8

By inserting the budget of available PCR analyses for E(NP CR ) (e.g. 200 and 1000 in Figure S2) we get
that the total number of persons that can be tested is npers = 8NP CR,1 . Let npos be the total number
of identified positive cases, and let npos,8 denote the number of positive cases in a pool of 8. Then
E(npos ) = NP CR,1 · π(8) E(npos,8 |npos,8 ≥ 1) =
3

NP CR,1 · π(8)8p
.
(1 − p)8

For the strategy starting with 32 pools then re-testing in pools of 4 if positive and finally testing all
samples in positive pools of 4, similar calculations give.
NP CR,1 =

E(NP CR )
.
1 + π(32)(8 + 4 E(X|npos,32 ≥ 1))

Here X is the number of positive pools among eight pools of size 4, and E(X|npos,32 ≥ 1) can be
approximated by

The last two terms k=4 kP (npos,32 = k) + 8P (npos,32 ≥ 8) implies that this is an upper bound, the
approximation being very accurate for small p. Finally, we get the expected number of detections by
E(npos ) = NP CR,1 · π(32) E(npos,32 |npos,32 ≥ 1) =
