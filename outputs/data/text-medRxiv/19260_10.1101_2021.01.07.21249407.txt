ABSTRACT
Objectives: The risk of myocardial damage after severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been controversial. There is an urgent need for data
to support the appropriate level of cardiovascular screening for safe return-to-play. The purpose
of this study is to report the incidence of abnormal cardiovascular findings in National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods: This is a case series of student-athletes at a single NCAA Division I institution who
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody testing (IgG)
from 4/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. From 452 athletes who were screened, 5,124 PCR and 452
antibody tests were completed. Student-athletes were followed through 12/31/2020 (median 104
days, range 64-182 days). Cardiac work-up included clinical evaluation, troponin level,
electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Additional work-up was ordered as clinically
indicated.
Results: 55 student-athletes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 38 (69%) had
symptoms of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), 14 (26%) had a positive IgG test, and 41 (74%)
had a positive PCR test. Eight abnormal cardiovascular screening evaluations necessitated
further testing including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). Two athletes received
new cardiac diagnoses, one probable early cardiomyopathy and one pericarditis, while the
remaining six had normal cardiac MRIs.
Conclusion: These data support recent publications which recommend the de-escalation of
cardiovascular testing for athletes who have recovered from asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Continued follow-up of these athletes for sequelae of
SARS-CoV-2 is critical.

INTRODUCTION
With the return of athletic competitions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the repercussions of
infection are still being investigated. Several early studies suggested high rates of cardiac
involvement including one cardiac MRI study showing rates of longer term cardiac injury as high
as 78%.[1] In the collegiate student-athlete population, a recent cohort study by Rajpal et al. of
26 competitive collegiate athletes with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 or mild COVID-19 infections
and normal echocardiograms found that 4/26 (15%) had cardiac MRI findings consistent with
myocarditis based on the updated Lake Louise criteria.[2] Another cohort study of collegiate
student-athletes by Brito et al. found that 56.3% had abnormal findings on echocardiogram and
cardiac MRI.[3] However, a study of 18 professional soccer players with a previous history of
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection yielded no signs of cardiac
involvement after resting and stress-test ECGs, holter monitoring, echocardiogram, chest CT,
and cardiac MRI.[4]
One published expert opinion on cardiac screening for return-to-play after symptomatic COVID19 infection recommended resting ECG, troponin assay, and 2-D echocardiogram.[5]
Consensus opinions were subsequently revised for the collegiate athlete population, with the
recommendation for routine cardiovascular testing after mildly symptomatic infections
removed.[6] Multiple other groups have published expert recommendations, but there have
been few studies to date validating any of these approaches.[7–15] We present a cohort study
of 55 collegiate student-athletes with a history of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic[5] SARSCoV-2 infection and their subsequent cardiac work-up. The goal of the present study was to
determine if current published recommendations were appropriate for detecting post-infection
cardiac sequelae.
METHODS
Detection of SARS-CoV-2
This prospective observational study included all varsity student-athletes returning to campus
from 6/15/2020 to 10/31/2020. A total of 452 student-athletes were included in the study. Upon
arrival to campus, all student-athletes underwent serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody
(EuroImmun ELISA)[16] and nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate testing via PCR (Hologic Panther
Fusion)[17] for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Student-athletes continued to be tested via
surveillance PCR testing one to three times weekly or immediately upon development of any
potential COVID-19 symptoms including fever or chills, shortness of breath, sore throat, loss of
smell/taste, headache, congestion, chest pain, and cough. All SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ studentathletes were immediately placed in isolation, and symptoms, temperature, and oxygen

saturation were recorded daily. Additionally, any student-athlete identified as a potential close
contact of a confirmed PCR+ individual was placed in a 14-day quarantine and received
COVID-19 PCR testing on days 5 and 12 post-exposure.
Cardiac Screening Protocol
All PCR+ or IgG+ student-athletes underwent cardiac screening after completion of a ten-day
isolation period or upon return to campus if they had tested PCR+ while at home. Asymptomatic
individuals with IgG+/PCR- did not complete an isolation period. The cardiovascular screening
protocol consisted of a resting 12-lead ECG, troponin-I measurement (Dimension ExL;
Siemens; normal <0.055 ng/mL), two-dimensional echocardiogram with doppler, and sports
cardiologist consultation. Further testing such as cardiac MRI, ambulatory rhythm monitoring,
and cardiopulmonary exercise testing with exercise ECG was at the discretion of the consulting
cardiologist. After student-athletes completed the cardiac screening protocol and were cleared
by the team physician, they began a gradual return to sport with close monitoring for exercise
limitations or recurrent symptoms.
Patient and Public Involvement
Patients and public were not involved in the design or conduct of the study and did not
participate in the analysis of data.
RESULTS
Screening and Surveillance Protocol Outcomes
Among the 452 student-athletes who returned to campus starting in June 2020 (Figure 1), there
were 14 (3.1%) positive and 438 negative antibody tests. 5124 PCR tests were conducted
during the study period; 41 (0.8%) were positive and 5083 were negative. Of the 14 IgG+
student-athletes, two recalled loss of smell/taste, three recalled mild upper respiratory
symptoms, and nine had no recollection of any COVID-19 symptoms since February 2020. Of
the 41 PCR+ student-athletes, 12 were identified on routine surveillance testing, 21 were tested
due to symptoms including 12 student-athletes who were tested while at home away from
campus, and eight were tested as part of the contact tracing/quarantine protocol. Eight of the 41
(19.5%) were asymptomatic. No student-athlete had moderate symptoms[6] or required
hospitalization.
Post-Infection Cardiac Screening
Two of the 14 IgG+ student-athletes had an abnormal initial cardiac work-up, both consisting of
a normal ECG/troponin and an abnormal echocardiogram (Figure 2); one received an abnormal

cardiac diagnosis. This particular student-athlete’s echocardiogram showed a mild reduction in
LV and moderate reduction in RV function (no prior echo available). There was no evidence of
myocarditis on cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI confirmed mild biventricular dysfunction as seen on
echo. There was no evidence of change in ventricular function on serial imaging over 3 months
of follow-up. After further testing and sports cardiology consultation, early cardiomyopathy was
diagnosed, thought to be unrelated to his SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Six out of the 41 PCR+ student-athletes had an abnormal initial cardiac work-up (Figure 2),
consisting of one with an isolated positive troponin, three abnormal ECGs with abnormal echos,
and three normal ECGs with abnormal echos (Figure 2). Only one PCR+ student-athlete, who
had mild symptoms of sore throat, cough, and congestion at the time of his infection, received
an abnormal cardiac diagnosis of pericarditis. He subsequently admitted to having chest pain on
exertion prior to receiving clearance to exercise. Interestingly, two months prior to contracting
SARS-CoV-2, this student-athlete had ventricular ectopy on resting ECG. At that time, resting
echocardiogram was normal. Post-COVID-19 cardiac work-up redemonstrated ventricular
ectopy on ECG, but there was a new small pericardial effusion on echocardiogram and cMRI.
There was no evidence of myocarditis on cMRI.
Of the 55 PCR+ or IgG+ student-athletes, 13 (23.6%) had changes on echocardiogram
reflective of left ventricular remodeling and athletic heart syndrome (AHS). Seven of these 13
student-athletes had a prior echocardiogram which allowed for direct comparison to determine if
additional cardiac work-up was indicated. All student-athletes have returned to exercise and
athletic activity without complication as of December 31, 2020.
DISCUSSION
Our study presents the largest cohort to date of collegiate athletes undergoing a post-COVID-19
cardiac screening program. In contrast to studies among community populations, there was a
relatively low incidence of cardiac involvement in this young cohort who were asymptomatic or
experienced mild symptoms. Second, transiently elevated troponin levels and new abnormal
ECG findings did not represent acute myocarditis as assessed by cMRI. Finally, there was a
high frequency of left ventricular remodeling representing AHS; this highlights the importance of
baseline evaluation in collegiate athletes.
Evaluation in Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Cases
Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, published recommendations included early evaluation of
athletes who experience symptomatic infection with ECG, troponin, and echocardiography.[5]

Data presented by both Puntmann et al.[1] in unselected patients and Rajpal et al.[2] in
competitive athletes highlighted an increased rate of cMRI findings suggestive of myocarditis in
those with symptomatic COVID-19. However, in the absence of associated symptoms or
abnormal cardiovascular diagnostics to meet clinical criteria for myocarditis,[18] it is unclear if
these changes lead to a poor prognosis.[19] These findings present a significant challenge in
the development of an athletic screening program for COVID-19 positive athletes. Abnormal
findings on cardiac MRI have been reported in up to 50% of asymptomatic athletes,[20] and due
to the current prevalence of COVID-19, widespread use of cMRI among athletes is not feasible.
Furthermore, the cardiac screening process may result in the detection of abnormalities which
do not represent pathology, possibly causing increased stress and delaying return to
competition. In order to address these challenges, we developed a screening program which
combines severity of disease with detailed cardiovascular system review and implemented a
graded approach to the use of cardiovascular diagnostics.
There are very limited data to support or refute the need for comprehensive cardiovascular
evaluation in athletes who test positive for SARS-COV-2 but are asymptomatic or have mild
symptoms. A report of 30 professional soccer players screened with blood tests, spirometry,
ECG, echocardiogram, and stress ECG did not identify clinically relevant anomalies.[4] Data
from an Italian professional soccer team suggested a limited role for troponin post-COVID-19
infection.[21] Our data on a relatively large cohort of athletes supports these studies, suggesting
a limited role for extensive evaluation in athletes who experience no symptoms or mild
symptoms. Within our cohort, one student-athlete had an elevated circulating troponin,
proceeded to cMRI, and had no evidence of active myocarditis. Circulating troponin has been
shown to be elevated among athletes post-endurance activity,[22–24] and its detection does not
always represent cardiac pathology. This individual exercised the morning of the blood draw,
which may have led to the abnormal result. Two student-athletes with new ECG findings
proceeded to cMRI, which showed no evidence of acute or past myocarditis. These data appear
to support more recent expert consensus recommendations,[6] suggesting a limited role for
cardiovascular testing following asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection
among student-athletes. Continued follow-up of athletes with abnormal cardiovascular studies
despite normal cMRI is required to understand the implication of these results.
Building an Athletic Screening Program
The role of pre-participation cardiac testing with ECG and echocardiogram in young athletes is
controversial.[25,26] All matriculated student-athletes in our cohort had a baseline ECG and
those on the American football, basketball, and volleyball teams had a baseline

echocardiogram. The high incidence of exercise-induced cardiac remodeling added to the
complexity in using echocardiography after SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly as one of the
findings of myocarditis is a reduction in LV function.[18] The availability of previous
echocardiographic studies in a subset of our student-athletes as part of our pre-participation
screening program allowed us to determine if this cardiac remodeling pre-dated their infection,
and ultimately reduced the number of cMRIs needed. In the absence of baseline imaging,
overreading imaging studies by a team experienced in sports cardiology may help avoid
unnecessary investigation or exclusion from training.[27]
Limitations
Despite being the largest published cohort to date of collegiate student-athletes undergoing
post-COVID-19 cardiac screening, our study is still relatively small with limited follow up.
Ambulatory rhythm monitoring is recommended in several expert consensus statements, but
was not a standard part of our protocol and to our knowledge there is insufficient published data
available supporting its routine use in post-COVID-19 cardiac screening. No athlete within our
cohort experienced severe COVID-19 symptoms or required hospitalization. The vast majority of
student-athletes had previous cardiovascular diagnostics, including 52/55 with a prior ECG and
20/55 with a prior resting echocardiogram available for direct comparison, which helped in
interpreting borderline and abnormal findings. The three cases without prior ECGs were firstyear student-athletes who had tested positive at home prior to matriculation and had not yet had
their pre-participation exam. This cardiovascular screening occurred at a resource-rich
institution with an established pre-participation program, and thus these findings may not be
practical or representative for all young athletes.
CONCLUSION
We present data from a relatively large sample of collegiate athletes who tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 during an athletic screening program. In athletes presenting with asymptomatic or
mildly symptomatic infections, the rate of cardiac involvement appeared low. The availability of
baseline ECGs and echocardiograms was helpful in determining if abnormalities were sequelae
of infection. Supportive of recent expert consensus statements, there were no SARS-CoV-2
related cardiac diagnoses in asymptomatic student-athletes. However, larger studies and
ongoing follow-up for longer term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 are vital to the validation of our
current conclusions.

In contrast to studies performed in community populations post SARS-CoV-2 infection,
among a collegiate athletic population who were asymptomatic or experienced mild
symptoms, there was a low incidence of cardiac involvement.
A high frequency of left ventricular remodeling among collegiate athletes, as assessed
by echocardiography, highlights the usefulness of baseline evaluation.
ECG abnormalities and an abnormal troponin did not represent myocarditis as assessed
by cardiac MRI.

How might this affect future practice?
- There appears to be a limited role for extensive cardiovascular diagnostics in collegiate
athletes post asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Larger studies with longitudinal follow-up are required to validate these findings and
assess long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in athletes.
