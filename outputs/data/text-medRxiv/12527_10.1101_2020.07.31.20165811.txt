Abstract We used the COVID-19 dataset obtained from the Our World in Data website and
investigated the associations between COVID-19 CFR and nine country-level indices of 209
countries/territories using the Matern correlation regression model. Spatial dependence among
the data was controlled using the latitude and longitude of the centroid of the
countries/territories. Stratified analyses were conducted by economic level and COVID-19
testing policy. The average of country/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2-3%
worldwide, which is higher than previously reported at 0.7-1.3%. Statistically significant
associations were observed between COVID-19 CFR and population size and proportion of
female smokers. The open testing policies are associated with decreased CFR. Strictness of
anti-COVID-19 measures was not statistically significantly associated with CFR overall, but
the higher stringency index was associated with higher CFR in higher income countries with
active testing policies. The statistically significant association between population size and
COVID-19 CRF suggests the healthcare strain and lower treatment efficiency in countries
with large populations. The observed association between smoking in females and COVID-19
CFR might be due to that the proportion of female smokers reflected broadly income level of
a country. When testing is warranted and healthcare resources are sufficient, strict quarantine
and/or lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in underprivileged populations.

Introduction
The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2
Virus/COVID-19), which was initially reported in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei province in
China in December 2019, has become a major global health concern (Margallo IIet al. 2020).
Poor outcomes in those with COVID19 infections correlate with clinical and laboratory
features of cytokine storm syndrome, an exaggerated systemic inflammatory phenomenon due
to over-production of proinflammatory cytokines by the immune system that results in diffuse
inflammatory lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Hendersonet al. 2020). It
may be complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), and subsequent multi-organ failure (Zaimet al. 2020). Although COVID-19 related
deaths are not clearly defined in the international reports available so far, many governments
are warning people to be particularly stringent in following the recommended prevention
measures because COVID-19 may results in severe conditions that need critical care
including ventilation or death (Jordanet al. 2020). Till the end of June, 2020, the pandemic has
resulted in over 10 million confirmed cases and 500 thousand deaths worldwide
(Worldometer 2020). COVID-19 related fatality rates are difficult to assess with certainty, but
according to the estimates based on the data from China, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the
Diamond Princess cruise ship, the overall death rate from the confirmed COVID-19 cases is
around 0.7-1.3%, with a sharply rising from less than 0.002% in children aged 9 years or
younger to 8% in people aged over 80, which is much greater than seasonal influenza at about
0.1% (Baudet al. 2020; Jordanet al. 2020; Mahase 2020; Onderet al. 2020; Rajgoret al. 2020;
Russellet al. 2020).
During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous studies on the global public health emergency
have covered a significant range of disciplines including medicine, mathematics and social
sciences. The spatial spread is one of the most important properties of COVID-19, a

characteristic which mainly depends on the epidemic mechanism, human mobility, and
control strategy (Grosset al. 2020). Spatial statistical methods are frequently used to uncover
relationships between spatiotemporal patterns of infectious diseases and host or
environmental characteristics (Lawson 2013), generate detailed maps to visualize the
distribution of the diseases’ morbidity or mortality (Palk and Blower 2018; Zuluet al. 2014),
and identify hotspots, clusters, and potential risk factors (Anselinet al. 2006; Kulldorff and
Nagarwalla 1995; Pfeifferet al. 2008; Sasakiet al. 2008).
Clinical risk factors for mortality of adult patients with COVID-19 have been investigated in
numerous studies, and the identified factors include older age (Brooke and Jackson 2020),
male sex (Jinet al. 2020), higher sequential organ failure assessment score (Zhouet al. 2020),
obesity (Klanget al. 2020; Zhanget al. 2020), preexisting concurrent diabetes (Guoet al. 2020),
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular (Duet al. 2020), and kidney diseases (Chenget al. 2020b), and
macro-economic and environmental risk factors such as socioeconomic deprivation (BibbinsDomingo 2020), air pollution (Ogen 2020; Wuet al. 2020) and diurnal temperature variation
(Maet al. 2020), etc. However, there is a lack of published studies on the effects of
demographic and socioeconomic factors on COVID-10 case-fatality rates at the population
level. It is an important issue for governments and regional or international non-governmental
organizations to identify country characteristics that are associated with high case fatality rate
(CRF) and help developing prevention and intervention measures to fight against this global
public health crisis.
Using the publicly available data from the non-governmental organization Our World in Data
(Our World in Data 2020a), we aimed to investigate the relationship of key country level
demographic and socioeconomic indices and COVID-19 case-fatality, and explore factors
associated with CFR, which may indicate treatment efficiency and strain in healthcare

locations.
The data used in the study are freely available in the open source for research. There are no
individual data available in the dataset. The owner of the data gives the permission to use,
distribute, and reproduce the data in any medium. Therefore, no private and confidential
information could be disclosed in the study, and ethical approval is not applicable. In the
study, estimates of health indicators at the global level were reported according to the
GATHER statement (Supplemental material 1) (Stevenset al. 2016).

Results
Descriptive characteristics of the variables
In total, 209 countries and territories and 17 variables (including latitude and longitude) were
included in the study. The descriptive statistics of the variables are shown in Tables 1. The
pairwise relationships of the variables are shown in Figure 1. High multicollinearity was
found between number of confirmed cases and population size (pairwise Pearson’s r = 0.76, P
< 0.001, Figure 1), and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and life expectancy, median
age, proportion of aged 65 years or older, proportion of extreme poverty, and hospital beds
per 1000 people (all pairwise Pearson’s r greater than or approximate to 0.70, and P < 0.001,
Figure 1; multiple correlation coefficient = 0.92, P < 0.001). Therefore, median age,
proportion of aged 65 or older, and hospital beds per 1000 people were excluded in later
regression analysis. Although proportion of extreme poverty is an interesting factor to be
investigated, it is highly correlated with GDP per capita (r = -0.83) and the latter is available
in more countries, therefore proportion of extreme poverty was also excluded from analysis.

Spatial autocorrelation of the COVID-19 CFR
Statistically significant spatial autocorrelation was found among the countries/territories’
COVID-19 case-fatality rates. The residuals from the common (non-spatial) multivariate
linear regression models show apparent spatial dependence around the countries/territories
with high fatality (Figure 3). The P-value from the Moran's I test for the spatial
autocorrelation of the residuals is 2.32×10-5.

The estimated spatial autocorrelation coefficient of COVID-19 case-fatality rates between two
locations against their distance is shown in Figure 4, with a strength parameter ν of 2.48 and a
decay parameter ρ of 0.12. Basically, locations more than 20 degrees (in longitude or latitude)
away have an autocorrelation coefficient below 0.5 (Figure 4).

Associations of demographic and socioeconomic variables with COVID-19 CFR
Overall, after controlling for the spatial dependence, the statistically significant variables
associated with COVID-19 case-fatality rate are population size and proportion of female
smokers in a country/region (Table 2). The multivariate adjusted results indicate that,
approximately, a doubling in size of population is associated with 0.48 (95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.25, 0.70) percent increase in COVID-19 case-fatality rate, and a doubling in
proportion of female smokers is associated with 0.55 (95% CI: 0.09, 1.02) percent increase in
in COVID-19 case-fatality rate. Open public testing policy is associated with decreased casefatality rate (Beta = 2.23, 95% CI: -4.25, -0.21) percent compared to no testing policy.
Although not statically significant, stringency index showed the smallest coefficient with
COVID-19 case-fatality rate (Beta = -0.02, 95% CI: -0.08, 0.03) among all the investigated
variables (Table 2).

The subgroup analysis by economic level indicates that population size, CVD death rate,
diabetes prevalence, and open public testing policy; population size, population density,
diabetes prevalence, and testing only symptomatic and specified policy and testing anyone

However, the subgroup analysis in upper-middle-income and high-income countries by
testing policy indicates that, if testing was ensured (testing policy =2 or 3), stringency index is
associated with increased case-fatality rate (Beta = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27) (Table 3). The
find suggests an open society policy would be good when testing is ensured. Meanwhile,
diabetes prevalence is inversely associated with case-fatality rate.

Discussion
Geospatial analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic is still full of unknowns, and many of them have a spatial
dimension that lead to understanding the emergency geographically. Analysis of the COVID13

19 data requires an interdisciplinary approach, including spatial statistics that may provide
solutions to address the spatial issues in the pandemic(Meade 2014). A recently published
review summarized studies by May 1, 2020 on geospatial and spatial-statistical analysis of the
COVID-19 pandemic. In total 63 studies were categorized into five subjects: spatiotemporal
analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based
mapping (Franch-Pardoet al. 2020). Although 15 of the studies address the question globally,
none of them investigate the association of COVID-19 related deaths with country level
demographic and/or socioeconomic factors. From a global health perspective, there is
apparent knowledge gap in the research field. Our geospatial analysis fills this gap and help to
understand the consequences of COVID-19 and their related factors from a global level, and
contribute to the predictive modelling and decision-making to combat the pandemic.
Population size and density and COVID-19 CFR
Our results indicate that larger population size is the most consistently associated with higher
COVID-19 CFR, but population density was not associated with the outcome, controlled for
some demographic and socioeconomic variables and spatial dependence worldwide. The
association of population size with CFR can be interpreted at least two ways. It could be
because larger countries experienced greater number of death and conducted relatively less
test compared with countries with smaller population. Alternatively, in larger countries,
healthcare might have been strained and resulted in relatively higher number of deaths among
confirmed cases than smaller countries (World Health Organization 2020a). We are unable to
disentangle the mechanisms of the association. Therefore, it is recommended that the analysis
is replicated by a study with more detailed healthcare information on both individual- and
country-levels. However, in national studies, higher density has been shown to associate with
higher Covid-19 prevalence in Japan (Bassino and Ladmiral 2020), Italy(Sjodinet al. 2020),
and Iran (Ahmadiet al. 2020). The lack of the association of COVID-19 CFR with population

density globally might be due to the confounding by testing strategies and economic levels. In
countries like Germany and South Korea, which took more active testing strategy than, for
example, the United Kingdom (UK) where polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID19 was only performed among those who were with severe symptoms and hospital admitted at
the beginning (Chenget al. 2020a), CFR naturally show lower values. There are weak but
statistically significant negative associations between population size and population density
(r = -0.15, p = 0.042) and GDP per capita (r = -0.20, p = 0.006). In order to minimize the
confounding, we conducted stratified analysis by economic level (Table 2) and testing policy
(only within upper-middle-income and high-income countries, Table 3). The results indicate
that in high-income countries, higher population density was associated with increased
COVID-19 CFR (Table 2). Furthermore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis (Appendix) for
CDR and the results were similar (Table S1 and S2). The results suggests that, globally,
healthcare strain should be firstly relieved and treatment efficiency should be improved in
countries with large populations.
Economic level and COVID-19 CFR
In our analysis, high COVID-19 CFR was found mainly around North America and West
Europe (Figure 1). One of the possible reasons might be that these countries counted COVID19 deaths by including those who died with it, not only from it (Onderet al. 2020; Schellekens
and Sourrouille 2020). Determination of COVID-19 deaths also differed by country. Some
countries recorded a COVID-19 death as any death once the patient became a confirmed case,
even the death happened after 2 months possibly by other reasons (such as an accident), while
in some other countries, a COVID-19 death was recorded as the death occurring within a
certain time period (ranging from 2 to 8 weeks) after COVID-19 symptom onset (Our World
in Data 2020b). Furthermore, the extent that the counting covered home, institutions, and

hospitals in high-income countries is different with that in low-income countries (Schellekens
and Sourrouille 2020).
It has been reported in earlier studies that CFR was more favorable in low-income countries
(Cash and Patel 2020; Schellekens and Sourrouille 2020). There are three possibilities to
explain this unusual pattern: it may be because of younger population, poor data quality, or it
was still the early stage (till we wrote this paper) of COVID-19 infection (Schellekens and
Sourrouille 2020). There is a tight relationship between income level of a country and
demographic structure. For example, many of African countries were classified as lowincome, with median age of 20 years, and 61% of population of them is 24 years or younger,
and merely 3% is equal to or older than 65 years in 2015 (United Nations 2019). It has been
shown that younger age is associated with lower likelihood of severe COVID-19 (Jordanet al.
2020; Liet al. 2020; Team 2020). However, age-related explanation may not be satisfactory
given other factors that are usually associated with higher spread and severity of COVID-19,
lower treatment efficiency, and higher healthcare strain. In terms of absolute count, older
population in low income countries is larger than that in high income countries, and the
prevalence of risk factors such as lack of hygiene facilities, handwashing soap, and water are
greater (Schellekens and Sourrouille 2020). Higher viral load has been suggested to be linked
to more severe disease (Zhenget al. 2020). Healthcare resources are usually low in lowincome countries (Fryattet al. 2010). Even before the pandemic, developing countries
particularly had challenges to collect, verify, and aggregate reliable data in timely manner due
to lack of resource, communication and technological development (Bramet al. 2015). And
the pandemic might have accentuated the pre-existing challenges (Schellekens and
Sourrouille 2020). The extent of bias is difficult to know, including whether it is still in early
stage of infection in developing countries. Therefore, other possibilities, such as data quality

and the stage of infection spread may need to be considered in interpreting the results and
need further investigation in the future.
Proportion of smokers and COVID-19 CFR
The proportion of female smokers was positively associated with COVID-19 CFR in the
overall analysis, but the association diminished when the analysis was stratified by
economical level of the countries/territories. This is counterintuitive given that severer
COVID-19 was associated with male sex due to possibly immune system and hormone levels
(Channappanavaret al. 2017) and smoking (Cai 2020; Vardavas and Nikitara 2020). The
observed association between smoking in females and COVID-19 CFR might be due to that
the proportion of female smoker reflected broadly income level of a country (Figure 6a).
Linking to the theory of diffusion of innovation, the spread of smoking habit has been
illustrated to take several stages of rise, leveling and decline, from rich to poor, men to
women, and young to old (Huismanet al. 2005; Khlatet al. 2016; Pampel 2006). In the early
phrase, the prevalence of smoking increase in men, and women take up smoking about a few
decades later. Subsequently, male smoking start to decline and female follows later on. This
pattern was found to spread from rich to poor countries. In general, Asian and African
countries tended to have low female smoking but high male smoking, while in European
countries prevalence was similar between men and women (Galluset al. 2020; Hitchman and
Fong 2011). Therefore, female smoking in the overall analysis was a marker of the
development of a country and it diminished when the analysis was stratified by it.
Stringency of measures against the COVID-19 epidemic and COVID-19 CFR
According to the currently available data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
Tracker (Haleet al. 2020), South America and Asian took the strictest measures (Table 4 and
Figure 6d), and they also had relatively lower COVID-19 CFR (Table 4). However, in our

multivariable analysis controlled for other variables and spatial dependence, we did not
observe a statistically significant association between stringency index and COVID-19 CRF.
In contrast, stricter measures were even found being associated with higher CFR in uppermiddle-income and high-income countries with active testing policies (Table 3), which seems
supporting the current argument that lockdown measures might result in excess deaths in
underprivileged populations and those in need are hit harder by the crisis (Melnick and
Ioannidis 2020). So far, the evidence that stricter response reduced healthcare strain or
treatment efficiency reflected by COVID-19 CFR globally is lacking. However, the findings
need to be further examined by comparing the all-cause mortalities in previous years.
Meanwhile, the reliability of the stringency index also needs to be further investigated. The
relationship between socioeconomic measures against the pandemic and COVID-19 CFR is a
complicated issue, which needs deeper spatiotemporal analysis with more detailed and
reliable information in the future.

per capita, and (d) stringency index

Noticeably, we also observed negative associations between COVID-19 CFR and CVD death
rate and diabetes prevalence in some analysis, which might be partially explained by the
competing risk between the deaths and/or comorbidities (Berryet al. 2010), because most of
COVID-19 deaths are elderly and have one or more comorbidities (Garnier-Crussardet al.
2020; Richardsonet al. 2020; Yanget al. 2020). Therefore, the COVID-19 CFR worldwide
deserves deeper investigation with more detailed comorbidity information.

Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated relationship between COVID-19
CFR and demographic and socioeconomic factors globally. The study included in total
10,445,656 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 511,030 deaths worldwide. Although numerous
studies have investigated the aforementioned factors related to the COVID-19 CFR, either
they used much smaller sample size and investigated the question locally, or they did not
approach this issue from a geospatial perspective. Our study may inspire new reflections from
the healthcare workers to work together against the COVID-19 pandemic geographically and
globally. International comparison of CFR may be challenging when the ascertainment of
COVID-19 cases differed by country. To tackle this, we performed a sensitivity analysis using

CDR. Although some risk factors, such as CVD and diabetes, showed different pattern of
association, population showed consistent and positive association (see Appendix).
There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, the case-fatality analyzed here was based on
the reported COVID-19 cases and deaths by countries/territories. According to the recent
estimations, asymptomatic carriers and victims of COVID-19 could be as high as 10-80% in a
population (Anastassopoulouet al. 2020; Day 2020; Kimballet al. 2020; Mizumotoet al. 2020;
Nishiuraet al. 2020; World Health Organization 2020b). However, this fraction was not taken
into account in our analysis. Therefore, the case-fatality rates presented in the study might be
significantly higher than the real ones. Secondly, age structure of population influences both
prevalence and mortality of COVID-19, although we adjusted our analysis using the
proportion of age over 60 years in populations, residual confounding largely remains. Thirdly,
no detailed comorbidity information from the COVID-19 cases available in current study,
which might bias the association towards an unknown direction. Finally, during an ongoing
pandemic, delayed reporting occurs for both the number of cases and deaths, and strategies
against the crisis also change time by time. Although we did the analysis two times using the
data obtained on 17 June 17 and on July 2, and produced the same results, which suggests the
bias due to delayed report might be negligible, the dynamic of the problem need to be
addressed incorporating with temporal statistics methods.

Conclusions
The average of country/territory-specific COVID-19 CFR is about 2-3% worldwide, which is
higher than previously reported 0.7-1.3% and possibly due to the unreported asymptomatic
cases. The COVID-19 CFR is statistically significantly associated with population size,
especially in middle-income and high-income countries, which may indicate the healthcare
strain and/or lower treatment efficiency in the countries with large populations. No

statistically significant findings were found in low-income countries, which might be due to
the challenges in data collection, communication, and verification in the countries and need to
be further investigated in follow-up studies. To make global joint strategy and/or policy
against the COVID-19 pandemic, spatial dependence and temporal trends must be consider in
data analysis and decision making.

Materials and methods
Data on COVID-19 by Our World in Data
The COVID-19 dataset used in the study was downloaded from the Our World in Data
website on July 2, 2020, which is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by the
organization Our World in Data and updated daily. The dataset includes country level daily
data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, as well as other variables of potential interest
(Our World in Data 2020a; Roseret al. 2020). The data sources of the dataset including the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), national government reports, the Department of Economic and Social
Affairs of the United Nations (UN), UN Population Division, UN Statistics Division, Oxford
COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, the World Bank, the Global Burden of Disease
Collaborative Network, and Eurostat of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (Our World in Data 2020a). There are in total 34 indices from 209 countries and
territories in the dataset by July 2, 2020. The dataset was linked to the global geospatial vector
database using the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes for the spatial modelling (International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2006).
Case-fatality rate (CFR)
CFR of COVID-19 was calculated as the number of total deaths due to COVID-19 divided by
the number of total confirmed COVID-19 cases by July 2, 2020, multiplied by 100. CFR was

investigated in our study because it may reflect disease severity as well as efficiency of
treatment and healthcare response and strain. CRF is not constant. It can vary between
populations and over time, depending on the interplay between the causative agent of disease,
the host, and the environment as well as available treatments and quality of patient care. For
example, it can increase if the health care system is overwhelmed by the sudden increase of
cases (Harrington 2020).
We also calculated crude cause-specific death rate (CDR) of COVID-19 in a sensitivity
analysis and compared it with CFR. The CDR was calculated as the number of total deaths
due to Covid-19 divided by the production of population and months of the data collected,
multiplied by 1,000,000 (Centers for Disease Control Prevention 2012).
Statistical analysis
The numbers of confirmed cases, tests, and tests per thousand people were not included in the
analysis because they are much depending on the population, detection policy, and quarantine
and isolation policy of the countries and territories. Instead, we included the stringency index
in the analysis, which is a composite measure based on 9 response indicators including school
closures, workplace closures, testing policy, and travel bans etc., rescaled to a value from 0 to
100 (100 = strictest response) (Haleet al. 2020). The stringency index data were obtained from
the World Intellectual Property Organization website on July 1, 2020 (World Intellectual
Property Organization 2020). Because the variable “proportion of the population with basic
handwashing facilities on premises” has missing values in more than 50% of the
countries/territories, it was also excluded from the analysis.
A subcomponent of the stringency index is the government policy on the access to COVID-19
test by 4 groups: 0, no policy; 1, only those who were both symptomatic and met specific
criteria ; 2, anyone symptomatic; 3, and open public testing, such as drive through testing
(Haleet al. 2020). The testing policy indicator was used for stratification of the analysis.

Collinearity and multiple collinearity between the variables were examined using the
Pearson’s correlation coefficient and multiple correlation coefficient, respectively (Mason and
Perreault 1991). Spatial autocorrelation (or spatial dependence) is defined as the relationship
between spatial proximity among some observational units and similarity among their values;
positive spatial autocorrelation refers to situations in which the nearer the observational units,
the more similar their values (and vice versa for its negative counterpart) (Lee 2017). This
feature violates the assumption of independence among observations upon which many
regression analyses are applied. Spatial autocorrelation among the fatality rates of the
countries/territories was examined using a multivariate linear regression model and the
Moran’s I test (Renet al. 2014). The autocorrelation was visualized using the Matern
correlation coefficient (Matérn 2013).
The Matern correlation model, a commonly used model for spatial correlated data, was fitted
for our data to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 case-fatality and the
demographic and socioeconomic variables. The latitude and longitude of the centroid of the
countries/territories were used as random effects in the Matern correlation model (Ward and
Gleditsch 2018).
Variables with skewed distribution were log transformed before entering the regression
models. Multiple imputation method was used to handle the missing values in the data, and 10
imputed datasets were used for the regression analyses (Royston 2004).
Subgroup analysis was conducted by economic levels of the countries/territories according to
the World Bank’s newest classification (World Bank 2020).
The associations of the studied variables with COVID-19 CDR (per 1,000,000 person months)
of the countries/territories for December 31, 2019 to July 1, 2020 were also evaluated using
the same methodology but using Poisson regression model, and the results were presented as
appendix.
