Abstract

Background

4

COVID-19 is characterized by a rapid change in the patient's condition, with major

5

changes occurring over a few days. Our aim was to develop and evaluate an emergency

6

system for monitoring patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where

7

more severe patients stay in their homes.

8

Methodology/Principal findings

9

The system consists of the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient

10

and the hospital unit, which enables the medical staff to telemonitor the patient’s

11

condition and help to send medical recommendations. The home unit allows the data

12

transmission from the patient to the hospital, which is performed using a cell phone

13

application. The hospital unit includes a virtual instrument developed in LabVIEW®

14

environment that is able to provide a real-time monitoring of the oxygen saturation

15

(SpO2), beats per minute (BPM), body temperature (BT) and peak expiratory flow (PEF).

16

Abnormal events may be fast and automatically identified. After the design details are

17

described, the system is validated by a 30-day home monitoring study in 12 controls and

18

12 patients with COVID-19 presenting asymptomatic to mild disease. Patients presented

19

reduced SpO2 (p<0.0001) and increased BPM values (p<0.0001). Three patients (25%)

20

presented PEF values between 50 and 80% of the predicted. Three of the 12 monitored

21

patients presented events of desaturation (SpO2<92%). The experimental results were in

22

close agreement with the involved pathophysiology, providing clear evidences that the

23

proposed system can be a useful tool for the remote monitoring of patients with COVID-

24

19.

25

Conclusions

26

An emergency system for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 was developed

27

in the current study. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early

28

abnormalities in these patients. This system may contribute to conserve hospital resources

29

for those most in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under

30

acute deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.

1. Introduction

35
36

We are experiencing a global pandemic due to COVID-19 of devastating consequences.

37

The highly infectious pathogen that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has infected most

38

of the countries in the world, with over 62.7 million confirmed cases, and just under

39

1.460.000 deaths as of December 1, 2020 [1].

40

As the hospital environment becomes more crowded, the criteria for hospital

41

admission become progressively stricter and, as a consequence, more severe patients stay

42

in their homes awaiting improvement or worsening. It was pointed out previously that a

43

rapid clinical deterioration may occur in the initial phase of COVID-19, due to the

44

development of arterial hypoxemia without a concomitant increase in work of breathing

45

[2]. This can prevent an adequate perception by the patient of the real magnitude of the

46

problem. In this context, patients have emerged who silently and rapidly decompensate

47

respiratory function at home, progressing to death even before receiving specialized care.

48

Thus, it is essential to obtain severity markers, especially to predict and prevent the

49

evolution to hospitalization in ICU and death. In this emergency scenario, a consensus

50

has emerged in the literature on the need to institute home monitoring of these patients

51

[3-5], enabling early identification of those who deteriorate acutely and require urgent

52

assessment.

53

In this context, our aim was to develop an emergency system for monitoring

54

patients with COVID-19, which may be useful in hospitals where more severe patients

55

stay in their homes. We hypothesized that an emergency system based on a smart phone

56

application and specific instruments that allows oxygen saturation, body temperature and

57

peak expiratory flow could be useful as a COVID-19 home-monitoring tool in clinical

58

practice.

2. Proposed emergency home monitoring system

60

Based on previous studies monitoring respiratory diseases [6] and the specific

61

characteristics of COVID-19 [7, 8], the following variables were selected for monitoring:

62
63

2.1. Pulse Oximetry

64

In the particular case of COVID-19, this monitoring is essential because in about 10% of

65

cases, especially in the elderly and people with comorbidities, hypoxemia can develop

66

quickly, implying intensive therapy with mechanical ventilation. It is also recognized that

67

hypoxemia is at the very heart of the most severe cases of COVID-19 [9]. In addition,

68

there is now fairly strong evidence that the mortality risk increased with the oxygen

69

saturation reduction [10], which highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of

70

this parameter.

71
72

2.2. Body temperature

73

It is known that increased body temperature (BT) is a marker of infection, so temperature

74

provides important orientation of health professionals during the COVID 19 disease

75

course [11]. A recent report by the World Health Organization showed that of the

76

approximately 56,000 laboratory confirmed cases studied in China, among the typical

77

signs and symptoms of COVID-19, increased BT is the most common [12]. Thus, BT is

78

widely recognized in the literature as an important measurement in the COVID-19

79

pandemic [11-13], that can be used as an easily obtained prognostic indicator [11, 14].

80
81

2.3. Peak expiratory flow

82

The monitoring of peak expiratory flow (PEF) is widely recommended in international

83

guidelines for the management of asthma. In these patients, the predicted percentage of

4

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.20247650; this version posted December 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this

perpetuity.

84

PEF correlates reasonably well with the predicted percentage for forced expiratory

85

volume in the first second (FEV1) and provides an objective measure of airflow limitation

86

when spirometry is not available [15]. The value of PFE can be measured using portable

87

meters, which are affordable and relatively simple to handle. This method is widely

88

recognized as suitable for monitoring the progression of the disease and its treatment,

89

using the initial values obtained from the patient as a control [16-18]. The monitoring of

90

PEF also helps to monitor the improvement in the patient after a particular mode of

91

treatment [18]. In general, PEF is reduced in all types of respiratory diseases. PEF has

92

also been a valuable measure in differentiating dyspnea secondary to congestive heart

93

failure versus chronic lung disease [39]. Ignacio-garcia et al. observed a significant

94

improvement in morbidity parameters in the 35 patients with asthma monitored through

95

peak flow at home [19].

96

In asthma, the drop in PEF values indicates a decrease in the condition of patients.

97

From the initial measurements of PEF, the fall in its value by up to 20% indicates caution,

98

but there is no danger, as this variation is not unexpected in a 24-hour period. A drop of

99

20 to 50% indicates that the patient is at risk of suffering an exacerbation. If the drop

100

exceeds 50%, patients are at imminent risk of exacerbation. Reduced PEF values in

101

patients with asthma precede the presence of shortness of breath or even the signs of

102

wheezing and snoring detected by the stethoscope. Thus, correct knowledge of PEF

103

predicts the patient's condition and offers valuable time and opportunity to take all

104

necessary measures to prevent adverse effects of the disease. The integration of PEF

105

monitoring would allow the identification of fall limits of the PEF suitable for monitoring

106

the COVID-19, reducing hospitalizations and death. In this sense, previous studies show

107

that the daily monitoring of PEF was a useful tool in the identification of patients with

108

COPD predisposed to worse clinical outcomes [20].

109

Previous studies describing the physiological changes in COVID-19 have shown

110

rapid reductions in lung volumes in the presence of edema [8, 21], which highlights the

111

importance of monitoring the PEF of these patients. However, there is no previous studies

112

concerning the use of PEF in COVID-19.

113
114

2.4. System architecture

115

The general architecture of the system is reported in Figure 1. The system consists mainly

116

of two parts: 1) the home-based patient unit, which is set up around the patient to acquire

117

data and to receive medical recommendations, and 2) the hospital unit, which enables the

118

medical staff to telemonitor the patient’s condition and help to send medical

119

recommendations.

120
121

Insert Figure 1

122
123

Considering the urgency of patient care, the home-based patient unit was

124

developed using readily available commercial instruments. In order to simplify the use of

125

the system by patients, easy-to-use instruments were selected. Thus, patients were

126

assessed using a portable pulse oximeter (finger type, BIC model YK-80A) together with

127

a disposable peak flow meter (Medicate, model 72000M). The used thermometer was the

128

one owned by the patients.

129

The home unit allows the data transmission from the patient to the hospital, which

130

is performed using a cell phone application. The application was developed in Java using

131

the integrated development environment Android Studio (version 3.6.3). It is based on a

132

form that is filled out and sent by the patient. To make clinical use easier for non-technical

134

environment. This interface is shown in Figure 2.

135
136

Insert Figure 2

137
138

After filled out, this form is sent from the application to an online script from

139

Google, the script saves the data in a worksheet according to the patient ID. To this end,

140

the application uses Google Sheets (spreadsheet where data is saved) and Google Scrips

141

(script that integrates the application and Google Spreadsheet). As a result, the application

142

creates an Excel file with one spreadsheet for each patient, which the maximum size is 5

143

million cells.

144

Additionally, the values obtained in these exams are also recorded by the patients

145

in a follow-up paper personal diary. These diaries are provided to patients at the beginning

146

of the monitoring. This redundancy is important in order to maintain the perfect

147

functioning of the system even in case of failures in the Internet or other system

148

component.

149

In the hospital environment, on the other hand, the hardware platform was

150

constituted by an Intel Core i7-8750H, 2.2 GHz computer with 16 GB of RAM, a hard

151

disk of 1 TB and Microsoft Windows 10 operating system. The software was developed

152

in the LABVIEW 2020 environment (National Instruments, Austin, TX). A user-friendly

153

front panel was also developed to be used in the hospital environment. This interface is

154

shown in Figure 3. Its use is described in the flow diagram presented in Figure 4, and the

155

basic LabVIEW program is described in Figure 5.

The application installed on patients' cell phones sends the data obtained over the

164

monitoring periods to the analysis center in the hospital, where they are stored. Initially,

165

the program (Figure 5) reads the data of the first patient and elaborates the graphs of

166

SpO2, BPM, temperature and PEF (Figure 4). This provides a graphical description of

167

these readings against time (Figure 3), allowing the user to detect trends toward normality

168

or abnormal changes in the mentioned parameters by visual analysis.

169

The program allows the user to select the minimum SpO2 value considered

170

appropriate. Previous studies used a minimum normal SpO2 of 92% [22, 23], while others

171

report that these values are between 93% and 94% [10]. The program automatically

172

searches for the minimum SpO2 values presented by this patient and compared with the

173

selected value. In the presence of saturation values smaller than the value selected by the

174

user, a red indicator light starts flashing, simultaneously with an alarm beep.

175

Similar analyses are performed in terms of BPM and temperature. The user can

176

select the maximum BPM value considered appropriate, as well as the maximum

177

temperature considered normal. In this sense, usually values above 100 BPM are

178

indicative of tachycardia [24] and body temperatures above 37 °C are considered

179

abnormal [11, 24]. The system automatically identifies abnormal values presented by this

180

patient and, in the presence of these events, specific red light indicators starts flashing,

181

indicating the nature of the abnormal event, simultaneously with an alarm sound, similar

182

to the indication of abnormal values in SpO2.

183

EPF analyses are performed taking into account the measured absolute values

184

(blue trace in the EPF chart in Figure 9) and the percent of the predicted values [25] for

185

each monitored patient (yellow trace in the EPF chart in Figure 9). We are performing an

186

initial analysis adapting a methodology traditionally used in asthmatic patients [26]. A

187

zone scheme similar to a traffic light system (green-yellow-red zones) was used to

188

evaluate the predicted EPF values (EPFp) obtained by the patient. The green zone is

189

characterized by PEF readings between 100 to 80% of the EPFp, and signals "all clear".

190

The yellow zone includes reading from 80 to 50% of the EPFp, and signals "caution",

191

while the red zone (below 50% of the EPFp) signals "medical alert". The limits used in

192

the cited zones are probably not adequate for COVID-19 patients, and we hope that they

193

can be rapidly adjusted as the experience of using the system accumulates.

194

When the system is started and used for the first time on the day, the cited analyses

195

are performed for all patients under home monitoring (Figure 4). To simplify the visual

196

analysis of the results from nontechnical personnel, the software allows the user to

197

perform this first evaluations with an automatic increment among patients and a constant

198

time window for each patient (2 minutes, for example, Figure 3). The automatic increment

199

process can be interrupted if more intriguing results that require a longer analysis time

200

are observed in a given patient. The patient details, monitoring values, and the cited

201

analysis may be saved for further analysis (Figure 4).

202

After the first scan of patient results, the system automatically updates the results

203

whenever a patient reports new measurements (Figure 4). This is an important feature as

204

it allows the real-time identification of adverse events, and, as a consequence, the

205

clinician may quickly implement the treatment plan. This can be very useful in COVID-

206

19, since this disease is characterized by the presence of rapid deterioration in the patient

207

conditions.

208

The system also allows the analysis of the results of the measurements in the

209

measurements performed in patients in an asynchronous manner, while monitoring is

210

performed. The medical recommendations, obtained from the analysis of the results sent

211

previously, may be sent using e-mail messages. In case of severely abnormal values,

212

emergency cell phone contact may be used. To help this contact, the system also

213

automatically makes available the patient’s phone number. To receive recommendations

214

in this manner could be a significant benefit for the patient, allowing the fast and easy

215

adjustment of medical treatments. The front panel of this program is similar to that used

216

in the online monitoring system. The interested reader may find a detailed description of

217

this front panel in the supplement (Figure S1).

Preliminary study

234

Twenty-four volunteers were selected for the study, including 12 controls and 12

235

diagnosed with COVID-19. The control group was composed of healthy subjects with no

236

history of COVID-19, tobacco use, as well as cardiac or pulmonary disease. Among

237

COVID-19 patients, all presented asymptomatic to mild disease. All patients were older

238

than 18 years of age, and were enrolled if they had positive COVID-19 testing, which

239

was performed using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of an

240

oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab. Hospital evaluations after RT-PCR tests showed

241

that all patients had resting SpO2 ≥ 94% before the home-monitoring period. In the

242

presence of values indicating adverse events during this period, the need for

243

hospitalization was left to the discretion of the physician evaluating the patient,

244

independent of this study. None of the studied patients required noninvasive or invasive

245

ventilation during or after the monitoring period.

246
247

Statistics

248
249

Initially, the sample distribution characteristics were assessed using Shapiro-Wilk’s

250

test. Since data were non-normally distributed, non-parametric analysis (Mann-Whitney

251

test) were performed. Differences with p≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.

252

These analyses were performed using Origin® 8.0 (Microcal Software Inc.,

253

Northampton, Massachusetts, United States). Graphs were elaborated using MedCalc

254

13.1, and the results are present as the median and interquartile range.

Discussion

293

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a detailed description

294

of an emergency remote monitoring system for individuals with COVID-19. The system

295

is able to provide a real-time monitoring of oximetry, BPM, body temperature and peak

296

expiratory flow. The preliminary results obtained in the 30-day validation study showed

297

that patients with COVID-19 presented reduced SpO2 and PEF values, as well as

298

increased BPM values. This was also the first study to investigate the use of PEF in

299

COVID-19. The proposed system allowed us to quickly respond to early abnormalities in

300

patients with COVID-19.

301

During the 30-days period of the initial tests of the proposed system, 720 data-points

302

regarding SpO2 were remotely obtained, resulting in a total of 16 alerts among the 12

303

monitored patients (Figure 6). It was observed that these alerts resulted from an abrupt

304

drop in SpO2 rather than a gradual decline. This is consistent with previous results [23],

305

and is probably associated with the rapid deterioration caused by a surge in

306

proinflammatory molecules in the “cytokine storm” phase of COVID-19 [27].

307

The values of SpO2 were reduced in patients with COVID-19 in comparison with

308

controls (Figure 8A). This finding is consistent with the observation that in the initial

309

phase of COVID-19 there is an increase in V/Q mismatch and thus persistence of

310

pulmonary arterial blood flow to non-ventilated alveoli. The current understanding is that

311

this results from the infection, which leads to a modest local interstitial edema and loss

312

of surfactant. These factors are associated with alveolar collapse and intrapulmonary

313

shunting [2]. The results observed in Figure 6 are in line with that obtained by O’Carroll

314

and collaborators [28] investigating the remote monitoring of SpO2 in individuals with

315

COVID-19.

316

It was pointed out previously that data are lacking for young adults who often

317

present with mild or asymptomatic disease, a part of the population considered to be

318

highly contagious [29]. Figures 7 and 8B contributes to elucidate this question providing

319

evidence that COVID-19 introduces increased values of BPM in comparison with control

320

subjects (Figure 8B). These results are consistent with a previous review showing that

321

COVID-19 is related with a number of cardiovascular complications [30], and the use of

322

increased heart rate as a clinical criteria for hospital admission in COVID-19 pneumonia

323

[31].

324

It is known that the degree of temperature elevation might reflect the severity of

325

inflammation [11]. Previous studies suggest that poor BT control during the COVID 19

326

disease course is a marker of poor prognosis and BT can be used as an easily obtained

327

prognostic indicator [11]. At this point in the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a specific

328

fever pattern associated with this disease has not yet been identified. In fact, there is a

329

paucity of data on temperature management for COVID-19 [14]. The results of the

330

present study (Figures 9A and B) indicate that the proposed system can help to fill this

331

important gap in the literature. Low fever events were observed in 5 of the 12 studied

332

patients (41.7%), which is consistent with the characteristics of asymptomatic to mild

333

disease of the studied COVID-19 group.

334

Figure 9C and D shows that most of the studied patients presented normal PEF

335

values during the monitoring period. Patients who have been infected by the Coronavirus

336

may develop pulmonary edema and atelectasis, which my result in a reduction in lung

337

volume. Thus, it may be speculated that this reduction may introduce a limitation of the

338

expiratory flow influencing the values obtained in peak-flow measurements. This

339

processes would be similar to that observed in restrictive diseases in which the volumes

340

exhaled are reduced [32]. These effects may explain, at least in part, the decrease in PEF

341

presented in three of the studied patients, as well as the transient values below 50% of the

342

predicted values observed in two patients, as described in Figure 9A. It is noteworthy that

343

one of the patients who had EPF <50% also had desaturation <92%.

344

There is general agreement in the literature that, given the severity of the ongoing

345

global pandemic, the ability to remotely monitor patients who do not require

346

hospitalization is essential for optimal utilization of health care resources [23]. To

347

contribute in this direction, this study presents a low-cost open-architecture emergency

348

system for remote monitoring of patients with COVID-19. There are currently no data to

349

guide the use of home pulse oximetry in COVID-19 patients or its validity in identifying

350

disease progression [23]. There is also a paucity of data on temperature management for

351

COVID-19. No previous study has investigated the use of EFP in COVID-19. The system

352

presented in this study may help to quickly accumulate data on SpO2, body temperature

353

and EPF, contributing to the development of the guidelines for these clinical practices.

354

Remote monitoring systems has been increasingly used in respiratory diseases [6,

355

33-36]. An important factor, in the particular case of COVID-19, is that the disease is

356

characterized by a rapid change in the patient's condition, with major changes occurring

357

over a few days. The proposed system may provide an early detection of patient’s

358

conditions deteriorating at home. The use of this technology allowed us to facilitate

359

discharge in patients with mild-to-moderate disease in a safe and appropriate manner.

360

This procedure hold the potential to increase bed availability without compromising safe

361

patient care.

362

We acknowledge the limitations of our study, including unknown methods of

363

temperature measurement. Nevertheless, a clear trend in increased mortality among the

364

patients with poor temperature control highlights the usefulness of this noninvasively and

365

easily obtained parameter for evaluating patients’ prognoses.

366

Secondly, one could argue that the study presents a small sample size, and

367

additional studies, including a more significant number of subjects are necessary. These

368

studies would allowed us to perform a detailed investigation concerning the utilization of

369

home pulse oximetry, body temperature and peak expiratory flow monitoring to identify

370

robust predictors of hospitalization.

371

Finally, the system validation was performed in subjects from a Brazilian

372

population at a single practice site, which affects the study’s generalizability. Therefore,

373

multicenter studies are necessary in the future to expand the generalizability of these

374

findings. The study used broad inclusion criteria and was performed in a typical setting

375

under usual clinical procedures, which enhanced its generalizability.

376
377

Conclusion

378

An emergency system for home monitoring of SpO2, body temperature and PEF in

379

patients with COVID-19 was developed in the current study. This was the first study to

380

propose such a system and to evaluate the use of PEF in COVID-19. Using this system,

381

the acquisition and analysis of the cited signals can be performed remotely through the

382

Internet. The ability of the system to detect abnormal events was initially validated by a

383

30-day monitoring study in normal subjects and patients with COVID-19. In close

384

agreement with previous results and physiological fundamentals, the presence of COVID-

385

19 resulted in reduced values of SpO2, increased BPM, fever events in 41.7% of the

386

patients and decreased PEF in 33% of the studied patients.

387

The proposed system may contribute to conserve hospital resources for those most

388

in need, while simultaneously enabling early recognition of patients under acute

389

deterioration, requiring urgent assessment.

390

Based on these promising results, future work includes a clinical trial in which we

391

will perform a follow up in well-defined groups of patients with COVID-19. This will

392

provide a detailed evaluation of the clinical contribution of the home monitoring approach

393

in improving the patient’s care and outcomes.
