BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel Coronavirus
(termed SARS-CoV-2) has spread to over 140 countries around the world. Currently,
reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for
diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of
pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and
sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the
RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach.

：

METHODS We established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol
to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103
suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents.

RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and
~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection
(LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of
SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4%
by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21%
down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR
were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load
for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in
the hospital for elderly patients.

CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients
diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for
low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under
observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.

Introduction

In late December 2019, a number cases of pneumonia infection were reported in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It was officially named as Coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has since spread to over
120 countries around the world (1, 2). The pathogen causing the outbreak of disease
was identified as a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the family
Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, all of which are enveloped, non-segmented
positive-sense RNA viruses (3, 4). According to the WHO and Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current gold standard for the diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the reverse transcript quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).

However, RT-qPCR is reported to have issues of low positive rates for throat swab
samples (5) and there were 3% of patients who had negative RT-qPCR test results at
initial presentation while chest CT checks indicated typical symptoms of viral
pneumonia(6). In order to identify and hospitalize COVID-19 patients in time, more
sensitive and accurate tests are required.
Digital PCR (dPCR) is a technology which partitions nucleic acid molecules
across a large number of smaller reactions and acquires amplification data of each
partition at end point based on the intensity of fluorescence (7-9). Quantification is
performed by applying Poisson statistics to the proportion of the negative partitions to
account for positive partitions that initially contained more than one target molecule.
dPCR can offer greater precision than qPCR and is far simpler to use for copy number
quantification due the binary nature in which the partitions are counted as positive or
negative. Additionally, dPCR is more tolerant of PCR inhibition compared with qPCR
due to partitioning and because it is an end-point PCR measurement and consequently
less dependent on high PCR efficiency (10, 11).
In this study, we established one step RT-dPCR protocol for detection of ORF1ab
open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) and E gene of
SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we compared RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR on 194 clinical
samples and found RT-dPCR can significantly improve the sensitivity and diagnostic
accuracy of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Materials and Methods

ETHICS STATEMENT
Data collection of cases and close contacts were determined by the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China to be part of a continuing public health
outbreak investigation and were thus considered exempt from institutional review
board approval. The analysis was performed on existing samples collected during
standard diagnostic tests, posing no extra burden to patients.
STUDY DESIGN
103 febrile suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 75 close contacts and 16
supposed convalescents were chosen in this study. Positive, negative and suspect
results were all included in the chosen specimens according to the RT-qPCR test.
CLINICAL SAMPLES
Respiratory samples were obtained during February and March 2020 from patients
hospitalized or close contacts tested by Beijing CDC (BJCDC), Wuhan CDC
(WHCDC) and a government designated clinical test laboratory (Wuhan considerin
laboratory for medical test, KXR). Samples were stored in viral transport medium
(Yocon Biology) at 4 . RNA was extracted from clinical specimens within 24 hours
by using the MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA
extracts containing human coronaviruses (HCoV)-229E and (HCoV)-OC43 and avian
influenza virus RNAs A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 Virus and Influenza B/Victoria Virus

were provided by BJCDC. Extracted RNA was stored at -80 .

ONE STEP REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION DPCR (RT-DPCR)
The primer and probe sequences for detecting N and ORF1ab gene target of the
SARS-CoV-2 published by Chinese CDC were used for this study(12). For detecting
E gene target, primer and probe recommended by world health organization (WHO)
was used(13). The 20

μL reaction

mixture comprises5

μL of Supermix, 2 μL of

reverse transcriptase, 1 μL of 300 mM DTT from One-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit
for Probes (Cat. #1864021, Bio-Rad), 1 μL of mixture of primers and probe and 11 μL
of RNA template. Each reaction mix was converted to droplets using the QX200
Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad,), transferred to a 96-well plate (Cat. #120019285,
Bio-Rad), heat sealed and amplified in a GeneAmp System 9700 thermal cycler

℃ for 10
min (reverse transcription); 95℃ for 5 min; and 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 sec, and 58℃

(Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 45

for 30 sec. The cycled plate was then transferred to the QX200 Droplet Reader
(Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the QuantaSoft droplet reader software (V1.7.4,
Bio-Rad). Reactions containing more than 10,000 droplets were treated as effective
and involved in data analysis.

LIMIT OF BLANK (LOB) AND DETECTION (LOD) OF RT-DPCR
To establish the limit of blank (LoB) (14), 60 blank measurements were obtained

from 3 blank samples on three days. 70 to 76 measurements from 4-5 samples with
low concentration (1 to 3 cp/reaction) were used to determine the limit of detection
(LoD) according to the CLSI guideline of EP17-A(15).

and 5~11 μL of RNA was prepared. Thermal cycling was performed at 50 °C for 15
min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 5 min and then 45 cycles of 95 °C
for 10 s, 55 °C for 45 s in ABI 7500 RT-PCR thermocycler. Data analysis was
performed using software of ABI 7500 RT-PCR thermocycler.

Results

DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE RT-DPCR ASSAY
The linear range was investigated by varying the mean copy number per droplet,
denoted as λ(16). The precision or relative error of RT-dPCR is related to λ because of
RT-dPCR relies on the Poisson statistics to account for droplets with multiple
molecules(17) . The upper limit of the linearity was 7.8 copies/partition tested by N

gene assay. To determine the lower limit of all three assays, serial dilutions of each
RNA transcript were prepared (Supplemental Table 1). The measured targets matched
the anticipated values in each tested interval. A good linearity (0.93<slope<1.02, R2

≥ 0.9997) between the measured RNA target and the prepared value was observed
over the range from approximately 104 to 100 copies/reaction (Fig. 1). Reactions
containing a mean of 60 E, 66 N or 11 ORF1ab copies fulfilled the criterion for an
LoQ with a CV lower than 25%.

ESTABLISHMENT OF LOB AND LOD FOR RT-DPCR ASSAY
Sixty blank measurements obtained from 3 blank samples were analyzed to determine
the LoB. As the distribution of the 60 blank measurements is skewed (Supplemental
Fig. 1), the LoB was estimated nonparametrically as the 95th percentile of the
measurements. The 15 highest blank values for each target are displayed in
Supplemental Table 2. The 95th percentile corresponds to the 57.5 ordered
observation (=60*(0.95/60+0.5))(15). Linear interpolation between the 57th and 58th
observation yields a LoB estimate of 1.6, 1.6, and 0.8 copies/reaction for E, ORF1ab
and N, respectively.
For determining the LoD of ORF1ab gene assay, 76 measurements were
performed on five samples in 3 different runs on three different days to ensure the
total assay variation is reflected. The distribution of the 76 measurement results from
low concentration samples is not Gaussian (Supplemental Fig. 2A) and so that

nonparametric statistics was used according to the guideline of EP17-A. Consequently,
the LoD is determined to be 2 copies/reaction, the lowest level material where the

β-percentile is 5 %.
To determine the LoD of N and E assay, 83 measurements of E assay on 5
samples and 71 measurements of N assay on 4 samples were performed in 4 different
runs. Similar to ORF1ab gene, the distribution of the 71 measurements for N gene and
83 measurements are not Gaussian (Supplemental Fig. 2B and 2C), and so that
nonparametric statistics was used. Consequently, the LoD is determined to be 2
copies/ reaction.

SPECIFICITY TESTING
The Specificity of the assays for ORF1ab and E gene has been tested in a previous
report (13). To further validate the specificity of all assays, Influenza virus and other
human coronavirus were collected. All assays were tested on human clinical nucleic
acid samples at National institute of Metrology, China. All tests returned negative
results (see Supplemental Table 3).

COMPARISON BETWEEN RT-QPCR AND RT-RT-DPCR ON FEBRILE
SUSPECTED PATIENTS
103 pharyngeal swabs were collected from febrile suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients and the relevant information is listed in Table 1. Among the 103 specimens,

81 (P1 to P81) were tested at KXR with the H&R qPCR kit and 7 (P82-88) were
tested at WHCDC by the Daan qPCR kit. Firstly, the criteria claimed by the H&R kit

≤

manufacturer are: Ct value 35 are positive, Ct value >39.2 are negative, and
35<Ct<39.2 are equivocal. The criteria of the Daan qPCR kit are: Ct >40, negative, Ct

≤40, positive, and equivocal if only one gene with Ct ≤ 40 and no amplification for
another gene. According to such criteria, 14 positive, 25 negative and 49 suspected
SARS-CoV-2 infections were determined and this was reported to the clinical doctors.
For RT-dPCR, three targets are tested in parallel and the determination of a
positive result should meet the following criteria: quantification of any one of the
three gene targets is

≥2 copies/ reaction. If no positive droplet was detected in FAM

channel but positive droplets were detected in VIC indicating RNAseP positive for
human reference control(11), the sample can be judged negative. If 0 < result < 2, it
should be attributed to equivocal and need further check. According to such criteria,
44 out of 49 suspects and 17 out of 25 negatives were corrected to be positive by
RT-dPCR and the positive rate significantly increased. No positive droplet was
detected for the 6 negatives and copy numbers were quantified under the established
LoD for 7 suspects infections, due to either no virus sampled or ultra-low viral load in
these specimens.
15 samples (from P89-P103) were tested at BJCDC with BioGerm qPCR kit and
assays recommended by Chinese CDC. Ct values were not available and only
negative or positive information were reported. Single gene target positive was

determined to be SARS-CoV-2 positive based on parallel test with a commercial kit
and Chinese CDC assays. Therefore, these 15 samples were reported positive by
BJCDC. 8 qPCR negatives for ORF1ab were positive tested by RT-dPCR, showing
high sensitivity for ORF1ab by RT-dPCR. Only 3 negatives for ORF1ab which can be
complemented by E gene targets.
Among the 103 specimens, 29 positive, 25 negative and 49 suspected were
reported by RT-qPCR. However, 61 samples including 17 negative and 44 suspected
tested by qPCR were confirmed to be positive by RT-dPCR, thus 90 patients in total
whose SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were positive tested can be diagnosed with
COVID-19. All the 103 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection according to
a follow-up survey. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly
improved from 28.2% to 87.4% for the 103 patients (Fig. 2A and 2B).

COMPARISON ON CLOSE CONTACTS AND CONVALESCENT
75 specimens were collected from contacts and close contacts. 48 specimens from
contacts were reported negative based RT-qPCR test by BJCDC on Feb 6 and were
confirmed by RT-dPCR on Feb 7 in Supplemental Table 4. According to a follow-up
survey, all of them were in good health and isolation was lifted after 14 days.
27 specimens (Table 2 and Fig. 2C and 2D) were detected at WHCDC by
RT-qPCR with a kit from Daan gene on March 2, 4 and 6. According to RT-qPCR
result, 10 positive, one negative and 16 suspect were reported. It is very difficult to

detect the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids due the low viral load at the early stage for the
close contacts. However, 15 out of 16 equivocal and one negative can be determined
positive by RT-dPCR. The suspect rate was significantly decreased from 21% down
to 1% according to the detection of RT-dPCR. Consequently, except 6 patients can
not be tracked, the rest 10 RT-dPCR positive were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2
infected patients based on a follow-up survey.
Furthermore, among the 16 specimens corrected by RT-dPCR, 6 persons
(P14,18-21and P23 in Supplemental Table 5) were directed for secondary testing
following an initial negative test 2 to 10 days prior. Based on RT-qPCR results,
further isolation and observation was still needed to be conducted as the testing result
is suspect or negative and no clinical symptoms were observed for them. However, if
based on RT-dPCR, all the six patients can be diagnosed with COVD-19 infected by
SARS-CoV-2 and treatment could be conducted earlier. This indicates RT-dPCR is
more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the patients under
isolation and observation without clinical symptoms, which is in agreement with the
very recent online report (18).
Additionally, 16 pharyngeal swabs were collected from convalescent patients
(Table 3). 12 positive, 3 suspect and 1 negative were reported by qPCR. However, all
of these 16 patients are diagnosed to be positive by RT-dPCR, indicating that all of
them still need to be observed in hospital. Regardless the sampling time, correlation
between age and the RNA virus copy number was analyzed (Fig.3). Interestingly,

except P15, with increasing age, the copy number of viral load was much higher,
which indicates a longer observation in the hospital is needed. We set up the threshold
of 15, 20 and 25 copies/reaction for ORF1ab, N and E, respectively. The ORF1ab, N
and E gene copy number were higher than their threshold for 100% patients elder than
60 and 75% (6 out 8 patients) elder than 55 (the median).

Discussion

RT-qPCR, as the standard method of diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2, plays an important
role in this outbreak, though a low positive rate has been reported (5). A number of
factors could affect RT-PCR testing results including sample collection and
transportation, RNA extraction and storage, and proper performance of the kit (19).
More recently, more than 145 RT-qPCR kits have been developed by the in vitro
diagnostic manufactures (IVDs) in China (20). Among the RT-qPCR kits, those with
low sensitivity would cause high false negative rate or high equivocal rate. For the
equivocal results it is necessary to conduct a retest and this would improve the
positive rate of RT-qPCR. However, in the clinical practice under the current situation,
it is impossible to do a same day retest due to the daily burden of thousands of
incoming samples. The testing laboratory should initially report a result based on a
single test, while secondary sampling for a later retest does not need to be sent to the
same laboratory. Therefore, availability of a highly sensitive and accurate

confirmatory method is of particular importance for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in
this outbreak.
Currently, besides RT-qPCR, other methods such as next generation sequencing
(NGS) and immunological detection of IgM and IgG could be used as confirmatory
methods for diagnosis of COVID-19 according to the latest guideline of Diagnosis
and Treatment of Pneumonitis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 (trial seventh version)
published by National Health Commission (21). This would decrease the false
negative rate by applying multiple methods. However, diagnostics of nucleic acids is
still considered as the gold standard as this is the most direct way to detect the
presence of the virus. Thus, digital PCR method could be a powerful complement
method because it can significantly improve the sensitivity for the suspect patients.
The overall sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-qPCR in our study were 36%
and 53%, respectively, according to our follow-up survey on the 188 samples(6 out of
194 can not be tracked). The RT-qPCR sensitivity is in agreement with the previous
report for the throat swab samples (5). However, both sensitivity and diagnostic
accuracy of RT-dPCR dramatically increased to 90 % and 93%, respectively.
Furthermore, it is very sensitive for the very low viral load in close contacts and
suitable for monitoring the change of the viral load in the convalescent patients. An
additional advantage of quantification of SARS-CoV-2 copy number by RT-dPCR is
that comparisons can be conducted between different dates and different laboratories
as absolute quantitation of targets by RT-dPCR provides high concordance between

sites, runs and operators (14, 22, 23). However, it is not possible to compare Ct values
on different runs or different machines. Thus, RT-dPCR is an ideal method to for
measuring the change of virus load in the convalescent patients.
This work demonstrates that RT-dPCR significantly improves accuracy and
reduces the false negative rate of diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2, which could be a
powerful complement to the current RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR is more
sensitive and suitable for low virus load specimens from the patients under isolation
and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.

Fig. 1. Validated range of the RT-dPCR assays for E, ORF1ab and N gene.
Evaluation of linearity of samples containing E, ORF1ab and N gene molecules over
the extended λ range (0.0002 <λ< 7.83). Data are shown in mean with standard
deviation for each dilution series (3≤n≤10).
Fig. 2. Diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR and RT-dPCR on 103 febrile
suspected patients and 75 close contacts. 25 samples positive, 29 negative and 49
suspected were reported by RT-qPCR (A). 90 positive, 6 negative and 7 equivocal
were determined by RT-dPCR (B).10 positive, 49 negative and 16 suspected were
reported by RT-qPCR (C). 26 positive, 48 negative and 1 equivocal were determined
by dPCR (D).
Fig. 3. Scatter plot of copies/reaction values of 15 patients detected by RT-dPCR
for ORF1ab (A), N (B) and E (C). The samples are arranged by ages (from younger
to older). The blue curves fitted by lasso regression show the distribution of
copies/reaction values. The shading that underlies the lasso curves denotes the 95%
confidence intervals. The black curve represents the underlying relationship between
copies/reaction values and ages of the convalescent patients, which was fitted by the
methods of liner models. The liner model was labeled on the left-top of picture. The
horizontal line represents the threshold of 15, 20 and 25 copies/reaction for ORF1ab,
N and E, respectively. The ORF1ab, N and E gene copy number were higher than
their threshold for 100% patients elder than 60 and 75% (6 out 8 patients) elder than
55 (the median).
