Decreasing leucocytes and eosinophils and increasing hemoglobin and CRP were significantly
associated with an increased likelihood of being COVID-19 positive tested. Each single
parameter showed either a high sensitivity (leucocytes, eosinophils, CRP, monocytes,
thrombocytes) or specificity (NLR, CK, ALT, lipase), or a sensitivity and specificity around 60%
(Hb, LDH, AST).

ABSTRACT

51
52

Background.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

53

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is current pandemic disease. Acute polymerase-chain-

54

reaction is the gold standard test for this disease, is not available everywhere. Standard blood

55

laboratory parameters may have diagnostic potential.

56

Methods.

57

suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals

58

in Vienna, Austria. Additionally, clinical characteristics and 28-day outcome were obtained from

59

medical records. We compared standard blood laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and

60

outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those

61

parameters to distinguish between groups.

62

Results. Of the 590 study patients including 276 females and 314 males, aged between 20 and

63

100 years, 208 were tested positive by means of PCR. Patients with positive compared to

64

negative PCR-tests had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils,

65

monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with hemoglobin,

66

C-reactive-protein

67

thromboplastin-time (aPTT), creatine-kinase (CK), lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine-

68

aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), and lipase. Our multivariate model

69

correctly classified 83.9% of cases with a sensitivity of 78.4%, specificity of 87.3%, positive

70

predictive value of 79.5%, and negative predictive value of 86.6%. Decreasing leucocytes and

71

eosinophils and increasing hemoglobin and CRP were significantly associated with an increased

72

likelihood of being COVID-19 positive tested.

73

Conclusions. Our findings suggest that especially leucocytes, eosinophils, hemoglobin, and

74

CRP are helpful to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative tested patients and that

75

a certain blood pattern is able to predict PCR-results.

We evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients

INTRODUCTION

77
78

In December 2019, an uncommonly high incidence of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan province,

79

China, caused by a previously unknown pathogen and showing an unusually high mortality rate,

80

which showed to be a novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome â€“

81

Corona Virus 2).[1] It causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which has reached pandemic

82

levels resulting in significant morbidity and mortality affecting all inhabited areas of the world

83

with large numbers of patients. Hence, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a

84

worldwide pandemic in March 2020.

85

Diagnostic steps for this disease currently are epidemiological contact history, clinical

86

impression, chest radiography, standard blood laboratory, and antigen detection by means of

87

real-time fluorescence PCR. PCR is the gold standard test for detection of SARS-CoV-2

88

infection.[2]

89

It soon became apparent that the available test capacities for PCR testing were far from

90

sufficient, and a feverish search for alternative and simpler detection methods began. To date,

91

point-of-care PCR testing is still not available everywhere. Testing that takes a long time can

92

make up for significant additional efforts of organisation of patient cohorts in hospitals.

93

The clinical appearance of the disease is broadly reported.[3] Signs and symptoms may include

94

fever and cough most commonly, dyspnea, rarely diarrhea, anosmia, or ageusia and others, at the

95

beginning or during the course of the disease.[4-6] Various publications indicated that COVID-

96

19 positive patients showed typical laboratory patterns,[7-9] although many of the earlier studies

97

report on relatively small numbers of COVID-19 positive patients.

98

Zhang et al. included 95 cases with COVID-19-positive pneumonia.[7] They found significantly

99

higher numbers of D-Dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin in patients to be

100

admitted to intensive care levels. In a retrospective report of 138 admitted patients, lymphopenia

101

occurred in 70%, a prolonged prothrombin time in 58%, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase

102

(LDH) resulted in 40% of patients.[10] In an Iranian cohort of 70 COVID-19 positive patients,

103

Mardani et al. found significantly higher neutrophil count, CRP, LDH, aspartate

104

aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and urea levels, as well as lowered

105

white blood count and albumin levels.[11] A further retrospective trial of 99 patients showed

106

decreased lymphocyte counts in 35%, decreased albumin in 98%, increased LDH in 75%, an

107

increased interleukin-6 in 52%, and raised CRP in 86% of patients were reported.[3] Li et al.

108

performed a trial with 989 patients, detecting a combination of eosinopenia and elevated CRP

109

yielding a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 78% for COVID-19.[12] In an additional cohort

110

of 458 patients from Guan et al., leukopenia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and an increased CRP

111

were detected.[4] In two trials, an increased NLR was described as an independent risk factor of

112

mortality for COVID-19 patients.[13, 14]

113

Standard blood laboratory data are potentially of both, diagnostic and prognostic value.[15] On

114

one hand, they can contribute to judge the pre-test probability of a COVID-19 diagnosis and

115

thus, support the effective and efficacious organisational management of a patient in an

116

emergency department. On the other hand, it is of potential value, if standard blood laboratory

117

blood results can help to distinguish a potentially life-threatening course of a disease from a less

118

critical status.

119

Therefore, the overall aim of this study was to evaluate standard blood laboratory parameters and

120

clinical characteristics in a large number of COVID-19 suspicious patients, who underwent PCR

121

testing. The specific aim was to determine whether standard blood laboratory parameters are able

122

to identify positive COVID-19 patients from a large COVID-19 suspected cohort.

in Vienna, Austria. Data extraction was exclusively performed by authorised employees of the

129

emergency department at the Klinik Donaustadt, Vienna. The study protocol was approved both

130

by the Ethics Commission of the City of Vienna (EK 20-122-VK) and the Ethics Commission of

131

Sigmund Freud University Vienna (161/2020).

132
133

Data Collection

134

Data were collected from female and male adult patients with suspected COVID-19 who

135

underwent reverse transcriptase PCR testing via a nasopharyngeal swab performed at one of the

136

five hospitals (Klinik Donaustadt, Klinik Floridsdorf, Klinik Hietzing, Klinik Landstrasse, and

137

Klinik Ottakring) between February 27, 2020 and April 27, 2020. Based on PCR results, patients

138

were divided into a COVID-19 positive or negative group. Patients without reported standard

139

blood laboratory reports, medical history, or outcome documentation at day 28 after consultation

140

were not included.

141

As standard blood laboratory testing was performed according to the clinical care needs of the

142

patients, not all parameters were available for all patients. Parameters available from less than 20

143

patients in the positive or negative group were not analysed. Routine blood tests generally

144

included full blood count, blood chemistry, electrolytes, liver function parameters, renal and

145

myocardial function parameters as well as coagulation markers and markers of inflammation.

146

Patientsâ€™ gender (female/male), age at time of PCR testing (years), coexisting diseases and

147

conditions (e.g. chronic diseases of the lung, liver, kidney; coronary artery disease, diabetes, and

148

arterial hypertension); the clinical 28-day outcome including hospital admission and discharge as

149

well as requirement of intensive care and ventilation, and death details were extracted from

150

medical records.

153

Descriptive statistics was used to describe the characteristics of patients. The distribution of the

154

data was determined by visual inspection of the histograms and the Kolmogorov Smirnov tests.

155

Normally distributed data were calculated as mean value with standard deviation (SD), otherwise

156

as median and interquartile range (IQR).

157

Continuous variables were compared between COVID-19 positive and negative patients with

158

independent t-tests (parametric) or Mann-Whitney U-tests (non-parametric). Blood parameters

159

were categorised according to normal reference ranges used in hospitals. However, since CRP

160

ranges higher than normal (cut off: 0.5mg/dL) were detected in almost all patients (COVID-19

161

positive: 99.5% and negative: 98.2%) and thus, useless to discriminate between COVID-19

162

positive and negative patients, coordinates of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the

163

Youden index were used to determine another, sensitivity and specificity balanced, cut off value

164

for CRP in our cohort. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were applied to describe the relationship

165

between proportions of categorical variables. Correlations between the continuous parameters

166

were performed using Kendallâ€™s Tau. Since neutrophils significantly correlated with leucocytes

167

(0.859; p<0.001) and to reduce the number of predictive variables, we used the neutrophils-to-

168

lymphocytes ratio (NLR) instead of neutrophils and lymphocytes. A cut-off for NLR was

169

determined using coordinates of the ROC and the Youden index (sensitivity and specificity

170

balanced). Hemoglobin was used instead of erythrocytes (0.761; p<0.001) and hematocrit (0.874;

171

p<0.001) due to significant correlations. Procalcitonin and D-Dimer were also not included due

172

to the small sample size. For further analysis between COVID-19 positive and negative patients,

173

only significant different and clinical meaningful parameters were considered.

174

Univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression analyses were used to construct

175

prediction models using PCR results (COVID-19 positive/negative) as the dependent variable

176

and significant patientsâ€™ characteristics and blood parameters as predictors (independent

177

variables). Linearity of the continuous variables regarding the logit of the dependent variable

was assessed using Box-Tidwell procedure with Bonferroni correction. None of the continuous

179

variables violated the linearity assumption. None of the parameters showed multicollinearity.

180

Percentage accuracy in classification (PAC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value

181

(PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated to assess modelsâ€™ performance. Area

182

under the ROC curves (AUC) were determined in order to assess the overall discriminatory

183

ability of the model and of blood parameters to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and

184

negative patients. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of <0.05 (two-sided). All data were

185

analysed with SPSS software (IMP Statistics Version 25; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

187

RESULTS

188

Characteristics of COVID-19 Suspected Patients

189

A total of 655 patients from the four hospitals underwent PCR testing between February 27,

190

2020 and April 27, 2020. Forty-five patients were not evaluated due to missing data. Another 17

191

patients who were tested within this time period with complete data sets were excluded since

192

they were hospitalized more than one month before (n=16) or more than seven days after (n=1)

193

PCR-testing. Patients (n=3) with both eosinophilia and acute malignant disease were excluded as

194

well.

195

The median age of the 276 female (46.8%) and 314 male (53.2%) patients was 71 years (range,

196

20-100years; 60.7% of the patients were â‰¥65 years of age at time of PCR testing). No

197

comorbidities were recorded in 69 (33.2%) and 84 (22.0%) COVID-19 positive and negative

198

tested patients, respectively. COVID-19 negative tested patients had significantly more

199

comorbidities than COVID-19 positive tested patients (median (IQR): 1 (1-3) vs. 1 (0-2); p

200

<0.001). The most common comorbidity was pre-existing arterial hypertension (58.1%),

201

followed by diabetes (25.4%), coronary heart disease (19.5%), chronic lung disease (16.9%),

202

chronic kidney disease (15.8%), malignant diseases (13.6%), cerebrovascular accidents (7.5%),

203

chronic liver disease (4.2%), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, 0.5%).

204

A comparison between demographic characteristics and comorbidities between COVID-19

205

positive and negative tested patients showed no significant differences between the groups

206

(Table 1).

207

Similar numbers of outpatients tested positive (11.1%) or negative (8.6%; p=0.338). There was

208

also no significant difference between COVID-19 positive compared to negative tested patients

209

regarding the number of patients requiring ICU and/or ventilation (4.0% vs. 9.3%, respectively;

210

p=0.091). Significantly more COVID-19 positive (25.5%) than negative (9.2%) tested patients

211

died before day 28 (p<0.001). Main causes of death in COVID-19-positive patients were, in

212

descending order, pneumonia (67.3%), followed by multi-organ failure (24.5%), acute cardiac

213

failure (7.6%), and acute renal failure (1.9%).

214
215

Comparison of Standard Blood Laboratory Parameters between Covid-19 Positive and

216

Negative Patients

217

COVID-19 positive patients had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, NLR, basophils,

218

eosinophils, monocytes, and thrombocytes; while significantly higher levels were detected with

219

hemoglobin, CRP, aPTT, CK, LDH, ALT, AST, and lipase compared to COVID-19 negative

220

patients. Similar levels were detected regarding procalcitonin, albumin, glucose, potassium, total

221

bilirubin, GGT, creatinine, and BUN between the groups (Supplement Table 1). Parameters with

222

significant differences are presented in Table 2.

223

After dichotomizing blood laboratory parameters, similar significances were detected (Table 2);

224

while binary comparisons of aPTT (normal+high (â‰¥21sec): 97.9% positive vs. 97.6% negative)

225

and total bilirubin (normal+high (â‰¥0.3mg/dL): 93.6% positive vs. 89.6% negative) showed no

respectively).

228
229

Univariate and Multivariate Analyses of Standard Blood Laboratory Parameters

230

Univariate logistic regression analysis with COVID-19 positive tested patients as the dependent variable

231

revealed that the majority of blood parameters including the dichotomized levels were associated with a

232

positive COVID-19 diagnosis (Table 3). Comorbidities due to their low discrimination ability and

233

parameters without significant associations were not included in further multivariate analyses

234

(Supplement Table 2).

235

The multivariate logistic regression model was statistically significant (Chi-square (14) = 119.2; p<0.001)

236

and explained 62.8% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in COVID-19 positive tested patients and correctly

237

classified 83.9% of cases. Sensitivity was 78.4%, specificity was 87.3%, positive predictive value was

238

79.5%, and negative predictive value was 86.6%. Of the 14 predictors, four were statistically significant

239

including leucocytes, eosinophils, hemoglobin, and CRP (Table 3). Decreasing leucocytes and

240

eosinophils as well as increasing hemoglobin and CRP were associated with an increased likelihood of

241

being COVID-19 positive tested. AUC, as a measure of the overall discriminatory ability of the model,

242

and the modelâ€™s best blood parameters combined are presented as ROC curves in Figure 1.

244

Diagnostic Performance of Single Standard Blood Laboratory Parameters

245

Diagnostic performance of those four dichotomized blood parameters, which were significant at the

246

multivariate logistic regression as well as those, which were significant at the univariate analysis, were

247

evaluated regarding their ability as single parameter to distinguish between COVID-19 positive from

248

negative tested patients (Table 4). Each single parameter showed either a high sensitivity (leucocytes,

249

eosinophils, CRP, monocytes, platelets), a high specificity (NLR, CK, ALT, lipase), or a sensitivity and

250

specificity around 60% (hemoglobin, LDH, AST).

252

DISCUSSION

253

In this trial, we showed that the likelihood of a SARS-CoV-2 infection can be enforced through

254

standard laboratory blood findings to a high degree. Several studies including meta-analyses

255

recently focused on prediction of the severity of the disease derived from blood results.[8, 9, 16]

256

Our consideration to find a model to predict the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with

257

standard blood parameters has been less studied.

258

To our knowledge, only three other trials comparing standard blood parameters between positive

259

and negative cases are published to date.[11, 12, 17] Similar to those studies, our study showed

260

that leucopenia, eosinopenia, elevated hemoglobin, and CRP were detected to be among the best

261

standard laboratory parameters to distinguish between COVID-19 positive from negative tested

262

patients. Accordingly, similar patterns have been detected in positive COVID-19 patients with a

263

severe compared to a mild form of the disease.[8, 9, 16] The major differences of the three

264

studies, which compared COVID-19 positive and negative patients, opposed to the reviews,

265

which reported only on positive tested patients, were documented regarding leucocytes,

266

neutrophils, and hemoglobin (Table 5).

267

In conformity with other publications [11, 12, 17], leucocytes were lower in COVID-19 positive

268

than negative patients at the time of PCR testing, and so were neutrophils and lymphocytes;

269

while severe compared to mild forms of COVID-19 tend to have higher leucocytes and

270

neutrophils. As opposed to our findings, which showed a low ability of NLR to discriminate

271

between positive and negative (AUC=0.561) and basically no contribution in the multivariate

272

analysis, a raised NLR, which evolved from a raised neutrophil count as well as a lowered

273

lymphocyte count, was already shown previously to be a prognostic value for endotracheal

274

intubation and mortality predictor.[13, 14] A cut-off of 4.94 was used in the publication by

275

Tatum et al. [14]; above this value, the risk of being artificially ventilated or to die was

276

increased. Notably, 89% of those patients were African Americans. A lower cut-off (2.33) was

277

established in our study, which might be because only 15% of patients had a neutrophil count

278

higher than 7.7x109/L. We are however unaware of any study using NLR as a pure discriminator

279

between positive and negative COVID-19 diagnosis.

280

However, severity of illness appears to be less important regarding the other parameters,

281

especially regarding eosinophils and CRP (Table 5). Like in other publications [12, 17], our data

282

also showed that eosinopenia was one of the significant predictive biomarkers for COVID-19

283

with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 50%.

284

Li et al. [12] and our study showed an increased hemoglobin in COVID-19 positive patients,

285

which is not in accordance with a lowered hemoglobin in patients with severe COVID-19

286

disease reported by two meta-analyses.[8, 16] In our data, the median hemoglobin was 13.5

287

g/dL, which did not much differ from Liâ€™s data.[12] In several other trials assessing the severity

288

of disease and blood patterns, hemoglobin was shown to be below normal ranges.[8, 9, 16] It can

289

only be hypothesized why our cohort presented with a comparably high level of hemoglobin.

290

Possibly, a degree of dehydration played a role at the time of presentation in the emergency

291

department. Indeed, an average temperature of 38.0Â±0.9Â°C on presentation in 99 COVID-19

292

positive and 37.1Â±1.4Â°C in 103 COVID-19 negative patients, which was a significant difference,

293

was detected in a subgroup analysis of 202 of our patients.

294

Not surprisingly, CRP was significantly elevated in all studies.[11, 12, 17] In our patients, we set

295

a new cut-off using the Youden index of 22 mg/dL, since the vast majority of patients had

296

increased CRP values.

297

Similar blood patterns were also detected regarding ALT, AST, and LDH.[8, 9, 12, 16, 17]

298

Brinati et al. included 279 patients and developed a score for SARS-Cov-2 detection with an

299

accuracy between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% and 95%.[18] Applying our data

300

including age, gender, leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils,

301

thrombocytes, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, and LDH to Brinatiâ€™s tool, a quite high AUC

302

(AUC=0.709, 95%CI 0.646-0.771; p<0.001), sensitivity (70.4%), specificity (71.3%), and NPV

303

(79.9%), but less promising PPV (59.8 %) could be obtained. However, our model including 14

304

standard laboratory blood parameters reached better diagnostic performances in all areas

305

(AUC=0.915, 95%CI 0.876-0.955); sensitivity (78.4%); specificity (87.3%), PPV (79.5%), and

306

NNP (86.6%)), although, the most prominent parameters were leucocytes, eosinophils,

307

hemoglobin, and CRP.

308

The following limitations of the study should be noted. The retrospective design with missing

309

blood parameters and no validation cohort are amongst the major limiting factors and thus, our

310

selected model may be over-fitted. Additionally, with the single time point evaluation, we were

311

not able to retrieve information regarding progression of the disease. Furthermore, cytokines,

312

especially interleukin-6, were not routinely measured, which may be better predictors, especially

313

regarding the so-called â€šCOVID-19 cytokine stormâ€˜, to elucidate COVID-19 positive from

314

negative patients. Another fact to consider is the heterogeneity of underlying diseases, which

315

may also contribute to variations in our findings. On the other hand, such a heterogeneity may

316

reflect reality during a pandemic situation best. Eventually, all test quality crucially depends on

317

the quality of the manual specimen acquisition.[19, 20] PCR results tend to be more positive in

318

patients with an increased viral load and with a shorter duration of the disease.[21]

319

Conclusions

320

Generally, as laboratory equipment supply develops, more PCR point-of-care diagnostics

321

become available. It is nonetheless doubtful that - neither in the near, nor in the far future â€“ PCR

322

will entirely replace standard laboratory testing. Therefore, the question of a blood laboratory

323

pattern, as specific as possible for COVID-19, remains relevant. Our multivariate model

324

including 14 standard blood parameters correctly classified 84% of cases with a sensitivity of

325

78% and a specificity of 87%, and therefore could be a useful model to facilitate rapid triage of

326

potential COVID-19 patients.
