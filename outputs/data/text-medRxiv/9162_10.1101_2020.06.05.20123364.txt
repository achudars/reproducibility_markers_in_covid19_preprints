Abstract

12

On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared SARS-CoV-2

13

pandemic; and at present there are over 6 million cases across the globe. Based on the interim

14

guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the

15

only way to control the pandemic. This led to ‘Manufacturing’ shut down, which acted as a

16

spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to

17

review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18

18

countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case

19

recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of

20

92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting

21

crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A

22

sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12

23

countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first

24

intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant

25

improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation

26

of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time

27

point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation

28

as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on

29

cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown.

Introduction

32

World economy is a network of the global value chain, where every single country is a

33

partner. By March 2020, the whole civilization realized the pandemic impact of SARS CoV2;

34

and world over, the restrictions in movement and lockdown have severely impacted the

35

industrial supply chain.1,2 The cumulative effect of this interrupted productivity led to loss of

36

millions of jobs and this has now created uneasiness at the different levels of society; and

37

hence, governments are looking for solutions to come out of this lockdown situation.3–5

38

Different modelling approaches have been reported to predict the course of the viral spread,

39

of which susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model, is the most explored

40

approach applied by various groups with data collected from different countries.6,7 However,

41

due to the unpredictable propensity of this virus and the sporadic identifications of surge

42

clusters in the society, there were interim directives made by different governments. Inclusion

43

of such inputs limits the prediction accuracy of model for the course of a pandemic.

44

Another issue is the diversity as reflected by genome sequence data that suggests, virus is

45

either mutating or adapting according to host in different part of the world.11.

46

In this paper, we have opted an observational approach using the data for monitoring test with

47

active, recovered and fatal cases and whenever the model showed some perturbations, we

48

have tried to link with the government interventions, which could have influenced the spread

49

of the virus through usual or community transmission mode.

50

Method

51

In this study, an observational approach was adopted in which epidemiological parameters

52

were observed with time and retrospectively analysed with reference to interventions or

53

public announcements by the governments.

54

Eighteen countries mostly from Europe and Asia were considered with at least 1000

55

diagnosed cases as on March 31 st 2020. All these countries were tracked from March 1 st for

56

the number of new cases, active cases, recoveries and number of fatalities. The data source

57

was John Hopkins CSSEDISandData, available as an open source. This data was used to

58

derive the case active rate (CAR), recovery rate (CRR) and the fatality rate (CFR) at each

59

discrete time point till May 31, 2020. These rates were obtained as the cumulative number of

60

active/recovered/fatalities on a specific day to the total number of cases diagnosed till that

61

day, considering a lag of zero days. Thus, on any day, the total infected individuals were

62

categorized into these three states, summing to unity. Moreover, the ratio of number of newly

8–10

63

detected cases to the total number of tests performed was also obtained giving the positive

64

confirmation rate (PCR) of the disease with time. The data source for the number of tests was

65

ourworldindata.org.12 All these rates were plotted in the same frame with a time window

66

spanning 92 days i.e. from March 01, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The interventions in the form of

67

national recommendation, lockdowns in each of these countries during this period were

68

linked with the progression of CAR, CRR, CFR and PCR. The foremost interest was to

69

observe the crossover time point of active and recovery rates for each country. This is the

70

time point at which the CRR is either greater than or equal to CAR. Also, the time point for

71

peak PCR i.e. the time at which the PCR attains maximum, was observed for each country.

72

For countries in which the crossover point has not reached, time-series non-linear models

73

could be used for prediction. A sample study was performed for India in which piece-wise

74

linear regression and quadratic regression models were fitted to predict the crossover point at

75

the end of 60th and 75th day in the lockdown period. The residuals were obtained to decide

76

how well the models capture the trend.

77

Further, a hierarchical strategy of disease management has been proposed for multistate

78

countries, with each state comprises of cities/districts. Two outcome criteria i.e. CRR and

79

CFR can be referred to indicate the COVID19 status of each city/district within the state. The

80

CRR at the crossover time point and the corresponding CFR at the same time point can be

81

used to determine the hot-spot cities/districts within the state. A sample study was performed

82

for India, in which the most affected states were mapped based on the above rates. Further, a

83

sample exercise was performed for Maharashtra state, wherein the cities/districts were

84

mapped using the above rates. Thus, the city/district level information is available for state

85

government, while state level information is available to central government for necessary

86

interventions.

87

Results

88

Among the selected countries, seven were from Asia, while eleven were from European

89

continent including Russia, which is transcontinental. The CAR, CRR and CFR for each day

90

along with the PCR were obtained for each country. Simultaneously, the major events and

91

interventions relevant to the disease dynamics were studied for each country. The trends for

92

twelve countries attaining the crossover are shown in Figure 1 along with the government

93

interventions.

94

In Austria, the PCR increased exponentially till the end of March. By this time, the CAR and

95

CRR were almost constant and the CFR was negligible (< 1%). The effect of intervention

96

surfaced by the end of March, where the PCR reached a saturation level and subsequently

97

started declining. The CAR and CRR deflected by March end and showed a crossover on

98

April 12th with CRR (0.5010) exceeding CAR (0.4739). The CFR was 2.4% at the crossover.

99

Post-crossover, the situation in the country started improving with 93.2% recovery and 3.99%

100

active cases as on May 31th. The time of peak PCR occurred nearly 12 days before the

101

crossover point in Austria.

102

In Germany, the PCR increased across country till March end, while the CAR, CRR and CFR

103

were constant. After 22nd, the CRR gradually headed upwards, and by April 13th, the country

104

attained the crossover with CRR (0.4943) marginally exceeding CAR (0.4811). Moreover,

105

the PCR attained the peak by the same time, which subsequently showed a decline. Post-

106

crossover, the government adopted strategies for stepwise modifying the measures against

107

pandemic. The country has 90.1% recovery and 5.19% active cases as on May 31 st.

108

In Italy, the PCR was steep from March 1 st to March 25rd, and later showed a consistent

109

decline. The crossover was achieved on May 6th with CRR (0.4348) marginally above CAR

110

(0.4268). The peak PCR reached by 21st March and occurred nearly 45 days before the

111

crossover. Post-crossover, the CRR is continually increasing with government restrictions

112

with 67.6% recovery and 18% active cases as on May 31st.

113

In Spain, the CAR and CRR showed a gradual change with high fluctuations till March 21 st.

114

Although the PCR was increasing, the CRR showed upward trend with time. The crossover

115

was achieved on April 24th with CAR (0.455) exceeding the CAR (0.4341). The time of peak

116

PCR almost coincided with the crossover. By 31st May, the country had 62.8% recovery and

117

25.8% active cases.

118

In Switzerland, the PCR increased up to April 5th, while CAR, CRR and CFR were almost

119

constant till March 25th. A crossover was reached on April 12th with CRR (0.4997) exceeding

120

the CAR (0.4568). The PCR started declining after April 12th. The crossover and the time

121

point of peak PCR coincided for Switzerland. Post-cross over, the CRR increased

122

consistently and reached to 92.3%, while active cases were only 1.4% by May 31 st.

123

In Turkey, the spreading peak of virus was noted on April 12th, and subsequently, a gradual

124

slowdown was observed till May 15 th. The CAR started declining after April 23rd and the

125

crossover reached on May 3rd with CRR (0.5010) exceeding CAR (0.4720), and CFR around

126

2.7% continuing till the end of observation period. The time of peak PCR occurred 21 days

127

before the crossover point in Turkey. By 31st May, the recovery was 78.1%, while active

128

cases were 19.2%.

129

Among Asian countries, in Iran, the CAR and CRR showed fluctuations with gradual decline

130

from March 1st to 25th. On April 9th, a crossover was observed with CRR (0.4879) exceeding

131

the CAR (0.45). The CRR increased logarithmically till May 1 st and remained constant even

132

after relaxation. The positive confirmation data available from March 5th showed an

133

exponential decline till May 15 th. As on 31st May, the country has 78.5% recovery and

134

16.4% active cases.

135

In Japan, till March 25th, there was almost a constant PCR of around 5%, with the decrease in

136

CAR and corresponding increase in the CRR with CFR near to 3.4%. The PCR and CAR

137

were at peak on April 19th, which later showed gradual declines. The crossover reached on

138

May 10th with CRR (0.5151) exceeding CAR (0.4453). After May 10th, the CRR continued to

139

increase, while the CFR gradually increased to 4.4% by the end of the observation period. At

140

the end of observation period, the country had 85.6% recovery, while 9.02% active case.

141

In Malaysia, the spread of virus increased sharply from March 1st till 23rd. The CAR also

142

showed increase till this time point with a corresponding decrease in the CRR. The crossover

143

reached on April 14th with the CRR (0.4969) exceeding CAR (0.4867). Post-crossover, the

144

CRR continued increasing till the end of observation period. The time of peak PCR reached

145

21 days before the crossover. The recovery was 81.2% and active cases were 17.3% by May

146

31st.

147

In South Korea, the spread of virus reached a peak on March 3rd and thereafter showed a

148

gradual decline by the end of May. The CAR and CRR were almost constant till March 10th;

149

however, subsequently, there was a sharp change in these rates resulting into a crossover by

150

March 28th with the CRR (0.5076) exceeding CAR (0.4772). Post-crossover, the trends

151

continued along with reducing spread as on May 31st. The time of peak PCR reached 25 days

152

before the crossover point.

153

In Singapore, the CAR increased till April 22 nd, and then was constant till May 9th. Later it

154

started declining and by May 27 th provided the crossover. Subsequent to this, the CAR

155

continued declining with increasing CRR. The peak PCR was observed by May 4 th and was

156

constant till the end of May. The recovery was 62.2%, which active cases were 37.8% by the

157

end of observation period.

158

In Saudi Arabia, the CAR and CRR were almost constant till March end. There was a

159

deflection in the trend, which continued till April 10th. Again, there was almost a constant

160

phase for both the rates till May 3rd. Later, there was consistent decline in CAR and increase

161

in CRR with a crossover on May 20 th. Post-cross over the trends continued with a recovery of

162

73.2% and active rate of 26.2% as on May 31 st.

163

For other countries like France, India, Russia, Sweden and United Kingdom, the crossover

164

could not be observed till the end of May, despite different measures by the local

165

governments (Figure 2). The crossover point could be predicted for such countries using

166

appropriate linear/non-linear models. The analysis for India have been presented.

167

Cross-over forecasting – A study for India

168

In India, since March, the incidence of COVID19 is on its rise. Figure 3 provides the CAR,

169

CRR and CFR, which shows that the crossover point is very close but not reached in the

170

observation window. The PCR increased till April 6th and later continued in the range of 4 –

171

4.71% till May 15th. However, subsequently, the rate is increasing exponentially and has

172

touched 5.1% by May 31 st. Since April 10th, the CRR started increasing; nevertheless, the

173

crossover is still awaited. The fatality rate is around 3% since April 1st.

174

A predictive modelling to estimate the crossover time point was carried out using Piecewise

175

linear and quadratic models (Figure 4A-B), which shows graphical visualization of model fits

176

along with predictions for piecewise model with 80% and 95% confidence bands. The

177

predictions were done after 60 days and 75 days with March 1st as zeroth day. For piecewise

178

model, a single knot at c=40 days was considered for fitting purpose. Based on 60 days

179

(Figure 4A), the quadratic model predicted the crossover on 72nd day, while the piecewise

180

model predicted on 84th day. The analysis based on 75 days provided crossover on 90th day

181

by quadratic model, while 91st day using piecewise model. Thus, it is evident that the

182

piecewise regression model was relatively more consistent in predicting the crossover

183

irrespective of the training set. From April 10th, the two rates are following almost a linear

184

trend. The predictions by quadratic model deviated drastically with 60 days data sets, while

185

overlapped considerably with piecewise model for 75 days data set. The heteroscedasticity in

186

the rates was less after 40 days as evident from the figure, resulting in minimal residual error

187

for piecewise regression model. So, with continuing restrictions, the crossover was expected

188

by 91 days i.e. end of May for India; however, could not be achieved when observed with

189

actual data. Tentatively, now expected in first week of June.

190

Since, it was observed that once a country crosses 50% cumulative recovery cases, the trend

191

is always followed. Hence, we first predicted the possible time point for 50% cumulative

192

recovery of cases for India; as described earlier. The next step was how to derive a criterion,

193

which can propose the strategy to gradually exit the lockdown with national data supporting

194

0.5 CRR. We have applied following disease management strategy, we propose two

195

parameters viz., CFR and CRR that can be jointly assessed for each state and eventually each

196

city/district. The thresholds for these parameters can be referred based on overall national

197

data for CRR and CFR; and accordingly, the classification can be obtained at each

198

hierarchical level. Figure 5A provides the country level representation in which different

199

states (majorly affected) have been positioned as per the CFR and CRR status on May 31 st.

200

The states in each quadrant can be further assessed at next hierarchical level i.e.

201

cities/districts. Figure 5B gives the state level representation for Maharashtra. The hot-spots

202

within the states and their movements with time can be observed and accordingly the action

203

plan at city level can be determined. Figure 5C provides the plans for the four zones, which

204

are subject to alterations.

205

Since, the disease progression is dynamic, it is essential to track the movement of each city

206

and thereby the state on a daily basis. A dashboard has been prepared, which at present

207

provides the updates for the most vulnerable state i.e. Maharashtra, which has ~34% of the

208

active cases of the country. We are expanding this platform for the critical states of the

209

country, so that the day wise state level information is available for all critical states. The

210

dashboard can be viewed at: https://covid19stat.shinyapps.io/covid19status/.

211

Discussion

212

The issue with coming out of lockdown or relaxing scenario in between different periods of

213

lockdown is an unexpected surge of transmission waves. 13–15 It challenges the medical

214

infrastructure with overburdened staff and stressed supplies; and this seems to be true for

215

almost every country.16–18 The volatility analysis of wold economy suggests there will be a

216

deep depression around the world in the year 2020; 3,19,20 and WHO recently stated the virus

217

will be around for a while. In such scenario, every country has to delineate the strategic time

218

lines to exit lockdown, since it is crucial to balance the health and economic burdens.21–23

219

In this study, we adopted a strategy of learning from the experiences of select countries based

220

on epidemiological parameters. The primary focus was on crossover time and the time of

221

peak PCR.

The government interventions were linked with these two parameters. The

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123364; this version posted June 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

222

analysis of twelve countries revealed that the two time parameters have association with the

223

governmental decisions, as evident from Figure 1; and that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be

224

effectively modulated. In countries where initial lockdown measures were strictly

225

implemented, like home quarantine, ban on public gatherings, conditional movement only for

226

essential services, and closing of education system, the PCR could be controlled and the

227

crossover could be achieved. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 countries was 37

228

days, while median peak PCR time was 30 days after their first intervention. In six out of the

229

twelve countries, the crossover time occurred after time of peak PCR with a median of 21

230

days; while in three countries i.e. Germany, Spain and Switzerland, the times for two

231

parameters coincided. Further, post-crossover, it was observed that in these countries, with

232

step-wise relaxation of lockdown, the CFR and CRR continued in the acquired directions

233

indicating better pandemic control. The countries like Belgium, France, India, Russia and

234

United Kingdom (UK) are awaiting the crossover point or the peak PCR. In Belgium, France

235

and UK, the crossover is much awaited considering the CAR, CRR and CFR trends. The

236

patients are under prolonged treatment and thus confining the recovery rate. Perhaps age

237

could be one of the factors, as the population median age of these countries is above 40 years.

238

In India and Russia, the crossovers are nearby. It would be interesting to observe the

239

progression of two rates in these countries; and especially for India, which is stepping in the

240

unlock phase I. During the lockdown period, the country has seen improvement in the CRR

241

with controlled CFR; however, could not reach the crossover. Based on the experiences of

242

other countries regarding lockdown and relaxations, it is anticipated that the two rates should

243

continue with the acquired trends, and that the current CFR remains steady and PCR shows

244

deceleration. To achieve this, the unlocking phase needs a careful monitoring of cities and in

245

turn the states. The hot-spots will depend on the current national CFR and CRR rates, which

246

are dynamic with time. The proposed real time dashboard could be of immense utility at these

247

moments.

248

Another interesting observation comes from the genome sequence data of virus, with over

249

32000 genome sequence available globally (https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-

250

hcov-19-app/). The data suggests that there are seven major clades which can group most of

251

the sequences with every clade having significant variation at the individual sequence level.

252

There is significant variation in sequences after mid-February. The viral sequences can be

253

grouped in two different clades which are associated with European sequence data. Whereas,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123364; this version posted June 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

254

Asian sequences are close to two major European clades, with an additional clade having

255

different sequences representing different countries.

256

There is a need to understand the whether the strains/sequence data observed in the twelve

257

countries have any association with the peak PCR and the crossover times observed in these

258

countries. This may reveal the relevance of different strains and its interaction with host

259

machinery, which is supporting the viral multiplication and its dispersion factor. 24 The viral

260

genome sequence data analysis from India shows two major clades. 25,26 However, the

261

sequence data is not having enough representative sequences from the country, and hence

262

cannot be correlated with number of active cases observed in different states for the moment.

263

For some countries, the crossover point is before 50 days, while for others it is beyond. It will

264

be interesting to map the sequence data from different countries before and after the cross

265

over time, where 50% recovery rate has been achieved. This can further be analysed with

266

countries showing delayed or no crossover point. This pattern of dispersion of infection needs

267

further analysis with its correlation with demographic or even with data from the virus-host

268

interaction studies.27 Irrespective of genetic property of virus and its multiplication in host,

269

it’s evident from the analysis of different countries that the regulation imposed as lockdown

270

and restriction in activities has real role in controlling of this pandemic. The other important

271

observation emerged that once a country crosses 50% cumulative case recovery, then it

272

always follows the improvement trend, even though in cases of few countries, there were

273

surges of positive cases around the cross over point was observed.

274

Conclusion

275

The exit from lockdown is the only imperative option for any economy to come back to its

276

normalcy, and that means the restoration of supply chain so that every component of society

277

gradually recovers from scarcity of resources. The parameters used in this study, like crude

active rate, recovery rate and positive confirmation rate are the ‘real indicators’, which are

279

inclusive of many factors like population location, susceptibility, incidences, and surveillance

280

for respiratory infections, which may independently and severely impact the forecasting. By

281

referring to the criteria of crossover and peak time point of positive confirmation rate, policy

282

makers can assess the impact of the decisions being taken up. This proposal advocates

283

relaxing norms for state or district where these criteria are fulfilled but puts the condition of

284

isolating the areas, which are still struggling with unfilled threshold parameters.

The epidemiological measures for Asian (A) and European (B) countries achieving crossover time
point within the observation window of 92 days starting from March 01 – May 31, 2020. Alongside is
the description of various events and interventions by the respective governments before and after
crossover time. It seems that in eight of these twelve countries, the decision for relaxation of
lockdown has been taken after reaching the crossover time and deceleration of PCR. A prior peak for
PCR followed by a crossover could be a controlled scenario for any country to manage COVID19
pandemic. Subsequent to crossover, the CAR and CRR were found progressing in the same acquired
directions in logarithmic manner. Based on these trends, the strategies by these governments appears
to be rational, and can be adopted by countries in which the crossover is still awaited.
