Patient prioritisation methods to shorten waiting times for elective
surgery: a systematic review of how to improve access to surgery
ABSTRACT
Background: Concern about long waiting times for elective surgeries is not a recent
phenomenon, but it has been heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
associated measures. One way to alleviate the problem might be to use prioritisation methods
for patients on the waiting list and a wide range of research is available on such methods.
However, significant variations and inconsistencies have been reported in prioritisation
protocols from various specialties, institutions, and health systems. To bridge the evidence gap
in existing literature, this comprehensive systematic review will synthesise global evidence on
policy strategies with a unique insight to patient prioritisation methods to reduce waiting times
for elective surgeries. This will provide evidence that might help with the tremendous burden
of surgical disease that is now apparent in many countries because of operations that were
delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and inform policy for sustainable
healthcare management systems.
Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Library, with our most recent searches in January 2020. Articles published after 2013 on major
elective surgery lists of adult patients were eligible, but cancer and cancer-related surgeries
were excluded. Both randomised and non-randomised studies were eligible and the quality of
studies was assessed with ROBINS-I and CASP tools. We registered the review in PROSPERO
(CRD42019158455) and reported it in accordance with the PRISMA statement.
Results: The electronic search in five bibliographic databases yielded 7543 records (PubMed,
EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane) and 17 eligible articles were identified

in the screening. There were four quasi-experimental studies, 11 observational studies and two
systematic reviews. These demonstrated moderate to low risk of bias in their research methods.
Three studies tested generic approaches using common prioritisation systems for all elective
surgeries in common. The other studies assessed specific prioritisation approaches for reordering the waiting list for a particular surgical specialty.
Conclusions: Explicit prioritisation tools with a standardised scoring system based on clear
evidence-based criteria are likely to reduce waiting times and improve equitable access to
health care. Multiple attributes need to be considered in defining a fair prioritisation system to
overcome limitations with local variations and discriminations. Collating evidence from a
diverse body of research provides a single framework to improve the quality and efficiency of
elective surgical care provision in a variety of health settings. Universal prioritisation tools
with vertical and horizontal equity would help with re-ordering patients on waiting lists for
elective surgery and reduce waiting times.
Key words: Patient prioritisation, elective surgery, waiting time, systematic review

INTRODUCTION
Concern about long waiting times for elective surgeries is not a recent phenomenon, but it has
been heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated measures.
Waiting times are a key performance indicator for many healthcare systems and waiting-time
targets are used to encourage improved performance in healthcare institutions to deliver highquality care without unnecessary delay (1). The COVID-19 pandemic has already added
considerably to this challenge, leading to a considerable increase in the pressure on healthcare
institutions to clear patients in clinics. The healthcare system slowdown caused by the
pandemic and its associated measures has had a substantial impact on elective services (2) and
efficient allocation of elective surgical resources are more critical than ever in the business as
unusual (BAUU) future for healthcare systems and institutions (3). There is also a need for
strategies implemented during the pandemic to be continually integrated into hospital practices,
to minimise the risk of transmission of the coronavirus (4).
Waiting lists are considered as a non-price rationing mechanism for coping with excess
demand. Long waiting times are associated with many adverse effects, including a higher risk
of death and serious complications for patients, especially adults (5-10). Consequently, waiting
times for elective surgeries are a major policy concern in many countries, especially for health
systems operated with public funds (11). Despite increased funding in recent years, the demand
for many elective surgeries exerts a substantial challenge, which was growing even before the
COVID-19 pandemic (12). The negative impact of patient waiting time on cost-effectiveness
in economic evaluations has also found to be non-reversible (13-15) and there is a need for
economic evaluations, adapted to outbreak situations (16), to estimate the specific impact of
COVID-19 pandemic on the pre-existing crisis of longer waiting times.

A large amount of literature is available on a large array of methods to reduce patient waiting
times for elective surgeries. The research focus has shifted recently to individual strategies,
rather than system-wide approaches. One of these strategies is to prioritise patients, such that
the waiting list is re-ordered. Although prioritisation does not always reduce total waiting time
for all patients, it allows those patients in the greatest need to be treated first.
Prioritisation processes are used in many countries to order the queue of patients for highdemand surgeries, and many research studies have demonstrated promising results for various
patient prioritisation methods, but there are few systematic reviews of the effects of these
methods. As an example, a systematic review done in 2003 on patient prioritisation for elective
surgery sought to determine the basis of ethical approaches used in different prioritisation tools
(17), and other systematic reviews have analysed different approaches to reduce waiting times
for elective surgery (18-20). To bridge the evidence gap in the current literature, this systematic
review seeks to identify opportunities to shorten waiting times for elective surgery with a
particular focus on patient prioritisation methods. It seeks to answer the following “What are
the effective patient prioritisation methods to reduce waiting times for elective surgeries and
how consistent were those results to different elective surgical specialties, institutions, and
health systems?”

METHODS
This review is one of the sub-reviews in a major systematic review conducted with a broader
search to support a holistic approach to finding solutions for long waiting times for elective
surgery. It assesses patient prioritisation as one strategy among a much wider scope of
approaches. The full, portfolio review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019158455) and
its PRISMA flow diagram is attached (Supplementary online file 1). The broad scope allows

for the inclusion of all methods, strategies, and policies to reduce waiting times for elective
surgery. For this sub-review, studies on patient prioritisation methods were deemed eligible,
and it was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA statement and checklist
(Supplementary online file 2). Given that healthcare system interventions are often tested in
quasi-experimental studies or observational studies, rather than experimental studies (such as
randomised trials), a range of study designs were eligible for this review. With this in mind and
because the validity of the results of any systematic review of health system interventions is
dependent on the use of relevant evidence and synthesis methods (21), we used design-specific
tools to evaluate the risks of bias associated (22), as discussed below.
Data sources for the portfolio review:
We searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library using
combinations of search terms. After pilot searches, we finalised a detailed search strategy
which consisted of three sets of search terms without language restrictions. The searches were
run from 14 December 2019 to 7 January 2020, for articles published from 1 January 2014 to
December 2019. The search strategy used for PubMed is presented in Supplementary online
file 3.
Criteria for considering studies for the review:
We included studies that investigated interventions and strategies intended to reduce waiting
time for elective surgery. We included original research published in journal papers, reports,
editorials, and literature reviews from the health sector, government, and related sectors. We
included experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies, as well as systematic
reviews published during 2014-2019. Qualitative and quantitative data were considered for
data synthesis; but simulation and modelling studies were excluded, because they might not be
a reliable guide to the effects in real-world scenarios.

Eligible participants are adult patients (≥18 years) registered for elective surgery. Patients
undergoing emergency surgery and surgery for paediatric conditions were excluded. Studies
of waiting times for day surgery or ambulatory surgery were eligible. Studies with patients
waiting for all types of major elective surgery were eligible, except for those of patients waiting
for cancer or cancer-related surgeries. The surgeries require penetration of a body cavity are
considered as major surgeries and all surgeries of abdomen, chest or cranium are considered
major surgeries. Minor surgeries are generally superficial and do not require penetration of a
body cavities (23). Although most eye surgeries are minor surgeries, studies on eye surgery
lists were included as an exception, because these have some of the longest surgery waiting
lists in many countries (24). For this review, where a study was based in a clinic or outpatient
department, we required that the investigation was targeted on the prioritisation of patients
registered for elective surgery, rather than patients waiting for other procedures.
Article selection and data extraction:
DR and VJ to select relevant articles checked the title and the abstract of retrieved citations.
Articles that were deemed potentially eligible based on their title or abstract were retrieved in
full and assessed for eligibility and relevance. Each potentially eligible article was discussed
with the third reviewer (MC) and agreement was reached on inclusion or exclusion.
Synthesis of results:
The portfolio review includes a wider scope and data synthesis for this review was carried out
as a single subgroup analysis of that wide series of systematic reviews. Meta-analyses were not
applicable for this review because of the heterogeneity in study designs and variability of the
approaches to how the outcome of interest was measured. Instead, we planned a meta-synthesis
with narrative analysis. Given the types of study that we identified, we used the ROBINS-I tool
(25) for quality evaluation in non-randomized intervention studies and the CASP tool (Critical

Appraisal of Skill Programme) for observational studies (26). We would have used the
Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials, but none were identified for this review. We
used common criteria to report the overall quality of evidence in observational studies.
RESULTS
The article screening process is shown as a PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1). The electronic
search for the full review yielded 7543 records from the five bibliographic databases. This
reduced to 5346 after deduplication in EndNote citation management software. During the title
and abstract screening process, 362 potentially relevant citations were selected, and this was
reduced to 196 articles after full article screening for the extended scope of the full, portfolio
review. Of these, 105 simulation and modelling studies were rejected at this stage. After
grouping the citations to different strategies for the same intended outcome of reducing waiting
times, 17 articles were judged eligible for this sub-review because their major emphasis was
on methods for prioritising patients to reduce waiting time for elective surgery.
Our primary outcome variable is waiting time, which was defined as the period between a
surgeon placing a patient on the waiting list for a particular elective surgery and the day that
the surgery is performed. In total, we included 17 studies that were published between 2014
and 2019: four quasi-experimental studies, 11 observational studies and two systematic
reviews. A summary is presented in Table 1. Of the 15 original studies (excluding the two
systematic reviews), ten described prioritisation as a health system-wide approach, and five
tested patient prioritisation as an institutional measure, investigating the association of waiting
time with an explicit prioritisation guideline.

Summary of included studies:
The characteristics of the 17 included studies are summarised below and further details are
given in Table 2.
Laberge (27) investigated the effects of delays and waiting times for total joint replacement
(TJR) surgery using observational study methods. The study was conducted in a universityaffiliated hospital in 2014-2015 in Canada. The results identified multiple factors that
significantly affected the efficiency of the TJR surgery process, with proper patient
prioritisation being among the recommendations to investigate, along with process engineering
with health services and management research.
Casimiro-Perez (28) reported a clinical prioritisation system for patients on a waiting list for
bariatric surgery, called the Obesity Surgery Score (OSS), in Spain. This observational study
was conducted with the OSS for different hospital waiting lists and it concluded that applying
a structured prioritisation system such as OSS to bariatric surgery waiting lists might improve
patient prognosis, timeliness of surgery, and cost optimization.

Hunter (29) reported a quasi-experimental study to pilot a General Surgery Prioritisation Tool
(GSPT) with an existing triage system of clinical judgment, in New Zealand. A cohort of 392
patients added to a waiting list between July 2015 and February 2016 was selected for the
intervention. The tool was found to be clinically reliable, with the advantage of being a more
explicit process.
Nganga (30) reported a cohort study from Australia, including 308 patients undergoing total
hip or knee arthroplasty from June 2008 to March 2009. The study examined pre-operative and
post-operative Multi-Attribute Prioritisation Tool (MAPT) scores for these patients. The results
indicated that the patients who were prioritised by the MAPT questionnaire had an improved
MAPT score of zero or close to zero postoperatively.
Selvaggi (31) discussed moral principles that can be incorporated in prioritisation criteria and
used to guide decision making by health professionals. It recommended the implementation of
patient-informed preferences for plastic surgery patients presenting with non–life-threatening
conditions in Sweden.
Tuulonen (32) reported an intervention study to improve access and productivity for eye care
in Finland. Along with other strategies, patient prioritisation on the basis of patients’ risk for
permanent visual disability increased the number of surgical procedures throughout the period
(2014 to 2015).
Gangstoe (33) reported a cross-sectional study of the variation in priority status and waiting
times across different medical disciplines for elective patients admitted to specialized services
in Norway, in 2010. Considerable variation was found across medical specialties, with causes
for variation often interpreted as differences in clinical judgment and capacity.

Gunaratnam (34) conducted a qualitative study to examine neurosurgical patients’ views on
the prioritisation of patients for operating theatre in Canada in 2015. They interviewed 37
patients and concluded in favour of having a prioritisation list based on fair methodology.
Sutherland (10) conducted a cross-sectional study to report the health status of patients waiting
for elective surgery and to provide insight into policies for refining surgical wait time policies.
A total of 3759 patients responded to the survey questions. The findings indicated the need for
non-surgical interventions while patients were waiting for elective surgery, pointing to a range
of policy options for triaging elective surgery patients.
Chan (35) reported a cohort study to test the reliability and validity of the Impact on Life (IoL)
patient-rated questionnaire for use in prioritising orthopaedic surgeries. 324 patients responded
to the questionnaire over a 5-month period in 2013. The IoL was judged to be a relevant,
comprehensive and user-friendly tool for use in the prioritisation of elective surgical services.
Gutacker (36) reported a descriptive study of how patients are prioritised in hip and knee
replacement surgeries in the UK, during 2009 to 2014. The authors concluded that the factor
of not practicing formal and explicit prioritisation system for elective surgeries in English NHS
hospitals was one major cause for lengthening waiting lists for elective surgery.
Tebé (37) reported an evaluation of the impact of using a priority system for primary knee
arthroplasty (PKA), in Spain. Data from a management registry in the period of 2003 to 2009
were analysed, with 67,403 patients included. The study concluded that although a
prioritisation system for PKA had been implemented, it had no effect on the prioritisation of
patients based on their severity.
Gill (38) reported an observational study that examined patients’ perspectives regarding
prioritisation for bariatric surgery and the willingness to pay for faster access, in Canada. 99
patients responded (2010 to 2011) and most considered greater clinical severity and functional

impairments related to obesity to be important prioritisation indicators and disagreed with
paying for faster access.
Johar (39) reported an intervention study to investigate how the introduction of an explicit
prioritisation guideline affected the prioritisation behaviour of doctors in Australia during 2004
to 2010. The study revealed that the presence of a simple clinical priority guideline at the
procedural level did not produce systematic, clinically based prioritisation behaviours among
doctors.
Ng and Lundstrom (40) reported waiting times for cataract surgery in Sweden following the
adoption of the National Indications model for Cataract Extraction (NIKE) tool for prioritizing
patients. There were 141,070 surgeries during the study period (2009 to 2011) and mean
waiting times decreased across all NIKE groups, with an annual increase of surgery rate around
6%.
Rahimi (41) is a systematic review of studies for the prioritisation of elective surgical patients
considering the prioritisation of individual surgeons’ patients. They searched OVID
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science in 2017. A single study was eligible form the
screening and it was from the main author. This illustrated the use of prioritisation of patients
among the waiting lists of two individual orthopaedic surgeons in a large teaching hospital in
Iran.
Bachelet (18) is a scoping review of studies of interventions that have been implemented to
reduce waiting times for major elective surgeries. They searched six electronic databases up to
December 2017 and included 12 eligible studies. They assessed the quality of the evidence
with EPOC (The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care) and GRADE (Grades
of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) tools, and rated the overall
quality of all studies as low. They concluded that there is a need for multidimensional

interventions based on prioritisation strategies, and quality management improvements of the
surgical pathways and improvements in the planning of the surgical schedule.
Risk of bias in included studies
The quality of the individual studies that we included in this review was measured using two
tools. In addition to the four intervention studies, we evaluated three of the other studies with
ROBINS-I considering the longitudinal assessment of their outcome variable (29, 30, 35). The
relevant CASP reading tool was used to evaluate the other ten studies.
ROBINS-I: We judged five studies to have an overall moderate quality ((29, 30, 35, 37, 40)
and two studies to have a serious risk of bias in their methodology (32, 39). Details of ROBINSI evaluation for each domain is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
All seven of these studies had inclusion and exclusion criteria for study participants, but none
had used randomisation to allocate participants to the assessed prioritisation processes. We
identified moderate risk of bias due to confounding for baseline characteristics of the
comparison groups in all studies. One study had a critical risk of bias due to confounding
because of the changing of the research setting during the intervention (moved to a new hospital
building), although it reported change in pre and post stages of intervention measures (32).
There was a low risk of bias in the selection of the participants in all studies because patients
were recruited as entire blocks to each study. The bias in the classification of the intervention
was low in all studies because the interventions were implemented in pre-post design methods,
with participants unaware of the prioritisation scoring at the clinics. The introduced
interventions are explicit prioritisation guidelines and most indicators are dependent on
objective parameters. Therefore, there were no significant deviations reported from the
intended intervention. There were no missing data reported in any of the studies, because
waiting times were extracted from regular patient records in administrative documents.

However, one study had a serious risk of selection bias of reported results because of the
limitation of using admission data only from those patients who had completed the waiting
period. In this study, the number of patients who had not attended the admission was not
reported (39). Outcome variables included in many studies were as intended, namely a
measurement of the time spent on the waiting list, which was unbiased.

CASP tools: The main outcome variable of interest for this review is a time-to-event
measurement, which required the follow up of a cohort of patients and various time
measurements in these study participants. We applied the CASP checklist for cohort studies to
six included studies (10, 27, 28, 33, 36, 38) and the CASP checklist for Qualitative studies to
two studies (31, 34). The two systematic reviews were assessed using the CASP checklist for
systematic reviews.
We assessed most studies to be of moderate to low risk of bias. The evidence from most studies
is sufficient to support their results (10, 27, 31, 33, 34, 36, 41, 42) . However, one study
demonstrated poor study methodology because confounding factors were not considered when

DISCUSSION
Seventeen research studies were eligible for this narrative synthesis. Meta-analyses were not
possible

or

appropriate

because

of

the

substantial

heterogeneity

across

the

studies. Prioritisation strategies for waiting lists incorporate equity criteria (44) and, so, as a
first step in our narrative synthesis, we focused on the levels of implementation of the
prioritisation systems in each study. Many prioritisation scores were recommended to be used
for individual disciplines and there were two apparent approaches. First, is the generic approach
that could be used as a universal prioritisation criterion for all types of elective surgeries (10,
39, 45). Secondly, the prioritisation criteria were specifically based on measures related to the
particular clinical status and recommended for managing the queue for a particular surgery or
surgical specialty: orthopaedic surgery (27, 30, 35-37), general surgery (29), neurosurgery (33,
34), bariatric surgery (38, 42), eye surgery (32) and plastic surgery (31).
The goals of a prioritisation methodology should be achieved with scientifically valid
prioritisation tools with a transparent mechanism (46). The presented studies have variable
risks of bias at varying stages, due to deficiencies in their methods (Table 2) and their results
are mixed. The total joint replacement surgery patients that were prioritised by the MAPT
(Multi attribute Prioritisation Tool) had improved clinical outcomes with a significantly shorter
waiting time (30). Similarly, prioritising patients for cataract surgery using the NIKE (National
Indications model for Cataract Extraction) tool reduced waiting times for surgery for those with
the greatest need (40). One included study reported on variations of prioritisation among
different medical disciplines, which was interpreted mostly as the result of the differences in
clinical judgment in various clinical scenarios (33). None of the studies investigated vertical
equity approaches of prioritising methods to re-order the waiting list for different elective
surgeries using different weights across disciplines, besides vertical equity is often justified by
clinical urgency (47). However, standardised universal prioritisation tools were recommended

in one study to maintain vertical equity, which would re-order the queue for different specialties
in the theatre time allocated to different elective surgery lists (10).
The adverse health outcomes due to long waiting lists for elective surgery are a general policy
issue in many countries (48-50). Many of the prioritisation-related interventions that were
tested in included studies, were aimed to implement in regional levels or as health system-wide
approaches (10, 27, 31, 33, 36-40, 42) while a smaller number of studies focused on single
surgery units or individual hospitals (29, 30, 32, 34, 35).
Prioritisation tools based on objective measures of disease severity scales are known as Clinical
Priority Assessment Criteria (CPAC) and these have been commonly used in public
hospitals (51). Irrespective of whether an explicit CPAC based on clinical parameters was
available, it was reported that the order of patients in the surgery list was nearly the same, since
clinicians have naturally used their own best judgment to order the queue for the surgery, based
on clinical urgency (37). This reflects that clinical parameters alone will not demonstrate the
pure urgency and suffering of the respective patient’s condition.
Previous research has identified many potential structural barriers to equitable access to
elective surgical care (51) and the importance of prioritisation to the fair allocation for services.
Longer waiting times have shown higher detrimental effects to people in lower socio-economic
categories (52). Consideration of such equity principles, moral considerations and socioeconomic parameters of the patients were suggested as ways to determine the genuine priority
access for elective surgery in some included studies (10, 35). The importance of considering
moral concerns of patients for prioritisation has also been highlighted for non–life-threatening
conditions, such as elective plastic surgeries (31). The added advantage of considering the
patients’ perspectives minimises discrimination and leads to patient-centred operating systems.

Some studies included in this review showed that multi-attributes in the prioritisation tools
tested for the selected surgeries had a strong association with shorter waiting times along with
better post-surgical treatment outcomes (17, 30).
This review also explored different practical approaches to obtain objective measurements for
priority scoring. To avoid the limitations of subjective assessments, some studies have
recommended the combination of clinician judgment with investigations, reports and details of
patient-reported concerns to develop a fair prioritisation tool (10, 31). Instead of the surgeon’s
assessment of the clinical or anatomical features of the patient, patient-reported perceived
health concerns (40) might indicate a greater need for surgery to a particular patient than others
in the queue.
Manipulations and resistance for implementing priority-scoring systems by clinicians have
been reported in some studies (51, 53). Similarly, one included study reported that the doctors
had not complied with a simple clinical priority guideline which was implemented at the
procedural level (39). This indicates the need to convince clinicians on the relative importance
of prioritisation and the need to include non-medical factors when determining access to
rationed services.
One of the systematic reviews that we included assessed the factors of prioritisation of elective
surgical patients in a single surgeon’s waiting list, where the same surgery is managed by many
surgeons with multiple surgical lists (41). Unacceptable variability among waiting times in the
same specialty in different surgeons or centres and variability in waiting times among different
specialties need to be balanced to achieve horizontal and vertical equity for access to health
care (44). Adapting prioritisation principles at earlier stages, when the patients were referred
to surgical clinics has also been shown to be effective in providing timely services (54). This
information might help healthcare managers and policy makers to enhance the local
applicability of the implemented prioritisation tools and methods.

LIMITATIONS OF THIS REVIEW
Our review focused solely on reducing waiting times for elective surgeries and did not include
results for patient prioritisation methods used for other purposes, which might also inform
decision about strategies for waiting times for elective surgeries. Although there may be
multiple purposes, most literature suggests that reducing waiting times for patients in most
need is the primary purpose of using prioritisation principals to reorder the queue. Limiting the
eligible articles to those published in the six years from 2014-2019 means that we may have
failed to include earlier studies that would provide useful evidence. However, relying on recent
studies increases the applicability of the results to contemporary practice in healthcare
systems. The review includes observational studies, which limits the strength of our
recommendations about the effects of interventions, but in the absence of randomised trials,
these provide the best available evidence. The included studies assessed prioritisation measures
focused on a variety of elective surgery specialties and we did not attempt to summarise the

given prioritisation parameters to individual surgeries. Instead, we aimed to provide a holistic
approach for prioritisation policies, which could be customised to adapt to any healthcare
system. Finally, we have not been able to use the quantitative results of the studies to present
meta-analyses of the effects of the interventions or to determine if publication bias has
impacted on our conclusions, because of the heterogeneity among the studies.

CONCLUSIONS
Considering all the quality appraised evidence in the 17 included studies, we have found that
this suggests that strategies that support the prioritisation methods suggest can achieve faster
access for the patients on waiting lists who are in most need of the surgical care. Having
standardised specific prioritisation tools for each specialty is more likely to be effective for
horizontal equity by re-ordering the queue of patients waiting for a particular surgery list, but
is unlikely to impact on vertical equity across different types of surgery or condition. In
addition to clinical assessments, incorporating socio-economic parameters and patients’ moral
considerations into prioritisation scoring systems is more effective and more likely to avoid
system-associated discrimination in certain surgical specialties. It is challenging to formulate
a transparent and consistent national prioritisation system for elective surgeries, but an explicit
prioritisation tool with a transparent and objective scoring system based on clear evidencebased criteria might reduce the waiting time for elective surgery.
In summary, this review has listed some factors in a framework (Figure 4) that would address
the most important questions asked by healthcare managers and policy makers when seeking a
fair prioritisation system for elective surgeries to overcome limitations with local variations.
This may be especially important given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective
surgery waiting lists in many countries, and the depletion of resources for routine health care.

However, more research is needed, ideally in the form of randomised trials to quantify the
effects of these interventions, as well as economic evaluations leading more precise evidenceinformed decision-making.

Length of time spent on the waiting
list did not impact improvement
scores for middle and low priority
patients.
A specific anatomical feature is not
always an indicator of patient’s
well-being, good policies should
identify the worst-off, and those
who can mostly benefit from
surgery such as a patient-centred
operating system, and patient’s
informed preferences.

views on the
prioritization of
patients for operating
theatre.
To understand the
health status of
patients waiting for
elective surgery,
potential gaps in their
care, how different
patients are affected
and provide insight
into policies for
refining surgical wait
time policies.

Variations in prioritization
practice/registration practices were
found across different medical
specialties, both in the proportion
of patients given priority status and
the individually assigned maximum
waiting times. One hypothesis for A
considerable variation across
clinical disciplines exists in the
proportion of priority patients and
in their assigned individual
maximum waiting times.
Introduction of maximum waiting
times may have contributed to push
the actual waiting time towards the
maximum assigned waiting time.
The participants were in favour of
having a prioritization list based on
fairness and good reasons.

Health
System

Data collected from 20122016.
Measured different aspects
of participants’ health,
including their general
health, pain, and
depression.

The high rates of pain and
depression not only have
implications for patients’ immediate
health, but may also affect longterm surgical outcomes. Policy
options include re-examining the
surgical triage system and
expanding surgical capacity to
match self-reported health.

Most patients waiting for bariatric
surgery consider greater clinical
severity and functional impairments
related to obesity to be important
prioritization indicators and
disagreed with paying for faster
access.
