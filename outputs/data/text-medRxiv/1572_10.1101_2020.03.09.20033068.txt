Summary
Background In December 2019, viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by the novel
coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly worldwide, the illness
progress

of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in partial patients is rapid and the

mortality rate is relatively high. The present study aims to describe the clinical features in
the death cases with COVID-19.
Methods In this single center and observational study, we recruited 101 death cases with
COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Wuhan
Jinyintan Hospital. Demographics, underlying diseases, X-ray/CT images, possible
therapy strategies and test results were collected and analyzed on patients admission to
the ICU and 48 hours before deaths .
Findings Of 101 COVID-19 dead cases, 47 patients went directly to the ICU because of

Over fifty six percent (56.4%) of patients were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and
43.6% were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.Among them, 64 were males and
37 were females, with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). Interestingly, all deaths
shwed significant difference in blood type distribution, with 44.44% of type A , 29.29%
of type B , 8.08% of type AB, and 18.19% of type O.The clinical manifestations of the
novel coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptoms included fever

Neutrophils,

procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP),and interleukin-6(IL-6), D-dimer gradually
increased with progress of the disease. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most
patients at admission, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. Sixty
one (60.40%) patients were given antiviral drugs, 59(58.42%),received glucocorticoids,
63.37% were given intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% were treated with
thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) were given
restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) were administrated to antifungal drugs. Non-invasive
ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy were given in 84(83.17%) patients , and invasive
mechanical ventilation was used in 76.24% patients . The median time from acute
respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00
days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days
(IQR2.00-8.00).

1. INTRODUCTION
Viral pneumonia outbreaks caused by novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China
in December 2019, and spread rapidly worldwide[1-5]. The illness progress of partial
patients wasrapid and the mortality was found to be 3.4%. By 5th March, 2020, the
cumulative number of infections worldwide reached 95,333 cases, of which 3,282 died[5].
In 30th January, 2020, the World Health Organization issued a global warning about the
highly contagious virus[6], which was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
11th February[7]. Current studies[8-10] demonstrated that COVID-19 often occured in
elderly men with underlying diseases based on the laboratory and clinical features. In

early stage, fever and dry cough with reduced number of lymphocytes were the major
manifestations,

fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure were

advanced in the late stage.
However, there have been few studies on the clinical characteristics of death cases
due to the small sample size. To understand the clinical characteristics, a retrospective
analysis of clinical features in 101 death cases in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital was carried
out.
2. METHODS
2.1. Study Population
This study collected death cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020
in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The Hospital specialize for infectious diseases,
prescribed by Chinese government as one of the first designated treatment units for
patients with the disease. The diagnosis of confirmed and clinical cases was made
following Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial version 5)[11].
The confirmed cases were those who had pathogenic evidence, positive RT-PCR or
highly homologous gene sequencing with known coronavirus. The clinical cases were
those who had epidemic history, or clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics.
Epidemic history means that the suspected cases has travelling history in Wuhan and
surrounding areas within 14 days, or exposed to other infections, communicated with
patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or from
case-reporting communities, or clustering onset. The clinical features include fever or

respiratory symptoms, and decreased lymphocyte or leukocyte count in the early stage.
This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital
(KY-2020-28.01), and all relevant personnel exempts from informed consent due to the
particularity of the disease outbreak.
2.2. Data Collection
The retrospective analysis was based on the case reports, nursing records, test results,
and imaging results. Data include demographics, underlying diseases, X-ray/CT results,
possible therapy strategies and test results of patients on admission to ICU or 48 h before
deaths. The therapy strategy represents antiviral and antibacterial treatments,
corticosteroid treatment, immunotherapy, and respiratory therapy. The onset time was
defined as the day symptom appeared. Records began from onset to admission, admission
to ICU, ICU periods, and onset to deaths.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
We compared the differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures
among patients died of COVID-19 at onset to admission, admission to ICU and 48h
before deaths.We present continuous measurements as mean (SD) if they were normally
distributed or median (IQR) if not, and categorical variables were described as frequency
rates and percentages(%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the
measurements were outside the normal range. SPSS (version 24.0) was used for all
analyses.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Demographics
By Feb 16, 2020, 101 cases died of COVID-19 in ICU of Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital, among them 57 (56.44%) patients were confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%)
were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria. In the death cases, 47 went directly to the
ICU because of critical condition, and 54 were transferred to ICU with aggravated
condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patient died of acute coronary
syndrome, while the rest died of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by
COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females, with the age range of 24-83 and
average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had underlying diseases with
hypertension(42.57%), diabetes (22.77%), neurological disease (9.90%), malignant tumor
(4.95%), and respiratory disease( 4.95%). The cases with more than two underlying
diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history in South China
Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type
distribution was significantly different, with type A (44.44%), type B (29.29%), type AB
(8.08%) and type O (18.19%). The median time from onset to hospital was 11.00 days

3.2. Clinical Features
The relative frequencies of all reported symptoms at the time of admission are

shown in Table 2. The most common symptom was fever (91,90.10% of 101 patients),
but most patients presented normal temperature after 1-3 days of admission , which may
be related to hormone use. Cough (69 [68.32%]) and dyspnea (75 [74.26%]) were also
common. Additionally, 31(30.69%) patients had white sputum in the early stage , and 3
patients showed yellowish purulent sputum. Fifty(49.50%) patients showed acute
respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) on admission, and the median time from onset to
ARDS was 12 days(IQR9.00-14.00). Other common symptoms included myalgia, general
weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, among them 86(85.15%) had more
than two symptoms. Twenty one (20.79%) patients had no respiratory symptoms, and
7(6.93%) showed nausea and vomiting. Distinctive from Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), only 2 patients with COVID-19 had diarrhea.
3.3. Radiographic Findings
Most of patients (99 [98.02%] of 101 patients) had abnormal lung imaging at the
time of initial admission, 6(5.94%) patients had single-lung and 93(92.08%)

had

double-lung abnormalities. The disease initially showed scattered plaque-like ground
glass in the lungs. Dynamic imaging showed progressive multi-spot patchy shadows in
both lungs. Pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 3 (2.97%) patients.
3.4. Laboratory Findings
Blood routine, biochemical reports and inflammation of cases during admission to
ICU and 48h before deaths were collected. Most patients showed increased numbers of
leukocytes and neutrophils, and decreased lymphocytes count at time of consultation.The

inflammatory indicators such as neutrophils, procalcitonin(PCT),C-reactive protein(CRP),
and interleukin-6(IL-6) gradually increased as time went on. It was found that the count
of patient's platelets(PLT) decreased, D-dimer and Prothrombin time(PT) increased
correspondingly during disease progression by dynamic analysis of coagulation-related
indicators. Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%]
of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were
significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial
damage in the early stage. We also found that liver and kidney damages were not
significant at the time of admission and when transferred to ICU, and it significantly
turned to be worse 48h before deaths. Experiment data can be seen in Table 3-5 and
Figure1.
3.5. Treatments
Ninety seven patients were transferred to the hospital based on laboratory diagnosis
or deterioration after treatments in other hospitals. All patients were treated in isolated
wards. Among them, 61(60.40%) received antiviral drugs, including Oseltamivir,
Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Ganciclovir, or Interferon, etc. Glucocorticoids,
intravenous immunoglobulins, and thymosin preparations were used in, 59(58.42%),
64(63.37%) , and 45(44.55%) patients, respectively.. All patients received antibiotic
treatment, including cephalosporins and quinolones. More than half of patients received
restricted antibiotics(63,62.38%), including carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline, etc., due
to repeated fever or fluctuation of inflammation indicators. 23(22.78%) patients received
antifungal drugs.

All patients received oxygen therapy. 84(83.17%) patients were treated with
non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy, and 77(76.24%), invasive
mechanical ventilation. The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation
was 3.00 days(IQR0.00-6.00), of which 21 patients were intubated 2 days before deaths.
The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 1–31 days (median 5 days
[IQR2.00-8.00]). Seven patients were treated with Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation(ECMO) and eight with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy(CRRT).
4. DISCUSSION
The present analyses revealed the clinical characteristics of 101 deaths caused by
COVID-19 in China. Based on our knowledge, this is the largest sample among the
reports on the clinical characteristics of dead patients although some studies described a
limited number of deaths.
Up to 5th March, 2020, the cumulative number of infected victims was 95,333, and
the number of deaths reached 3,282 in many countries of the world. The mortality was up
to 3.4%, which is significantly high compared with that of common pneumonia. Among
the 101 deaths, males dominated and the proportion of elderly patients with underlying
diseases was relatively high. Importantly, we found that the blood group distribution of
the deaths (A-42.57%, B-30.69%, O-17.82%, AB-8.91%) remarkably differred from that
of Han population in Wuhan[12]. Type O was relatively low but Type A was relatively high.
ABO blood group antigen substances are widely distributed in the human respiratory ,
digestive tract , and reproductive systems[13]. Previous researches have shown that ABO

blood group are related to the onset and spread of various diseases because the blood
group antigens may involve in virus infection as receptor[14-15]. In the study of various
susceptible genes in SARS-CoV, individuals in the blood group O had a lower infection
rate[16]. Guillon et al. found that type A antibody can provide protection by inhibiting
interaction between the virus and ACE2 receptor[17]. However, the higher proportion of
patients with type A blood remains unclear although the lack of antibody A protection
might be involved. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism by which the
patients of type A is more susceptibe to COVID-19 infection.
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are non-specific, which is consistent with
previous studies[10], the most common symptom is fever. However, not all patients had
fever, for instance, no fever was noted in 10(9.90%) patients on the onset of disease.
Moreover, 21(20.79%) of the patients had no respiratory symptoms in the begining of the
disease, and fever and chest tightness gradually occurred with the disease progressed.
Therefore, the delay of fever and respiratory symptoms may affect the early identification
of COVID-19 .
The mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, but its mechanism is not
clear at present, and it may be related to the virus-induced acute lung injury,
inflammatory factor storm, multiple organ damage and secondary nosocomial infections.
We collected laboratory examination results of patients at admission, at the time of
transfer to the ICU, and at 48h before deaths, and found that 71(70.30%) of patients had
an elevated level of IL-6 when they were admitted to the hospital, and it gradually
increased with the disease progressed and was up to 26.21pg/mL(IQR11.68-205.92) 48h

before deaths, significantly higher than results reported by Chen et al[9]，indicating a
severe inflammatory reaction.We found that 23(22.78%) of patients had abnormal
coagulation function at admission, which is mainly manifested as increased D-dimer and
a sudden deterioration. Under this circumstance,

attention should be paid to the

presence of pulmonary thromboembolism after micro-thrombosis in the lungs or deep
vein thrombosis. For hypercoagulable patients without contraindications, reasonable
anticoagulant therapy is a possible choice.
It has been reported that 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCov) can damage function
of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, heart, or liver, etc., but no relevant description was
seen of the involvement sequence of other organs except lung. We collected indicators of
organ damage when patients were admitted to the hospital and found that most of patients
had myocardial damage，among them 32 patients were exclusively complicated with
myocardial damage. Both 2019-nCov and 2003-SARS belong to the genus β coronavirus ,
and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been confirmed as a common
pathogenic receptor[19]. Thirty one percent of ICU patients were found to have significant
abnormalities in Troponin I(TNI) [8]. We noted that TNI was significantly elevated in the
ICU patients or before deaths compared with primary admission to hospital. Further
analysis revealed that patients who were hospitalized with elevated troponin underwent a
fast progress from onset to ICU and to death. The results suggest that heart is a potential
targeted organ by 2019-nCOV in the disease process. Thus monitoring and prediction
of heart injury would be needed at early stage as well as in the course of disease.
Additionally, we found that with the disease progressed, counts of leukocytes,

level gradually increased, while lymphocytes increased

again after the decline, and some patients experienced a drop of body temperature and
then increased or continued fever fluctuations. These indicators do not fully meet the
characteristics of viral infections. It is necessary to be alert to that patients who may have
hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially bacterial infections. The sputum culture results
also indicated bacterial and fungal infections, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans in some patients. Secondary bacterial and
fungal infections may be related to suppressed immunity,
unsmooth sputum drainage. In addition,

lack of medical resources and

clinical manifestations of bacterial or fungal

infections in critical patients may be unconspicuous due to their compromised immunity
or hormone therapy. Therefore, it is essential to keep monitoring temperature, laboratory
indicators, imaging indicators and airway secretion characteristics of the patients.
Prevention and control of nosocomial infections also needed .
In terms of treatment, usage of antiviral drugs and hormones and related course is
still controversial. In this study, 60.40% of patients received antiviral drugs, 58.42%
patients were given glucocorticoids, and the treatment course was mostly 3-5 days. All
patients received antibiotic treatments including cephalosporins and quinolones. More
than half of patients received restricted antibiotics due to fluctuations of body
temperature or inflammation indicators. Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive
treatment for critically ill patients, but the overall survival time of patients after invasive
mechanical ventilation was short(median 5 days [IQR2.00-8.00]), and most patients did
not benefit significantly from invasive mechanical ventilation and had suffered multiple

organ failure caused by severe hypoxia before invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore,
for critical patients, early invasive mechanical ventilation treatment should be in
consideration.
This study has some limitations. Only the critical death patients are included, and
no comparison was made between the improvement groups. The sample size can be
increased in further research for prospective case-control study. The blood group
composition of patients cannot be statistically analyzed and whether the blood group
difference is related to the susceptibility of COVID-19 infection needs to be clarified.
5. CONCLUSION
Critical COVID-19 may cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple
organ failure with high mortality rate.The blood group distribution of the deaths
remarkably differred from that of Han population in Wuhan.Heart may be the earliest
damaged organ except the lungs. Hospital-acquired pneumonia in the later period is
worthy of attention.
