Abstract
Pregnant women are vulnerable group in viral outbreaks especially in the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The aim of this review was to identify maternal and neonatal outcomes
in available articles on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. The articles that had assessed outcomes of
pregnancy and perinatal of women with COVID-19 between Oct 2019 and Apr 30, 2020 without language
limitation were considered. All kinds of studies such as case report, case series, retrospective cohort, case
control were included. We searched databases, selected relevant studies and extracted data regarding maternal
and neonatal outcomes from each article. Data of 287 pregnant women with COVID-19 of 6 countries were
assessed from 28 articles between December 8, 2019 and April 6, 2020. Most pregnant women reported in their
third trimester, 102 (35.5%) cases were symptomatic at the time of admission. Common onset symptoms,
abnormal laboratory findings, and chest computed tomography pattern were fever (51.5%), lymphocytopenia
(67.9%), and multiple ground-glass opacities (78.5%) respectively. 93% of all deliveries were done through
cesarean section. No maternal mortality and 3 % ICU admission were reported. Vertical transmission was not
reported but its possibility was suggested in three neonates. One neonatal death, one stillbirth, and one abortion
were reported. All newborns were not breastfed. This review showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal
outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in comparison with previous coronavirus outbreak infection in
pregnancy. Limited data are available regarding possibility of virus transmission in utero, during vaginal
childbirth and breastfeeding. Effect of COVID-19 on first and second trimester and ongoing pregnancy
outcomes in infected mothers is still questionable.

1. Introduction
Outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a new respiratory disease has affected over two million individuals
throughout the world and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak as a global
pandemic on March11, 2020 [1,2]. Understanding of the effect of viral infection during pregnancy is
considerably important especially in pandemic due to possible effect on the pregnant woman and the fetus [3].
Studies showed that pregnant mothers were vulnerable group in viral outbreaks of influenza-A, H1N1, the
severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), Ebola, and Zika virus and had higher risk of mortality and worse maternal and neonatal
outcomes such as abortion, still birth, preterm delivery, and birth defects [4-8].
Some conditions increase vulnerability of mothers and fetuses to become infected with outbreak viruses
especially respiratory viruses. The first one is maternal physiologic adaptive changes in cardiopulmonary system
during pregnancy which leads to increased heart rate, and stroke volume, and reduced pulmonary residual
capacity. These changes could increase the risk of hypoxemia [9]. The second issue is maternal immunologic
alterations and a shift from Th1 to Th2 immunity that occurs during pregnancy. This shift could decrease the
robustness of cell-mediated immunity, alter responses to viral respiratory infections during pregnancy, and
increase severity of these infections [10,11]. The third factor is related to characteristics of innate and adaptive
immunity in fetus including lower cytolytic function of fetal natural killer (NK) cells compared to adults, lower
intensity of antigen-specific antibody response in comparison with adults, immature T cell immunity with
suppressed Th1 responses and upregulated Th2 responses, hyporesponsive macrophages, and scarce soluble
inflammatory mediators [12-14]. All of these characteristics increase fetal susceptibility to infections.
Furthermore, a viral infection of placenta could produce inflammatory cytokines, activate maternal immune
system, impair placenta, induce abortion or preterm labor in perinatal period and lead to long-term
neurodevelopmental sequelae in adulthood [15-17].
Despite some similarities among COVID-19, SARS and MERS, the 2019 novel coronavirus seems to be less
lethal and more easily spread than the other two coronavirus according to available information [18]. This
characteristic could raise critical concern as regards widespread transmission in the community and increase
infected pregnant women numbers and the possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mother to the
fetus, and adverse outcome on maternal, fetal and neonatal health.

Current knowledge related to effect of COVID-19 infection on maternal and perinatal outcomes are based on
information that exists in some scattered case reports and case series which were mostly reported from Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China. It seems that better clinical management of the infection in pregnancy needs to have
more information of COVID-19 behavior in a large number of infected pregnant cases in different trimesters
from various countries. This review was conducted to identify maternal and neonatal outcomes in available
articles on pregnancies affected by COVID-19 throughout the world.

2. Materials and Methods
Eligibility criteria
In this review, the articles that had assessed outcomes of pregnancy and perinatal of women with COVID-19
between Oct 2019 and Apr 30, 2020 were considered. All kinds of studies such as case report, case series,
retrospective cohort, case control were included. Non-English language publications were also included and data
extraction of them was used through Google Translator.

We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and MedRxiv using MeSH-compliant keywords
including: "2019-nCoV infection", "coronavirus disease 2019", "COVID-19 pandemic", "2019-nCoV disease",
"2019 novel coronavirus disease", "COVID19", "2019 novel coronavirus infection", "coronavirus disease-19",
"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "SARS-CoV-2", "pregnancy", "pregnant women",
"maternal", and "prenatal care". Search strategy of them is mentioned in Appendix 1. Relevant studies [19-46]
were selected based on titles and abstracts, then their full texts were assessed by two reviewers. The following
data were extracted from each article: name of the first author, time of study, the number of mothers and
neonates, mother's age, gestational age, delivery mode, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and COVID-19 vertical
transmission (Table 1).

3. Results
A flow diagram of the literature search is shown in Figure 1. From 77 results in PubMed, 13 in Scopus, 7 in
WOS, and 45 in MedRxiv, 28 relevant studies (15 case series, 10 case reports, 1 case-control, 2 Retrospective
clinical series) were identified. Characteristics of the selected studies are described in Table 1. Two full texts
of included articles are in Chinese [26,38] and the others are in English. All articles reported SARS-CoV-2
positive pregnant women from China except six case reports from Republic of Korea (1) [39], Sweden (1) [41],
United States (2) [44,45], Central America (1) [42] , and Switzerland (1) [46]. A total of 287 pregnant women
with COVID-19 were identified.

Maternal characteristics
Mean maternal age ranged from 22 to 41 years of age. Most pregnant women reported in their third trimester.
Eleven pregnant women (3.8 %) were in their second trimester and there was no data on first-trimester COVID19 infection. All pregnancies were singleton except 5 twin cases. Forty-two pregnancies (15%) were ongoing
including seven women (2.5%) in second trimester, ten women (3.6%) in third trimester, and trimester of
twenty-five women (8.9%) was not mentioned. All these women were discharged without any major
complications. The outcomes of these pregnancies are not known.
Sixty-seven pregnant women (23.9%) had co-morbidities or complications in their pregnancies. Gestational
diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia were the most common complications in these
pregnancies. At the time of admission, 102 (35.5%) and 34 (11.8%) cases were symptomatic and asymptomatic,
respectively. The status of symptoms at the time of admission was not mentioned in 152 of 287 cases. Fever
was a common onset symptom in pregnant women with COVID-19 (51.5%), although onset symptoms were not
mentioned in 22 cases. Lymphocytopenia was a common abnormal laboratory finding which was reported in 91
of 134 cases (67.9%) where the information was recorded. Multiple ground-glass opacities were the most
common pattern visible in chest computed tomography (CT) (201 of 256 available cases).

Maternal outcomes
There is currently no data about first trimester miscarriage affected women with COVID-19 infection because
all pregnant women were in second and third trimester of their pregnancies. In terms of second or third-trimester
pregnancy loss, there was only one stillbirth in a woman at 34 weeks gestational age with a fever and sore throat
whose condition deteriorated during hospitalization, she was transferred to ICU and required Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [27]. In addition, a
second-trimester miscarriage in a pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection was reported at 19 weeks
gestational age [46]. Forty-three women delivered preterm. 88.38% of these preterm deliveries were delivered
electively by cesarean section. Fetal intrauterine growth restriction post COVID-19 infection was not reported in
any studies because pregnant women delivered a short time after onset of illness and no data were available
regarding to fetal growth monitoring in ongoing pregnancies at the time of publication. Placental pathology in
three cases showed that lack of morphological changes was related to viral infection, no villitis or
chorioamnionitis , and negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test [38]. Although, positive RT-PCR test for SARSCov-2 of placental submembrane and cotyledon was reported in a pregnant woman with COVID-19 in second
trimester of her pregnancy [46]. 93% of all deliveries were done through cesarean section and vaginal delivery
was reported in 17 of 243 cases. According to the mentioned causes of cesarean section in 84 cases, COVID-19
infection was the most common indication for cesarean section in 44 of 84 cases (52.38%), and fetal distress
was ranked second with 13 of 84 cases (15.47%). From the papers that provided information about fetal
condition assessment (118 cases), fetal distress was reported in 20 cases (16.9%) and fetal condition in 94 cases
(79.6%) was reported normal. From all pregnant women with COVID-19, 156 cases received oxygen support
through a nasal cannula and mask and 5 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4 women
required intubation and mechanical ventilation. No maternal death was reported to date.

Neonatal outcomes
Neonatal asphyxia was reported in 7 of 232 cases (3%). A male newborn death was reported on the 9th day after
birth [30]. His mother developed thrombocytopenia complicated with abnormal liver function. He born at 34
weeks and 5 days gestational age with an Apgar score of 8 at five minutes and admitted to NICU due to

shortness of breath and moaning. On the 8th day after birth, his condition deteriorated due to refractory shock,
multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Result of his throat swab for 2019nCoV nucleic acid testing was negative on 9th day after delivery. According to the mentioned newborn feeding
in 60 cases, all newborns of mothers with COVID-19 were given formula instead of breast milk. Vertical
transmission of COVID-19 from mother to the fetus was not reported in available literature. However,
possibility of mother-to-child vertical transmission was suggested in three cases [23,29,35]. The first one was a
newborn with elevated IgM level, cytokines, and white blood cell count, normal chest CT, and negative RTPCR tests on nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 2 h to 16 days of age [23]. The second one was a neonate with
positive nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 at 36 h after birth, mild shortness of breath symptoms, mild
pulmonary infection in chest X-ray and no fever and cough. The neonate was discharged after 2 weeks
following two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results [29]. The third one was a neonate with positive RTPCR test for SARS-Cov-2, pulmonary infection in chest X-ray 53 h after birth, and no clinical manifestations of
Covid-19. The neonate was discharged after subsequent negative RT-PCR of throat swabs on 16th day after birth
[35]. Additionally, two newborns were reported with elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies, negative RT-PCR
test results of neonatal throat swabs, and no Covid-19 infection symptoms [45].

4. Discussion
After the first COVID-19 pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019,
and the ongoing outbreak across the world [1], some reports in pregnant women with COVID-19 infection have
been identified. This article summarizes available information from 287 pregnant cases with COVID-19.
Studies showed that SARS infection was associated with 1st trimester spontaneous abortion, fetal growth
restriction due to fibrin deposition, and a high case fatality rate (CFR) of 25% in pregnant women [47,48]. A
case-control study done in Hong Kong reported that ICU admission rate and CFR in the pregnant group were
higher than non-pregnant group and were 60% and 40% respectively [49]. Limited data exists on the outcome of
MERS on pregnancy, however, available information showed that CFR of infected pregnant women was 27%
and ICU admission was 64% [4, 50-54]. Our review of 287 pregnant women with COVID-19 showed no
maternal mortality and ICU admission was reported in 5 of 161 cases (3%).
Studies showed that the decision for cesarean section in SARS and MERS affected pregnant women was made
due to maternal hypoxemia, fetal distress, and some obstetrical indications such as placenta previa [4,51,55,56].
In this review, the majority of deliveries were done through cesarean section and 6.9% of pregnant women
delivered by vaginal delivery. More than half of mentioned causes of cesarean section were COVID-19
infection and 15.4% of deliveries were done through cesarean section due to fetal distress. One important issue
was that in most women who delivered by cesarean section due to COVID-19 infection cause, maternal
condition did not deteriorate.
Vertical transmission from mother to child among pregnant women who were infected with SARS and MERS
were not identified [4,57-60]. According to this review, there is no evidence to prove intrauterine or
transplacental transmission of COVID-19 but possibility of mother-to-child vertical transmission was suggested
due to positive RT-PCR test for SARS-Cov-2 in two newborns [29,35], elevated SARS-Cov-2 IgM anitibodies
in three neonates alongside negative RT-PCR [23,45], and virological findings in placenta in one case [46]. But
some researchers stated that molecular tests based on nucleic acid amplification and detection are more reliable
than IgM test to diagnose infections due to false-positive and false negative results, along with cross-reactivity
and testing challenges of IgM assays [61].
Although no viral RNA was detected in breast milk of mothers infected with SARS and MERS who had been
tested by RT-PCR, breast feeding in these mothers was not advised [4,53,56]. Chinese expert consensus on the
perinatal and neonatal management for the prevention and control of Covid-19 infection states that mothers with

confirmed or who are suspected of Covid-19 should not feed their infants with breast milk. However, if the
suspected or diagnosed mother and her breast milk test is negative for Covid-19, infants should be fed with
breast milk [62]. Though COVID-19 has not been detected in breast milk samples in some studies
[20,22,23,25,31], all newborns of mothers with COVID-19 were not breastfed according to available
information. It seems that formula feeding could prevent neonates from the possible way of Covid-19 infection
transmission through close contact with confirmed or suspected mothers.
Lack of report of some variables related to maternal and neonatal outcomes in several studies is one of the
limitations of this review. The other one is low methodological quality of the studies which were included in this
review. Maternal and neonatal assessment of a large number of cases (287 cases), consideration of some
maternal and neonatal outcomes including cause of cesarean section, early maternal chest CT findings, fetal
condition, neonatal asphyxia, newborn feeding in all studies and no limitation on language of published articles
are strengths of the current review in comparison with three reviews that exist to date [63-66].

Conclusion
This review literature showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID19 in comparison with SARS and MERS infection in pregnancy. There is no evidence to prove vertical
transmission of COVID-19 but possibility of mother-to-child vertical transmission was suggested due to
positive test for SARS-Cov-2 in two neonates and one placental infection with SARS-Cov-2. Possibility of
transmission during vaginal delivery is unknown due to small number of cases who delivered by vaginal
delivery. Because of not reporting breastfeeding, risk of transmission during breast feeding is unknown if breast
milk test of suspected or diagnosed mother with Covid-19 is negative.
