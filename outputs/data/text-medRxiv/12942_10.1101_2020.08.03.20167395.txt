Summary

28

Background There currently is substantial controversy about the role played by SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols

29

in disease transmission, due in part to detections of viral RNA but failures to isolate viable virus from

30

clinically generated aerosols.

31

Methods Air samples were collected in the room of two COVID-19 patients, one of whom had an active

32

respiratory infection with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. By using

33

VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water-vapor condensation principle, material was collected

34

from room air and subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected

35

from the air and of virus isolated in cell culture from air sampling and from a NP swab from a newly

36

admitted patient in the room were sequenced.

37

Findings Viable virus was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8m away from the patients. The

38

genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was

39

identical to that isolated from the NP swab from the patient with an active infection. Estimates of viable

40

viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air.

41

Interpretation Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of

42

aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source

43

of transmission of the virus.

Research in context

54

Evidence before this study

55

Various studies report detection of SARS-CoV-2 in material collected by air samplers positioned in

56

clinics and in some public spaces. For those studies, detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been by indirect

57

means; instead of virus isolation, the presence of the virus in material collected by air samplers has been

58

through RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, questions have been raised about the clinical

59

significance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, particularly as airborne viruses are often inactivated by

60

exposure to UV light, drying, and other environmental conditions, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 cannot

61

cause COVID-19.

62

Added value of this study

63

Our virus isolation work provides direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols can be viable and thus

64

pose a risk for transmission of the virus. Furthermore, we show a clear progression of virus-induced

65

cytopathic effects in cell culture, and demonstrate that the recovered virus can be serially propagated.

66

Moreover, we demonstrate an essential link: the viruses we isolated in material collected in four air

67

sampling runs and the virus in a newly admitted symptomatic patient in the room were identical. These

68

findings strengthen the notion that airborne transmission of viable SARS-CoV-2 is likely and plays a

69

critical role in the spread of COVID-19.

70

Implications of all the available evidence

71

Scientific information on the mode of transmission should guide best practices Current best practices for

72

limiting the spread of COVID-19. Transmission secondary to aerosols, without the need for an aerosol-

73

generating procedure, especially in closed spaces and gatherings, has been epidemiologically linked to

74

exposures and outbreaks. For aerosol-based transmission, measures such as physical distancing by 6 feet

75

would not be helpful in an indoor setting and would provide a false-sense of security. With the current

76

surges of cases, to help stem the COVID-19 pandemic, clear guidance on control measures against SARS-

77

CoV-2 aerosols are needed.

Introduction

80

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus

81

Sarbecovirus, family Coronaviridae, is a positive-polarity single-stranded RNA virus that probably

82

originated in bats1–3 and is the causative agent of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).4 The

83

dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic have proven to be complex. Many challenges remain pertaining to

84

a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathology, and transmission of COVID-19. For example, the

85

clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from an asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory illness to

86

pneumonia, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and death.5-7 Diarrhea due to gastro-intestinal

87

infection can also occur, and in vitro modeling suggests that the virus infects human gut enterocytes.8

88

SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in rectal swabs and fecal aerosols, even after nasal-pharyngeal testing

89

has turned negative,9-12 suggesting that a fecal–oral transmission route may be possible.

90

To-date, there has been a strong emphasis on the role of respiratory droplets and fomites in the

91

transmission of SARS-CoV-2.13,14 Yet SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to be exclusively inhaled as a

92

droplet, and epidemiologic data are consistent with aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.15-19

93

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA has been detected in airborne material collected by air

94

samplers positioned distal to COVID-19 patients.9, 20-23 Any respiratory virus that can survive

95

aerosolization poses an inhalation biohazard risk, and van Doremalen et al.24 experimentally generated

96

aerosol particles with SARS-CoV-2 and found that the virus remained viable during a three-hour testing

97

period. More recently, Fears et al.25 reported that the virus retained infectivity and integrity for up to 16

98

hours in laboratory-created respirable-sized aerosols. Nevertheless, finding virus RNA in material

99

collected by an air sampler may not correlate with risk. Indeed, the air we breathe is full of viruses

100

(animal, plant, bacterial, human, etc.), yet a large proportion of the viruses in air are non-viable due to

101

UV-inactivation, drying, etc., and non-viable viruses cannot cause illnesses. Because efforts to isolate

102

virus in cell cultures in the aforementioned air sampling studies in hospital wards were not made,20,22 or

103

failed when they were attempted due to overgrowth by faster replicating respiratory viruses,23 or provided

104

weak evidence of virus isolation,21 uncertainties about the role of aerosols in COVID-19 transmission

105

remain.

106

It is well known that virus particles collected by various air samplers become inactivated during the air

107

sampling process,26 and if such is the case for SARS-CoV-2, this partly explains why it has been difficult

108

to prove that SARS-CoV-2 collected from aerosols is viable. Because we previously collected SARS-

109

CoV-2 from the air of a respiratory illness ward within a clinic but were unable to isolate the virus in cell

110

cultures due to out-competition by other respiratory viruses,23 we sought to perform air sampling tests in a

111

hospital room reserved for COVID-19 patients, to lessen the probability of collecting other airborne

112

human respiratory viruses. We thus collected aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in a room housing

113

COVID-19 patients using our VIVAS air samplers that collect virus particles without damaging them,

114

thus conserving their viability. These samplers operate using a water-vapor condensation mechanism.27,28

115

Air samplings were performed at the University of Florida Health (UF Health) Shands Hospital, which is

116

a 1,050-bed teaching hospital situated in Gainesville, Florida. As of 10 July 2020, > 200 patients have

117

been treated at the hospital for COVID-19. The current study was conducted as part of ongoing

118

environmental investigations by the UF Health infection control group to assess possible healthcare

119

worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Detailed methods are provided in a Technical Appendix. An abbreviated summary of methods is

123

provided below:

124

Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and patients

125

The study protocol was approved by the UF IRB (study IRB202002102). Patient 1 was a person with

126

coronary artery disease and other co-morbidities who had been transferred from a long-term care facility

127

for COVID-19 treatment the evening before our air sampling tests were initiated; he had a positive NP

128

swab test on admission that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Patient 2 had been admitted four

129

days before the air sampling tests with a mid-brain stroke; the patient had a positive NP swab test for

130

SARS-CoV-2 on admission, but a repeat test was negative, and the patient was in the process of being

131

discharged at the time the air sampling was being done.

132

Hospital room

133

Air samples were collected in a room that was part of a designated COVID-19 ward (Figure 1). The room

134

had six air changes per hour and the exhaust air underwent triple filter treatment (minimum efficiency

135

reporting value [MERV] 14, 75%-85% efficiency for 0.3 µm particles), coil condensation (to remove

136

moisture), and UV-C irradiation prior to recycling 90% of the treated air back to the room.

137

Air samplers and sampling parameters

138

Three serial 3-hr air samplings were performed using our prototype VIVAS air sampler,23, 27, 28 as well as

139

a BioSpot-VIVAS BSS300P, which is a commercial version of the VIVAS (available from Aerosol

140

Devices Inc., Ft. Collins, CO). These samplers collect airborne particles using a water-vapor

141

condensation method.23, 27, 28 Two samplers were used so that air could be collected/sampled at different

142

sites of the same room during a given air sampling period. For each sampler, the second of the three

143

samplings was performed with a high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter affixed to the inlet

144

tube, a process we implement to reveal whether virus detected in consecutive samplings reflect true

145

collection and not detection of residual virus within the collector. The air-samplers were stationed from 2

146

to 4.8 m away from the patients (Figure 1).

147

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (vRNA) in collection media

148

vRNA was extracted from virions in collection media and purified by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini

149

Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Twenty-five µ L (final volume) real-time reverse-transcription

150

polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) tests were performed in a BioRad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR

151

Detection System using 5 µL of purified vRNA and rtRT-PCR primers and the probe listed in Table 1

152

that detect a section of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene.23 The N-gene rRT-PCR assay that was used was part of

153

a dual (N- and RdRp-gene) rRT-PCR assay designed by J. Lednicky and does not detect common human

154

alpha- or beta-coronaviruses. Using this particular N-gene rRT-PCR detection system, the limit of

155

detection is about 1.5 SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents per 25 µL rRT-PCR assay.

156

Cell lines for virus isolation

157

Cell lines used for the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture

158

Collection (ATCC) and consisted of LLC-MK2 (Rhesus monkey kidney cells, catalog no. ATCC CCL-7)

159

and Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells, catalog no. ATCC CRL-1586).

160

Isolation of virus in cultured cells

161

Cells grown as monolayers in a T-25 flask (growing surface 25 cm2) were inoculated when they were at

162

80% of confluency. First, aliquots (100 µL) of the concentrated air sampler collection media were filtered

163

through a sterile 0.45 µm pore-size PVDV syringe-tip filter to remove bacterial and fungal cells and

164

spores. Next, the spent LLC-MK2 and Vero E6 cell culture medium was removed and replaced with 1 mL

165

of cell culture medium, and the cells inoculated with 50 μL of cell filtrate. When virus-induced cytopathic

166

effects (CPE) were evident, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by rRT-PCR.

167

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in sampled air

168

The number of viral genome equivalents present in each sample was estimated from the measured

169

quantification cycle (Cq) values. To do so, a 6-log standard curve was run using 10-fold dilutions of a

170

calibrated plasmid containing an insert of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene that had been obtained from IDT

171

Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, Iowa). The data was fit using equation (eq.) 1:

172

Eq. 1. y = (log10GE)(a) + b, where y = Cq value, a = slope of the regression line, log10GE is the base

173

10 log genome equivalents, and b is the intercept of the regression line.

174

Sanger sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in material collected by air samplers

175

To obtain the virus consensus sequence prior to possible changes that might occur during isolation of the

176

virus in cell cultures, a direct sequencing approach was used. Because the amount of virus present in the

177

samples was low and thus unsuitable for common next-generation sequencing approaches, Sanger

178

sequencing based on a gene-walking approach with over-lapping primers was used to obtain the virus

179

sequence.23

181

The vRNA extracted from virions in spent Vero E6 cell culture medium served as a template to generate a

182

cDNA library using a NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Sequencing

183

was performed on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer using a 600-cycle v3 MiSeq Reagent kit. Following the

184

removal of host sequences (Chlorocebus sabaeus; GenBank assembly accession number

185

GCA_000409795.2) using Kraken 2,29 de novo assembly of paired-end reads was performed in SPAdes

186

v3.13.0 with default parameters.30

187

Results

188

SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (vRNA) was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative

189

polymerase chain reaction (rRT-qPCR) in material collected by air samplings 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, and 2-3,

190

which had been performed without a HEPA filter covering the inlet tube. In contrast, in the presence of a

191

HEPA filter, no SARS-CoV-2 genomes were detected in air samplings 1-2 and 2-2 (Table 1).

192

Virus-induced CPE were observed in LLC-MK2 and Vero E6 cells inoculated with material extruded

193

from the NP specimen of patient 1 and from liquid collection media from air samples 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, and 2-

194

3. Early CPE in both LLC-MK2 and Vero E6 cells consisted of the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles

195

that were apparent within 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) of the cells with material extruded from the NP

196

swab and 4 to 6 dpi with aliquots of the liquid collection media from the air samplers. At later times (4

197

days onwards after inoculation of cell cultures with material from the NP swab, and 6 – 11 dpi of the cells

198

with material collected by air samplers), rounding of the cells occurred in foci, followed by detachment of

199

the cells from the growing surface. Some of the rounded cells detached in clumps, and occasional small

200

syncytia with 3 -5 nuclei were observed. Apoptotic and necrotic cells were also observed. A

201

representative collage showing the progressive development of CPE in Vero E6 cells inoculated with

202

material collected during air sampling 1-1 is shown in Figure 2. Cytopathic effects were not observed and

203

virus was not detected or isolated from the culture medium of samples 1-2 and 2-2, wherein HEPA filters

204

had been affixed to the inlet nozzles of the air samplers, and were not observed in mock-inoculated cells

205

which were maintained in parallel with the inoculated cell cultures.

206

SARS-CoV-2-specific rRT-PCR tests were performed and the results indicated that the LLC-MK2 and

207

Vero E6 cultures inoculated with collection media from air samplings 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, and 2-3 contained

208

SARS-CoV-2 (data not shown). No other respiratory virus was identified in the samples using a BioFire

209

FilmArray Respiratory 2 Panel (BioMérieux Inc., Durham, North Carolina), following the manufacturer’s

210

instructions.

211

Whereas the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents per liter of air were estimated (Table

212

2), determination of the specific infectivity (ratio of SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents present for every

213

one able to infect a cell in culture) required performance of a plaque assay or a standard 50% endpoint

214

dilution assay (TCID50 assay). Plaque assays could not be performed due to a nationwide non-availability

215

of some critical media components (due to COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary lockdown of

216

production facilities), so TCID50 assays were performed in Vero E6 cells to estimate the percentage of the

217

collected virus particles that were viable. Estimates ranged from 2 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air (Table 3).

218

A nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was obtained by next-generation sequencing (NGS)

219

of RNA purified from cell culture medium of Vero E6 cells 7 dpi with NP swab material from patient 1.

220

The nearly complete genome sequence (and the virus isolate) were designated SARS-CoV-2/human/UF-

221

19/2020, and this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. MT668716) and in

222

GISAID (accession no. EPI_ISL_480349). Because the amount of virus RNA was below the threshold

223

that could be easily sequenced by our NGS methods, Sanger sequencing was used to sequence SARS-

224

CoV-2 RNA purified from the collection media of air samplers 1-1, 1-3, 2-1, and 2-3. One complete

225

SARS-CoV-2 sequence was attained for RNA purified in the material collected by air sampling 1-1, and

226

three nearly complete sequences for 1-3, 2-1, and 2-3, respectively. After alignment, comparisons of the

227

three partial sequences with the complete sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in air sampling 1-1 indicated that the

228

same consensus genome sequence were present in the virions that had been collected in all the air

229

samplings. Moreover, they were an exact match with the corresponding sequences of the virus isolated

230

from patient 1. This complete genome sequence of the virus collected by the air samplers (and the virus

231

therein) were considered the same isolate and designated SARS-CoV-2/Environment/UF-20/2020, and

232

this genome sequence has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. MT670008) and in GISAID

233

(accession no. EPI_ISL_477163). The virus’ genomic sequence currently falls within GISAID clade

234

B.1(GH), which is characterized by mutations C241T, C3037T, A23403G, G25563T, S-D614G, and

235

NS3-Q57H relative to reference genome WIV04 (GenBank accession no. MN996528.1). As of 10 July

236

2020, SARS-CoV-2 clade B.1(GH) was the predominant virus lineage in circulation in the USA.

237
238

Discussion

239

There are substantial epidemiologic data supporting the concept that SARS-CoV, which is highly related

240

to SARS-CoV-2,3 was transmitted via an aerosol route.31-33 For SARS-CoV-2, there have also been two

241

epidemiologic reports consistent with aerosol transmission.15,34 However, despite these reports,

242

uncertainties remain about the relative importance of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, given that so

243

far, only one study has provided weak evidence of virus isolation from material collected by air

244

samplers.21 In other reports, attempts to isolate the virus were not successful. The current study takes

245

advantage of a newer air sampling technology that operates using a water-vapor condensation mechanism,

246

facilitating the likelihood of isolating the virus in tissue culture.

247

As reported in air sampling tests performed by others9-11,21 and in our previous report,23 airborne

248

SARS-CoV-2 was present in a location with COVID-19 patients. The distance from the air-samplers to

249

the patients (≥ 2 m) suggests that the virus was present in aerosols. Unlike previous studies, we have

250

demonstrated the virus in aerosols can be viable, and this suggests that there is an inhalation risk for

251

acquiring COVID-19 within the vicinity of people who emit the virus through expirations including

252

coughs, sneezes, and speaking.

253

The amount of airborne virus detected per liter of air was small, and future studies should address (a)

254

whether this is typical for COVID-19, (b) if this represented virus production relative to the phase of

255

infection in the patient, (c) if this was a consequence of active air flow related to air exchanges within the

room, (d) or if the low number of virus was due to technical difficulties in removing small airborne

257

particles from the air.26

258

Our findings reveal that viable SARS-CoV-2 can be present in aerosols generated by a COVID-19

259

patient in a hospital room in the absence of an aerosol-generating procedure, and can thus serve as a

260

source for transmission of the virus in this setting. Moreover, the public health implications are broad,

261

especially as current best practices for limiting the spread of COVID-19 center on social distancing,

262

wearing of face-coverings while in proximity to others and hand-washing. For aerosol-based

263

transmission, measures such as physical distancing by 6 feet would not be helpful in an indoor setting,

264

provide a false-sense of security and lead to exposures and outbreaks. With the current surges of cases, to

265

help stem the COVID-19 pandemic, clear guidance on control measures against SARS-CoV-2 aerosols

266

are needed, as recently voiced by other scientists.35
