ABSTRACT (275 words)
Background: Data suggest that COVID-19 transmission in K-12 schools is uncommon, but few studies
have confirmed this using widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals.
Objective: To evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19, document the frequency of in-school
transmission, and confirm feasibility of widespread asymptomatic screening in schools.
Design: Prospective observational study
Setting: Single mid-sized suburban school district including 10 schools and a central office.
Participants: District staff and students
Interventions: Asymptomatic screening PCR for SARS-CoV-2
Measurements: Concurrent with a hybrid model and layered mitigation, weekly pooled testing of staff
and secondary students was offered using saliva samples collected at home. Identification of >1 case in a
school prompted investigation for possible in-school transmission. Staff and families were surveyed
about satisfaction with the screening program.
Results: From weeks 1-18, rates of incident COVID-19 in the surrounding community rose
steadily. Weekly staff and student screening identified 0-7 asymptomatic cases/week. In week 7, 5
cases were identified among staff who shared an office setting. Enhancements to mitigation strategies
were undertaken. The proportion of survey respondents self-reporting comfort with in-person learning
before versus after implementation of screening increased.
Limitations: Because screening testing was not mandatory, the results from the participating population
might not represent the entire school community.
Conclusions: In this school district with layered mitigation measures, in-school transmission was rare.
The program identified a cluster with in-school staff-to-staff transmission and spurred enhancement of
safety strategies. A weekly COVID-19 screening program can provide critical data to inform mitigation

INTRODUCTION
The spring 2020 onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global transition to remote learning. Many US
schools persisted in this model in 2020-21: 49% of districts1 and 52% of students2 planned remote
education in September 2020, with higher rates of remote-only learning in communities of color.
Recognizing the challenges and inequities of remote learning, many schools offer in-person learning
with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including masking, distancing, ventilation upgrades, reduced
occupancy, and enhanced disinfection.3,4

Where community rates are high, it is expected that students and staff who enter school buildings will
unknowingly be infected with COVID-19. A central question is whether they will transmit to others in the
school setting. Many countries have kept schools open for in-person learning despite rising community
COVID-19 incidence (often while restricting other sectors of society);5,6 data from both international and
US settings suggest that where mitigation strategies are well implemented, in-school transmission of
COVID-19 is rare.7–9 These findings are reassuring with regard to symptomatic and severe illness among
students and educators/staff. However, the lack of widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing of students and
faculty/staff without symptoms (“screening”) precludes these reports from assessing the true number of
in-school exposures that result in asymptomatic infection, possibly placing educator/staff and student
household members at risk.

Regular screening in K-12 schools may provide several benefits: information about in-school risk, a
snapshot of community COVID-19 prevalence, and an additional risk mitigation strategy (by identifying
and isolating people with COVID-19 before onward transmission occurs).10 The high cost of SARS-CoV-2
PCR testing, limited access to accurate rapid assays, and the challenges of sample collection and data
management in public-school settings have limited the uptake of screening programs, especially in

public-school districts with limited resources. We developed a consortium of 25 public-school districts to
implement and evaluate screening programs and collectively negotiate lower screening costs. We report
the results of a screening program in one well-resourced member district with the most mature
screening program. With the goal of ‘advocacy through action,’ our objectives were to describe barriers
and facilitators of K-12 public school screening; advocate for accurate, low-cost screening options; and
facilitate rollout of similar programs in schools across the state to improve equity and access to inperson learning.11

METHODS
This public-school district supports Pre-K to Grade 12 students in 1 preschool, 7 elementary schools
(grades K-5), 1 middle school (grades 6-8) and 1 high school (grades 9-12). In fall 2020, families were
offered the option to enroll students in a fully-remote curriculum (approximately 500 students) or a
hybrid-learning curriculum (approximately 4000 students). Schools opened to remote learning for all
students on September 16th. Hybrid learning began October 1, consisting of in-person learning 2 days
per week with remote learning 2.5 days per week; students with high learning needs attended in-person
4 days per week, along with all students in Grades K, 1, and later Grade 2. Safety measures were based
on the CDC and state Department of Public Health and Department of Education guidelines, and
included mandatory masking (except during lunch and designated mask breaks), frequent hand
sanitizing, 6 feet of distance separating students seated at their desks in most classrooms, ventilation
upgrades as feasible based on age of individual buildings, use of outdoor space when possible, enhanced
environmental disinfection, and daily symptom screening.12

Baseline individual SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening was offered to all staff and students prior to the opening
of hybrid learning, followed 1 month later by weekly pooled PCR screening for all staff as well as all
students in the middle and high schools. Participation in screening was not required but strongly
encouraged. Parents and guardians provided consent for student testing. Saliva collection packages
were assembled, labeled with unique barcodes, and distributed to staff and students at school.
Students or staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the previous 90 days were excluded from
participation that week. Saliva samples (1 ml volume) were collected at home, then returned to the
schools for shipping to a commercial laboratory. Screening was scheduled to interact with hybrid
learning schedules; students present on Monday/Thursday were screened on Mondays, enabling result-

return and contact tracing over 48 hours of remote learning, and students present Tuesday/Friday were
screened on Tuesdays.

Screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a pooled saliva PCR directed at two targets in the
nucleocapsid gene, N1 and N2 (Saliva Clear, New York State Department of Health-authorized, US FDA
emergency use authorization (EUA) pending). Samples failing to demonstrate DNA on quality testing
were not assayed. If a pool of 24 tests resulted as positive, pooled testing was repeated with
sequentially fewer individual samples, until positive results were isolated to a pool of 2. Those two
individuals were then contacted for consent to perform individual diagnostic testing (Saliva Direct PCR,
US FDA EUA), at which time US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)-required demographic
data were collected. No additional specimen was required to proceed to diagnostic testing. Students
and staff from positive pairs were instructed to isolate while awaiting diagnostic test results. Positive
diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 test results were reported directly to the staff and parents/guardians of students,
as well as local health officials and the district director of nursing.

Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined when an individual specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2
by follow-up diagnostic RT-PCR. Confirmed cases were further classified as symptomatic (symptom
onset before the first positive laboratory test), presymptomatic (first positive laboratory test before
subsequent symptom onset), or asymptomatic (positive laboratory test but clinical criteria never met).
All individuals with a positive test result were required to isolate per CDC and state Department of
Public Health (DPH) guidelines.13

Confirmed cases resulted in contact tracing performed by the health department linked to the address
of each infected individual (to identify community contacts, as resources allowed) and the school

nursing department (for in-school contacts), in accordance with DPH guidelines.13 In-school contact
tracing identified individuals with which the infected person spent at least 15 minutes within 6‘
(consecutive exposure through 10/21/20, cumulative exposure thereafter), regardless of masking.12 The
communicable period for which contact tracing was required began 2 days before symptom onset or, if
no symptoms ever developed, 2 days prior to the collection date of the positive test. Close contacts
were instructed to quarantine and seek testing according to state guidelines (14 days regardless of
testing through 12/2/20, with options for shorter quarantine periods following negative tests
thereafter).14

Throughout the screening program, educators/staff and students were regularly reminded to stay out of
school and seek outside diagnostic testing if they developed any symptoms consistent with COVID-19;
some also sought outside testing after exposures or travel.12 In the event that >1 case was identified in a
single school over a 2-week period, either through screening or outside testing for any reason, an
investigation was initiated to determine the presence or absence of in-school transmission. This
investigation included review for possible exposures in and outside of school and mapping of student
and educator/staff movement patterns and locations of staff workstations. Educators/staff and students
also answered detailed questions regarding location and duration of mask breaks, eating, and drinking;
shared objects and surfaces; and recall of any symptoms prior to detection of the cluster.

An online survey was sent to educators/staff and families/caregivers of students prior to the initiation of
the screening program and repeated at screening week 11.15 Domains included: level of comfort with inperson schooling without baseline testing, degree of reassurance about school safety after results of
baseline testing; change in comfort with in-person learning due to the screening program; and perceived

RESULTS
Identification of COVID-19 through the screening program
A total of 921 district staff were eligible for participation in the screening program, including 256 at the
high school and 258 at the middle school/central office. Most staff (87%) did not live in the town where
the school district is situated. Students eligible for screening included 1,403 at the high school and 1,000
at the middle school. Excluding holiday weeks (weeks 8, 9, 14) and school closures, participation in
screening varied ranged by week from 58-77% of eligible students and 73-83% of eligible staff. Common
reasons for failure to submit a sample included absence from school on the day of kit distribution or
collection or forgotten samples. The turnaround time from receipt of samples to results of a negative
pool was approximately 48 hours; time from consent to perform diagnostic testing to verification of
diagnostic results was 2-4 hours.

During the screening program period, rates of incident COVID-19 in the district’s municipality rose
steadily from 5 to 32/100,000/day (Table 1). From weeks 1 to 18 , 126 COVID-19 cases were identified
among faculty/staff and students who were enrolled in any in-person learning model (Figure 1). Of these
126 cases, 37 were identified through the screening program, and 89 were identified through outside
tests.

In week 6, screening identified 1 positive staff member in the high school main office. Three additional
main office staff members were identified as close contacts; all sought individual testing during
quarantine and tested positive. In week 7, 4 additional main office staff members not identified as close
contacts had positive results from the weekly screening, as well as 1 staff member not based in the main
office and 2 high school students. Based on these results, the high school was transitioned to remote
learning for a period of 3 weeks, to allow for full investigation. Possible risk factors for transmission and

opportunities for reinforcement of existing protocols were identified in three categories. First, review of
heating, ventilation, and air conditioner (HVAC) systems, including assessment of airflow in the main
office using smoke, suggested airflow impedance in the main office area attributed to plexiglass dividers
with sidewalls; these structures were rearranged. Second, location mapping and staff interviews
highlighted occasions of mask removal at distances <6’, primarily for eating and drinking; additional
spaces for unmasking and eating/drinking were provided. Third, high-traffic areas (especially in two-way
entry/egress areas) and shared offices were identified; one-way traffic flow and schedules for single
office occupancy were established. Because no additional cases were identified in screening among staff
at other schools, or among middle school students, all other schools in the district continued hybrid or
in-person learning.

Identification of COVID-19 outside the screening program
In week 9, 3 cases were identified in one elementary school classroom, all through outside testing of
close contacts. After evaluation by school and board of health officials, transmission was thought to
have occurred outside of school. This single class moved to remote learning for 10 calendar days
(including a professional development day, thus missing one full school week). Screening at the middle
and high school and among elementary staff revealed few additional cases, and in-person learning
continued at other sites. In week 15 (post-holiday), 9 students with SARS-CoV-2 were identified at the
high school: 5 via the screening program and 4 via outside testing. The high school transitioned to
remote learning for 10 calendar days (including 2 weekends, thus missing one full school week), and inperson learning remained in place at other schools.

Implementation and acceptability
Survey responses were received from 491 educators/staff and 658 families/caregivers (78% with at least
one student at middle or high school levels, 22% with students only in preK-5), a response rate of 53%
(educators/staff) and 12-24% (families/caregivers, assuming 1-2 responses per family). Prior to baseline
testing, the proportion of educators/staff who reported feeling “mostly comfortable” or “very
comfortable” was 12%; after baseline testing, 82% reported feeling “reassured” or “very reassured”
(Table 2). Among families/caregivers, these proportions were 39% and 87%.

Perceived benefits of the screening program for families/caregivers included outbreak prevention (91%),
increased opportunity for in-person learning (88%), increased safety for educators/staff and their
families (80%) and for students and their families (80%), and a reminder to follow safety protocols
(46%). Perceived detriments of the screening program for families/caregivers included cost (35%), false
sense of security (30%), stigma (6%), privacy (5%), burden to collect samples (4%), impact on family if
student tests positive (4%), and impact of teachers needing to quarantine (4%); 47% reported no
perceived detriments.

Assay costs averaged $10/individual screened/week, including both pooled screening and follow-up
individual diagnostic testing. Community fundraising supported the monetary costs of the pilot
screening program. Staff and volunteers from across the district participated in implementation and
operation of the screening program. Community education and outreach via webinars, website
information, and weekly messaging for all stakeholders (educators, staff, families, caregivers, students,
and local public health agencies) was crucial for the success of the program. The district technology
department developed and maintained a Google™ site for registering barcodes for each student and
sample, requiring 4 hours for initial development and 1 hour/week for maintenance. Approximately 10

hours per week of parent volunteer time was needed to order and assemble saliva collection kits, apply
and track barcodes, collect and transport samples, and maintain data for billing. and review and address
results. Bus and van drivers, not driving on Wednesdays due to fully remote learning, spent a total of 54
hours/week assembling test kits; on testing days, they also collected samples at individual schools and
transported them to a central location for processing and shipping.

School nurses reinforced correct collection technique, sorted and prepared samples for shipping, and
maintained records of participation. Nurses spent an average of 4 hours per confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case
(range, 1-6 hours) to conduct contact tracing, provide education/support, and collaborate with the
health department. In addition, the Director of Nursing spent at least 20 hours per week on result
follow-up, management of positive cases, data entry, and program administration. Nursing,
administration, and parent volunteer staff also dedicated additional evening and weekend hours
consulting with other public-school districts implementing screening programs.

DISCUSSION
During the COVID-19 pandemic, preK-12 schools can offer safe in-person learning with infrequent inschool transmission, as long as mitigation measures are implemented uniformly.16,17 Weekly screening of
educators/staff and middle and high school students can successfully detect asymptomatic cases and inschool transmission events. Over 18 weeks, this screening program detected 37 of the 126 total positive
tests among students and staff engaged in in-person learning, and in-school transmission was rare.
These findings are consistent with data from Australia, the UK, Norway, Germany, and Italy,7–9,18,19 as
well as emerging data from K-12 schools across the US.10,16,17,20–22 However, rare in-school transmissions
did occur associated with breaks in mitigation protocols, consistent with data from Israel, Utah, and
Mississippi.23–25 The information gained from the screening program was valuable not only in
understanding current prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the school community, but also in mitigating risk, by
identifying a small number of in-school transmissions before additional in-school transmission occurred,
and allowing investigation and improvement in potentially associated practices.

Although the risk for severe COVID-19 is relatively low in children, unrecognized or asymptomatic
infection in students places their household members at risk for infection.26,27 At the same time, there
are substantial non-COVID-19-related mental and physical health risks associated with lack of in-person
learning.3,28–31 Inequities that existed before the pandemic in education and health are exacerbated by
school closures, particularly in Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities and among children
experiencing housing and food insecurity.32,33 Educator health must also be a key priority; 25-50% of
educators have medical conditions or older age that place them at risk for COVID-19 complications, or
live with household members with a higher-risk condition.34,35 Moreover, teachers and other school staff
may have job-related risks that differ from other workplace settings, such as the need for close student
interactions over prolonged durations, and shared office space. Developing strategies to maintain

workplace safety for educators is critical for schools to operate during this pandemic. These results
highlight unique issues for educator safety that extend beyond the usually discussed in-classroom
mitigation strategies, including the need for well-ventilated, distanced places for eating and drinking, as
well as workspace with adequate distancing between staff. These findings are consistent with SARS-CoV2 outbreaks observed in other non-school low-risk settings, such as clusters of infection in hospital
employees linked to eating and drinking in shared breakrooms.36,37

Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in the preK-12 setting, by itself, cannot replace the other layers of protection
afforded by the mitigation strategies that have been shown to be effective, including masking, physical
distancing, hygiene, and ventilation. Screening can, however, provide an added layer of protection to
increase the safety of in-person schooling during the pandemic. Screening programs can detect
infections and prevent onward transmission, possibly avoiding larger clusters. Modeling suggests that
weekly screening may permit 5-day in-person education at the same total COVID-19 risk as 2-day hybrid
education without screening; this effect is larger in the setting of rising community rates.38,39

In addition, screening programs can provide data to inform responses to detected cases, e.g., allowing
targeted closing of specific classrooms, office spaces, or school buildings while the remaining facilities
continue in-person learning/work. In this district, based on global, state, and local experience combined
with the data from the screening program, the district dashboard and closure metrics were adapted
after the first semester to include these more relevant building-specific metrics, moving away from state
and county infection rates as triggers to consider district closure.40 Crucially, screening can also provide
assurance to faculty, staff, parents and students that mitigation measures are working to prevent spread
of infection within schools.

The resources required to implement weekly screening in public schools are substantial. This pilot
program cost more than $320,000 in assay costs alone over a period of 18 weeks and required at least
80 hours per week of staff and volunteer time to implement. Many private K-12 schools and universities
have been able to implement screening programs; public schools will need extensive state and federal
support for screening. While this project was a pilot designed to evaluate the feasibility of screening, it
was implemented successfully only because the town had extensive financial resources and availability
of private funds. Local, state, and national leaders must recognize that use of private funds is neither a
sustainable nor an equitable approach. The cost to implement weekly screening for all K-12 public
school students in the US has been estimated at $42.5 billion.41 The rapidly improving quality and
availability of SARS CoV-2 antigen tests may reduce costs in the future, but accuracy (both sensitivity
and specificity) of many of these tests remains lower than PCR.42 Use of antigen testing for screening
would require extensive governmental oversight and support, including the waiving of the FDA EUA
restriction around use for symptomatic people only, a plan for the follow-up of potentially false negative
and false positive results with readily available confirmatory testing, and liberalizing rules around
collection by non-licensed individuals.43

In addition to costs, the logistical challenges of screening in K-12 public schools must be addressed.
Important barriers include complex and time-consuming specimen labeling, collection, and transport;
notification of faculty/staff and parents of results; and transmission of results to health officials for
contact tracing and additional testing. The feasibility of this program was enhanced by the use of saliva
samples which were easy to collect at home and the lack of requirement to provide multiple HHSrequired data elements for diagnostic testing. The in-laboratory transition from screening testing to
diagnostic testing after identification of a positive pair of samples, without the need for an additional
specimen, minimized unnecessary isolation of uninfected students and staff.

Participation in screening in most public-school settings is voluntary. Education and outreach to
maximize participation will permit the greatest benefit and return on investment for screening
programs. Resources describing barriers and facilitators to participation should be publicly shared by
districts with successful screening programs.44,45 Although these challenges are substantial, they are not
impossible to overcome, and are critically needed to protect students, educators, school staff, and the
wider communities in which schools operate. Vaccination is anticipated for educators/staff by mid-2021,
but students, especially those younger than 12, are likely to remain unvaccinated for some time. The
role for screening programs in protecting student and educator/staff health, as well as in providing data
and reassurance, is anticipated to persist.

As anticipated for many public-school districts implementing screening, our results are limited to a
single town. In addition, because screening testing was not mandatory, the results from the participating
population might not represent the entire school community.

In summary, schools provide an essential function in society, yet they present distinct challenges to
operate safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Screening programs can detect the presence of
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in schools and, when applied alongside other proven mitigation strategies,
allow public schools to continue to operate safely despite rising community rates. Local, state, and
federal coordination and support for screening programs will be essential to ensure that all children are
provided an equal opportunity for public education and that educators are ensured of workplace safety.
