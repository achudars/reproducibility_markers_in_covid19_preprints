Distance to Epicenter and Mental Health

Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the
typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions

Aim:
Although some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with
negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of
COVID-19 on people’s mental health is still nascent. This study uses typhoon eye theory to
offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during
COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods:
We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on
20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308
working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of
Wuhan.
Results:
Individual adults’ distance to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction (β
= -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life
satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For
example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket
of 20 years old (15.7%; β = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; β
= -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001).
Conclusion:
Our results that people’s well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for
specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are
further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, our results

Distance to Epicenter and Mental Health

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 virus is deteriorating people’s wellbeing, as shown in an increase in the
burnout or anxiety across communities.1 2 However, our knowledge of people’s life
satisfaction, one of the most prominent indicators of mental health, 3 4 during COVID-19
crisis remains a lacuna. We aim to use early evidence in China to help mental health services
providers in screening people with wellbeing issues during COVID-19 outbreak from a novel
perspective of typhoon eye theory.5 6 This study identifies the vulnerable regions where
individuals are more likely to suffer from well-being issues and helps to guide medical
professionals’ attention towards the more mentally vulnerable groups that are far away from
the epicenter in the COVID-19 outbreak.
Mental health services used to pay more attention to people around the center of the
epicenter following the “ripple effect” during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Ebola 7-9. However, given the explosive information on COVID-19,10 we suspect that
individuals’ well-being deteriorates over distance from the epicenter, as depicted by the
psychological typhoon eye theory.5 6 To provide evidence on the geographical distribution of
the wellbeing issues during COVID-19 crisis, we test whether typhoon eye theory works and
for whom it works in the COVID-19 outbreak.
To further help clinical psychiatrists in conducting clinical screening for the
vulnerable groups of people during the pandemic of COVID-19, we examine whether the
typhoon eye effect is more or less useful based on people’s age and family size. The younger
population are usually more adaptive to the outbreak of virus or a natural disaster,11 12
however, they also tend to access information on COVID-19 more frequently via social
media and other digital channels13 and hence are more exposed to the associated negative
content.14 In addition, family size is a salient indicator of social support that one could

receive.15 During the outbreak of a disease, family size has been found to become an
important resource to buffer stress and anxiety.16
We surveyed working adults in locations that vary in their travel distance from the
epicenter of Wuhan (0 to 2126 km) to examine its relationship with their life satisfaction.
Moreover, we have also identified the vulnerable groups of people (based on age and family
size), for whom the typhoon eye effect of COVID-19 is more pronounced. Overall, drawing
from psychological typhoon eye,5 6 this study provided a snapshot of adults’ well-being
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to enable more targeted mental health support.
METHODS
Study design
On December 29, 2019, the first four cases of COVID-19 were identified by the local
hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.17 Given the severity of COVID-19, the World
Health Organization made the decision on presenting the outbreak as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.18 A week prior to this
announcement, the Chinese authorities decided to shut down the city of Wuhan by ceasing all
the transportation means, including flights, trains, subway, and ferry services.19 Nevertheless,
around 300,000 people traveled out of Wuhan area by train before the policy was
implemented.20 About 70% of those people reached reach other areas within Hubei Province,
and about 14% went to the nearby provinces, such as Henan, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi.21
As people left the epicenter, it is susceptible that they carry fear and anxiety to people around
them due to the concerns about being infected by the virus.
Data collection and measures
From February 20 to 21, 2020, we sent a survey to 410 working adults staying in various
cities in China right after a month of the outbreak. 308 of them answered the survey, resulting

in a response rate of 75.1%. Their distance to the epicenter ranged from 0 km to 2126 km. All
respondents agreed to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee at
Tongji University (#20200211).
Our survey gathered subjects’ life satisfaction, distance to the epicenter, and sociodemographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, family size, the number of
office days last week, and job status. Life satisfaction was assessed with the Satisfaction With
Life Scale (SWLS),22 which has five items (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.72) shown in Table 1. The
distance to the epicenter was calculated as each participant’s distance to Wuhan at the time of
the survey. Education included the categories of “elementary school”, “middle school”, “high
school”, “vocational school”, “bachelor”, “master”, and “doctorate”. Family size was
measured as “single”, “married (without a child)”, “married (with 1 child)”, “married (with
more than 1 child)”, and “others: divorced/widowed”. Job status was classified as “usual
work routine”, “home office”, and “work suspended”.
We have also conducted a supplementary analysis on the relationship between the
distance to the epicenter and life satisfaction from data collected prior to the outbreak of
COVID-19 to check whether the typhoon eye effect occurred only during the COVID-19
crisis.
We used multiple linear regression to predict life satisfaction as an outcome by
subjects’ gender, age, family size, education, number of working days last week, job status,
and distance to the epicenter. We reported the descriptive and regression findings on
unweighted data with STATA 16.0 by the statistical significance of p<0.05 in Table 2.
RESULTS
Around half 168 (54.5%) of the subjects were male, and 140 (45.5%) were female. The
average distance to the epicenter of Wuhan was 0.81 (in 1000 km) with a standard deviation
of 0.41 (in 1000 km). The average age of the subjects was 38 (s.d.= 9). For family size, most

of them fell into the categories of single: 171 (32.3%), married with one child: 177 (33.5%),
and married with more than one child: 150 (28.4%). There were 119 (38.6%) people with
bachelor’s degrees and 129 (42%) with elementary, middle, high, and vocational school
education levels. During our survey, more than half of them (175, 56.8%) did not have any
office day in the past week and the rest worked on average for 1.67 (s.d. 2.34) days last week.
22 (7.1%) worked one day and 20 (6.5%) worked seven days in the past week. 132 (42.9%)
worked from home, while 99 (32.1%) maintained the usual work routine, and 77 (25%)
suspended their work.
Main Effects of the Personal Characteristics
The regression results in Table 2 examined the predictors of life satisfaction during the period
of the outbreak. Male (54.5%) reported a lower level of life satisfaction than women did
(45.5%) (β = 0.3, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.46, p < 0.001). Younger working adults experienced less
life satisfaction than older adults did (β = 0.013, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.024; p = 0.019). Single
people had less life satisfaction compared to those with one child (33.5%) and more than one
child (28.4%) (for one child: β = 0.401, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.679; p < 0.005; for more than one
children: β = 0.418, 95% CI 0.147 to 0.689; p = 0.003). The effects of education, the number
of office days last week, and job status on life satisfaction were not significant.
Effect of the Distance to the Epicenter of Wuhan
The regression results in Table 2 indicated the negative association between the distance to
the epicenter and life satisfaction (β = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020; p = 0.032),
supporting the typhoon eye effect.
First, the association between the distance to the epicenter and life satisfaction was
less negative among the older adults (β = 0.020, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.036; p = 0.015). The
association is the most negative in the youngest age bracket of 20 years old (β = -0.703; 95%

CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and the second most negative in the second youngest age
bracket of 30 years old (β = -0.475, 95% CI -0.748 to -0.202, p = 0.001), while the group of
40 years old were the third one (β = -0.247, 95% CI -0.460 to -0.034; p = 0.023). The
association was not significant for the age brackets of 50 years old and above. These
interaction effects are shown in Figure 1.
Second, the negative association between the distance to the epicenter and life
satisfaction was also buffered by large family size (β = 0.260, 95% CI 0.098 to 0.421; p =
0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed the typhoon eye effect was significant among the singles
(β = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001), those married without a child (2.8%; β = 0.507, 95% CI -.0750 to -0.265; p < 0.001), and those married with one child (33.5%; β = 0.248, 95% CI -0.451 to -0.044; p = 0.017). The association between the distance to the
epicenter and life satisfaction was not significant for those married with more than one child
(25.4%; β = 0.012, 95% CI -0.264 to 0.288; p = 0.932) or indicated others in family status
(3%; β = 0.272, 95% CI -0.132 to 0.675; p = 0.186). These interaction effects are
demonstrated in Figure 2.
Supplementary Analysis
We modeled the relationship between the distance to the epicenter and life satisfaction using
collected data from working adults before the outbreak of COVID-19. The effect of the
distance to the epicenter of Wuhan on life satisfaction was insignificant (β = 0.000, 95% CI 0.0003 to -0.0003, p = 0.897) before the outbreak. This supplementary analysis indicates that
the typhoon eye effect did not occur before the COVID-19 outbreak.
DISCUSSION
This study shows that people who were geographically further from the epicenter experience
lower levels of life satisfaction in China. Following psychological typhoon eye theory, we

further identify the vulnerable groups that mentally suffer the most associated with their
distance during the outbreak: younger adults and individuals with small family size to provide
important insights for mental health service providers while conducting the clinical screening.
In summary, our findings do not only provide psychiatric implications on the location of
individuals from the outbreak area but also combine this geographical result with the
demographic characteristics of participants to help identify the vulnerable groups who were
in greater need of medical attention.23
Indeed, our results empirically confirmed the postulation of the typhoon eye theory.5 6
Research from multiple disciplines of research can provide explanations of the findings. For
example, clinical studies found that people that did not experience the situation first-hand
often overestimated the likelihood of infections.24 People who learned the news about the
virus away from the epicenter tended to exacerbate their concerns over COVID-19.25
Similarly, research after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China found that people far from
the earthquake area were more likely to suffer mentally for their higher estimation of postearthquake concern.5 Understanding the life satisfaction of people with a varying
geographical distance to the epicenter is crucial for clinical psychiatrists during the process of
screening because the changes in its score are associated with the chance of suffering from
mental disorders like depression.26 27 By revealing that people who were more distant from
the epicenter indeed have lower life satisfaction scores, our results guide mental health
professionals to prioritize the treatment and habilitation for people based on their
geographical distance to the outbreak area.
The findings that the typhoon eye effect was more pronounced among younger are
consistent with prior research. As noted earlier, younger people tend to rely on social media
and the internet to obtain information.28 This reliance increases the likelihood of developing
the feelings of anxiety and burnout through inauthentic news about the epicenter. Younger

residents can be more vulnerable to negative information on COVID-19. The other finding
that the psychological typhoon eye effect is more salient for people with smaller family sizes
consonants with the family literature.29 Support from the family attenuates the negative
psychological impacts that one might experience facing disasters.30 Hence, we push forward
the claim that one’s family size is a proxy of the level of social and emotional support that
individuals may receive during the outbreak of COVID-19 31.
Practically, our findings combine geographical and demographic information of
participants to help identify the vulnerable groups who were in a greater need for mental
health attention. Our results suggest that mental health services cannot solely use typhoon eye
effect as the only geographical information to identify those with low life satisfaction. The
results that only people in the age brackets of 20-40 in regions far from the epicenter were
more likely to experience lower levels of life satisfaction indicate that mental healthcare
providers can indeed use typhoon eye effect only for people in those age brackets. This
guidance is especially notable giving research has already differentiated adults by age groups
regarding COVID-19 symptoms. Similarly, only adults with small family sizes in regions far
from the epicenter were more likely to experience lower levels of life satisfaction, and hence
mental healthcare providers can use typhoon eye effect to screen for mental health issues
among people with small families.
Limitations
The context of this study has a clear epicenter of COVID-19, Wuhan, in China. However, not
all countries have a single epicenter. For example, South Korea simultaneously had several
epicenters 32, which opened new research avenues on the effect of geographical distance in
the presence of multiple epicenters. In addition, the design was unable to capture the dynamic
movement of the citizens across the cities in China over time to observe the fluctuations in
the well-being over time. Lastly, our data was collected in China, a geographically large

country, and it remains unclear whether the typhoon eye effects will generalize in other
countries, most of which are smaller. The epicenter of Wuhan is in the center of the country,
yet an epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States of American is New York State, which is
geographically on the Northeastern. In that case, we suspect that the typhoon eye effects
might play out differently (i.e., at different pace and patterns).
Conclusion
Our research calls for clinical psychiatrists’ attention on people’s mental health during the
pandemic of COVID-19, especially for those who are living away from the epicenter. We
found that the further people are away from the epicenter, the lower are their reported life
satisfaction. This relationship is stronger among younger individuals and individuals with
smaller family sizes but not significant for older adults or those with bigger families. To
conclude, our research helps provide insights for clinical professionals in identifying the
vulnerable groups of people that are more exposed to the risk of mental disorder during the
pandemic of COVID-19.
