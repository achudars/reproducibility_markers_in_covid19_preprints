Abstract

25

Background and Objective

26

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an on-going epidemic with a multitude of long-ranging

27

effects on the physiological balance of the human body. It can cause several effects on thyroid

28

functions as well. We aimed to assess the lasting sequelae of COVID-19 on thyroid hormone and

29

the clinical course of the disease as a result.

30

Methods

31

Out of 76 patients, 48 patients of COVID-19 positive and 28 patients of COVID-19 negative

32

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were assessed for thyroid functions, IL-6, and Procalcitonin

33

between moderate, severe, and critical pneumonia on HRCT.

34

Results

35

Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 had thyroid abnormalities and higher IL-6

36

levels (76.10 ± 82.35 vs. 6.99 ± 3.99, 95% CI 52.18-100.01, P-value <0.01). Logistic regression

37

analysis suggested TT3 (P-value 0.01), IL-6 (P-value <0.01), and Procalcitonin (P-value 0.03) as

38

independent risk factors for COVID-19. ROC curve demonstrated IL-6 as the most sensitive

39

marker (P-value <0.01), and TT3, and Procalcitonin as the predictor for COVID-19 disease.

40

Conclusion

41

This pilot study from Pakistan demonstrates that changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be

42

important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Introduction

47

The on-going pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been found to have

48

multiple long-ranging effects on the normal physiological balance of the human body. Complex

49

and severe effects on human organ systems are being identified rapidly, including the

50

respiratory, gastric, circulatory, immune, renal, hepatic, cardiac, and hematological systems.

51

Literature on COVID-19 affecting human thyroid function is increasing gradually and the

52

understanding of thyroid dysfunction and its mechanism is growing. The expression of ACE2

53

combined with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRESS2) is the key cellular complex for

54

the virus to infect the human cells and interestingly both expression levels are present in the

55

thyroid gland, even more than the lungs.1

56

COVID-19 initiates an immune response over-activity leading to release of pro-

57

inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), which leads to overt thyroid

58

dysfunction by disruption of desiodases and thyroid transport proteins. Levels of T3 is inversely

59

proportional to IL-6 with a modest decrease of TSH and T4. This abnormality is described as

60

sick euthyroid syndrome.2,3 During the course of COVID-19 pneumonia, thyrotoxicosis may be

61

caused secondary to graves thyroiditis or subacute inflammatory thyroiditis. It can be

62

complicated by arrhythmias or thromboembolic episodes. Hence, abnormalities of thyroid

63

dysfunction are important to evaluate in COVID-19.4

64

We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients in our hospital

65

in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, compared with a matched cohort of non-COVID-19 patients. Our

66

objectives were to determine if COVID-19 caused acute and subacute thyroid abnormalities, as

67

determined by a diagnostic assessment of thyroid function, and whether thyroid dysfunction

68

leads to a more severe clinical course of COVID-19 in a South Asian population.

Materials and Methods

70

This retrospective study was approved by the ethical review board of Foundation

71

University (FFH/37/DCA/2020) following the World Medical Association Declaration of

72

Helsinki. Informed written consent was taken from all the participants. Patients were considered

73

for inclusion with positive high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for SARS-CoV-2.

74

HRCT was considered positive if it had consolidation, linear opacity, septal thickening, crazy-

75

paving pattern, or halo sign. Positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was labelled

76

group1 while negative PCR were labelled group 2.

77

The medical records of all the patients admitted at our institute from April 2020 to July

78

2020 with pneumonia were retrospectively examined. All records were accessed from October

79

2020. Patients with a history of thyroid disease, without assessment and follow-up of thyroid

80

functions, IL-6 and procalcitonin, pregnancy, and mild COVID-19 infections were excluded

81

from the study. A total of 76 patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-eight patients were

82

enrolled in group 1 and 28 in group 2. All patients had their tests on day one before initiation of

83

treatment and after three months’ follow-up. This group was screened for underlying thyroid

84

disease or any other medical history that can affect thyroid function.

85

All the cases were labeled as moderate, severe, or critical based on the clinical symptoms,

86

laboratory tests, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Moderate and severe cases were

87

classified as having pneumonia manifestations seen on imaging, respiratory rate of ≥ 30

88

breaths/min, and oxygen saturation ≤ 90% at rest. Critical cases were labeled as those requiring

89

mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, other organ failures that require intensive care

90

unit, and the presence of shock.

91

All patients included in the study had their thyroid functions, including thyroid-

92

stimulating hormone (TSH, reference range: 0.45 – 4.5 mIU/L), total triiodothyronine (TT3,

93

reference range: 70 to 200 ng/dL), serum total thyroxine (TT4, reference range: 4.6 – 11.2

94

mcg/dL) , procalcitonin (reference range: < 0.05 mcg/L), and IL-6 (reference range: 0 - 16.4

95

pg/mL) levels done via electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) in the Elecsys® 2010

96

immunoassay system. All the parameters were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19

97

and the control group. Any deviation from normal reference range was considered as thyroid

98

dysfunction.

99

Data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version

100

26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA.). Quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard

101

deviation (SD) and qualitative data in frequency and percentages. Both groups were compared

102

using the students’ t-test and Chi-square when feasible. A receiver operating characteristic

103

(ROC) curve was calculated for thyroid function tests and the acute phase reactants to find out

104

sensitivity and specificity of the lab parameters in COVID-19 pneumonia. Confidence interval

105

(CI) were presented for the lab parameters in all groups. A P-value of less than 0.05 was

106

considered significant.

Logistic regression was performed to determine how levels of thyroid functions and

140

phase reactants affect the risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. The model suggested TT3 (P-value

141

0.01), IL-6 (P-value <0.01), and Procalcitonin (P-value 0.03) as independent risk factors for

142

COVID-19. None of the patients received thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and the levels

143

of all the thyroid hormones returned to normal after recovery.

144

The stem and leaf plot was generated to demonstrate the distribution of the lab

145

parameters. The area under the ROC (AUC) for IL-6 and Procalcitonin was 0.941 (95% CI 0.89-

146

0.98, P-value <0.01) and 0.745 (95% CI 0.00-0.63, P-value <0.01), respectively. TT3 was a

147

predictor of COVID-19 pneumonia with AUC 0.283 (95% CI 0.15-0.40, P-value <0.01). Figure

Discussion

167

The results of our study showed that TSH was raised in moderately and critically affected

168

patients of COVID-19 as compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, TT3 levels were

169

raised significantly more at follow-up in COVID-19 patients than non-COVID-19 patients with

170

little to no discernable effect on TT4 levels. Our findings are in contrast to a similar retrospective

171

study from China, which found lower TSH levels in more severely affected patients of COVID-

172

19 and a study from Italy in which COVID-19 patients were found to have thyrotoxicosis after a

173

confirmatory diagnosis of COVID-19.5,6 Although all thyroid function tests returned close to

174

baseline at follow-up in both the Chinese and Italian studies, our study sample showed an outlier

175

in having raised TT3 levels across all three levels of severity of COVID-19. This is of great

176

concern, particularly when paired with the lasting damage to cardiac and respiratory systems

177

which has been documented with regards to COVID-19.7 Cardiac abnormalities secondary to

178

thyroid abnormalities may worsen when regarded in the context of post-infectious sequelae.

179

The thyroid gland is a major organ in maintaining many long term functions of the body,

180

in particular, cardiovascular, respiratory, and catabolic tasks, which is why many lower-income

181

countries have implemented salt iodination as a way to counter the consequences of iodine-

182

deficient thyroid disorders.8,9 As an emerging disease, COVID-19 has taken a devastating toll in

183

lower-middle-income countries, with seemingly no end in sight to the rising death toll which, at

184

the time of this writing, stands to cross more than 1, 000, 000.10 As the pandemic rages on, more

185

and more insights are emerging into not just the multi-systemic involvement of the virus, but its

186

impact on disrupting the endocrine system-- with more long-term effects-- can also no longer be

187

overlooked, particularly in the context of countries already struggling with prevalent endocrine

188

diseases.2

In Pakistan, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism is 5.1%

190

and 5.8%, respectively, and hypothyroidism is at 4.1%. Even though hyperthyroid conditions are

191

relatively rare in Pakistan.4 Our prevalence seems to be well above the prevalence of both

192

disorders in Europe (0.7%) and the United States (0.5%), while in our closest neighbor, India,

193

subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism were present in 1.6% and 1.3%, respectively and

194

hypothyroidism is comparable at 3.4%.9,11

195

Unlike other countries where COVID-19 has decimated population bases, Pakistan seems

196

to have emerged relatively unscathed from the pandemic.12 However, given the thyroid

197

abnormalities which have emerged in our study sample, it would seem that the long-term effects

198

of COVID-19, particularly with regards to follow-up of critically ill patients, may be overlooked

199

especially for elderly patients, in which the symptoms of excessive TT3 in circulation—body

200

aches, confusion, increased heart rate—may simply be dismissed as recovery from a viral

201

infection. Concurrently, a thyroid storm with raised inflammatory markers also has overlapping

202

signs and symptoms with the cytokine storm characteristic of COVID-19 worsening in critically

203

ill patients.8,13,14,15 Indeed, precedent for the effect of a previous coronavirus affecting the thyroid

204

was established by post-mortem studies of thyroid samples from patients infected with SARS

205

during the 2002 outbreak.16 This immunogenic and hormonal overlap of a novel disease may

206

further complicate the management and recovery of COVID-19, as corticosteroids used in the

207

treatment of severe COVID-19 may inadvertently cause auto-immune damage to the thyroid

208

gland.3,16

209

A study expressed a reduced TSH level in COVID-19 patients. It can be explained by two

210

hypotheses.17 One is direct follicular damage by SARS-COV-2. This was contradicted by

211

another study which proposed pituitary dysfunction instead of thyroid tissue destruction.18

However, there is a manifestation of thyroid dysfunction in critically ill patients, commonly

213

called sick euthyroid. There are multiple mechanisms contributing to this condition, including

214

alterations in TSH secretion, binding of thyroid hormone to transport proteins, and peripheral

215

uptake of thyroid hormone. This condition is a pathologic response to acute illness and treatment

216

with thyroid hormone imparts no benefit in sick euthyroid.19 At present, no study has

217

investigated effect of COVID-19 on sick euthyroid. Our study cohort demonstrated significantly

218

raised TSH and depressed TT3 levels in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to

219

non-COVID-19 pneumonia with corresponding severity. Therefore, it is our understanding that

220

COVID-19 affects thyroid functions and acute phase reactants irrespective of disease severity

221

when compared with similar non-COVID-19 patients and sick euthyroidism is not present in this

222

cohort.

223

This study had a number of limitations. One was a small cohort of consenting patients

224

and less duration of follow-up. Second was that free T3, free T4, and other pituitary hormones

225

were not assessed at admission and follow-up due to the retrospective nature of the study. Our

226

institute being a tertiary care, it received a higher than moderately severe COVID-19 cases.

227

Hence, patients with mild COVID-19 were not assessed for thyroid functions.

Conclusion

243

This retrospective study provides solid evidence of the high risk of altered thyroid

244

function after COVID-19 pneumonia. We believe our study represents an important direction of

245

exploration of the true cost of the disease, where the overt crises of COVID-19 may mask an

246

emerging crisis of long-term endocrine dysfunctions. Clinical vigilance must be practiced by

247

physicians when monitoring for recovery from COVID-19 for signs and symptoms of thyroid

248

hormone disruptions, particularly in patients of South Asian descent. Further prospective studies

249

will clarify the clinical and prognostic relevance of abnormal behavior of the thyroid gland with

250

COVID-19.
