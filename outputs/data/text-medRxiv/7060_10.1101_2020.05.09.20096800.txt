ABSTRACT
Objective: To estimate the incubation period of Vietnamese confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Methods: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with
available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2
exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method
for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leaveone-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models.
Results: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our
analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from
6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The
estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95%
credible interval (CrI): 4.89–8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CI 3.05–5.30), median
was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of
incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection.
Conclusion: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of
approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of
persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period
should be extended up to three weeks.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 caused by SAR-CoV-2 has been declared a global pandemic by WHO on March 11
2020 [1]. As a newly emerged disease, little have we known about the incubation period for
COVID-19, for which patients have no clinical symptom but some infected persons can be
contagious [2]. Understanding the distribution of incubation period is important to estimate the
potential spreading of the SARS-CoV-2, and to determine an optimal duration of quarantine.
The incubation period is identified by the interval time between exposure to source of an
infectious disease and the onset of the first clinical symptoms. As the incubation period is
known, we would be able to model the current and future of the pandemic scale, and to evaluate
the effectiveness of intervention strategies, therefore, would be able to act swiftly several
intensive public health strategies for infectious diseases [3].
Since the first COVID-19 case found in Vietnam on 23 January 2020, as of 13 April 2020, there
are 265 confirmed cases all over the country. Of those, two-thirds of the patients have
recovered, and no death has been reported. The pandemic situation in Vietnam is significantly
different from that in other countries. Vietnam has implemented strong measures against the
SARS-CoV-2 transmission at an early stage. However, the country has limited resources, hence
understanding the time of intensive monitoring will be helpful to plan for effective measures to
minimize the risk for hidden SARS-CoV-2 infection. While there are several studies attempting
to estimate the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, to date, there is not yet a study estimating
this parameter using data from Vietnam. This study aims to estimate the incubation period of
Vietnamese confirmed COVID-19 cases.

METHODS
Data sources and collection
Data of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were made publicly available on the official
website of Ministry of Health of Vietnam (ncov.moh.gov.vn). Case reports include patient

number, travelling history, contact tracing and clusters, date of laboratory-confirmed, date of
assertion, date and status of discharge. Additionally, the clusters of COVID-19 in a northern
province of Vietnam have been described by Thanh et al [4]. Two researchers independently
reviewed the full text of each case report of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Vietnam from 23
January 2020 to 13 April 2020, and entered data into a standardized case reporting form to
establish a database for this study. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved by
discussion between two researchers and facilitated by a third researcher to reach consensus.
To assure the reliability of analysis, we selected only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are
Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset (including fever,
cough, and shortness of breath) and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
This window period is defined as the date range between the earliest possible exposure, which
is the first contact with confirmed cases and the latest exposure, which is the most recent
contact with confirmed cases in the clusters.
Statistical analysis
We assumed that the moment of infection occurred between the interval of possible SARS-CoV2 exposure. The distribution of incubation period was estimated using maximum likelihood
where the likelihood function of each case in the dataset was a single interval-censored by three
parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference: Weibull
distribution, the Gamma distribution and the Lognormal distribution. Non-informative positive
prior for the parameters of the three distributions were specified. Leave-one-out Information
Criterion (LooIC) was used to assess the performance of three models. The differences of
LooIC larger than two were considered as statistically significant [5].

Mean, median and

posterior Credible Interval (CI) for each distribution were also estimated. Statistical analysis was
conducted by rstan [6] in R 3.6.4 [7]. Data for analysis and R codes are available on public
repository https://github.com/longbui/Covid19IncubVN

From 23 Jan 2020 to 13 Apr 2020, a total of 265 positive-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was reported
in Vietnam. Of those, 163 cases were identified as imported, 102 were locally infected. There
were 19 confirmed COVID-19 cases found between 23 January to 13 April 2020, who met the
inclusion criteria. These include being Vietnamese nationality, locally infected with SARS-CoV2, and had completed epidemiological data on exposure interval and date of symptom onset. Of
these cases, 7 were male and 12 were female. The median age was 37 (interquartile range: 25
– 50).
Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to
6.4 days (Table 1). According to the LooIc of proposed models, the Weibull distribution
demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of the incubation period using
Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% CI 4.89 –8.5), the standard deviation (SD) was
3.05 (95%CI 3.05 – 5.30). The Gamma distribution model fitted significantly poorer than the
Weibull model. The estimated mean of the incubation period of this model was 6.07 days (95%
CI: 4.64 – 8.00), with the SD of 2.90 days (95% CI 1.91 – 4.80), The lognormal distribution
showed the poorest fit to the data, the incubation period was estimated to be 6.4 (95% CI 4.6 –
10.2).
Estimation of median of incubation period using different models are presented in Table 2.
Figure 1 shows the estimation distribution of incubation periods using Weibull model, with
estimated median of 6.1 days, ranging from 1.4 to 13.0 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Detail
estimated possible moment of infection with Weibull distribution is illustrated in Figure 2. The
results suggest a large variation in incubation periods among patients but it was most likely to
fall in the period within 14 days of infection.

DISCUSSION
We estimated the incubation period of Vietnamese confirmed COVID-19 cases from public
reported data with three parametric models, including Weibull, Gamma and Lognornal

distribution. The Weibull distribution proved to be best fit to the data. Our estimation results are
similar or higher than most results from published literature (Table 3). Our estimation of 6.4 days
for mean incubation period is similar to the estimation of Backer et al [8]. The estimated mean in
our study is higher in comparison with that of other studies [9-12], which ranged from 4.9 to 5.6
days. Only one study by Leung [13] estimated longer incubation periods than our estimation
among local residents of Wuhan. When comparing the estimated median and its range with
other study, we saw a similar trend where our estimations are similar or higher than most
studies where median estimation was available [8, 10-12]. Nonetheless, extreme estimation of
incubation periods (95th or 97.5th percentiles) in studies are well within 14 days from possible
infection [8, 10-13].
The estimated mean of incubation period for 19 Vietnamese confirmed COVID-19 cases using
Weibull distribution model is higher than that of SARS in Hong Kong and Beijing [14] and in
MERS [15, 16]. Hence, mathematical models of COVID-19 should not be fitted with incubation
period of MERS or SARS.
The variation of incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 could be explained by the difference on the
strain of the virus, the biological variations of population and the control measures of certain
country. It is suggested that any interpretation of results on incubation time of SARS‐CoV‐2 is
strongly dependent on the selected data sources [9]. In Vietnam, the key COVID-19 control
strategy has focused on active case finding, early testing, treating and strictly isolating cases,
which has been considered as effective in finding people with SARS-CoV-2 positive and
providing treatment prior to clinical symptoms presentation. It is also a possible circumstance
that people with suggestive symptoms of respiratory diseases may take drugs before seeking
diagnosis and treatment.
In this study, the plausible range of incubation period estimated using the Weibull distribution
supports the importance to isolate confirmed and suspected cases, and close contacts for 14
days after exposure. However, we recommend the policy makers to consider the upper bound

of this range (97.5th percentile 13.0, CI 10.6–20.7). As such, the quarantine period should be
extended up to three weeks.
Our study has several strengths, including being the first effort to estimate SAR-CoV-2
incubation period using data from Vietnamese locally transmitted cases. We also used 3
different models for estimation and identified the model that best fitted with our data. However,
there are potential limitations in our study. First, not all confirmed COVID-19 cases have
completed epidemiological data on exposure interval and date of symptom onset available on
public government reports. Second, the number of patients included in the analysis is small,
possibly explaining the wider range of estimated incubation period. This highlights the need for
data standardization for further studies on COVID-19 and the importance of publishing data for
the scientific and public health community [9].
This study may contribute to the effort of COVID-19 control effort in Vietnam and elsewhere by
providing an informed estimate of the incubation period. This is a key variable needed for
modelling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, for informed decision-making throughout the pandemic.
Similar methodology could be used to estimate the incubation period for other countries and
diseases.
