Cell-based therapy for COVID-19: A living systematic review

ABSTRACT
Objective
This living systematic review aims to provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the
available evidence on the role of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Data sources
We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L-OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L-OVE is a
platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19
emergency, L-OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customised to group all
COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until April 23, 2020 (one day before
submission).

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods
We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the
speci cities of this question. We searched for randomised trials evaluating the effect of cell-based therapies
versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomised trials directly
addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened
each study for eligibility.
A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will
resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.

Results
We screened 1,043 records but no study was considered eligible.
We identi ed 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomised trials evaluating different types of cell-based
therapies in COVID-19.

Conclusions
We did not nd any studies that met our inclusion criteria and hence there is no evidence to support or refute
the use of cell-based therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing
studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision makers in the near future.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is an infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1]. It was rst identi ed in Wuhan,
China, on December 31, 2019 [2]; By April 23, 2020, the number of con rmed COVID-19 cases had
reached 2,761,121, with 193,671 con rmed deaths [3]. On March 11, 2020, WHO characterised the
COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic [1].
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some might progress to pneumonia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome, and death [4],[5],[6]. The case fatality rate reported across
countries, settings and age groups is highly variable, but it ranges from about 0.5% to 10% [7]. In
some centres it has been reported to be higher than 10% in hospitalised patients [8].
Cell-based therapy is a treatment in which viable nucleated cells are injected, grafted or implanted
into a patient in order to obtain a medicinal effect. Mesenchymal stem cells are the main type of
cell-based therapy proposed in the context of COVID-19, but many others are being actively
researched [9]. Mesenchymal stem cells exhibit a capacity for homing to sites of injury and
in ammation where they exert antiin ammatory and immunomodulatory effects [10]. They can
affect the status of T cells and skew them towards a regulatory phenotype, and they also interact
with B cells, inhibiting B cell response [11].

Cell-based therapy for COVID-19: A living systematic review

Preclinical studies in COVID-19 patients suggest mesenchymal stromal cells would be able to
reduce in ammation [12]. Several

ndings support this hypothesis, such as the expression of

antiin ammatory and trophic factors, and the decrease of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, and cytokine-secreting immune cells [13].
In consequence, it is expected that these cells could attenuate the overactivation of the immune
system and support repair by modulating the lung microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Some small studies in humans and newspaper reports have sparked global interest in this
treatment, but high-quality evidence is still lacking [14].
Using innovative and agile processes, taking advantage of technological tools, and resorting to the
collective effort of several research groups, this living systematic review aims to provide a timely,
rigorous and continuously updated summary of the available evidence on the role of cell-based
therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

METHODS
This manuscript complies with the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses’ (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [15] (see
Appendix 1 - PRISMA Checklist).
A protocol stating the shared objectives and methodology of multiple evidence syntheses
(systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews) to be conducted in parallel for different
questions relevant to COVID-19 was published elsewhere [16]. The review was registered in
PROSPERO with the number CRD42020179711 and a detailed protocol was uploaded to a preprint
server [17]

2. Discussion of terms with content and methods experts to identify relevant, irrelevant and
missing terms.
3.

Creation of a sensitive boolean strategy encompassing all the relevant terms

4. Iterative analysis of articles missed by the boolean strategy, and re nement of the strategy
accordingly.
Our main search source was Epistemonikos database (https://www.epistemonikos.org), a
comprehensive database of systematic reviews and other types of evidence [19] that we have
supplemented it with information coming from 35 sources relevant to COVID-19. The list of sources
that have been added to Epistemonikos Database is continuously expanded. This list of sources
regularly screened by Epistemonikos for COVID-19 is updated regularly in our website [20].
We conducted additional searches using highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Embase.
The searches in Epistemonikos are continuously updated [20] but were last checked the day of
submission of this article (April 24, 2020). The additional searches were updated on April 23, 2020,
and covered the period from the inception date of each database. No study design, publication
status or language restriction were applied to the searches in Epistemonikos or the additional
electronic searches.
The following strategy was used to search in Epistemonikos Database. We adapted it to the syntax
of other databases (see Appendix 2 - Search strategies).

Other sources
In order to identify articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we proceed, if
necessary, as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Screened the reference lists of other systematic reviews.
Scanned the reference lists of selected guidelines, narrative reviews and other documents.
Reviewed websites specialised in COVID-19.
Email the contact authors of all the included studies to ask for additional publications or
data on their studies, and for other studies in the topic.
Conduct cross-citation searches in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, using each
included study as the index reference.
Review the reference list of each included study.

Eligibility criteria
Types of studies
This living review preferentially includes randomised trials. Non-randomised studies are included if
there is no direct evidence from randomised trials or the certainty of evidence for the critical
outcomes resulting from the randomised trials is graded as low- or very low, and the certainty
provided by the non-randomised evidence grades higher than the one provided by the randomised
evidence [21].
We exclude studies evaluating the effects on animal models or in vitro conditions.

Types of participants
We include trials assessing participants with COVID-19, as de ned by the authors of the trials.
Whenever we

nd substantial clinical heterogeneity on how the condition was de ned, we explore

it using a sensitivity analysis.
If we do not nd direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the evidence from randomised trials
provided low- or very low-certainty evidence for critical outcomes, we consider eligible randomised
trials evaluating cell-based therapy in other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV or
SARS-CoV infections [21].

Cell-based therapy for COVID-19: A living systematic review

Type of interventions
The interventions of interest are cell-based therapies obtained from any tissue, including
mesenchymal stromal cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and any other therapy in which viable
nucleated cells are injected, grafted or implanted into a patient in order to obtain a medicinal
effect.
We do not restrict our criteria to any dosage, duration, timing or route of administration.
The comparison of interest is placebo/sham (cell-based therapy plus optimal treatment versus
placebo plus optimal treatment) or no treatment (cell-based therapy plus optimal treatment versus
optimal treatment).
Trials assessing cell-based therapy plus other interventions are eligible if the cointerventions are
identical in both the intervention and the comparison groups.
Trials evaluating cell-based therapy in combination with other active interventions versus placebo
or no treatment are also eligible.

Type of outcomes
We do not use the outcomes as an inclusion criteria during the selection process. Any article
meeting all the criteria except for the outcome criterion is preliminarily included and assessed in
full text.
We used the core outcome set COS-COVID [22], the existing guidelines and reviews and the
judgement of the authors of this review as an input for selecting the primary and secondary
outcomes, as well as to decide upon inclusion. The review team regularly revise this list of
outcomes, in order to incorporate ongoing efforts to de ne Core Outcomes Sets (e.g. COVID-19
Core Outcomes [23].

If we include at least one study, primary and secondary outcomes are presented in the GRADE
‘Summary of Findings’ tables, and a table with all the outcomes is presented as an appendix [24].

Selection of studies
The results of the literature search in Epistemonikos database are automatically incorporated into
the L·OVE platform (automated retrieval). There they are de-duplicated by an algorithm that
compares unique identi ers (database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e. author
names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title, and article abstract).
The additional searches are uploaded to the screening software Collaboratron™ [25].
In both L·OVE platform and Collaboratron™, two researchers independently screen the titles and
abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. We obtain the full reports for all titles that
appear to meet the inclusion criteria or require further analysis, and then decide about their inclusion.

We record the reasons for excluding trials in any stage of the search and outline the study selection
process in a PRISMA ow diagram which we adapted for the purpose of this project .

Extraction and management of data
Using standardised forms, two reviewers independently extract data from each included and ongoing study.
We collect the following information: study design, setting, participant characteristics (including disease
severity and age) and study eligibility criteria; details about the administered intervention and comparison,
including source of cells, dose, duration and timing (i.e. time after diagnosis); the outcomes assessed and the
time they were measured; the source of funding of the study and the con icts of interest disclosed by the
investigators; the risk of bias assessment for each individual study.
We resolve disagreements by discussion, and one arbiter adjudicates unresolved disagreements.

Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias for each randomised trial is assessed by using the 'risk of bias' tool (RoB 2.0: a
revised tool to assess risk of bias in randomised trials) [26]. We consider the effect of assignment
to the intervention for this review. Two reviewers independently assess

ve domains of bias for

each outcome result of all reported outcomes and time points. These ve domains are: bias due to
(1) the randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions (effects of assignment to
interventions at baseline), (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5)
selection of reported results. Answers to signalling questions and collectively supporting

-

information leads to a domain level judgement in the form of 'Low risk of bias', 'Some concerns', or

-

'High risk of bias'. These domain level judgements inform an overall 'risk of bias' judgement for each
result. Discrepancies between review authors are resolved by discussion to reach consensus. If
necessary, a third review author is consulted to achieve a decision.

-

We assess the risk of bias of other study designs with the ROBINS I tool (ROBINS-I: Risk Of Bias In
Non-randomised Studies of Interventions) [27]. We address the following domains: bias due to
confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classi cation of interventions,
bias due to deviations from intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention), bias due
to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes and bias in the selection of the reported result.
We judge each domain as low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, critical risk, or no information, and

-

evaluate individual bias items as described in ROBINS-I guidance. We do not consider time varying
confounding, as these confounders are not relevant in this setting [28].
We consider the following factors as baseline potential confounders:

●
●
●
●

Age
Comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, renal disease, eye disease, liver disease)
Co-interventions
Severity, as de ned by the authors (i.e respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome
vs ICU requirement).

Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous outcomes, we express the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as risk
ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) along with 95% con dence intervals (CI).
For continuous outcomes, we use the mean difference and standard deviation (SD) to summarise
the data using a 95% CI. Whenever continuous outcomes are measured using different scales, the
treatment effect is expressed as a standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. When
possible, we multiply the SMD by a standard deviation that is representative from the pooled
studies, for example, the SD from a well-known scale used by several of the studies included in the
analysis on which the result is based. In cases where the minimally important difference (MID) is
known, we present continuous outcomes as MID units or inform the results as the difference in the
proportion of patients achieving a minimal important effect between intervention and control [28].
Then, these results are displayed on the 'Summary of Findings Table' as mean difference [28].

Strategy for data synthesis
If we include more than one trial, we conduct meta-analysis for studies clinically homogeneous
using RevMan 5 [29], using the inverse variance method with random effects model. For any
outcomes where data are insu

cient to calculate an effect estimate, a narrative synthesis is

presented.

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
We perform subgroup analysis according to the de nition of severe COVID-19 infection (i.e
respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome vs ICU requirement). In case we identify
signi cant differences between subgroups (test for interaction <0.05) we report the results of
individual subgroups separately.
We perform sensitivity analysis excluding high risk of bias studies, and if non-randomised studies
are used, excluding studies that do not report adjusted estimates. In cases where the primary
analysis effect estimates and the sensitivity analysis effect estimates signi cantly differ, we either
present the low risk of bias — adjusted sensitivity analysis estimates — or present the primary
analysis estimates but downgrading the certainty of the evidence because of risk of bias.

Assessment of certainty of evidence
The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is judged using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology (GRADE Working Group)

[30], across the domains of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and reporting bias.
Certainty is adjudicated as high, moderate, low or very low. For the main comparisons and
outcomes, we prepare Summary of Findings (SoF) tables [28],[31] and also interactive Summary of
Findings tables (http://isof.epistemonikos.org/). A SoF table with all the comparisons and
outcomes is presented as an appendix.

Living evidence synthesis
An arti cial intelligence algorithm deployed in the Coronavirus/COVID-19 topic of the L·OVE
platform provides instant noti cation of articles with a high likelihood of being eligible. The authors
review them, decide upon inclusion, and update the living web version of the review accordingly.
We expect to resubmit to a journal any time there is a change in the direction of the effect on the
critical outcomes or a substantial modi cation to the certainty of the evidence.
This review is part of a larger project set up to produce multiple parallel systematic reviews
relevant to COVID-19 [16].

RESULTS
Results of the search
We used a repository that includes searches in 34 trial registries, pre-print servers and websites
specialised in COVID-19. We also conducted additional searches in 3 electronic databases and
scanned the references of multiple guidelines, reviews and other documents.
The search in the L·OVE platform retrieved 272 records, and the additional searches retrieved 771
records (total records screened = 1 043). We considered 78 as potentially eligible and retrieved and
evaluated their full texts. However, none of the studies were eligible for inclusion.
The reasons for exclusion are described in the Appendix 3 - List of relevant studies

Cell-based therapy for COVID-19: A living systematic review

DISCUSSION
We performed a comprehensive search of the literature and did not nd any randomised trials
evaluating the effect of cell-based therapies in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating this lack of
randomised trials, we also searched for non-randomised, comparative studies in COVID-19 and for
randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
These additional searches provided no relevant studies either. In sum, we did not nd any studies
ful lling the minimum requirements to inform decisions.
Systematic reviews are the gold standard to collect and summarize the available evidence
regarding a scienti c question. However, the traditional model for conducting reviews has several
limitations, including high demand for time and resources [34] and a rapid obsolescence [35].
Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, researchers should make their best effort to answer the urgent needs
of health decision makers yet without giving up scienti c accuracy. Information is being produced
at a vertiginous speed [36], so alternative models are needed.
One potential solution to these shortfalls are rapid reviews, reviews that omit some of the steps of
a traditional systematic review in order to move faster. Unfortunately, in these reviews rapidity
comes at the cost of quality [37]. Furthermore, they do not solve the issue of obsolescence. Living
systematic reviews do address that issue [38] . They are continually updated by incorporating
relevant new evidence as it becomes available, at a substantial effort. So, an approach combining
these two models might prove more successful in providing the scienti c community and other
interested parties with evidence that is actionable, rapidly and e

ciently produced, up to date, and

of the highest quality [39].
This review is part of a larger project set up to put such an approach into practice. The project aims
to produce multiple parallel living systematic reviews relevant to COVID-19 following the higher
standards of quality in evidence synthesis production [19]. We believe our methods are well suited
to handle the abundance of evidence that is to come, including evidence on the role of cell-based
therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We have identi ed multiple ongoing studies
addressing this question, including 39 randomised trials, which will provide valuable evidence to
inform researchers and decision makers in the near future.
We found two systematic reviews, with a broad scope, addressing the question of this article
[40],[41]. Their conclusions are similar in terms of the lack of evidence available.
So, the main limitation of the existing systematic reviews, including ours, results from the absence
of any evidence to inform decisions.

Cell-based therapy for COVID-19: A living systematic review

Nonetheless, decisions should be made even if the evidence is considered insu

cient [42. While

the evidence about the potential bene t emerges, decision makers will have to ponder other
relevant aspects [43].
We think the main factors that decision makers must put in the balance are the high costs of this
treatment. On the other hand, researchers in this eld should deepen our understanding about how
cell-therapies work and which speci c therapy is the better option. We hope that the high number
of studies that are expected to be completed in the next months will shed some light on these
issues.
During the COVID-19 pandemic we will maintain a living, web-based, openly available version of this
review, and we will resubmit the review every time the conclusions change or whenever there are
substantial updates. Our systematic review aims to provide a high-quality, up-to-date synthesis of
the evidence that is useful for clinicians and other decision makers.

NOTES
Differences between protocol and review
Our original protocol intended to include studies evaluating mesenchymal stem cells, the main type
of cell-based therapy proposed in the context of COVID-19. In consultation with experts in the eld,
we expanded our criteria to include other types of cell-based therapies as well.
