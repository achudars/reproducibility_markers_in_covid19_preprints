Abstract: The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection that were confirmed
outside of China provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case
fatality risk (cCFR) in mainland China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the
severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic.
Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the
cCFR and the basic reproduction number—the average number of secondary cases generated by a
single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index
case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with
the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January,
2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885,
9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR
were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The
basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for
Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19
epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides
insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.

1. Introduction
Since 8 December, 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology have emerged in
Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [1,2]. Virological investigation suggests that the causative agent
of this pneumonia is a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) [3]. As of 27 January, 2020, a total of 4515 cases
including 106 deaths were confirmed [4]. Forty-one cases of COVID-19 infections were also reported
outside China, in other Asian countries, the United States, France, Australia, and Canada.
A local market selling seafood and wildlife in Wuhan was visited by many cases in the initial
cluster, indicating that a common-source zoonotic exposure may have been the main mode of
transmission [5]. However, even after shutting down the market, the number of cases continued to
grow across China and several instances of household transmission were reported [6]. It is now
speculated that sustained human-to-human transmission aided in the establishment of the epidemic
[7] and that reported case counts greatly underestimated the actual number of infections in China
[8].
Early assessment of the severity of infection and transmissibility can help quantify the

of the
epidemic. One important epidemiological measure of severity is case fatality risk (CFR), which can

be measured with three different approaches, by estimating (i) the proportion of the cumulative
number of deaths out of the cumulative number of cases at a point in time, (ii) the ratio of the
cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infected individuals whose clinical
outcome is known (i.e., the deceased or recovered), and (iii) the risk of death among confirmed
cases, explicitly accounting for the time from illness onset to death [9]. Estimating the CFR using the
ratio of deaths to confirmed cases (cCFR), with an adjustment of the time delay from illness onset to
death (i.e., method (iii)), can provide insight into severity of the disease, because the naïve CFR
based on method (i) tends to be underestimated due to the real-time nature of the growth of fatal
cases. For example, during the early stage of an epidemic, failing to right-censor cases with respect to
the time delay from illness onset to death may lead to underestimation of the CFR. This is because
death due to infection may yet occur following case identification [9–11].
When the CFR denominator only includes confirmed cases it is referred to as the cCFR [10] and
may overestimate the actual CFR among all infected individuals due to under-ascertainment of
infections in the population. Nonetheless, the cCFR is still a valuable measure of the upper bound of
the symptomatic CFR (sCFR) among all symptomatic cases, particularly in circumstances of high
uncertainty, such as the emergence of a new human pathogen (i.e., COVID-19).
The basic reproduction number (𝑅0 ), the average number of secondary cases generated by a
single primary case in a fully susceptible population, represents an epidemiological measurement
of the transmissibility, helping us to quantify the pandemic potential of COVID-19. Here, we define
a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a newly emerged disease, in which the number of
simultaneously infected individuals exceeds the capacity for treatment [12]. Using the growth rate
of the estimated cumulative incidence from exportation cases and accounting for the time delay
from illness onset to death, the present study aims to estimate the cCFR of COVID-19 in real-time.
2. Methods
2.1. Epidemiological Data
Information on exported COVID-19 cases who were confirmed in other countries and deaths
due to COVID-19 infection in China were retrieved from the first announcement date of the current
outbreak (i.e., 31 December, 2019) through 24 January, 2020. The cutoff time of 24 January, 2020 was
specifically selected to reflect the governmental ban on public transportation from Wuhan
(including flights) which was invoked on 23 January, 2020 [13]. All data were collected either from
government websites or from media quoting government announcements. Our data include 51
cases diagnosed outside China who had illness onset through 24 January, 2020 and were reported
by 9 February, 2020 and the dates of illness onset and death among 41 deceased cases in China.
2.2. Estimation of the Delay Distributions
The observed incidence i(t) by date of illness onset t is modeled using an exponential growth
model with the rate r: 𝑖(𝑡) = 𝑖0 𝑒 𝑟𝑡 , where i0 is the expected number of infected cases at time t = 0.
The cumulative incidence I(t) is an integral of i(t) over the time interval from zero to t that can be
𝑡
written as 𝐼(𝑡) = ∫0 𝑖(𝑠)d𝑠 = 𝑖0 (𝑒 𝑟𝑡 − 1)/𝑟. The cumulative incidence is adjusted to the date of
report by the factor u dependent on the parameters of the delay distribution. For the estimation of
time delay distribution from illness onset to death, we accounted for right truncation and modeled
and used a lognormal distribution with parameters adopted from an earlier study [14]. Let 𝑓(𝑡; 𝜃)
be the lognormal distribution with parameters 𝜃𝑑 = {𝑎𝑑 , 𝑏𝑑 }. Then, the cumulative incidence I(t) by
date of report t can be adjusted to the time from illness onset to death and report by simply
multiplying it by the factor 𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃𝑑 ), which is a consequence of the exponentially growing epidemic
[10]. The factor u is defined by the following integral:
∞

𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃𝑑 ) = ∫ exp(−𝑟𝑠) 𝑓(𝑠; 𝜃𝑑 )𝑑𝑠
0

The adjusted cumulative incidence then obeys 𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃𝑑 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡). The cumulative number of deaths D(t)
reported by date t is the result of Binomial sampling:
𝐷(𝑡) ~ binom(size = 𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃𝑑 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡), prob = 𝐶𝐹𝑅(𝑡))

(2)

Let 𝑎𝑒 and 𝑏𝑒 be the shape and inverse scale of the gamma distribution modeling the distribution
of time interval from illness onset to the report for observed exported cases. The cumulative
incidence in China can be then adjusted by the multiplicative factor 𝑢̃(𝑟, 𝜃𝑒 = {𝑎𝑒 , 𝑏𝑒 }). The number
of exported cases E(t) can then be sampled from another Binomial distribution:
𝐸(𝑡) ~ binom(size = 𝑢̃(𝑟, 𝜃𝑒 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡), prob = 𝑝)

(3)

where p describes the probability of finding a traveler from Wuhan among all travelers from China
subject to the detection time window of the virus T = 12.5 days [8]. Given that the total volume of
inbound passengers from China is M = 5.56 million passengers per year, the fraction of Wuhan
travelers is 𝜙 = 0.021%, and the population of Wuhan is n = 11 million, the probability p is given by

2.3. Statistical Inference
First, we fitted the delay distribution of the time from illness onset to report Δ𝑇𝑒,𝑘 (𝑘 ≤ 𝐾𝑒 ) to
the gamma distribution. We define the log-likelihood as follows:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝑒 (𝜃𝑒 | Δ𝑇𝑒,𝑘 ) = ∑ log(gamma(Δ𝑇𝑒,𝑘 | shape = 𝑎𝑒 , scale = 𝑏𝑒 )

(5)

𝑘

that is maximized to find the mean values of the parameters 𝜃̃𝑒 = {𝑎̃𝑒 , 𝑏̃𝑒 }, used in the following
step.
Second, we fitted the observed counts of exported cases and deaths by considering two other
likelihoods respectively to each process:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝐸 ({𝑟, 𝑖0 } | {𝐸(𝑡), 𝑡𝑒 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑇})
𝑇

= ∑ log (binom(𝐸(𝑡) | size = 𝑢̃(𝑟, 𝜃̃𝑒 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡), prob = 𝑝))

(6)

𝑡=𝑡𝑒

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝐷 ({𝑟, 𝑖0 , 𝐶𝐹𝑅(𝑡)} | {𝐷(𝑡), 𝑡𝑑 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑇})
𝑇

= ∑ log(binom(𝐷(𝑡) | size = 𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃𝑑 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡), prob = 𝐶𝐹𝑅(𝑡)))

(7)

𝑡=𝑡𝑑

where 𝑡𝑒 and 𝑡𝑑 are the times at which the first exportation event and the first death are observed.
The total log-likelihood is given by the sum of two log-likelihoods:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿Σ (𝜃Σ = {𝑟, 𝑖0 , CFR(𝑡)}|𝐷(𝑡), 𝐸(𝑡))
= 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝐸 ({𝑟, 𝑖0 } |𝐸(𝑡)) + 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿𝐷 ({𝑟, 𝑖0 , 𝐶𝐹𝑅(𝑡)}|𝐷(𝑡))

(8)

which is then maximized to determine the best-fit parameters {𝑟, 𝑖0 , 𝐶𝐹𝑅(𝑡)}.
We considered two possible scenarios to fit to the data. In the first scenario (refers to “Scenario
1”), the parameter 𝑖0 is fixed at one on the date of illness onset for the first COVID-19 confirmed
case (i.e., 8 December, 2019), providing a fixed starting point for the exponential growth of the
cumulative incidence. Although 8 December, 2019 is assumed as the starting point for exponential
growth of the cumulative incidence in Scenario 1, there is still uncertainty using this date as a proxy
for the beginning of exponential growth due to inconsistencies reported on illness onset for the
earliest reported cases [2,5]. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where the start date for
exponential growth was varied between 1 December and 10 December, 2019. In the second scenario

(refers to “Scenario 2”), all parameters {𝑟, 𝑖0 , 𝐶𝐹𝑅(𝑡)} are variable, and calculation begins on the
date the first exported case was observed (i.e., 13 January, 2020). For both scenarios, we conducted
sensitivity analyses that estimated the growth rate, cumulative incidence, and cCFR value using
different cut-off times, values of the detection window T, and sizes of the catchment population of
the Wuhan International airport n.
The value of the basic reproduction number 𝑅0 for the COVID-19 epidemic was calculated as
𝑅0 = 1 + 𝑟𝑆

(9)

where r is the estimated growth rate for each scenario and S is the mean serial interval for
successive COVID-19 infections. The value of the serial interval was adopted from a published
study [2], and a gamma distribution was fitted to six known pairs of the infectee and infector (mean
= 7.5 days, standard deviation (SD) = 3.4 days).
In our analysis, we employed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations with eight
chains of 4250 samples each, with 2500 samples used for the tuning stage, leveraging the
No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) part of the Python PyMC3 package. However, one of the input
variables for the Binomial distribution 𝑢̃(𝑟, 𝜃𝑒 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡) or 𝑢(𝑟, 𝜃𝑑 ) ⋅ 𝐼(𝑡) was modeled with a
continuous variable in our approach. We used the gamma distribution, matching the first two
moments to obtain the transformation of the discrete Binomial distribution to its continuous
approximation [16]. We avoided joint estimation of all parameters {𝜃Σ , 𝜃𝑒 , 𝜃𝑑 } due to heterogeneity
in the aggregated data—a similar issue is discussed in [10]. Instead, we implemented a sequential
fitting: first we considered only the likelihood 𝐿𝑒 , then we fit the likelihood 𝐿Σ using the mean
values of the estimated parameters obtained in the previous round. Finally, we verified the
obtained fit by calculating pointwise estimates using maximum likelihood estimation with
confidence intervals derived as profile likelihood-based intervals. We found that both approaches
were at complete agreement in their results.
3. Results
Figures 1A,B show the mean and SD of the time from illness onset to reporting and death,
respectively. Employing the gamma distribution, the mean time from illness onset to reporting was
estimated at 7.1 days (95% CI: 5.9, 8.4). The mean time from illness onset to death—adopted from a
previous study [14]—was estimated at 20.2 days (95% CI: 15.1, 29.5), which led to the lognormal
distribution with location parameter of 2.84 and scale parameter of 0.52.

days (95% CI: 6.5, 21.6) employing a lognormal distribution and accounting for right truncation. For
reference, the estimate of the mean and its 95% credible intervals without accounting for right
truncation are shown in grey. The values for distribution of time from illness onset to death are
adopted from an earlier study [14]. The blue bars show empirically observed data collected from
governmental reports (as of 24 January, 2020).

Subsequently, the cumulative incidence was estimated from exported case data by fitting an
exponentially growing incidence curve for both Scenarios 1 and 2 (Figure 2). As of 24 January, 2020,
20 exported cases were reported, and the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 6924 cases
(95% CI: 4885, 9211) in Scenario 1 and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158) in Scenario 2. Table 1
shows the real-time update of the estimated cumulative incidence. The exponential growth rates (r),
derived from the growth rate of cumulative incidence, were estimated at 0.15 per day (95% CI: 0.14,
0.15) and 0.29 per day (95% CI: 0.22, 0.36) in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

the government of mainland China. The cumulative number of reported cases was not used for
fitting, but it was shown for comparison between the cumulative number of reported and estimated
cases in China. There is a decrease in the cumulative number of reported cases in early January,
because only 41 cases tested positive for the novel coronavirus among the reported 59 cases on 10
Jan, 2020. Left-top panels on both A and B show the cumulative numbers of exported cases observed
in other countries and the cumulative number of deaths in China, represented by dark and light

credible intervals were derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.

CI, confidence interval (the 95% CI was derived from the Markov chain Monte Carlo method).
Scenario 1 indicates the estimated exponential growth rate with the assumed illness onset date of the
first COVID-19 case (i.e., 8 December, 2019), while Scenario 2 presents the estimated exponential
growth rate from the date of first exportation event (i.e., 13 January, 2020).

Figures 2C and 2D show the estimated cCFR value accounting for the time delay from illness
onset to death under Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. A total of 41 confirmed deaths were reported as
of 24 January, 2020, the cCFR value was estimated at 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%–7.5%) for Scenario 1 and
8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%–12.3%) for Scenario 2, respectively.
We estimated the basic reproduction number for the COVID-19 infection, using the estimated
exponential growth (r) and accounting for possible variations of the mean serial interval (Figure 3).
Assuming that the mean serial interval was 7.5 days [2], the basic reproduction number was
estimated at 2.10 (95% CI: 2.04, 2.16) and 3.19 (95% CI: 2.66, 3.69) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.
However, as the mean serial interval varies, the estimates can range from 1.6 to 2.6 and 2.2 to 4.2 for
Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively.

Figure 3. Basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in China, 2020.
Black lines and grey shades represent the median and 95% credible intervals of the basic
reproduction number. Panel A shows the result of Scenario 1, in which an exponential growth
started from the assumed illness onset date of index case, while Panel B shows the result from
exponential growth from the first exported case (Scenario 2). The 95% credible intervals were derived
from Markov chain Monte Carlo method.

To address the uncertainty in the unobserved date of illness onset of the index case in Scenario
1, cCFR was estimated by varying the starting date of the exponential growth in the incidence by
placing the single index case between 1 and 10 December, 2019 (Figure S1 and Table S1). When we
assumed the date of illness onset of the index case was 1 December, 2019, the estimated incidence in
China and the cCFR on 24 January, 2020 were estimated at 4718 (95% CI: 3328, 6278) and 5.3% (95%
CI: 3.5, 7.6). The sensitivity analyses for varied cutoff dates between 15 and 24 January, 2020 were
conducted. Depending on the number of time points, the estimates of the cumulative incidence and

cCFR have similar values in Scenario 1 (Figure S2) but slightly decreased in Scenario 2, when the
cutoff date was earlier (Figure S3). In addition, considering the uncertainty of two fixed parameters
(i.e., detection time window and catchment population in Wuhan airport), sensitivity was assessed
by varying those parameters. As the catchment population increases and the detection window time
decreases, estimated cCFR on 24 January, 2020 gets smaller due to increased number of incidence in
China (Table S2 and S3).
4. Discussion
The present study estimated the risk of death among confirmed cases while addressing
ascertainment bias by using data from cases diagnosed outside mainland China and a
right-censored likelihood for modeling the count of deceased cases. The estimated cCFR value was
5.3% [3.5, 7.5] when the date of illness onset for the index case was fixed a priori at 8 December, 2019
(Scenario 1), and 8.4% [5.3, 12.3%] when the timing of the exponential growth of epidemic was fitted
to data alongside with other model parameters (Scenario 2). The estimated value of u in Scenario 2,
which adjusts the time delay from illness onset to death, was smaller than that in Scenario 1 due to
the larger value of the growth rate of incidence, while the estimated cCFR value as of 24 January,
2020 was larger in Scenario 2 compared with Scenario 1. Depending on the available data, the
estimate of the cCFR (i.e., the delay-adjusted risk of death among confirmed cases) may vary in
time and show some fluctuations. In addition to that, we estimated the value of the basic
reproduction number 𝑅0 in the range of 1.6–2.6 for Scenario 1 and 2.2–4.2 for Scenario 2. From either
estimate, we conclude that COVID-19 has substantial potential to spread via human-to-human
transmission. However, R0 > 1 does not guarantee that a single exported (and untraced) case would
immediately lead to a major epidemic in the destination country as government responses such as
border control, isolation of suspected cases, and intensive surveillance should serve to reduce
opportunities for transmission to occur [17–19].
Our cCFR estimates of 5.3% and 8.4% indicate that the severity of COVID-19 is not as high as
that of other diseases caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
which had an estimated CFR of 17% in Hong Kong [9,10,20], and Middle East respiratory syndrome,
which had an estimated CFR of 20% in South Korea [21]. Nonetheless, considering the overall
magnitude of the ongoing epidemic, a 5%–8% risk of death is by no means insignificant. In addition
to quantifying the overall risk of death, future research must identify groups at risk of death (e.g.,
the elderly and people with underlying comorbidities) [22,23]. Moreover, considering that about 9%
of all infected individuals are ascertained and reported [24], the infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e., the
risk of death among all infected individuals, would be on the order of 0.5% to 0.8%.
Our estimated 𝑅0 range of 1.6–4.2 for COVID-19 is consistent with other preliminary estimates
posted on public domains [25–28], and is comparable to the 𝑅0 of SARS, which was in the range of
2–5 during the 2003 outbreak in Singapore [15]. Between our two estimates, the latter scenario
yielded a greater value than the former, and there was an increasingly improved ascertainment in
early January 2020. The virus was identified and sequenced on 7 January, 2020 and subsequently, the
primer was widely distributed, allowing for rapid laboratory identification of cases and contributing
to a time-dependent increase in the number of confirmed cases out of China. Consequently, Scenario
2, which was fully dependent on the growth rate of exported cases, could have overestimated the
intrinsic growth rate of cases. Considering the estimated value of 𝑅0 , the possibility of
presymptomatic transmission in the ongoing epidemic is a critical question, as it would have a
substantial impact on public health response to the epidemic (e.g., whether the contact tracing
should be prioritized or not) as well as overall predictability of the epidemic during the
containment stage [29,30].
From the technical side, it should be emphasized that our proposed approach can be especially
useful during the early stage of an epidemic when local surveillance is affected by substantial
ascertainment bias and export and death data are available and better ascertained. Nonetheless,

changed the human migration network. Despite the decrease in the outbound flow of travelers from
Wuhan, there is a substantial risk that the next epidemic wave will originate from other cities.
There are five main limitations in the present study. First, our results present an estimate for the
cCFR which only addresses fatality among confirmed cases. More precise IFR estimate that includes
infected individuals other than confirmed cases can only be estimated using additional pieces of
data (e.g., seroepidemiological data or outpatient clinic visits). It should be noted that not only the
denominator but also numerator values are also subject for better estimation (e.g. excess mortality
estimate). Second, our study relied on limited empirical data that were extracted from publicly
available data sources. Thus, future studies with greater sample size and precision are needed.
Nonetheless, we believe that this study will improve the situational assessment of the ongoing
epidemic. Third, our assumed date of illness onset for the index case in Scenario 1 is based on initial
reports of the earliest onset date for a case, and the continued exponential growth with the rate r is
the authors’ extrapolation. However, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and ensured that the
resulting statistical estimates would not greatly vary from our main results. Fourth, there is an
uncertainty in the detection window time T. Since the epidemiological investigations are being
actively implemented outside China, we believe that the sum of the incubation period and the
infectious period can be a plausible estimation of the detection time window. Fifth, heterogeneous
aspects of death (e.g. age and risk groups) need to be addressed in the future studies.
In conclusion, the present study has estimated cCFR to be on the order of 5%–8% and R0 to be
1.6–4.2, endorsing the notion that COVID-19 infection in the ongoing epidemic possesses the
potential to become a pandemic. The proposed approach can also help direct risk assessment in
other settings with the use of publicly available datasets.

A. Sensitivity analysis by varying the starting point of exponential growth of cumulative novel
coronavirus incidence from 1 December to 10 December, 2019
The starting point of exponential growth of cumulative case incidence was fixed as the illness onset
date of the index case (i.e, 8 December 2019) in Scenario 1, while it was allowed to vary from the day
the first exportation case was observed (i.e., 13 January 2020) in Scenario 2. However, since there is
uncertainty regarding the actual starting point of exponential growth in Scenario 1 due to
discrepancies in the date of illness onset for the first reported case, a sensitivity analysis was
conducted by varying this date from 1 December 2019 to 10 December 2019. Table S1 and Figure S1
show the estimated growth rate, cumulative incidence, and cCFR that result from this analysis.
