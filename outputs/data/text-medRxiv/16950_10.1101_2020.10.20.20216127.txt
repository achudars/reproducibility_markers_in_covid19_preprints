Abstract

18

Objectives

19

The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing globally and there is an

20

urgency for a simple non-invasive method for the detection of SARS-

21

CoV-2. Our study aimed to demonstrate that saliva can be used as a

22

specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection notably for the screening of

23

extensive population groups via pooling.

24

Methods

25

To demonstrate that saliva is an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-

26

2 detection a field study including 3,660 participants was performed

27

between September 29 and October 1, 2020. We collected paired

28

nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva specimens and

29

processed them within 24 hours of collection. We performed 36 serial

30

measurements of 8 SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples to confirm

31

the stability of the specimen and completed 37 pools of saliva samples

32

by adding one positive specimen per pool.

33

Results

34

Saliva specimens were stable for testing for up to 24 hours. Overall,

35

44 salival samples (1.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the

36

field study. The results of saliva samples were consistent with those

37

obtained from NPS from the same patient with 90% sensitivity (95%

38

CI 68.3%-98.7%) and 100% specificity during the first two weeks after

39

the onset of symptoms. Using pooling strategy 796 RT-PCR tests were

40

performed. All pools showed 100% positivity in different pooling

41

proportions.

43

Our findings demonstrate that saliva is an appropriate specimen for

44

pooling and SARS-CoV-2 screening with accurate diagnostic

45

performance. Patient-performed simple specimen collection allows

46

testing an extensive number of people rapidly, obtaining results of the

47

spread of SARS-CoV-2 and allowing authorities to take timely

48

measures.

Introduction

51

Since the beginning of 2020 massive resources have been dedicated to

52

control and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing capacity and

53

accessibility are crucial in monitoring COVID-19 outbreaks and

54

allowing for the adjustment of measures put into place to reduce

55

community transmission (1).

56

Viral nucleic acid detection using the real-time polymerase chain

57

reaction (RT-PCR) assay remains the gold standard for the detection

58

of SARS-CoV-2 and to diagnose COVID-19 (2). Due to the increased

59

demand for sampling and testing materials globally considerable

60

constraints remain to conduct widespread screening for SARS-CoV-2.

61

It is especially challenging for counties with low prevalence levels as

62

global suppliers allocate materials and decide delivery schedules based

63

on the prevalence of the virus.

64

Shortages of supplies and medical staff, logistical hurdles, as well the

65

unpleasantness associated with obtaining a RT-PCR specimen making

66

it difficult to practice the procedure on children and causing irritation

67

for those who need to undergo repeated tests, all these factors have

68

naturally accelerated research into alternative specimens and sampling

69

methods for COVID-19 testing (3,4).

70

On September 21, 2020, Latvia had a 14-day cumulative number of

71

COVID-19 cases of 5.1 per 100,000 people. By October 10 that

72

number had risen to 66. During this period, laboratories experienced a

73

significant overload (5). Rapid and efficient solutions to increase

74

testing capacity were needed.

75

The objective of this study was to confirm that saliva is a suitable

76

specimen comparable to a nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab for

77

SARS-CoV-2 detection in specific populations. We also evaluated the

78

pooling approach to employ it in field conditions for extensive

79

screening of high-risk groups.

80
81

Methods

82

Patient sample collection

83

A single-center study was performed including all consented patients

84

attending the laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 testing between May 12 and

85

October 19, 2020. For the collection of the saliva samples, self-

86

collection kits were distributed consisting of a specimen vial,

87

registration form, alcohol pads for disinfection, and two safety plastic

88

bags. Patients were requested to collect their saliva in an isolated

89

location (keeping at least five meters distance from other persons or

90

objects), preferably outdoors, at home, or in their car. The saliva was

91

collected in a container without any additive and delivered to the

92

laboratory within 24 hours. Paired nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal

93

swabs (NPS) for RT-PCR were collected using the standard method

94

used in our laboratory (6).

95

Sample preparation and analysis using RT-PCR

96

Immediately upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were

97

pretreated by adding 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The

98

extraction of RNA and RT-PCR testing was identical for both swab

99

and pre-treated saliva samples. Viral RNA was extracted with standard

100

commercial extraction methods (QIAGEN, Germany and LifeRiver,

101

China) used in our laboratory. RT-PCR was performed using our

102

laboratory-developed and validated test method which detects S and N

103

genes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our validated and verified limit of

104

detection (LOD) was 1 cp/rxn.

105
106

Results

107

Stability of saliva specimens

108

To confirm the stability of saliva samples, we performed 36 serial tests

109

on 8 primary SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples collected from

110

patients 48 hours after their NPS tested positive. The data are

111

summarized in Tables 1-3. Testing was randomized by different time

112

intervals, the time of day, and the shifts of technicians. It includes

113

repeated testing of two samples after 22h (Table 2) and serial repeats

114

of one sample (Table 3) with Ct value reporting.

115

All results confirmed a positive result after 22-25h of the first test

116

being conducted. Samples were stored refrigerated at 2-6⁰C between

117

tests.

118

Comparison of saliva and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples

119

Between May 13 and September 21, 2020, 431 tests on saliva samples

120

were performed, and the results were compared with paired NPS RT-

121

PCR test results. Using NPS RT-PCR as the reference, there were

122

104 PCR positive samples and 327 negative patients, including

123

125 pediatric (age 5-17 years (average 11.3 years)) samples. The

124

observed RT-PCR positive results were divided into groups according

125

to the number of days after the onset of symptoms: 0-14 days (22

126

patients); 15-30 days (52 patients); 31-70 days (20 patients) and

127

10 asymptomatic patients. The results of the comparison of the

128

mentioned subgroups are presented in Table 4.

129

Sensitivity and specificity for the respective groups were: for 0-14

130

days 90% (95%CI 68.3%-98.7%) and 100% (95%CI 22.4%-100%);

131

for 15-30 days 64.7% (95% CI 46.5%-80.3%) and 83.3% (95%CI

132

58.9%-96.4%); for 31-70 days 71.4% (95%CI 29.0%-96.3%) and

133

84.6% (95%CI 54.6%-98.1%); for

134

29.0%-96.3%) and 66.7% (95%CI 0.8%-90.6%). The mean Ct values

135

for the groups were 33.9 for NPS and 33.8 for saliva (0-14 days), 34.8

136

for NPS and 34 for saliva (15-30 days), and 36.5 for NPS and 39 for

137

saliva in the asymptomatic patient group.

138

Pooling of saliva

139

To evaluate the testing of pooled saliva samples, 37 pools were

140

constituted. There were 15 pools of 5 samples (4 negatives + 1

141

positive), 13 pools of 10 samples (9 negatives + 1 positive), and

142

9 pools of 20 samples (19 negatives + 1 positive). The RT-PCR testing

143

for each pool was repeated twice. The total number of measurements

144

was 74. All results were 100% positive.

145

When using pooling, the number of tests needed per sample was

146

calculated as follows: the total number of tests needed to test all

147

samples is divided by the total number of samples. For example, if

asymptomatic 71.4% (95%CI

148

500 samples are being tested in pools of 10, it means 50 tests are

149

initially needed. With a positivity rate of 1%, a maximum of five pools

150

will contain a positive specimen (if each positive sample is in a

151

different pool). The 50 samples from these five pools will have to be

152

retested individually (each of the five positive pools contains 10

153

samples). Therefore, a total of 100 tests are needed to evaluate all

154

500 samples and the number of tests per sample is 100/500 = 0.2.

155

The positivity rate in Latvia on September 23, 2020, was 0.5%.

156

The approximate positivity rate at which the pooling of 5 samples

157

becomes more efficient than the pooling of 10 samples is 3% (2-4%

158

depending on test price, laboratory load, tests per sample).

159

Field study

160

To evaluate the convenience of saliva pool testing by RT-PCR in field

161

conditions, the town of Kuldiga (total population 10,352) with an

162

ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in a textile factory was selected. In

163

collaboration with local authorities, 4,100 saliva self-sampling kits

164

were distributed to inhabitants at a specially established distribution

165

point. There were four persons dedicated to the distribution of the kits

166

and four drivers to deliver the samples by car to the testing laboratory

167

in Riga (150 km one way). During the study period, 3,660 saliva

168

samples were collected (response rate 91.5%), delivered to the

169

laboratory, and tested in pools of 10 samples. There were a total of

170

366 pools. In the first round of testing 43 pools were found to be

171

positive and samples from these pools were re-tested individually. The

172

saliva samples from 44 patients were confirmed as positive by RT-

173

PCR. Mean Ct values of pooled samples were 13% higher than

174

individually tested Ct (31.6 versus 27.6). The positivity rate of the

175

tested population was 1.2%. In total 796 RT-PCR tests were

176

performed. At the time of the sample collection, 68.2% (30/44) of

177

patients did not report any symptoms on the questionnaire form.

178

Nasopharyngeal swab tests and saliva tests were compared with the

179

number of new COVID-19 cases. The findings illustrate that the

180

second peak in new cases occurred 6-7 days after the initial peak. Such

181

findings correspond with the mean incubation period of the SARS-

182

CoV-2. The results reflect a decrease in new cases in the following

183

observation period (Figure 1).

184
185

Discussion

186

The findings of our study can be summarized as follows: (a) for the

187

detection of SARS-CoV-2, saliva is a stable specimen with acceptable

188

specificity and sensitivity at the early stages of infection; (b) saliva

189

specimen is appropriate for pooling, with accurate diagnostic

190

performance.

191

Saliva has been identified as a reliable testing specimen for SARS-

192

CoV-2 using the RT-PCR approach in several recent studies (7–9). In

193

the updated European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control

194

(ECDC) recommendations, saliva is also mentioned as a convenient

195

specimen for SARS-CoV-2 testing (10,11). The FDA has approved

196

methods for SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva in several laboratories

197

(12,13). Nevertheless, saliva has been included in IFCC COVID-19

200

The high expression of ACE2 receptors in salivary gland cells is the

201

main factor for virus affinity that could lead to active replication and

202

transmission by saliva droplets expelled into the air during coughing

203

or sneezing (15,16).

204

It is essential to establish standardized sample collection procedures,

205

safe logistics, and reliable testing methods that meet performance

206

requirements. Our stability testing confirmed that saliva samples

207

stayed equally positive up to 24h.

208

In the analytical context, saliva can have the same or even better

209

performance than NPS (17). It has been previously confirmed to be

210

highly sensitive and specific at the early stage of infection 0-14 days

211

after onset of symptoms and in asymptomatic cases (17,18). Therefore,

212

it is essential to take into consideration the relationship between the

213

dynamics of viral load, Ct values, and the number of days after the

214

onset of symptoms. As described in prior publications, the Ct value is

215

important in determining the infectiousness of a patient sample. Ct

216

values above 34 do not emit infectious virus particles, and values

217

between 27-34 show low viability of the viral load. Samples with a Ct

218

value of 13-17 show positive virus viability (19). Ct values may vary

219

depending on the different assays by up to 5 cycles for the same sample

220

(20). Variation also appears due to the quality of the specimen obtained

221

and the different treatment methods used to prepare samples for testing

222

(21). As expected, we got some variation between the NPS and saliva

223

sample types. In our pilot testing using 44 positive saliva samples we

224

found slightly higher (13%) Ct values in pools, compared to individual

225

tests. Similar findings have been published by other researchers (22).

226

This observed slight difference still allows for the safe use of saliva

227

pooling for surveillance purposes with sufficient diagnostic accuracy.

228

Nevertheless, pooling strategies are described in the latest update of

229

COVID-19 testing strategies and objectives published by the ECDC

230

(11). There is evidence of benefits from pooling in low prevalence

231

countries with a low proportion of positive samples – up to 5%. Recent

232

publications indicate that for populations with a prevalence of less than

233

1% the testing of saliva pools of 10 or 20 samples is more beneficial,

234

and our independent calculations also bear this out. Comparing the

235

correlation between different pool sizes (usefulness and efficiency)

236

with test positivity rate, we concluded that a pool size of 10 is more

237

efficient than a pool size of 5. The calculations are based on test price,

238

reimbursement conditions, and the number of tests per sample (when

239

using a pooling strategy) (23,24).

240

The pooling strategy for self-collected saliva samples is the optimal

241

solution that saves resources and reduces the testing time (25). In our

242

real-life field test on a “perifocal” population, we successfully tested

243

nearly a third of the citizens of the town of Kuldiga in three days. This

244

allowed for fast identification of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases

245

and those with mild symptoms to enable timely contact tracing and

246

outbreak containment. The use of nasopharyngeal swabs in such a

247

situation would have required more staff and time with possible patient

248

compliance issues.

249

Additionally, improvements may reasonably be expected in terms of

250

organizing the distribution of self-sampling kits to patients as well as

251

the logistics of returning the kits to the laboratory that would further

252

increase the usefulness of screening using a pooled testing strategy.

253

There were some limitations in our study: the size of the cohort of

254

participants was limited, the selected laboratory-developed RT-PCR

255

method for evaluation was used, also a lack of multicenter observation.

256

Future studies extending the cohort are needed to confirm current

257

findings and provide the implications in clinical practice.

258
259

Conclusions

260

Our findings confirm the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva,

261

showing acceptable performance in terms of specificity and sensitivity

262

at the early stages of infection, and the advantages of testing using a

263

pooling strategy in a low prevalence population. Ct values and

264

detected/missing gene information are favorable for the interpretation

265

of the results from several aspects, e.g. epidemiological investigation,

266

determination if the patient is infectious at the current stage, etc. Self-

267

sampling makes the procedure faster, safer, and requires fewer

268

resources. The targeted distribution of test kits among a population

269

with a known outbreak significantly increased the positivity rate.

270

Saliva pool testing on a large scale provides an additional tool to take

271

timely measures and contain outbreaks.
