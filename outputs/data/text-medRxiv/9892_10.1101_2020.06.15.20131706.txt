Abstract
Background:
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an abrupt response by the host immune system, which is largely responsible for
the pathogenesis and outcome of COVID-19. We aimed to investigate which specific responses from either
cellular or humoral immunity associate to severity and progression of COVID-19.
Methods:
A cohort of 276 patients classified in mild, moderate and severe, was studied. Peripheral blood lymphocyte
subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by
nephelometry.
Results:
At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion
of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and
circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When
degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by
complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells,
which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild
and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from
day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were
discharged earlier.
Conclusion:
Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which
is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity. This study associates
for the first time COVID-19 severity with an imbalanced humoral immune response characterized by excessive
consumption of IgG and C4, identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Introduction
Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is either
asymptomatic or presents with mild symptoms in a majority of individuals. However, up to 20% patients
develop a severe form of the disease with pneumonia, which in some cases results in acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and requires invasive mechanical ventilation. ARDS, together with myocardial damage, are
main causes of mortality in COVID-19(1).
A pathogenic hallmark of ARDS is the disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier and a subsequent increase in
permeability, which has been partially attributed to a maladaptive immune response. Thus, lung alveolar
macrophages may be infected by the virus and become activated, leading to a cytokine release syndrome,
which contributes to endothelial injury with the recruitment and activation of innate and adaptive immune
cells and the extravasation of plasma components of the humoral immunity(2).
Humoral immunity against viruses plays a key role in the control of initial infection and cell-to-cell spread. It is
mediated by the complement system and the immunoglobulins (Ig)(3, 4). Antibodies of the IgM isotype
efficiently activate the classical cascade of complement, which is one of the most effective arms of the host
defense against viruses. Secreted IgA antibodies neutralize viruses within the mucosa of the respiratory and
gastrointestinal tracts. Finally, antibodies of the IgG isotype opsonize viral particles and mediate their
clearance by phagocytes or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Isotype switching and affinity
maturation of antibodies, as well as the generation of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, are B cell
responses driven by helper T cells, in particular follicular helper T cells (Tfh).
Different SARS-CoV-2 components such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and N protein,
together with C reactive protein (CRP) from plasma, may activate either the alternative or the lectin pathways
of the complement cascade early during infection(5). In a more advanced stage of the disease, specific antiviral Ig and immune complexes may trigger the classical pathway of complement system, or bind Fc receptors
on NK and phagocytes. NK cells are major innate immunity mediators during the anti-viral response, since they
kill infected cells through different mechanisms, including ADCC, mediated by FcgRIIIA (CD16) binding to
clustered IgG displayed on cell surface of virally infected cells(6).
However, deregulated humoral immune response can damage host tissues. Complement-mediated tissue
injury is elicited by an intense inflammatory loop secondary to C3a- and C5a-mediated recruitment and
activation of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and platelets. Phagocytes in turn generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases, and neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),
which exacerbate tissue damage(7-10).
Several studies on SARS-CoV2 infection have attempted to elucidate phenotypic features of immune cell
subsets either associated with severity or predictive of disease outcome. However, these studies have been
conducted, in most cases, with a limited number of patients, and clinical parameters and disease severity are

not homogeneously recorded in all of them. Likewise, although specific antibodies and complement activation
have been proposed to mediate some of the most severe complications of coronavirus infections, including
that of SARS-CoV-2(2, 5, 11, 12), solid evidence on the role of humoral immunity effector mechanisms in the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS is clearly needed.

Results
COVID-19 patients have increased B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood
Our cohort of COVID-19 patients included 276 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals who were further classified
according to the severity of their clinical signs and symptoms in mild, moderate and severe, following recently
described criteria(13). Table 1 shows their main demographic and laboratory characteristics. The median
(percentile 25 and 75) age was 63 (53.25-75), 163 (59.05%) were men. The mean duration of symptoms before
admission was 7.36 ± 5.2 days.
We conducted an initial analysis following the COVID-19 admission protocol, which comprised the
quantification of the main peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, including T, B and NK lymphocytes as well as
plasma cells, by multi-parametric flow cytometry (Fig.1A, Suppl. Fig 2). The proportion of T lymphocytes (either
CD4+ or CD8+) and NK cells was similar in all the patients and healthy volunteers, with the exception of CD8+
T cells, which appeared decreased in severe patients (Fig.1B). Conversely, the percentage of B cells was higher
in COVID-19 patients and increased with disease severity, raising from a mean of 9.15% in healthy donors to
20.49% in severely ill patients. In accordance, plasma cells were remarkably higher in patients, both in relative
and absolute values (mean 1.51% vs 17.98%; and 2.83 cells/ul vs 27.37 cells/ul, respectively). This increase in
absolute plasma cell number is of special relevance, given the lymphopenia present in COVID-19 patients
(Table 1), and the diminished absolute number of other lymphocyte subsets (Fig.1B). The elevated number of
plasma cells suggested a redistribution of the main maturation stages of the B lineage, including naïve,
transitional, unswitched memory, IgM-only memory and class-switched memory B-cells, which were identified
in a subgroup of 84 patients from our initial cohort, with the gating strategy shown in Suppl. Fig 1. In COVID19 patients, the proportion of IgM-only memory B-cells increased, while unswitched memory cells decreased
(Fig.1C). This redistribution was more marked in mild patients and progressively diminished in moderate and
severe patients. Nevertheless, differences among patients with different severity degree were not statistically
significant (Suppl. Fig 3). No other differences in absolute numbers or percentages in other B-cell subsets could
be observed between healthy donors and COVID-19 patients.

Increased T follicular helper cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients
Given the role of Tfh in maturation and activation of B cells, we tested whether circulating (cTfh) were
increased in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, in accordance with the increased number of plasma

cells. We observed that the cTfh proportion significantly increased with the severity of COVID-19 individuals,
shifting from a median of 0.51 in healthy donors to 1.7 % in severely ill patients. Importantly, the absolute
number remained steady despite the profound decrease of total CD4+ T cells (Fig.2A, Fig.1B). To further
characterize this population, we assessed surface expression of CCR7 chemokine receptor, which has been
related to lower B-cell activation capacity by Tfh(14). We found a significant increase of CCR7 expression in
cTfh cells of patients with moderate to severe disease (Fig 2A). Finally, we found a direct correlation between
cTfh proportion and total B-cells (r 0.33; p= 0.0090), class-switched B-cells (r 0.26, p= 0.0433), and plasma cells
(r 0.33, p= 0.0091) in peripheral blood (Fig.2B).

COVID-19 severity associates to serum levels of immunoglobulins and complement
The high number of plasma cells prompted us to investigate possible alterations in Ig concentrations. At the
time of admission, COVID-19 patients had serum concentrations of either IgG, IgA or IgM isotypes comparable
to those in healthy volunteers (Fig.3A). On the other hand, when patients with different degree of severity
were analysed, we observed that, in severe cases, the levels of IgA and IgM were similar, but the IgG
concentration was decreased, compared to healthy volunteers (Fig.3B). In addition, a direct correlation was
found between IgG (0.37; p=0.0007) and IgA (0.23; p=0.0444) serum concentrations and the absolute number
of plasma cells in peripheral blood, and between IgM levels and total number of peripheral blood IgM- only
memory B-cells (0.36; p=0.0040) in COVID-19 patients. On the contrary, IgG (-0.31; p=0.0147) and IgA (-0.38;
p=0.0021) were inversely related to the proportion of unswitched memory B cells (Fig.2B).
The increase in plasma concentrations of IL-6 and acute phase reactants that characterizes COVID-19 (Table
1) suggested that the concentration of C3 and C4 complement proteins, considered as acute phase reactants,
could also be elevated. Therefore, we measured C3 and C4 levels in the sera of these patients, and could detect
increased levels of both complement proteins (Fig.3A). However, when considering different groups of
severity, we observed that C3 and C4 levels increased in patients with mild to moderate disease, while
returned to levels similar to healthy donors in those with severe disease (Fig.3B). Therefore, in contrast to
other inflammatory parameters such as LDH, ferritin or CRP (Table 1), C3 and C4 values decreased as the
severity increased.
Next, we tested whether the decrease in these components of humoral immunity was actually related to the
severity of the disease in critical patients, or rather mirrored an increased consumption along time. To
investigate this possibility, we collected the blood of a subgroup of 37 COVID-19 patients who were still
hospitalized 10 days after admission and compared it to the initial blood test. We then considered a
hospitalization period longer than 15 days as a readout of the severity of the disease. With this approach, we
observed that antibodies of the IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes as well as C3 and C4 complement proteins were
similar in all patients at the time of admission (Fig.4A). However, after 10 days, the concentration of IgG in

serum was significantly lower in patients hospitalized longer than 15 days, whereas levels of IgA and IgM did
not change over this time (Fig.4A). Similarly, C3 serum levels were stable over time in both groups of patients.
On the other hand, a significant decrease of C4 concentration was observed after 10 days specifically in those
patients whose severity eventually required a longer stay (Fig.4A). Likewise, plasma cells, but not B
lymphocytes, were significantly reduced in patients with prolonged hospitalization periods (Fig.4B).
The decrease in C4 and IgG serum concentrations in severe COVID-19 cases led us to hypothesize that antigenantibody complexes were forming in excessive amounts and activating the classical pathway of complement
system. Therefore, we quantified immune complexes by enzyme immunoassay in the serum of the SARS-Cov2 infected individuals with different levels of severity, but we did not find detectable levels of immune
complexes (data not shown).

Phenotypic features of NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients
The absence of detectable changes in circulating immune complexes led us to investigate whether antibodies
of the IgG isotype could be indicative of ADCC responses. Therefore, we studied the activation profiles of NK
cells in COVID-19 patients. To this end, a specific panel of antibodies was designed to quantify the main
functional subsets of NK cells (CD56brightCD16-, CD56dimCD16+, CD56-CD16+). Phenotypic analysis showed a
two-fold increase in the proportion of CD56-CD16+ NK cells in severe COVID-19 samples compared to healthy
donors and patients with mild disease (Fig. 5A). This NK subset specializes in ADCC(15), and in accordance to
its activation status, the cells showed a significant downregulation of CD16 expression irrespective of the
degree of severity (Fig.5B). Interestingly, CD16 level in CD56-CD16+ cells inversely correlated to the serum
concentration of IgG in COVID-19 patients (-0.24; p=0.0496) (Fig.2B). Finally, a tendency towards an increased
expression of the cytotoxic marker CD107 was observed in this population (data not shown).

Discussion
It has been proposed that the severity of COVID-19 is related to a dysregulation of the immune response to
SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the immune profile of COVID-19 patients with
different clinical courses. To fill this gap, we have performed a comprehensive characterization of the immune
cells populations and soluble mediators of the humoral immunity in the peripheral blood of 276 patients, who
presented from mild to critical illness in a single centre during the peak of the pandemic in Madrid, Spain.
Plasma cells were significantly elevated in peripheral blood of most COVID-19 patients at the time of
admission. In contrast, Ig levels were similar to those of healthy donors, or even decreased in the case of IgG
in patients critically ill. Since patients were studied at admission, it was feasible that Ig production had not
peaked yet. However, IgG levels decreased further 10 days after admission in patients with longer hospital
stays, which suggests that IgG decrease was rather related to severe disease progression. Three possible

explanations may account for these apparently contradictory observations. The first explanation is a primary
antibody immunodeficiency that debuts with COVID-19. This is supported by the fact that several patients had
very low levels of IgG, IgA and IgM in serum both at admission and after 10 days. We have not addressed this
possibility yet, however we plan to carry out studies aimed at verifying this hypothesis by assessing Ig levels
three months after discharge. Second, it is possible that certain individuals show impaired specific Ig
production after infection secondary to generalized lymphopenia, altered B cell maturation, or patient age.
Regarding impaired specific Ig production, it is known that sepsis triggers immune cell hyperactivity followed,
days later, by immune paralysis, which associates with a poor patient outcome(16). Different mechanisms may
underlie this process, including dysregulation of T cell subsets(17). Isotype switching, which results in the
production of IgA and IgG antibodies, is a feature of germinal centres in lymphoid follicles following the
activation and interaction of specific B cells and Tfh cells by the antigen. Despite the increase in cTfh cells in
COVID-19 patients, cTfh from individuals with moderate to severe disease express higher levels of CCR7, which
inversely correlates with Tfh capacity for activating B cells(18) as CCR7 prompts their retention in the T zone
of the lymph node, preventing their interaction with B cells in the follicle(19). Accordingly, plasma cells
significantly decreased after 10 days in patients with prolonged hospitalization. Further experiments to
analyze Tfh functional phenotype are needed to confirm a Tfh–dependent defective B cell activation in COVID19, and their role in a possible immune paralysis at severe stages of the disease.
Likewise, plasma cell number in peripheral blood decreases with age in healthy individuals(20) (unpublished
data), which could result in a reduced production of specific neutralizing antibodies and contribute to the
severe course in the elderly. Finally, the decrease in circulating IgG could be secondary to its deposit in tissues
where they might activate antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), ADCC by NK cells or classical complement
pathway. Results from our group(21) demonstrate a profound redistribution of inflammatory monocytes from
peripheral blood to the lung where they are probably mediating ADP and tissue injury. Regarding NK cells,
several authors have studied the different lymphoid subsets in COVID-19 patients(22-25) and found no
differences in the proportion of whole NK cells. However, we observed that the CD56-CD16+ NK cells subset,
which has been reported to be particularly efficient at mediating ADCC(15, 26), is greatly expanded in severe
patients and could be therefore related to the IgG consumption. Finally, a clear C4 decrease paralleled that of
IgG in the same group of patients, thus suggesting a continuous or excessive activation of the classical pathway
of complement through specific IgG recognizing viral antigens. The nature of specific antibodies responsible
for the activation of complement requires further research. In this regard, a recent study in a SARS-CoV
macaque model that appeared before the emergence of first cases of COVID-19, demonstrated that a faster
development of neutralizing IgG against SARS-CoV spike characterized animals who developed severe lung
injury(12). Moreover, S glycoprotein-specific Ab responses were higher and peaked earlier in deceased
patients during the first 15 days after the appearance of symptoms, but dramatically dropped 5 days later,

coinciding with clinical deterioration(27). Such timing is similar to that observed in patients with longer
hospitalization periods in our study. C4 consumption may be therefore related to the activation of the classical
pathway through specific anti-viral antibodies or immune-complexes, or to the activation of the lectins
pathway. The absence of significant levels of immune-complexes in sera of these patients does not rule out
their local formation and deposit in the tissues. Interestingly, evidence from autopsies and/or biopsies of
COVID-19 patients suggests that a widespread complement activation could mediate microvascular injury and
leukocyte infiltration, since deposits of different components of the complement system like C5b-9, C4d and
MASP are observed in the microvasculature of the lung or the skin(5, 11).
Quantification of C1q and mannose-binding lectin could further clarify which pathways are responsible for C4
cleavage. Whatever the mechanisms of C4 consumption are, our findings support the idea of complement
being involved in the hyperinflammatory syndrome observed in COVID-19 patients. In this regard, C5a, one of
the main products of the complement cascade activation, is a main proinflammatory molecule, since it has
chemoattractant activity, activates most leukocytes and importantly triggers the coagulation cascade. In
particular, C5a promotes procoagulant activity through several mechanisms, including the induction of tissue
factor by endothelial cells and neutrophils, as well as the upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in
mast cells. In addition, the cytolytically inactive terminal complement complex C5b-9 induces procoagulant
activity through platelet prothrombinase and activates endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and
tissue factor(28-31).
We find our data of particular therapeutic relevance, since different complement inhibitors are currently being
used in the clinics, particularly anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, which has been successfully used in few COVID19 patients(32, 33).

Patients and methods
Study design and population
This is a retrospective observational study including 276 consecutive patients with confirmed detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Hospital Universitario La
Princesa because of mild to critical COVID-19 symptoms, from February 27th to April 29th.

Data collection
Demographic and laboratory data described in Table 1 were collected from electronic clinical records and
included in an anonymized database. Baseline evaluation of immunity was performed around the 3rd day of
admission (median=3 days; percentile 25-75 [p25-p75] 2 to 6). A second evaluation was obtained around the
14th day of admission (median=14 days; p25-p75 12 to 16.5) in a selected group of 37 patients.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection
Samples from nasopharyngeal and throat exudates were obtained with specific swabs as previously
described(34). As first line screening, we performed real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the E gene of SARS-CoV2, with Real Time ready RNA Virus Master on Applied Biosystems TM Quant Studio-5 Real-Time PCR System.
This assay was followed by confirmatory testing with the assay TaqPath™ COVID-19 CE-IVD Kit RT-PCR Applied
Biosystems™ (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), which contains a set of TaqMan RT PCR assays for
in vitro diagnostic use. This kit includes three assays that target SARS-CoV-2 genes (Orf1ab, S gene, N gene)
and one positive control assay that targets the human RNase P RPPH1 gene(35). Determinations were carried
out in an Applied BiosystemsTM QuantStudio-5 Real-Time PCR System (CA, USA).

Sample collection and flow cytometry analysis
Peripheral blood samples from 276 COVID-19 patients were obtained in EDTA tubes for flow cytometry
assessment around the 3rd day of admission. The distribution of the different leukocyte subsets was
characterized by multiparametric flow cytometry within 24 h after extraction. To this end, 200 μL of whole
fresh blood were stained in a BD OneFlow™ LST from BD Biosciences (San José, CA, USA) designed to identify
and quantify the main lymphocyte populations of T (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, gd+), B, and NK lineages.
A subgroup of 84 patients were randomly selected during the period of study for an extensive characterization
of their lymphocyte subsets. These patients, as well as 19 healthy donors, were studied with an extended
panel of multicolor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): anti-CD4 FITC, anti-CD107 FITC, anti-IgD FITC, anti-PD-1 PE,
anti-CD56 PE, anti-CD27 PE, anti-CD38 PerCP/Cy5.5, anti-CXCR5 AF647, anti-IgM APC, anti-CD19 PE-Cy7, antiCD8 APC/H7, anti-CD10 APC/H7, anti-CCR7 BV421, anti-CD16 V450, anti-CD3 V500 from BD Biosciences (USA);
and anti-CD20 V450 from Immunostep (Spain).
Samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the respective mAbs. Then, erythrocytes
were lysed with FACS lysis solution (BD Biosciences) for 10 minutes and after washing with phosphate buffered
saline, samples were analyzed in a FACS Canto II device (BD). At least 100 cells of the less represented subsets
were collected and data were analyzed with the FACSDiva and FlowJo Softwares from BD Biosciences. The
different leukocyte subsets were assigned according to the strategy showed in supplementary Figure 1.
Data are expressed as percentage or absolute number in cells/ul of a given lymphocyte subpopulation. A dualplatform method was used to calculate absolute cell counts. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was employed
to compare the level of expression of certain molecules.

Serum concentrations of immunoglobulins and complement proteins
Serum samples were tested for total IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 concentrations by immunonephelometry
(Immage800, Beckman Coulter, California, USA). In addition, 19 serum samples from healthy donors obtained

during the same period time were used to determine the variability of Ig and C3 and C4 levels in normal
conditions. The absence of SARS-Cov-2 infection in healthy donors at the time of extraction was confirmed by
retrospective determination of specific antibodies. The presence of circulating immunocomplexes was
assessed with C1q CIC ELISA Kit (INOVA, San Diego, USA) following manufacturer´s instructions.

Statistics
Descriptive results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median and percentile 25-percentile
75 (p25-p75), as appropriate, while qualitative variables are presented as frequency (n) and relative
percentages of patients (%). The unpaired, two-tailed, Student t-test was used to compare two independent
groups and the paired Student t-test, to analyse two related samples. One-way ANOVA was employed to
compare more than two groups and post-hoc multiple comparisons were made with Tukey’s test. Spearman
bivariate correlations were performed between serological quantitative markers and cell populations and
corrplot R package (available from: https://github.com/taiyun/corrplot) was used for correlation map
graphics. Variables in correlation map were reordered using hierarchical cluster method. The p-values were
two-sided and statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05. To analyse distribution of lymphocyte in
COVID-19 patients and healthy donors, an automated clustering and dimensionality reduction was performed
using viSNE and FlowSOM tools (Cytobank). Population cells were normalized using log transformation for
analysis. Differences in normalized cells between healthy donors and severity groups (adjusted by sex and age)
were assessed with a moderated t-test using limma R package(36). Cell populations that showed significant Pvalue (FDR = 5%) were considered as differentially expressed between groups. Stata v. 12.0 for Windows and
R version 3.5.1 were used for analyses and graphics. GraphPad Prism 4 software was also used for graphics.
Data is presented making specification for p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.001 (***) and p < 0.0001 (****).

Study approval
This study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee (register number 4070) and it was carried
out following the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki. All included patients were
informed about the study and gave an oral informed consent because of COVID-19 emergency as proposed by
AEMPS.
