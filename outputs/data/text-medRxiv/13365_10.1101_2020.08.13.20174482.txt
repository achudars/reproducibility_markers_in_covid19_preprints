Abstract

26

Objectives

27

Healthcare workers face distinct occupational challenges that affect their personal

28

health, especially during a pandemic. In this study we compare the characteristics and

29

outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW).

30

Methods

31

We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients with known HCW status and a

32

positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency

33

department (ED) in New York State. We routinely collect data on occupation and exposures to

34

suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were

35

ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared

36

baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were

37

or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses.

38

Results

39

From March 1 2020 through June 2020, 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+/-19 years,

40

53% male) with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and known HCW status visited the ED. This

41

included 193 (6.8%) known HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) non-HCWs. Compared with non-HCW,

42

HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118/193 vs 1211/2649,

43

P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161/193 vs 946/2649, P<0.001),

44

but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of

45

tachypnea (12/193 vs 426/2649, P<0.01), hypoxemia (15/193 vs 564/2649, P<0.01), bilateral

opacities on imaging (38/193 vs 1189/2649, P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6/193 vs

47

532/2649, P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more

48

frequent in HCW 154/193: 80% vs 1275/2649: 48% p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38/193 20%

49

vs 1264/2694 47%, P<0.001), ICU admissions (7/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001), need for

50

IMV (6/193 3% vs 321/2694 12%, P<0.001) and mortality (2/193 1% vs 219/2694 8%, P<0.01)

51

were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital

52

signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9)

53

than non HCW.

54

Conclusions

55
56

Compared with non HCW, HCW with Covid-19 were younger, had less severe illness, and
were less likely to be admitted.

Introduction
Illness in healthcare workers (HCWs) is of particular concern in light of the coronavirus

60

disease 19 (Covid-19) pandemic. HCWs are often at risk for increased exposure to infectious

61

diseases compared to the general population, and they may serve as vectors for transmission of

62

these illnesses [1]. The repeated exposure to pathogens may also alter the course of infectious

63

disease in HCWs compared to that in the general population. There is currently little literature

64

studying how HCWs with Covid-19 have fared, and whether their course of disease may be

65

different than non-HCWs.

66

In April 2020 a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Report documented that HCWs made up

67

3% of COVID-19 cases in the US, however HCW status was only reported in 16% of cases [2]. In

68

states that reported HCW status of all Covid-19 cases, HCWs made up 11% of cases [2]. In our

69

hospital, routine documentation of healthcare worker status and exposure to patients with

70

suspected Covid-19 was added to the emergency department (ED) patient intake form at the

71

end of February.

72

The objectives of the current study were to compare baseline characteristics and

73

subsequent outcomes in adult HCW or non HCW patients with Covid-19 presenting to a large

74

ED, including those admitted to our hospital and those directly discharged from the ED.

Methods

77

Study Design

78

We conducted a structured, retrospective review of all patients presenting to our ED

79

with confirmed Covid-19 based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. This study followed the

80

Strengthening of Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting

81

guidelines for cross-sectional studies [3]. We also followed the recommended methodology of

82

Kaji et al. for retrospective chart reviews [4]. We received IRB approval with waiver of informed

83

consent due to the retrospective nature of this study.

84

Patients and Setting

85

Our hospital is a 650 bed, suburban academic tertiary-care hospital located

86

approximately 60 miles from Manhattan. Patient volume is approximately 110,000 adult and

87

pediatric patients per year. Eligible patients presented from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020

88

and included all patients over 18 years of age with Covid-19 confirmed by a positive SARS-Cov-2

89

PCR. In our ED we routinely collected data on patient occupation and exposure to suspected

90

Covid-19 throughout the study period. Patients without information regarding whether they

91

were HCW or not were excluded.

92

Data Source and Collection

93

Data included in our analysis were either automatically extracted from the electronic

94

medical record (e.g., vital signs and laboratory results) or were abstracted through manual

95

chart review (e.g., symptoms and HCW status). Specific data extracted included demographics,

96

past medical history and comorbidities based on patient report, baseline vital signs, symptoms

97

at presentation, laboratory test results, radiological findings, treatments, and outcomes (e.g.,

98

disposition, need for IMV, and mortality).

99

We defined all study data and variables prior to initiating the study and trained our data

100

abstractors using a library of definitions. Healthcare workers included physicians, nurses,

101

technicians and any other support staff that come into direct contact with patients. Hypoxemia

102

was defined as an oxygen saturation less than 94% while tachypnea was defined as a

103

respiratory rate greater than 24/min. We periodically monitored data collection and

104

determined the inter-observer agreement on the primary and secondary outcomes on a

105

randomly selected sample of 20 study patients. Interobserver agreement (Kappa statistic)

106

ranged from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.67-0.99) to 1.0.

107

Study Outcomes

108

The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission,

109

need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

110

Data Analysis

111

Discrete data are summarized as numbers and frequencies for nominal data and

112

compared with Chi-square or Fisherâ€™s exact tests (when sample sizes were less than 5).

113

Continuous data are summarized as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with

114

interquartile (IQR) ranges and compared with T-tests or Mann Whitney U tests for normally

115

distributed and skewed data respectively. For all variables and models, we only used the initial

116

findings at ED presentation. Exploratory multivariable analysis of primary and secondary

117

outcomes was performed using potential predictor variables chosen based on biological

plausibility and previous reports such as age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs, chest XR

119

findings, and HCW status. Comparisons between groups were performed using logistic and

120

linear regression for binary and continuous data respectively. Level of significance was defined

121

as a P value of 0.05 or less. Data was analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 27 (IBM,

122

Armonk, NY).

General Characteristics

126

From March 1 to June 30 2020 there were 2,888 Covid-19 infected patients that

127

presented to our ED, of which 2,846 were over 18 years of age. HCW status was unknown in

128

four patients leaving a sample size of 2,842 study patients. Overall, the mean (SD) age for adult

129

patients was 53 (19) years, 1,513 (53%) were male and 1,306 (46%) were white. The total

130

number of patients admitted to the hospital was 1,406 (49%) of which 328 (12%) were

131

admitted to an ICU (either immediately or subsequent to admission to a regular floor). Invasive

132

mechanical ventilation was required in 261/2842 (9.1%) patients and 221/2842 patients (7.8%)

133

died.

134

Univariable comparisons

135

A comparison of patient baseline characteristics based on HCW status is presented in

136

Table 1. Compared with non HCW, HCW were younger (43+/-13 vs 53+/-18 years; mean

137

difference 10, 95%CI 8 to 23, P<0.001] more likely female (61% vs. 46%; mean difference 15%,

138

95%CI 8-23, P<0.001), and less likely Hispanic (12% vs. 36%; mean difference 23%, 95%CI 17-28,

139

P<0.001). HCW were less likely to have comorbidities (33% vs 49%; mean difference 16%,

140

95%%CI 8-22, P<0.01) but more likely to have reported a known contact with a person with

141

Covid-19 symptoms (83% vs 36%; mean difference 48%, 95%CI 41-53, P<0.001) than non-HCW.

142

While no HCW resided in a skilled nursing facility, 11% of non HCW came from a nursing home.

Multivariable Analyses
After controlling for known potential confounders (including age, sex, comorbidities,

176

vital signs, and CXR findings), variables significantly associated with admission included age (OR

177

1.05/year, 95%CI 1.04-1.06), fever (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.57-2.81), tachypnea (OR 6.0, 95%CI 3.56-

178

1.53), hypoxemia (OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.39-1.53) and presence of comorbidities (OR 1.75, 95%CI

179

1.35-2.25 and 4.1, 95%CI 3.0-5.5 for one or more comorbidities respectively). HCW were less

180

likely than non HCW to require hospital admission (OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.92) even after

181

adjusting for confounders (Table 4).

Variables associated with ICU admission after adjusting for confounders were male sex

187

(OR 1.73, 95%CI, 1.3-2.3), tachypnea (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.1-2.13), and hypoxemia (OR 1.08, 95%CI

188

1.05-1.10). Variables associated with IMV were male sex (OR 2.04, 95%CI, 1.48-2.81) and

189

hypoxemia (OR 1.09, 95%CI, 1.06-1.12). Variables independently associated with mortality

190

included male sex (OR 1.97, 95%CI 1.38-2.82), age (OR 1.05/year, 95%CI 1.04-1.07) and

191

hypoxemia (OR 1.09, 95%CI 1.06-1.12). Being a HCW was not associated with increased risk of

192

ICU admission, IMV, or mortality.

Discussion
Our study identifies clear differences in HCWs with Covid-19 presenting to the emergency

196

department compared to non-HCWs. HCW were generally younger and with fewer comorbidities than

197

non HCW. Compared with non HCW, HCW were less severely ill as evidenced by lower rates of

198

tachypnea, hypoxemia, lymphopenia and the presence of bilateral opacities on radiographic imaging.

199

As a result, HCW were less likely to be admitted to the hospital, to require ICU level of care, require

200

invasive mechanical ventilation and to ultimately die than non HCW. This seemingly milder course of

201

disease in HCWs compared to the general population is reported in other studies of Covid-19 in HCWs

202

[5]. Given the large number of HCW in our catchment area and their potential high risk of exposure to

203

Covid-19 [6], it is reassuring to find low rates of severe illness when compared to the general

204

population. In our study we found that being a HCW was not associated with poor outcomes even

205

after adjusting for age and comorbidities.

206

Certain characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 may be attributed to common characteristics of

207

HCWs in general. Although men constitute a larger percentage of total HCWs in the United States,

208

women make up the majority of most types of healthcare occupations including registered nurses,

209

home health aides, medical assistants, and physician assistants [7]. This may be reflected by the large

210

majority of HCW Covid-19 cases in female HCWs. The higher frequency of HCW Covid-19 infection in

211

females and those in the age group 16-44 has been repeatedly found in most studies that report this

212

demographic information [2,5,8-15].

213

Overall, morbidity and mortality studies for HCWs are sparse, however those that exist suggest

214

that HCWs, particularly physicians, tend to live longer than age and sex matched non HCW [16]. While

215

some studies have found that physicians are more likely to have chronic conditions like obesity,

216

metabolic syndromes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, others have found that they are at

217

lower risk for these illnesses [1]. HCWs are also more likely to have come in contact with a sick person

218

because of the nature of their job [16]. This strongly supports the importance of continued use of

219

appropriate PPE for all HCW. All of these factors have the potential to contribute to an altered course

220

of Covid-19 in HCWs.

221

Our study has several notable limitations. Most importantly, our study was retrospective and

222

subject to considerable selection bias and residual confounding. In addition, the number of healthcare

223

workers was relatively limited. We also did not distinguish between various types of healthcare

224

workers based on their specific profession. Furthermore, our study is representative of a single large

225

academic center near the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic and may be less representative of other

226

centers. We also did not control for ethnicity.

227

Conclusions

228

In summary, we found that when compared to adult non-healthcare workers with Covid-19

229

presenting to the ED, healthcare workers with Covid-19 were more likely to have an identified COVID

230

exposure, present less severely ill, and less likely to be admitted to the hospital. Longer term follow-up

231

of HCW will be needed to better assess the risk of HCW.
