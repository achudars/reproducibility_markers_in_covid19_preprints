Abstract
Background: We present data on risk factors for severe outcomes among patients with coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the southeast United States (U.S.).

Objective: To determine risk factors associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission,
and mortality among patients with confirmed COVID-19.

Design: A retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Fulton County in Atlanta Metropolitan Area, Georgia, U.S.
Patients: Community-based individuals of all ages that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Measurements: Demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, hospitalization, ICU admission,
death (all-cause mortality), and severe COVID-19 disease, defined as a composite measure of
hospitalization and death.

Results: Between March 2 and May 31, 2020, we included 4322 individuals with various COVID-19
outcomes. In a multivariable logistic regression random-effects model, patients in age groups ≥45 years
compared to those <25 years were associated with severe COVID-19. Males compared to females
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.6), non-Hispanic blacks (aOR 1.9,
95%CI: 1.5-2.4) and Hispanics (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.5) compared to non-Hispanic whites were
associated with increased odds of severe COVID-19. Those with chronic renal disease (aOR 3.6, 95%CI:
2.2-5.8), neurologic disease (aOR 2.8, 95%CI: 1.8-4.3), diabetes (aOR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.5-2.7), chronic lung
disease (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.3), and “other chronic diseases” (aOR 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3-2.6) compared to
those without these conditions were associated with increased odds of having severe COVID-19.

Conclusions: Multiple risk factors for hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were observed in this
cohort from an urban setting in the southeast U.S. Improved screening and early, intensive treatment
for persons with identified risk factors is urgently needed to reduce COVID-19 related morbidity and
mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Since SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was detected
in the United States (U.S.) in January 2020, it has spread rapidly across the nation with 2.8 million cases
and 130,000 deaths as of July 5, 2020.(1, 2) As testing increases and transmission continues, it is critical
to understand the epidemiology of this disease to inform clinical practice and prevention strategies.
Early data from the US has suggested more severe disease among older persons and those with
comorbidities.(3) The most common comorbidities among US COVID-19 patients include hypertension,
diabetes, obesity, renal disease, lung disease, and immunosuppression.(4-6) In addition, persons who
are non-Hispanic black represent 23% of COVID-19 related deaths where race is known,(7) despite
comprising 13.4% of the U.S population.(8) Although hospitalization rates have been reported as higher
among black patients, results have been mixed when evaluating black race as a risk factor for death
after adjusting for covariates.(9)-(10) To date, there have been limited community-based data from the
southeastern U.S. where a larger proportion of the population is black, and where there is a
disproportionate burden of chronic health conditions and poor access to care.(11)

By August 6, 2020, the state of Georgia had a cumulative estimate of 204895 COVID-19 cases of which
19230 (9.4%) were in Fulton County, with most of these cases residing in the city of Atlanta.(12) Recent
estimates show that Fulton County, with an estimated population of over 1 million persons, has a high
proportion of non-Hispanic blacks (four times higher than the national average), 13.5% of whom are
living in poverty.(8) This epidemiologic context is similar to other jurisdictions in the southeastern U.S.;
however, there have been limited inferential data from population-based cohorts on risk factors
associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality from this region. Therefore, understanding the
clinical disease spectrum and risk factors for severe disease can inform public health programs and

clinical providers in this highly affected geographic region. Here we report on risk factors associated with
hospitalization, ICU admission, and death among COVID-19 patients from Fulton County, Georgia.

METHODS
Design, Setting and Participants
This study was a retrospective cohort study of individuals diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection from March 2 to May 31, 2020, who resided in Fulton County (situated in Atlanta
Metropolitan Area), Georgia. A laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a positive result
of real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or antigen test.

Data Source
Data were extracted from the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SENDSS). SENDSS
is an electronic database developed by the Georgia Department of Public Health that is used to track
patients with notifiable diseases, including case investigation of COVID-19 patients across the state of
Georgia. The extracted data for each case included in this study were: date of first SARS-CoV-2 positive
specimen collection, age, gender, race and ethnicity, medical comorbidities, residence in a long-term
care facility (LTFC), hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. “Other chronic
diseases” was a variable in SENDSS used to encompass other comorbidities not itemized. Where
applicable, dates related to hospitalization, discharge and death, as well as length of stay in the ICU, and
type of respiratory support in the ICU (invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation) were also extracted and used to determine hospitalization or ICU admission status for
records with missing data.

In order to have complete case investigations and reporting to the surveillance system, we censored the
cohort follow-up time to May 31, 2020. We allowed for a 20-day lag to June 20, 2020, for completion of
case investigations in SENDSS before extracting the data for analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous
variables and as frequencies with proportions (%) for categorical variables. In standard regression
analyses, the assumption is that the individual observations are independent of each other. However,
this assumption is not always tenable, especially in congregate settings like LTCFs where infections are
correlated. Clusters of cases from LTCFs have been shown to contribute to high proportions of
hospitalizations and COVID-19-related deaths.(13) Therefore, in order to account for correlations within
LTCFs, we used random effects models.

We fitted logistic regression random effects models for each variable and outcome, with LTCFs as
random effects. Variables from the unadjusted random effects models that were statistically significant,
i.e., null value of the odds ratio (OR=1.0) not contained within the 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and
race/ethnicity as a priori, were included in the multivariable random effects models. In the multivariable
random effects models we obtained adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% CI for factors associated with
hospitalization, ICU admission, death (all-cause mortality), and severe COVID-19 – a composite of
hospitalization or death.

We further fitted a multivariable logistic regression random effects model that included race/ethnicity
and gender as an interaction term. We used the likelihood ratio test to test if there was evidence of
interaction between these two variables in the severe COVID-19 random effects model.

To account for missing covariate and outcome data, we analyzed missing data for each covariate as an
unknown category. We further performed a sensitivity analysis where we replaced all participants with
“unknown” information on comorbidities with “no” to bias away from the observed effect and then
fitted a multivariable logistic regression random effects model for risk factors associated with severe
COVID-19. In order to determine if missingness for outcome data was random, we also fitted
multivariable logistic regression random effects models that compared (i) age (as a continuous variable)
among those with missing outcome data with those without missing outcome data, and (ii) gender
among those with missing outcome data with those without missing outcome data.

A two-sided p-value of <0.05 or null value not contained within the 95% CI were considered as
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed in Stata software version 15.1 (Stata Corp,
College Station, Texas, U.S.), unless otherwise stated.

Ethical Considerations
This activity was determined to be consistent with public health surveillance activity as per title 45 code
of Federal Regulations 46.102(l)(2). It was approved by the Emory University institutional review board
with a waiver of informed consent.

RESULTS
Between March 2 and May 31, 2020 there were 2820 individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection
with hospitalization-related information (yes, no) available (median age 54 years, IQR 37-69; range 0104 years; 52.0% female); 1650 patients with ICU-related information available (median age 51 years,
IQR 36-65; range 0-103 years; 50.8% female), and 1969 patients with mortality-related information

available (median age 56 years, IQR 38-70; range 0-104 years; 50.6% female). There were 2,851 patients
with either hospitalization or mortality-related information available, of whom 949 (33.3%) had severe
COVID-19.

We found no statistical difference in age or gender between those with missing information and those
with available hospitalization-related information (OR for age 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.0; OR for gender 1.0,
95%CI: 0.9-1.2); available ICU-related information (OR for age 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.0; OR for gender 1.0,
95%CI: 0.9-1.2); available mortality-related information (OR for age 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.0; OR for gender
1.2, 95%CI: 1.0-1.3). We therefore excluded cases that had missing outcome information in our analyses
and assumed that they were missing at random.

Characteristics of COVID-19 Cases
Among the 2820 patients with available hospitalization-related information, 888 (31.5%) were
hospitalized; of those who were hospitalized, 440 (49.5%) were >65 years old, 473 (53.3%) were male,
and 632 (71.2%) were non-Hispanic black (Table 1). Of the 1650 patients with available ICU-related
information, 239 (14.5%) were admitted to ICU; of these, 131 (54.8%) were >65 years old, 150 (62.8%)
were male, and 180 (75.3%) were non-Hispanic black. Of the 1969 patients with mortality-related
information available, 295 (15.0%) had died as of May 31, 2020; of those who died, 239 (81.0%) were
>65 years old, 163 (55.3%) were male, and 219 (74.2%) were non-Hispanic black (Figure 1, Table 1).

Risk Factor Analysis
In the unadjusted random effects models, age (≥25 years for hospitalization, ≥45 years for ICU
admission, and ≥55 years for death), male gender and non-Hispanic black race were all significantly
associated with being hospitalized, admitted to ICU. Similarly, age (≥25 years for hospitalization, ≥45

years for ICU admission, and ≥55 years for death) and male gender were associated with death, in
exception for non-Hispanic black race which was not associated with death but was included in the
multivariable models a priori (Table 1). Statistically significant associations with hospitalization, ICU
admission, and death were found with the following comorbidities: chronic renal disease, neurologic
disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised, chronic lung disease, and “other
chronic diseases” (Table 1).

In the multivariable random effects models, we found that older patients were more likely to be
hospitalized (age categories ≥25 years), admitted to ICU (age categories ≥55 years), die (age categories
≥65 years), or have severe COVID-19 (age categories ≥25 years) compared to those <25 years (Figure 2).
Each 10-year increment in age was associated with a progressive increase in odds of hospitalization or
severe disease. Even persons 45–54 years old had 3-fold higher odds of hospitalization or severe COVID19 disease compared to persons under age 25 after adjusting for covariates.

Males were more likely to be hospitalized (aOR 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2-1.7), admitted to the ICU (aOR 2.1,
95%CI: 1.6-2.9), die (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.4) or have severe COVID-19 (aOR 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1-1.6)
compared to females (Figure 2).

Patients who were non-Hispanic black (aOR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.6-2.6) and Hispanic (all races) (aOR 1.9, 95%CI:
1.3-2.7) were more likely to be hospitalized compared to patients who were non-Hispanic white (Figure

2). Similarly, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic cases had 2.8 and 3.0 higher odds of ICU admission, and
1.9 and 1.7 higher odds of severe COVID-19 disease, respectively, compared to non-Hispanic white
cases. Non-Hispanic blacks also had 1.7 higher odds of death compared to non-Hispanic whites. This
increase in the aOR for death to 1.7 for non-Hispanic blacks compared to the unadjusted OR of 1.4

indicates evidence of positive confounding by the adjusted covariates. Patients who were non-Hispanic
Asian were more likely to be admitted to ICU (aOR 3.3, 95%CI: 1.3-8.7) compared to non-Hispanic
whites, but their small numbers precluded estimates for other outcomes.

The composite outcome of “severe COVID-19” (Figure 2d) was more likely among patients with chronic
renal disease (aOR 3.6, 95%CI: 2.2-5.8), neurologic disease (aOR 2.8, 95%CI 1.8-4.3), diabetes (aOR 2.0,
95%CI: 1.5-2.7), chronic lung disease (aOR 1.7, 95%CI: 1.2-2.3), or those with “other chronic disease”
(aOR 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3-2.6) compared to those with no reported comorbidities.

We found evidence of interaction between race and gender in a random effects model that adjusted for
age categories, gender, chronic renal disease, neural disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease,
immunocompromised state, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and "other chronic diseases”.
The odds of non-Hispanic black males having severe COVID-19 compared to non-Hispanic white males
(aOR 3.5, 95%CI: 2.3-5.3) were higher than the odds of non-Hispanic black females having severe COVID19 compared to non-Hispanic white females (aOR 1.6, 95%CI: 1.1-2.4) (likelihood ratio test for
interaction, p <0.001).

In the sensitivity analysis, we found that each age group ≥25 years, male gender, non-Hispanic blacks,
Hispanics (all races), having chronic renal disease, neurologic disease, diabetes, and having “other
chronic diseases” all remained significantly associated with increased odds of having severe COVID-19
(Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
By July 2020, over 100,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Georgia, suggesting that at a
minimum, 1% of the population, and more likely 10% if we account for non or underdiagnoses, has been
infected with SARS-CoV-2 in less than six months since the first case was reported.(14) In this study, we
examined risk factors associated with hospitalization, ICU admission and death due to COVID-19 disease
in Fulton County, Atlanta Metropolitan Area - the urban center of Georgia. We found that older age,
male gender, black race and Hispanic ethnicity were consistently associated with these severe clinical
outcomes, even after adjustment for comorbidities in multivariable analysis. Further, we found
comorbid illnesses of diabetes, chronic renal disease, neurologic disease, chronic lung disease and other
chronic disease were independently associated with the composite outcome of severe COVID-19
disease. These data provide valuable insights from the largest cohort of patients from the Southeast
U.S., a region with rapidly rising rates of COVID-19, historically limited healthcare infrastructure, and
widespread health disparities. Patients with these risk factors may benefit from proactive screening,
higher prioritization for testing (if testing is limited), and earlier interventions to reduce morbidity and
mortality from COVID-19.

At each step in the COVID-19 disease cascade (i.e., hospitalization; ICU; and death), we found a
disproportionate burden among non-Hispanic blacks. Although they comprised 41% of all confirmed
COVID-19 cases in Fulton County, 58% of cases that were hospitalized are black, and 73% of those who
died are black. Importantly, the increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, or death among nonHispanic black compared to non-Hispanic white patients is independent of age or co-morbid medical
conditions. This difference was most pronounced among black men, who were at 3.5 times greater risk
of having severe COVID-19 disease, though black women were still 1.6 times more likely than white
women to have severe disease. We were unable to ascertain reasons for this. However, extensive

research has demonstrated differences in health access and utilization as factors associated with poor
outcomes for other infectious and chronic diseases in this population. Persons of Hispanic ethnicity
similarly had a higher risk for severe disease; the smaller number of individuals in this group should not
preclude public health efforts specifically targeted to diagnosis and prevention in these hard-hit
communities. Indeed, persons of color may be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure due to overrepresentation as workers in frontline industries.(15) Our findings add to literature from other parts of
the U.S.(10, 16) that have highlighted racial disparities in COVID-19, but provides unique insights from
an urban setting where COVID-19 outcomes have been better than what has been reported in other
settings.(17)

Older age and comorbid medical conditions have been associated with more severe disease.(18-21) We
found that risk of hospitalization and severe disease increased stepwise with every decade increase in
age, with persons 25-34 years having 2-times the risk compared to those under age 25 years. Among
persons 65 and older, the risk of severe disease was 8-15 times greater than among younger persons;
this age group accounts for more than two-thirds of all deaths that occurred during the study period.
However, recent shifts in testing have resulted in a rapid rise in case counts among persons who are 2040 years old; by late-June, 2020 they comprised the majority of all diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Fulton
County.(22) Thus, although they may be at only twice the risk as younger persons, this may translate
into a large number of young adults experiencing severe disease. Consistent with trends across the
U.S.,(23) we found a high prevalence of comorbid medical conditions among all COVID-19 cases,
including 11.5% with cardiovascular disease, 8.2% with diabetes, and 7.0% with “other chronic disease”
that were not individually recorded. Persons with diabetes, chronic renal disease, neurologic disease or
chronic lung disease had at least double the risk of being hospitalized or having severe COVID-19 than
those without these conditions, with chronic renal disease having the highest risk among all

comorbidities. Importantly, in the stratified analysis by race/ethnicity, these comorbidities had an
independent effect, not explained by higher prevalence among black or Hispanic individuals.

Limitations
There were several limitations in our analysis. We utilized routinely collected public health surveillance
data, which can have a reporting lag time of several weeks. To minimize this, we censored our data as of
May 31, 2020, to allow sufficient time for complete reporting of key indicators, such as hospitalization
and death. Data were incomplete for race, ethnicity, and comorbidities for persons whom we were
unable to contact to complete a case investigation, which could be due to the absence of contact
information or individuals declining to provide these data to the health department. These individuals
may differ in important ways from those in whom we have complete information, including access to
and utilization of healthcare services. However, our sensitivity analysis to account for missing data did
not alter our results, supporting the robustness of the observed risk. Lastly, detailed information on
clinical presentation and management of COVID-19 patients is not included in the surveillance database,
limiting our ability to evaluate other factors that may be associated with severe disease.

CONCLUSIONS
This study provides important insights into persons who at highest risk for severe COVID-19 disease in
Fulton County – Atlanta Metropolitan Area. With expanded testing capacity and a greater understanding
of COVID-19 pathophysiology and treatment options, these data can help guide public health programs
and clinicians to better target testing and clinical interventions. As growing numbers of young people
are being diagnosed with COVID-19, it is crucial to understand that the increased risk of severe disease
starts as young as age 25 and that action in ensuring social distancing and return-to-work policy
adequately protects this group. Lastly, the overwhelming data suggesting the highest risk of severe

address this population that is simultaneously suffering from systemic inequities in overall health.

aOR: adjusted odds ratio. The adjusted logistic regression random effects model included age

categories, gender, chronic renal disease, neurologic disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease,

immunocompromised, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and "other chronic diseases”, with

long-term care facilities as random effects.

Arrows pointing to the right for age indicate an upper 95% confidence limit that exceeds the odds ratio

of 14.0 on the x-axis.
