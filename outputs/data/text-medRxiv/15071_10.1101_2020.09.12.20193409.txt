Abstract
Background: In December 2019, the first cases of severe pneumonia associated with a new
coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, China. Severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care
was reported in up to 5% of cases. There is, however, limited information available in Mexico.
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, and outcomes
in a COVID-19 cohort attended to from March to May 2020 in our RICU. In addition, we
explored the association of clinical variables with mortality.
Methods: The first consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 3, 2020, to Jun 24,
2020, with confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained.
Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The survival endpoint was
mortality at discharge from the RICU.
Results: Data from 68 consecutive patients were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients survived, and 30
died (mortality: 44.1 %). Of the 16 predictive variables analyzed, only 6 remained significant in
the multivariate analysis [OR (95% confidence interval)]: no acute kidney injury (AKI)/AKI 1:
[.61 (.001;.192)]; delta lymphocyte count: [.061 (.006;.619)]; delta ventilatory ratio: [8.19
(1.40;47.8)]; norepinephrine support at admission: [34.3 (2.1;550)]; body mass index: [1.41
(1.09;1.83)]; and bacterial coinfection: [18.5 (1.4;232)].
Conclusions: We report the characteristics and outcome of patients with ARDS and COVID-19.
We found six independent factors associated with the mortality risk: delta lymphocyte count,
delta ventilatory ratio, BMI, norepinephrine support, no AKI/AKI 1, and bacterial coinfection .

Introduction
In December 2019, the first cases of severe pneumonia associated with a new coronavirus
were reported in Wuhan, China. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has spread rapidly to other countries, causing a pandemic. It binds to the cellular receptors of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to penetrate the cells1. Severe pulmonary inflammation with
exudative diffuse alveolar damage and massive capillary congestion often accompanied by
microthrombi2, which translates physiologically in ventilation-perfusion inequalities, leads to
severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation
in up to 5% of cases3.
The experience with COVID-19 in China, Europe, and the United States has been widely
reported4-8, however, there is limited information available in Mexico and other Latin American
countries. The Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias s (INER), Ismael Cosío
Villegas was declared as a COVID-19 center, and in the beginning of March, the respiratory
intensive care unit (RICU) received the first patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical
manifestations, laboratory data, imaging characteristics, and outcomes in a COVID-19 cohort
attended from March to June 2020 in our RICU. In addition, we explored the association of
clinical, laboratory, and physiologic variables with mortality.

Methods
Patients and setting
The first consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 3, 2020 to June 24, 2020
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive polymerase chain reaction test result from a

nasopharyngeal sample or tracheal aspirate) were investigated. The INER is a tertiary-level
teaching and research hospital that serves the open population of Mexico City and states of the
Republic. The studies were granted exemption by the hospital institutional review boards. The
requirement for informed consent was also waived.
Data collection and definitions
Clinical and laboratory data were obtained upon admission and daily during the patients’
stay in the unit. High-resolution computed tomography was performed in all patients prior to
admission to the RICU. The information obtained was stored in an electronic database.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed in accordance with the
Berlin definition9 and septic shock in accordance with the 2016 Third International Consensus
Definition10. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed in accordance with the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines11. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated as follows: weight (kg)/height (m)2. Bacterial coinfection was defined as a
positive culture and compatible clinical picture. In cases where the cultures were negative, it was
considered on the basis of the presence of persistent fever for more than 48 hours, leukocytosis,
neutrophilia, increased procalcitonin level, and hemodynamic instability. The respiratory
parameters [i.e., static compliance, driving pressure, and ventilatory ratio (VR)] were calculated
using the formulas described in the table 2. The survival endpoint was mortality at discharge
from the RICU.
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive statistics to summarize the clinical data; the results were reported as
medians and ranges. Meanwhile, the categorical variables were reported as frequencies. Odds
ratios (ORs) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The models were fitted with

univariate and multivariate inputs using the potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality: age,
BMI, AKI, absolute lymphocyte count, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, prone ventilation, static compliance,
driving pressure, VR, use of vasopressors, and bacterial coinfection. SPSS version 21 (IBM
Statistics, Armonk, New York) was used to analyze the data. Two-sided p-values of <.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
Univariate analysis of mortality association
Clinical characteristics and laboratory results
Data from 68 consecutive patients admitted to the RICU from March 4, 2020, to June 24,
2020, were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients survived, and thirty died (mortality: 44.1%). Age, sex,
comorbidity, and the clinical symptoms were not associated with mortality (Table 1).
Conversely, the BMI was associated with an increased risk of mortality [OR, 1.10 (95%
confidence interval {CI}, 1.001–1.21, p= .046)].
From the laboratory tests performed, no associations with mortality were found for the
following variables: lactic dehydrogenase level, creatinine level, hepatic test result, troponin
level, fibrinogen level, D-dimer level, total leukocyte count, total neutrophil count, total
lymphocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. The only variable that showed a
significant association with mortality was the

Δ lymphocyte count [OR, .99 (95% CI, .99–1.0);

p=.014], defined as the difference between the total admission lymphocyte count and the total
lymphocyte count in the last evaluation before discharge from the RICU. Based on this result, an
increase in the total lymphocyte count showed a protective effect on mortality.

Cardiovascular and respiratory variables
The systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures was not associated with mortality. However,
norepinephrine support was associated with a significant increase in the mortality risk [OR, 3.4
(95% CI, 1.1–10.4); p=.031)].
All patients received invasive protective mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 4–8
mL/kg of predicted body weight. The monitored respiratory parameters (i.e., static compliance,
PEEP, driving pressure, and VR at admission) were not associated with mortality. Although the
VR at admission showed no association with mortality, the difference between the VR
determined at admission and the VR determined on the last day of invasive mechanical
ventilation showed a significant association [OR, 4.7 (95% CI, 1.8–11.9); p=.001)]. The
PaO2/FiO2 ratio showed a significant protective effect for mortality (higher values were
protective) [OR, .98 (95% CI, .97–.99); p=.037]. Ventilation in the prone position did not show a
protective effect [OR, .38 (95% CI, 0.12–1.10); p=.07)].
Multivariate analysis of mortality association
The variables that showed a significant association with mortality in the univariate
analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Linearity of the continuous variables with
respect to the logit of the dependent variable was assessed via the Box-Tidwell procedure12.
Bonferroni correction was applied using all six terms in the model, resulting in statistical
significance being accepted at p-values of <.008313. Based on this assessment, all continuous
independent variables were found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable. The
analysis of the standardized residuals did not show outliers (greater than ±2 SD). The logistic
regression model revealed significant findings [χ2(4) =48.023, p<.0005]. The model explained
75.1% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in mortality and correctly classified 89.7% of the cases.

The sensitivity was 76.7%; specificity, 78.6%; positive predictive value, 75.8%; and negative
predictive value, 79.3%. Of the 16 predictive variables, only 6 remained statistically significant:
no AKI/AKI 1,

Δ

lymphocyte count,

Δ

VR, norepinephrine support at admission, BMI, and

bacterial coinfection (as shown in Table 2). An increasing

Δ

VR was associated with an

increased risk of mortality; however, an increasing Δ absolute lymphocyte count was associated
with a reduction in the risk of mortality. No AKI/AKI 1 showed a strong protective effect [OR,
.019 (95% CI, .001–.400)]; norepinephrine support at admission and bacterial coinfection were
also associated with a high risk of mortality [OR, 34.3 (95% CI, 2.1–550]; p=.012 and OR, 18.5
(95% CI, 1.4–232); p=.023, respectively]. The area under the ROC curve was .876 (95% CI,
.790–.962), which was an excellent level of discrimination according to Hosmer et al.14

Discussion
In this study, we described the characteristics of a cohort of critically ill patients with
COVID-19 and ARDS and analyzed the factors associated independently with mortality. Our
analyses showed that the demographic, clinical, radiological, and biochemical characteristics are
similar to those reported previously by other groups in China, Europe, and the United States4-8.
Six variables showed an independent association with mortality: Δ lymphocyte count, Δ VR, no
AKI/AKI 1, norepinephrine use, BMI, and bacterial coinfection.
Lymphocytopenia has been described as a marker of the severity of SARS-CoV-2
infection and a predictor of mortality since the first reports in Wuhan, China5,15. In our patients,
the mean lymphocyte count was low in the survivors and non-survivors on admission to the
RICU; however, the difference did not show a significant association with mortality.
Nevertheless, the

Δ

lymphocyte count (difference between the total lymphocyte count at

admission and total lymphocyte count at discharge) showed a strong protective effect on
mortality. Thus, an increase was associated with a decrease in the risk of mortality, while a
decrease was associated with a significant increase in the risk. This result is consistent with the
rapid and dramatic restoration of peripheral T lymphocytes in patients who recovered from
SARS, as reported by Li et al.19. A recent meta-analysis supports lymphocytopenia on admission
as a marker of severity and as a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (17). However,
the results of this study should be interpreted considering that the study only analyzed reported
studies of patients in China, used information from studies without a peer review, and had the
composite outcome that considered not only mortality. Furthermore, a zero time is difficult to
determine because patients are expected to differ in the stage of the inflammatory response
caused by the infection. Based on our results, lymphocytopenia on admission may not be a
reliable predictor of mortality and thus should be used with caution when making decisions. The

Δ lymphocyte count seems to be a better predictor of mortality and could be useful for stratifying
patients when analyzing clinical trial results or as a surrogate biomarker of therapeutic efficacy.
The mechanism of lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 remains unclear; however, several
hypotheses have been advanced to explain its pathogenesis18,19.
Lymphopenia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is the expression of a dysregulated immune
response with a predominance of immunosuppression and is associated with a high risk of
bacterial coinfection, septic shock, organ dysfunction, and mortality20. A dramatic reduction in
the total lymphocyte count and CD8 and CD4 T cell subpopulations to levels similar to those
seen in patients with severe AIDS has been reported in patients with COVID-19 21. Recovery of
the adaptive immune system with an increase in the number of T lymphocytes is necessary for
the elimination of the virus. In this context, the use of steroids can have both favorable and

unfavorable consequences. With an excessive inflammatory response, steroids may reduce organ
damage and may be of benefit in the early stage. However, in patients in whom the
immunosuppression response predominates, steroids would accentuate this response, increasing
the risk of sepsis and mortality; the application of treatments that stimulate the immune system
could be useful in these patients22. In this context, changes in the lymphocyte count could be
used as a parameter for decision-making.
The VR is governed by the production of carbon dioxide (VCO2) and the ventilatory
efficiency [1-(Vd/Ve)] and can be easily calculated at the patient’s bedside using ventilation and
blood gas parameters. It correlates with the percentage of dead space and is also associated with
an increased risk of mortality23. Previous studies on patients with ARDS and COVID-19 have
reported a significant association between the VR at admission and mortality24. In our patients,
we did not observe this association upon admission to the RICU. This disagreement with
previous findings, which indicate a significant association at admission, may be related to the
different zero times in the evolution of the cohorts, as it is difficult to accurately determine the
start time of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions. However, the

Δ

VR showed a strong association

with mortality in our cohort. Thus, a progressive increase in the VR could be considered as a
marker of the mortality risk in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. This result is consistent
with the increase in the fraction of dead space in the first weeks of ARDS as an independent
predictor of mortality, as reported by several studies23,25,26.
In summary, worsening of the VR in our cohort was independently associated with an
increased risk of mortality. Similar to the tidal volume adjusted for the predicted weight, plateau
pressure, driving pressure, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the VR should be monitored on a daily basis and

used to make adjustments to the ventilatory parameters, always taking into account the
aforementioned variables.
Although the PaO2/FiO2 ratio showed a significant association with mortality in the
univariate analysis, the association was not maintained in the multivariate analysis; thus, it did
not represent an independent effect on mortality in our cohort. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is a key
variable for the definition and determination of the severity of ARDS according to the Berlin
definition9. However, in patients with COVID-19, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio has not been shown to be
a strong predictor of mortality, which may be related to the heterogeneity described for ARDS
due to COVID-1927. The majority of our patients showed a ground-glass image on tomography,
without extensive consolidation images, as observable in most patients with ARDS not due to
COVID-19. The main mechanism of hypoxemia in these patients in the initial phase is an
abnormality in the distribution between ventilation and blood flow; the latter is suggested to be
due to abnormal vasoregulation27. This explains the rapid response of many patients to oxygen
administration and the poor response at this stage to recruitment maneuvers because there are no
extensive recruitable consolidation areas. Therefore, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is not a physiological
biomarker of the amount of pulmonary shunt and lung parenchymal damage in the early phase of
ARDS due to COVID-19, which may explain why the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at this stage was not an
independent predictor of mortality.
A high incidence of AKI and associated mortality has been reported in patients with
COVID-19. Hirsch et al. reported an incidence of 36.6% in a cohort of 5449 patients with
COVID-19 and a mortality of 35%. However, in patients with respiratory failure who required
invasive mechanical ventilation, the incidence of AKI was 89.7%; in those who required
hemodialysis, the mortality was 55%28. In our cohort, 74.1% of the patients developed some

12

stage of AKI. Of them, 65.1% developed AKI 1, and only 25% did not present AKI during their
evolution; meanwhile, 34% of the patients developed AKI 2 or AKI 3. The multivariate analysis
showed that not developing AKI or AKI 1 had a strong protective effect on mortality. Thus, the
application of preventive or therapeutic measures (implementation of the KDIGO supportive
care guidelines)11 to avoid AKI or to prevent progression to more advanced stages in patients
with AKI 1 should be a priority in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
Obesity has spread worldwide and is considered a pandemic with high morbidity and
mortality. In Mexico, the prevalence of overweightness has been estimated at 71.2% in the adult
population and that of obesity, defined as a BMI of >30 kg/m2, at 32.4%29. In our cohort, obesity
showed a significant independent association with mortality. However, in patients with ARDS, a
paradox has been reported, consisting of lower mortality in populations with obesity than in
those without obesity30. Our data on COVID-19 contradict this paradox, and there are scientific
arguments to support the pathogenic role of obesity in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1.
Adipocytes activate the inflammatory cascade, which increases the risk of thromboembolism and
susceptibility to the cytokine storm31. 2. Obesity negatively alters respiratory mechanics32. 3.
Alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics in alveolar epithelial cells have been described in
experimental models33, which could increase susceptibility to lung damage. 4. There is an
experimental evidence of a compromise in innate and adaptive immunities owing to obesity34. In
this context, obesity is a public health problem that may be associated with mortality during this
pandemic.
Study limitations
One limitation of the study is the small size of the cohort, which originated from a single
third-level center in Mexico; the results may not then be extrapolated with certainty to other non-

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.12.20193409; this version posted September 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this

similar populations. However, our results are generally consistent with those reported in other
larger cohorts by researchers in China, Europe, and North America.
Although the statistical logistic regression model showed a good discrimination
performance, it should not be used for prediction purposes, as it requires internal and external
evaluations as well as a larger number of patients. However, the association of the independent
variables with the risk of mortality may help in better understanding the pathophysiological
response of the organism to infection by SARS-CoV-2. In subsequent studies, these variables
can be considered as potential predictors in the development of prognostic models.
Some of the strengths of the study are that it investigated a prospective cohort with a
well-defined zero time for each patient and that the data were obtained in real time.
In summary, we described the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics in a
prospective cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and the independent factors
associated with mortality. Based on this information, it is possible to suggest some management
recommendations in patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care; respiratory
management based on low tidal volumes and adjustment of parameters according to the VR,
measures to protect kidney function, adjustment of fluid balance according to volume
responsiveness, avoidance of the use of immunosuppressants in patients who do not show
lymphocyte recovery, strict measures to prevent nosocomial infections, and early detection and
aggressive treatment when infection is suspected, and consideration of empirical antifungal
therapy in patients with persistent lymphopenia and fever are simple measures that can
potentially reduce the risk of mortality until an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2
infection is available.

§Respiratory-system compliance was calculated as the ratio of the tidal volume to the difference
between inspiratory plateau pressure and PEEP
¶Driving pressure was calculated as the difference of the plateau pressure and PEEP
&Ventilatory ratio (VR), was calculated as [minute ventilation (mL/min) × PaCO2 (mmHg)] /
[predicted body weight × 100 (mL/min) × 37.5 (mmHg)]
