Key Points
Convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 is beneficial for those patients with be difficult to turn to
negative or re-positive RT-PCR.
Abstract
Objective To describe the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion for COVID-19 patients.
Methods This is a retrospective study of 6 COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma at Guizhou
Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital

─

a tertial hospital, in Guiyang, Guizhou, China, from January 29, to

April 30, 2020; final data of follow-up was May 12, 2020. Through the review of the electronic medical
records of Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, clinical data of 6 patients were obtained. Three patients with
worsening symptoms after empirical treatment with antivirals were transfused convalescent plasma therapy
for the first treatment, while the other three severe or critical COVID-19 patients with rapid progression
were transfused. The efficacy of convalescent plasma depends on the relief of symptoms, changes in
laboratory indicators and chest imaging abnormalities.
Results The PaO2 / FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2 and 3 treated with convalescent plasma
treatment for the first treatment period were changed from abnormal to normal. The levels of inflammation
markers CRP and IL-6 of the patients decreased significantly. Chest imaging examination showed that the
lung lesions gradually subsided. The relapsed patients (No. 4 and No. 6), after using convalescent plasma
therapy, turned negative on two consecutive throat swab tests on Day 24 and Day 3, respectively.
Conclusions Convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 is beneficial for those patients with be difficult
to turn to negative or re-positive RT-PCR.

Introduction
In December 2019, Wuhan, China, became the center of pneumonia outbreaks caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently
named the condition coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of
June 6, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that globally, the number of COVID-19 confirmed
cases reached 6,807,555, and the cumulative number of deaths reached 396,856. To date, no specific
therapeutic agents or vaccines have been proven effective for COVID-19; supportive care and generic
antiviral drugs are the only available treatments. Although several antiviral agents appear clinically
beneficial, their efficacy is far from satisfactory, and their mechanisms of action remain unclear

.

[2-4]

Ongoing research and clinical trials are investigating the effectiveness against COVID-19 of various
experimental

therapies,

including

Favipiravir,

Lopinavir-ritonavir,

Remdesivir,

Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, IL-6 inhibitors, and convalescent plasma [5].
Convalescent plasma is plasma obtained from a recovered individual after the infection has subsided and
specific antibody has developed. Transfusion with convalescent plasma may reduce the clinical infection or
the clinical severity in patients who have recently been infected with the same pathogen as the donor of the
convalescent plasma

[4]

. Convalescent plasma therapy has a favorable effect on viral load, serum cytokine

response, and mortality. Historically, there have been many successful applications of convalescent plasma
therapy used as post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g., rabies, hepatitis, measles, mumps, and polio) and as
treatment for various infectious diseases administered after infection (e.g., Ebola virus, Middle East
respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, H5N1 avian influenza, and H1N1
influenza)[4-11]. Shen et al. recently reported the preliminary results of five critically ill patients with
COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were treated with plasma from recovered
individuals; they found that about one week after plasma transfusion, the clinical status of all patients

improved, their body temperature returned to normal, and their Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores
and ratios of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2 measured
in mm Hg and FiO2 measured as the fraction of inspired oxygen) had improved as well. Within 12 days after
the transfusion, the patient neutralizing antibody titers had increased, and their respiratory samples tested
negative for SARS-CoV-2 [12].
These limited findings provide encouraging evidence that infusion with convalescent plasma may be
beneficial for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2

. As the current number of COVID-19 cases and the

[13]

number of deaths related to the disease are increasing at an alarming rate, additional research to determine
the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy are urgently needed. The present work
conducted a retrospective analysis to further assess the utility of convalescent plasma as a treatment for
COVID-19.

Methods
Study design
This retrospective, single-center study was conducted on six COVID-19 patients who were treated with
convalescent plasma at Guizhou Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital in Guiyang, Guizhou, China from January
29, 2020 to April 30, 2020. The final follow-up data were collected on May 12, 2020. We obtained written
informed consent from each participant. This study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of
Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry
Center. (CCTR number: ChiCTR 2000033056, registered 19 May 2020. URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/ edit.

Original Research

This study collected data from six patients admitted to Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital with laboratory
confirmed COVID-19 cases based on positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR results from throat swab samples
who had undergone convalescent plasma transfusion. Our inclusion criteria were: patients with a
SARS-CoV-2-positive laryngeal swab AND the rapid development of severe disease while SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR throat swab results remained positive OR worsening symptoms after empirical treatment with
antiviral drugs in recurrent disease (newly positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR throat swab results after negative
results had been obtained). The patients continued to use antiviral drugs while receiving convalescent
plasma therapy.
Clinical information
The clinical data of the six enrolled patients were acquired from a review of the hospital electronic medical
records and included the following information: epidemiology, latency, symptoms, and treatment data. The
baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in Table 1. The clinical indicators assessed before
and after convalescent plasma transfusion included clinical data (PaO2/FiO2) and laboratory data (e.g.,
lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and IL-6 level), as well as any changes in disease
complications. We also examined the length of time between the first SARS-CoV-2-positive laryngeal swab
and the first following SARS-CoV-2-negative laryngeal swab.
Donors and convalescent plasma transfusion
Convalescent plasma was collected from six patients who had recovered from COVID-19; their written
informed consent was obtained prior to collection. The donors were required to: 1) have been asymptomatic
for at least three weeks, 2) be confirmed as negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by two consecutive
RT-PCR tests, 3) be seronegative for HBV, HCV, and HIV based on virus-specific antibody titers, and 4)
have a serum SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA antibody titer of greater than 1:1000 and a neutralizing antibody
titer of higher than 40. Following donation, in accordance with the New Coronavirus Pneumonia

Convalescent Plasma Therapy Guidance of China (2nd edition)[14], ABO-compatible convalescent plasma
from the donors was transfused into the patients on the same day (200 ml each time), which helps maintain
the natural activity of the plasma. Adverse events and serious adverse events related to convalescent plasma
transfusion were evaluated by treatment clinicians.
Role of the funding source
The design, data’s collection, analysis, and interpretation, and draft writing of this report was funded by both

The clinical data were obtained from case records of Hospital Information System (HIS) in Guizhou
Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital, therefore, there are no bias in this study.

Results
Patient characteristics
Of the 146 COVID-19 patients in Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, this study was conducted on six patients
who received convalescent plasma therapy. These patients were not allergic to the plasma contents, were
negative for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, and did not have any
bacterial infections. Among them, three patients rapidly developed severe disease while their SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR throat swab results remained persistently positive, and three patients had recurrent cases with
worsening symptoms after being empirically treated with antiviral drugs. Notably, Guizhou Jiangjunshan
Hospital did not directly receive any COVID-19 patients directly from the community. All patients in this
hospital were first treated in other non-designated hospitals for some time before being transferred to
Jiangjunshan Hospital. Therefore, these patients were already relatively far along in the course of their

illness when admitted to our hospital. Patients 1, 2, and 3 were in the treatment period, and they each had a
disease severity status of critical or severe critical. Their conditions were not improved by general antiviral
therapy, so they were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. Patients 4, 5, and 6 were in recurrence;
regarding their disease severity, two of them were classified as general, whereas the third was critical.
Because of previous treatments, the symptoms, blood cell count, coagulation test results, and biochemical
analysis data upon admission for patients 4, 5, and 6 were mostly normal; however, because the laryngeal
swab test results were still positive for a long time after disease recurrence, these patients were treated with
convalescent plasma therapy. No adverse reactions were observed in any of the six patients during or after
the convalescent plasma transfusion.
Two of the patients were smokers, and two had no preexisting medical conditions. All six patients had been
infected via contact with other patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and had subsequently taken various
antiviral agents and steroids. Most patients experienced cough, dizziness, sputum production, dyspnea,
fatigue, and shortness of breath at the onset of disease. Other common clinical manifestations included fever,
sore throat, and myalgia. Even though fever is considered to be a particularly important symptom of
COVID-19, only one of these six patients experienced a fever. The shortest incubation period was 2 days,
and the longest was 30 days. The interval between the initial admission and the convalescent plasma was
administered is 22 ~ 64 days (Table 1).
Convalescent plasma treatment for the patients with persistent COVID-19
Patient 1 was hospitalized for the first time on February 12 and was directly admitted to Jiangjunshan
Hospital. At admission, her oxygen saturation was 85%, she had a PaO2/FiO2 of 128 (normal range: >300),
and she began receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal catheter. Chest imaging on February 24 showed
multiple ground glass opacities (GGOs) in both sides of the lungs. Her condition worsened, and she
continued to experience respiratory distress and require oxygen supplementation. At this time, although

plasma therapy had been planned for patients, we had not yet obtained convalescent plasma that was
compatible with the patient’s ABO, so her treatment continued with only antiviral therapy. On March 4, her
symptoms and oxygenation were relatively stable. Repeated chest imaging examinations suggested that
there were still irregular patch density lesions in both lungs. Therefore, convalescent plasma was initially
given on March 4, with a second cycle administered on March 5. After the treatment, the patient’s levels of
the inflammatory biomarkers CRP, IL-6, and procalcitonin all decreased. Some resolution of pulmonary
lesions was observed at 3 days after the plasma treatment. Meanwhile, her lymphocyte counts gradually
returned to normal from their previous low levels, but her monocyte count remained high (10.10–12.40;
normal range, 0–7). The interval between administering convalescent plasma therapy and obtaining negative
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results for a laryngeal swab was five days (Table 2).
Patient 2, a 75-year-old severe critical patient, was first diagnosed and admitted to Jiangjunshan Hospital on
February 2. He had elevated levels of CRP (19.5) and IL-6 (18.1), and he was moderately anemic. Chest
imaging on March 1 showed no changes in the multiple GGOs in both sides of his lungs and worse lesions
in the right lower lobe. Secondary fungal infections were also detected. During this period, SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR tests on the patient’s throat swabs continued to yield positive results, and the patient continued to
have moderate anemia. He received an initial transfusion of convalescent plasma on March 3, followed by a
second cycle on March 4. The patient experienced a gradual resolution of his pulmonary lesions after the
plasma treatment (Figure 2), and his CRP level, IL-6 level, and neutrophil count gradually decreased from
their abnormally high values. Additionally, his lymphocyte counts gradually increased from their abnormally
low level, and his monocyte count gradually increased from low to normal. The interval between
administering convalescent plasma therapy and obtaining negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results for a
laryngeal swab was ten days (Table 2).
Patient 3 was admitted to our hospital on February 4. He continued to have a fever (maximum temperature,

38.5 °C) and PaO2/FiO2 of < 300 from February 2 up until he received convalescent plasma treatment on
March 14. A chest CT on March 5 revealed the sustained presence of GGOs in the upper right lung. Before
receiving the convalescent plasma transfusion, the patient’s PaO2/FiO2 was 260; this value rose to 327 only
one day after this intervention. The patient’s body temperature (37.6 °C just before the plasma transfusion)
also returned to normal. It took only two days from receiving the convalescent plasma therapy for the patient
to get negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results from a laryngeal swab (Table 2). Additionally, repeated chest
CT scans revealed that the plaque density lesions in both sides of the lungs gradually disappeared.
Convalescent plasma treatment for the patients with COVID-19 recurrence
Patients 4, 5, and 6 had a recurrence of COVID-19. Because they had received previous treatment, they were
asymptomatic, and their blood cell count and biochemical analysis data were basically normal at admission.
A chest CT of patient 4 revealed GGOs around the right lobe of the lung, whereas the chest CT scans of
patients 3 and 5 were normal. The time intervals from the first admission at which patients 4, 5, and 6 were
diagnosed with COVID-19 to the first negative laryngeal swab test results were 25, 14, and 18 days,
respectively. The time from the first negative laryngeal swab test result to a subsequent positive laryngeal
swab test was 13, 47, and 37 days for patients 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The time between the readmission of
patients 4 and 5 to the hospital and the adoption of plasma therapy was 3 and 6 days, respectively; these
patients received only one round of convalescent plasma transfusion. Patient 6 received convalescent plasma
transfusions on the third and 25th days after re-admission. All patients continued receiving antiviral therapy
while receiving the convalescent plasma therapy. At 24 days after the initial plasma treatment, patient 4
obtained negative results from a pharyngeal test strip. Patient 6 obtained negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test
results on the third day after receiving convalescent plasma. These two patients were discharged after
several consecutive SARS-CoV-2 pharyngeal swab tests produced negative results. As of April 27, 2020,
which was 22 days after patient 5 first received plasma therapy, pharyngeal tests on this patient’s still

produced positive results, so this patient remained hospitalized.

Discussion
This descriptive study was conducted on six cases to explore the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for
treating COVID-19. According to previous experience with convalescent plasma treatment in SARS and
severe influenza[15, 16], the production of endogenous IgM and IgG antibodies peaks at two and four weeks,
respectively, after infection. In theory, it should be more effective to use convalescent plasma as soon as
possible in the early stage of the disease. However, our study differs from previous convalescent plasma
studies on SARS and influenza cases in that we used convalescent plasma during the late stage of disease.
The long interval from disease onset to plasma treatment in our study was dictated by the type of patients
admitted to Guizhou Jianjunshan Hospital; as a tertiary hospital, the admitted patients have been treated
elsewhere before being transferred.
Notably, other treatments may affect the relationship between convalescent plasma and antibody levels, such
as antiviral drugs and steroids[8]. Fortunately, we found that in all six cases, convalescent plasma was still
clinically beneficial. Patient 1 was in critical condition before receiving the convalescent plasma treatment.
While waiting for the convalescent plasma for this patient, we continued to treat her with antiviral drugs and
steroids, which clearly stabilized the disease condition, so these treatments likely also contributed to her
recovery. There has been much debate about the use of steroids, and it has not been used as a routine
treatment from the beginning. Evidence from SARS shows that corticosteroid treatment cannot reduce
mortality and it can delay virus clearance[17]. However, systemic corticosteroids may help treat COVID-19
by reducing the excessive lung damage caused by inflammation[18]. The conditions of the six patients in our
study had all rapidly deteriorated to ARDS, so they were given intravenous methylprednisolone before
convalescent plasma therapy. After patient 1 was given steroid therapy, but before she was given the

convalescent plasma, her PaO2/FiO2 underwent a rapid improvement (from 128 to 247), although it did not
return to a normal level. After the convalescent plasma treatment, her PaO2/FiO2 further increased to 335.
After they were treated with convalescent plasma, the PaO2/FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2, and
3 were close to normal. Additionally, the levels of inflammation markers CRP and IL-6 for these patients
decreased significantly, and chest imaging examinations revealed that their lung lesions gradually subsided.
The autopsy reports for COVID-19 fatalities are very similar to those for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
fatalities; they describe diffuse alveolar injury, exudate, and inflammation[19]. ARDS in these patients is
partially caused by the cytokine storm and the host immune response[20]. Therefore, the anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgM and IgG in the convalescent plasma treatment not only can directly neutralize the virus, but these
anti-inflammatory components can also accelerate the clearance of infected cells to prevent cytokine storms.
It is not surprising that for the patients with recurrence of COVID-19, the minimum time for viral clearance
(as assessed by two consecutive negative throat swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid) after the treatment
with convalescent plasma is 2 days, and the maximum time is 24 days. However, patient 5 has had
consistently positive laryngeal swab test results since receiving convalescent plasma on April 5, 2020 up
through the time of writing, May 20, 2020. One possible reason is that the patient’s basic condition and
immune system have been poor because this patient suffers from high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, and
type 2 diabetes, and the patient has undergone various operations (e.g., cholecystectomy, hysterectomy, and
tonsillectomy). Before infusion of convalescent plasma during the recovery period, his IgM and IgG levels
were abnormally low (0.8 g/L and 5.56 g/L, respectively), and his CD4+/CD8+ ratio was 4.34. Another
possibility is that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in the convalescent plasma treatment were insufficient
to neutralize the virus in this patient’s body. Notably, this patient received only one round of convalescent
plasma therapy, after which he was treated with antiviral drugs and steroids. We speculate that if another
round of convalescent plasma transfusion is given to this patient, the effect of this intervention could be

enhanced, speeding up the time until negative results are obtained for laryngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid. Furthermore, a recent report found that antibodies in convalescent plasma administered during
the recovery period can help maintain a higher antibody titer and increase the host immune response until
the virus infection has cleared[5].
This study was limited by its small sample size. However, our study population was typical of patients in
Guizhou Province, and it included both patients who were treated with plasma therapy during their first
SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 patients who relapsed. Importantly, the treatment of COVID-19
patients with convalescent plasma did not cause any serious adverse effects.
In sum up, six patients with COVID-19 were treated with antiviral drugs and systemic corticosteroids
combined with appropriate rounds of convalescent plasma therapy, after which their clinical conditions were
effectively improved. Thus, transfusion with convalescent plasma is another viable option for the treatment
of COVID-19, especially when used in combination with antiviral drugs and systemic corticosteroids. As
more and more COVID-19 patients have recovered from the infection, convalescent plasma therapy can be
encouraged, and active voluntary donation of convalescent plasma will be greatly appreciated.
