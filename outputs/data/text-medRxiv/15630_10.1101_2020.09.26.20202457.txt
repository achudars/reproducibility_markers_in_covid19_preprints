Abstract: Many complex mathematical and epidemiological methods have been used to model
the Covid-19 pandemic. We took a different approach. Making no assumptions, we simply
plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and
analyzed them using segmented regression. The data fit straight lines with correlation
coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that
school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and
other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down.
Hospitalizations and deaths lagged, but paralleled cases. The graphs, which are easy to read,
have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future
pandemics. Overall three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and
wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.
One Sentence Summary: Regression analysis showed that closing schools, closing bars, and
wearing masks had major effects on infections, hospitalizations and death rates in the US during
the Covid-19 pandemic.

Main Text: As of August 1st, 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has been in effect for about six months
in the US. Infection rates have climbed, fallen and climbed again, as different state governments
ordered interventions to fight the pandemic, rescinded them to open their economies, and then (in
some cases) reinstituted them as infections resurged. In this study, we analyzed the effects of those
interventions using a simple approach. We started by asking if a pandemic in its earliest stages,
when the population is completely naïve, might be described by simple kinetics similar to those that
model chemical reactions in their earliest stages, before the increasing concentrations of reaction
products begin to impinge on the reaction rate. Making no assumptions, we simply plotted the data
for Covid-19 cases in several states in the USA as the pandemic evolved. We confined our analysis
to the USA for several reasons. First, we did not think it wise to compare countries with different
types of health systems. Second, in the absence of a coordinated federal response, different states
made different policy decisions, on different dates; allowing for detailed local comparisons of states
with strict and early lockdowns, states with no restrictions at all, and states with similar policies
implemented at different times. Because of these state-to-state differences, we thought that an
analysis done at the granular state level might be able to distinguish the results of different
interventions from one another, and show which were most effective.
Our earliest plots indicated that the daily increases in cases during the initial days of the pandemic
follow a purely exponential trajectory, regardless of country, state or county. We therefore plotted
the data on a log2 Y axis, choosing log2, rather than the more standard log10, because it makes the
doubling time easy to calculate (e.g. if a plot of new cases per day is a straight line and passes
through three horizontal lines [23] in a period of 15 days, then the doubling time is 5 days. We also
saw that the curves could be rendered as a series of straight lines that visually seemed to “break”
into new straight lines with new slopes that seemed to correlate with changing government policies.
To add rigor to our visual results, we used segmented regression analysis, a statistical method for
determining discontinuous changes in slope. We found, for the first few months of the pandemic,
that the data fit straight lines with R values usually greater than 92% - 99%, and that the breaks
(slope changes) occurred at interesting and revealing intervals. For example, school closings
reduced the rate of infections by half or more, with a 6-14 day delay. Lockdowns reduced the rates
of infections by 2 to 4 fold, with a similar delay. Further actions (such as mandating masks or
closing bars) similarly brought the rates further down with somewhat more variable lag times.
Deaths, as expected, were a lagging indicator, but closely paralleled the other two main parameters
(cases and hospitalizations) about one week later. This method remained useful even in later stages
of the pandemic, as the country began to open up, as it enabled visualization of the effects of
relaxing restrictions, and showed the mitigating effects of late interventions. The graphs, which are
easy to read, show how various individual policy decisions reduced or increased the rates of new
Covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths; and can potentially serve as the groundwork for future
policy decisions during this and future pandemics.
Results:
Outlining the process for one state
We begin here with data from a single state, Maryland (MD), the home of the NIH, where we
assumed we would have access to precise data (an issue with some states). We graphed cases,
hospitalizations and deaths on a log2 Y axis, and applied segmented regression analysis to evaluate
the accuracy of the visually estimated slopes and breakpoints.
Figure 1 displays a progression of graphs for the state from March 6, 2020, when the first three
cases were reported, to April 15th. This simple method appeared to be adequate to model the data
during this initial stage of the pandemic, and revealed some features that were not obvious from

The fact that the inflection points for daily new cases often occur one day before those for total
cases, rather than on the same day, and that the correlation coefficient value (96.99) is slightly
lower than that for total cases, is likely due to the fact that daily new cases have a periodic dip on
Sundays and Mondays, and then rebound slightly as the reporting catches up during the week. This
5
variability results in a greater “fuzziness” that creates an uncertainty in the break points and a
somewhat lower accuracy in the slopes. Nevertheless, the high correlation coefficients suggest that
these slopes are good representations of the trends in the data.

Georgia (Figure 2A) officially closed schools on March 169. However, the 16th was a Monday,
and we therefore chose to specify Saturday, March 14th, as the school closing date, as this was
the first day that children did not attend school. Seven days later, on March 21st, Georgia’s
initial doubling rate of 2.2 days for total positive cases dropped to a doubling time of 3.5 days.
Two days after that, Georgia closed bars and restaurants, and this was followed eight days later

by a second change to a doubling time of 7.6 days. Two days after this second rate drop, the
governor ordered a lockdown11, which was followed by a third decline in the slopes after a lag of
nine days. The observation that each change in doubling times occurred before the next
government intervention suggests that each intervention is followed by its own rate change and
that additional interventions have additional effects.
Two days after this second rate drop, the governor ordered a lockdown11, which was followed by
a third decline in the slopes, after a lag of nine days, to a doubling time of 17.7 days. The
observation that each change in doubling times occurred before the next government intervention
suggests that each intervention is followed by its own rate change and that additional
interventions have additional effects.
Tennessee (Figure 2B) also closed schools on March 14th and saw a twofold drop 8 days later,
the same day that bars, restaurants and non-essential business were closed. This second
intervention was followed eleven days later by another twofold drop in rate. One day after this
second drop, the governor issued a “stay at home” order14, which correlated with a third drop 7
days later.
Mississippi (Figure 2C) was a puzzle at first, because the first rate drop occurred only two days
after the official order to close schools5. Rather than dismiss this as a simple outlier - it was the
only state among the 50 that had such a short lag time - we delved into other possible
explanations, thinking that perhaps we were simply wrong, and some aspect of human behavior
other than school closings was responsible for the first sets of rate reductions. Perhaps,
Americans had simply started going out less, as suggested by the phone mobility data from
Apple, Google and Cuebiq6-8.
However, an analysis of the mobility data for Mississippi in comparison with other states
(Supplemental Figure 1), showed no change in mobility that could underlie Mississippi’s early
rate change. We therefore looked for other factors, and discovered that spring breaks for
Mississippi colleges9 and K-12 schools10 had almost all begun earlier than other states, with
slightly variable start dates from March 6 to March 10. Although the K-12 breaks normally last
only one week, the governor asked schools to extend their spring breaks because of the virus11,
and nearly all of the schools did not go back into session before he officially closed them on the
18th of March5,12. Consequently, the drop in the rate of cases that occurred on March 20th most
likely resulted from the fact that children had stopped attending school 10-14 days earlier, rather
than from the March 20th executive order to close schools.
Thus, for states that separated their government actions by a week or more, we were able to
assess the effects of those actions individually. Closing schools appeared to cut the rate of
infections in half, beginning 8-14 days post-closure, and similarly reduced hospitalizations, but
with lag times 2-4 days longer than for positive infections. Deaths followed suit, lagging an
additional 7-11 days.
Closing bars and restaurants and ordering lockdowns similarly reduced the rates of infections,
with similar lag times. Cumulatively, these interventions resulted in 7-10 fold drops in the rates
of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Nevertheless, even when combined, these effects were
frequently insufficient to result in a steady decrease in the daily tallies of new infections. For that
we needed masks.
Mask Mandates
Although the federal government never mandated masks, and many government officials
continued to eschew them, a few state governors wrote orders for their constituents to wear

The lag times for the effect of masks (16-23 days, as indicated by dark blue bars near the X axis)
seemed somewhat longer than those that followed closing schools, bars and restaurants, or
ordering lockdowns, perhaps because it takes time for people to obtain masks and get into the
habit of wearing them, whereas a school or a business can be closed in a day.
An exception to the effectiveness of mask wearing was seen in New York, which implemented a
mask mandate during its lockdown, when new daily cases were already being cut in half every

The second thing we noticed was that the post-opening surges seemed to be strongly correlated
with the opening of bars. Regardless of the timing or sequence of other relaxations, opening bars
was followed 11-12 days later by surging infection rates. Texas, for example (Figure 4A),
opened many businesses, including restaurants from May 1st to May 18th, with little
repercussions on infection rates. On May 22nd, bars were opened (along with aquariums, zoos,
rodeos, bowling alleys, bingo halls and skating rinks) and 11 days later, infection rates surged.
Arizona (Figure 4B) opened everything over an 8 day period, with bars opening only on the last
day (May 18th). As with Texas, Arizona’s surge of new cases also began 11 days later. Georgia
(Figure 4D) carefully opened its economy over a period of more than a month, with no ill effects
until it opened bars on the last day, along with amusement parks and overnight camping. It saw a
surge starting 12 days later. In Florida each county decided individually when to open, making it
impossible to determine the effect of opening bars in the Sunshine State, but for the other three
states, the lag from opening bars to surges in infection rates was remarkably consistent (11-12
days), with only 1 day’s difference among the three.
Thirdly, the data suggested that the simple combination of closing bars and wearing masks was a
highly effective way to clamp down on surging infection rates. Each of these measures brought
the infection rates down by twofold, for a cumulative reduction of fourfold in new infection
rates. States that implemented both interventions, put surging infection rates into decline. Texas,
Arizona and Florida (Figure 4 A-C) all carried out both interventions, though in different orders.
In all three states, surging doubling times of 9-11 days sank to halving times ranging from 49
(Arizona) to 65 (Texas) days.
In contrast to the other three surging states, Georgia’s governor neither closed bars nor mandated
masks (Figure 4 D). However, he did encourage mask wearing, and several mayors mandated
them for their cities, covering about 20% of the state’s population. This mask mandate was
followed about ten days later by a twofold reduction in the rate of new cases. Nonetheless, new
cases did not go into decline, but instead flatlined. The major difference between Georgia and
the three states that dropped their post-opening surge rates to declining ones is that the more
successful states not only mandated mask wearing, they also closed their bars.
Together the data from these four states suggest that bringing cases down to manageable levels
might not require shutting down an entire economy. The combination of closing schools, closing
bars, and wearing masks may be enough.
Discussion

As countries and states debate the best way to prevent Covid-19 infections, and as they contemplate
re-opening schools in the fall, the analysis of the information thus far gleaned about this new
pandemic is vital to those decisions. There have been several previous attempts to correlate various
government interventions with rates of SARS-Cov-2 infections, and predict which might be most
effective13-18. These studies, however, have mostly taken a global view, and this is not necessarily
the most productive for the US. Although a global view has the advantage of large numbers, it has
the disadvantage of combining disparate interventions, done at different times in different places,
into one global soup, in an attempt to find common themes.
We honed down instead to the granular data at the state - and sometimes city - level, painstakingly
combing governors’ executive orders and press releases (and those of mayors when necessary) to
find examples of states that had implemented each of their interventions sufficiently far apart to
enable us to distinguish the effect(s) of each individual intervention.

A second difference between this and previous studies is the method we used. A maxim among
scientists is to use the simplest method that explains the data. Our decision to plot the data, as they
came, without any assumptions, on a Log2 Y axis, allowed us to see the straight lines in the data,
find the slopes of those lines, and the inflection or “break” points where those slopes changed. The
human eye, coupled with human intuition is a powerful tool, and can guide a simple mathematical
approach. We therefore used segmented regression analysis to test our visually-based hypotheses
about breakpoints, slopes and doubling times. The high R values for the segmented slopes
highlight the accuracy of the visually based breakpoints, despite the variability of the data of new
daily cases known to occur because of the “weekend effect” of low reporting, and of low initial
numbers.
The results, demonstrate that, other than full lockdowns, three government interventions had the
most impact on the rates of Covid-19 infections: closing schools, closing bars and wearing
masks.
Schools: Closing schools not only flattened the early curves of rapidly rising numbers of infections
in March (Figure 2), it prevented a return to those initial rates after states opened up their
economies in mid-summer - a time when schools remained closed (figure 4). This demonstrates that
the effect of a particular intervention lasts as long as that intervention is in place, regardless of other
interventions that might be mandated and/or rescinded.
Although it could be argued that the mid-summer surging rates of infections were lower than the
initial rates in March because of increased resistance in the US population, this is unlikely. At the
time (early to mid-June), the number of confirmed cases in the US – just under 2 million constituted a mere 0.6 percent of the population19. Even if the true infection rate were 8-10 times
higher, as underscored by a recent study20, the increase to 6% would still be too small to account for
the reduced rates of post-opening infections, which closely mimicked the early post-school-closing
rates.
These findings help to resolve the conflicting conclusions of two previous reports. In contrast to
two early predictive models suggesting that closing schools would bring down Covid-19 infection
rates, a study covering the effects of government interventions in six countries21 concluded that
closing schools had no effect in the US. However, the authors analyzed each of those countries as a
whole, which is not useful in the case of the US, which had no national policy on the matter. The
second study22 analyzed individual states, and concluded that closing schools had a major impact.
However, in evaluating all the states together, the authors noted that they were unable to discount
the potential effects of other interventions. Our study, like theirs, shows that closing schools had a
major effect, and supports this idea with the results from the small set of states (Figure 3), where the
effect could not be explained by other interventions.
Bars: The effect of closing and opening bars became evident in those states that opened their
economies in stages (Figure 4). Although most states closed bars and restaurants simultaneously
during their early shutdowns, some opened them at different times during the re-openings. We
found that, regardless of other relaxations, new infections surged beginning 11-12 days after bars
were opened, and fell once again about 8 days after bars were re-shuttered. This suggests that
closing (and re-opening) settings that might not be conducive to social distancing has more
impact on new infection rates than would opening other types of businesses (dog groomers,
markets, hardware stores; even restaurants).
Masks. Akin to school closings, the beneficial effect of wearing masks was evident during the early
period when states were closing down (Figure 3), and also later during post-opening surges. Under

both conditions, those states that mandated masks23 saw about a twofold reduction in the rate of
new cases. Although political controversy reduced the proportion of the population that wears
masks, those states that combined masks with bar closures saw their post-opening surge rates drop
to declining ones (Figure 4). We surmise that better adherence to the mask mandates would likely
have generated even larger decreases in infection rates.
One exception to the effect of early mask mandates was evident in the data from New York
(Supplemental figure 2), which mandated masks after it had already turned its rapidly rising
infection numbers into declining ones. The mask mandate had no further suppressive effect on
infections. However, when New York later opened its economy, and infections began to rise, that
increase was remarkably lower than those of states that opened without mask mandates in place
(figure 3), suggesting that the early mask mandate had a long lasting effect.
Several studies suggested that early interventions have more effect than later ones. However, our
data show that late interventions can be just as effective as early ones. Compare, for example, the
twofold reductions in infection rates that follow early mask mandates in Figure 3, with the similar
reductions seen in figure 4 - with mandates made months later. Although the numbers of cases at
the time of a late intervention may be larger, setting a higher baseline, the proportional rate
reductions are about the same. Whether flattening a curve at 10 or1000 new cases per day, these
interventions have a major effect that can lead, with time, to lowering infections to the same level.
Finally, Figures 1-4 show that rates of new daily hospitalizations and new deaths seem to parallel
those of new cases, with lag times of about three days to a week for hospitalizations, and a further
lag of 3 - 10 days for deaths. Although improvements in medical care may start to change this
picture24-26, it currently appears that a fairly constant proportion of infected people will become ill
and die. To counter this, we need a global set of effective policies to reduce new infections, as
reductions in hospitalizations and deaths will follow. In the absence of a uniform US federal policy,
we have been able to use the different state policies to determine the value of different
interventions. Our analysis shows that, when combined, the three most powerful interventions closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks - successfully flattened initial infection rates, and
turned post-opening surges into declining ones, suggesting that the country could perhaps open up
its economy safely if it kept bars and schools closed, and required the strict wearing of masks in
public
Coda: If, in a future pandemic with a new infectious agent, governing bodies decide to base
decisions on analyses of rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, we will need to eliminate
the weekend effect, which results in underreporting on weekends and Mondays, and over-reporting
later in the week, in every state examined. This can delay the determination of a rate change for a
week or more, because many data points must accumulate to reliably assign a breakpoint and new
slope. As there is already a biological delay from infection to the onset of symptoms, and a further
delay before testing, any additional delay prevents the timely implementation of needed
interventions. In a rapidly evolving pandemic, reliable data are crucial to the outcome, and every
day counts.

Materials and Methods
Data acquisition: Data for different US states were taken from those published online by the
individual State Health Departments, from “the Covid Tracking Project”27 at the Atlantic under a
Creative Commons CC BY-NC-4.0 license, from Statista28 and from the IHME29. For school
closings, mobility data, and other government actions, we also relied on GitHub30 and then
verified the dates with the various governors’ orders. If the date of official school closing was a
Monday, we used the Saturday before as the first date that students were not in school. For
Mississippi, we found that Colleges and Universities, and most K-12 districts had gone on spring
break about a week and a half before the official Governor’s order to close the schools. We
contacted the Mississippi department of Education, and most of the individual school districts, to
find which, if any, had gone back to school in the interim between spring break and the official
closing order, covering 97.2% of students in the state, and discovered that >87% of those
students had not gone back to school, mostly because of local decisions by their mayors, school
boards or boards of health. We consequently used the first day of spring break as the date of
school closing in Mississippi.
For deaths, we report the combined “confirmed plus probable” when available.

Data were analyzed in two ways. First by visualization on a plot using a Log2 Y axis to find the
approximate dates of breakpoints in the lines. Second, using segmented linear regression to find
and estimate the breakpoints, and to compute regression slopes and confidence intervals. To this
end, trends in the number of new cases, total cases and total deaths were estimated by segmented
regression using the “segmented” package library in R following its authors instructions31. The
independent variable (X) was always “number of days” starting from March 3rd as Day 1. March
3rd was chosen because none of the states examined had any COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations
or deaths reported prior to March 3rd. Initial values for either 2 or 3 segment breakpoints were
provided using the 33rd, 50th, and 66th percentiles of date numbers spanning the range of the total
deaths reported from that particular state. Total deaths were chosen because they typically had
the smallest range of dates, so initial values chosen from the range of total deaths would usually
work for the positive cases and the hospitalizations. If only 2 breakpoints were needed, then only
33rd and 66th percentiles were used. In rare cases where these initial values would not work to fit
a particular variable (e.g. hospitalization or new cases), initial values would be chosen manually
based on the date range of that variable. Estimated breakpoints were generally robust to the
initial values chosen, and would typically yield the same estimated breakpoints even when
substantially different initial values were provided. Estimated breakpoints were reported in
number of days with their standard errors and their predicted date. Slopes for the resulting 3 or 4
regression segments were also reported with their adjusted 95% confidence intervals and their
doubling times, calculated as 1/slope. The 95% confidence intervals can be compared against
zero, to determine if slopes are increasing or decreasing, and they can be compared against each
other to determine if one slope has significantly flattened or significantly increased relative to the
previous slope.
