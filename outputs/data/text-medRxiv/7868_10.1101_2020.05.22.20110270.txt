Abstract
Since the discovery of the novel coronavirus (SARS-Co-V-2) in December 2019, multiple characteristics
have been reported, as our understanding of this new disease unfolds. One such association is its
tendency to cause thromboembolic events, particularly venous thromboembolism1,2. In a four-week period
during the initial spread of COVID-19 at a 300 bed community hospital in western Massachusetts, 23
patients who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA required treatment in either the intensive care unit
(ICU) or intermediate/step-down unit (SDU). All patients were treated with standard DVT prophylaxis from
the time of admission, except for two patients who were on full anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation.
Of the 23 patients, 7 (30%) were diagnosed with acute, clinically significant, pulmonary embolism (PE).
Four of the 7 manifested evidence of acute cor pulmonale, one of whom succumbed as a direct
consequence of a massive PE. Other markers were reviewed in the 7 patients to identify trends that could
allow for early suspicion of PE in COVID-19 patients. Although D-dimer tended to rise during the
hospitalization relative to the control group, the results were inconsistent, and there were no other
meaningful distinguishing features between the groups at the time of admission.
Methods
Starting in mid-March, we reviewed the number of patients who were critically ill from confirmed COVID19 and required ICU or SDU level of care over a four-week period at Berkshire Medical Center in
Pittsfield, MA. We compared the clinical features and laboratory test results of patients with and without
PE. We were limited to descriptive analysis between the two groups given the small sample size. The
study was approved by the institution’s IRB. Informed consent was waived based on criteria outlined in 45
CFR 46.104(d)(4).
Results
Of the 23 COVID-19 positive, critically ill, patients hospitalized during a four-week period at our institution,
7 (30%) were diagnosed with concomitant acute PE during their inpatient stay. The two groups (PE+,
n=7; PE-, n=16), had similar features on admission (Table 1). All patients in both groups were either
former or never smokers. Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common complaints,
but the mean resting heart rate was noted to be modestly higher in the PE group (104 vs. 88). Both
groups showed lymphopenia. Pro-BNP was higher in the PE group at the time of admission, but the
comparison was limited by incomplete data for the two groups. D-dimer trended upward in the PE group
compared to the control group during the hospitalization (Figure 1). Other risk factors for PE, including
BMI, recent surgeries, and travel history were similar across both groups.
Twenty one of the 23 patients were treated with DVT prophylaxis using either subcutaneous
unfractionated heparin (5000 units BID, n=11) or low molecular weight heparin (40 mg daily, n=10)
starting at the time of admission, while two patients were maintained on their home regimen of novel oral
anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (both in the PE- group). Of the seven patients who developed acute
PE, the mean time to diagnosis was 9.4 days following hospitalization. The mean Wells score for the PE+
group was 5.7 and the PE- group 4.2, indicating a lack of discrimination with use of Wells criteria in these
two groups. The diagnosis of acute PE was confirmed by CT pulmonary angiography in 6 patients and by
transthoracic echocardiography in one patient, who suddenly became hypotensive on day five with
severe right ventricular dysfunction and a positive McConnell sign. Despite treatment with thrombolytic
therapy (100 mg intravenous tissue plasminogen activator) he expired three days later with multi-organ
failure secondary to obstructive shock.
Of the 6 surviving PE patients, four were stratified as having minor (low risk) and two as having
submassive (intermediate risk) pulmonary emboli. The mean pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI)
score among our 7 PE patients was 119, indicative of high risk of mortality and morbidity (class IV, 4 to
11.4% 30-day mortality risk). Five received anticoagulation with either therapeutic doses of Heparin or
Enoxaparin and were later converted to oral anticoagulation. One patient was found to have small,

subsegmental PE on CTA, thought to be very low risk, and was maintained on prophylactic doses of
subcutaneous Heparin (increased to 5000 units TID).
Discussion
Our study adds to the growing recognition that patients with COVID-19 appear to be at high risk of
developing PE. Since a search for PE was not conducted in all our patients admitted to the ICU, the 30%
incidence of PE identified in this study may be an underestimate. The mechanism of hypercoagulability in
these patients is not known, but the emergence of antiphospholipid antibodies and/or triggering of
disseminated intravascular coagulation in critically ill patients have been suggested as possible
mechanisms3,4. The latter is also supported by autopsy reports, which have shown the presence of frank
5
hemorrhage along with small thrombi in sections of the lung parenchyma .
In light of the growing incidence of acute PE in COVID-19 patients, despite standard DVT prophylaxis,
intensified regimens of thromboprophylaxis may be indicated. D-dimer tended to rise during
hospitalization in the PE group, which is consistent with studies correlating high D-dimer levels in patients
at high-risk for PE6. However, the results were not consistent, so we could not conclude that initial or
serial D-dimer assays could reliably predict who would subsequently develop PE and who would not.
The incidence of symptomatic PE in a general medical ICU is around 0.7-6%7, well below the 30%
incidence reported in this series. Larger studies are needed to identify risk factors for PE and determine
the level of anticoagulation required for specific subgroups. Meanwhile, clinicians should have a low
threshold to suspect venous thromboembolism while treating patients with COVID-19 and consider
routinely screening these patients and/or utilizing higher doses of thrombo-prophylactic regimens than the
current standard for critically ill patients.

Figure 1 legend
Of the 7 PE+ patients, one had no D-dimer measurements and one had a single D-dimer measurement
(patient 6); of the 16 PE- patients, two had no D-dimer measurements and two had a single D-dimer
measurement (patients 13 and 14). Solid linear regression lines represent PE+ patients (N=5) and dotted
linear regression lines represent PE- patients (N=12). Decreasing linear regression lines only occurred in
PE- patients (2 of 12 = 17%). Increasing linear regression lines occurred in 80% (4 of 5) of the PE+
patients and 33% (4 of 12) of the PE- patients. The remaining linear regression lines were essentially flat,
occurring in 20% (1 of 5) of the PE+ patients and 50% (6 of 12) of the PE- patients.
