Abstract

40

Face masks are one of the currently available options for preventing the transmission of the

41

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the 2019

42

pandemic. However, with the increasing demand for protection, face masks are becoming

43

limited in stock, and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries

44

are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks. Although various

45

technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment, most of them are not

46

applicable for eliminating virus from face masks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a

47

fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks. In this study, using a human

48

coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on face masks, we

49

show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed for a

50

short period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma

51

generator. Scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) tests

52

revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks

53

even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone (five 1-minute exposures).

54

Interestingly, for face masks exposed to ozone gas for 5 min, the amplification of HCoV-229E

55

RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under

56

the effect of ozone, primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope

57

proteins. Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-

58

reach surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks. These results suggest that it may

59

be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well-

60

ventilated place.

Introduction

72

Face masks are serving as one of the options for preventing severe acute respiratory

73

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the 2019 international pandemic of

74

the coronavirus disease. However, with increasing demands for protection, face masks are

75

becoming limited in stock; concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many

76

countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks in many

77

countries. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting

78

contaminated face masks. There already exist technologies for the sterilization of medical

79

equipment, including personal protective equipment (PPE); these technologies include

80

autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging and

81

hydrogen peroxide vaporization. However, most of them are not practical for disinfecting

82

face masks with SARS-CoV-2. It was reported that ozone gas produced by plasma generators

83

can inactivate various types of viruses on different surfaces, including porous ones.

84

is a powerful oxidizing agent, but it does not linger. Its production, involving the use of

85

electricity and a normal atmosphere, is easy and inexpensive. However, it has not been

86

determined whether ozone gas can disinfect face masks contaminated with SARS-CoV-2

87

without compromising the filtration efficiency of the masks.

88

Here we show that a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E)

on face masks lost its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed to gaseous

90

ozone produced by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma generator for a short time (1

91

min) (Figure 1). Neither structural nor functional deterioration of the face masks even with

92

excessive exposures (5 times, 5 min per each time) to the ozone were observed by scanning

93

electron microscopy (SEM) and a particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) test. Interestingly, RNA

94

of HCoV-229E on the face masks by the ozone for 5 min was amplified by reverse

95

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This is the first demonstration of the

96

potential of using ozone gas for disinfecting face masks contaminated with a coronavirus.

viral RNA (Table 2). Similarly, the RNA of either H1N1 (Table S3) or S. aureus (Table S4) on the

face masks was not totally degraded by the exposure to ozone gas. These results suggest

147

that the loss of infectivity could be due to the damage to the viral envelope or envelope

masks.

CONCLUSIONS

190

In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2

191

contamination on face masks, the virus is shown to lose its infectivity to a human cell line

192

(MRC-5) when exposed for a short period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by the DBD

193

plasma generator. SEM and PFE tests revealed that there was no structural or functional

194

deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to

195

ozone (five 1-minute exposures).

196

Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-reach

197

surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks. Inexpensive consumer-grade ozone

198

generators are widely available. Our results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly

199

disinfect face masks contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 using a plasma generator in a well-

200

ventilated place.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DBD plasma generator

204

The plasma generator consists of a high-voltage, high-frequency generator (Minipuls 2.2;

205

GBS Elektronik GmbH, Großerkmannsdorf, Germany) and two electrodes separated by a 1

206

mm -thick alumina dielectric barrier. Each electrode was made of a perforated stainless-steel

207

plate and bare aluminum tape. The plasma was produced only at the perforated electrode,

208

along the rims of the holes. As the dielectric barrier allows electrons and ions to accumulate

209

on the surface, preventing the transition from a cold plasma to an arc, a sinusoidal voltage

210

was applied to steadily produce the plasma (Figure S2). The plasma was turned on for 1 min

UV absorption spectroscopy

213

The ozone concentrations produced by the DBD plasma generator were measured via UV

214

absorption spectroscopy. Light from a mercury lamp (BHK 90-0005-01, spectral line: 253.65

215

nm) was collimated using lenses and an optical fiber and sent through a gas medium, 4.3 cm

216

above the electrode surface where the plasma is produced. The transmitted light intensity

217

was then measured using a spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048L). As the wavelength-dependent

218

absorption cross section of ozone is broad near 253.65 nm and known as

219

cm molecule , the ozone concentration can be evaluated by the Beer-Lambert law

Samples (n = 6) were cut (30 mm × 35 mm in size) from face masks and sprayed with about

250 μL of HCoV-229E culture (4.5 log TCID50 per mL) in a biosafety cabinet at a biosafety

232

dried for 15 min at 25 °C and were individually exposed to ozone for both 1 and 5 min using

233

the plasma generator (Figure 1) in a chemical hood.

234

Determination of TCID50 value

235

Immediately after the exposure, the virus particles on the samples were collected by

Immediately after the exposure, the virus particles on the samples were collected by

(GGCAGTCAGGTTCTTCAACAA) with an amplicon size of 83 bp (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea).

249

The thermocycler conditions were as follows: reverse transcriptase at 50 °C for 30 min and

250

an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for

251

15 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and an extension at 72 °C for 30 s. To confirm that the target

252

amplicon was properly formed, a melting curve analysis was conducted. The fluorescence

253

intensity was measured within the range of 60–95 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/s.

254

SEM

255

A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM-EDS, JSM7500F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo,

256

Japan) was used to take images of untreated and treated masks (n=4). To obtain the

257

morphology of the electrostatic melt blown filter layer, which is the middle layer of the face

258

mask, the melt blown filter was cut to obtain a 5 mm x 5 mm sample that was coated with

259

iridium (Ir) for 15 minutes via the ion sputtering method. The FE-SEM-EDS was operated at

260

15 kV, and the working distance (WD) was 8 mm. All the sample images were acquired with

261

magnification factors of 25, 50, and 200.
