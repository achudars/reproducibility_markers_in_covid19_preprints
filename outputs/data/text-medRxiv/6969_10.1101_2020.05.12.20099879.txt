Abstract
Background: Convalescent plasma is the only antibody based therapy currently
available for COVID-19 patients. It has robust historical precedence and sound
biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown
to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19. Methods: Thus, we analyzed key safety
metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in
5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the
intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19
convalescent plasma. Results: The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in
the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36
reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality
(n=4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n=7), transfusion-related
acute lung injury (TRALI; n=11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n=3).
However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent
plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%.
Conclusion: Given the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of criticallyill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive.
These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and
the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the US exceed that of any other country
in the world (1). The overall case fatality rate for diagnosed COVID-19, appears to be
about 4% (2), and reports from Wuhan suggest case-fatality rates of 14% among
hospitalized patients (3), and 57% among intensive care unit (ICU) admissions on
ventilators or requiring a fraction of inspired oxygen > 60% (4). The reported fatality rate
in the United States ranged from 21% in New York City hospitals (5) to 50% reported in
an early case series from the Seattle area (6). In response to the COVID-19 outbreak in
the US and reported case-fatality rates, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and national blood banking community developed a
national Expanded Access Program (EAP) to collect and distribute convalescent plasma
donated by individuals that have recovered from COVID-19. There is historical
precedent to anticipate that human convalescent plasma is a viable option for mitigation
and treatment of COVID-19 (7, 8). Human convalescent plasma uses antibodies
harvested from recently-infected and currently-recovered COVID-19 patients to treat
currently-infected COVID-19 patients. This approach is referred to as passive antibody
therapy. As recently summarized (7), convalescent plasma represents a promising
treatment strategy with strong historical precedence, biological plausibility, and limited
barriers for rapid development and deployment of this investigational therapy.
Passive antibody therapy was first described in the 1890s as the only means of
treating certain infectious diseases prior to the development of antimicrobial therapy in
the 1940s (9). Convalescent plasma was used during the 1918 flu epidemic and

reduced mortality among plasma recipients (10). More recently, two other epidemics
caused by coronaviruses have been associated with high mortality, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The SARS-CoV-1 epidemic was contained, but MERS
became endemic in the Middle East and triggered a secondary major outbreak in South
Korea. In both viral outbreaks, the high mortality and absence of effective therapies led
to the use of convalescent plasma. In the largest study of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak,
among 80 patients in Hong Kong (11), patients treated within the first 14 days of
infection had earlier discharge from hospital. These results are consistent with the
notion that convalescent plasma may be an effective treatment of coronavirus infections
and that earlier administration is more likely to be successful.
Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been demonstrated to be
safe as a treatment for COVID-19. Thus, we analyzed key safety metrics following
transfusion of convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or
life-threatening COVID-19. We hypothesized that the rate of serious adverse events
related to the transfusion of convalescent plasma per se would be low and that the
seven-day mortality rate would not be demonstrably elevated compared to other
experiences with this deadly disease.

Results
EAP Participation. From April 3 to May 11, 2020, a total of 14,288 patients with
severe or life-threatening COVID-19 or who were judged by a healthcare provider to be
at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening COVID-19 were enrolled in the
EAP. In that time, a total of 8,932 enrolled patients received a COVID-19 convalescent
plasma transfusion, Figure 1. Data from the first 5,000 transfused patients were
included in this report.
Demographics. Key demographic characteristics of the patients are presented
in Table 1. The data set included 3,153 men, 1,824 women and 23 persons in other
gender/sex categories with diverse racial representation including Asian (6%), American
Indian or Alaskan Native (<1%), Black (18%), White (49%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific
Islander (<1%) and Multi-racial (<1%). The median age was 62 years (range, 18 – 97
years).
Clinical Status and Symptoms. At the time of enrollment, 4,051 (81%) patients
had severe or life-threatening COVID-19 and 949 (19%) were judged to have a high risk
of progressing to severe or life-threatening COVID-19. Prior to COVID-19 convalescent
plasma transfusion, a total of 3,316 patients (66%) were admitted to the ICU. Of the
4,051 patients diagnosed with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, 72% had respiratory
failure, 63% reported dyspnea, 62% had a blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, 43% had
lung infiltrates >50% within 24-28 hours of enrollment, 38% had a respiratory frequency
≥ 30 breaths·minute-1, 34% had partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired
oxygen ratio < 300, 18% had multiple organ dysfunction or failure, and 15% had septic
shock.

Serious Adverse Events. Within four hours of completion of the COVID-19
convalescent plasma transfusion (inclusive of the plasma transfusion), 36 serious
adverse events (SAEs) were reported (<1% of all transfusions). The attribution scale
used by the treating physicians for evaluating the SAEs included unrelated, possibility
related, probably related, or definitely related. Of the SAEs, 15 deaths were reported
(0.3% of all transfusions) and four of those deaths were judged as related (possibly,
n=3; probably, n=1; definitely, n=0) to the transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent
plasma. There were 21 non-death SAEs reported, with seven reports of transfusionassociated circulatory overload (TACO), eleven reports of transfusion-related acute lung
injury (TRALI), and three reports of severe allergic transfusion reaction. All incidences of
TACO and TRALI were judged as related (possibly, n=9; probably, n=7; definitely, n=2)
to the transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. The SAEs and their attributions
are summarized in Table 2.
Over the first seven days after the convalescent plasma transfusion, a total of
602 mortalities were observed. The overall seven-day mortality rate was estimated to be
14.9% (95% CI: 13.8%, 16.0%) using the product limit estimator; an estimate that was
numerically higher than the crude estimate of 12.0% at day 7. Of the 3,316 patients
admitted to the ICU, 456 mortalities were observed (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.3%, 18.1%). Of
the 1,682 hospitalized patients not-admitted to the ICU, 146 mortalities were observed
(11.2%, 95% CI: 9.5%, 12.9%).

Discussion
Safety Summary. In this initial report of 5,000 hospitalized patients in the US
with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, or who were judged by a healthcare provider
to be at high risk of progressing to severe or life-threatening COVID-19, the overall
frequency of SAEs within four hours following the transfusion of COVID-19
convalescent plasma was less than 1% (n = 36) and the seven-day mortality rate was
14.9%. Although 70% of these SAEs were deemed to be related to plasma transfusion
by treating physicians, most of the SAEs (56%) were judged as possibly related,
suggesting uncertainty about the role of the transfusion per se in the adverse reaction.
Additionally, the rate of SAEs definitely related to transfusion was objectively low (n = 2,
<0.1% of all transfusions).
Although this study was not designed to evaluate efficacy of convalescent
plasma we note with optimism the relatively low mortality in treated patients. The case
fatality rate of COVID-19 has been reported to be ~4% among all persons diagnosed
with COVID-19 (2); however, the case fatality rate among hospitalized patients is much
higher ~15-20% (3, 5) and even more so among patients admitted to the ICU (57%) (4).
Thus, the seven-day mortality rate was 14.9% reported here is not alarming, particularly
because some of these plasma transfusions may be characterized as attempts at
rescue or salvage therapy in patients admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure, sepsis
and significant comorbidities.
Despite these early and encouraging safety signals, there are several risks of
COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion in critically-ill patients that warrant attention
in this initial assessment of safety (12, 13).

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated
circulatory overload (TACO). The highest risk of mortality following plasma transfusion
is likely due to sequelae pulmonary complications (14), and this risk is probably
exacerbated by the underlying respiratory distress associated with COVID-19.
Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory
overload (TACO) are the two leading causes of transfusion-related mortality, and are
often difficult to distinguish. These conditions have been emphasized in the plasma
transfusion literature, but making an unequivocal determination of plasma-related
toxicity in critically ill individuals is difficult in the face of ongoing conditions that
resemble transfusion SAEs. Consequently, it is likely that some of the reported SAEs
represent natural progression of the ongoing pathological processes.
The most common adverse event associated with plasma transfusion in
critically-ill patients is TACO, which results in pulmonary edema and left atrial
hypertension subsequent to circulatory overload. The reported incidence of TACO
includes a large range from 1 in 14,000 in surveillance surveys to 12% in prospective
studies in higher risk populations, showing the dependence of incidence on the clinical
status of the transfusion recipient (15-17). TRALI often presents as bilateral pulmonary
edema with little evidence of circulatory overload, and TRALI is further categorized into
two types based on the absence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) risk
factors (type I) or presence of ARDS risk factors (type II) (18). The reported incidence of
TRALI similarly covers a large range from ~0.01% in surveillance surveys to 8% in
prospective studies of the critically ill (19, 20). The underlying lung injury associated with
COVID-19 further complicates the differential diagnosis of TACO and TRALI, and may

exacerbate the risk of transfusion-related reactions in these critically-ill patients.
Although the incidence of transfusion-related reactions (TACO and TRALI) among
critically-ill patients may be anticipated to be nearly 10%, the current data demonstrate
an overall rate of reported transfusion-related serious adverse events less than 1%.
Thus, the low rates of TRALI and TACO along with the “possibly related” attribution of
most cases are reassuring.
Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). A theoretical concern of the use of
COVID-19 convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19 is a deteriorated clinical
condition after plasma transfusion secondary to antibody-dependent enhancement
(ADE) of infection or antibody-mediated proinflammatory effects (21). This theoretical
concern is supported by reports of ADE in macaques given specific antibody
administration prior to SARS-CoV-1 experimental infection (22) and ADE effects with
other coronaviruses (23, 24). There is also the concern that antibody administration to
individuals with significant viral loads may lead to the formation of antigen-antibody
immune complexes, which may contribute to proinflammatory immune responses (25,
26). Although the specific signs and symptoms of ADE in humans with coronavirus
infection are unknown, such an effect would presumably be associated with clinical
deterioration and/or worse outcomes following convalescent plasma administration. The
absence of a toxicity signature with the use of convalescent plasma in individuals with
COVID-19 implies that this phenomenon may be clinically inconsequential. COVID-19 is
known to elicit high neutralizing antibody titers in individuals who have recently
recovered from infection and three case series of convalescent plasma administration
also describe no deleterious ADE effects after infusion (27-29). The absence of

untoward antibody-related effects after convalescent plasma administration could be
due to the preferential binding of the neutralizing antibody to the virus rather than to
immune cells or tissues which would be needed to enhance the proinflammatory
immune responses responsible for ADE (30). Despite the absence of an apparent toxic
effect attributable to specific antibody administration thus far, we caution continued
vigilance as the use of antibody-based therapies and the number of treated individuals
expands, particularly because specific high-risk groups may emerge that were not
discernable in this initial cohort.
Transfusion reactions and coagulation derangements. Another theoretical
risk for convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 is the possibility that it could exacerbate
the type of coagulation derangements associated with advanced COVID-19 (31).
Absence of clinical outcomes related to severe thrombotic events within the four-hour
SAE reports suggests that administration of 1-2 units of convalescent plasma does not
acutely exacerbate potentially underlying disordered coagulation among critically-ill
COVID-19 patients.
Limitations. A key limitation of our observations includes the lack of detailed
training of study personnel and monitoring in a highly diverse group of sites ranging
from small community hospitals in rural areas to urban public hospitals to full-service
academic medical centers. Given the speed at which the EAP was implemented and
considering the stress on clinical staff at participating sites during this on-going
pandemic, the web-based case reporting forms were designed to optimize convenience.
Additionally, although the patient inclusion criteria were specific to hospitalized patients,
these criteria were exceptionally broad. While these elements of the EAP may be

suboptimal, they are perhaps understandable in a crisis of the magnitude of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The efficacy of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been
determined, and this report, focused on safety signals, should not be misconstrued as
evidence of effectiveness. To test the efficacy of this therapy, future analyses of EAP
data will include exposure control cohorts of patients who did not receive COVID-19
convalescent plasma. However, randomized controlled trials— some of which are
currently in progress— will ultimately be necessary to evaluate the potential efficacy of
convalescent

plasma

treatment

along

the

continuum

of

disease-severity

(http://ccpp19.org). Importantly, evolving data from the EAP will continue to have high
utility in understanding the real world safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
Conclusion. In summary, the experience from the first 5000 patients with
COVID-19 transfused with convalescent plasma provides no signal of toxicity beyond
what is expected from plasma use in severely ill patients. Additionally, given the deadly
nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients with multiple
comorbidities included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive.
We also note that the data were reviewed by an independent Data and Safety
Monitoring Board and have been deposited with the FDA and at no time was there
consideration of stopping this therapy.

Given the accelerating deployment of this

therapy, these emerging data provide early safety indicators of convalescent plasma for
COVID-19 treatment and suggest research should shift focus toward determining the
efficacy of convalescent plasma.

Methods
Design and Oversight. The program is an FDA-initiated, national, multicenter,
open-label Expanded Access Program (EAP) in hospitalized adults with severe or
life-threatening COVID-19, or who were judged by a healthcare provider to be at high
risk of progression to severe or life-threatening COVID-19. Initial discussions between
the FDA and the Mayo Clinic related to the EAP began on March 30th, 2020. The
program was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) on April 1st,
2020 which served as the central IRB for all participating facilities and empaneled an
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board to oversee the safety analysis. All
hospitals or acute care facilities in the US (including territories) were eligible to
participate. Any willing, licensed US physician could participate as a treating physicianPrincipal investigator, provided they agreed to adhere to the treatment protocol, the
terms of the FDA 1572 form, and all appropriate federal and state regulations.
Registration occurred through the EAP central website, www.uscovidplasma.org.
The administrative and compliance infrastructure to implement the EAP was
rapidly developed, and the initial web-based registration, compliance and data-entry
system went live on April 3rd, 2020. The first patient received convalescent plasma on
April 7th, and more than 5,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were transfused with
convalescent plasma under the EAP by May 3rd. Figure 1 illustrates that over 2,000
acute care facilities have been registered and over 10,000 patients have been enrolled
in the EAP across all 50 states and multiple US territories. Written informed consent
was obtained from the participant or a legally-authorized representative prior to

enrollment, except in jurisdictions allowing deferral of consent for emergency treatment,
in which case, consent was obtained to continue participation.
Participants. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, hospitalized with a
laboratory confirmed diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and had, or were judged by a healthcare provider to be at
high risk of progression to, severe or life-threatening COVID-19. Severe or lifethreatening COVID-19 is defined by one or more of the following criterion: dyspnea,
respiratory frequency ≥ 30 breaths·minute-1, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, lung
infiltrates >50% within 24-28 hours of enrollment, respiratory failure, septic shock, and
multiple organ dysfunction or failure.
Procedures. ABO-compatible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (200 – 500 mL)
was administered intravenously according to institutional transfusion guidelines.
Patients were continuously monitored with clinical assessments. Web-based standard
data reporting surveys were completed 4-hours and 7-days post-transfusion, with
additional forms used to report serious adverse events using the Research Electronic
Data Capture (REDCap) system. All serious adverse event reports will be independently
adjudicated over the course of the study by the IND Sponsor and trained designee
(AMK) using the National Healthcare Safety Network Biovigilance Component
Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol as a framework (12).
Outcomes. The primary outcome was to determine the safety of transfusion of
COVID-19 convalescent plasma assessed as the incidence and relatedness of serious
adverse events including death.

Statistics. To facilitate the rapid enrollment of participants, sites and
investigators, an electronic data collection system hosted at Mayo Clinic was built using
the Research Electronic Data Capture System (REDCap, v.9.1.15 Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN) (32, 33). Raw data were retrieved from REDCap via the application
programming interface (API) and subjected to data consistency checks. Data presented
in this initial safety report may undergo additional data quality control measures as the
study progresses. The proportion of people that experienced one of a series of
previously defined serious adverse events (SAEs) was summarized using a point
estimate and 95% score confidence interval. To assess mortality, the time (in days)
between transfusion and death was examined using the Kaplan Meier product limit
estimator. Participants were censored at their last known vital status and all reported
deaths through seven days were used to estimate the survival function. Data were
censored at 0.25 days for patients that did not have follow-up beyond the initial report at
four hours post transfusion at time of the analysis. For patients that expired within 24
hours, a survival time of 0.5 days was assigned. Precise time of day for key events was
not recorded in the data collection system; thus, these imprecise time estimates were
used. The point estimate and 95% CI were estimated at day 7 based on the estimated
survival function. All analyses and graphics were produced with R version 3.6.2
(Vienna, Austria).

Figure 1. Participation in the US COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Expanded
Access Program (EAP) including data extracted on May 11, 2020. A. Choropleth
map displaying the number of cumulatively enrolled patients in the EAP within each
state of the contiguous US, with lower enrollment values displayed in a lighter hue and
higher enrollment values displayed in a darker hue of blue. Registered acute care
facilities are represented as filled yellow circles, with larger circles indicating greater
number of registered facilities within the metropolitan area of a city. The choropleth map
does not display data from non-contiguous US locations, including registered facilities in
Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands. B. The
chronological line charts represent the cumulative number of enrolled patients (blue
line) and the cumulative number of patients that have received a COVID-19
convalescent plasma transfusion (yellow line). The chronological bar charts represent
analogous values— the number of enrolled patients (blue bars) and number of patients
that have received a COVID 19 convalescent plasma transfusion (yellow bars) by day.
The difference between the blue and yellow bars highlights a fulfillment gap in
COVID-19 convalescent plasma, which was most acute at the onset of the EAP and has
substantially improved.

This category of serious adverse events (SAE) reports the aggregate total of possibly-, probably- and definitely-related SAEs, as
attributed based on the site investigator's determination. The estimate is based on the number of related SAEs relative to the
denominator of 5,000.
b
The estimated seven-day mortality rate is based on a Kaplan-Meier estimate using all reported deaths. See methods for further
estimation details including handling of censoring due to ongoing data collection.
