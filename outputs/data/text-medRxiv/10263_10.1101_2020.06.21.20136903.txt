whether the data supported its continuation and whether there might be important lessons

therein for a wider medical audience.

METHODOLOGY OF LOCAL PROTOCOL AND AUDIT

Our local protocol (see Table 1) was implemented in mid-April 2020, along with the intention

to audit the data as it accumulated (NuTH NHS Foundation Trust Clinical Governance & Audit

Registration No. 10075, with permission from the Information Guardian to share results

externally).

Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured in 134 affected patients admitted to

NuTH NHS Foundation Trust.

In our institution, SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were defined

by a positive swab [using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)], or – if

swab-negative – by the presence of characteristic clinical, radiological and haematological

findings of COVID-19 infection.

Measurement of serum 25(OH)D was performed using the

Roche Elecsys vitamin D total II immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

In cases of undetectable levels of serum 25(OH)D, the lower limit of sensitivity of our assay

i.e. 8 nmol/L) divided by square root of 2 was used for analyses.

(

A cut-off of greater than 50

nmol/L was defined as normal range as per previously published guidelines [16].

Patients found to have VDD were treated wherever possible according to the protocol given

in Table 1, wherein the replacement dosage was determined by severity of deficiency (Table

1), based on pharmacokinetic data from Romagnoli,

et al. [17].

Patients who did not receive

treatment included some who had already been discharged home, were deceased, or were

receiving “end-of-life care” by the time 25(OH)D results were available (n=50/113; 44.2%).

No adverse effects, such as hypercalcemia, were reported after treatment.

Results

Descriptive characteristics of our audit population are summarized in Table 2.

It was striking

that, overall, 90/134 (66.4%) of Covid-19 inpatients had vitamin D insufficiency (<50 nmol/L);

50/134 (37.3%) inpatients had deficiency (<25 nmol/L) and 29/134 inpatients (21.6%) had

very severe deficiency (≤15 nmol/L).

Patients admitted to ITU were significantly younger (ITU: 61.1 years ± 11.8

vs. non-ITU: 76.4

years ± 14.9, p<0.001) and more frequently hypertensive, and had higher respiratory rate

Due to the ongoing pandemic, data on vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients so far has been

patchy.

To the best of our knowledge, no such studies have been published regarding UK or

European inpatient cohorts with COVID-19.

A recent publication highlighted a potential

crude association between 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 mortality, in that countries with

increased mortality from COVID-19 also exhibit a high prevalence of VDD within the general

population [25].

Another study from Indonesia recruiting 780 individuals, showed that low

pre-admission 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with fatality from COVID-19 [26].

We did not find any significant association between vitamin D status and inpatient mortality,

but this was not unexpected given that we had proactively treated all COVID-19 patients

with VDD wherever possible.

However, longer-term follow-up of these patients (which is

ongoing), may yet reveal future differences in 28- or 90-day mortality.

Other groups have looked specifically at possible associations between vitamin D status and

In a small US study recruiting 20 patients, vitamin D insufficiency was evident in 11 out of 13

(84.6%) ITU patients compared to 57.1% of patients treated in standard medical wards [30].

The authors failed to reach statistical significance, but overall, these results concord with our

observations. More importantly, the authors reported that all ITU patients aged less than 75

years had substantially low vitamin D levels.

In our inpatient COVID-19 population, we

found that only 19% of our ITU patients were vitamin D replete, which is startling, as this

group was significantly younger and had fewer of the co-morbidities traditionally associated

with VDD.

This finding challenges previous beliefs that VDD is a problem limited to the

elderly frail population, and has significant implications for influencing public health advice,

Our findings also suggest that, outwith the established risk factors thus far associated with

COVID-19 mortality (age, gender and relevant co-morbidities); VDD may be an important

and hitherto under-recognized determinant of illness severity.

Strengths of the present data include its novelty and assessment of serum 25(OH)D levels

suggesting that 25OHD may be a negative acute phase reactant due to dysregulated vitamin

Nevertheless, these data provide an important

impetus to the commissioning, design and interpretation of ongoing or future multi-center

randomized controlled trials, which could conclusively define a therapeutic role of vitamin D

in COVID-19.

In addition, our population consisted of predominantly Caucasian patients with moderate to

severe symptoms from COVID-19 and, given that the vast majority of COVID-19 cases are

asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (not requiring hospital admission), community-based

studies are needed to address whether adequate vitamin D concentrations reduce the risk

for hospital attendance.

We have proactively treated VDD in our patients per our Trust

protocol described herein and this might partly explain the lack of association of baseline

serum 25(OH)D with fatality.

Also, since data collection was performed in a retrospective

manner, patients included in this audit may have been actively treated with various other

medications as part of clinical research trials to identify successful treatment for COVID-19

and it is therefore almost impossible to adjust for this in the analysis.

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report exploring serum 25(OH)D

levels in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19 in Europe.

Vitamin D status was not associated with inpatient fatality

in our cohort, possibly due to the limited sample size and our protocol for rapid diagnosis

and treatment of VDD.

Larger studies are urgently needed to further establish the role of

vitamin D status in COVID-19 and, more importantly, explore the use of vitamin D as a

potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate against this major new infection.
