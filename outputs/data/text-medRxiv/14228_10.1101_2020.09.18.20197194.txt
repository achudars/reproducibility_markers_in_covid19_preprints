Abstract
Relevance: Laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infection combined with tracing/quarantine for contacts of infected individuals
affects the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and levels of related mortality. At
the same time, testing practices for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary in the different
regions of the Russian Federation. For example, in the city of St. Petersburg,
where mortality rate for COVID-19 is the highest in the Russian Federation on
Oct. 25, 2020, every death for COVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of
COVID-19 in the population, while the corresponding number for the whole of
Russia is 58.1, suggesting limited detection of mild and moderate cases of
COVID-19 in St. Petersburg. Additionally, while in some regions in Russia, all
individuals with respiratory symptoms presenting for medical care are tested for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a number of other regions in Russia, only certain
categories of individuals presenting for medical care with respiratory symptoms
were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to Oct. 26, 2020.
Materials & Methods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the population
results in increased detectability (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases
among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) and decreased

case-fatality ratio (CFR, the proportion of deaths among reported COVID-19
cases in the population) – this because under more active testing, the number of
mild and moderate cases of COVID-19 increases. We used data from the
Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and
Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) on the number of detected cases and the
number of deaths from COVID-19 in the different regions of the Russian
Federation to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation.
Results: The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for
COVID-19 in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020
is 0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability of
SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for COVID-19 are
relatively high.
Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the factors that
affects the levels of mortality from COVID-19 – higher detectability contributes to
lower rates of mortality for COVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test
all individuals with respiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2
infection (which is also suggested by the recent recommendations from the
Ministry of Health), and to undertake additional measures to increase the volume
of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Such measures, in combination with quarantine for
infected cases and their close contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARSCoV-2 infection and diminish the related mortality.

Introduction
Laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection combined
with tracing/quarantine for contacts of infected individuals is an effective means
for diminishing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and decreasing the

levels of associated mortality. For example, the corresponding diagnostics and
quarantine is widely practiced in Iceland -- using serological data and data on
PCR-detected SARS-CoV-2 infections, Gudbjartsson et al. estimated that 56% of
all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iceland were PCR-detected [1]. During the
Spring wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in New South Wales, Australia, a
small number of infections were recorded in schools [2], with widespread testing
in schools and subsequent quarantine for contacts of detected cases practiced.
Widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection is also conducted in the Russian
Federation [3]; however, testing practices for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary in the
different regions of the Russian Federation. For example, while in some regions
in Russia, all individuals with respiratory symptoms presenting for medical care
are tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection [4,5], in a number of other regions in
Russia, only certain categories of individuals presenting for medical care with
respiratory symptoms (e.g. persons aged over 65y, healthcare workers, etc.)
were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to Oct. 26, 2020 [6,7]. There is
limited information on the effect of differences in testing practices on the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rates of related mortality.
The effect of testing practices on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends
on the detectability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. the proportion of detected
COVID-19 cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population).
Higher detectability in combination with quarantine for infected individuals and
their (symptomatic) contacts results in the prevention of a greater number of new
cases of infection, bringing down the rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection
in the population. Under more active testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the population,
detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases, and the case-fatality ratio (i.e.
the proportion of deaths among reported COVID-19 cases in the population)
decreases – this because under more active testing, the number of detected mild
and moderate cases of COVID-19 increases, with the ratio between the number

of deaths and the number of cases declining. Therefore, a lower case-fatality
ratio generally corresponds to higher detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
different regions in Russia. Here, we used data from the Russian Federal Service
for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing
(Rospotrebnadzor) on the number of detected cases of COVID-19 and the
number of deaths from COVID-19 in the different regions of the Russian
Federation [8] to examine the relation between case-fatality ratios and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation
(Federal subject of Russia).

Methods
Data: We used data from Rospotrebnadrzor on the number of detected COVID19 cases and the number of deaths from COVID-19 reported by Oct. 25, 2020 in
the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation [8], as well as data from the
Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) on the population on January
1, 2020 for the 85 regions of the Russian Federation [9].
Informed consent: We used publicly available, aggregate data, with no informed
consent from the participants sought.
Statistical analysis: We evaluated the linear correlation between case-fatality
ratios for COVID-19 for cases/deaths reported by Oct. 25, 2020 and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 persons for deaths reported by Oct. 25, 2020
in the 85 different regions of the Russian Federation.

Figure 1 shows the case-fatality ratios (i.e. the proportion of deaths among
reported COVID-19 cases in the population by Oct. 25, 2020) and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 per 100,000 persons for deaths reported by Oct. 25, 2020
in the 85 regions of the Russian Federation. The correlation between casefatality ratios and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in the different regions of the
Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is 0.64 (0.50,0.75). The region with both the
highest COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 persons and the highest casefatality ratio – 6.4% (lowest detectability of SARS-COV-2 infection) is the city of
St. Petersburg (top right of Figure 1). For each COVID-19 death in St. Petersburg
reported by Oct. 25, 2020, there are 15.7 detected COVID-19 cases, compared
to a national average of 58.1 cases, suggesting limited detectability of SARSCoV-2 infection in St. Petersburg.

Active testing for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection combined with
tracing/quarantine for close contacts of infected individuals affects the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 [10] and the levels of related mortality. High levels of testing for the
novel coronavirus infection were reported in several countries [1,11], including
the Russian Federation. Such robust testing for SARS-CoV-2 leads to high
detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. the percent of detected COVID-19
cases among all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population) – for example,
in Iceland, detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated at 56% [1].
Testing practices for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary in the different regions of the
Russian Federation. For example, while in some regions in Russia, all individuals
with respiratory symptoms presenting for medical care are tested for SARS-CoV2 infection [4,5], in a number of other regions in Russia, only certain categories of
individuals presenting for medical care with respiratory symptoms (e.g. persons
aged over 65y, healthcare workers, etc.) were tested for the SARS-CoV-2
infection prior to Oct. 26, 2020 [6,7]. New guidelines, including the
recommendation for testing of all symptomatic individuals for SARS-CoV-2
infection were issued by the Russian Ministry of Health on Oct. 26, 2020 [3], and
the effect of those guidelines on testing practices in still uncertain. Moreover,
there is limited information on the effect of (prior) differences in testing practices
and detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the
rates of mortality for COVID-19 for the different regions of the Russian
Federation.
Here, using data from Rospotrebnadrzor on the number of detected COVID-19
cases and the number of deaths for COVID-19 [8] we established a high
correlation between case-fatality ratios (the proportion of deaths among reported
COVID-19 cases in the population) and rates of mortality for COVID-19 in
different regions of the Russian Federation. We should note that a lower casefatality ratio corresponds to a higher detectability of SARS-COV-2 infection.

Correspondingly, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and detectability of SARSCoV-2 infection are some of the factors that affect the levels of mortality for
COVID-19 in Russia. In particular, higher detectability of SARS-CoV-2 infection is
generally associated with lower mortality for COVID-19 (Figure 1). To increase
detectability, one ought to test all individuals with respiratory symptoms seeking
medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection (which is also suggested by the recent
recommendations from the Ministry of Health [3]), and to undertake additional
measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2. Such measures, in
combination with quarantine for infected cases and their close contacts help to
mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and diminish the related
mortality.
