Abstract.
A study with a societal objective was carried out on people exchanging on social networks and more particularly on
Twitter to observe their feelings on the COVID-19. A dataset of more than 600,000 tweets with hashtags like
#COVID and #coronavirus posted between February 27, 2020 and March 25, 2020 was built. An exploratory
treatment of the number of tweets posted by country, by language and other parameters revealed an overview of the
apprehension of the pandemic around the world. A sentiment analysis was elaborated on the basis of the tweets
posted in English because these constitute the great majority (USA, GB, India…). On the other hand, the FP-Growth
algorithm was adapted to the tweets in order to discover the most frequent patterns and its derived association rules,
in order to highlight the tweeters insights relatively to COVID-19.
Keywords: tweets Analytics, COVID-19, sentiment analysis, frequent patterns, association rules mining

1 Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread
worldwide in more than 198 countries. Within a couple of months, this outbreak has upset the world and
uncertainties about the future were for the first time evoked. Several epidemic periods have been observed in
the world. In the recent years, this epidemics phenomenon has grown because of the contagion favored by the
globalization. Nowadays, epidemics provoke extreme economic crisis at the scale of countries as well at the
individual level. People can reach psychosis symptoms because of the contagion and countries may suffer
from economic crisis due to people traveling restriction and social isolation. In [8], the authors give several
battle hints to fight the virus as it travels the world, the metaphor of war is used.
Doctors and people the most affected psychologically by the epidemics are the most likely to talk about it on
social networks like Twitter, which have become essential in our daily lives. The analysis of internet users’
behavior has shown that they are mostly either seekers of information from the Web or social media
(Facebook, Twitter, microblogs…) [3], [4], [15]. Understanding better this data flow can be of great benefit
to people and the industry to make informed and focused decisions on how to meet goals. Many companies
have monitoring activities on social media sites to collect information. For example, talking on social sites
about a city or an airport in a positive way improves its image.
One of the most popular social networks on the web is Twitter. Tweets are based on the format of micro-blogs
and constitute an important source of archive data, allowing its export for academic research purposes.
As part of this work, we performed a datamining study on COVID-19 by analyzing Twitter publications in
relation to this disease, posted between 23 February 2020 and 03 March 2020. The outcomes could help
dressing an inventory for the history of the outbreak and especially how it was apprehended by the world
population. Technically, we first collected tweets in relation to the coronavirus using NodeXL and stored the
recovered tweets in a dataset. In a second step, the data underwent a preprocessing with a statistical analysis
in order to extract knowledge helping their understanding. Thereafter we conducted a sentiment analysis on
the dataset to come up with the feelings of the twitters during the period of study. In addition to this effort, the
most frequent patterns were extracted with the aim to grasp social features about the twitters. Among the
datamining algorithms that can handle such issue, FP-Growth was selected because of its effectiveness and
efficiency.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present related and recent works on tweets analyses
and the coronavirus.
Section 3 details the approach of building the tweets dataset. Section 4 describes the the

sentiment analysis algorithm we designed as well as its empirical results. Section 5 presents the adaptation of
FP-Growth algorithm to tweets and the experimental results prior to conclude the main contributions.

2. Related Work
COVID-19 appeared recently in December 2019 in Wuhan China and yet hundreds of publications on this
topic updated daily can be found in [16]. Studies from around the world are performed within a very short
period of time as the COVID-19 took its toll in almost all countries [14]. This fact translates the importance
of studying this virus in order to speed up the mastery of the disease and the discovery of a remedy. With an
impressive number, popular articles on COVID-19 are widely published on daily classic media relating the
disease spread, the worrying issues and also helping to cope with the cultural customs and to urge for people
isolation to limit the disease propagation. This invisible virus is considered as the most dangerous enemy for
the humanity and the metaphor of war against it, was adopted by certain scientists who advice some military
strategies to combat this disease [8].
Tweets analysis has known an increasing number of efforts these last years. Most of them are interested in
determining features of social interactions of tweeters [2] [4] and tweeters behaviors [3] [15]. Also tweets
analytics tools have been developed to be applied on numerous subjects [17].
There is a recent and rich literature on sentiment analysis (SA) and its applications to various fields. SA has
been also investigated for social networking data and is generally used by companies for analyzing the opinion
and feelings of the customers about products, services and company strategies [5] [9] [10] [11] [12].
Sophisticated datamining tools such as classification, clustering and association rules mining were developed
[7] [13] and used in a very large spectrum of domains. Association rules mining that are investigated on our
tweets data have also known impressive development for use on huge volume and complex data [1] [6].
For the present work, as COVID-19 is the subject of the hour for the whole planet, we conducted a tweets
analytics study on this phenomenon focusing on generating social features of tweeters hoping to achieve
important insights.

3.Tweets Collect and building a dataset
As a starting step to handle the study on COVID-19 tweets mining, we carried out the construction of a dataset.
We provide metadata for the dataset, which merely describes its characteristics such as its title and description,
keywords or tags, publisher, date of publication or terms of use. In this section, we present the different steps
performed to achieve a dataset of tweets on COVID-19 of a high quality.

3.1. Extraction of raw data
NodeXL was exploited to extract tweets related to the Coronavirus topic and highlighted by the following
hashtags: #COVID-19, #COVID19, #COVID, #Coronavirus and #Corona. The crawling data period started
on the 27th of February and ended on the 25th of March, which is spread over four weeks. During this phase,
the world has known tremendous changes, especially in its whole organization. The huge number of infected
and dead people provoked public panic and fear, which raised supply shortages not only in pharmaceuticals
and PPE but also in food. Several countries have known a bad public health management and a rapid scalability
in world economic crisis has been observed during a very short lapse of time. Rushes on public market have

been seen before certain governments decreed isolation and quarantine for inhabitants an especially for
returning travelers. All these upheavals impact on the humanity behaviors.
The aim of this study is to shed light on all these aspects through mining tasks on the extracted collection. The
latter contains more than a half million tweets written in several languages and sent from many countries.

3.2 Tweets Preprocessing
Programming codes in Java language were developed for basic cleaning steps on the collected tweets. Textual
data analysis was first held to eliminate hyperlinks, mentions and punctuations. Stop words such as the articles,
the prepositions of conjunction, time and place and the superfluous and unnecessary words, were removed as
they do not have impact on the text meaning. The keywords are then determined by the Stemming Algorithm,
which consists in associating to each remaining word its root. Let remark that some words were misspelled,
an example is the word ‘carona’ which was used by President Trump and repeated by others users 8013 times.
This kind of typos was simply eliminated.

3.3 Descriptive Dataset and Metadata
The created dataset includes at the row level the different tweets and at the column level the different attributes,
which are described as follows.
1. Author
2. Recipient
3. Tweet
4. Hashtags
5. Language
6. Relationship
7. Location
8. Date
9. Source
The Attributes are all of string type except for the date which follows the ‘month/day/year’ format. The dataset
contains 653 996 tweets with no missing values. Table 1 gives an overview of a portion of the dataset with 9
attributes, the contents of the tweets are truncated for lack of space to insert the figure. Note that the location
is not always provided.

4. Tweets Analytical Insight for COVID-19
As a second contribution, we performed an analytical study on the constructed dataset in order to mine
knowledge allowing an understanding and a mastery of the tweeters insights before performing datamining
tasks, which help to provide a more comprehensive perception. This analysis provides data trends and
distributions, descriptive statistics, data groupings and helps formulating hypotheses. This important and
costly step is common to several data mining tasks. Among the latter, we focus on association rule generation
based on frequent patterns mining using an adapted FP-Growth algorithm [7].
The experiments of the developed program in Java for analytics was executed on the 653 996 tweets and the
different outcomes are exhibited in the following subsections.

4.1. Top Hashtags
The hashtags #COVID-19, #COVID19, #COVID, #Coronavirus and #Corona that served for the construction
of the dataset are not considered since each tweet contains at least one of them. Figure 1 shows the top 20
hashtags, which report some events and situations such as pandemic, update, outbreak, stayAtHome, curfew,
ConfinementTotal (French words) and quarantine, people are dealing with. On the other hand, countries and
regions such as China, Iran, Wuhan, India and Italy, that were the most affected by the virus are cited. Note
that although India is knowing the phenomenon at the end of the studied period, we assume that it is evoked
among these countries because of its large population.

Figure 1. The 20 Top Hashtags of the dataset

4.2. Tweets sources
The sources from which the extracted tweets were published are shown in Figure 2. The most used platforms
are Android, iPhone and Web App with approximatively the same ratio.

4.3. Top Keywords
The 25 top words are shown in Figure 3. These terms are eloquent as they are similar to the words expressed
by the majority of people in real life. We observe four sets of words with approximatively the same respective
frequency, they are cited in a decreasing order of their occurrence:
-

virus, people
Flu, Cases, Trump, test
Spread, Health
Work, outbreak, death, update, home, China, hands, report, world, country, call, confirmed, infected,
week, risk, panic, pandemic

We can remark that these words describe all the situation people are overcoming in real life during this hard
period and that we can summarize in a few paragraphs.

4.4 Tweets number per date
The number of tweets by date experienced the results shown in Figure 4. Regarding the number of published
tweets, we find it significant during the period of this study and is changing from day to day. We remark that
before the advent of this virus in December 2020 in China, very few tweets on coronavirus were published.
These tweets consist in old tweets from the previous coronavirus versions that struck Asia in 2013, that were
retweeted again by some users. Figure 5 depicts the boxplot of the data collected during the study period,
where we see a non-asymmetric distribution of the tweets number and six outliers corresponding the following
days: 03/01/2020, 03/12/2020, 03/15/2020 for the lowest numbers of tweets and 03/06/2020, 03/14/2020 and
03/21/2020 for the highest numbers of tweets.

Figure 4. Number of tweets by date.

Figure 5. Boxplot on the number of tweets per day

4.5. Number of Tweets per country
The first ascertainment about the origin of the tweets is that a significant number of tweeters do not indicate
their country. Therefore, the results hereafter are valid only for those tweets with a provenance information.
Figure 6 shows the number of tweets per country where we observe that the majority of the published tweets
emanate from USA. The second remark is that tweeters belong to several countries from all the continents.
Note that the number of tweets is for some countries as important as their respective demography. For instance,

India is ranked 3th for the number of tweets while it has the second largest population in the world. The same
observation can be done for Nigeria and South Africa that count respectively the largest population in Africa.
Also, the countries the most affected by the virus such as Spain, France and Italy are present in this graph.

Figure 6. Number of tweets by country

4.6. Tweets Language
The language of tweets has also been explored, Figure 7 gives an insight about this feature. We note that
English prevails over the other languages. This can be explained by the fact that according to the previous
statistics, the three highest amount of tweets are originated from the USA, United Kingdom and India, where
the communication language is English. Also note that English is scientifically and technologically universal
and is written by a large population of other countries. Spanish is ranked 2 in this graph because it is spoken
in several countries like Colombia and Mexico that appear in the previous figure. Also the languages of the
affected countries with a high degree during this period except China exist all in this graph.

4.7 Correlations
We can think about several possible correlations between the parameters identified previously. In this
subsection, we investigate the correlation between the number of real infected cases and the number of tweets
published each day. The intuition is that the evolution of the number of infected cases urges people to
communicate via the social media. Figure 10 depicts the case of the UK, where in the x axis, we have the
number of tweets per day and in the y axis the number of the new cases tested positive to the coronavirus per
day. We observe a positive trend for the correlation confirmed by a Pearson coefficient equal to 0,55.

Figure 10. Correlation between the number of new cases and the number of tweets in the UK.

5. Tweets Sentiments Analysis
In addition to the previous study, a sentiment analysis was investigated aiming at capturing the tone of the
tweets. We know that during the COVID-19 period, people changed their behaviors and experienced different
feelings and emotions than those they have known before. Their lifestyle has shifted to something new. The
algorithm described in the next subsection was adopted and implemented to shed insight on tweeters
sentiments.

5.1. Sentiment Analysis Algorithm
The sentiment analysis algorithm we propose is based on the lexicon-based approach. As input, it takes the
set of the preprocessed words of the dataset and a sentiment lexicon. There are several known sentiment
lexicons that can be used for sentiment analysis. As examples we cite AFINN, Bing and NRC. AFINN
computes a score from the range [-5,5] to each word and deducts the positive sentiment if the score is positive
and the negative sentiment otherwise. Bing assigns straightly a positive or a negative sentiment to each word.
NRC considers ten categories of sentiments, which are positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear,
joy, sadness, surprise, and trust and assigns to each word at least one of these categories. We chose the NRC
lexicon as it provides specific sentiments other than positive and negative. This lexicon contains 6468 words
distributed over the ten categories. The number of words in each category is shown in Table 2.

The framework of the algorithm is shown in Figure 8. After the preprocessing step, the list of the words of the
whole dataset is determined. Meanwhile, the inverted file of the NRC is built and converted to a hash table.
Initially each category is affected a count set to 0. Then the process considers the words one by one and
calculates its hash key to access to the index that contains the address of the word in the lexicon. Once
identifying the entry of the lexicon inverted file containing the word, it captures the categories and increments
the count of each of them. Once the process is completed, the score for each category is computed as the ratio
of its corresponding count over the total number of words.
Figure 9 shows the results achieved by the execution of the algorithm, that illustrate the tone of the tweets
captured by the sentiment analysis. We observe that the negative sentiment has a score slightly greater than that
of the positive. Fear has an important score whereas joy and disgust have the lowest. Although this sad situation,
the tweeters seem to have trust in gaining the battle against the virus.

5.2. Sentiments Evolution
Figure 10 details the evolution of the sentiments during the four weeks. We notice that the negative sentiment
was high in the beginning of the period then it knew a little increase in the second week and since then it is
decreasing in an important degree. On the contrary, the positive sentiment follows the opposite behavior. Fear
has almost the same evolution as the negative sentiment but with less magnitude whereas trust behaves as the
positive sentiment with less importance. Joy is constant and is at the lowest score, which translates what people
are feeling during these days.

5.3. Sentiments Analysis by country
As tweets can be distributed by country as shown in Figure 6, the sentiments analysis can be carried out for
each country and each region by merging the tweets of the countries of the region in one dataset. Examples
for such task were performed for the USA and Canada separately and the region of North America. India has
also undergone such treatment. Note that the sentiments evolution can also be drawn for countries and regions.

5. Tweets Frequent Patterns and Association Rules
Mining
Data mining technology proposes a large spectrum of tools to extract interesting and potentially useful patterns
from huge and complex volumes of data. Association Rules Mining (ARM) is one of those techniques that
can be adapted to various domains such as health, commerce and industry. The generation of ARM is achieved
within two steps:
 Discovering Frequent Patterns or itemsets relative to a minimum support.
 Filtering ARM from the extracted frequent patterns with respect to a minimum confidence
The patterns for the tweets correspond to the most frequent words used in the tweets and hashtags, which
represent all insights on this social media for the COVID-19.
Since the algorithms for Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) are computationally expensive, a lot of research has
been carried on further improving their effectiveness and efficiency. And especially, in order to cope with the
main drawbacks of the Apriori and Eclat algorithms, the FP-Growth algorithm was developed [6]. The latter
was then selected to be adapted to our tweets dataset.

5.1 FP-Growth for generating frequent tweets patterns
The FP-growth algorithm draws its strength from the fact it uses a sophisticated and optimal data structure
called FP-tree that condenses only relevant data in a vertical format [6]. By scanning the tree, the frequent
words respecting the minimum support are determined. The algorithm for mining frequent tweets keywords
is outlined in Figure 11.
Algorithm: FP-Growth-Tweets
Input:
D the tweets dataset;
minsup, the minimum support count threshold.
Output: subsets of frequent keywords of length 1, 2, ...
Method:
1. Scan the dataset D once and find frequent words (single word pattern);
2. Sort frequent words in frequency descending order to constitute the f-list;
3. Construct FP-tree by scanning once more D;
4. For each path of the tree do
a. Repeat
i. l := 2 ;
ii. output all sub-paths (non-necessary consecutive) of length equal to l with minsup;
iii. increment l;
5. end
Figure 11. FP-Growth to mine twitter Data on COVID-19

The advantage of the f-list is to eliminate at the beginning those words that do not respect the minimum
support. Then the construction of the FP-tree considers only the f-list words and is consequently a data

structure reduced to only relevant information. It starts with an empty node, then it creates nodes taken
sequentially from the f-list and linking them if they belong to the same tweet while scanning the collection of
tweets and incrementing their frequency.

5.2 Association Rules Mining for Tweets on COVID-19
Association rules are derived from the frequent patterns calculated by the adapted FP-Growth algorithm.
Suppose {w1, w2, w3} are words appearing frequently in the tweets dataset with a minimum support equal to
minsup. Then from this subset of words (called itemset in the traditional frequent patterns mining algorithms),
we can generate 4 association rules that are:
→ w1, w2, w3 (minsup, minconf)
w1 → w2, w3 (minsup, minconf)
w1, w2 → w3 (minsup, minconf)
w1, w2, w3 → (minsup, minconf)
The first rule means that in all tweets, the three words exist. In the second one, the rule is interpreted as:
whenever w1 exists in a tweet, w2 and w3 appears in the same tweet. The other rules share the same meaning.
Note that we need to specify another measure for the rule besides the support, which is the confidence. The
confidence of a rule is defined to be the probability whenever an antecedent of the rule is in a tweet, the
consequent is also in the same tweet. It is calculated as:
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒(𝑟𝑢𝑙𝑒) =

𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡({𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡})
𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡({𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡})

5.3. Experimental Results
The adapted FP-growth algorithm was implemented in Java programming language under the following
environment: Windows 10 Intel core i5-7300U CPU at 2.60 Ghz, 8GB of RAM.
The most frequent words in the tweets published in English and calculated by the algorithm are reported in
Table 3 in decreasing order of their support. We can confirm that these words constitute an important part of
the daily vocabulary used by people nowadays in real life.

Similarly, the pair of words the most frequent appear in Table 4, which shows at the same time examples of
association rules ordered with respect to the minimum support on the total number of patterns equal to 19560.
These rules are impressively similar to those of the daily life during the pandemic. For instance, the rule wash
hand has the highest confidence, which corresponds exactly to what we hear many times a day.

Table 4. Examples of generated association rules with 2 frequent patterns

Table 5 and Table 6 show the association rules identified by the algorithm for respectively the 3 and 4 most
frequent patterns with a low support but a significant confidence. These rules are also eloquent relatively to
what people are living these days.

Conclusion and perspectives
Within the framework of this work, we were interested in investigating the people communication via social
media during the terrible starting period of the rapid spread of COVID-19 all along the world. Twitter was
selected to undertake the study because of the credibility of its users and also the ease of extracting the tweets.
As a first contribution, a dataset of 653 996 tweets was extracted using NodeXL and preprocessed in order to
highlight useful insights. As a second contribution, an exploratory study on the collection of tweets was
carried out to yield descriptive statistics. A sentiment analysis study followed and interesting results were
discussed. Data Mining technologies were afterwards exploited and the FP-Growth algorithm was especially
adapted to the tweets dataset in order to discover the most frequent patterns in an effective and efficient way.
The derived association rules highlight our understanding on the tweeters communicating on the COVID-19.
The global results were impressive and can enrich the information forecasted by the traditional media.
As a future work, other measures such as the lift and the interestingness will be considered for the experiments
of the frequent patterns mining with the purpose of improving the outcomes. Another possible research
direction is to explore the way and the acceleration the virus has been spread around the word, Density-based
clustering can be developed for this purpose.
