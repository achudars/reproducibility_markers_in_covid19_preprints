Abstract

26

Background

27

The number of confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases surge substantially in

28

resource-poor settings within the fragile health system. Since there are no proven vaccine and

29

treatment in place against the disease, controlling strategy mainly rely on preventive

30

measures. However, data on the extent of implementing physical distancing and other

31

preventive measures were under estimated. This study, therefore, investigated these gaps

32

among people in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia.

33

Methods

34

We conducted a community based cross-sectional study in Arba Minch town; from 15-30

35

June 2020. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and checklist.

36

Then, data were cleaned, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.4.2, and exported to SPSS

37

version 20 for analysis.

38

Results

39

Of the total participants (459), 43.6% achieved above the mean score (6±1.97) on preventive

40

measures of COVID-19. Only 29.8% of participants kept the recommended physical

41

distance, and surprisingly, in all public gathering places the distance was not kept totally. In

42

addition, of the total participants, only 37.7% had face-mask use practice; 20.5% had hand

43

sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% were measuring their body temperature every two weeks.

44

Moreover, 42.5% of participants avoided attendance in public gatherings; 44.7% stopped

45

touching their nose, eye and mouth; 55.6% practiced stay-at-home; and 60% had frequent

46

hand washing practice. Majority of participants (66.7%) practiced covering their mouth and

47

nose while coughing or sneezing; 68.2% had treatment seeking behavior if they experience

48

flue like symptoms; 69.1% practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms;

49

and 89.3% avoided hand shaking.

Conclusions

51

The findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive

52

measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an

53

urgent call for action is demanding to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 as early as

54

possible before it brings a devastating impact.

55

Introduction

56

The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious infectious disease, caused by

57

the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Co V-2) [1, 2]. On 30 January

58

2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General declared COVID-19 as public

59

health emergency of international concern [3] . Human-to-human infection due to SARS-

60

CoV-2 occurs mainly through air droplets, close contact with infected persons, particularly

61

mucus membranes secretions from nose, mouth, or eyes, contaminated surfaces, and some

62

studies suggest digestive tract transmission [4, 5]. Elder people and those with underlying

63

medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and

64

cancer have higher risk to develop serious illness and probably result in death [6-8].

65

Despite the level of advancement in health system, the daily World Health Organization

66

(WHO) Coronavirus situation reports highlight the fast spread of COVID-19 across the

67

United States, Europe and South East-Asia [9]. As of August 7, 2020, WHO report showed

68

that the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection has led 18, 614 177 cases (259 344

69

new) and 702, 642 deaths (6 488 new) globally in 215 countries. Of these, Africa accounts

70

848, 053 cases (13 906 new) and 15, 252 deaths (502) [9]. Although the number of confirmed

71

novel COVID-19 cases reported in resource-poor settings is still relatively lower, recently it

72

was noticed that cases substantially rise. However, there is a high likelihood the current

73

number represents underestimates due to inadequate test accessibility. Thus, these conditions

74

may change in the coming months [10].

75

In Ethiopia, the first case was reported in March 13, 2020, in 48-year old Japanese in

76

Addis Ababa [11]. As of August 7, 2020, 20 336 cases (46) and 356 deaths (13 new) were

77

reported [9].

78

The WHO advises people to implement different preventive measures against COVID-19

79

pandemic. According to the WHO recommendations, the best way to halt transmission of

80

human-to-human is being well informed about the virus, how it spreads and implementing the

81

preventive measures adequately [12]. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO

82

along with its partners has been leading global coordination to hold the spread and reduce

83

devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic [13].

84

Since the first incidence of the virus in Ethiopia, the country has been implementing

85

unprecedented measures to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 [14, 15].

86

However, anecdotally, it has been observed that communities in setting with strong social

87

interaction are neglecting physical distancing and other preventive measures of COVID-19.

88

Moreover, to best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that assess

89

implementation of preventive measures of COVID-19 among the general population in

90

Ethiopia. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the extent of physical distancing and

91

other preventive measures among people in Arba Minch town, Southern Ethiopia to inform

92

decision made on COVID-19.

Methods

101

Study setting

102

This study was conducted in Arba Minch town which is located at 505kms south of Addis

103

Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. The town has 11 kebeles (smallest unit of government

104

administration). Based on the 2007 census conducted by central statistical agency, the total

105

projected population for 2020 is 120, 736 (60, 127 men and 60, 609 women) [16]. As any

106

part of the country, the community members in Arba Minch town are at high risk for

107

Coronavirus infection due to existence of strong social interaction in the society which could

108

favour the virus transmission rapidly. Since the first incidence of COVID-19 cases in

109

Ethiopia, quarantine and treatment center have been established in the town. Currently, few

110

confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in Arba Minch town.

111

Study design and period

112

A community based cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the extent of physical

113

distancing and other preventive measures among people in Arba Minch town; from 15-30

114

June 2020.

115

Study population

116

The study population was head of household or any adult ≥18 years old in the selected

117

households who were residents and available during the survey period. Individuals were

118

excluded from the study in situation when they were seriously ill and unable to provide

119

information.

124

reliability coefficient of standard error at 5% level of significance = 1.96 and desired degree

125

of precision (d) of 5 %; the estimated sample size was 385, and by adding 20% non-response

126

rate, the total computed sample size was 462. Study participants were selected by systematic

127

random sampling technique from each kebele with consideration given to equal probability

128

proportionate to sample size. For physical distancing measure, from each public gathering

129

place, such as market, bank, church, ekub, hotels, bus station, and office distance between

130

any two or more individuals was measured.

131

Study variables

132

Variables included in this study were socio-demographic and economic characteristics,

133

source of information, knowledge and perception on prevention and control of COVID-19;

134

hygiene related factors, and implementation status of physical distancing, and other

135

preventive measures.

136

Data collection

137

Data were collected by house-to-house survey using interviewer administered questionnaire

138

and observation checklist. Data quality was maintained by developing, adapting and pre-

139

testing standardized tool (adapted from WHO guidelines); training of data collectors and

140

supervisors; and daily checking of consistency and accuracy of data.

141

Statistical analysis

142

Data were edited, coded and entered to Epidata version 4.4.2 and exported to SPSS version

143

25 software. Then, the data were cleaned, analyzed and outcome of the research were

144

presented by figures and tales. Implementing preventive measure was measured using 12

145

questions and score was computed by counting value within a case.

Status of implementing physical distancing

210

Of 55 surveyed public gathering places, the measured physical distances between any two or

211

more people were less than 1 meter in 81.8% (45) of places. In addition, the recommended

212

physical distance (at least 2 meters) was totally not kept in any of these places (Figure 2). On

213

the other hands, of the total respondents (459), only 29.8% (137) of participants self-reported

214

as maintained at least 2 meter distance outside their home (Table 4).

Status of implementing other preventive measures

222

We used 12 questions to assess implementation of preventive measures against COVID-19.

223

In total, 43.6% (200/459) of participants achieved above the mean score (6±1.97) on

224

preventive measures.

With regard to visiting crowded places, 54.9% (252/459) of participants visited market and

225

Of the surveyed individuals, only 37.7% (173/459) had face mask use practice, 20.5%

226

(67/326) had frequent hand sanitizer use practice, and 13.1% (60/459) were measuring their

227

body temperature every two week. Moreover, 42.5% (195/459) avoided going to public

228

gathering place in the last 7 days; 44.7% (205/459) stopped touching their nose, eye and

229

mouth; and 55.6 % (255/459) practiced stay-at-home if going outside is not mandatory; and

230

60% (254/423) had frequent hand washing practice. In addition, majority, 66.7% (306/459)

231

practiced covering their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing with cloth or tissue;

232

69.1% (317/459) practiced isolating themselves while having flue like symptoms; and mouth,

233

68.2% (313/459) had treatment seeking behavior if they experience flue like symptoms; and

234

89.3% (410/459) avoided hand shaking. Among those who did not use face mask, the main

235

mentioned reason was not having money, 45.5% (130/286), to purchase the mask (Table 4).

Discussion

261

This study explores data on adherence of people towards the recommended preventive

262

measures of COVID-19. As any part of the country, the community members in Arba Minch

263

town are at high risk for Coronavirus infection due to existence of strong social interaction in

264

the society which could favour the virus transmission rapidly in the community. However,

265

the findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive

266

measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town, southern

267

Ethiopia. While almost all participants (99.3%) were informed on COVID-19, our study

268

found out that only 43.6% of participants achieved above the mean score (6±1.97) on

269

preventive measures. On the contrary, data of our study revealed that 63.4% of participants

270

perceived as they were implementing the preventive measures against COVID-19.

271

In the current study, only 29.8% of participants self-reported as they kept at least 2 meters

272

distance outside their home, and in none of the public gathering places the recommended

273

physical distance (at least 2 meter) was not kept totally. The possible reason for low

274

implementation of physical distancing is probably due to the strong social interaction norms

275

that exist in the society. In consistent with this finding, a facility based study conducted in

276

another part of Ethiopia (Jimma) revealed that slightly higher practice of avoiding physical

277

proximity (33.6%) [17]. The higher report of keeping physical distance in Jimma probably

278

due to proximity was measured at a distance with minimum of 1 meter.

279

In this study, only 37.7% of participants had face mask use practice when leaving out

280

home, which is lower than the face mask use practice in Malaysia (51.2%) [18] . The lower

281

practice of face mask in our study might be due to lack of money to purchase face mask, as

282

justified by data of our study. Surprisingly, study participants in China demonstrated “as

283

high as 98% of respondents had face mask use practice” [19].

284

With regard to hand sanitizer use, this study showed that only 20.5% of respondents had

285

frequent use of hand sanitizer. The reason behind for low utilization of hand sanitizer in our

286

study might be lack of access to hand sanitizer at affordable cost.

287

In the current study, only 13.07% of participants were measuring their body temperature

288

every two week. The low practice of measuring body temperature is probably due to lack of

289

access to temperature screening service.

290

In our study, we observed that less than 50% (42.5%) of respondents avoided going to

291

public gathering places in the last 7 days. This result might be due to the fact that strong

292

social interaction norm exist in the society, and our data justified as many people move to

293

market areas to purchase their groceries. In consistent with this finding, a study conducted in

294

Jimma town, Ethiopia demonstrated that a higher avoidance of going to public gathering

295

place (53.8%) [17]. In addition, the finding of a study conducted in Malaysia showed a

296

significant higher difference in avoiding going to public gathering places (83.4%) [18].

297

With regard to stopping touching nose, eye and mouth practice, in our study, 44.7% of

298

participants stopped touching their nose, eye and mouth. This finding indicated that still more

299

intervention is required to bring behavioral change.

300

This study demonstrated that 55.6 % of participants practiced stay-at-home as preventive

301

measure. However, data of our study showed that substantial number of participants

302

mentioned that stay-at-home is very challenging as a result of economic problem, which force

303

people going outside their home to look for their daily breads.

304

Finding of the current study showed that only 60% of participant had frequent hand

305

washing practice. The inadequate hand washing practice observed in this study could be due

306

to lack of sustainable social behavioral change communication (SBCC). In consistent with

307

this result, findings of studies conducted in another part of Ethiopia, in Philippines and

308

Malaysia revealed much better hand washing practice [17, 18, 20].

309

Data of our study revealed that 66.7% of respondents had practice of covering their mouth

310

and nose while coughing or sneezing with cloth, mask or tissue. Inadequate mouth and nose

311

covering while coughing or sneezing with cloth, mask or tissue observed in this study could

312

be due to lack of sustainable social behavioral change communication (SBCC).

313

In the current study, 68.2% of participants had treatment seeking behavior if they

314

experience flue like symptoms. This might be due to people have high fear of the virus as it

315

could result in death.

316

Moreover, 69.1% of participants practiced isolating themselves while having flue like

317

symptoms. In consistent with this finding, a bi-national study conducted in Africa (Nigeria

318

and Egypt) showed that “as many as 96% of study participants practiced self-isolation and

319

social distancing” [21].

320

Furthermore, predominantly, this study demonstrated that as high as 89.3% of participants

321

avoided hand shaking. On the contrary, a lower practice of hand shaking was observed in a

322

study conducted at another part of Ethiopia (53.8%) [17].

323

The main strengths are that we could assess community’s adherence towards the

324

recommended preventive measures of the COVID-19 pandemic at community level, which

325

address an important national and global operational research priority.

326

While interpreting data presented in this study, the following limitations need to be

327

considered. First, findings are relied on self-reported practices of participants. Second, people

328

may report as they were implementing preventive measures due to social desirability.

329

Conclusions

330

The findings of this study suggest that physical distancing and other COVID-19 preventive

331

measures were inadequately implemented among people in Arba Minch town. Thus, an

332

urgent call for action is demanding in order to combat this dangerous infectious virus as early

333

as possible before it brings devastating impact. Further, studies focusing on barriers relate to

334

implementation of preventive measures against COVID-19 should be explored.
