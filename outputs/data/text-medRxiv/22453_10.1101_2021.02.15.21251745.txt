Key points
Question: Did NFL and NCAA football games with limited in-person attendance cause a substantial
increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the U.S. counties where the games were held?

Findings: This time-series, cross-sectional study of U.S. counties with NFL and NCAA football games
used matching and difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of games with limited in-person
attendance on county-level COVID-19 spread. Our study does not find an increase in county-level
COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents due to NFL and NCAA football games held with limited inperson attendance.

Meaning: This study suggests that NFL and NCAA games held with limited in-person attendance do not
cause an increase in COVID-19 cases in the counties they are held.

ABSTRACT
Importance: In 2020 and early 2021, the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) had opted to host games in stadiums across the country. The in-person
attendance of games has varied with time and from county to county. There is currently no evidence on
whether limited in-person attendance of games has caused a substantial increase in coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) cases.
Objective: To assess whether NFL and NCAA football games with limited in-person attendance have
contributed to a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases in the counties they were held.
Design: In this time-series cross-sectional study, we matched every county hosting game(s) with inperson attendance (treated) in 2020 and 2021 with a county that has an identical game history for up to 14
days (control). We employed a standard matching method to further refine this matched set so that the
treated and matched control counties have similar population size, non-pharmaceutical intervention(s) in
place, and COVID-19 trends. We assessed the effect of hosting games with in-person attendance using a
difference-in-difference estimator.
Setting: U.S. counties.
Participants: U.S. counties hosting NFL and/or NCAA games.
Exposure: Hosting NFL and/or NCAA games.
Main outcomes and measures: Estimating the impact of NFL and NCAA games with in-person attendance
on new, reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents at the county-level up to 14 days post-game.
Results: The matching algorithm returned 361 matching sets of counties. The effect of in-person
attendance at NFL and NCAA games on community COVID-19 spread is not significant as it did not
surpass 5 new daily cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents on average.
Conclusions and relevance: This time-series, cross-sectional matching study with a difference-indifferences design did not find an increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents in the counties
where NFL and NCAA games were held with in-person attendance. Our study suggests that NFL and

NCAA football games hosted with limited in-person attendance do not cause a significant increase in
local COVID-19 cases.

INTRODUCTION
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that mass in-person events have the
potential for significant spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[1]. To curb the spread of
COVID-19, states have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) with varying intensity,
including closure of work places, limit on indoor and outdoor gatherings, and travel restrictions[2]. Of
note, sporting events have been banned or cancelled due to the potential of mass gatherings to become
“super spreader” events[3].

In early 2020, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL)
temporarily suspended their 2019-20 seasons in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19. A few months
later, both leagues committed to resuming games in a “bubble” format where games were held in select
sites with no fan attendance. The NBA suspended their season a second time due to a strike, while the
NHL resumed their season with no interruption. In the late summer, the National Football League (NFL)
and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) made the decision to play games in their respective
stadiums, with many hosting in-person fans in a limited capacity. Despite various restrictions in place —
on sporting and non-sporting events, — COVID-19 cases continued to increase nationally from 4.62
million in August 2020 to 13.84 million in December 2020; the increase in cases varied across counties
and states[4].

However, the effect of limited in-person attendance in football games on the spread of COVID-19 in the
hosting counties is not well-understood. Despite the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines, strict
restrictions on holding large sporting events may remain in place until a herd immunity is achieved.

Hence, quantification of the effect of in-person football games attendance on the spread of COVID-19
could inform appropriate management decisions in future.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the historical NFL and NCAA football games with
limited in-person attendance have contributed to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the counties
they were held. We used a matching method and a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator suited for
time-series, cross-sectional data to estimate the effect of in-person attendance on the spread of new,
reported COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents.

METHODS
Data
We extracted NFL and NCAA game information, COVID-19 case counts, and COVID-19 policies and
interventions from public sources. We gathered information on NFL and NCAA games played in the
2020-2021 regular season, spanning 08/29/2020 to 12/28/2020 from Pro Football Reference[5]. Extracted
data included game dates, in-person attendance (yes/no), and the stadiums where the games were held.
We obtained stadiums’ longitude and latitude from Wikipedia[6]. Home stadiums’ longitude and latitude
were mapped to the corresponding U.S. county. We collected COVID-19 statewide non-pharmacological
interventions and policies from the COVID-19 U.S. State Policy Database (CUSP) with respect to
physical distance closures (closing non-essential businesses and closing restaurants except take-out), stayat-home orders (stay-at-home/shelter-in-place and end/relax stay-at-home/shelter-in-place), and second
closures and reopening (closing bars, reopening bars, reopening restaurants, and reopening non-essential
businesses)[7]. We obtained county-level populations from the 2019 U.S. Census Bureau Gazetteer
Files[8]. We computed county-level new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents using data from the
COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns
Hopkins University[9].

Statistical analyses
We quantified the effect of interest by comparing daily changes in COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents
in counties that have held NFL/NCAA games with limited in-person attendance with those that did not
hold NFL/NCAA games or have no attendance. This time series cross-sectional study used matching and
a DID design to estimate the Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT)[10].

The overall study design consisted of three major parts: (1) constructing initial matched set for each
treated county based on history of games, (2) refinement of the matched sets based on additional control
variables, and (3) ATT estimation using a DID estimator.

The treatment X!" is defined as whether county 𝑖 has had NFL and/or NCAA game(s) with in-person
attendance on date 𝑡. If there is a game with in-person attendance in county 𝑖 at date 𝑡, X!" is set to be 1. If
not, X!" is set to be 0. We define post-treatment period 𝐹 as the time period (days) following treatment,
which we set to 14 days due to the incubation period of coronaviruses[11]. Similarly, we define pretreatment period 𝐿 to be 14 days. The outcome of interest was the change in new, reported daily COVID19 cases per 100,000 residents from time 𝑡 to time 𝑡 + 𝐹, that is from day 0, 𝑡# , to day 14, 𝑡$% .

Constructing Initial matched set for each treated county
For each treated county X!" , a set of matched counties were determined based on pre-treatment and posttreatment game history such that matched counties should have identical game history from time 𝑡 − 𝐿 to
𝑡 − 1. Note that 𝑡 is fixed for both treated and matching counties, so that with the same time trend, we can
adjust for time-specific unobserved confounders later. Secondly, matched control units were excluded if
they had a game with in-person attendance after time 𝑡 but before the outcome is measured at time 𝑡 + 𝐹.
For each treated county 𝑋!" with 𝑋!" = 1 and 𝑋!,"'$ = 0, the matched set of counties is defined as:

to Three days. Bolded blue and red circles represent treatment observations. For each treatment, counties

selected counties get assigned to the matched set if their post-treatment period have no games (solid

Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of the matching procedure. Circled zeroes stand for counties
without games on that day, and circled ones mean at least one game happened. Bolded blue and red
circled ones represent treatment. For illustration purposes, assume both pre-treatment 𝐿 and posttreatment 𝐹 are equal to 3 (days). For the bolded blue one, there is a treatment in county A on 09/04. In
the first matching step, both county B and C are selected because they have the same treatment history as
county A (selected with dash-dotted rectangles). Though county E also has the same history, it is not
selected since it has treatment on 09/04. In the next matching step, county B is filtered out because it has a
treatment within three days after 09/04. Hence, only county C is in the matched set of bolded blue

treatment (with solid rectangles). In the next matching step, county B is filtered out because it has a
treatment within three days after 09/04. Hence, only county C is in the matched set of bolded blue
treatment (with solid rectangles). Similar matching procedures lead to no matched counties for bolded red
treatment. In brief, counties are matched counties only if they first have dashed-dotted rectangles around
past history and then have solid rectangles around future events.

Refinement of the matched sets based on additional controls
In the initial matching step based on history of games played, other control variables that may play an
important role in spread of the disease are ignored. However, in addition to the identical history of games,
we also need to ensure that treatment and control groups are similar based on factors that may influence
the disease epidemiology such as population size and presence of non-pharmaceutical interventions, as
otherwise the required parallel trends assumption for DID would not hold. In this step, we refine the
matching algorithm to account for such control variables and ensure the validity of parallel trends
assumption.

Every treated county X!" has up to 10 control counties selected from the matched set ℳ!" with
replacement. To this end, we use the average Mahalanobis measure to calculate the distance between
treated county and each matched county over time adjusting for covariates. As specified in the data
section above, covariates include COVID-19 statewide non-pharmacological interventions, policies, and
county-level population. Formally, the average Mahalanobis distance over pre-treatment history in our
study is defined as:

where 𝑖 ( ∈ ℳ!" is a matched county of X!" , COV!" is the time-varying covariates that we want to adjust
for, and S.,/ is the covariance matrix of COV!" . In other words, given a control county in the matched set,

we compute the standardized distance using the time-varying covariates, and average it over time. For
each treated county, we choose control counties with top ten smallest Mahalanobis distance, if there are
any, and assign equal weights to control counties in the refined matched set. Doing so implies that up to
10 most similar control counties under Mahalanobis distance are selected for the treated county:

average of control counties in ℳ!"∗ . For 𝐾 treated counties and 𝑇 observation days, the estimated average

We also performed sensitivity analyses by varying the pre-treatment period and post-treatment period. All
preprocessing of data and statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.3 (R-Core Team, 2020).
This study was deemed exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board due to the use of publicly
available data.

RESULTS
Out of 796 NFL and NCAA games played through 08/29/2020 to 12/28/2020, 528 games had in-person
attendance. NCAA game attendance numbers are not available publicly. The median (IQR) attendance at
NFL games through 08/29/2020 to 12/28/2020 was 11,133 (6,000 to 13,797) fans. Figure 2 shows the
distribution of NFL attendance.

The matching algorithm returned 361 matching sets. Covariate balance in the pre-treatment time period
between treated and matched control counties was assessed by computing the mean difference, measured
in terms of standard deviation units, for each time-varying covariate in the pre-treatment time period. The
standardized mean difference for the outcome and the other time-varying covariates stays relatively
constant over the entire pre-treatment period. Table 1 shows the estimated average treatment effect on the

Figure 3 provides a graphical representation of the average treatment effects over the post-treatment
period. Table 1 and Figure 3 suggest that the effect of in-person attendance at NFL and NCAA games is
not significant, as the average treatment effects are less than 5 daily new cases of COVID-19 per 100,000
residents. At 14 days after treatment, the average treatment effect estimate in daily new cases is 4.722 per
100,000 residents.

Table 2: Estimated average treatment effects of NFL and NCAA football games with in-person
attendance on the spread of COVID-19 over time with pre-treatment period of 14 days and posttreatment period of 21 days.

DISCUSSION
In this time-series, cross-sectional study of U.S. counties with NFL and NCAA football games, we used
matching and a difference-in-differences estimator to estimate the effect of games with in-person
attendance on county-level COVID-19 spread compared to games held without any fans. The study
considered the effect of both NFL and NCAA games since many counties had both an NFL or NCAA
game in the pre-treatment or post-treatment periods, hence the effect of NFL games alone or NCAA
games alone could not be studied separately. Games with in-person attendance were matched with a set of
control counties that share the same game history from time 𝑡 − 14 to 𝑡 − 1 days. We selected 14 days
based on numerous papers that found the incubation period for COVID-19 to be 2 to 14 days[11]. To
control for post-treatment bias, we apply the idea of marginal structural models by excluding control
counties that had a game with in-person attendance after time t but before the 14-day post-treatment
period is complete. We found that the average treatment effects on the treated of in-person attendance at
NFL and NCAA games on new, daily reported COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 residents) was not
significant over a 14-day period as they did not surpass 5 new cases per 100,000 residents. We surmise
that the NFL and NCAA policies with regards to limited in-person attendance, mask use and social plus
physical distancing measures in stadiums does not lead to a significant increase in the community spread
of COVID-19[12, 13]. Additionally, an important number of NFL and NCAA football stadiums are

outdoors or possess a retractable roof, which could’ve had an impact on mitigating spread[14].

There are limitations to this study. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assignment (SUTVA) assumption
stipulates that each unit receives the same form or version of the treatment[15]. The treatment in this
study, namely in-person attendance, was defined as a binary (yes or no fans) and therefore the results do
not capture the possible impact of differing attendance numbers (Figure 2) on the outcomes. When the
NCAA attendance numbers are made publicly available, additional sensitivity analyses can be performed
to establish whether varying attendance numbers have an impact on COVID-19 spread. We also did not
control for other large gathering events, such as political rallies, as some have been found to cause a local
spread in COVID-19 cases[16]. We also did not account for the spillover effects to the counties adjacent
to the ones hosting NFL/NCAA games. Finally, our analysis could not assess whether the Super Bowl LV
game held on February 7th, 2021 in Tampa, Florida is associated with an increase in the spread of
COVID-19 cases because of post-game celebrations.

Our study provides new information on the effect of football games with in-person attendance on
COVID-19 spread. This time-series, cross-sectional study with difference-in-differences design suggests
that NFL and NCAA games held with limited in-person attendance do not cause an increase in COVID19 cases in the counties they are held. Further research is needed to account for spillover effects to
counties adjacent to the ones hosting games. While COVID-19 vaccination has started, restrictions will
likely stay in place for several months and possibly until the start of the 2021-22 NFL and NCAA
seasons. Our study provides evidence suggesting that in-person attendance of football games with social
distancing and mask use could be resumed in the 2021-22 season.
