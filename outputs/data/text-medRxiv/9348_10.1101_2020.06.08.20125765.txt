Quantifying hospital flows and occupancy due to COVID19 outbreak in France. Was French lockdown effective?

David Ternant, EA 7501, Université de Tours, Tours, France.

Abstract
Context. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to a rapid and deadly pandemic which reached almost
all countries in the world in a few months. In most countries, rigorous measures of mitigation,
including national or subnational lockdowns were established. The present work aimed at
quantifying the effect of national lockdown in France on hospital occupancy.
Methods. A compartmental model describing patient hospital flows was developed, where the
effect of lockdown was quantified on the hospitalization rate. Model parameters were estimated
using nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling.
Results. French lockdown led to a hospitalization rate decreased by thrice from 12 days after its
beginning. However, lockdown may not to have decreased either hospital occupancy or deaths in
hospital, which would have been both decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was
started 20 and 30 days before this date, respectively.
Conclusion. The present work showed an intrinsic effect of lockdown to decrease hospital
burden, but its efficacy on hospital burden may have been increased if established sooner.

1 Introduction
After an outbreak in December 2010 in Wuhan (Hubei, China), Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) reached the rest of the world in less than two months. The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared on February 26 of 2020 that all continents were touched by
COVID-19 and declared pandemic situation on March 11. On May 22nd, more than 5 million of
cases and 330000 of deaths were recorded: most of deaths were recorded in USA (96363), United
Kindgom (36042), Italy (32486), France (28215), Spain (27940) and Brazil (20082) [1].
The report 9 of Ferguson et al. [2] suggested that COVID-19 may trigger not only dramatic
number of deaths, but also huge hospital overload and saturation of intensive care units (ICU).
Therefore, 87 countries have imposed national or subnational lockdowns [3]. In France, the first
COVID-19 cases were confirmed at the end of January, and the first death from COVID-19 was
recorded on February 28; a national lockdown, including overseas territories and departments,
was begun on March 17th and ended on May 11th in France [4].
Previous works that used compartmental deterministic mathematical models suggested and/or
confirmed substantial benefit of lockdown [5–9]. The validity of compartmental deterministic
models by themselves is usually agreed. However, since they are most often used as infection
and/or death count forecasts very early in epidemic histories, their (numerous) parameters have to
be fixed based on prior knowledge, which might lead to over- or under-predictions.
Compartmental models have been used in several fields, including medical research and
pharmacology, where compartmental models are usually estimated from data to quantify biologic
and/or pharmacologic phenomena, while no (or a few) parameter values are fixed from
assumptions. In this field, non-linear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling is used to estimate model
parameters with methods based on likelihood maximization or Markov-chain Monte-Carlo
(MCMC) methods [11–12].
If most of previous works used sound epidemic and/or mechanistic models to describe COVID19 outbreak, spread and hospital occupancy, none of them attempted to estimate models
parameters to quantify actual patient flows in hospital services and ICU or the influence of
lockdown on hospital occupancy. Therefore, the present study proposes to develop a
compartmental model describing hospital flows between hospital services, ICU, deaths and return
home, to estimate transfer flow rate constants, and to quantify the effect of lockdown in France
using NLME modelling.

2 Methods
2.1 Data extraction
The present work was made on French data which were collected from official databases [4].
Data that were considered were hospitalizations in (i) non-ICU units and (ii) in ICU units, (iii)
deaths in the hospital, and (iv) returns to home. These data were collected daily from March 1st
towards May 22nd of 2020. They were assessed by regions (or sub-regions) selected to keep
comparable number of patients within each unit. Indeed, regions were divided in smaller areas if
effectives were high, as in Ile-de-France, Grand-Est, Hauts-de-France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
and Provence-Alpes-Côtes d’Azur. Therefore, the following 26 regions or sub-regions were
assessed : Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Val-de-Marne, Seine-saint-Denis, Essonne, Yvelines, Val
d’Oise, Seine-et-Marne, Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin, Moselle, Grand-Est (other), Nord, Hauts-DeFrance (other), Rhône, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (other), Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence-AlpesCôtes d’Azur (other), Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, Centre-Val-de-Loire, Occitanie, NouvelleAquitaine, Pays-de-la-Loire, Normandie, Bretagne, Corse. Overseas departments and territories
were not assessed because of low effectives. No focus was made on COVID-19 cases, because no
systematic testing policy was implemented in France up to this date. Since COVID-19 cases were
not accounted, the model was made under the assumption of a constant ratio between cases
leading to hospitalization, and total cases.

The hospital flow model is described using a system of 9 ordinary differential equations. (figure
1). This model was obtained after having tested numerous possibilities. First, patient
hospitalization was described using a Kermack-McKendrick input function:
(E.1)
Where S is the number of subjects susceptible to be hospitalized, kI is hospitalization rate
constant, H1 is the number of hospitalized subjects and N is total number of subjects.
Hospitalized patients are assumed to be directed to heal, to die or towards ICU:

(

)

(E.2)

Where kDH, kH1 and kH2 are direction rate constants towards hospital death, hospital heal and
ICU, respectively. Because of a delay between hospital admission and death, decease in hospital
is described using the following equation:
(E.3)
Where H2 is the number of hospitalized patients in non-ICU services bound to die, kHD and kDH
are input and output rates constants, respectively. Because early attempts showed that patients
bound to live and to die present different kinetics, they were described using separate equations.
Therefore, the kinetics of patients that heal from hospitalization is described as follows:
(E.4)
Where H3 is the number of hospitalized patients (not in ICU) bound to heal. Early attempts
showed a delay between admission in hospital and in ICU. In addition, as for hospital patients,
patients bound to heal or die in ICU present different kinetics and were therefore described in
separate equations. Thus, the following compartment described the transfer of patients toward
ICU as follows:

(

)

(E.5)

Where H4 is the number of patients in tansit compartment which describes a delay of patient
direction towards ICU, and kR and kRD are direction rate constants toward heal or death paths in
ICU, respectively. The kinetics of atients bound to heal for ICU is described as follows:
(E.6)

Where R1 is the number of patients bound to heal in ICU and kG2 is ICU heal rate constant. The
kinetics of patients bound to die in ICU is described as follows:

(E.7)

Where R2 is the number of patients bound to die in ICU and kDR is ICU death rate constant. Dead
(D) and healed (G) patients were described using the following equations:
(E.8)
(E.9)

Initial time (t=0) was fixed on the December 31st of 2019, to set January 1st of 2020 as day 1. The
system was initialized by estimating the time of the first patient to be hospitalized, i.e. tfirst such as
H1(t=tfirst) = 1. All other equations were assumed to be equal to 0 at t = tfirst. The number of
hospitalized patients outside ICU (H), in ICU (R) were respectively assumed to be H = H2 + H3
and R = R1 + R2. The influence of French lockdown was assumed to decrease the hospitalization
rate constant as follows:
kIL = kI . α if t > teffect
kIL = kI if t  teffect
Where α is a coefficient between 0 and 1 and teffect is the time from which lockdown effect was
detected.

2.3 Parameter estimation
The following 14 parameters were estimated: tfirst, N, kI, kHD, kDH, kH1, kH2, kG1, kR, kRD, kDR, kG2,
α and teffect. Parameter estimation was made using non-linear mixed-effects (NLME) modelling.
This approach has been used since the early 70’s in the field of quantitative pharmacology [10–
11]. The main goals of NLME modelling were to determine the distribution of the values of the
parameters of interest in a group of individuals, i.e. regions (and sub-regions) of France; data
from all regions or sub-regions were computed simultaneously to estimate (i) the “mean”
(referred as “typical”) value of each parameter, (ii) the inter-region variability (referred as
“interindividual variance”) and (iii) to estimate parameter values for each region using Bayesian
methods.
Software. Hospital data were analysed using MONOLIX-Suite 2019 software. (Lixoft®, Antony,
France), which combines the stochastic expectation-maximization (SAEM) algorithm and a
Markov Chain Monte-Carlo procedure for likelihood maximization. To ensure the best possible
convergence, a large number of iterations (15000 for K1 and 2000 for K2) were used. K1 and K2
refer to the SAEM procedure of MONOLIX, called “iterative kernels”. During K1, the sequence
of step sizes is constant, which allows the exploration of the parameter space. During K2, the step
sizes decrease to ensure convergence. Three Markov chains were used. Parameter values of
regions, sub-regions and whole France were obtained by computing conditional distribution.

Structural model design. Model with and without lockdown effect on kI were compared using
Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), defined as: AIC = OFV + 2.p, where OFV is the value of
the objective function and p is the number of model parameters to estimate. The use of AIC is
based on the parsimony principle aiming at a satisfactory fitting of the data with a small number
of parameters. The model with the lowest AIC was selected.
Statistical (inter-region) model. The inter-region variability of parameters was described using an
exponential model: θi = θTV . exp(ηi), where θi is the estimated individual parameter, θTV is the
typical value of the parameter and ηi is the random effect for the ith patient. The values of ηi were
assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance ω2. The variability of parameter α,
assumed between 0 and 1, was described using a probit model.
Error model. Additive, proportional and mixed additive-proportional models were tested. For
example, the combined additive-proportional model was implemented as follows: YO,ij = YP,ij.(1+
εprop,ij) + εadd,ij where YO,ij and YP,ij are observed and predicted jth marker measurements for the ith
patient, respectively, and εprop,ij and εadd,ij are proportional and additive errors, which are assumed
to follow a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variances σprop2 and σadd2, respectively.
Model evaluation. Models were evaluated graphically using goodness-of-fit diagnostic plots:
observed vs. population (PRED) and individual (IPRED) fitted concentrations; population
(WRES) and individual (IWRES) weighted residuals vs. PRED and IPRED, respectively.

2.4 Simulations
Typical estimates of model parameters (table 1) were used to simulate the effect of lockdown on
H, R, D and G data in time. The value of N0 was converted as its value per 100,000 capita
(N0*=170). The following scenarii were simulated: no lockdown, actual lockdown (on the March
17th of 2020), and lockdown started 10, 20 and 30 days before this date.

3 Results
Data of patient hospitalization in non-ICU services (H, figure 2A), in ICU (R, figure 2B), deaths
in hospital (D, figure 2C) and return to home (G, figure 2D) were satisfactorily described by the
hospital flow model. Best error models were mixed additive-proportional for all measurements.
All model parameters were estimated with good accuracy (table 1). No estimation collinearity
was observed. The plots of predicted vs. observed measurements showed good model fitting
(figure 3). Individual weighted residuals showed no obvious bias or model misspecification
(figure 4). Accounting for lockdown model led to a real improve in data description, with a
decrease in AIC of 1057.02 (AIC = 81072.13 and 80015.11 without and with lockdown effect,
respectively).
If the inter-region variability of parameters related to disease itself was low (< 40% for t first, N0
and kI), this variability was much higher for parameters related to hospital flows (between 40%
and 95%), and surprisingly high for lockdown effect (130% for α). The lower the α, the higher
the lockdown effect on kI (table 2). For instance, lockdown was very effective in Ile-de-France
(α=0.013), while less efficient in Grand-Est (α=0.52) or Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (α=0.38).
On the global France data, a poor effect of lockdown was observed (α=0.89). Of note, no interregion correlation was found between parameters related to disease and related to lockdown (α,
teffect).
The time for which the first patient was hospitalized in France corresponds to the initiation of the
system effect such as H1(t=tfirst) = 1, at day 47, which corresponds to the February 17th of 2020.
French lockdown started one month later, on March 17th of 2020 (day 76); the effect of lockdown
was detectable 12 days after this date in whole France (day 88, table 2), variable among
(sub)regions.
Simulations suggested that lockdown did not substantially decrease either hospital occupancy or
deaths in hospital. They also suggested that lockdown effect would have been increased if started
before its actual date. Indeed, hospital occupancy and deaths in hospital would have been both
decreased by 30% and 85% in average if lockdown was started 20 and 30 days before this date,
respectively. (figure 5).

Legends: N0* : number of patients bound to be hospitalized per 100,000 capita. Date of first admission is an estimate of the date where the first
patient was hospitalized such as H1(t = tfirst) = 1, lockdown after delay is the number of days after which lockdown effect is detected since
lockdown date on March 17th of 2020. Other abbreviations are found in the text.

4 Discussion
This work has focused on available data to estimate the actual effect of lockdown on
hospitalization burden in regions and sub-regions of France. This model allowed an accurate
description of patient flows between non-ICU services, ICU, deaths at hospital and return to
home. Adding the effect of lockdown allowed an even better description of hospital data.
A previous work suggested that French lockdown would have prevented almost 600,000 hospital
admissions, including almost 150,000 in ICU [9]. However, this work has been criticized,
because of a possible over-estimation of hospital burden [12]. The principle of lockdown itself
remains controversial. Introduced for the first time in human history in 2020 instead of isolation
or quarantine, it may lead to a large social cost while being less efficient than isolation or
quarantine measures [13]. To deal with this controversy, the present hospital flow model was
attempted to either validate or invalidate the following hypothesis: “lockdown has decreased
hospital burden in France”. This necessitated a sound description of patient input/flows/output in
hospital.
This study showed a significant effect of lockdown on hospitalization rate (kI), with a global
decrease of kI by thrice. However, the consequences of lockdown appeared to be minor:
simulations made from the hospital flow model suggested that lockdown have had no significant
influence on hospital burden and would have saved less than 1 life per 100,000 capita, compared
to the 22 per 100,000 who have died until the day May 22nd [14]. There may be at least three
explanations: first, the effect of lockdown is delayed in time (detected 12 days after start of
lockdown in average), second, hospital occupancy was already high at this date and, last, but not
least, the risk of infection may have already started to decline [14]. Nevertheless, the effect of
lockdown, as well as patient flow parameters, was found to be very variable among regions and
sub-regions of France. This variability may be due, at least in part, to population density in each
region, different hospital cares, different population characteristics (inter-region differences in
mean age, co-morbidities, etc.), and/or to the respect of mitigation strategies.
If an intrinsic effect of lockdown measures seems indisputable, one could question the date of
establishment. Indeed, simulations showed that both hospital occupancy and deaths would not
have been significantly different if no lockdown was established, but they might have been
dramatically decreased if lockdown had been started 20 or 30 days started before the official date
of application. Nevertheless, at these days, the first death from COVID-19, and the first case were
respectively recorded.
This work has nevertheless limitations. First, all French sub-regions were not considered, in order
to keep N0 sufficiently high in each region unit and to avoid very long time of computation. In
particular, overseas territories were not considered, except for Corse. Second, even if accurate
values of model parameters were obtained in each region, notably the time of the first
hospitalized patient, no spatial description of disease spread was made. Third, this model does not
pretend to be an epidemic model: the hospital admission growth was described using a KermackMcKendrick input function, which may appear oversimplistic. This also concerns the “on/off”
model for lockdown effect, which may not account for the complexity of the real effect of

lockdown. Therefore, this model cannot test lockdown ending strategies and their consequences
on the risk and amplitude of epidemic rebounds. To describe or forecast these rebounds, a
mechanistic epidemic model as Roux et al. [9] could elegantly replace the present input function.
Last but not least, this model is “macroscopic”, i.e. does not account for patient specificities (as
age distribution or proportion of comorbidities). Taking into account these factors may improve
the description of inter-region variability [14]. Given these limitations, the lockdown effect
should be considered with caution, this study providing trends more than a sound quantification.
In conclusion, the present model has shown an intrinsic effect of lockdown to decrease hospital
burden. However, the efficiency of lockdown may have been increased if established sooner.
This may raise important questions, notably regarding social acceptability of these rigorous
measures that would have imposed while no strong signal of danger was present.
