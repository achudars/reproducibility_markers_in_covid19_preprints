Abstract
Wastewater-based monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 holds promise as tool to inform public healthdecision making. Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of
preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not
been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary
sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic
methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized
sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory
complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case
counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation
from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However,
if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would
be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for
detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not
distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Future work must focus on methods to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to
widely deploy this promising wastewater surveillance tool.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious
respiratory virus with a case-fatality rate of 1-2% 1. Mask-wearing has been shown to reduce the
spread of SARS-CoV-2, thereby decreasing the incidence of Covid-19, the illness caused by
SARS-Cov-2 2. Because people are unlikely or unable to wear masks at all times while they are in
their homes, congregate living settings (e.g. nursing homes, prisons, etc.) have been
disproportionately impacted by large outbreaks in the pandemic thus far 3-6. Approaches to limit
transmission in such settings have included aggressive entry screening via wellness attestations
and/or temperature checks 7, 8; however, the effectiveness of these strategies has been hampered
by the fact that an infected individual is contagious prior to or without ever exhibiting symptoms
9-11
. To prevent outbreaks in congregate living settings, there is urgent need for frequent
surveillance to quickly detect new cases and isolate them from other occupants 12, 13. Frequent
testing, of all occupants could be an effective means of identifying and separating contagious
individuals and quarantining others 3, 4, 14. However, there are significant logistical considerations
associated with testing all occupants repeatedly; cost, personnel, test availability, privacy,
compliance, testing fatigue, occupant anxiety15.
Stool has high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA early in infection with persistent shedding at
lower concentrations for weeks after infection 16, 17. Some groups have been able to recover live
virus from stool, but feces appears to contain predominantly non-viable RNA fragments, at
surprisingly high concentrations 16, 17. Fecal detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, coupled with the
strong need for passive routine surveillance, has prompted strong interest in wastewater-based
testing (WBT) as means to monitor for prevalence of the virus 16, 18. Recent published work
documents the potential usefulness of this strategy at a community level (e.g., via sampling at a
municipal wastewater treatment facility) 19-24. A working group comprising water and wastewater
professionals from academia and public practice have asserted that, “wastewater surveillance in
sewersheds is a rapidly developing area of research that has the potential to inform public health
policy decisions in the context of the current pandemic.” 25.
There is rapidly emerging interest in wastewater-based monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the
individual building level for various congregate living settings (e.g., prisons, university dorms) 26,
27
. It is anticipated that pooled wastewater-based testing of could act as early surveillance of all
building occupants. Wastewater results could be used to help determine where and when point
prevalence and/or other public health interventions are warranted, as means to prevent further
spread of Covid-19 but avoid the logistic barriers of frequent massive individual testing. There
have been popular (lay) press reports about how this approach has been implemented for various
university dormitories; e.g., at the University of Arizona, Syracuse University, and Pennsylvania
State University. However, there is no clarity or standardization among the protocols that have
been used thus far, nor is there any agreement on what constitutes best practices for implementation
of this approach 28. Among this group, work from Syracuse University offers the greatest amount
of technical detail, but additional investigation and external validation are still needed 27.
The overarching objective of this work was to evaluate the hypothesis that frequent monitoring of
pooled wastewater samples could be an efficient means of monitoring for Covid-19 cases among
building occupants. Three specific objectives were pursued: 1) establishing a robust strategy for
collecting representative wastewater samples from occupied congregate living settings; 2)
comparing and optimizing molecular diagnostic techniques; and 3) validating results based on

external data. We collected wastewater samples from several populations of individuals
undergoing frequent clinical testing for Covid-19; in a hospital and several occupied university
dormitories. We also analyzed municipal water and wastewater samples.
Methods and Materials
Sampled Settings
Hospital. The hospital setting was a newly constructed tower at University of Virginia (UVA)
Medical Center. This tower contains 84 rooms over three occupied floors but was only at roughly
40% occupancy during this study. The new tower opened in early April 2020 and during the study
period it was used for isolation and/or treatment of only Covid-19 patients or individuals needing
to quarantine after exposure to Covid-19. Both acute care and intensive care unit Covid-19 patients
are housed in this location. All rooms are single occupancy, with separate attached-bathroom
harboring a toilet, a sink and enclosed by a door. Mobile patients use the toilets. Based on infection
control guidance, and in consultation with nursing staff, the protocol is to dispose of stools from
immobile patients (via rectal tube, bedpan, or commode) via the toilet within each room. However,
small stools are sometimes captured onto pads that are disposed of into the solid waste stream.
Dye-based point source tracking was performed to confirm that candidate wastewater sampling
locations were hydraulically connected with the desired patient rooms as well as measure transit
time. Approximately 100 mL of a commercial liquid dye (FLT/Yellow-Green, Bright Dyes,
Miamisburg, OH) was introduced via a patient-room toilet or solid waste hopper. The toilet was
then flushed continuously for 2.5 min to push the dye through the wastewater collection system.
Visual monitoring at downstream locations was used to confirm flow connectivity and estimate
transit times.
Occupied dormitories. The dorm settings were two complexes located approximately 0.5 km
apart from each other. Both complexes contain multiple apartment-style buildings. Complex A
comprises five individual buildings, each containing 20 units. Each unit contains two singleoccupancy bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms, and shared kitchen. Complex B comprises three
individual buildings, each containing 15 units. Each unit contains four single-occupancy
bedrooms, a single shared bathroom, and a single shared kitchen. Neither location was at full
occupancy during the study interval. Many of the building occupants were student-athletes who
were required to wear masks and encouraged to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene.
Enhanced cleaning protocols were used in the dormitories to avoid widespread transmission.
Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The Moores Creek Advanced Water Resource Recovery
Facility in Charlottesville, Virginia is a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operated
by the Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority (RWSA). Its design flow rate is approximately 15
million gallons per day (MGD). Its service population is approximately 143,000 including UVA.
It serves the City of Charlottesville plus some portions of the surrounding Albemarle County.
Private residence. Municipal tap water was collected from a private residence (four full time
occupants) located within the same distribution network that serves the UVA Hospital and sampled
dormitories.

Sampling protocols
We adhered to CDC protocols pertaining to safe handling of sanitary wastewater during all
sampling events, with the following modifications 29, 30. All operators wore cloth or paper nonN95 masks, protective eyewear or a face shield, a disposable liquid impermeable gown, and
gloves. Alcohol based hand hygiene was practiced before and after sampling. All equipment
surfaces that came into direct contact with the wastewater were flushed with a 10% bleach (vol/vol)
solution. Contact times during equipment sanitization was at least 5 min, followed by multiple
rinses with tap water to remove bleach residue. Care was taken to have the collection done
principally by a single person wearing full PPE, assisted by another person. Earliest samples from
the UVA hospital constituted grab samples, whereby a small container was attached to a long pole
and held underneath the outfall to collect volumes of 5-6 liters, over a period of 10-15 minutes.
For composite samples autosamplers (Sigma 900 Max and AS950) (Hach, Loveland, CO) were
employed with running a time-weighted sampling program over periods of approximately one day
(20-24 h). Several different sampling programs were attempted, to balance battery life with
sampling frequency over the desired interval. Time interval between successive samples was 1030 min between successive samples, whereas collected volumes were 30-50 mL per sampling
event. For the majority of the study, the standard program was 30-mL samples collected every 15
min. Under especially low flow conditions, it was sometimes necessary to tape over parts of the
sample collection probe (strainer) to exclude air and improve sample draw. Auto-samplers were
packed with ice during sample collection. At the end of each sampling interval, samples were
immediately transported to a laboratory and processed the same day.
Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority personnel provided 1-L samples of their composited raw
influent as well as 50-mL samples of the solids from the underdrain of their primary clarifiers
(“primary solids”). Compositing starting at 12 am, and samples were collected at roughly 10 am.
All samples were transported to lab on ice and processed on the same day that they were collected.
Approximately 60 mL of tap water from a private residence were collected 1-2 times per hour over
a 24-hour period. The sample was refrigerated during collection, transported on ice to the
laboratory, and processed the same day.
Molecular Methods
Four wastewater RNA concentration methods and two extraction assays for analysis of SARSCoV-2 in wastewater matrix were assessed. The four concentration methods were: 1)
electropositive filtration 31, 2) ultracentrifugation with a sucrose gradient 27, 3) polyethylene glycol
(PEG 8000) precipitation 32, and 4) an alternative PEG precipitation based on a protocol from the
MIT Alm Lab and Biobot Analytics 19.
For the electropositive filtration method, 6 liter of wastewater were passes through a ViroCap™
filter (Scientific Methods, Granger, IN, USA) to collect negatively charged viral particles. The
viral RNA was then eluted in a solution of 1.5% beef extract and 0.05 M glycine (pH = 9.5) and
subjected to a secondary concentration step via flocculation in a 5% skim milk solution 28.

For the ultracentrifugation method, 40 mL of a mixed wastewater sample was added to an
ultracentrifuge test tube (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN)). Then 24 mL of a concentrated
sucrose solution (50% sucrose in TNE buffer) was carefully pipetted underneath the sample to
create two distinct layers. Samples were spun down in a Beckman Coulter LE80 Ultracentrifuge
for 45 minutes at 42,000 rpm (~150,000 x g). Supernatant was decanted, and pellet was
resuspended in 300 mL PBS27.
The third and fourth concentration methods utilized polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) to precipitate
virus particles. To apply the PEG precipitation method of Hjelmsø et al, 200 mL of mixed
wastewater was combined with 25 mL of glycine buffer (3% beef extract, 0.05 M glycine, pH =
9.6). The mixture was then centrifuged at 8,000x g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered
using a 0.45-μm PES membrane. PEG 8000 (80 g/L) and NaCl (17.5 g/L) was added to the filtered
supernatant and incubated with the mixture overnight at 4 °C under agitation. Samples were the
centrifuged at 13,000xg for 90 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS. By the
fourth method (Biobot) 120 mL mixed wastewater was filtered through a 0.22-uM filter and
combining the filtrate with 12g PEG 8000 and 2.7g of NaCl. The sample was shaken for 15 min
to fully dissolve PEG/NaCl and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 h. Supernantent was discarded
and sample was re-centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min to collect particulates. Resulting supernatant
was decanted from the tube, and the pellet was re-suspended in Trizol.
The RNA concentrated pellets from all methods were then processed using two commercial RNA
extraction kits: QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and NucleoSpin RNA
Plus Kit (Takara Bio USA Inc, USA). Manufacturers’ protocols were followed as written, with the
addition of a dithiothreitol (DTT) pretreatment step for the QiaAmp kit to attempt to decrease PCR
inhibition. For the pretreatment step, DTT, 500mM final concentration, was added at equal
volumes to sample volumes and vortexed thoroughly. Mixtures were then incubated at room
temperature for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. For all experiments, the PCR assay was run
on the ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosciences) using primers and methods
to amplify RNAseP (Rp) (PCR human control), N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2 viral targets, as specified
in the CDC protocol for SARS-CoV-2 analysis 33, 34. We recorded cycle threshold (Ct) values for
all analyses. All runs have a positive, negative and water blank control. The criterion for a positive
result was the same the cutoff for clinical diagnostic testing; namely, that Ct values for N1, N2
were ≤45. The RP control was present to evaluate for inhibition but if positive and negative control
were successful a positive could be determined with a negative Rp. Negative samples
corresponded to Ct values >45 for N1 and N2, with RP ≤ 45 and indeterminate were when only
one target was positive.
Results Validation and Interpretation
Most patients present in the Covid-19 tower on hospital sample days had undergone SARS-CoV2 PCR testing prior to admission or when they were first admitted. This testing could have been
performed by UVA’s in-house clinical laboratory (Cepheid Infinity, Abbott m2000 or Abbott
Allinity), or at an outside hospital on another platform. Individual patient charts were reviewed to
collect the following information: date of initial positive Covid-19 test and date of symptom onset
and total tower occupancy (IRB# 22521).

For the sampled dormitories, all occupants were required to undergo midturbinate nasal swab
SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing (Abbott Alinity or m2000 Chicago, Il) (weekly Complex A or biweekly
Complex B) throughout the study interval. Once an occupant tested positive they were not retested. The individual then isolated for 14 days starting from the test result date. These tests were
not undertaken as part of this study. The research team did not have access to individual charts for
dorm occupants but were provided with testing results in aggregate form, thus this was determined
to not be human subjects research.
Sensitivity analysis was done with number of known occupants in a building or catchment as the
reference for test performance 35. We assumed that one or more persons in a building who were in
the infectious period of 0-14 days from PCR positivity with or without symptoms would be the
reference method for positive18. Basic statistical calculations were performed using the Microsoft
Excel Data Analysis Toolpak (Excel 2019).
Results
Preliminary Sampling and Methods Comparison – Hospital and WWTP
After several repeated, definitively negative results from the hospital, mostly collected by grab
sample, dye testing was used to confirm hydraulic connectivity between patient rooms and
candidate testing sites. Two early dye tests in the hospital tower revealed that wastewater from
the Covid-19 unit was not accessible via several manholes initially considered to be promising
sampling locations. This outcome prompted a third set of dye tests in a new outflow location, in
which it was observed that transit time from a toilet in an unoccupied patient room to several
accessible candidate location was approximately 2-3 min. Travel time from a soiled waste hopper
on the same floor was also in this time range. Grab samples collected from manholes downstream
of the Covid-19 tower, where its wastewater commingles with flow from the rest of the hospital,
yielded inconclusive results (data not shown). Therefore, all subsequent hospital samples were
collected from a cleanout valve located just upstream of where the wastewater exits the building.
Overnight composite samples (typically 22-24 h intervals) were collected from this location with
30 mL every 15 minutes as the typical setting. Average daily flow rate for days on which hospital
samples were collected was 9.0-13.5 gallons per minute.
Composite samples of hospital wastewater, as well as raw influent and primary solids from the
WWTP, were used to compare SARS-CoV-2 published concentration and extraction protocols 23,
36-39
. Results are summarized in Table 1. An immediate observation from these results is that
SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in wastewater from individual buildings and WWTP samples
although the various methods had variable ability to detect.
Although only compared at a single time point, of the four evaluated concentration protocols, ultracentrifugation demonstrated less inhibition and more positive results for both hospital wastewater
and WWTP raw influent during preliminary sampling. The third wastewater, WWTP primary
solids, did not require concentration because it rapidly self-settled by gravity, making it
straightforward to collect a pellet. In contrast, each PEG protocol had lower yield with a positive
result for both sample types sample types but only with the Nucleospin extraction and the Ct values
were higher compared to the Ultracentrifuge method with the same extraction32, and WWTP raw

influent for the BioBot technique19 did not work on the WWTP with either extraction method but
worked on the hospital with the Nucelospin extraction but with higher Ct values. The
electropositive filtration technique resulted in 2 positives and 1 inhibited sample across the tested
hospital sample.
Regarding extraction, the NucleoSpin protocol yielded 7 positive results out of 8 trials during sideby-side methods comparison. The positives were spread across all three kinds of evaluated samples
(hospital wastewater, WWTP raw influent, and WWTP primary solids). In contrast, the QiaAmp
protocol with and without DTT yielded only 3 positive results out of 11 trials (Fischer exact
p=0.02), and none of the positives corresponded to WWTP raw influent samples. Six out of the 11
QiaAmp and one of the 15 (Fischer exact p=0.02) extracted samples failed internal control QC,
which monitors sample inhibition of the enzymatic PCR reaction. Post-extraction treatment of the
QiaAmp samples with DTT improved SARS-CoV-2 detectability; i.e., decreasing Ct value
compared to an identical sample without DTT, and transforming what would have been an
inhibited/failed sample into a positive result. However, for samples treated using the same
concentration protocol, it was observed that NucleoSpin extraction gave lower Ct values than
QiaAmp extraction followed by DTT treatment.
Based on results from the side-by-side method comparison (Table 1) and other factors (see
discussion), ultra-centrifugation followed by NucleoSpin extraction was selected for continued use
in this study. Additional samples were then collected from the hospital and WWTP over a period
of several weeks. Table 2 summarizes resulting Ct values for these samples, plus one sample of
municipal tap water collected from a location within the distribution network servicing the UVA
hospital and dorms. Table 2 also presents relevant Covid-19 case count comparators for each
hospital and WWTP sampling date; namely, corresponding patient census data and known cases
within the WWTP catchment area, respectively.
Sampling from Individual Occupied Dormitories
GIS plans were used to identify sampling locations within two occupied dorm complexes. Figure
1A shows the locations of three sampling sites within Complex A: one manhole collecting flow
from all five buildings (red star), plus two building-level cleanout pipes (labeled “A” and “R” on
Buildings 4 and 5, respectively). Figure 1B shows the location of the single sampling site in
Complex B, which was a manhole collecting flow from all three buildings in the complex.
Thirteen samples were collected from Complex A, corresponding to 0-3 samples per week over 8
weeks. Approximately 105 occupants were living in Complex A where the wastewater was
collected as the manhole test collection during this period. Four samples were collected from
Complex B, corresponding to 0-2 samples per week over four weeks. Sixty-six occupants were
living in Complex B during this period and all wastewater was collected at the sampled manhole.
Table 3 summarizes Ct values for samples from both complexes, alongside known case counts by
week.
It was observed that the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with increasing duration between
sample collection and processing. Although the number of samples is small, Ct values for sub8

samples of hospital and dorm wastewater processed on the day of sample collection were slightly
lower than Ct values for the same samples processed one day later. Relevant samples for both
preliminary comparisons, NucleoSpin versus QiaAmp and same-day versus next-day processing,
are highlighted in Tables 2 and 3.
Finally, results from additional secondary sampling locations within Complex A (i.e., cleanout
valves A and R) reveal that is it possible to monitor multiple locations within a single building at
the same time. However, the clean-out valve A was only sampled at a single time point there was
a known positive occupant within 14 days of a positive test in building 4 but no SARS-CoV-2 viral
targets were detected. Of note during this time period in the clean-out valve the overall flow was
very low in volume. Monitoring the building (cleanout value R) with no positive known occupants
within the complex gave consistently negative results.
Validation and Interpretation of Wastewater Results
Ct measurements for the different wastewater sample types were compared with known Covid-19
case counts over time within each sampled building or catchment area. The goal of these
comparisons was to: 1) assess the validity of positive/negative determinations arising from
wastewater testing; and 2) evaluate whether numerical Ct values and case counts over time are
mathematically correlated. During the testing period for the inpatients the average time from
symptom onset of and positive PCR was 15 and 11 days respectively and thus there were patients
within the contagious period (0-14 days from symptom onset/PCR positivity) 16, 18 from all hospital
time points and thus all wastewater was anticipated to be positive from infectious cases. There
were no new cases in Complex A after week 2 and thus the infectious period of all occupants
would have ended by week 4.
If we evaluate only the Nucleospin conclusive results across hospital and dormitory and compare
to the cases where the test should have been positive and negative based on the infectious period
occupant data (20 true positive, 0 false positive, 1 false negative and 11 true negatives) we
determine a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. If all the cases of persistent shedding
are considered true positives (n=30) then sensitivity increases to 96.9% with 100% specificity by
including the additional weeks 4-7. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is
considered a false positive then (n=10) and the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity
would be 52%. This highlights the inability of this method to distinguish new contagious
infections from persistent viral shedding.
The timing of the transition from positive to negative coincides with the changeover of building
occupants, which started midweek during Week 7. There was a lack of clarity at the individual
level around movement and thus week 8 was excluded from analysis from both complex A and B.
All students were tested immediately upon arrival and instructed not to return to campus if
symptomatic. This presumption is consistent with negative wastewater results during Week 8.
With our current method there was no obvious mathematical correlation between documented
Covid-19 prevalence and Ct value of the wastewater results. There was very weak negative
correlation (R = -0.2) between Ct values and known hospital case counts by date, for both N1 and
9

N2. This correlation did not hold when either or both set of WWTP samples was also considered.
Ct values for the N1 and N2 amplicons were highly correlated with each other (r ~0.94) across
each kind of wastewater sample (hospital, raw influent, and primary solids) and for all samples
combined.
The small number of positive cases occurring in the sampled dorms during this study precludes
rigorous statistical comparison between measured Ct values and corresponding case counts by
date. However, it is notable that no new cases were recorded in Complex A after Week 2.
Therefore, the positive results obtained during Weeks 3-7 are attributed to persistent viral shedding
from a relatively small number of convalescent occupants (3 out of 105). There was no apparent
trend in Ct values over time since discovery of the last new case. That is, there was no indication
that Ct values gradually increased starting in Week 3 to 7 as known cases convalesced.
Discussion
Collecting representative wastewater samples
In summary, we demonstrated an accessible method for performing wastewater surveillance on
congregate settings with external validation of the results based on occupant testing. Although
this is a small data set there are several lessons which are important to note for both the method
and the interpretation. First, it was of interest to know how population size affects SARS-CoV-2
detectability in occupied residential buildings. Practically, UVA Hospital and most UVA dorms
offer multiple sampling locations, such that it was possible to monitor different population sizes
within the same building. We had an instance where a positive case was missed among a 15 person
occupancy. This may have been because of inadequate sample collection due to low water use by
less than 20 occupants or simply because of the positive case had a bowel movement which was
missed. However, we took this to indicate that our current method is best targeted at building
occupancy of 20 or more persons. However, it is likely possible to sample much larger
populations. Recently published studies of community-level wastewater-monitoring for SARSCoV-2 have estimated that the sensitivity of this approach may be as low as 1 positive case per
10,000 19.
From a practical standpoint, dye testing was an important means of confirming that wastewater
from a particular building or wing flows to a candidate testing site. This also confirmed the very
short residence/travel times for individual toilet flushes. Ultimately we had started with grab
sample collection at a single time point (data not shown) but due to the widely varying daily
schedules of building occupants, coupled with the short resident time of outflow composite
sampling seemed more appropriate for the purpose intercepting all potential viral RNA shedding.
However, composite versus grab sample was not directly compared in this study. Twenty-four
hour collection (but often closer to 22-23 h in practice) yielded good positivity when known Covid19 cases were present among building occupants. However, shorter compositing durations may be
feasible, depending on contextual factors (i.e., occupant daily schedules, catchment flow rate and
travel time to the sampled location, etc.). One 11-h composite sample was collected from the
hospital cleanout valve and results were not noticeably different from samples collected using the
longer durations from the same site.

Sample handling after collection will likely also be an important factor. In a complex sample such
as wastewater, mitigating viral RNA degradation over time is critical to maximizing method
sensitivity and SARS-CoV-2 detectability23, 25. This study reports on collected during the summer,
when daytime temperatures were routinely as high as 38 °C (101 °F), using “portable”
autosamplers which do not come with wall outlet power adaptors. Because it was not possible to
refrigerate the autosamplers while they were in use, sample jars were packed on ice during sample
collection and transport to lab. This approach seems to have been adequate. However, there are
now several firms offering fee-based SARS-CoV-2 analysis for clients who ship their wastewater
samples to centralized testing facilities. Limited examination of RNA detectability over time
(same-day processing versus 1-d later) suggests that long travel times could reduce viral RNA
detectability, which could decrease the usefulness of wastewater-based surveillance as an early
warning system for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate living settings 40.
Comparing and optimizing molecular diagnostic techniques
This study initially focused on sampling from a Covid-19 tower at the UVA hospital and a local
municipal WWTP because it was expected that these locations would yield samples with
detectable quantities of SARS-CoV-2. This was critical for comparing and refining molecular
methods from literature before sampling from occupied buildings.
Effective RNA concentration is critical to the overall success of the proposed approach 39, 41.
Ultracentrifugation was roughly as effective as the electropositive filter method in this study 27,
which was somewhat unexpected based on existing literature 41. However, this could be because
electropositive filtration targets negatively charged viral particles, whereas this approach makes
use of RNA fragments rather than intact virus. 32, 42. Because the performance of these two
methods was not dramatically different, the decision to move forward with ultra-centrifugation
came down to practical consideration of its benefits and drawbacks. Regarding benefits: the
method is highly sensitive, consumes very small sample volumes, and does not require specialized
reagents or costly consumables that may be intermittently difficult to procure during the pandemic.
A critical drawback is that ultra-centrifuges are very costly. Also, because centrifugation is a batch
process (i.e., only a fixed number of samples can be spun at the same time), and long spin-up and
spin-down times are required to achieve the high g-forces needed to settle viral particles, this
approach is only moderately scalable. As a result, individual labs may struggle to process the large
numbers of samples arising from testing multiple buildings multiple times per week. As we have
little head-to-head data the major drawbacks to the elecropositive filtration methods were practical;
the supply chain issues on obtaining the filters as well as cost, personnel time biohazard risk and
logistics of filtering 6 L of wastewater. The other methods of RNA concentration with filtration
and precipitation were not as effective and thus not further pursued however, it should be noted
that the components of these protocols and methods which could have been refined for improved
recovery were not further explored and that the RNA extraction method seemed very impactful
and could have explained some of the differences 19, 28.

Effective RNA extraction is also a critical step in managing a complex specimen such as
wastewater given how many potential PCR inhibitors are present in wastewater 23, 28, 42. We
however, only thoroughly compared two commercial kits. It was observed that NucleoSpin
worked better than QiaAmp for the samples collected in this study with less inhibition but it should
be noted that there were still inhibited samples. In addition, without a quantified extraction control
it is not possible to evaluate the degree of partial inhibition from any given sample 43. Finally,
although the results are not presented in detail, samples from this study were run on multiple
commercial PCR platforms, such as Abbott Allinity and m2000. However, it was observed that
samples routinely failed on commercial platforms with “built-in” extraction protocols. These
failures were attributed to inhibition caused by wastewater constituents 23. This observation
highlights the need for careful evaluation of RNA extraction protocols as key to ensuring
successful amplification and good overall method sensitivity.
Wastewater samples collected in this study were run together with clinical samples from UVA
hospital (and elsewhere), using the same PCR platform. This platform is based on the CDC
protocol for SARS-CoV-2 analysis, which was not originally intended for wastewater-based
testing34. However, it was convenient for UVA to process its clinical and wastewater samples
together, subject to the same quality control procedures, because testing equipment and trained
personnel were already in place. Clinical diagnostics require very high reliability and sensitivity,
which are also extremely valuable in the context of pooled wastewater-based surveillance for
congregate living facilities (e.g., to get ahead of an outbreak by finding a small number of positives
within the overall building population).
Validating and interpreting results
Ultimately this most important outcome of this study was in having a known group of
asymptomatic students in a congregate setting and symptomatic hospitalized patients and
demonstrate that the method was sensitive and aligned with the known carriage of the building
occupants Covid-19 infection status when there is enough wastewater flow. The method was also
reproducibly positive on a community with known cases, thereby validating a reasonable limit of
detection for a larger population.
The goal of this surveillance method would ultimately be paired with testing all individuals in a
building once a new contagious positive is detected. The method used in this study gives reliably
positive results even when the number of positive (or convalescent) cases in a sampled population
is very small. However, the downside of using this very sensitive molecular detection method was
that it could not distinguish new cases from persistent convalescent shedding. It is well
documented that persons shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA for weeks in their stool after infection 17, 44.
This is evident from the Ct measurements over time at Complex A, whereby viral shedding from
a very small number of asymptomatic cases was detectable for several weeks after the last new
case was identified. Results stayed positive (Ct < 45) for more than a month, with no discernable
indication that viral quantity was decreasing over time. We hypothesized that the Ct detection
would increase as post-infectious shedding resolved however with our non-quantitative method
we did not see an indication of this in the data. In addition, the observed Ct values cannot be used
12

to impute what number of newly positive cases from convalescent shedding are present in a
particular building at any given time. It is anticipated that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA stool shedding
would decrease overtime and thus be reflected in higher Ct values with no new cases16, 17. Possible
strategies for overcoming this challenge may include refinement of the molecular method to make
them more robustly quantitative or application of statistical modeling approaches, once there is
better data to parameterize fecal viral shedding over time for symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases.
In conclusion, results from this pilot study confirm that we have developed a feasible method for
wastewater-based testing at individual building level as a means of implementing passive pooled
SARS-CoV-2 surveillance for occupied congregate living settings. Because we are attempting to
use this as a method of pooled surveillance on congregate settings we wanted sensitivity over
accurate quantification. The molecular methods used in this study, based on literature and existing
clinical methodology, are highly sensitive but not specific for new infections. Persistent
convalescent shedding will likely be an important technical challenge that must be overcome in
future work so that the proposed approach can be successfully deployed in congregate living
settings such as skilled nursing homes, university dormitories and prisons.
