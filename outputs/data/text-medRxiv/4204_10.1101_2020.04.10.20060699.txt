Abstract
Background
Treatments are urgently needed to prevent respiratory failure and deaths from coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received worldwide attention
because of positive results from small studies.

Methods
We used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen ≥ 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at
assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was
transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any
cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment
weighting.

Results
This study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within
48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well
balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group
were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21
events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47–1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients
died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13–2.89),
and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7
days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65–2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%)
experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation.

Interpretation
These results do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for documented SARSCoV-2-positive hypoxic pneumonia.

Introduction
The WHO-declared pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is causing fatal pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Treatments are urgently needed to prevent hypoxemic respiratory failure and death.1 Because
an in vitro study documented potential activity by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on SARSCoV-22 and small studies have released controversial results, HCQ has received intense
worldwide attention. Its effectiveness for COVID-19 is highly contentious.3 One uncontrolled
French study of 26 hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab
suggested that HCQ, at a dose of 600 mg/day, decreased SARS-CoV-2 shedding and that the
combination with azithromycin had further efficacy.4 However, another uncontrolled French
study found no evidence of antiviral clearance with HCQ and azithromycin in 11 hospitalised
patients.5 From a clinical perspective, a recent study randomised 62 patients in two parallel
groups, one control group and one receiving HCQ treatment (400 mg/d for 5 days), and found
a reduction of time to clinical recovery.6 These patients, however, were not severely ill, the
clinical endpoints were not clearly defined, and there was no stratification for comorbidities
associated with a poor outcome.6
Based on these results, the negligible cost and known safety profile of HCQ, this drug
has been considered to be potentially useful in patients with SARS-CoV-2, has attracted
enormous attention in social and mass media and has received FDA approval for severe
cases.7 On the other hand, fears of a shortage of this essential treatment for patients with
rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) have recently increased, and
questions about its safety in patients with COVID-19 have been raised.3
Due to the lack of unbiased data and the urgency of confirming, if possible, the
clinical efficacy of HCQ in this situation, we designed an emulated trial using observational
data collected in a real-world setting in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection
requiring oxygen. The primary aim was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of oral HCQ at a
daily dose of 600 mg in preventing admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death by
any cause; secondary aims were to assess its effectiveness in preventing acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods
Study Design
We used data collected from routine care to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing
the effectiveness of HCQ for patients hospitalised with a COVID-19 infection and requiring
oxygen.8

Study population
To assess patient eligibility, physicians screened the electronic health records of all
patients hospitalised between March 17 and 31, 2020, in four French tertiary care centres
providing care to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Adult patients were eligible in this
study if they were aged between 18 years and 80 years, had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection, and required oxygen by mask or nasal prongs (corresponding to a WHO
progression score of 5).
Exclusion criteria were 1) the presence of a contraindication to HCQ at 600 mg daily
(including patients under dialysis); 2) the start of HCQ before admission to the hospital; 3)
treatment with another experimental drug for COVID-19 (tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, or
remdesivir) within 48 hours after admission; 4) organ failure requiring immediate admission
to the ICU or continuous care unit (CCU); 5) ARDS at admission (defined by the need for
non-invasive ventilation with provision of positive airway pressure or invasive mechanical
ventilation);9 6) discharge from the ICU to standard care; 7) decision to limit and stop active
therapeutics made at admission); and 8) opposition to data collection by the patient or her/his
legal representative.
The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, as amended,
and received approval by the appropriate IRB (number 2020_060, Paris XII University, APHP).

Treatment strategies
We compared two treatment strategies: initiation of HCQ at a daily dose of 600 mg in
the first 48 hours after hospitalisation (HCQ group) and the absence of HCQ initiation during
this two-day period (no-HCQ or control group).

Start and end of follow-up
To avoid time-dependent bias, the start of follow-up (baseline or time zero) for each
individual was the time of his or her hospital admission. The end of follow-up was death,
discharge home, or day 7 (D7) after hospitalisation.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite: transfer to the ICU within 7 days of inclusion
and/or death from any cause. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at day 7 and the
occurrence of ARDS. For patients transferred to another hospital, physicians were contacted
to obtain outcome data; if this was unsuccessful, these outcome data were considered missing.
Before HCQ initiation and 3 to 5 days afterwards, all patients receiving HCQ had QT
prolongation assessed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and corrected for heart rate by
Bazett’s or Fredericia’s formula.

Statistical analysis
An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach was used to
“emulate” randomisation and balance the differences in baseline variables between treatment
groups.10,11 A non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to
estimate each patient’s probability of receiving HCQ given their baseline covariates (i.e., the
propensity score). Variables of the propensity score (PS) model were planned and
prespecified before outcome analyses and included 1) age; 2) gender; 3) comorbidities
(presence of chronic respiratory insufficiency under oxygen therapy or asthma or cystic
fibrosis or any chronic respiratory pathology likely to decompensate during a viral infection;
heart failure (NYHA III or IV); chronic kidney disease; liver cirrhosis with a Child-Pugh
stage B or more; personal history of cardiovascular disease [hypertension, stroke, coronary
artery disease, cardiac surgery]; insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or diabetic
microangiopathy or macroangiopathy; treatment by immunosuppressive drugs, including
anticancer chemotherapy; uncontrolled HIV infection or HIV infection with CD4 cell counts
< 200/µl; or a haematological malignancy); 4) BMI (≥30 kg/m2 or not); 5) third trimester of
pregnancy; 6) treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs);12 7) time since symptom onset; and 8) severity of condition at

admission (percentage of lung affected [≥50% or not]; presence of confusion; respiratory
frequency; oxygen saturation without oxygen; oxygen flow; systolic blood pressure; and Creactive protein (CRP) (≥40 mg/L or not)). Non-linear effects of continuous variables were
considered in the model by using fractional polynomials. Standardised differences were
examined to assess balance, with a threshold of 10% designated to indicate clinically
meaningful imbalance.13 Outcomes were analysed based on the IPTW estimate of the relative
risk (RR), with its 95% confidence interval (CI) derived from the variance estimator
accounting for the estimated propensity score.14 We also examined outcomes in the subgroup
of patients with a better prognosis at admission, estimated by a qSOFA < 2.14,15
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of findings. First,
we analysed the unweighted sample. Second, we performed a trimmed analysis that was
truncated at 5% of the extreme weights. Finally, we compared our results with an analysis that
excluded patients who received HCQ later during their follow-up (i.e., more than 48 h after
admission).
We had no missing data for either transfer to ICU or death, and only two cases missing
data about ARDS. We chose not impute missing data. All statistical analyses were performed
with the R statistical package version 3.6.1 or later (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, https://www.R-project.org/).

Results
Patients
Among the 181 patients eligible for analysis, 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of
admission and 97 did not (although 8 of them did receive HCQ later on). The median age of
patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR], 52 to 68 years), and 71.1% were men. All
comorbidities were less frequent in the HCQ group. The median delay between symptom
onset and admission to hospital was 7 days (IQR, 5 to 10 days). Overall, initial severity was
well balanced between the groups, except for confusion at admission (0 in the HCQ group vs
6 [6.2%] in the no-HCQ group) (Table 1). Further, of patients in the HCQ group, 17 (20%)
received concomitant azithromycin, and 64 (76%) received concomitant amoxicillin and
clavulanic acid.

Propensity score model development
Propensity scores ranged from 0.11 to 0.90 and from 0.04 to 0.82 in the HCQ and noHCQ groups, respectively, with 96.1% in the region of common support (Supplementary
data 1). After applying IPTW, 15 of the 19 covariates in the planned propensity score had
weighted standardised differences below 10% while 4 (confusion at admission, chronic
kidney disease, heart failure [NYHA III or IV] and liver cirrhosis [Child-Pugh B or more])
exceeded the threshold (Supplementary data 2). These results were due to the absence of
confusion at admission in the HCQ group (vs 6 patients with confusion in the no-HCQ
group); only one patient had chronic kidney disease in the HCQ group (vs 8 in the control
group); only one had heart failure (NYHA III or IV) (vs 5 patients in the no-HCQ group), and
again only one had liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or more) in the HCQ group (vs 0 in the noHCQ group). These 4 variables were therefore not included in the final propensity score
model (Supplementary data 3).

Outcomes
In the IPTW analysis, 20.5% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died
within 7 days, compared with 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, RR 0.93, 95% CI
0.48–1.81) (Table 2). Sensitivity analyses provided consistent results with RR 0.88, 95% CI
0.49–1.57 in the unweighted sample; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45–1.77 in the trimmed analysis; and
RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.47–1.93) when patients who received HCQ during their follow-up were
excluded (Supplementary data 4). For the secondary outcomes, 2.8% of patients in the HCQ
group died within 7 days, compared with 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61,
95% CI 0.13–2.90). Similarly, 27.7% of the HCQ group and 24.1% of the no-HCQ group
developed ARDS within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.66–2.01]) (Table 2).
Results were similar in the subgroup of patients with better prognosis at admission (qSOFA
<2) with RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54−2.32 for the primary outcome, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.15−7.76
for overall mortality, and RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.71−2.44 for ARDS.

Safety
Among the 84 patients receiving HCQ within the first 48 hours, 8 (9.5%) experienced
ECG modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation at a median of 4 days (3-9) after it began,
according to French national guidelines. Among them, 7 had a corrected QT interval (QTc)
prolongation of more than 60 ms (including 1 with QTc > 500 ms). One patient who received

no other medication that might interfere with cardiac conduction presented a first-degree
atrioventricular block after 2 days of HCQ treatment. Of note, a patient in whom HCQ was
initiated 5 days after admission (no-HCQ group) was transferred to the ICU 2 days
afterwards, where he was prescribed lopinavir and ritonavir and developed left bundle branch
block on day 8.

Discussion
We report a comparative study that uses real-world data collected from routine care to
assess the efficacy and safety of HCQ in a population of 181 patients hospitalised for COVID19 hypoxemic pneumonia. We found that HCQ treatment at 600 mg/day added to standard of
care was not associated with a reduction of admissions to ICUs or death 7 days after hospital
admission, compared to standard of care alone. The rate of ARDS did not decrease either. Our
population of patients hospitalised because they required oxygen is very similar to that
reported by others, and the percentage of patients transferred to the ICU was similar to that
reported in a Chinese cohort of 138 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 pneumonia.16 The
clinical features of patients included were also consistent with other reports, with a
predominance of men and of patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and/or obesity.16,17
Almost all patients had bilateral pneumonia, and 75% moderate or severe lung infiltrate.18 The
patients in this study did not receive any other drug, in particular, potential confounders such
as anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatments, including steroids, before ICU admission.
The timing of antiviral treatment initiation may be critical in reducing SARS-Cov-2
viral load.19 Accordingly, in the recent lopinavir–ritonavir trial, a post-hoc subgroup analysis
suggested that lopinavir–ritonavir could have a clinical benefit if started earlier than 12 days
after the onset of symptoms.20 This was the case here, because (1) patients had a median time
from symptom onset to inclusion of 7 days, (2) they were treated with HCQ as soon as
possible (i.e. in the 48 hours after hospital admission), and (3) we found that viral RNA for
SARS-CoV-2 was detectable for all patients at inclusion, showing active viral shedding.
Previous reports21 indicate that HCQ should have been expected to show some antiviral
efficacy. We did not check subsequent SARS-Cov-2 PCR in this study and therefore cannot
reach a conclusion about its potential efficacy for decreasing viral shedding. Although this
may appear to be a limitation, we used robust clinical outcomes here, i.e., death and ICU
admission, which are substantially more clinically relevant.

COVID-19 pneumonia progression in the second week of illness is associated with a
so-called “cytokine storm”,17,22 which is thought to be responsible for the clinical worsening
of many patients. Most of the patients included in this study had an inflammatory syndrome
defined by C-reactive-protein higher than 40 mg/l, which suggests that a cytokine storm
syndrome had already begun.23 Drugs decreasing virus shedding may therefore be inadequate
at this stage; this is why many anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being tested, such as
tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and others. Despite the immunomodulatory properties of HCQ,
which include regulation of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-1,
IL-6 and TNFα,24 and endosomal inhibition of toll-like receptors, which play a major role in
innate immune response,25 this treatment showed no effectiveness in this specific population.
Finally, HCQ blocks the KCNH2-encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel and can
potentially prolong the QTc, with potential severe consequences such as sudden cardiac death
and cardiac arrhythmia.26 Besides QTc prolongations, we observed 2 other significant
cardiologic events in this study, and the French national drug agency has reported 3 deaths
potentially related to HCQ since its promotion to the public as a potential treatment for
COVID-19. Although HCQ was considered safe in the context of SLE, these adverse events
may be explained by the use of high-dose HCQ in elderly patients with renal impairment and
frequent drug interactions. Accordingly, the negative clinical results of this study argue
against the widespread use of HCQ in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Our study has several limitations. First, although our aim was to emulate a target trial
and we used robust statistical techniques for adjustment, treatment was not randomly assigned
and potential unmeasured confounders may bias our results. Second, four potentially
important prognostic variables could not be balanced in the PS model because none or only
one patient in the HCQ group presented with these variables. Accordingly, caution is required
in the interpretation of results, especially for overall mortality where only a limited number of
events were observed. Third, we did not take a centre effect into account in the PS model
because the number of patients treated with HCQ in centres was unbalanced (some centres
treated all patients with HCQ, while others did not).
In conclusion, we found that HCQ did not significantly reduce admission to ICU or
death at day 7 after hospital admission, or ARDS in hospitalised patients with hypoxemic
pneumonia due to COVID-19. These results are of major importance and do not support the
use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for a documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
