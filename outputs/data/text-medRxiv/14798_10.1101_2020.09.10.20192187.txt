Abstract
The COVID-19 global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) continues to place an immense burden on societies and healthcare systems. A
key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serologic testing to determine the community
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior
infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses
readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood
samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this test affords the
estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby
providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individual’s immune
response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test makes it an excellent
option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in 26.9 million cases
and over 881,000 deaths worldwide to date (1–3). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family
Coronaviridae, which includes six other agents known to be virulent in humans: the endemic
human coronaviruses hCoV-229E, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43 associated with
mild respiratory illness; and the zoonotic, highly virulent SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory
syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (4, 5). Infection by SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly associated
with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms (6, 7). However, like the SARS and MERS
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can also cause severe respiratory disease (5–7). Current COVID19 control efforts emphasize physical distancing, molecular testing for evidence of active
infection, and isolation of infected and/or symptomatic individuals and their close contacts.
Antibody testing to identify individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can complement these
efforts. At the community and population level, serological data can inform public health policy
by uncovering spatial and temporal patterns of viral transmission. At the individual level, such
testing is required to evaluate the kinetics and efficacy of the immune response to infection
and vaccination. Thus, there is an urgent need for affordable and scalable antibody tests that
provide both qualitative and quantitative data, ideally from single sample measurements, and
that can be widely implemented.
SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the viral membrane-anchored spike
glycoprotein (S), which forms homotrimers decorating the viral surface (8, 9). Viral entry into
human cells requires interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with
its host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in a variety
of tissues, including the lung, small intestine, kidney, heart, and testes (10–12). The spike

protein is also a major target of the humoral immune response, and spike-specific antibodies
that block viral entry into cells (neutralization) can afford protection against severe disease (13,
14). A number of studies have shown that convalescent patient sera contain high levels of
SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies with significant virus-neutralizing
activity (15–18). In addition the spike protein’s sequence divergence from those of the widely
circulating endemic hCoVs (<30% sequence similarity of the S gene at the amino acid level
(19)) make it an ideal antigen to detect and measure SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.
Here we describe a highly sensitive and specific ELISA-based test for SARS-CoV-2
exposure that was developed and clinically translated at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic
in New York City in March–April 2020. The test employs a purified, recombinant SARS-CoV-2
spike protein ectodomain and readily available, research-grade laboratory reagents to detect
spike-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in human sera or plasma. We show that the IgG test
affords not only for the qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with high sensitivity
and specificity, but also the accurate determination of spike-specific IgG titers from a single
sample measurement.

Results
Development of an ELISA to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and IgA in COVID-19
convalescent sera
Available serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 have used antigens derived from the spike and/or
nucleocapsid proteins, the predominant targets of the humoral response to natural infection (8,
17, 18, 20, 21). Further, many spike-specific assays have employed truncated forms of the
spike (e.g., the S1 subunit or the RBD) as the target antigen (17, 22, 23), in part because the
full-length spike can be challenging to produce at scale. Here, we focused on the full-length
spike ectodomain as our assay antigen so as to sample antibodies that recognize all parts of
the spike protein (20). Accordingly, we produced a recently described recombinant spike
ectodomain protein bearing stabilizing mutations (9). Optimized expression and purification
protocols resulted in yields of 20–35 mg/L of homogenous, structurally well-defined spike
trimers from transiently transfected ExpiCHO-STM cell cultures (24).
We examined the capacity of this trimeric spike protein to specifically capture
antibodies in convalescent sera from healthy individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Spike protein-coated ELISA plates were incubated with serial dilutions of serum, and bound
antibodies were detected and measured with a human IgG-specific secondary antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Varying levels of spike-specific IgG were
detected in convalescent sera but not in a pre-COVID control serum (Fig 1a).
Although most efforts to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune response have
focused on IgG, multiple reports suggest that IgA may also provide a sensitive marker for
SARS-CoV-2 exposure (15, 19, 25). Accordingly, we used the assay format described above,
but with a human IgA-specific secondary conjugate, to detect and quantify spike-specific IgA
in the same serum samples. IgA was consistently detected in these samples and was present
at levels concordant with those of IgG (Fig 1b).

Definition of optimal single dilutions and corresponding diagnostic thresholds for the Sspecific IgG and IgA ELISAs
To develop the assay into a clinical laboratory test, we sought to identify a serum dilution
which could provide a single threshold for reliably detecting spike-specific antibodies.
Accordingly, we examined three sample dilutions each for IgG and IgA in an ELISA (Fig 1c, d),
which were selected from full response curves (Fig 1a, b). Using this simplified three-dilution
ELISA, we analyzed a large panel of sera from COVID-19 convalescent donors (Conv;
presumptively seropositive) and archival pre-COVID sera (Ctrl; presumptively seronegative)
(Table 1) for both IgG (Fig 2a, b) and IgA (Fig 2d, e).
Donors in the Conv cohort (n=197) were initially selected to identify potential COVID-19
convalescent plasma donors according to New York Blood Center donor guidelines at the time
of screening. Specifically, they had confirmed prior infection (positive RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2 RNA) and had been asymptomatic for at least 14 days at the time of sampling (median 28
days post symptoms and 24 days post diagnosis). The Ctrl cohort was a set of patient serum
samples collected at Montefiore Medical Center between 2008–2019 (Ctrl-Pre-2020; n=171)
and in Jan 2020 (Ctrl-Jan 2020; n=45), prior to identification of the first COVID-19 cases in the
greater New York City area in late February 2020 (26) (Table 1).
To assess assay reproducibility, the Ctrl and Conv samples were analyzed in two
independent experiments conducted by different researchers. The average absorbances (A450)
from the independent experiments were found to be highly correlated for both IgG (Fig 2c) and
IgA (Fig 2f).
The results from the presumptive seropositive and seronegative cohorts were analyzed
using receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves to determine assay sensitivity and
specificity at each candidate threshold value (Fig 3a and Table 2). For both IgG and IgA, the
area under the curve (AUC) was found to be essentially equivalent at the lower two serum

dilutions but greater than that at the highest serum dilution. To conserve clinical samples for
additional laboratory tests, we selected the intermediate dilution (1/1,000 for IgG and 1/200 for
IgA) for further analysis.
To identify the diagnostic threshold that maximized assay sensitivity and specificity at
this dilution while minimizing the number of clinically harmful false positives, we selected a
point on each ROC curve corresponding to a specificity of ~99%, thereby obtaining threshold
A450 values of 0.90 and 0.60, respectively, for IgG and IgA. These threshold values were at or
near the maximal point of the curve comparing the sum of sensitivity and specificity against
each candidate threshold, indicating near-optimal assay performance (Fig 3b, c). Reanalysis of
the datasets at these thresholds yielded sensitivities of 91% and 70% (Fig 3b, c), respectively,
and a specificity of ~99% for the IgG and IgA tests (Fig 2g, h, Tables 3–4).
Given the lower sensitivity of the IgA test relative to the IgG, we determined the
relationship between the test results for each patient in the Conv and Ctrl cohorts (Fig 2i).
Although IgG positivity correlated with that of IgA, especially for the strongly positive sera, a
considerable proportion (22%) of the IgG-positive Conv sera were negative for IgA. The
converse was not true—only 1% of Conv samples were positive for IgA but negative for IgG.
These findings are consistent with emerging evidence that serum IgA wanes more rapidly than
IgG in COVID-19 convalescent patients (27). We conclude that IgG provides a more sensitive
probe of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in convalescent patient sera than does IgA, at least when the
spike protein is used as the capture antigen.

Prior exposure to endemic human coronaviruses is not associated with false positives
The high seroprevalence of endemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs; >90% of adults over 50
years old) (28, 29) and the low positivity rates of the archival Ctrl specimens in the spike IgG
and IgA tests strongly suggested that both tests specifically detect the divergent SARS-CoV-2

spike protein. To further address SARS-CoV-2 assay specificity, we tested 22 pre-COVID-19pandemic serum samples from individuals who had RT-qPCR-confirmed infection with human
alphacoronaviruses (229E, NL63) or betacoronaviruses (OC43, HKU1) for anti-S IgG and IgA by
ELISA (Fig 4). In agreement with the molecular test results, we observed that most of these
samples contained reactive IgG and/or IgA against the recombinant spike proteins of the
hCoVs 229E and HKU1 but not the emerging betacoronavirus, MERS. However, none were
positive in our IgG and IgA tests. Thus, both tests are highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 and
unlikely to engender false positives due to prior patient exposure to circulating hCoVs.

Test performance in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients
We next assessed the capacity of the IgG and IgA tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in a
hospitalized COVID-19 cohort. The spike-specific IgG and IgA reactivities of blood drawn from
each patient immediately (days 0–1; early samples) after hospital admission or after 6–10 days
(late samples) were determined. Most of the early samples were negative for both IgG and IgA;
in contrast, most of the late samples were positive for both (Fig 5a, c), indicating that most of
the patients (but not all) developed a detectable antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 over the
first 6–10 days of their hospitalization. Because the interval between symptom onset and date
of hospitalization varied, we replotted the above data to observe the development of the spikespecific antibody response post-symptom onset. Both IgG and IgA were readily detectable by
day eight and a majority of the patients were IgG and/or IgA-positive by day 14 post-symptom
onset (Fig 5b, d).

Cross-validation with New York State Department of Health SARS-CoV-2 antibody test

Health (NYSDOH) developed a microsphere-based test for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific

antibodies that has been extensively employed to date (30, 31). To cross-validate our IgG
antibody test, we provided WC with ten Conv samples and two Ctrl samples for analysis in
their assay. WC was blinded to all samples. Despite the considerable differences in the
platforms and diagnostic thresholds employed by the WC and Einstein spike-based IgG tests,
there was complete agreement between them (Fig 6a).

Clinical translation
All of the above results presented were generated by manual experimentation in research
laboratories at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. To leverage our IgG assay for highthroughput clinical testing, we translated it to a robotic platform in a CLIA-certified laboratory
at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC). A larger subset of Ctrl and Conv samples (102 in total)
were tested on the MMC platform. The MMC laboratory was blinded to the identities of all
samples. A high level of agreement (96%) between the platforms was observed, with three of
four discordant results occurring in samples with values at or near the diagnostic threshold
(i.e., borderline samples) (Fig 6b). This clinically translated test formed the basis of an NYSDOH
application for a laboratory developed test (LDT) by MMC.

IgG test affords quantitation of anti-spike antibodies from a single measurement
Having established and clinically translated the IgG ELISA for use as a diagnostic test, we
investigated if it could also be used to determine the magnitude of the spike-specific antibody
response in patient samples. We first generated serum titration curves (e.g., Fig 1) to determine
spike IgG endpoint titers for the entire Conv cohort (n= 197). Next, we compared these titers to
the independently measured A450 values for the same samples at 1/1,000 dilution (Fig 2a) and
observed a nonlinear relationship (Fig 7a). Accordingly, we modeled this relationship through a
nonlinear regression analysis by fitting a sigmoidal function using the least-squares method.

Our model fit the experimental data well (Fig 7a; R2 = 0.88), suggesting that it could be used to
infer spike-specific IgG titers from the single measurement performed for the diagnostic test.
We further employed a ten-fold cross-validation method to evaluate the predictive utility of the
model (see Materials and Methods for details). Our model could accurately predict the
experimental IgG titer of a convalescent serum sample based solely on a single A450
measurement (R2 = 0.81 ± 0.02) (Fig 7b).

Discussion
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there remains a need for non-proprietary and scalable
diagnostic antibody tests for monitoring populations that are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and to
gauge exposure at a population-wide level. High-throughput assays for quantitative serology
are also urgently needed to support the development and global deployment of COVID-19
vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapeutics. Here, we describe, validate, and
clinically translate a simple, high-performance ELISA-based test for SARS-CoV-2 spikespecific IgG, developed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in March–
April 2020. We also explore the utility of a highly specific IgA-based test for SARS-CoV-2
exposure. Finally, we demonstrate that our test can accurately quantitate SARS-CoV-2 spikespecific IgG in clinical samples from a single measurement.
The spike protein is a major target of the human antibody response to natural
coronavirus infection and has key advantages as a capture antigen in serologic assays. First,
anti-spike, but not anti-nucleocapsid antibody titers in convalescent sera correlate with
neutralizing activity (17, 18, 32),decreased disease and viral load in animal models (13, 14, 33–
37) and survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection (13, 14). Second, the spike gene has the most
divergent protein-coding sequence among the coronaviruses. The spike protein is thus the
least likely to engender false positives due to antibodies arising from endemic hCoV exposure
(Grifoni et al. 2020; Okba et al. 2020). Despite these potential advantages, the nucleocapsid
protein has long been favored over spike in coronavirus serologic assays, in part because it
can be readily expressed at high levels without compromising conformation or immunogenicity
(38). By contrast, pre-fusion trimers of the larger, more complex, and heavily glycosylated spike
protein are more challenging to produce at scale (39). A number of spike-specific antibody
tests have relied on individual spike subunits (typically, the highly immunogenic N–terminal
subunit S1) (22, 40) or on truncated protein fragments (typically, the receptor-binding domain

[RBD]) (17). We optimized the production and purification of a stabilized, full-length spike
ectodomain described by Wrapp and colleagues (9) and showed that these scaled-up
preparations largely consisted of homogenous pre-fusion trimers (24). We leveraged these
large, biochemically well-defined preparations to develop a scalable serologic assay for SARSCoV-2 that could comprehensively sample the antibody response to its spike protein.
We initially sought to establish a qualitative antibody test based on a standard ELISA
format. We showed that analysis at three serum dilutions could corroborate the results of full
antibody titration curves for IgG and IgA (Fig 1). Further analysis of large convalescent, preCOVID control, and hCoV-exposed control cohorts at these three serum dilutions allowed us to
identify optimal single dilutions and diagnostic thresholds for both tests. At the selected
thresholds, the IgG test was 91% sensitive and 99% specific for SARS-CoV-2, comparable to
other highly sensitive spike-based assays (23, 41). The ROC analyses showed that further
increases in sensitivity came at an unacceptable expense of specificity. Although the failure of
the IgG test to detect spike-specific antibodies above threshold in ~10% of COVID-19
convalescents (at an average of 28 days post-symptom onset) may arise in part from technical
limitations, it likely also reflects meaningful biological heterogeneity in the antibody response to
natural infection (17, 42, 43). Our positive Conv cohort was composed solely of individuals
characterized as having mild disease, with none requiring oxygen support. Recent work has
shown that such individuals are more likely to seroconvert slowly and to have a lower overall
antibody response (15, 19, 44–46).
The IgA test was considerably less sensitive (~70%) than the IgG at a threshold
selected to provide 99% specificity (Fig 3a, c) in contrast to early reports of anti-S IgA assay
that had higher sensitivity, but lower specificity than IgG (15, 19, 22, 25, 47). This is unlikely to
be due to the delayed development of an IgA response relative to IgG, as the kinetics of IgA
seroconversion has been shown to resemble, or even slightly precede that of IgG (15, 25).

Rather, it may reflect the more rapid waning of serum IgA in convalescents (27). Concordantly,
the IgA test appeared to detect a SARS-CoV-2 response in a higher percentage of samples
from our small cohort of hospitalized patients (Fig 5). We also examined the possibility that,
despite its lower sensitivity, the IgA test could be used to identify positives missed by the IgG
test. We found that only 1% of the Conv cohort was positive for IgA alone, which was similar to
the false-positive rate (Fig 2i, Table 4). We conclude that there is no added value to combining
the IgG and IgA tests or using the latter for reflex testing to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
Spike-specific IgA may nevertheless be of use as a biomarker to help assess disease severity
in acutely infected patients (15, 25).
The performance characteristics of the IgG test were used to assess its clinical utility at
different levels of population seroprevalence (Table 5). Seroprevalence in New York City was
~20% at the end of April, (31, 48). Further, data from the New York City Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene show that the seropositive rate in Bronx County to be 32.5% based on
testing of over 17% of the county’s population (49). Seroprevalence at MMC, obtained during
patient intake from April 4 through August 27, 2020, was 25.1% of 26,397 tests, using the
Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (obtained using the SlicerDicer function of MMC’s Epic
Electronic Medical Record; E. Cadoff, personal communication). Under these conditions, the
IgG test described herein has high positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV,
respectively, of 97%). Accordingly, we translated it to a high-throughput, semi-automated
platform in a CLIA-certified laboratory at MMC. A high degree of concordance was observed
between the manual and automated tests and between the manual test and a microsphere
immunoassay test developed by NYSDOH’s Wadsworth Laboratory. More comprehensive
cross-validation efforts comparing the Einstein/MMC IgG test with several FDA-authorized
commercial antibody tests and other tests currently in development are being conducted at

MMC (Wolgast, L. et. al., manuscript in preparation). These findings strongly support the
clinical deployment of our IgG test.
Finally, we used independent experimental datasets from >200 convalescent sera to
generate a logistic regression model for the accurate estimation of IgG titers from single
absorbance values obtained with the IgG test. These findings expand the research and
diagnostic utility of the Einstein/MMC IgG test without sacrificing its simplicity and throughput.
Specifically, we believe that our test will help meet the need for quantitative serology
engendered by the development and deployment of spike-based vaccines and convalescent
plasma transfusion therapy for COVID-19 (23). Indeed, given the significant percentage of
COVID-19 convalescents with low or negative serologic reactivity in this study, the rapid but
accurate measurement of antibody levels in plasma will be crucial to vetting plasma collected
from convalescent donors (50, 51). Further, the rapid measurement of serum IgG and/or IgA in
a point-of-care setting may find utility in clinical decision-making, including patient selection for
the administration of medications such as steroids or convalescent plasma (52, 53) to treat
COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Patient Cohorts
Protocol approvals for patient sample acquisition were obtained by the Institutional Review
Boards (IRB) of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Conv, Hosp, Ctrl cohorts, US samples
in hCoV cohort) or Umeå University Hospital (Swedish samples in hCoV cohort).
Control (Ctrl) Cohorts: Patient sera samples collected prior to identification of the first case of
COVID-19 in the United States.
Ctrl-2020: 45 de-identified remnant sera from unique patients collected in January 2020.
Ctrl-Pre2020: 171 de-identified remnant sera from unique patients, collected between October
1 and January 1 in 2008 to 2019 and stored in the Einstein Biorepository. These months were
selected to enrich for samples from patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illnesses.
Samples were collected for a variety of studies, but those from studies that enrolled HIVinfected patients were excluded.
Human coronavirus (hCoV): Remnant sera from patients with confirmed positive RT-qPCR
tests for HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-HKU1. Five sera were collected in
January and early February 2020 and were identified from remnant sera in the MMC Pathology
Laboratory. Another seventeen were from samples collected from patients in Umeå, Sweden in
2019-2020. All patient samples collected in 2020 were confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 by
RT-qPCR.
Hospitalized (Hosp): De-identified remnant sera from MMC inpatients who tested positive for
COVID-19 by the SARS-CoV-2 swab molecular test. A total of 27 patients with sera samples
collected at initial presentation in the Emergency Department or on days 0–1(early) and 7–10
days post admission (late) were selected for analysis. Clinical data indicating how long
symptoms were present before admission to the hospital was also available for most patients

and were used to redefine samples by days post-symptom onset (e.g. if a patient had a history
of 5 day of symptoms, the specimen was treated as day 5 in this series).
Convalescent (Conv: De-identified samples from 197 healthy adult volunteers in Westchester
County, NY who had previously recovered from COVID-19 were collected as indicated below.
All patients had confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection with documented positive RT-qPCR. All
patients were at least 14 days post resolution of symptoms (≥ 30 days post infection) at the
time of collection. These sera were initially collected to screen potential convalescent plasma
donors for a clinical trial on the efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19.

Sample collection and handling
Conv and Hosp cohort sera were obtained by venipuncture (BD Vacutainer, Serum),
centrifuged, aliquoted and stored at -80℃. Prior to analysis for anti-spike IgG and IgA
antibodies, samples were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56℃ and stored at 4℃. Samples
were handled under BSL-2 containment in accordance with a protocol approved by the
Einstein institutional biosafety committee. Historical serum samples (Ctrl-2020 and Pre2020
and hCoV cohorts) were previously stored at -80℃. Aliquots were thawed, heat inactivated as
above, and stored at 4℃ prior to analysis.

Protein Production and Purification
A pCAGGS plasmid encoding a mammalian codon-optimized, stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein with C-terminal Twin Strep and 8X His Tags (gift from Jason McLellan, described in
Wrapp et. al., 2020) was transiently transfected into ExpiCHO-STM cells (Gibco, Gaithersburg,
MD #A29127) (0.8 µg DNA per mL of ExpiCHO-STM culture) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 day, then at 32°C in a shaking incubator (125
RPM with 8% CO2) and fed according to the manufacturer's high titer protocol. Supernatant

was harvested on day 12 by centrifugation at 3700xg for 20min, adjusted to pH 8 and dialyzed
overnight at 4°C in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.0], 250 mM NaCl). Supernatant was
incubated with Ni-NTA resin for 2 hours at 4°C before resin was collected into a column and
washed with Tris buffer plus 20 mM Imidazole. Spike protein was eluted with Tris buffer plus
250 mM Imidazole. Eluant was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-15 100,000 NMWL Centrifugal
Filter unit (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA #UFC9010) and buffer exchanged by dialysis into
Tris buffer. Protein was aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80˚C. Protein
quality was confirmed by analytical size exclusion chromatography using a SuperoseTM 6
Increase 10/300 GL (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) before and after flash freezing.

Spike-specific IgG and IgA ELISA
Half-area ELISA plates (Corning #3690, Corning, NY) were incubated overnight at 4℃ with 25
µL per well of 2 μg/mL of purified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or S1 subunit from MERS (Sino
Biological, Chesterbrook, PA 40069-V08H), or HKU-1 (Sino Biological 40602-V08H), 229E (Sino
Biological 40601-V08H). Plates were washed three times with 120 µL per well 1x PBS-T (1x
PBS, pH 7.4 + 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) using a microplate washer (BioTek, Winooski, VT) before
being blocked for 1h at 25℃ with 150 μL per well of 1x PBS-T + 3% (v/v) milk (Bio-Rad #1706404). Serum was serially diluted in 96-well non-tissue culture treated round-bottom plates
(CELLTREAT, Pepperell, MA #22991) using 1x PBS-T + 1% (v/v) milk (1% milk PBS-T) as the
diluent. Blocked ELISA plates were washed three times with 120 μL per well of 1x PBS-T, then
25 µL of diluted serum was added to wells in duplicate. Plates were incubated for 2h at 25℃
before being washed three times with 120 μL per well of 1x PBS-T. Plates were incubated for
1h at 25℃ with 25 µl of secondary antibody (1:3,000 in 1% milk PBS-T): goat anti-human IgGHorseradish peroxidase (HRP) produced in goat (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA #31410) or antihuman IgA-HRP produced in goat (Millipore Sigma #A0295). Plates were washed as before,

prior to development with 25 μL per well of ultra-TMB ELISA substrate solution at room temp
(Thermo Scientific #34029). Plates were incubated in the dark for 5 min before quenching the
reaction with 25 µL per well of 0.5 M sulfuric acid (Millipore Sigma #339741). Absorbance at
450 nm (A450) was measured using a Cytation 5 plate reader (BioTek).

Clinical Pathology Lab ELISA
ELISA plates (Corning #3690) were coated with purified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
washed and blocked as described above. Aliquots from the samples used for development of
the research assay (see above) were diluted manually using 1% milk PBS-T as the diluent to
obtain the targeted single dilution for IgG (1:1000) or IgA (1:200). Each of these was added in
coated ELISA wells by the DSX automated ELISA system (Dynex Technologies; Chantilly VA)
using disposable pipette tips. Incubations, washings, and addition of the anti-human IgG and
IgA HRP conjugates, as well as the addition of substrate and stop solution was also
accomplished using the automated system. Wash buffer and all reagents were identical to
those used for the research assay described above. Reading was accomplished using a dual
wavelength mode with the same test wavelength (450 nm) as the research assay and a
reference wavelength of 620 nm.

Nonlinear regression analysis
We used nonlinear least-squares analysis to fit a sigmoidal function (Eq: 1) to the experimental
data (log10 IgG titer and A450 using a 1/1000 diluted serum; Fig 7):
𝑦 = 𝑦!"# + (𝑦!$% − 𝑦!"# ) / )1 + 10(('()!" *+#" - %

)∗0"'')

Where y corresponds to the absorbance; ymin and ymax are the minimum and maximum
absorbances respectively; EC50 is the IgG titer that gives half of maximum absorbance ymax ; Hill
describes the slope of the curve and; x is the log10 of the IgG titer.
To predict IgG titers for a given A450 value (measured using 1/1000 diluted serum) we
first inferred A450 using the fitted sigmoidal model, for 10,000 IgG titers evenly spaced between
the experimentally observed minimum and maximum IgG titers in our dataset. We then
identified the closest inferred A450 to the queried A450 value and interpolated the corresponding
IgG titer. We evaluated our nonlinear model by 10-fold cross-validation, where the original
dataset is randomly partitioned into 10 equal size subsets, and one of the subsets serves as
the testing set while the remaining nine subsets are used for training the non-linear model. This
process is repeated 10 times, using subsets for testing and training each time to ensure that all
data points in our dataset have been used once for testing. We iteratively (1,000 iterations)
evaluated our nonlinear model by 10-fold cross-validation, computing the R2 value between the
observed and predicted IgG titers at each iteration. Non-linear regression was performed using
the scipy library (54).

Figure Legends

Fig 1: ELISA to detect and measure SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and IgA in COVID-19
convalescent sera. Serially diluted convalescent patient sera (colored circles) and a pre-2020
negative control (gray diamonds) were added to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteincoated ELISA plates. Captured IgG (a) and IgA (b) were detected using Ig class-specific
secondary antibody-HRP conjugates. Absorbance (A450) values were fitted to a sigmoidal
curve. Samples were re-analyzed at three dilutions that best characterized the extent of the
antibody reactivity for IgG (c) and IgA (d). Averages +/- SD are shown, n=4 from two
independent experiments. SD values smaller than the height of the symbols are not shown.

Fig 2: Analysis of spike-specific IgG and IgA reactivity in convalescent and control
cohorts. Spike-specific IgG (a–b) and IgA (d–e) responses at the indicated serum dilutions
were determined for convalescent (Conv, n=197) and control (Ctrl, n=216) cohorts. (c, f) Interassay reproducibility of independent IgG and IgA assays at serum dilutions of 1:1,000 and
1:200, respectively, was assessed by a linear regression analysis. (g–h) Spike-specific IgG and
IgA reactivity for Conv and Ctrl cohorts at the selected test dilution (1:1,000 and 1:200 serum
dilutions, respectively). Diagnostic thresholds for IgG and IgA tests are shown as dotted lines
(A450 values of 0.90 and 0.60, respectively). Ctrl cohort is separated into Pre-2020 (n=171) and
Jan 2020 groups (n=45). (i) IgG and IgA reactivities of each sample in the Conv (orange circles)
and Ctrl (green circles). Respective diagnostic thresholds are indicated as dotted lines.
Percentages reflect the proportion of Ctrl and Conv in each quadrant.

threshold was extracted from the ROCs for the IgG and IgA tests. Dotted lines indicate the
selected thresholds (A450 of 0.90 and 0.60 for IgG and IgA, respectively).

Fig 4: Specificity of IgG and IgA tests for SARS-CoV-2 vs. commonly circulating human
coronaviruses. Serum samples from two cohorts of COVID-19–negative patients with RTqPCR-confirmed exposure to one or more commonly circulating human coronavirus (hCoV)
were analyzed in the SARS-CoV-2 IgG (a) and IgA (b) tests (SARS-2) and for IgG and IgA
reactivity against recombinant spike proteins from the indicated alpha- and betacoronaviruses
by ELISA. Dotted lines indicate diagnostic thresholds for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests only.
Data from at least 2 independent experiments (n=4–8) are shown.

Fig 5: Longitudinal analysis of hospitalized patients at two early time points with the IgG
and IgA tests. Serum samples from patients at two time points following hospital admission
were analyzed for spike-specific IgG (a) and IgA (c). Individual patient samples (circles) and
cumulative positive results (blue bars) are graphed as a function of days post-symptom onset
(self-reported) for IgG (b) and IgA (d). Data from two independent experiments (n=4) are shown.

serum sample in the Conv cohort. Data were fit to a sigmoidal function through a nonlinear
regression analysis. (b) A ten-fold cross-validation method was used to evaluate the predictive
utility of this model. For each serum sample, the experimentally determined endpoint IgG titer
was compared to that predicted from a single measurement with the antibody test using linear
regression analysis. Shaded blue areas represent the 95% confidence intervals for the curve
fits.
