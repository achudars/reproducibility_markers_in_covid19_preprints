The spreading of infectious diseases including COVID-19 depends on
human interactions. In an environment where behavioral patterns and
physical contacts are constantly evolving according to new governmental regulations, measuring these interactions is a major challenge.
Mobility has emerged as an indicator for human activity and, implicitly,
for human interactions. Here we study the coupling between mobility
and COVID-19 dynamics and show that variations in global air traffic and local driving mobility can be used to stratify different disease
phases. For ten European countries, our study shows maximal correlation between driving mobility and disease dynamics with a time lag
of 14.6 ± 5.6 days. Our findings suggests that local mobility can serve
as a quantitative metric to forecast future reproduction numbers and
identify the stages of the pandemic when mobility and reproduction
become decorrelated.

Introduction
A barometer is an instrument that measures air pressure. Its main purpose is to forecast
short term changes in the weather. It is often imprecise as it relies on a number of
assumptions linking variations of air pressure to atmospheric conditions. Nonetheless,
overall, we accept it as an important tool in weather prediction that has saved countless
lives since its introduction for forecasting in the 19th century. In an evolving crisis like
the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is in a dire need of a barometer that would provide
us with reliable estimates of the disease dynamics when lockdown measures are either
enacted or removed.

The transmission of an infectious disease depends mostly on three key aspects: the
biology of the disease when individuals are in contact, social and human behavior that
dictate the way individuals interact, and the physics of such contacts (closed spaces,
close contact, crowded spaces) (1). We still do not know about the details of the
COVID-19 pathology, and in particular how different age or population groups either
transmit or are susceptible to the disease (2, 3). But, the disease pathogenicity and
transmissibility cannot be altered in the absence of a vaccine or preventive treatments.
On the behavioral side, there has been a dramatic change in everyday habits with
widespread adoption of new rules to prevent both close contact between individuals
and the exchange of contaminated bodily fluids. The remaining factors, frequency and
type of contact, depend on human activity. Work, school, and leisure inevitably increase
the number of contacts, and hence the risk of transmission that occurs in everyday
life (4). At the global level, human mobility, tracked by mobile phone use, has recently
emerged as a possible proxy for human activity. Studies of the effective reproduction
number R(t), the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected person,
against in-state human mobility data in China (5–7) and in the United States (8, 9) have
demonstrated that as long as the epidemic is ongoing, mobility and reproduction number
are indeed correlated (10). Interestingly, successful exit strategies reveal a decorrelation
between these mobility and reproduction which implies that an increase in activity does
not lead to an increase in infection.
When considered together, current mobility data and disease indicators follow the
typical pattern shown in Fig. 1(a) with four distinct phases: Phase I of exponential
growth during the initial outbreak of the disease; Phase II of outbreak control during
which global and local mobility are rapidly reduced; Phase III of reduced growth under
lockdown with reduced local and global mobility; and Phase IV of gradual exit during
which lockdown measures are successively released and mobility increases while the
number of new cases continues to decrease. The end of Phase IV marks the beginning
of the second wave with newly increasing case numbers. An important feature of
the outbreak dynamics is that a reduction in the number of new cases is delayed by
about two weeks compared to the reduction in mobility and that this feature appears
systematically in across countries. This is not particularly surprising as it is the primary
goal of lockdown measures. However, we will show that another key property of the
data is the high correlation between mobility data and the reproduction number after
lockdown. We can formally exploit this property to understand the effects of human
activity on the reproduction number.
Modeling has proven to be a key element to understand disease dynamics (11, 12)
and establish new public health policies (13). While most models rely on standard
population models such as the SEIR model, there are many refinements and variations
that take into account contact between different groups, susceptibility, the effect of air

confidence intervals for any prediction based on these models. Precise predictions
require more fine-grained models (15). These models consider multiple effects and
mirror the complexity of interaction in societies; they include many parameters, including
mobility and proximity data, that are difficult to track, especially since rapid changes in
behavior often render a-few-day-old studies and historic trends irrelevant.
A complementary approach is to consider coarse-grained models with fewer parameters. While these models cannot be used to make precise long-term predictions of
the number of infections or deaths on a given day, they are particularly valuable when
predicting global trends in a robust manner since they only rely on a few parameters
that are almost entirely determined by the data alone. Here we adopt this approach to
study the relation between mobility and disease dynamics. We use the well-established
Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered SEIR compartment model with a network
structure and evaluate the local disease dynamics at the level of a node, which represents an individual country. We incorporate the local driving mobility at the nodal level
and the global mobility at the network level through passenger air travel with diffusive
transport. To take full advantage of prior knowledge about the model parameters and
the available data of each country, we combine our network model with a hierarchical
Bayesian parameter inference and apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain
posterior distributions to our model uncertainties.

Results
Reduced mobility drastically reduces the effective reproduction number– Figure 2 shows the relative change in air and car traffic with respect to baseline before
the outbreak in early February 2020. Each dot represents the day at which the
corresponding country reached 100 or more cases. We notice that different countries
share the same overall dynamics: an initial plateau followed by a sudden drop in air
traffic and a rapid drop in car traffic followed by a gradual increase. The data reveal
three interesting trends: First, local mobility decreases before global mobility with
minima in the week of March 17-24 for car and March 24-31 for air traffic. Second, many
countries experience a dramatic reduction of mobility, it seems almost voluntary, before
the national outbreak becomes apparent. Third, there is a clear South-North divide in
reduction of local mobility with Spain and Italy experiencing the largest reduction and
Sweden and Finland the smallest.
Increased mobility only very gradually increase the effective reproduction
number– Figures 2(a & b) show, side by side, the weekly average of the effective
reproduction number and the relative driving mobility. At the early phase of the outbreak,
this heatmap shows that a reduction of driving mobility is followed by a reduction of

the effective reproduction number with a typical delay of about two weeks. At the
later phases, however, an increase in driving mobility in response to a gradual exit
from lockdown does not initiate an equally steep increase in the effective reproduction
number. This lack of symmetry between reduction and increase in mobility suggests
that some other non-pharmaceutical interventions that were adopted in that period may
have taken a more prominent role in controlling the effective reproduction number.

Local mobility is highly correlated with the reproduction number– Following
the suggestion of Fig. 2(a & b) that there is an association between mobility and
disease dynamics, we show in Fig. 3 the evolution of both local mobility and effective
reproduction number for all countries that had at least 100 cases on March 10. To
ensure similar initial conditions, we begin each simulation at the individual date the
country hit 100 confirmed cases. We compute the effective reproduction number, R(t),
by the semi-parametric Gaussian process model and use only the country-specific
mobility data over time as input. We train the Gaussian process model in a hierarchical
manner and share the priors for the model between all countries. The close agreement
of the fit in Fig. 3 indicates that the model is capable of learning the individual behavior
based on shared posteriors. The hierarchical posterior distribution of the adaption time
t∗ in Fig. 3 shows a mean response time of 18.8 ± 2.2 days, with regional variations
ranging from 11.2 days in Austria to 26.7 days in Sweden. We also determined the
associated cross-correlation between the local mobility and the effective reproduction
number. The time lag ∆t varies from the shortest time interval with 14.6 ± 5.6 days to
the longest interval with 30.3 ± 6.3 days. Fig 4(a) suggests a gradual loss of correlation
between reproduction and mobility with increasing time interval length. The ten graphs
of the ten countries compare the correlation versus time lag for six different time
intervals, all starting on March 1, and 72, 87, 102, 117, 132, 147 days long, from red to
blue, as highlighted in Fig 4(d). Increasing the time interval decreases the correlation
and increases the time lag ∆t, indicated by the peak of the individual curves. Fig. 4(b)
summarizes these results across all ten countries as box plots for all six intervals.
Fig. 4(c) shows a similar box plot, but now for three intervals as defined by the effective
reproduction number, the first wave with R(t) ≥ 1, the trough with R(t) < 1, and the
second wave with R(t) ≥ 1. Fig. 4(d) shows the dynamics of the relative infectious
population for each country, and, on top, the six different interval lengths used for the
analysis in Fig. 4(a & b). All ten countries display a similar strong correlation between
the effective reproduction number and the local mobility, albeit with varying time lags ∆t.
Strikingly, with increasing time, this correlation decreases, i.e., the blue curves have
lower peaks than the red curves, and the time lag increases, i.e., the peaks of the blue
curve are further to the right than those of the red curves.
Mobility and reproduction number define pandemic staging– We can now combine
both global and local mobility data together with the effective reproduction number to
define typical staging dynamics. In Fig. 1, we use a network model for global mobility
coupled with the local mobility data at each node. Following the disease outbreak in
phase I, the first transition occurs following a drop in local mobility associated with
changes in behavior such as working at home or limit on gatherings, and corresponds to

control and some level of lockdown were established during the following phase II as
indicated through the vertical dashed lines in Fig. 3, see also Fig. 1(c). The second
transition occurs when, similarly, air traffic drops with its corresponding inflection point.
During phase III, there is a slow increase in local mobility associated with a decrease
in the overall reproduction number, which is still larger than one R(t) ≥ 1. The third
transition between phases III and IV marks the end of the first wave and corresponds to
the peak of the number of new cases. After this transition, in phase IV, the reproduction
number remains consistently smaller than one, R(t) < 1, despite a gradual increase
in mobility, resulting in a noticeable reduction of new active cases. Phase IV marks
the trough, the valley between the first and second waves. As all countries gradually

of new cases beyond a point, where the effective reproduction number will again

Mobility data can be used to forecast reproduction– The observed high correlation

of around 14 days, suggests that we can use mobility data as a barometer for the
reproduction number. In Fig. 5 we show two different training scenarios where we

tested the prediction for the 14 days from April 19 to May 2 for Germany and the United
Kingdom. In the first scenario, we used data from February 28 until April 19 for training.
This period includes a rapid change in car traffic and the implementation of several
different control strategies. The second period starts at the point where local mobility
is close to a minimum in Europe, therefore we included case data after March 25 into
the training dataset. We observe that, although a smaller training set is used, the
model prediction for the effective reproduction number is better and fully captures the
reproduction dynamics. Figure S3 demonstrates this predictive capabilities of the model
for all ten countries.

Figure 6: Dynamics of a super-spreading event. (a) The Heinsberg Carnival took
place between February 20 and 26 (shaded region) and is associated with a large
spike in mobility data in the nearby city of Cologne. (b) It is correlated with a local
increase of the reproduction number in Cologne, approximately 17 days delayed, and a
national increase, approximately 40 days delayed. Cases are depicted as cumulative
case numbers.
Local mobility data can be used to identify possible super-spreading events–
Super-spreading events are characterized by a local outbreak when a large population
comes in close contact for a significant period of time. Examples includes sporting
events, parades, festivals, religious ceremonies, and carnivals. Unavoidably, these
events are associated with large population movement and can be captured by mobility
data. For instance, the Carnival season between February 20 and 26 in the Heinsberg
district drew large crowds and it is believed to be the first COVID-19 hotspot in Germany
(16). Figure 6 shows the mobility data of the city of Cologne, approximately 70km
from Heinsberg. The spike in mobility is directly followed by the epidemic outbreak and
correlated with a change in the reproduction number with a adaptation time of 17 days.
This highly-localized event rippled across the entire country with a adaptation time of
about 40 days.

Discussion
The objective of this study was to explore to which extent global and local mobility
are correlated with the effective reproduction number, and, accordingly, with the

local outbreak dynamics. Using passenger air travel, cell phone mobility data,
and reported COVID-19 cases across Europe, we showed that mobility and reproduction are correlated during the early stages of the outbreak, but become
decorrelated during later stages. Interestingly, our study identified four distinct phases of
the outbreak across all European countries that implemented political counter measures.
Phase 0: During the early stages of the pandemic, global mobility modulates the
initial outbreak pattern– Various studies have shown that, especially during the very
early stages of an outbreak, there is a close correlation between mobility and spreading
of an infectious disease. For instance, the early pattern of COVID-19 closely mimics
passenger air travel (17). Global mobility is key to seed the disease in new locations
before its local growth. Tight travel restrictions and border control, first implemented
in the United States, and then in the entire European Union, mark the end of this
phase in Mid March. In response, air travel within the European Union dropped by 95%
within less than two weeks. Yet, it is becoming increasingly clear now that most travel
restrictions were implemented too late to protect any country from a local outbreak
of COVID-19 (6). While global mobility as in Fig. S4 can be an important modulator
at very low or zero case numbers (18), our study suggests that a country-specific
analysis based on local mobility alone as in Fig. 3 is probably sufficient to explain the
major outbreak dynamics. In addition the current study focuses only on mobility, while
other factors, for example, self-adopted human behavioral changes, could show similar
correlation patterns.
Phase I: Once a location is hit by the pandemic, exponential growth governs
the local outbreak dynamics– After local seeding, the outbreak dynamics become
decorrelated from global mobility. Instead, the local number of cases increases rapidly
and the question of health care resources becomes the focal point in political decision
making. At this point, without any additional measures, the outbreak would naturally
peak and decay towards the endemic equilibrium (26). The timing of the peak, its
magnitude, and condition of herd immunity are determined by the basic reproduction
number (20). For COVID-19, the basic reproduction number R0 is on the order of three
to six (19), for which models would predict a peak of active cases from 21% to 39% of
the population, occurring between days 46 and 23, and herd immunity after 67% to 86%
of the population have become infected.
Phase II: Outbreak control modulates the effective reproduction number by
reducing local mobility– To stop the period of exponential growth, political measures,
including local lockdown and limit to gatherings, have been implemented in almost
all European countries to limit contact between infectious and susceptible individuals.

The rapid reduction of car traffic to 40±21% within less than two weeks in early March
is an indicator for a successful contact reduction. A clear limitation of our study is
the use of Apple mobility data (23) as a proxy for the local mobility of individuals
within a country. A comparison with alternative provider-based mobility data (25)
shows that, at least for the example of Germany, the Apple data overestimate the
true reduction in mobility by up to 25%. This suggests that the Apple data are biased
towards a subset of the population that can potentially respond more rapidly and
more flexibly to the new stay-at-home conditions. While we clearly have to be careful
to draw conclusions from mobility in absolute numbers, we believe that the general
trends are indicative of a universal reduction in mobility within the general population.
Strikingly, in most countries, this reduction emerged naturally, well ahead of political intervention, as a result of voluntary behavioral changes in the population, see Fig. 2.
Phase III: Reduced mobility reduces the number of new cases and initiates a
flattening of the curve–In the outbreak dynamics, reduced local mobility induces
a reduction of the effective reproduction number Rt and with it convergence to an
enforced equilibrium state, a converged state under given constraints, long before herd
immunity is achieved in the entire population. The speed and magnitude by which
the reproduction number drops are a measure of the effectiveness of public health
interventions. For example, in Austria, a country that is known for its strict response to
the pandemic Rt dropped from 4.0 to 1.1 in only 16 days; in Sweden, a country that
implemented relatively lose public restrictions it dropped from 2.0 to 1.1 in as much as
33 days. A limitation of our study is its sensitivity with respect to the date of reporting,
which can vary significantly between the different countries. We illustrate the impact of
drawing the data from two different days of reporting, the onset of symptoms and the
reported test results, and show the resulting time shift for the example of Germany in
Fig. S2. In the hypothetical case of complete lockdown, the number of new cases, and
with it the effective reproduction number, would go to zero. However, Fig. 1(c) shows
that even under the strict political constraints imposed in most European countries, the
average duration from the point a country hit 100 cases until the reproduction number
went down to one is 38 ± 8 days. As long as Rt remains lower than one, the number of
new cases continues to decrease, although gradually.
Phase IV: The gradual exit from lockdown reveals the effect of social learning–
Following a period of rigorous lockdown, most European governments have begun to
slowly relax the strict measures to reduce movement and contacts. This relaxation
is clearly reflected in the mobility data in Fig. 2 as a slow increase of local mobility.
Two important features are now becoming apparent: First, there is an asymmetry in
the decrease and increase of the reproduction number before and after lockdown

that can be attributed to social learning and soft political intervention including face
masks, physical distancing, and no large gatherings. Second, variations in the
reproduction number during the early phases are highly correlated with changes
in local mobility, while later they are not. Our analysis with training and testing
suggests that, as long as the disease remains endemic, trends in local mobility allow
us to forecast the outbreak dynamics for a two weeks window. This correlation has
potentially important consequences: Some proposed exit strategies suggest either
periodic or on-demand lockdown once the number of new cases begins to rise again.
The general objective of most outbreak control strategies is to keep the effective
reproduction number either strictly below one or slightly above. The problem with the
latter approach is that by the time a critical rise becomes observable, the inertia of the
exponential dynamics is already difficult to control and long periods of lockdown would
become necessary to manage the overall outbreak dynamics. Our study shows that
mobility data can serve as a barometer to adjust particular sectors of the economy,
in real time, to maintain future effective reproduction numbers smaller than one.
Importantly, in this approach, the forecast of the reproduction number, the correlation
levels, and the window of correlation can be updated daily as new data become available.
2nd Wave: Complete decorrelation between mobility and reproduction indicates
the end of the first wave–In the case of COVID-19, during the early stages of exponential growth, almost all European countries experienced a strong reduction in local
mobility. Around Mid March, numerous political measures were implemented in different
stages, ranging from prohibiting gatherings to complete lockdown, with a restriction
to essential business only. During this period, the virus spread non-linearly across
Europe, see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4(c). Throughout this time window, individual mobility had a
massive potential to accelerate the outbreak and generate large effective reproduction
numbers. This agrees well with our observation of a distinct time lag and associated
strong correlations between mobility and reproduction among all European countries
within the full dataset, see Fig. 4(a). Due to behavioral changes after the first phase of
the outbreak, our analysis suggests that the time lag increased from initially 14.6 ± 5.6
to 30.3 ± 6.3 days, before mobility and reproduction decorrelate. This is clearly visible in
the cross-correlation for different time intervals of the dataset, see Fig. 4(a & b). The
decorrelation begins after the infectious curve peaked, i.e., R(t) ≤ 1, and the dynamics
of traffic and reproduction become increasingly independent as the effective reproduction approaches zero. In this range, the amount of infectious individuals is too low to be
amplified by human mobility. For example, for the case of Austria, which was among
the first countries in Europe to aggressively implement outbreak control, we observe an
early peak at the end of April in Fig. 4(c). Austria was one of the first countries worldwide to report an effective reproduction number below one, which resulted in an early

decorrelation and a vanishing distinct time shift between local mobility and reproduction,
see Fig 4(a). The effect of decorrelation at low new case numbers is inherently built into
our model: The latent variable formulation of the effective reproduction number R(t), as
a function of local mobility within the SEIR model, become increasingly less sensitive to
mobility changes for a low infectious population. This trend is robust and also holds for
more complex compartment models including the SEIIRD model with an undetected
population of asymptomatic individuals and a simultaneously fitted deceased population
as we show in Fig. S1. Interestingly, the new increase of the effective reproduction
number beyond one, R(t) ≥ 1, in response to the gradual exit marks a new increase in
cases and the beginning of the second wave, that we can clearly see in Figs. 1 and 3.
Taken together, the strong correlation between mobility and reproduction in the endemic
phase, and the loss of correlation in the later phases, suggest that mobility is a reliable
predictor of to predict outbreak dynamics. Our study suggests that biweekly mobility
trends can be used to stratify different phases of the pandemic, identify super-spreading
events, and guide political decision making. Mobility is a suitable pandemic barometer.

Methods
The foundation of our modeling methodology, to account for human activity at different
scales, is the standard Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Recovered SEIR compartment model. We model the inter-country specific outbreak dynamics using a network
of passenger air travel between individual countries, combined with the local driving
mobility at the nodal level. To account for our prior knowledge of the model parameters
and the available data for each country, we combine our network model with a hierarchical Bayesian parameter inference by applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to
obtain posterior distributions for uncertainty quantification.

COVID-19 outbreak data, global and local mobility
We draw the COVID-19 outbreak data for 26 European countries from the reported
confirmed cases from February 24, 2020 (21). From these data, we extract the new
ˆ = I(tn+1 ) − I(tn ), as the difference between today’s and yesterreported cases, ∆I(t)
day’s reported cases (18). To estimate global mobility, we use the passenger air travel
data between any two European countries (22), normalized by the baseline mean air
travel volume from 15 January to 15 February 2020 (24). To approximate local mobility,
we use the Apple mobility data that summarizes the relative volume of location requests
per country, region, subregion, or city, normalized by the baseline volume on 13 January
2020 (23). We smoothen the weekday-weekend fluctuations in outbreak and mobility

data by applying a moving averaging window of seven days. We analyze the data
from the country-specific first day of the outbreak on which 100 infected individuals are
reported in each of the 26 European countries as illustrated in Fig. S4.

Local epidemiology modeling
We model the local epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak using an SEIR model with
four compartments, the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations,
governed by a set of ordinary differential equations (29),

= + β(t) S I − α E

The transition rates between the four compartments, β(t), α, and γ are inverses of
the contact period B(t) = 1/β(t), the latent period A = 1/α, and the infectious period
C = 1/γ. We interpret the latent and infectious periods A and C as disease-specific,
and the contact period B(t) as behavior specific. Using the dynamic contact period
B(t), we calculate the effective reproduction number R(t) = C/B(t) as an important
measure to quantify the current outbreak dynamics.

Global network modeling
We model global mobility using European passenger air travel within a weighted undirected graph G with N = 26 nodes and E = 201 edges (17). The nodes represent
the individual countries, the edges the most traveled connections between them. We
weight the edges by the estimated annual incoming and outgoing passenger air travel
statistics (24) from which we create the adjacency matrix, Aij , that represents the travel
frequency between two countries i and j, and the degree matrix,
Dii = diag

that represents the number of incoming and outgoing passengers for each country i.
The difference between the degree matrix Dij and the adjacency matrix Aij defines the
weighted graph Laplacian (17, 28),
Lij = Dij − Aij .

Fig. 1(b) illustrates the discrete graph G of the European Union. The size and color of

Germany, 221 million in Spain, 162 million in France, and 153 million in Italy to just 3
million in Estonia and Slovakia, and 2 million in Slovenia, with a mean degree of 48 ± 64

across the European countries and the United Kingdom (24) normalize it such that its
largest coefficient is equal to one, and then scale it with the air mobility coefficient ϑ.
We discretize our SEIR model on our weighted graph G and introduce the susceptible,
exposed, infectious, and recovered populations Si , Ei , Ii , and Ri as global unknowns at
the i = 1, ..., N nodes of the graph G. This results in the spatial discretization of the set

Human mobility modeling
It is useful to capture the general trend of mobility through simple mathematical expression so that they can be easily integrated within the epidemiological model. Here, we
introduce a simple ansatz for the global and local mobility. The early phases of the
outbreak are characterized by a smooth mobility transition from the initial baseline mobility to a reduced mobility induced by behavioral changes in the population. Previously,
we have modeled this transition by a hyperbolic tangent-type ansatz (29). Here we
generalize this approach by taking into account policy relaxations and social adaptations
through a combination of exponentials,

where y0 denotes the baseline value, t∗ is the adaptation time, T is the transition time,
and P (t) is the adaptation after the initial drop. For the global mobility, European air
traffic dropped to a constant plateau of 5% until the end of May 2020, and we select
a constant P (t) to model this plateau, see Fig. 1(a). For the local mobility, driving
mobility steadily increased after an initial drop at the end of March 2020, and we select
a quadratic polynomial P (t) to represent this increase, see Fig. 1 (a). We assume that
the the effective reproduction number follows these mobility patterns, we apply the same

This functional form describes a smooth transition from the basic reproduction number
R0 at the beginning of the outbreak to the current reproduction number Rt . We model
the effect of the individual mobility on the outbreak dynamics after the initial mobility drop
by postulating that the current reproduction number (6) is a function of the time-varying
individual mobility Rt = f [xm (t)]. To keep our mobility model simple, interpretable,
and capable of handling real-world data, we adopt a stochastic process approach to
define Rt (xm [t]) and construct a Gaussian process latent variable model. The Gaussian
process model can be considered as a prior distribution for the mapping function (30),
Rt (xm ) ∼ GP {µ(xm ), k [xm , x0m ]} ,

(7)

which draws function values from a multivariate normal distribution, parameterized by
the mean function µ(xm ) and the covariance function k [xm , x0m ], while assuming Rt (xm )
to be constant within a time window of two days. To account for a smooth non-linear
mapping from the latent to the data space, we choose an exponentiated quadratic form
covariance function with the two kernel hyperparameters η 2 and `2 (31, 32). A powerful
way to stabilize time-series predicting models is to enable trend changes at learned time
points Sp with the aid of weakly informative priors (33). These change points can be at
any given time point sj with j = 1, 2, ..., Sp . Here we apply a simple piece-wise linear
trend change in the mean function (33),

where m is the offset, δ is the rate adjustment, k is the growth rate, and γ enforces

Bayesian parameter inference
We need to estimate a set of 12 parameters including a set of four parameters for
the local SEIR model, θSEIR = { α, γ, E0 , I0 }, a set of seven parameters for the semiparameteric model, θRt = { t∗ , T, η 2 , `2 , k, m, δ}, and one parameter for the network
model ϑ(t). We estimate the mobility parameter ϑ(t) by fitting Eq. (5) against the
aviation data in Fig. 1(a) and multiplying it with a scaling prior ϑ0 . We fix the latency
period to A = 2.5 days and the infectious period to C = 6.5 days. Previous studies had
reported a mean incubation period on the order of A = 5.0 days (34, 35, 40), with the
actual infectiousness starting already A = 2.3 days after exposure (27), which is well

in line with our previous findings of A = 2.6 days (28) and with the value of A = 2.5
days we selected here. The infectious period and varies strongly in the literature from
C = 1.5 days to C = 4.0 days up to distributions with a quick decline after C = 7.0
days (27, 34), which motivated our current choice of C = 6.5 days. We estimate the
remaining set of model parameters θ = θSEIR ∪ θRt ∪ {ϑ0 } using Bayesian inference

which we infer approximately by employing the NO-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) (38) implementation of the Python package PyMC3 (39). To account for variability between
the individual countries, while simultaneously taking advantage of the entire dataset,
we adopt a hierarchical model to learn the effective reproduction number on the basis
of the case and mobility data. We postulate that during the initial phase, the effective
reproduction number is primarily governed by the local political action in each country, while during the later phases, it becomes strongly correlated with local mobility
that mimics the new levels of social awareness. We apply hierarchical priors on the
parameters of the initial phase, i.e., the basic reproduction number R0 , and the adaptation and transition times t∗ and T , and define shared priors on the semi-parametric
Gaussian process latent model of the later phases. For each county i, we draw R0i
and t∗i from normal distributions, R0i ∼ Ni (R0i , σR0 ) and t∗i ∼ Ni (t∗i , σt∗ ), and Ti from a
log-normal distribution, Ti ∼ Ni (T, σT ), and model the hyper standard deviation priors
by half-normal distributions. We design the Gaussian process latent variable model
with shared priors for all countries and inform it by the time-varying local mobility data.
Here we make use of two hyperparameters for the kernel functions η 2 and `2 . For the
forecasting models, we construct a linear-piece-wise means functions defined by three
parameters drawn from normal distributions to stabilize the predictive capabilities. We
select three equidistant change points, Sp = 3, for the piece-wise linear function. Rather
than using a change point detection to identify the number and location of change points,

we select three equidistant points to prevent overfitting and keep the prior distributions
at a moderate level and to maintain flexibility in adjusting the change rate by using a
sparse prior on the rate adjustment δ. For the network model, we include one additional
weakly informative prior for the scaling of the travel coefficient as a normal distribution
ϑ0 ∼ Ni (0.4, 0.3). Table S2 summarizes all priors on the model parameters.

Supplementary Material
Local epidemiology modeling - SEIIRD model
To illustrate that our method is robust to disease parameters beyond the classical
SEIR model, we expand the SEIR model for the local epidemiology of COVID-19
from Eq. (1) to an SEIIRD model with six compartments, the susceptible, exposed,
detected infectious, hidden infectious, recovered, and deceased populations. These six
compartments are governed by the following set of ordinary differential equations,
Ṡ
Ė
I˙d
I˙h
Ṙ
Ḋ

= − β(t) S [Is + Ia ]
= + β(t) S [Is + Ia ] −
αE
=
+
νd α E
− [1 − νf ] γ Id − νf σ Id
=
+ [1 − νd ] α E − γ Ih
=
+ γ Ih + [1 − νf ] γ Id
=
+ νf σ Id

(S.1)

The transition rates between the compartments, β(t), α, γ, and σ are inverses of the
contact period B(t) = 1/β(t), the latent period A = 1/α, the infectious period C = 1/γ,
and the survival period SD = 1/σ. The SEIIRD model splits the initial infectious group of
the SEIR model in Eq. (1) into a detected group, Id = νd I, and a hidden undetected
group, Ih = νh I, where νd is the detection fraction and νh = 1 − νd . From the detected
group Id , individuals can transition into the recovered group R at a fraction [1 − νf ] or into
the deceased group D at a fraction νf , where νf is the case fatality rate. We interpret the
latent, infectious and survival periods A, C, and SD as disease-specific and static, and
the contact period B(t) as behavior specific and dynamic. Using the dynamic contact
period B(t), we calculate the effective reproduction number R(t) = C/B(t) to quantify
the outbreak dynamics.
We need to estimate a set of 15 parameters including a set of eight parameters for the
SEIIRD model, θSEIIRD = { α, γ, σ, νd , νf , E0 , Id,0 , Ih,0 }, and a set of seven parameters
for the semi-parametric model, θRt = { t∗ , T, η 2 , `2 , k, m, δ}. As before, we estimate the
model parameter set θ ∗ = θSEIIRD ∪ θRt using Bayesian inference with Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sampling. We fix the latency and infectious periods to A = 2.5 days and
C = 6.5 days. In contrast to the SEIR model, we now fit two data sets simultaneously,
the new daily detected cases, ∆Iˆd (t) = Iˆd (tn+1 ) − Iˆd (tn ), and the daily new deaths,
∆D̂(t) = D̂(tn+1 ) − D̂(tn ), which we extract as the differences between the today’s and
yesterday’s confirmed cases and deaths (2) and smoothen using a seven-day moving
average on the data. For both fits, we adopted a Student’s t-distribution for the likelihood
between the new daily reported data, ∆Iˆd (t) and ∆D̂(t), and the model predictions,
∆Id (t, θ ∗ ) and ∆D(t, θ ∗ ), with new-case- and new-deaths-number-dependent widths (1),

where σI and σD represent the widths of the likelihoods p(∆Iˆd (t)|θ ∗ ) and p(∆D̂(t)|θ ∗ )
between the daily new reported cases and deaths ∆Iˆd and ∆D̂ and the associated
modeled new cases and deaths ∆Id and ∆D. Again, we apply Bayes’ rule to obtain the
posterior distributions of the parameters on the basis of the prior distributions specified in
Table S3, and the reported cases and deaths themselves, which we infer approximately
by employing the NO-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) (4) implementation of the Python package
PyMC3 (6).
Fig. S1 shows the reported and simulated cases and deaths across Europe. The
hierarchical SEIIRD model learns the time-varying effective reproduction number R(t)
from both the reported cases and deaths in Fig. S1 (a) for varying adaptation times
t∗ . The learnt survival period is SD = 6.62 ± 0.14 days. The adaptation time distribution
in Fig. S1 (b) indicates an adaptation time of t∗ = 16.6 ± 2.8 days. The box plots in
Figs. S1 (c & d) show the country-specific case fatality rates νf and detection fractions
νd . These results suggest that our method is not only applicable to the classical SEIR
model but extends equally to more sophisticated models like the SEIIRD model with
additional hidden and deceased compartments, and can not only fit the reported case
data, but also simultaneously reported cases and deaths.

Sensitivity with respect to date of reporting
ˆ from a central
In our main study, we interpret the daily reported case number ∆I(t)
European data base (2) as the infectious population and fit this case number against
the daily change of the infectious population ∆I(t, θ) of our SEIR model. Arguably,
the “date of reporting” can mean different things for different countries, and it can vary
hugely between infection, symptom onset, testing, positive confirmed, and reporting.
This implies that our time delay between mobility and reproduction is highly sensitive to
the local testing logistics.
Table S1 illustrates difference between symptom onset and reporting for four representative countries (3). For example, in Germany, the “date of reporting” represents
the date at which a sample swab is sent to laboratory testing, although the actual date
at which authorities are notified will be several days later. To illustrate the difference
between symptom onset and reporting, we perform the same SEIR model analysis
ˆ
based on two different reported data sets I(t),
symptom onset data from the Robert
Koch Institute (5) and reporting data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (2), which includes the data that we used throughout this study.

adaptation time distributions vary between t∗ = 8.10 ± 0.52 days for the system onset
data and t∗ = 16.80 ± 1.49 days for the reported data with a mean difference of 8.7 days.
This study highlights the sensitivity of the data to the reporting logistics. Unfortunately,
system onset data were not available for all countries in the European Union, and we
can only show the sensitivity here, rather than using system onset data throughout our
entire study, which would have been more unified and accurate.

ten European countries. Fig. S3 (a) uses the full available data set, whereas Fig. S3 (b)
