Abstract
Background: Passive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP)
represents a promising alternative for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The efficacy of CP therapy has been associated with high titers of neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs) in the plasma of recovered patients, but the assays for
quantifying nAbs are not widely available. Our goal was to develop a strategy to
predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of the CP potential donors.
Methods: Two hundred and fourteen CP donors were enrolled and tested for the
presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two commercial immunoassays
(IA): Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN and Anti-SARS-CoV-2
Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott. In parallel, quantification of neutralizing
antibodies (nAbs) was performed using the Cytopathic effect-based virus
neutralization test (CPE-VNT). Three criteria for identifying donors with high titers
of nAbs (≥1:160) were tested: - Criterion1: Curve ROC Method; - Criterion 2:
Conditional decision tree considering only the results from the IA and –Criterion
3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables.
Results: The performance of Abbott and EUROIMMUN immunoassays was
similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers ≥
1:160. Regarding the three studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high
nAbs titers (≥ 1:160): 1) Criterion 1 showed 76.1% accuracy when the S/CO cutoff of 4.65 was used, 2) Criterion 2 presented 76.1% accuracy if the S/CO ≥ 4.57
was applied and 3) Criterion 3 had 71.6% accuracy if either S/CO ≥ 4.57 or S/CO
between 2.68 and 4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms occurred less
than 19 days from donor recruiting were used.
Conclusion: The results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to
predict high nAbs titers of potential CP donors. This study has proposed three
different criteria for identifying donors with ≥ 1:160 nAbs titer based on either
solely S/CO results or S/CO together with clinical variables, all with high efficacy
and accuracy.

Introduction

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) represents an unprecedent challenge for the population, health workers and
government all over the world, becoming a global public health emergency with
growing impact on the global economy. On 11th March 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. As of August 23th, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 infection reached about 23 million confirmed cases worldwide in
more

than

213

countries

and

caused

more

than

800,000

deaths

(https://covid19.who.int). To date, no specific treatment was proved to be effective

for SARS-CoV-2 infection, beside supportive care.
Passive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP), a classic adaptive
immunotherapy, has been applied to the prevention and treatment of many
infectious diseases over many decades, from A/H1N1 Spanish Flu in 1917-1918
to SARS in 2012. 1 The efficacy of passive antibody therapy has been associated
with the concentration of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in plasma of recovered
patients.2 CP from patients who have recovered from viral infection can be used
to improve clinical conditions and survival rate of patients with acute viral
infections, including SARS-CoV-2, without severe adverse effects. Preliminary
data showed a reduction of viral load, shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in
patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 treated with CP in comparison to those who
were not.3,4-8
Possible mechanisms related to the efficacy of CP therapy in SARS-CoV-2
include

the

passive

transfusion

of

neutralizing

antibodies

and

an

immunomodulatory effect via amelioration of severe inflammatory response.9,10
Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develop a primary immune response
by days 10–14, which is followed by virus clearance.11 Therefore, theoretically, it
should be more effective to administer the CP at the early stage of disease. A
recent matched study suggested that non-intubated patients may benefit more
than those requiring mechanical ventilation.12 However, other treatments might

influence the relationship between CP and antibody level, including antiviral
drugs, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin.
We are conducting a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of CP
for patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Convalescent donors
have been recruited from the community. Pre-requisite for plasma donation
include age (>18 years old); no previous pregnancy; time elapsed from the last
day of symptoms (> 14 days); laboratorial evidence of prior infection by SARSCoV-2; and screening negative for infectious diseases transmissible for blood
(HIV 1+2, HTLV 1+2, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and Chagas Disease). Moreover,
we also have evaluated the level of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and the
absence of RNAemia in a blood samples before plasma collection. As nAbs play
important roles on virus clearance and have been considered as a key immune
product for treatment against viral diseases, in concordance with Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), we stablished that CP unit for transfusion should contain
nAbs with minimum titer of ≥1:160 (https://www.fda.gov/media/136798/download).
However, neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2 are limited in availability and
throughput, requiring biosafety level 3 facilities and skilled labor. Since such
assay is often unavailable, one alternative is to perform the test later in a stored
sample, or to perform another test to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody prior to issuing the plasma unit for transfusion.
The correlation between immunoassays antibodies titers and neutralizing
antibodies has not been thoroughly investigated and the knowledge of this
association can help to make better therapeutic decisions.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of criteria based on the
results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays for the prediction of high nAbs titers
in CP donors.

Two hundred and sixty-three convalescent individuals were evaluated in April
2020 for plasma convalescent donation by apheresis. The SARS-Cov-2
infection was previously confirmed by Real Time Reverse TranscriptionPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) of material collected from the upper
respiratory tract (nasopharynx or oropharynx). All candidates provided written
informed consent and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Blood
samples were collected from all participants for performing the SARS-CoV-2 IgG
immunoassay and blood RT-PCR. Two hundred and fourteen were tested for
neutralizing antibodies.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoassays
Two commercials immunoassays comprising the structural protein of SARS-CoV2 (S1 domain) were tested in parallel with all collected samples: Anti-SARS-CoV2 ELISA IgG EUROIMMUN (Lübeck, Germany) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2
Chemiluminescence IgG Abbott (Chicago, US). Tests were performed in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
Blood samples with DO/CO ≥ 3 on the IgG immunoassay were subjected to
SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR using TaqMan method. A quantitative in house real-time
PCR assay amplifying the virus RdRp RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and
envelope was applied to determine the copy number of SARS-CoV-2.13 The test
had sensitivity of approximately 100 copies/mL. In all amplification reactions,
positive and negative controls and an exogenous internal control were used.
Cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-VNT)
Two hundred and fourteen samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)
using the cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-VNT). The CPEVNT was adapted from Nurtop et al., 201814 and have been already described
on Wendel et al., 202015. Briefly, 5x104 cells/mL of Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81)
were seeded 24 hours before the infection in a 96-well plate. Plasma samples
were, initially, inactivated for 30 min at 56°C. We used 8 dilutions (two-fold) of
each plasma (1:20 to 1:2560). Subsequently, plasma was mixed vol/vol with 103

TCID50/mL of SARS-CoV-2/human/BRA/SP02cc/2020 strain virus (GenBanK
access number: MT350282.1)16 and pre-incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to allow
virus neutralization. Then, the plasma plus virus mixture was transferred onto the
confluent cell monolayer and incubated for 3 days at 37°C, under 5% CO2. Virus
neutralization titer referred to VNT100 is described as the highest dilution of serum
that neutralized virus growth (absence of cytopathic effect). In each assay, a
strong, assured internal positive control serum (RT-qPCR positive +
PRNT90>640)17 was used, as a negative pre-outbreak serum sample. All the
procedures related to CPE-VNT were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory,
in accordance with WHO recommendations18.

Statistical analysis
A descriptive analysis was carried out using frequencies, central tendency and
position measures. Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric tests were
used to compare nAbs values in different groups and Bonferroni post-hoc method
was applied to adjust results for multiple comparisons. The variables age and
days since last symptom were tested according to groups from tertiles of the
distribution values.
Simple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between
ELISA S/CO values and the concentration of nAbs titers. The predictive value of
immunoassays tests (Abbott and Euroimmun) for the identification of nAbs ≥ 160
was assessed using ROC curve graphs.19 Then, the sensitivity, specificity,
predictive values and accuracy of four cut-off points obtained by different
methods were calculated: a) The Youden´s index method which maximizes the
sum between Sensitivity and Specificity; b) The ‘Maximum Efficiency’ method
which is based on the maximization of the frequency of cases correctly classified
(true positives or true negatives); c) The ‘PROC01’ method which is the point on
the ROC curve closest to the point to the point (0,1) or upper left corner of the
graph; d) a last method which established a fixed value for sensitivity (= 90%)
and sought to maximize specificity.[ref 19/20]
To validate the proposed donation criteria, the total sample studied was divided
into two parts (development sample and validation sample) according to the study

enrollment date. For this analysis, the initial sample of 214 donors was divided
into tertiles according to the date of the enrollment. The first two thirds of sample
(development sample) were used to develop the criteria, while the last third of the
sample (validation sample) was used to assess the performance of the proposed
criteria. Three different criteria have been developed; (1-) the first criterion
established a S/CO cut-off point of 4.65 based on the Youden´s index method;
(2-) the second criterion was established based on the results of a simple
conditional decision tree model using only the result of the ELISA test as an
explanatory variable and (3-) the third criterion was established based on the
results of a multivariate conditional decision tree model using the ELISA test
result and the following variables: age, sex, need for hospitalization for treatment
of SARS-CoV-2, and the time elapsed since the end of symptoms. All analyzes
were performed in the R environment using RStudio software.19,20

Results
Studied population of donors
There were 263 potential CP donors evaluated, of whom 49 were excluded from
the analysis either because nAbs titers were lacking (n=35) or because the
evaluation was performed less than 10 days after the symptom resolution (n=14)
(Figure1).
Table1 shows the descriptive data of the analyzed sample. Most donors were
male (57.9%) and young (median age was 35 years/IQR=15). The two most
common clinical comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension (8.7%) and
pulmonary disease (6.5%).

Correlation between nAbs titers and clinical / demographics factors
The titers of nAbs of the studied sample varied widely Approximately 1 in each 5
donors (19.1%) had nAbs titers <1:80 (Figure2). Titers were significantly higher
among: 1) men (difference of median=160 nAbs, p<0.001), 2) individuals in the
upper tertile ofage (difference of median to lower tertile=160 nAbs, p=0.003) and

3) individuals who needed hospitalization to treat SARS-CoV-2 (difference of
median=1,120 nAbs, p<0.001). Donors with a shorter time between the end of
symptoms and the enrollment had slightly higher nAbs titer, but without statistical
significance (p=0.067) (Figure3).
Performance of the evaluated immunoassays
The distribution of the S/CO values obtained from the two evaluated
immunoassays (Abbott and Euroimmun) is shown in Figure4, letter A. A very
similar distribution was noted. Median values of S/CO were 4.65 (IQR 2.70-7.18)
and 5.61 (IQR 2.72-9.10) for Abbott and Euroimmun, respectively.
There was a positive correlation between S/CO and nAbs titers for both Abbott
(R2=0.617; p<0,001) and Euroimmun (R2=0.526; p<0,001) assays (Figure4, letter
B). Also, the predictive value to identify nAbs titers ≥160 was similar between the
two assays, with AUC value of 0.878 (IQR 0.83-0.92) and 0.885 (IQR 0.84-0.93)
for Abbott and Euroimmun, respectively (p=0.803) (Figure4, letter C). Since both
assays presented similar performance, next results were analyzed using Abbott
kit.
Table2 shows the accuracy measurements of four different cut-offs for the
identification of nAbs values ≥ 160. The cut-off points obtained by the Youden
and Maximum Efficiency methods showed the highest values of accuracy and
area under curve (AUC). The PROC01 and Sensitivity=90% methods showed
slightly lower AUC values despite the high sensitivity values found.
The next step was to determine the accuracy of different S/CO cut-offs for
predicting nAbs titers ≥ 160 (Table2). The cut-off points obtained by the Youden
and Maximum Efficiency methods presented the highest values of accuracy and
area under curve (AUC). The PROC01 and Sensitivity methods showed slightly
lower AUC values despite the high sensitivity values found.
Validation of the S/CO cut-off as criteria for selecting donors with high nAbs
titers

For validating the S/CO optimal cut-off, the initial sample of 214 donors was
divided into tertiles from the date of the interview. The first two thirds
(development sample) were used to develop the criteria, while the last third of the
sample (validation sample) was used to validate the proposed criteria.
The clinical and laboratorial characteristics of the development sample (n = 147)
and validation sample (n = 67) are presented in Table3. The two samples had
very similar characteristics regarding age, gender, nAbs titers, S/CO values and
need for hospitalization. Nevertheless, the time since last symptoms and
recruitment was significantly longer in the validation sample (median 24, IQR 18–
29) days, when compared to the development sample (median 19, IQR 17–24).
Three different criteria for the selection of donors were tested based on the results
obtained in the development sample. Criterion 1 calculated the best cut-off point
for the identification of nAbs titers ≥ 160 according to the Youden´s index method
(S/CO> 4.65). Criteria 2 and 3 were elaborated from conditional decision trees.
Figure5 illustrates the result from conditional tree of criteria 2, which proposed a
criterion for donation considering solely on the result of the immunoassay. In this
model, nine out of ten potential donors (95.9%) with S/CO values > 4.57 had nAbs
titles ≥ 160. On the other hand, the rate of potential donors not eligible for
donation with nAbs titers ≥ 80 was high in the group with positive ELISA 42/55
(76.4%).
The third criterion revealed that all donors with S/CO values > 6.11 had nAbs
titers ≥ 160 (sensitivity = 100%) and one third of the donors (11/33) with the time
since the end of symptoms > 19 days had nAbs titers < 80. All donors with S/CO
values > 2.68 who reported more recent symptom resolution (between 10 and 19
days before recruitment) showed nAbs values ≥ 80. Thus, the third donation
criterion tested in the validation sample provides for the donation based on S/CO
values > 4.57 and S/CO values between 2.68 and 4.57 as long as symptom
resolution has been recent (between 10 and 19 days before recruitment)
(Figure6).

The performance analysis of the three criteria tested in the validation sample
showed similar results. In general, better results were observed for the prediction
of nAbs titers ≥ 1:80 when compared to the results of the prediction of nAbs ≥
160. Criterion 3 demonstrated a reduction in the rate of potential donors
discarded (40.3%) and, above all, in the false negative rate. The overall accuracy
of the prediction of nAbs ≥ 1:80 increased from 71.6% to 76.1% (Table4). On the
other hand, the criterion 3 test in the validation sample also markedly increased
the false positive rate for predicting nAbs ≥ 1:160 (Table5).

Discussion
Passive antibody therapy with convalescent plasma (CP), an adaptive
immunotherapy, is an alternative for patients with SARS-CoV-2 until more
definitive treatments as monoclonal antibody, antiviral drugs or vaccine are
available. This treatment was used more than a century ago during the A/H1N1
Spanish Flu outbreak, in 1917-1918, and more recently for AIDS, MERS, SARS
and EBOLA viral epidemies.1,21-23 It consists in bringing to a patient suffering a
severe and even lethal infection, immunoglobulins and possibly other immune
regulatory factors obtained from plasma of immunized donors. The action
mechanism of plasma therapy is not fully stablished and probably go beyond of
neutralizing antibodies administration. Especially in severe acute respiratory
infections of viral etiology an effect immunomodulatory through administration of
anti-inflammatory cytokines could be involved.9
Up to now, there is no well-designed prospective randomized clinical trial
demonstrating the efficacy of CP against infectious disease. However, Brazilian
Ministry of Health is permitting the use of CP as an investigational treatment for
patients with moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection24. It is considered an
investigational treatment because clinical studies have started but have not yet
been completed. The success of CP is related to the presence of high titers of
nAbs in the donated plasma. To our knowledge, the present study was the first
to correlate the results obtained from two broadly available immunoassays
designed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the nAbs titers.

Our data show good correlation between nAbs titers and S/CO values obtained
from two immunoassays analyzed, Abbott and Euroimmun (p<0.001). These data
have already been observed in other manuscripts that used an immunoassay.2528

However, this is the first report showing a positive correlation between nAbs

tested by an ELISA and a Chemiluminescence assay. This correlation is very
important since many services do not have access to measuring nAbs, and, in
this scenario, an immunoassay can be used as a screening to detect the
presence of antibodies anti SARS-CoV-2 in the samples of convalescent donors.
Also, we have tested three criteria for identifying convalescent plasma donors
with high nAbs titers. According to Youden method, the best cut-off point for the
identification of nAbs titers ≥ 160 is S/CO > 4.65. When a conditional decision
tree model based solely on the result of the immunoassay was evaluated, 95.9%
of potential donors with S/CO values > 4.57 had nAbs titers ≥ 160. Finally, the
conditional decision tree model based not only on the results of the immunoassay
but also on the time of disappearance of the symptoms revealed that all donors
with S/CO values > 6.11 had nAbs titers ≥ 160 (sensitivity = 100%) and all donors
with S/CO values > 2.68 who reported more recent symptom resolution (between
10 and 19 days before recruitment) showed nAbs titers ≥ 80.
Our results confirm that S/CO values can be used to identify donors of CP with
high probability to have therapeutically nAbs titers. These findings support an
algorithm of screening in which donors with S/CO values above 4.57 or with cutoff higher than 2.68 but with time of symptoms resolution under 19 days can be
selected for CP donation with no need to perform nAbs titration. The nAbs
analysis should, then, be restricted to the remaining donors with positive
immunoassay results.
Finally, this study has also demonstrated the wide variability of nAbs titers among
individuals recovered from COVID-19 infection. The titers were higher among
patients of male sex, older age and requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 care.
This data reinforces previous information available in literature.29

We evaluated the performance of Abbott and Euroimmun immunoassays for
convalescent patient’s IgG screening and the correlation between S/CO values
with nAbs titers obtained by CPE-VNT. Our results show that S/CO cut-off value
4.57 can be applied to identify CP units with high nAbs titers. These findings
support a CCP screening algorithm in which immunoassay for IgG testing could
be first performed as a qualification testing and, in the presence of S/CO>4.57,
CP units would be selected for transfusion. CP units with S/CO between 1.1 and
4.57 should be further tested using CPE-VNT to titrate nAbs and be issued for
transfusion based on this result.
