Abstract
This paper studies the effect of air temperature on the transmission of COVID-19 in the
U.S. using daily observations across counties. This study uses various ordinary least
squares (OLS) models with a comprehensive set of fixed effects to overcome unobserved
heterogeneity issues across counties as well as the generalized method of moments (GMM)
estimators as dynamic models to address endogeneity issue. Our main results indicate that
an increase of one degree in temperature is associated with a reduction of 0.041 cases per
100,000 population at the county-level. We run several robustness tests and all the models
confirm the impact of temperature on COVID-19 confirmed new cases. These results help
policymakers and economists in optimizing decisions and investments to reduce COVID19 new cases.

1. Introduction
The world has been faced with the pandemic issue, COVID-19, in 2020 which has
impacted all countries and their economies. This pandemic reminds us of the last pandemic of the
world which was the 1918 influenza pandemic, started in London, United Kingdom. The number
of people death associated with COVID-19 is much higher than previous coronaviruses (i.e.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) so far and still goes up with a huge impact on economies(Bogoch et
al., 2020; Q. Lin et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted both demand and supply of
commodities across the countries in both short-term and long-term. In the short-term, as many
regions (countries and states) adopt strict regulations, their economies slow down significantly 4.
The long-term impacts of this pandemic are a sharp rise in unemployment for individuals and
bankruptcy and a hard time to survive for many businesses(Goodell, 2020; Zhang, Hu, and Ji,
2020).
Based on the official reports, the U.S. has the highest number of infected people (around
30%) by COVID-19 around the world. The amount of money that U.S. imposed on the economy
to support the economy and prevent future recession regarding COVID-19 is more than many
countries‚Äô GDP so far and expects to go higher in near future which would bring more debt for the
Federal Reserve has recently announced that interest rates would drop to a range of 0% 5 to 0.25%
and buy at least $700 billion in government and mortgage-related bonds as a part of their
emergency actions to protect the economy regarding the economic impacts of coronavirus (Long,
2020). The U.S. House passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill on May 2020 (Bellware et al.,
2020) and many economists believe that the U.S. government has committed more than $6 trillion
on the economy during this pandemic (Dam, 2020). Thus, understanding COVID-19 and
estimating the potential factors that may influence its spread is very important for policymakers
and economists.
This study uses an extensive daily panel data sets and applying both static and dynamic
analysis to find the potential link between the level of temperatures across counties and the number
of COVID-19 confirmed new cases. Using a comprehensive set of fixed effects, we find a negative

relationship between lagged levels of temperature and the new confirmed cases. An increase of 10
¬∞ùêπ in temperature of the last 3-14 days reduces the incidence of new confirmed cases by 0.45
counts per 100,000 population, a reduction of roughly 25% from the mean of daily confirmed cases
at the county level.
The contribution of this study to the literature is twofold. First, this is the first county-level
study clarifying the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 new cases. Second, this
study applies several different approaches including static models and dynamic models that allow
us to control for endogeneity and omitted variable biases.
The rest of the study is organized in the following way: Section 2 provides a literature
review; Section 3 shows data and sample selection strategy; Section 4 demonstrates the empirical
strategy; Section 5 reports the results; Section 6 presents discussion and conclusion.

2. Literature Review
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can result in different types of illnesses such as
severe acute respiratory syndrome. A novel coronavirus outbreak started in late 2019 in China and
has since spread at a rapid pace throughout the world. COVID-19 is the respiratory infectious
disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Within a month of the first reported case in China,
horrifying numbers of infections and deaths followed in countries across the globe. The first
confirmed case of COVID-19 in the US was reported on January 21, 2020, in the state of
Washington. Since then, this disease has spread to every state in the US and infected more than
one million people (CDC, 2020).
Researchers have found that COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets
from infected people with symptoms to others and by direct contact with infected people,
contaminated surfaces, and contaminated objects (Liu et al., 2020; Ong et al., 2020). Research on
the preceding types of the novel coronavirus shows that several factors can affect their
transmission. These factors include population density, quality of medical care, ambient
temperature, and humidity (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012; Casanova, Jeon, Rutala, Weber, and
Sobsey, 2010; Dalziel et al., 2018; Lowen, Mubareka, Steel, and Palese, 2007; Noghani and
Noghanibehambari, 2019).
Among the factors influencing the transmission and survival of coronaviruses, the air
temperature has received considerable attention (Otter et al., 2016). Other than the fact that the
virus half-life is increased as temperature decreases (Lowen and Steel, 2014), ambient temperature
can affect the transmission and survival of coronavirus, and consequently the number of infected
people, through two main mechanisms. The first mechanism is that as temperature decreases, the
spread of the virus in the nasal mucosa is improved (Lowen et al., 2007). When the temperature
decreases, cooler air is breathed and thus the nasal mucosa is cooled. Consequently, the viscosity
of the mucous layer increases and the frequency of cilia beats decreases. These conditions will
slow down a mucociliary clearance and help speed the process of spreading the virus into the
respiratory tract (Eccles, 2002). In other words, as temperature decreases, the immunity to the virus
infection decreases(Eccles, 2002; Lowen and Steel, 2014). Furthermore, when the nasal mucosa is
cooled, the virus that has entered the airways will persist there longer (i.e., its half-life is increased)

due to the decreased activities of proteases. Thus, a more effective virus is shed through the
respiratory tract (Lowen et al., 2007; Lowen and Steel, 2014).
The second mechanism is the enhanced survivability of the coronaviruses on surfaces at
lower temperatures (Casanova et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011; van Doremalen, Bushmaker, and
Munster, 2013). Direct contact with contaminated surfaces is one of the main routes of coronavirus
transmission. Previous research has shown that high temperatures can rapidly inactivate
coronaviruses (Lai, Cheng, and Lim, 2005; Pirtle and Beran, 1991). The inactivation on surfaces
at high temperatures can be attributed to two different means, depending on the relative humidity
(Casanova et al., 2010). At low levels of relative humidity, when the temperature increases the
virus is desiccated. The desiccation process results in lipid membrane phase changes, oxidation,
and Maillard reactions (Cox, 1993). Consequently, the virus is inactivated. At high levels of
relative humidity, inactivation with high temperature occurs mainly as a result of the accumulation
of viral capsids at the air-water interface and the resultant structural damages to the virus
(Thompson, Flury, Yates, and Jury, 1998). When the relative humidity is moderate, both processes
occur and result in the inactivation of coronavirus on surfaces (Casanova et al., 2010).
Several laboratory studies have been conducted on the effects of temperature on
transmission and survival of prior coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). For instance, (Casanova et al., 2010)
used two surrogate viruses with similar transmissibility potential to the SARS coronavirus to
model the effects of air temperature on the coronavirus survival on surfaces. The authors
demonstrated a negative effect of air temperature on virus survival on steel surfaces. Similarly,
(Chan et al., 2011) conducted a laboratory study on the survival of SARS coronavirus as a function
of temperature. They found that high temperatures led to a rapid decrease in the virus‚Äôs survival
on surfaces. Apart from these laboratory experiments, several field studies have been conducted
on the effect of temperature, along with other environmental factors, on the spread rate of SARS
disease during the SARS epidemic of the year 2003 (Tan et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2006). For
example, (Lin, Fong, Zhu, and Karlberg, 2006) found that SARS incidences increased by a factor
of 18.18 in days with a lower temperature compared with days with a high temperature in Hong
Kong during March to May of 2003.
Since the start of the novel coronavirus outbreak, there have been few empirical studies
looking at the role of temperature on the incident rate of COVID-19 cases. In one of the first studies

on the subject, (Wang, Tang, Feng, and Lv, 2020) constructed a measure of daily effective
reproductive number as a proxy for the transmission severity of COVID-19. The authors then used
the measure in order to test the effects of temperature and relative humidity on this proxy. Their
results using data on 100 infected cities in China indicated a significant decrease in the
transmission severity of COVID-19 with an increase in temperature. Similarly, using data on
confirmed COVID-19 cases in 188 states or provinces across the world as of February 29,
(Bannister-Tyrrell, Meyer, Faverjon, and Cameron, 2020) have shown a negative relationship
between average temperature and number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Similar results have
been found with data on confirmed cases in China (Xie and Zhu, 2020). Consistent with this notion,
researchers have found that areas with significant community transmission of COVID-19, such as
Northern Italy, Iran, and South Korea, had a similar average temperature of 5-11 degree Celsius,
in 20-30 days prior to the first community spread death (Sajadi et al., 2020). As another example,
scholars used COVID-19 mortality data of Wuhan, China for the period between January 20 to
February 29 and found a significant negative relationship between the number of COVID-19
related deaths in Wuhan and the city‚Äôs ambient temperature (Li et al., 2020).
The above discussion points to a negative relationship between temperature and the
survival and transmission of COVID-19.

In testing this relationship, we make several

contributions. Most importantly, the results of this study can help in planning for the successful
management of COVID-19 spread in the future. Also, we contribute to the literature on the
implications of climate on critical social phenomena. This line of research has shown positive
effects of temperature on criminal activities (Ranson, 2014), negative effects of exposure to
extreme temperatures on birth weight (Desch√™nes, Greenstone, and Guryan, 2009), and negative
effects of global warming on home prices (Butsic, Hanak, and Valletta, 2011).

3. Data and Sample Selection Strategy
The daily county-level data on confirmed cases of Covid-19 is extracted from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I use the county-level population estimates in 2019
from (SEER, 2019) to calculate the daily new confirmed cases per 100,000 residents. The daily
temperature data is from the Global Summary of the Day data files produced by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It gathers a summary of weather data,
including surface temperature, across the globe in a daily basis. Within the US boundaries, there
are over 2,500 stations located across 1,600 counties. We compute the county temperature by
averaging the data of reporting stations within each county. We impute the values for counties
with missing data by taking the average of all neighboring counties‚Äô temperature for a given day.
The Covid-19 data is then merged with the temperature data. We drop counties for which the
population density was above three standard deviations from the mean of population density in
2019. The main reason for this sample restriction is that the new pandemic is contagious in short
distances. Not only it is harder for residents of this county to keep the effective distance but also
the knowledge of the effective distance was unknown for weeks. Therefore, the effect of
temperature on the spread of the pandemic is potentially distorted among these counties. However,
the results are robust without this sample restriction. Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution
of the long-difference of new cases (top panel) and temperature (bottom panel) across US counties.
The final sample includes 3,048 counties that cover all days between January 22, 2020 to
June 13, 2020. A summary statistic of this sample is reported in Table 1. On average, 2.63 new
confirmed cases occur in each county-day. Over the sample period, the average temperature was
about 51 ¬∞ùêπ.

4. Empirical Strategy
The main source of identification is the plausibly exogenous changes in temperature across
counties and over days. The identification strategy compares the new confirmed cases in counties
that have higher within-week raises in temperature to those counties with lower within-week
increases in temperature. It lies on the assumption that in the absence of any changes in
temperature, the spread of the novel Coronavirus in counties with higher changes in temperature
follows the same path and is influenced by the same factors as its spread in counties with lower
changes in temperature.
There are a series of confounding factors that may bias the coefficients. We attempt to
control for these observables and unobservables using a wide array of fixed effects. Each county
has some characteristics that potentially affect its vulnerability and the speed of the spread of
pandemics. For instance, population density, the share of foreign-born residents, or the
composition of local industries, and occupational types are definitely correlated with exposure to
the new disease. As long as these characteristics do not change with time, county fixed effect
controls for them. Time fixed effects account for all unobservable features common across
counties such as the spread of knowledge about social distancing. However, there are unobservable
factors that are specific to a county that also change over time. For example, new kits for screening
arrives which increases testing capacity and raises the number of confirmed cases. To account for
these potentially confounding factors, we can also control for a series of the county by week fixed
effects.
The empirical strategy can be summarized in the Ordinary-Least-Square regressions of the
following form:
ùëÅùëíùë§_ùê∂ùëéùëíùë†
= ùõº + ùõΩùëáùëíùëöùëù

variable ùëáùëíùëöùëù is the temperature of the county in ùúè periods before. The choice of how many days
before the new case is confirmed depends on the incubation period of Covid-19. The exact period
between exposure and infection is still to be known. However, some reports of the World Health
Organization suggest that the average incubation period is 5-6 days while it can be as long as 14

days (WHO, 2020). (Lauer et al., 2020) also report a median of 5 days. In our preferred
specification we focus on the average temperature in the last three to five days, three to eight days,
and also the average of the last three to fourteen.
The parameters ùúÉ and ùúô are a series of dummies to capture the main effects of day and
month. In this model, the main effects of the county, ùõæ , are allowed to vary by week. To account
for time trend features that are specific to each state, such as stay-at-home mandates, that could
vary by month we add an interaction between state fixed effects, ùúÖ, with month fixed effects, ùúÅ.
We also add a series of state-specific time (day-month) trend in some specifications. Finally, ùúñ is
a disturbance term. Since the spread of the new pandemic depends on the social interaction of local
residents, the error terms are possibly serially correlated. We cluster the standard errors at the
county level to account for this serial correlation in the error terms.

5. Results
5.1.

Main Results

The main results are reported in Table 2. An increase of one degree 6 in temperature during
the last 3-14 days is associated with a reduction of 0.048 cases per 100,000 county population.
Adding state-by-month fixed effects (column 2) and also a state-specific linear trend (column 3)
changes the magnitude of the coefficients only slightly. An increase of 16.3 degrees in temperature,
the standard deviation of temperature over the sample period, reduces the new cases by 0.75
incidences per day. This is equivalent to an approximately 28% reduction from the mean of new
confirmed cases over the sample. The respective coefficients are economically large and
statistically significant at 1%. Assuming an incubation period of 3-8 days, the coefficient in our
full model (column 3) shows a significant relationship at 5% between the average temperature
during the incubation period and the number of new cases per 100,000 population. Specifically,
with every one-degree increase in the average temperature, the number of new cases decreases by
0.018. This result has practical significance as it shows that new confirmed cases decrease by 0.29,
which corresponds to a reduction of 11% from the mean when the average temperature increases

by one standard deviation. Columns 1 and 2 show that the effect is quite robust if we exclude the
state-by-month fixed effects and state-specific linear time trends.
The average US temperature varies from roughly 68 degrees in May (the end of our sample)
to around 80 degrees in its peak in August. If we assume that the incubation is between 3-14 days,
the average rise in temperature can reduce the new cases by 0.54 fewer incidences per 100,000
county population per day. To put it into perspective, this rise in temperature avoids roughly 1,800
new cases per day in the country.

5.2.

Robustness Checks

These results could be driven by a sub-population in the data and be smaller or even
opposite-signed in other sub-populations. If so, one can detect the primarily impacted population
and revise any policy suggestion henceforth. Therefore, we checked the robustness of our results
by creating several sub-samples which can theoretically affect our estimates. We ran our analysis
on each of these sub-samples, as depicted in Table 3. We used the same model and the same
dependent variable as in our main analysis with average temperature during the three assumed
incubation periods (the last 3-5, 3-8, and 3-14 days) as the independent variables. In all regressions,
a full specification of equation 1 is applied where in addition to fixed effects, state-by-month
interaction and state-time linear trend is used. As can be seen in Table 3, when we exclude the six
highly infected states, the effects on temperature on new cases remain statistically significant at
1% and the coefficients change slightly. Next, we divided our sample based on unemployment
rate, percentage of male in the county population, percentage of residents with the age 15-30,
population density, and percentage of foreign-born residents. Our analyses show that the
association between the average temperature and the new cases per 100,1000 population is robust
in a majority of sub-samples. However, the relationship goes away for the sub-sample of counties
above the median population of 15-30 years old and above the median population density.
As a further analysis, we also apply a dynamic GMM model with a series of fixed effects.
A summary of our dynamic model is reported in Table 4. Although the point estimates are slightly
smaller than those of the fixed-effect model, they are quite comparable, similar in sign, and
significant at 1% level. For instance, using an incubation period between 3-14 days and applying
a two-step GMM model, 10 degrees rise in temperature is associated with 0.53 fewer incidence of

6. Discussion and Conclusion
The recent pandemic (COVID-19) is considered as the most crucial global health
challenge that impacted both developing and developed countries and their economies since
World War II. The U.S. has one-third of the world's COVID-19 confirmed cases so far and has
the largest number of death due to the pandemic across countries. This study suggested that
daily temperature influences the daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases in the U.S. at the
county-level. we employed panel data from January 22, 2020 to June 13, 2020 covering all
U.S. counties for confirmed cases of the new pandemic as well as the temperature. We used
various static and dynamic models to measure the impact of daily temperature on the number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases at the county level. The main static model indicates that an
increase of one degree in temperature during the last 3-14 days is associated with a reduction
of 0.045 cases per 100,000 population at the county-level. The dynamic results are consistent
with the static findings and confirm that the higher temperature in a county most likely will
drop the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. The results indicate that the two-step system
GMM estimator is more appropriate than a one-step system GMM estimator for measuring the
impact of temperature on the number of cases. These findings could be used by state or national
policymakers to optimize their decisions regarding new policies, regulations, and budget
allocation.
