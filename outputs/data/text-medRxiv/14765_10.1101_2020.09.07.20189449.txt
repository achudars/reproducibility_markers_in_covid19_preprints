Mitigation Strategies and Compliance in the Covid-19 Fight;
How Much Compliance is Enough?

Date: September 1, 2020

ABSTRACT
Today, with only 4% of the world’s population, the U.S. is bearing a disproportionate share of
COVID-19 infections. Seeking to understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies
and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID19 infection. Drilling down to the state level, we create specific state indices suitable for the U.S.
to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. In this, we build on the Oxford
Stringency Index. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as
well as a Compliance Indicator to reduce the transmission, is then estimated with daily data for
a sample of 6 U.S. states. These are New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas,
and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of
mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than
one; this is the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the
pandemic. States successful in combating the pandemic were able to achieve a suitable
combination. Understanding of this relationship by the public and policy makers is key to
controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion
for flexible policy options.

1. INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 20 million infections and 760,213 deaths globally (Johns
Hopkins University & Medicine, 2020). Of these, the U.S. has contributed over 5 million cases,
with 167,253 deaths. This has happened while testing has accelerated in the U.S. According to
the WHO (World Health Organization), the positivity rate in testing (the percentage of tests
conducted that are positive for COVID-19) should be between 3% and 5%. However, before
reopening is considered, the positivity rate should be 5% or below for at least 14 days (WHO,
2020). On August 13, 2020, the U.S. had an overall positive rate of 7.5% (Ritchie, et al., 2020)
which is well above the upper bound recommended. Why is the U.S. then bearing such a
disproportionate burden of infective cases when it has only 4.25% of the world’s population?
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2020)
Clues as to why the overall infections are so high can only be seen by disaggregating to the state
level where we encounter considerable heterogeneity. On August 16, only 17 states had met
the positivity recommendations (Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, 2020).
Further
disparities emerge from the selective adoption by the states (to varying degrees of strictness) of
the community mitigation strategies recommended by the CDC in the absence of a proven and
widely available therapy or vaccine (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Adding
to this confusing mosaic are the diverse degrees of compliance by the public in each state.
The objective of this study is to investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work
together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of infection. To accomplish this,
we build an epidemiological model that specifically takes into account not only the community
mitigation strategies that slow the spread of the virus, but also compliance1 by the public. This
model is applied to a sample of 6 U.S. states (New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado,
Texas, and Arizona) chosen for three reasons. They have had varying success in flattening the
infection curve; they have the daily data on recoveries that is needed for estimation; they have
the advantage of having a range of positivity ratios2. In view of our estimation results, we offer
some practical policy tools and recommendations to aid public policy.
As of today, while the race for a vaccine proceeds, mitigation actions are the primary bulwark
against COVID-193. These measures can move from the individual level like washing hands,
wearing face masks4, and maintaining physical distance to those imposed by authorities such as
restrictions on gatherings, school and workplace closings etc. The Oxford University Blavatnik
School of Government maintains a website that has created an index to capture such strategies
(Hale, et al., 2020). With data from more than 160 countries including the U.S., it has calculated
a Government Response Stringency Index (GRSI) for each country using 9 indicators of mitigation
such as school closings, restrictions on gatherings and so on (Hale et. al. 2020) See Appendix A
for the individual indicators. This GRSI is scaled from 0 to 100. As of July 31, 2020, the Index for
the U.S. is 69.0 and to give this some context, for Canada it is 67.13, Australia is 68.06, China is

81.94. Very recently, it has also constructed Stringency Indices for each U.S. state (Hale, et al.,
2020B).
The national GRSI has been used by researchers (Jaytilleke et. al. 2020) and has also been used
in a modified version applied to Brazil (Barberia et. 2020). We are building on the methodology
proposed by the Oxford team for the state indices they have created. On examining the
individual elements that go into the state indices calculated by the Oxford index, we realized that
certain changes were needed to construct state indices tailored to U.S. state conditions. By
modifying individual elements we created another set of state-specific Stringency Indices that we
call the Bentley State Stringency Index (BSI). We have therefore built on and extended the
contribution by the Oxford University Martin School.
As the purpose of mitigation measures is to slow down the spread of infection, we introduced an
exponential Mitigation Function on the transmission term in a time-varying SEIRD model. This
Mitigation Function, incorporating the Bentley State Stringency Index (BSI), plays a crucial role in
slowing down the progression of the disease, provided there is compliance. The latter is
represented by an estimable Compliance Indicator (CI) that captures the average degree of
compliance in each state. The Compliance Indicator thus modifies the effect of the BSI. It can
allow the BSI to work at its full potential in reducing infection or it can progressively choke off
completely the effect of mitigation policies as compliance by the public moves to zero. Sheikh
et. al. 2020 outlined some indirect ways in which one may assess the degree of compliance such
as by cell phone GPS data or traffic congestion and public transport usage. Our approach
provides a data-based estimation of the degree of compliance that is state specific. To the best
of our knowledge, our approach of employing a Mitigation Function with a tailored, state specific
Stringency Index and a Compliance Indicator has not been done before.
The estimated Compliance Indicator was then used with varying values of the Stringency Index
to see how the basic reproductive number R05 could be brought to a level less than 16 in each of
the states studied. This provided some answers as to why some states have not been successful
in controlling infections. Our work focuses on the importance of the Mitigation Function with its
two important components: the BSI and the Compliance Indicator. We argue that this, too, can
be a useful metric to be watched by policy makers. We have given the method by which it can
be calculated and shown the value of tracking it to ensure that it is within acceptable limits. This
metric can indicate the minimum level of compliance needed to control the epidemic given a
particular level of stringency. The visual tool that we present also has the advantage of being
easy for the public to understand.

2. DATA, VARIABLES AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Our work is based on multiple data sources. The New York Times repository of coronavirus data
on GitHub and state level data from the various state web portals7 were used. Though these data

sets begin from Jan 1 2020, COVID-19 infections were not apparent during the early period.
March 2 is the earliest date when any observation is available. Beginning from that date, our
data runs through July 31 2020. Additional data on average household size8 and state population
were gathered from the U.S. Department of the Census projections (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020).
We calculated daily cumulative infection (infection cases) from the daily numbers of new
confirmed cases. Similarly, daily cumulative recovery (recovery) and daily cumulative death
(death) were computed from daily numbers of recoveries and confirmed deaths. All three
variables are from the New York Times repository for each state. States may differ on how
recovery is defined. For example, Texas calculated recoveries from those who are hospitalized by
estimating the proportion of those who are hospitalized for no more than 32 days. To this
number they add those who have not been hospitalized but have been infected with Covid-19
for 14 days (State of Texas, 2020). Colorado bases recovery data on those discharged from Covid19-related hospitalization (State of Colorado, 2020). For New Hampshire, recoveries are
estimated from the resolution of Covid-19 fever without the use of fever-reducing medications
and improvements in respiratory symptoms (State of New Hampshire, 2020). No definitions have
been released by New York, Arizona or New Mexico at the time the manuscript was completed.
Due to the uneven quality in the data, there are a few missing daily entries that occur on different
days in each state data across the three different variables that we used: daily new confirmed
cases, daily recovery and daily deaths. Together, they comprise 4% of our 2736 data points.
These missing entries were imputed by taking the average of the previous seven days as it takes
the CDC coders that length of time to record COVID-19 deaths (CDC, 2020); the CDC uses a 7-day
moving average to report new daily cases (Stokes, et al., 2020).
Overview of the six states
According to WHO, to ensure that the testing rate is sufficient, the positivity rate should be
between 3 to 5%. As of August 13th, only NY, NH, NM and CO are within this threshold. Back in
mid-August, AZ had the highest positivity rate of all 50 states (only Puerto Rico has the highest
possible, 100%). The trend of new cases per 100,000 shows a wide disparity in controlling the
infection among these states. As seen from table 1, NY which started out with the highest rate
of 1154.6 per 100,000 people has now the lowest (111.5). On the other hand, Arizona started
with 90 and is now at 1302.4. NM and NH started with very similar rates (144.5 and 167.4
respectively), but by June NM’s rate was almost 2 times of NH’s rate.

*This is obtained by dividing total new cases over the whole month by the state population and then multiplying by 100,000.

In addition, the varying trends of infections and recoveries in each state are shown in Figure 1.
In some states like Texas, AZ and NM, the infection rate has accelerated from a previously slower
rate of increase. However, in each state there is a clear point of inflection that has occurred in
June. On the other hand, the remaining 3 states are entering the phase where the infection is
flattening at different rates. This is most noticeable in NY.

death

Note: To show the three trends with different scales in the same graph, we employed a dual y-axis chart. The left
y-axis indicates infection and recovery while the right y-axis shows cumulative deaths. The blue line represents
cumulative confirmed infections, the green cumulative recovery and the red cumulative deaths.

Investigating this disparity is the question that we have set out to explore in this paper.
The Stringency Index
A Stringency Index was calculated for each state by modifying the Oxford index as shown in
Appendix B. Necessary adjustments had to be made in choosing the individual elements of the
index. Three items that could not be included by us were restrictions that were not applicable at
the State level, or were not applicable to the U.S. in general. These were restrictions on internal
travel controls, international transportation, and public officials commenting or coordinating
campaigns. However, we needed to add three important restrictions applicable to the U.S. that

were not included in the Oxford Index. These were the wearing of face masks 9 , social or physical
distancing of 6 feet10, nursing home visiting restrictions11, and state border restrictions. We
adopted the same methodology as given by the Oxford Martin School (Oxford University Martin
School, 2020) which we explain in Appendix B.
The BSI was calculated for each state for the entire period. What do these numbers mean? The
two extremes of BSI would be 0 and 10. At 0, there are no restrictions. At 10, all the restrictions
given in Table 2 (Appendix A) apply at the maximum of the scales applicable to that category. In
addition, these restrictions are also applied to the entire state. The actual BSI therefore, will be
a combination of the different elements and the scale at which they are applied. For instance,
if face masks are recommended but not required, the level of the variable H6 (see Appendix B)
becomes 1 instead of the maximum of 2 and the BSI will go down. Therefore, a particular BSI
number cannot point to a unique combination of mitigation measures but may be consistent with
different combinations of restrictions whether applied to the entire state or to targeted areas.
To further clarify the significance of the BSI, we illustrate it from our calculations using the actual
state data from New York and Arizona, two states with very different success in controlling their
infection rates. For instance, on the 25 April, the BSI for NY was 6.47 but the next day, 26th April,
the BSI jumped to 7.03 because the testing policy was refined to say that anyone showing COVID19 symptoms should be tested. In Arizona, the BSI on March 30 was 3.75 and the next day it
rose to 4.72. The big jump was due to the introduction of new requirements of staying at home
and limiting public transportation. On April 30, the BSI was 5.0 and the very next day, May 1, it
dropped to 4.4. This is because Arizona removed the restriction and stay at home order ends.
The movement of the BSI for each state is shown in Figure 2. Notice that the 6 states began
mitigation interventions around mid-March but subsequently they diverged in terms of timing
and extent. By April, CO had the highest BSI, whereas AZ had the lowest number. NY slackened
restrictions in June and was slightly below NM, but from mid of April to May, New York had been
more restrictive than NM.

THE MODEL
The model that we adopt is based on the SEIRD (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered or
Died) model that has been developed by Weitz and Dushoff (2015), Loli and Zama (2020) and
Lattanzio and Palumbo (2020). Diagrammatically it can be shown as follows:

Following Lolli and Zama (2020), we have the compartments S, E, I, R and D. S is the susceptible
group, E consists of those who are infected but may not be infectious, I contains the infectious
group, while R and D respectively consist of those who recovered or died.
𝛽: The term 𝛽, though called by slightly different names in the literature is often called the
transmission rate of infection or the rate at which two specific individuals come into effective
contact per unit of time12 (see Keeling and Rohani, 2011 and Vynnycky and White, 2010).
Specifically, 𝛽 is the product of the Contact Rate (average number of contacts per person per
unit of time) * Transmission probability or probability of disease transmission in a contact.
𝛼: The incubation rate, 1/ 𝛼 is the average period (days) of moving from E to I.
𝛾: The recovery rate for those infected and who have recovered. They move from I to R.
𝛿: The death rate of infected patients who die. They move from I to D.
1/(𝛾 + 𝛿): The average infectious period (days) for the infectious group I.
This model assumes that there is no reinfection and so eliminates movement from R to S. In
addition due to the short period under consideration for epidemics, the population is assumed
to be constant with equal birth and death rates.
The SEIRD model has now been modified by explicitly modeling two important drivers of 𝛽. In
the epidemiological literature, it is acknowledged that 𝛽 can depend on factors like age, living
conditions, behavioral interventions such as the closing of theaters, schools, staggering of office
hours as happened during the 1918 pandemic (Vynnycky and White, 2010; Bootsma and
Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et. al., 2007). Thus the standard 𝛽 in the literature is a kind of “black
box” which contains a complex of factors that can affect 𝛽 and the transmission of disease. We
investigate two important factors that influence 𝛽: mitigation policies that the BSI captures, and
the compliance to these by the public. The latter is being increasingly discussed in the media as
being crucial to the success of the various mitigation measures. On Aug 5, in a virtual symposium
hosted by the Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Dr. Fauci, Director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained that it was due to the difference
in the states’ mitigation measures and the different ways in which the public has complied with
these measures that the U.S. is having difficulty in controlling the pandemic13.

To operationalize these two factors that drive 𝛽 we now explicitly formulate a Mitigation
Function that will act to reduce the transmission of disease. This Mitigation Function will have
two major components14: the Bentley Stringency Index (BSI) and what we call the Compliance
Indicator (CI). The BSI has been calculated daily for each state while the Compliance Indicator
will be estimated from our adaptive computing procedure.
By explicitly including the Mitigation Function, we propose the following formula for 𝛽:
𝛽 = 𝛽0 ∙ 1/𝑒 𝑘∙𝑆𝐼∙𝜃
Where, 𝛽0 connotes the transmission without policy intervention, and 𝑒 𝑘∙𝑆𝐼∙𝜃 is defined as the
mitigation function where k is 1/(average household size) and is fixed in our model estimation
for each state, 𝑆𝐼 is the policy stringency index, and 𝜃 is the compliance indicator. 𝛽 will decrease
at an exponential rate of 1/𝑒 𝑘∙𝑆𝐼∙𝜃 .
To incorporate the transmission factor in a time-varying model, we develop a time dependent
parameter 𝛽𝑡 in our model for estimation purposes.
𝛽𝑡 = 𝛽0 ∙ 1/𝑒𝑘∙𝑆𝐼𝑡−ℎ ∙𝜃𝑡
The time-varying Mitigation Function is: 𝑒 𝑘∙𝑆𝐼𝑡−ℎ ∙𝜃𝑡 where, 𝑆𝐼𝑡 is the stringency index at time t.
The time lag introduced by a delay in policy implementation is denoted by h. We assume a
modest policy lag of 1 day in our model using daily data. 𝜃𝑡 is the Compliance Indicator at time
t.
Note that the Compliance Indicator can vary from 0 (no one complies) to a theoretical maximum
of 1 (everyone complies). When the CI =0, the BSI index has no effect irrespective of its value
and the model collapses to the standard model where the mitigation efforts do not affect 𝛽. On
the other hand, the BSI can also vary from 0 (where there are no restrictions) to a theoretical
maximum of 10 (which is akin to a total lockdown). When BSI =0, the model again collapses to
the standard model. When BSI is greater than 0, then the effect on 𝛽 will depend also on the
Compliance Indicator. Even if BSI is at its maximum, a low CI will reduce the Mitigation Function.
In other words, it is both BSI and the Compliance Indicator that will determine (given the
household size that varies by state) the power of the Mitigation Function which affects the
transmission of the disease. Incorporating this, our model structure will be as follows.

METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS
To estimate the parameters of our proposed model, we use numerical analysis methods and
statistical approaches with COVID-19 data from 6 states beginning from Mar 2020 to July 2020.
In this computing process, we first develop the difference equation system as per the following
system:
𝑆(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑆(𝑡) − 𝛽0 ∙ 𝑒 −𝑘∙𝑆𝐼𝑡−1 ∙𝜃𝑡 ∙

𝑆𝑡 ∙ 𝐼𝑡
𝑁

𝐸(𝑡 + 1) = 𝐸(𝑡) + 𝛽0 ∙ 𝑒 −𝑘∙𝑆𝐼𝑡−1 ∙𝜃𝑡 ∙

𝐼(𝑡 + 1) = 𝐼(𝑡) + 𝛼𝐸𝑡 − 𝛾𝐼𝑡 − 𝛿𝐼𝑡
𝑅(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑅(𝑡) + 𝛾𝐼𝑡
𝐷(𝑡 + 1) = 𝐷(𝑡) + 𝛿𝐼𝑡
Then, we develop the overall error function: 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟(𝑡) = max{𝐸𝑟𝑆 (𝑡), 𝐸𝑟𝐼 (𝑡), 𝐸𝑟𝑅 (𝑡), 𝐸𝑟𝐷 (𝑡) },
where 𝐸𝑟𝑆 (𝑡) = |𝑆̂(𝑡) − 𝑆(𝑡)|; 𝐸𝑟𝐼 (𝑡) = |𝐼̂(𝑡) − 𝐼(𝑡)|; 𝐸𝑟𝑅 (𝑡) = |𝑅̂ (𝑡) − 𝑅(𝑡)|; and finally,
̂ (𝑡) − 𝐷(𝑡)|.
𝐸𝑟𝐷 (𝑡) = |𝐷
As is commonly used, we take the absolute difference between 𝑆̂(𝑡) and 𝑆(𝑡) to denote the error
𝐸𝑟𝑆 (𝑡) at time t. We use a similar process to define the errors for Infection (𝐸𝑟𝐼 (𝑡)), recovery
(𝐸𝑟𝑅 (𝑡)) and death (𝐸𝑟𝐷 (𝑡)) at time t.
̂ (𝑡) are the model estimations at time t for susceptible cases, confirmed
𝑆̂(𝑡), 𝐼̂(𝑡), 𝑅̂ (𝑡), 𝐷
infections, recovered individuals and those who died. Correspondingly, 𝑆(𝑡), 𝐼(𝑡), 𝑅(𝑡), 𝐷(𝑡) are
the observed data for each compartment at time t. To find the estimated values of the
parameters at time t which give the minimum of 𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟(𝑡), we applied the interior-point
algorithms with dynamically modified constraints on the parameter estimations.
MATLAB 2020a was used for the computation. With the numerical estimation of the parameters,
̂ in all six states.
the 4th order Rouge-Kouta method was used for predictions on 𝑆̂, 𝐼̂, 𝑅̂ , 𝐷
The model provides insights into the relationship between three crucial factors in controlling an
epidemic: the Bentley Stringency Index (embodying the policy measures recommended or
required by Federal or State authorities), the Compliance Indicator (embodying the extent of
compliance by the public to these policy measures) and 𝑅0 15 (the basic reproduction number).

With the estimated parameters, our next step explores the interaction of the time-varying values
of the Stringency Index as well as the Compliance Index in each state with the movement of the
infection rates.
To examine this, we did two sets of simulations to explore interacting effect of BSI and
compliance rate on 𝑅0 . Both simulations are based on the formula above, with fixed parameters
of average household size (2.6 US average in 2019), 𝛾 and 𝛿 (from US data). 𝛽0 in this simulation
is estimated from CDC’s report as of Aug 13th (CDC, 2020) .

Simulation 1. Comparing the Oxford and Bentley Stringency Indices
Using our model, we calculated the movement of 𝑅0 using both the Bentley and the Oxford
indices. In our model, the basic reproduction number

𝑅0 =

𝛽
1
1
= 𝛽0 ∙ 𝑘∙𝑆𝐼∙𝜃 ∙
𝛾+𝛿
𝛾+𝛿
𝑒

For an epidemic to die out, 𝑅0 must be less than one.
We ran the comparative simulations with fixed parameters, including the Compliance Indicator
on all 6 states. The results (Figure 4) are reported for New York and Texas 16. In this simulation,
we assumed the CI to be a fixed value 0.5 for both states (Corona Board, 2020); average house
hold size as 2.6; 𝛾 as 0.52 and 𝛿 as 0.03. Comparing the two Stringency Indices, the Bentley
Stringency Index is overwhelmingly (with a few exceptions) more conservative in that the
simulated 𝑅0 is higher than that obtained by using the Oxford Index.
FIGURE 4: Comparison of Oxford Stringency Index (OSI) and Bentley Stringency Index (BSI)

These simulations gave us further confidence about using the Bentley Stringency Index. Recall
that the BSI was constructed specifically for each state using the various components as
described. In taking individual states separately, we were able to start with the first statewide
announcement regarding mitigation measures (State of Texas, 2020) (State of New York, 2020).

Simulation 2: Interaction of Compliance Indicator and 𝑹𝟎 at different levels of BSI

Based on 𝑅0 = 𝛽0 ∙ 𝑘∙𝑆𝐼∙𝜃 ∙
, we simulated the Compliance Indicator and 𝑅0 at different
𝑒
𝛾+𝛿
levels of the BSI, assuming a recovery rate 𝛾 of 0.52 based on the U.S. average and an average
household size of 2.6 (United Nations, 2019; Corona Board, 2020). See Figure 5.
Figure 5: The Combination of Stringency and Compliance needed at various
levels of R0

In Figure 5, the vertical axis is 𝑅0 while the horizontal axis shows the range of the Compliance
Indicator. Each colored line shows the relationship between 𝑅0 and the Compliance Indicator
at different levels of the Stringency Index (The highest level of Stringency is 10 and is shown by
the lowest line). The horizontal line denotes 𝑅0 =1 which is accepted in the literature as the
threshold above which the epidemic will keep spreading. When 𝑅0 is less than one (the lower
part of the graph can be denoted as “desirable” and the upper portion as “undesirable”) then the
epidemic will die out.
Our simulations show the different levels of compliance that would be compatible with different
degrees of stringency in order for 𝑅0 to go below the threshold. For instance, when the BSI is at
1, then notice that even if the Compliance Indicator is at the maximum, 𝑅0 will not be lower than
one. On the other hand, with the highest value of the BSI, the Compliance Indicator has to be at
least 25% for 𝑅0 to be at the threshold.

Since the above figure is based on the average household size in the U.S., it must be remembered
that when the household number increases, then to reach the same 𝑅0 , the combination of the
Stringency Index and the Compliance Indicator has to be at higher levels.
New York state began in the “undesirable” portion as the higher red dot indicates. That was
during Day 65 (Mar 5th) to Day 75 (Mar 15th). However, between Day 120 (April 29th) to Day 130
(May 9th), New York moved to the “desirable” portion of the graph as the lower red dot shows.
Similarly, Texas (blue dot) also moved from an undesirable point between Day 170 (June 18th) to
Day 180 (June 28th) to the lower portion during the period Day 190 (July 8th) to Day 200 (July 18).
We will be taking up these periods in more detail below.
This figure can be of use to guide policy regarding the extent of mitigation measures and
compliance needed by the public. Let us illustrate what we mean by going back to the two states
we showed in Figure 5, namely New York and Texas. These two states have had very different
success in combating COVID-19. In Figures 6a and 6b we show plots of the estimated mitigation
function against daily infections.
Figure 6a New York: Plots of mitigation function estimation (daily) vs daily infections (7-day
average)

In Figure 6a for New York, the inverse relation between the Mitigation Function (blue line)
and daily infections (red line) can be clearly seen. It must be remembered that the Mitigation
Function only captures a portion of all the factors that drive 𝛽, the transmission rate. When the

infection was raging, the Mitigation Function was increasing and we find that the BSI increased
from, essentially, 0 to 0.8 with a mean value of 0.358 during the 10-day period Mar 5th to Mar
15th (Days 65 to 75). This was because New York recommended against nursing home visits,
restricted public gatherings and cancelled public events. The mean estimated CI was 46%. This
placed New York in the upper “undesirable” portion of the graph in Figure 5. When the state
initiated the face mask requirement around April 15th (Day 106) and the testing policy was
introduced and defined on April 26 Day 117), infections which had hit a peak began a trajectory
downwards until it plateaued around mid-June. By the beginning of May the infection had
abated and the mean values of BSI and CI were 7.028 and 67% respectively during the 10-day
period between April 29th and May 9th. This trend corresponded with the announcement of
New York’s COVID-19 Testing Policy. With this combination of BSI and Compliance Index, New
York moved to the lower “desirable” range (Figure 5) as the infection rate came under control.
Figure 6b Texas: Plots of mitigation function estimation (daily) vs daily infections (7-day
average)

For Texas, on June 3rd (day 155 in the figure) Governor Abbott signed an executive order on Phase
III reopening, to allow more businesses to reopen and to reduce restrictions on gatherings. The
Mitigation function decreased accordingly. Note in Figure 6b that as the Mitigation Function
decreased with the relaxation of state restrictions, Covid-19 infections also began to climb.

Further, between Day 170 (June 18th) to Day 180 (June 28th), the BSI increased from 3.9 to 5.0
with a mean value of 4.5. The mean value of the estimated CI is 31%. Even though the state had
increased the mitigation policies, it was not enough. The fact that the compliance also is far too
low can be seen with a little thought experiment using Figure 5. Suppose the BSI were 5 (more
stringent), then the compliance indicator would need to be at least 50% for the infection to die
out as Texas moves to the desirable upper portion of the graph. On the other hand, with this
low level of compliance, it can be confidently predicted that the infection will rise. In fact, in the
following weeks between June 22 and July 17 the confirmed COVID-19 cases reached 14,916, the
highest one-day mark for Texas.
Our results also indicate that when stringency measures are constant, changes in the Compliance
Indicator is associated with changes in the infection rates. In Texas, from June 4 th to June 21st
(Day 156 to 173 since Jan 1st), the BSI stayed constant at 3.96. On the other hand, the estimated
CI showed a dramatic 5-day average drop from approximately 88% to 39%. On June 4, Texas
reduced restrictions on gatherings by allowing for indoor assemblies such as at places of worship,
among local government operations, child care services and recreational sports for youths and
adults. The daily infections during the corresponding period also jumped from 1649 to 4430.
This is clearly visible in Figure 6b.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The objective of this paper was to examine how mitigation policies and compliance to these
polices can combine to advance or frustrate the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
concern arose due to states with similar community mitigation measures having very divergent
trends in infection rates. To the best of our knowledge, there is no epidemiological model that
would help us understand this phenomenon. In this paper we propose a simple modification to
bring both mitigation policies and compliance into a standard epidemiological model and, in
exploring their interaction, understand what would be the minimum levels of each that would
lead each state to a point where the epidemic would die out.
To accomplish our purpose, we use a SEIRD model incorporating both mitigation measures and
public compliance that are present in the “black box” that is 𝛽. In doing this, we build upon the
work of Kurcharski et. al. 2020 where they suggest that a combination of methods (testing,
tracing, physical distancing, self-isolation and quarantine) may to needed to reduce effective
transmission so that the epidemic is contained. We go further by taking a vector of mitigation
policy measures and encapsulating them into a Bentley Stringency Index (BSI) similar to that built
by Oxford. We use their methodology and thus build on and extend their work. Tailoring our
state stringency indices by incorporating directives like wearing face masks, restrictions on
nursing home visits that are appropriate to U.S. states, we contribute to the literature.

The best of mitigation measures need to be actually followed if they are to be successful. To
capture public compliance, a state-specific Compliance Indicator was estimated from the model
using the daily COVID-19 data from each state. In this context, Cano et.al 2020 have modelled
scenarios with different levels of what they have termed social distancing. However this term is
also used interchangeably with lockdown. They show that the less seriously the public takes the
lockdown measures, the longer the epidemic will take to resolve and the number of deaths will
increase. By quantifying public compliance through the Compliance Indicator, we build the
Mitigation Function that encompasses both the BSI and the CI. We demonstrate the association
of the movement of infections with movements in the Mitigation Function, ceteris-paribus.
Thus, it is the combined effect of the mitigation measures and the compliance that is key.
Without either, there can be no containing the epidemic.
Compliance by the public to mitigation measures is largely exogenous in democratic societies.
However, by coordinated and effective public information campaigns, through example, by
helping people understand that obeying these restrictions is crucial to reclaiming their lives,
compliance may be enhanced. In this regard, Arriola and Grossman’s work, though in the
context of Africa, may be interesting (Arriola & Grossman, 2020). They wanted to see how the
social identity of individuals could affect their compliance with advice from public health officials.
In the U.S., some states have adopted the “stick” approach; California is cutting off power to
those who are defying restrictions (Treisman, 2020). However, if the public understands that it
is in their own self-interest, the degree of compliance can be increased with their cooperation.
We have also contributed by suggesting a practical, real-time, visual policy tool that can be used
flexibly not only to monitor the progress in controlling the disease but also to adjust policy in a
dynamic fashion. It can be used to support decisions in adjusting mitigation policies by taking
into consideration the level of public compliance as well. This tool is also simple enough to be
used to educate the public on the importance of compliance.
The chief limitation of our analysis is a problem that all researchers on COVID-19 have to contend
with at this time with an ongoing deadly and fast-moving pandemic. Even though we had only
4% of our observation points that were missing or questionable, there are concerns regarding
the overall quality of the data (General Accounting Office, 2020 ).
Our work has opened up several avenues of future research. Our method of using the Mitigation
Function in SEIRD can be applied to other epidemiological models as well. In addition, this
methodology can also be translated to other countries, thereby providing another tool to the
authorities in combating this epidemic. We have also made the first step in attempting to
quantify the factors that go into “black box” of 𝛽 and hope that our work will stimulate further
exploration.

ENDNOTES

The importance of full compliance, though generally acknowledged, can be seen in the control of the Ebola outbreak (Do &
Lee, 2016) where even a day’s delay in full compliance could double the number of infections.
2

The positivity rates as on August 16,2020 are: New York (0.83); New Hampshire (1.34), New Mexico (2.59),
Colorado (3.83), Texas (15.32) and Arizona (10.79).
3

(Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, & Hollingsworth, 2020) discuss the importance of various country-wide
mitigation measures. (Kucharski, et al., 2020) investigate the effect of isolation, contact tracing, testing and
physical distancing on reducing transmission. See also (Hellewell, et al., 2020) and (Prem, et al., 2020). (Hatchett,
Mecher, & Lipsitch, 2007) and (Bootsma & Ferguson, 2007) inform us on public health intervention measures
during the 1918 pandemic to give us a historical context.
4

(Teslya, et al., 2020) showed the importance of mask wearing and hand washing in conjunction with social
distancing. Mask wearing and handwashing are two measures entirely within the control of the individual,
whereas other measures may need the cooperation of others. However, individuals may also decide not to
comply with these measures and that is why our compliance index is so important.

As explained by (Chowell & Nishiura, 2008) a fundamental result in epidemiology is the “threshold” value of the
basic reproduction number Ro: “ There is a difference in epidemic behavior when the average number of
secondary infections caused by an average infective during his/her period of infectiousness, called the basic
reproduction number, is less than one and when this quantity exceeds one”.

(Nande, Adlam, Sheen, Levy, & Hill, 2020) found that within-household transmission was an important element
for success in controlling the infection. In this context, see also (Li, et al., 2020). (Emeruwa, et al., 2020) in a study
of nearly 400 pregnant women in New York City did not find an association between infection and population
density but did find a higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to increased household crowding.
9

(Stutt, Retkute, Bradley, Gilligan, & Colvin, 2020) showed the effectiveness of wearing face masks in managing
the Covid-19 pandemic.
10

(CDC, 2020) Some are advocating the term “physical distancing” to clarify the difference between physical and
social distancing where social connectivity is to be encouraged while yet maintaining physical distancing. See
(Allen, Ling, & Burton, 2020)
11

As per CDC guidelines (CDC, 2020)

12

it is important to clarify that we are talking of a frequency-dependent transmission in that the number of
contacts does not depend on population size. See (Keeling & Rohani, 2011).

In the words of the Harvard Gazette, “In addition, he (Dr. Fauci) said, state reopening plans proceeded at
different paces. Some states reopened slowly, similar to the pace of European nations, while others went much
faster. Another variable, he said, was the extent to which residents of different states adhered to reopening
guidelines, with some following recommendations while others ignored the restrictions, sometimes in notably
large groups”. (Powell, 2020)

The third component is household size that we will be taking as constant over the period under consideration.

Ro is the basic reproductive rate and is defined in the literature as the average number of people an infectious
person will infect assuming that the rest of the population is susceptible.

Appendix B
Creation of new items in the Bentley modification of the Oxford Stringency Index.
Our state stringency index (SI) is compiled from 12 items. The Oxford state SI is based on 13 items (Hale,
et al., 2020; Hale, et al., 2020B). We modified the Oxford state stringency index by dropping five items
and adding four. We dropped item C7 (restriction on internal movement through public transportation)
because this policy was already included in item C5 (closing of public transportation). We also dropped
C8 (internal travel controls through screening or quarantine from high risk regions) because we were not
aware of states closing borders entirely or banning the entry of individuals from high risk regions. Even
Rhode Island’s attempt to target cars with New York state license plates in order to impose a 14 day
quarantine on visitors from New York was rescinded (Moroney, 2020). We also set aside items E1
(income support for those who lose their jobs), E2 (debt/contract relief for households) and H1 (public
official commenting or coordinating public information campaigns about Covid-19) because we felt they
did not pertain to containment or closure. We added a total of four items to the stringency index. These
items pertain to states imposing a mandatory self-quarantine on visitors from other states (C9), limiting
nursing home visitation (C10), recommending a social distancing practice in public of at least six feet
(C11) and policy on face mask covers (H6).
The daily stringency index score is tabulated as an average of 12 sub-indices drawn from the
containment and closure and health systems items in the Oxford inventory scaled from 0 to 100.
Additional weight is given to 10 of the 12 policy items that could potentially be implemented statewide.
Because the four items we created (see Appendix A Table) resulted in two more items than the original
Oxford SI that could be implemented statewide, we modified the weight on which the final stringency
index score is based. This is done by weighing the Likert scale points of the 10 indicators that are
designated for statewide or targeted implementation using the formula outlined by the Oxford group.

Our weight of 0.30 was very close to the ones calculated by Oxford (0.29), based on eight items, for use
in the original index. The weights are then employed to create sub-indices of those items scaled to 100
in the same manner indicated from Oxford.

For the two items without statewide implementation as an option, sub-indices were calculated simply as
a scaled function of 100 multiplied by the ratio of the raw scores to their maximum point value.

The final Stringency Index score is then an average of the all sub-indices.
