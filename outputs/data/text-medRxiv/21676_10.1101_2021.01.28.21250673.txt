Title: Is vitamin D deficiency associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe?
Authors: Dimitra Rafailia Bakaloudi, Michail Chourdakis
ID: MEDRXIV/2021/250673

The authors have withdrawn this manuscript because, following comments received
during the review process, they have updated the number of countries included in
their study (and also changed from 5 to 10 years the limit for Vit-D information
studies that they included), which led to non-significant correlations between
mortality and infections and Vit D deficiency prevalence. Therefore, the authors do
not wish this work to be cited as reference for the project. If you have any questions,
please contact the corresponding author.
