Abstract

23

Background

24

Clinical spectrum of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear, especially with

25

regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to describe the clinical course and final

26

outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the full spectrum of

27

disease severity. We also aimed to identify potential predictive factors for COVID-19

28

pneumonia.

29

Methods and findings

30

We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with laboratory-confirmed

31

COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand,

32

between January 8 and April 16, 2020. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included.

33

The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. More than half

34

(56%) of the patients were mild disease severity, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and

35

3% were critical. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The final clinical outcomes in

36

189 (97.9%) were recovered and 4 (2.1%) were deceased. The incidence of pneumonia was

37

39%. In multivariable logistic regression, increasing age (OR 2.55 per 10-year increase from

38

30 years old; 95% CI, 1.67-3.90; p<0.001), obesity (OR 8.74; 95%CI, 2.06-37.18; p=0.003),

39

and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.59 per 1°C increase from 37.2 °C; 95% CI,

40

2.30-9.17; p<0.001) were potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia.

41

Conclusion

42

Across the spectrum of disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in our cohort had

43

good final clinical outcomes. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of them. Older

Author summary

48

This report describes the clinical course and final clinical outcomes of the full spectrum of

49

disease severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluates risk factors of

50

pneumonia in 193 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Bamrasnaradura

51

Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand. The majority of patients with COVID-19 had mild

52

disease. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in approximately 40% of patients. Older age,

53

obesity, and higher grade of fever at presentation were independent risk factors of pneumonia

54

in adult patients with COVID-19. Most patients in our cohort recovered and were discharged

55

from hospital (recovery rate, 98%). Our findings can help the public health systems to

56

estimate the burden of the disease and identify vulnerable patients in a timely manner.

57

Introduction

58

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the most recent emerging infectious disease, and it

59

is caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1].

60

COVID-19 was first identified in China in December 2019 [2], and has become a global

61

menace with a great impact on the health systems of affected countries. Several studies have

62

described the demographic and clinical characteristics, disease severity, and treatment

63

outcomes of patients with COVID-19 [3-8]. These reports focused on the findings of patients

64

with moderate and severe diseases and most of the disease severity assessments were based

65

on evaluation at the time of admission, which were likely for triage purpose. The temporal

66

clinical progression during hospitalization was well documented [9, 10], disease severity at

67

admission can change during hospital stay and can also differ from that at discharge. Also,

68

the final clinical outcomes defined as recovered or deceased in the published reports could

69

not be fully established due to the fact that a number of the patients were still hospitalized at

70

the time of data analysis [3-6, 11, 12]. Thus, a complete picture and the final clinical

71

outcome, especially the rate of recovery, of patients with COVID-19 are still uncertain.

72

COVID-19 has been categorized into a range of clinical severity including,

73

asymptomatic, mild, moderate (non-severe pneumonia), severe (severe pneumonia), and

74

critical illness [13, 14]. Data from a large cohort from China showed 81% of patients had a

75

mild disease while 14% were severe and 5% developed critical illness [15]. Nevertheless,

76

patients defined as ‘mild’ in the Chinese nationwide survey varied from having minimal

77

symptoms without lung involvement to having early pneumonia. Data on COVID-19 patients

78

with both mild disease and mild pneumonia are lacking. Cases defined as ‘non-severe’ were

79

excluded in a recent randomized controlled trial on favipiravir [16]. The incidence and risk

80

factors of pneumonia of any severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are also unknown.

81

Understanding the full spectrum of COVID-19, rather than only the more severe end of the

82

disease, would facilitate public health systems to estimate the burden of the disease and to

83

identify vulnerable patients earlier.

84

On January 13, 2020, Thailand reported a confirmed case of COVID-19, the first

85

recorded case outside of China [17]. This case was admitted to the Bamrasnaradura

86

Infectious Diseases (BIDI), which the Thai Ministry of Public Health designated as the

87

national infectious disease referral hospital for the COVID-19 outbreak. As of May 29, 2020,

88

3,076 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Thailand [18].

disease. We described the clinical course and final outcome (recovered or deceased) of the

92

disease. Potential predictive factors of COVID-19 pneumonia were also investigated.

94

Patients

95

BIDI is the main public health institution under the Department of Disease Control, Ministry

96

of Public Health of Thailand responsible for testing and treating emerging infectious diseases

97

including COVID-19. All individuals who were diagnosed as COVID-19, according to the

98

WHO interim guidance [13] were admitted at the institute, regardless of the severity of their

99

disease. BIDI’s protocol requires nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples to be obtained to

100

test for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-

101

PCR) assay at two-day intervals during hospitalization, until two consecutive negative results

102

at least 24 hours apart were achieved. Baseline chest radiograph was performed in every

103

patient at admission. The need for follow-up chest radiograph during admission was based on

104

the judgement of each attending physicians. The patients were discharged if they met the

105

following criteria: 1) resolution of fever without the use of antipyretics ≥ 48 hours, 2)

106

improvement in respiratory symptoms with oxygen saturation ≥ 95% while they were

107

breathing ambient air, and 3) samples from nasopharyngeal and throat swab tested negative

108

for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among

109

all adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were

110

hospitalized at BIDI, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. The hospital outcomes were

111

monitored until discharges or death. The study was reviewed and approved by the BIDI’s

112

Institutional Review Board (S012h_63_ExPD).

114

A laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was defined as detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in

115

nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens by RT-PCR assay. Fever was defined as an

116

axillary temperature of ≥ 37.3°C. Defervescence was defined as resolution of fever (axillary

117

temperature < 37.3°C) without the use of fever-reducing medications. Pneumonia was

118

diagnosed by the presence of respiratory symptoms and opacity on chest radiography.

119

Pneumonia with detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory specimens was considered

120

as COVID 19-associated pneumonia. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was

121

determined according to the Berlin definition [19]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined

122

according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline [20]. Obesity

123

was classified as body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2 according to World Health Organization

124

(WHO) classification for overweight and obesity [21]

125

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2

126

Respiratory specimens were collected from the nasopharynx and oropharynx using synthetic

127

fiber or flocked swabs. The swabs from both sites were placed in the same tube to increase

128

viral detection. Samples were transported in a viral transport medium containing anti-fungal

129

and antibiotic supplements were used. Sputum specimens were collected from patients with

130

lower respiratory symptoms.

131

Total nucleic acid or viral RNA was extracted from the specimens and tested with

132

conventional nested RT-PCR for coronavirus family of the first two novel coronavirus cases

133

in Thailand. Both cases were confirmed as Wuhan human novel coronavirus 2019 by two

134

reference laboratories—the Thailand National Institute of Health, Ministry of Public Health

135

and Emerging Infectious Disease Health Sciences Center, King Chulalongkorn Memorial

136

138

human novel coronavirus 2019 sequence data were available, real-time RT-PCR with SARS-

139

CoV-2-specific primers and probes were developed to detect the specific gene areas using the

140

WHO protocol. Real-time RT-PCR testing was based on fluorescent PCR and probes consist

141

of a reporter dye and quencher dye. The PCR instrument was automatically amplified and

142

detect the fluorescent signal. To avoid contamination, non-template or negative controls were

143

included in every PCR run. Human housekeeping gene was used as an internal control to

144

monitor the process of specimen collection and extraction. To confirm COVID-19 infection

145

at the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in January and February 2020, SARS-CoV-2

146

RNA had to be detected by two independent laboratories.

147

At BIDI, we used two real-time RT-PCR techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2. First, the

148

COVID-19 Coronavirus Real Time PCR Kit (Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co.,Ltd.;

149

WHO Product Code JC10223-1NW-25T or JC10223-1NW-25T) was used for detecting the

150

Open Reading Frame gene region (ORF 1ab) and viral nucleocapsid region (N gene)

151

according to the recommendation of the Chinese CDC . Second, the Real-Time Fluorescence

152

Detection RT-PCR kit (BGI technology) was concurrently used for detecting the ORF 1ab

153

gene. After March 31, 2020, Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 qualitative assay for use on the Cobas®

154

6800/8800 Systems (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) was used at BIDI. Both ORF 1ab and E

155

gene were designed for SARS-CoV-2 detection according to WHO recommendation.

156

Data collection

157

Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, hospital courses, investigation, and treatment data of

158

all consecutive laboratory-confirmed cases were extracted from medical records reviewed by

159

four attending physicians responsible for the patients with COVID-19 at BIDI. Chest

by a pulmonologist during the data extraction. The severity of illness of each patient was

162

evaluated at the time of discharge or death by the study team.

163

Clinical outcomes

164

The patients who met the discharged criteria were defined as recovered. All laboratory-

165

confirmed cases who died during hospitalization regardless of any negative follow-up RT-

166

PCR results defined as deceased. The severity of illness of each patient was classified

167

following the report of the WHO-China Joint mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 [22]:

168

mild (the clinical symptoms were mild, and there was no sign of pneumonia on imaging),

169

moderate (fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological findings of pneumonia, but

170

without features of severe pneumonia), severe (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute, oxygen

171

saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within

172

24-48 hours), and critical (respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ failure).

173

Asymptomatic infection was defined as when patients had no symptoms or signs throughout

174

the course of the disease. Patients were categorized into two groups based on pneumonia

175

detection (pneumonia vs non-pneumonia).

176

Statistics

177

Descriptive data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), median and interquartile

178

range (IQR), and frequencies (%), as appropriate. No imputation was made for missing data.

179

The mean values of continuous variables with normal distribution between the pneumonia

180

and non-pneumonia groups were compared using Student’s t-test. Categorical variables

181

between the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups were compared using the Chi-squared

182

test and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine

183

factors associated with pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. We excluded variables from

184

the logistic model if their nature was highly subjective (presenting symptoms that were

186

results), or if they were correlated with pneumonia (e.g. high respiratory rate and low oxygen

187

saturation). Variables with p-value < 0.05 on univariate analysis were included in the

188

multiple logistic regression model. Collinearity diagnostics were performed for the

189

multivariable logistic regression analysis. A correlation of > 0.5 was considered risk of bias

190

estimation due to collinearity. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version

194

Patients’ characteristics

195

A total of 195 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were admitted to BIDI

196

during the study period. This included 11 patients previously reported during the early phase

197

of COVID-19 outbreak [23]. Of the 195 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected

198

patients, 193 (99.0%) had either a recovered or deceased final clinical outcome. The other

199

two patients were referred to other hospitals before viral RNA clearance according to their

200

requests to be referred. Two consecutive negative RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal and

201

throat swab were obtained in 82.4% and single negative results in 17.6%. The median (IQR)

202

age of the patients was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, 58.5 % were males, and 91.2% were Thai. The

203

median BMI (IQR) was 23.3 (20.4-25.9) kg/m2 and 12.7% were obese. One-quarter of the

204

patients had one or more coexisting medical conditions, which was found less frequently in

205

mild cases. Hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were the most common comorbidities.

206

Of all cases, 79.3% were local transmission, and 20.7% were imported cases. The

207

epidemiological data showed that 34.7% had a history of contact with a confirmed COVID-

208

19 case, 20.7% had arrived from affected countries with widespread or ongoing transmission

216

Contact investigation was able to identify the date of disease contact in 83 (43.0%) patients.

217

Among this group, the median (IQR) incubation period among this group was 5.5 (3.0-8.0)

218

days. The median (IQR) time from onset of illness to the first visit was 3.0 (2.0-6.0) days.

219

Baseline clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. Fever (62.7%) was the

220

most common presenting symptoms, followed by dry cough (49.2%). Coryza, including

221

rhinorrhea and sore throat, were reported in 28% of cases. Gastrointestinal symptoms were

222

initially present in less than 10% of the patients. At presentation, only 78 (39.8%) of patients

223

were found to have a fever by a thermometer measurement. The mean axillary temperature of

224

mild cases was 37.0 °C, whereas those of moderate and severe cases were more than 37.5 °C.

225

The patients with moderate and severe disease had laboratory abnormalities of greater

226

magnitude (e.g. lower absolute lymphocyte and platelet count). Rapid influenza diagnosis test

227

was done in 141 (73.0%) patients; only one patient tested positive for influenza A. Chest

228

radiography revealed no opacity in 80.8%, unilateral opacity in 8.8%, and bilateral opacities

229

in 10.4% of the patients.

230

During hospitalization

231

The median (IQR) time from onset of illness to hospitalization was 5.0 (3.0-7.0) days. The

232

median frequency of chest radiograph performed during admission was 3.0 (2.0-5.0). Follow-

233

up chest radiograph was done in 155 (80.3%) of the patients. Pneumonia was detected in 75

234

(38.9%) of the patients, of which 49.3% were upon admission and 50.7% were during

235

hospitalization. Among 38 patients who progressed to have pneumonia after admission,

236

diagnostic work up to rule out hospital-acquired pneumonia was performed. Only one patient

237

had Hemophilus parainfluenzae detected from sputum culture which was considered as co-

238

infection. Among the 75 cases with pneumonia, 34.7% were unilateral, and 65.3% were

239

bilateral. The median (IQR) time from onset of illness to pneumonia detection was 7.0 (5.0-

240

9.0) days. Fever was present in only 49.2% of all cases but was detected in 88% of patients

241

with pneumonia. Among febrile patients, non-pneumonia (mild) cases had a lower mean of

242

highest temperature during hospitalization than of those who had pneumonia (37.9 vs 38.8

243

°C). Of 121 patients who reported having had subjective fever prior to admission, 44 (36.4%)

244

had no fever for the entire length of hospital stay. Of 72 patients who reported no fever prior

245

to admission, 18 (25.0%) developed a fever during hospitalization. The median duration from

246

admission to defervescence was 5.0 (3.0-9.0) days. The median duration from admission to

247

defervescence in mild cases was the shortest (3.0 days) compared to higher severity disease

categories (Table 2). Seventy-four patients (38.3%) received supportive treatment while

249

61.7% also received therapeutic options listed in the Thai treatment guideline for cases of

250

COVID-19 infection (Table 2). Thirty-two patients (16.6%) were transferred to the intensive

251

care unit (ICU). The median (IQR) duration from illness onset to ICU admission was 8.0

252

(5.3-10.0) days. Oxygen saturation of < 95% was found in 18.1% of cases whereas 13.0%

253

experienced a respiratory rate of ≥ 24 breaths/min, which only occurred in the pneumonia

254

group. The median duration (IQR) from symptom onset to oxygen saturation < 95% and

255

respiratory rate ≥ 24 breaths/min were 8.0 (7.0-9.0) and 9.0 (6.0-11.0) days, respectively.

256

Supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask was administered in 18.7%, high-flow

257

oxygen in 4.7% and mechanical ventilation in 2.6% of all the patients. The median duration

258

(IQR) from illness onset to intubation was 9.0 (7.0-12.5) days. The median (IQR) duration of

259

oxygen therapy was 5.0 (2.5-11.0) days. More than two weeks of oxygen therapy was

260

required in critical cases. Moderate to severe ARDS was found in 3.1% whereas 3.6% of the

261

patients developed AKI. The median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 12.0 (7.5-19.0) days.

262

The median duration of viral RNA shedding after the onset of symptom was 16.0 (11.0-24.0)

263

days. Severe cases had a longer viral shedding duration than the non-severe cases (Table 2).

264

The longest observed duration of viral shedding was 45 days.

Final clinical outcomes and factors associated with pneumonia

269

Of all cases, 189 (97.9%) were recovered and discharged whereas 4 (2.1%) were deceased.

270

The degree of disease severity was classified as asymptomatic in 5.2%, mild in 55.9%,

271

moderate (non-severe pneumonia) in 22.3%, severe (severe pneumonia) in 13.5%, and

272

critical in 3.1% (Fig 1). According to the Chinese CDC definition [15], 83.4% of the patients

273

were considered mild, 13.5% were severe, and 3.1% were critical. The median time (IQR)

274

from the onset of illness to death was 30.0 (18.0-49.5) days.

Table 3 demonstrates that patients with pneumonia were older (p<0.001), more likely

278

to be male (p=0.001), more likely to be obese (p=0.001), and were different in many

279

presenting symptoms (p<0.05) than those without pneumonia. Cases with pneumonia also

280

had more comorbidities (p<0.001), higher body temperature (p<0.001), and lower oxygen

281

saturation at presentation (p<0.001) than the non-pneumonia cases. Patients without

282

pneumonia more frequently complained of a runny nose (p=0.022) and sore throat (p=0.003)

283

than those with pneumonia. Cases with pneumonia also had a higher proportion of febrile

284

illness during hospitalization (p<0.001), longer duration from admission to defervescence

285

(p<0.001), longer hospital stay (p<0.001), and longer viral shedding duration (p<0.001) than

286

patients without pneumonia.

Discussion

297

We describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of 193 COVID-19 patients admitted at a

298

national infectious institute in Thailand. More than half of the patients had a mild disease

299

severity and the recovery rate of our cohort was 97.9% with a case fatality rate of 2.1%—

300

only four deaths were observed in six critical patients. The overall incidence of pneumonia

301

was 38.9%, of which 57.3% were not severe. Increasing age, obesity, and higher body

302

temperature were potential predictive factors for pneumonia in SARS-CoV-2 infected

303

patients.

304

Our cohort included laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized regardless

305

of their disease severity. Findings from our study could be representative of the patients in the

306

full spectrum of the disease from the first presentation through to the final clinical outcomes.

307

A wide range of mortality of COVID-19 patients from 0 to 28% has been reported in

308

previous studies [3-5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 24], which may have resulted from selection bias of either

309

mild disease status or severe disease status along with a short observation period.

310

In the present study, approximately 40% of patients with SARS-CoV2 infection

311

developed pneumonia. This was much lower than incidence of pneumonia from SARS-CoV-

312

1 (78-90%) [25, 26]. We also found bilateral pneumonia was more prevalent than unilateral

313

pneumonia, which was different from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [27].

314

Older age is widely recognized to be associated with worse pneumonia [11, 28-30]. However,

315

obesity has been less explored so far. Obesity can impair immune responses to viral infection

316

[31, 32]. Kass, et al. found younger individuals with COVID-19 admitted to hospital were

317

more likely to be obese [33]. Chen, et al. reported those with obesity were more likely to

318

have severe condition [30]. We identified obesity was significantly associated with COVID-

319

19 pneumonia.

320

We found that fever was not a hallmark of COVID-19 but fever on admission was

321

significantly associated with pneumonia in the multivariate analysis. Although fever was the

322

most common presenting symptom, presenting fever on admission was less common in

323

patients with mild disease than those with moderate to severe disease. Among cases with

324

mild severity, only 29 (48.3%) of 60 cases who reported fever had a fever during

325

hospitalization. With a median duration from illness onset to the admission of five days, half

326

of the febrile patients with mild COVID-19 might have had a fever for less than five days.

327

Furthermore, we observed that patients with mild disease more frequently had sore throat and

328

rhinorrhea compared with those who were moderate to severe disease severities. These may

329

indicate that the virus is limited to the upper respiratory tract in patients with mild disease. Of

330

note, some patients with mild disease had advanced age and obesity.

331

Few studies have reported on the proportion of asymptomatic infection. Our study

332

revealed 13 patients who were asymptomatic at presentation, but three of them subsequently

333

developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic. Hence, the asymptomatic

334

infection was estimated to be 5% in our cohort, which differs from the previously published

335

reports in other settings (17.9-42.3%) [34, 35]. More information on the actual incidence of

asymptomatic infection among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is needed. Interestingly, 30%

337

of asymptomatic cases in our cohort were more than 50 years of age. Determinants of disease

338

severity among the elderly required further investigation.

339

We did not intend to demonstrate the efficacy of a specific treatment on COVID-19.

340

Patients with mild to moderate disease received only supportive care and recovered. They

341

could be discharged, suggesting the self-limiting nature of the non-severe cases. While

342

published randomized trials on chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir

343

have been unable to demonstrate treatment benefit [36-38], supportive care is crucial for

344

COVID-19 patients with the mild or moderate disease.

345

Understanding the full spectrum of COVID-19 is essential for estimating the

346

proportion of severe COVID-19 cases that require a large amount of healthcare resources.

347

Demand for hospital inpatient and ICU beds could be better predicted to mitigate the

348

overwhelming hospital burden after easing COVID-19 restriction. Although individuals

349

without risk factors who present with mild disease generally do not require hospitalization,

350

some of them might subsequently deteriorate.

351

This study has several limitations. First, the findings were based on a relatively small

352

sample size from a single center and may not be generalizable to other settings. However, the

353

proportion of patients in each category of the disease spectrum was comparable with those of

354

nationwide survey of China. This suggests that our sample may be representative of patients

355

with COVID-19 throughout the disease spectrum. Second, the study had risk of recall bias as

356

patients were asked to recall subjective events prior to admission. Third, not all blood

357

chemistry studies were performed in all patients and several non-routine tests (eg, serum

358

LDH, C-reactive protein, IL-6 level) were not investigated. Fourth, we used chest radiograph

359

as radiologic evidence of pneumonia. As chest radiograph is less sensitive than computed

360

tomography, the very mild pneumonia might have been missed. Likewise, arterial blood gas

361

was evaluated only in critical cases, so the incidence of ARDS may not have been correctly

362

estimated. Lastly, our institute has no testing facility for the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 so the

363

duration of viral RNA shedding may not represent the duration of viral viability.

364

In conclusion, the majority of patients with COVID-19 had mild illness. The

365

incidence of pneumonia of any severity was 39% (non-severe in 22%, severe in 14%, critical

366

in 3%). Most patients had a good final clinical outcomes. The case fatality rate in our cohort

367

was 2.1%. Increasing age, obesity, and higher temperature at presentation were potential

368

predictive factors of COVID-19 pneumonia.
