STRUCTURED SUMMARY

Background
Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) viral ribonucleic
acid (RNA), using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) are pivotal to
detecting current coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) and duration of detectable virus indicating
potential for infectivity.
Methods
We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies
of RT‐PCR test results in symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID,
medRxiv and COVID‐19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS‐
2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the
duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites.
Findings
Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS‐CoV‐2 infected
participants and 1619 test results, from ‐6 to 66 days post‐symptom onset and
hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling
between 0 to 4 days post‐symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93)
dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable
virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract
(URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within
individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post‐
symptom onset.
Interpretation
RT‐PCR misses detection of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; early sampling minimises
false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post‐symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing
may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias so
the positivity rates are probably overestimated.

PANEL: RESEARCH IN CONTEXT:

Evidence before this study
There are numerous reports of negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test results in
participants with known SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and increasing awareness that the ability of
RT‐PCR tests to detect virus depends on the timing of sample retrieval and anatomical
sampling site.
Individual studies suggest that positive test results from RT‐PCR with nasopharyngeal
sampling declines within a week of symptoms and that a positive test later in the disease
course is more likely from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or stool, but data are
inconsistent.
Added value of this study
We searched 5078 titles and abstracts for longitudinal studies reporting individual
participant data (IPD) for RT‐PCR for participants with COVID‐19 linked to either time since
symptom onset or time since hospitalisation. Search included SARS‐CoV‐2 and RT‐PCR
keywords and MeSH terms. Each included study was subject to careful assessment of risk of
bias. This IPD systematic review (SR) addresses RT‐PCR test detection rates at different
times since symptom onset and hospitalisation for different sampling sites, and summarises
the duration of detectable virus. To our knowledge, this is the first rapid SR addressing this
topic. We identified 32 studies available as published articles or pre‐prints between January
1st and April 24th 2020, including participants sampled at 11 different sampling sites and
some participants sampled at more than one site. At earlier time points, nasopharyngeal
sampling had the highest virus detection, but the duration of shedding was shorter
compared to lower respiratory tract sampling. At 10 to 14 days post‐symptom onset, the
percentage of positive nasopharyngeal test results was 54% compared to 89% at day 0 to 4.
Presence and duration of faecal detection varied by participant, and in nearly half duration
was shorter than respiratory sample detection. Virus detection varies for participants and
can continue to be detected up to 46 days post‐symptom onset or hospitalisation. The
included studies were open to substantial risk of bias, so the detection rates are probably
overestimates. There was also poor reporting of sampling methods and sparse data on

sampling methods that are becoming more widely implemented, such as self‐sampling and
short nasal swab sampling (anterior nares/mid turbinate).
Implications of all the available evidence
Results from this IPD SR of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing at different time points and using different
anatomical sample sites are important to inform strategies of testing. For prevention of
ongoing transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2, samples for RT‐PCR testing need to be taken as soon
as possible post‐symptom onset, as we confirm that RT‐PCR misses more people with
infection if sampling is delayed. The percentage of positive RT‐PCR tests is also highly
dependent on the anatomical site sampled in infected people. Sampling at more than one
anatomical site may be advisable as there is variation between individuals in the sites that
are infected, as well as the timing of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus detection at an anatomical site.
Testing ten days after symptom onset will lead to a higher frequency of negative tests,
particularly if using only upper respiratory tract sampling. However, our estimates may
considerably understate the frequency of negative RT‐PCR results in people with SARS‐CoV‐
2 infection. Further investment in this IPD approach is recommended as the amount data
available was small given the scale of the pandemic and the importance of the question.
More studies, learning from our observations about risk of bias and strengths of example
studies (Box 1, Box 2) are urgently needed to inform the optimal sampling strategy by
including self‐collected samples such as saliva and short nasal swabs. Better reporting of
anatomical sampling sites with a detailed methodology on sample collection is also urgently
needed.

MAIN TEXT

INTRODUCTION

Accurate testing is pivotal to controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), otherwise known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19).
Considerable political and medical emphasis has been placed on rapid access to testing both
to identify infected individuals so as to direct appropriate therapy, appropriate return to
work, and to implement containment measures to limit the spread of disease. However,
success depends heavily on test accuracy. Understanding when in the disease course the
virus is detectable is important for two purposes, firstly to understand when and how to
detect SARS‐CoV‐2, and secondly to understand how long individuals are likely to remain
infective posing a risk to others.

The success of COVID‐19 testing depends heavily on the use of accurate tests at the
appropriate time. Testing for active virus infection relies predominantly on reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which detects viral ribonucleic acid (RNA)
that is shed in varying amounts from different anatomical sites and at different times during
the disease course. It is increasingly understood that differences in virus load impact directly
on diagnostic accuracy, notably giving rise to negative tests in disease‐positive individuals1.
Positivity is contingent upon sufficient virus being present to trigger a positive test which
may depend on test site, sampling methods and timing2. For example, it is believed that
positive nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR declines within a week of symptoms so that a positive test
later in the disease course is more likely from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or
stool3. Nomenclature for anatomical site is also unclear, with a wide variety of overlapping
terms used such as “oral”, “throat”, “nasal”, “pharyngeal”, “nasopharyngeal”.

Because testing is pivotal to management and containment of COVID‐19, we performed an
individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of emerging evidence about test accuracy
by anatomical sampling site to inform optimal sampling strategies for SARS‐CoV‐2. We
aimed to examine at what time points during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection it is detectable at
different anatomical sites using RT‐PCR based tests.

METHODS

This IPD systematic review followed the recommendations of the PRISMA‐IPD checklist4.
Eligibility
Eligible articles were any case‐series or longitudinal studies reporting participants with
confirmed COVID‐19 tested at multiple times during their infection and provided IPD for RT‐
PCR test results at these times. We stipulated that test timings were linked to index dates of
time since symptom onset or time since hospital admission as well as COVID‐19 diagnosis by
positive RT‐PCR and/or suggestive clinical criteria, for example World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines5.
Search strategy and article selection
Search strings were designed and conducted subsequently in PubMed, LitCOVID and
medRxiv by an experienced information specialist (NR). The search end date was 24th April
2020. We additionally included references identified by COVID‐19: National Institute for
Health Research (NIHR) living map of living evidence
(http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/COVID19_MAP/covid_map_v4.html), COVID‐19 Living Evidence
(https://ispmbern.github.io/covid‐19/living‐review/) with a volunteer citizen science team,
"The Virus Bashers". Additional details S1.
Data extraction
Data were extracted into pre‐specified forms. We did not contact authors for additional
information. Study, participant characteristics, and ROB were extracted in Microsoft Excel
(KG, JS, SG, JA, AW, SM). Data included country, setting, date, number of participants and
IPD participants, inclusion criteria, IPD selection, participant age, sample types, RT‐PCR test
type and equipment, primers. RT‐PCR test results were extracted using Microsoft Access
(SM, BS, JP, ZZ, CH).
Risk of Bias
We could not identify an ideal risk‐of‐bias (ROB) tool for longitudinal studies of diagnostic
tests, so we adapted the risk of bias tool for diagnostic accuracy studies QUADAS‐26 to

include additional signalling questions to cover anticipated issues. ROB signalling questions,
evaluation criteria and domain assessment of potential bias are reported (S2).
Sampling method and grouping
Details of sampling sites and methods, including location of the sampling site(s), any sample
grouping (for example, if combined throat and nasal swabs), were extracted from full texts
by a clinician (NS) with queries referred to a second clinician (ST). If stated, details of
sampling methodology were recorded, including who collected samples, information
regarding anatomical location (e.g. how the nasopharynx was identified), and sample
storage. Additional details S3.
RT‐PCR test result conversion to binary results
IPD RT‐PCR results were extracted from each article and converted to binary results
(“positive” or “negative”). Data from Kaplan‐Meier (KM) curves were extracted using Web
digitizer 7. Additional details S3.
Data analysis
Days since symptom onset and days since hospital admission were calculated from reported
IPD. Data were presented collated across 5‐day time intervals for each sample method, with
longer times grouped within the longest time interval, and 95% CI were calculated for
proportions. For comparison of duration of positive RT‐PCR from respiratory tract (RT) and
faecal samples, analysis and graphical presentation was restricted to participants sampled
by both methods. Data analysis used STATA (14.2 StataCorp LP, Texas, USA). Additional
details S3.
Role of the funding source
Funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or
writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study
and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. The views expressed
are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department
of Health and Social Care.

RESULTS

Included studies
5078 articles were identified, 116 full text articles were screened, and 32 articles were
included8‐39 (Figure 1). Most articles were from China, in hospitalised adults participants
(Table 1). Articles reported on a total of 1023 participants and 1619 test results.
Twenty‐six (81%) articles reported data on test results since the start of symptoms, 23 (72%)
since hospital admission. Sixteen studies including 22% (229/1023) of the participants
reported both these time points: The median time between symptom onset and
hospitalisation was 5 days (interquartile range (IQR) 2 to 7 days). The median number of
participants per study was 22 (IQR 9 to 56, range 5 to 232) and the median number of RT‐
PCR test results per participant was 4 (IQR 2 to 9) (Table 2).
Sampling site reporting
Articles variably specified sampling sites according to anatomical location, or grouped more
than one site for analysis, for example as upper RT (see S4). The most frequent sample sites
were faeces (n=13), nasopharyngeal (n=10) and throat (n=9), although there was a range of
other sites including blood, urine, semen, and conjunctival swabs (Table 2). Details of
sampling method were generally absent. Two studies specified the person taking the
samples. One study described how the nasopharynx was identified and the swab technique
(length of contact time with the nasopharynx and twisting). Five studies specified samples
storage and transport details.
Sampling site positivity over time
We present RT‐PCR test results for 11 different sampling sites at different times during
SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Figures 2 and 3 show the number of positive and negative RT‐PCR
results for 5‐day time intervals since symptom onset and time from hospital admission,
respectively.
The sampling sites yielding the greatest proportion of positive tests were nasopharyngeal,
throat, sputum, or faeces. Insufficient data were available to evaluate saliva and semen.
Only 33% of participants who were tested with blood samples had detectable virus

(44/133), and almost no samples from urine or conjunctival sampling detected virus
presence.
Using nasopharyngeal sampling, 89% (147/166, 95% CI 83 to 93) RT‐PCR test results were
positive between 0 to 4 days post‐symptom onset and 81% (100/124, 95% CI 73 to 87) 0 to
4 days post hospital admission (Figure 2 and 3). At 10 to 14 days the percentage of test
results positive reduced to 54% (120/222, 95% CI 47 to 61) post‐symptoms and 45% (37/82,
95% CI 34 to 57) post‐admission (S6, S7).
Using throat sampling at 0 to 4 days post‐symptoms, 90% (91/101, 95% CI 83 to 95) of test
results from participants with SARS‐CoV‐2 were detected by RT‐PCR sampling, falling to 42%
(58/139, 95% CI 33 to 50) at 10 to 14 days post‐symptom onset (Figure 2, S6, S7). Similar
results were observed for time since hospital admission, where at 0 to 4 days 80% (173/215,
95% CI 75 to 86) of result were positive, falling to 35% (55/155, 95% CI 28 to 44) between 10
to 14 days (Figure 3, S6, S7). Using faecal sampling, 55% test results are positive (22/40, 95%
CI 38 to 71) at 0 to 4 days post‐symptom onset.
Upper and lower respiratory tract sampling
We further grouped sites into upper (URT) and lower (LRT) respiratory tract. The rate of
sample positivity reduced faster from URT sites compared to LRT sites (Figure 4A). Given
that analysis across all participants is likely to be influenced by preferential URT sampling of
participants with less severe disease, we also analysed participants who underwent both
URT and LRT sampling. Again, URT sites on average cleared faster (median 12 days, 95% CI 8
to 15 days) than LRT sites (median 28 days, 95% CI 20 to not estimable; Figure 4B); the
majority of participants clear virus from URT site before LRT (Figure 4C). Data based on time
since hospital admission are consistent with data for time since symptom onset.
Faecal vs respiratory tract sampling
Across participants sampled by both RT and faecal sampling since hospital admission, 29%
of participants were detected using RT sampling but not by faecal sampling, (52/177
participants, 95% CI 23 to 37%, 10 studies). The time to RT‐PCR tests becoming undetectable
varied greatly by participant, although time to undetectable virus was similar for both
sampling sites (Figure 5), in participants with RT‐PCR test results from both RT and faecal
10

samples. Thirty nine out of 89 participants (44%, 95% CI 33 to 55%) had a shorter duration
of detection in faecal samples than in RT samples.
Median time to clearance from RT was shorter in participants based on time since
hospitalisation (125 participants, p=0.014), whilst similar in participants since onset of
symptoms (87 participants, p=0.15) (S8).
Intermittent false negative results
Many articles reported intermittent false negative RT‐PCR test results for participants within
the monitoring time span. Where participant viral loads were reported, several different
profiles were distinguished; two examples are shown in Figure 613,14. Intermittent false
negative results were reported either where the level of virus is close to the limit of
detection, or in participants with high viral load but for unclear reasons.
Risk of bias
The proportion of studies with high, low, or unclear ROB for each domain is shown in Figure
7 and ROB for individual studies is shown in S5. All studies were judged at high ROB. All but
one were judged at high ROB for the participant selection domain16, mainly as they only
included participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection based on at least one positive
PCR test. Studies also frequently selected a subset of the participant cohort for longitudinal
RT‐PCR testing, and only results for these participants were included in the study. Ten
studies were judged at unclear ROB for the index test domain as the schedule of testing was
based on clinician choice rather than being pre‐specified by the study or clinical guidelines,
or because the samples used for PCR testing were not pre‐specified. Eleven studies were
judged at high ROB for the flow and timing domain mainly because continued testing was
influenced by easy access to participants, such as by continued hospitalisation.

DISCUSSION

Key findings
Negative RT‐PCR test results were common in people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection confirming
that RT‐PCR testing misses identification of people with disease. Our IPD systematic review

has established that sampling site and time of testing are key determinants of whether
SARS‐CoV‐2 infected individuals are identified by RT‐PCR.
We found that nasopharyngeal sampling was positive in approximately 89% (95% CI 83 to
93) of tests within 4 days of either symptom onset. Sampling ten days after symptom onset
greatly reduced the chance of a positive test result.
There were limited data on new methods of sample collection like saliva in these
longitudinal studies. Sputum samples have similar or higher levels of detection to
nasopharyngeal sampling, although this may be influenced by preferential sputum sampling
in severely ill participants. Although based on few participants tested at both sampling sites,
URT sites have faster viral clearance than LRT in most of these participants; 50% of
participants were undetectable at URT sites 12 days after symptom onset compared to 28
days for LRT.

We found that faecal sampling is not suitable for initial detection of disease, as up to 30% of
participants detected using respiratory sampling are not detected using faecal sampling.
Viral detection in faecal samples maybe useful to establish virus clearance, although as
noted, whether RT or faecal samples have longer duration of viral detection varies between
participants.

All included studies were judged at high ROB so results of this review should be interpreted
with caution. Box 1 provides an overview of the major methodological limitations and their
potential impact on study results. A major source of bias is that all but one study 18
restricted inclusion to participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection based on at least
one positive RT‐PCR test, meaning that the percentage of positive RT‐PCR testing is likely to
be overestimated.
Lack of technical details, for example of how samples are taken and RT‐PCR tests performed,
limit the applicability of findings to current testing. Compared to real life, studies were likely
to use more invasive sampling methods, use experienced staff to obtain samples, and
sample participants in hospital settings where sample handling could be standardised.
Consequently, estimates of test performance are likely to be overestimated compared to
real‐world clinical use and in community population testing including self‐test kits.

These limitations have important implications for how testing strategies should be
implemented and in particular how a negative RT‐PCR test result should be interpreted.

Putting the findings into context of literature
The accuracy of RT‐PCR testing is limited by sampling sites used, methods and the need to
test as soon as possible from symptom onset in order to detect the virus. Previous studies
have established that in COVID‐19 infection viral loads typically peak just before symptoms
and at symptom onset3. To our knowledge, there has been no prior systematic review of RT‐
PCR using IPD to quantify the percentage of persons tested who are positive and how this
varies by time and sampling site.
Understanding the distribution of anatomical sites with detectable virus is clinically relevant,
especially given independent viral replication sites in nose and throat using distinct and
separate genetic colonies16. Understanding of different patterns of detection and duration
of virus detection at different body sites is essential when designing strategies of testing to
contain virus spread. Notably, it is unclear if detection of virus in faeces is important in
disease transmission, although faecal infection was shown in SARS and MERS40.
Strengths of study
This review uses robust systematic review methods to synthesise published literature and
identifies overall patterns not possible from individual articles. Using IPD, we examined data
across studies and avoided study level ecological biases present when using overall study
estimates. IPD regarding sample site at different timepoints during infection is vital because
it provides an overview of test performance impossible from individual studies alone.
Synthesised IPD can also substantiate or reject patterns appearing within individual studies.
Within participant paired comparisons of sampling sites also becomes possible with
sufficient data.
Limitations of study
The main limitation is the risk of bias in the included studies. Although constraints were
understandable given the circumstances in which the studies were done, the consequences
for validity need to be highlighted. The percentage of positive RT‐PCR testing is likely to be

overestimated, because inclusion was restricted to participants with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2
infection based on at least one positive RT‐PCR test in all but one study18. This means that
people who had a COVID‐19 infection but never tested positive on at least one RT‐PCR test
would not have been included. This could arise if SARS‐CoV‐2 is not present at easily
sampled sites or at the time participants were tested. This makes it impossible to determine
the true false negative rate of the test – the proportion of people who actually have SARS‐
CoV‐2 but would receive a negative RT‐PCR test result. It is possible that only half of persons
infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 may test positive, as a community surveillance study in Italy found
only 53% (80/152) persons tested RT‐PCR positive in households quarantined for 18 days
with persons who tested PCR positive38. The same study also identified households where
no one tested RT‐PCR positive, but where there were clusters of persons with symptoms
typical of COVID.
Poor reporting of sampling methods and sites impaired our ability to distinguish between
and report on variability between them. For some sampling methods such as saliva and
throat swabs, more studies are needed. There were also sparse data on sampling methods
that are becoming more widespread, such as participant self‐sampling41 and short nasal
swab sampling (anterior nares/mid turbinate)42. Our index times may be subject to bias as
symptom onset is somewhat subjective and hospital admission practices vary by country,
pandemic stage, and hospital role (i.e. healthcare vs. isolation). The results presented do not
correspond to following the same participants across time, but the testing at clinically
relevant time snapshots reported from individual studies, so that participants tested at later
time points are likely to have more severe disease; this does not limit the interpretation of
results in understanding testing of participants in most clinical contexts. Comparisons of
sampling sites should be restricted to participants tested at the relevant sites.
We have used analysis methods that do not include clustering within studies, to keep
analyses simple to understand and present, and to avoid complications of fitting models
where the number of participants in each cluster varies. Ultimately, many potentially
eligible studies did not report IPD which led to their exclusion, or only reported IPD for a
subset of participants in the study. We would welcome contact and data sharing with
clinicians and authors to rectify this.

Implications for policy/practice/future research
To avoid the consequences of missed infection, samples for RT‐PCR testing need to be taken
as soon as symptoms start for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in preventing ongoing
transmission.
Even within four days of symptom onset some participants infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 will
receive negative test results. Testing at later times will result in a higher percentage of false
negative tests in people with SARS‐CoV‐2, particularly at upper RT sampling sites. After ten
days post‐symptoms it may be important to use lower RT or faecal sampling. Valid estimates
are essential for clinicians interpreting RT‐PCR results. However, ROB considerations suggest
that the positive percentage rates we have estimated may be optimistic, possibly
considerably so.
Participants can have detectable virus in different body compartments, so virus may not be
detected if samples are only taken from a single site. Some hospitals in the United Kingdom
now routinely take RT‐PCR samples from multiple sites, such as the nose and throat. More
studies are urgently needed on evolving sampling strategies such as self‐collected samples
which include saliva and short nasal swabs. Future studies should avoid the risks of bias we
have identified by precisely reporting the anatomical sampling sites with a detailed
methodology on sample collection.
Further sharing of IPD will be important and we would welcome contact from groups with
IPD data we can include in ongoing research.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1: PRISMA flowchart
Figure 2: Number of positive and negative RT‐PCR test results since symptom onset
Each panel shows a separate site used in participant sampling. Nasopharyngeal, saliva,
sputum were used where clearly reported. Throat included throat and oropharyngeal. Other
URT includes samples reported in articles as: nasal, mixed nasal and throat, oral,
pharyngeal, or upper respiratory tract. For pharyngeal sampling it was not clear if this was
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal. Other LRT includes sampling reported as lower
respiratory tract or one article including pleural fluid sampling. Blood included serum,
plasma, or blood. Faeces included stool or anal swab.
Each panel shows 5‐day time periods since the onset of symptoms: 0‐4 days, 5‐9 days, 10‐14
days, 15‐19 days, 20‐25 days, 26‐30 days, 31‐34 days, 35 to max days.
The numbers of positive RT‐PCR tests are shown as dark blue bars and dark grey bars
between 0 to 14 days and 15 to 40 days respectively, and the number of negative RT‐PCR
results are shown similarly as light blue bars and light grey bars. Different colours are used
before and after 15 days to indicate caution, as after 15 days testing is enriched in more
severely ill participants. The total number of tests within a particular time period can be
read from the x‐axis.

Figure 6: Example participants with intermittent false negative results
Figure 6A show a participant where virus levels have reduced over time to a level around
the limit of viral detection, and at these low levels of virus intermittent negative results will
occur due to differences in the location or amount of sample.
Figure 6B shows an example of a participant with high viral load, but where alternate RT‐
PCR test results report high viral load or undetectable virus.

Figure 7: Risk of bias by adapted QUADAS‐2 domain
An adapted version of QUADAS‐2 for longitudinal studies was used (Supp_table 3). For each
domain, the percentage of studies by concern for potential risk of bias is shown: low
(green), unclear (yellow) and high (red).

(applicability)

Details of bias and applicability issues
In these studies, the reference test usually incorporates RT-PCR (index test)
 RT-PCR testing is usually a key component of identifying people with SARSCoV-2 infection
 Participants will not be detected or included in these studies when SARS-CoV-2
is not present at easily sampled sites and at the time that participants were
available for testing

Most participants are identified or present based on respiratory tract symptoms such
as cough or respiratory distress.
 Participants will not be detected or included in these studies when less common
symptoms or asymptomatic
 Participants included will be biased to over-represent people with detectable virus
in respiratory tract sampling sites and at times frequently used for testing (post
symptom onset or at admission to hospital)

 Studies included are likely to use more invasive sampling methods than
acceptable in widespread population testing. For example, nasopharyngeal testing
is likely in many current studies to be based on long swabs and self test kits
 Studies will use experienced staff to obtain samples, handle, process and conduct
tests
 Studies are mostly sampling participants in hospital settings or in specialised
research community testing research where sample handling, transport and
storage have been standardised

Impact on interpretation of study data
Unclear how many and what severity of participants with
SARS-CoV-2 are not included in studies
People who do not have a positive RT-PCR test at some
point are excluded. This could lead to over-estimation of
positivity

Rates of positivity will be inflated as only people with virus
accessible for sampling for RT-PCR tests will be included in
studies
Unclear how many and what severity of participants with
SARS-CoV-2 are not included in studies

Studies will inflate positivity for sampling sites that overlap
with sampling sites used in RT-PCR reference testing
 For example, we identified 30% of participants with RT
positivity but with negative results from faecal sampling.
However, if participants had only faecal virus, would they
have been included in the studies?
Percentage of people with detectable virus may be
overestimated when testing is applied in real world clinical
use and in population testing

BOX 1: Biases and issues in interpretation

Index test:
RT-PCR
(applicability)

Index test:
RT-PCR
(applicability)

Details of bias and applicability issues
 Variation in RT-PCR kits are minimised as studies are based in few hospitals or
limited to a research setting
Sample RNA extraction methods are designed predominantly for respiratory
samples
 RT-PCR sample preparation kits used are mostly designed for extraction of virus
from respiratory samples, not from faecal samples. It is unclear how efficiently
these kits extract virus RNA from stool samples
RT-PCR tests detect both infectious and inactive (inactive due to immune system or
dead) virus.

Flow and timing

 Few studies link RT-PCR testing to cell assays to test for infectious virus
Rate of virus aggregation or clearance by immune system may affect the sampling
efficiency at some sampling sites
 Both the innate and adaptive immune system will aggregate and clear virus
particles from bodily fluids. It is not clear what the time scale of clearance or how
this influences detection of virus at different sites and at which time points
Reporting of sampling sites and methods is poor
 Poor reporting may have led to less ideal grouping of sampling in analysis
 Some studies are likely to use a variety of nasopharyngeal sampling methods
depending on the individual participants, but the type of sampling is typically
reported at a study level for a particular sampling site
Uncertainty and inconsistencies in time of sampling

Flow and timing

 Time of symptom onset can be subjective unless based on fever, but some
participants do not have fever.
 Time of symptom onset may be different if asked of participants in ICU setting
 Time of hospitalisation and discharge may be affected by function hospitalisation
serves in containment of disease spread. In some studies, the hospitals were also
quarantine centres, so participants were hospitalised immediately at onset of mild
symptoms rather than restricted to patients needing oxygen.
Clinical cohort within studies changes across time points

Impact on interpretation of study data

Percentage of people with virus present in faecal samples
and duration of shedding in faecal samples may be
underestimated
Percentage of people with clinically important detectable
virus may be overestimated

Percentage of people with detectable virus may be
underestimated

Percentage of people with detectable virus may be over or
underestimated

Percentage of people with detectable virus may be over or
underestimated at particular times

Percentage of people with detectable virus may be
overestimated at particular later time points as these
correspond to participants who were severely ill

Details of bias and applicability issues
 Participants who have recovered from COVID-19 in most studies are typically not
tested after 2 negative tests 24 hours apart.
 Many studies only test inpatients at the hospital, so the participants sampled
between 0 to 14 days typically have less severe disease than those tested longer
Some studies only publish IPD data for a selection of people

Impact on interpretation of study data

Available IPD data may not represent a typical spectrum of
participants in the different settings (community setting,
hospital, ICU, nursing home, prison)
Published data is likely to be biased towards publication of research active groups
Percentage of people with detectable virus may be
which may not represent typical real world
overestimated
BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; ICU = intensive care unit; IPD = individual participant data; RNA = ribonucleic acid; RTPCR reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
