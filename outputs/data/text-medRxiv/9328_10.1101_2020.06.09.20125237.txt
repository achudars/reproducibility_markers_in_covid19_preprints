Abstract
Background: Policy responses to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term
care (LTC) require robust and timely evidence on mortality and spread of the disease in these
settings. The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on
mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC.
Methods: We report findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies
identified through database searches up to 26 June 2020. We searched seven databases
(MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research
Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality
and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC.
Included studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19
related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as
incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively.
Findings: A total of 54 study reports for 49 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were
included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between
0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 0.4% and 64.0% among staff at affected facilities.
Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 17.1% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality
rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies of outbreaks, no LTC staff members had died.
Studies of wider LTC populations found that between 0.4% and 40.8% of users, and between
4.0% and 23.8% of staff were infected, although the generalisability of these studies is limited.
There was limited information on the impact of COVID-19 on LTC in the community.
Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19
pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between
outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a substantial morbidity and
mortality toll on the world.1 Over the course of the evolving pandemic, public attention in some
countries has shifted towards long-term care facilities as “ground zero”.2 Early evidence on risk
factors for severe outcomes suggested that residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing
homes and residential care facilities for people who need medical support or support in their
activities of daily living, may be particularly vulnerable. Studies have shown that older people
and those with underlying health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, chronic lung disease, obesity, and cancer, are more likely to experience severe outcomes
after contracting the disease.3 Importantly, case series from China, Italy, the United States (US),
and the United Kingdom (UK), have shown higher mortality rates among older people who
contract COVID-19.4,5,6,7 Official figures showed that a substantial proportion of COVID-19
related deaths – more than 50% of all deaths in many high-income countries – is concentrated
among long-term care users.8 While older people and those with chronic conditions would
already have higher mortality rates in the absence of a pandemic, a modelling study for the
United Kingdom has shown that excess deaths due to COVID-19 are likely to be concentrated
among older people.9 It has also been suggested that older age and some chronic conditions
were associated with an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID19.8
While the combination of a population of older people with underlying health conditions living
in close proximity to each other suggests the long-term care sector to be at particularly high
risk, specific evidence on COVID-19 infections and associated deaths in this setting was initially
slow to emerge. An early rapid review on deaths in care homes conducted in mid-April 2020
identified only three studies on infection rates and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in longterm care homes (all from the US).8 These studies showed wide variation in the proportion of
residents and staff being infected (with the majority of people who contracted COVID-19
asymptomatic at the time of testing), in the spread of the disease between different care homes,
and in case fatality rates among nursing home residents, which were reported to be as high as
33%.10,11,12 As the pandemic continues to spread, more evidence about the spread and impact of
COVID-19 in long-term care settings is emerging, including outbreak reports and studies about
infection rates and outcomes among those receiving long-term care services (long-term care
users) and those providing them (long-term care staff), including both for institutional settings
and community-based services. Indeed, the number of records in PubMed retrieved through a
combination of search terms for COVID-19 and long-term care increased by approximately 100
records per week from the end of April to the end of June.
Given the vulnerability of the population relying on long-term care services and the potentially
large burden of COVID-19 in this sector, timely and evidence-based policy responses are
required. We therefore aimed to systematically collate and synthesise available and newly
emerging evidence on the number of long-term care users and staff who contract COVID-19 and
experience severe outcomes, including death, and the spread of disease in long-term care
settings.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review of available evidence on COVID-19 infection rates and
mortality among users and providers of long-term care services (PROSPERO: CRD42020183557).
Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the situation and an expected increase in research focusing
on COVID-19 in long-term care, database searches will be updated continuously, and findings
incorporated as a living systematic review. The reporting of this review is PRISMA-compliant
(see supplemental file).13
Search Strategy & Selection Criteria
Potentially eligible studies were identified through systematic searches of seven electronic
databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL plus, Web of Science, Global Health, the World Health
Organization’s COVID-19 Research Database, medRxiv). Search terms were based on published
search blocks for COVID-19 related studies and were adapted to each database (see
supplemental file).14,15 We included full study reports and research letters published in peerreviewed journals or on pre-print servers since 1 January 2020 in order to capture newly
emerging evidence pertinent to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial database searches were
conducted on 15 May 2020 and updated weekly up to 26 June 2020.
Inclusion criteria were defined following the CoCoPop (Condition, Context and Population)
framework, as recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute for systematic reviews of prevalence
and incidence.16 Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported primary data on COVID-19
related mortality (including mortality rate among the population of interest, case fatality rate
(CFR), and excess deaths compared to previous periods) or spread of COVID-19 among users
and staff of long-term care services. Long-term care services included both institutional and
community (i.e., care provided in the homes of patients) settings. We excluded studies that
focused on COVID-19 mortality and infection rates in non-long-term care settings, studies of
infectious disease outbreaks other than COVID-19, modelling studies, as well as opinion pieces
and review articles that did not report original data. We had previously included reports of
official figures of COVID-19 deaths and the proportion of long-term care users among them but
decided to exclude these figures as more evidence from primary research studies became
available. Official figures are summarised by members of our group in separate reports.8
Title and abstract screening, as well as full text review was undertaken by three reviewers (AJ,
MS-K, and MT). To ensure consistency, all studies deemed eligible for inclusion were again
reviewed by one reviewer (MS-K). Records reporting on the same study or outbreak were
combined.
Data Extraction & Synthesis
A standardised template was used to extract data at the study level, including information on
study design; care setting (institutional vs. community); how COVID-19 was diagnosed and
confirmed; baseline characteristics of participants; absolute number of deaths and mortality
rates for people with confirmed and suspected COVID-19; CFRs; excess deaths; absolute

numbers and rates of confirmed and suspected COVID-19; and rates of hospitalisation and
intensive care unit (ICU) admissions among people with confirmed and suspected COVID-19.
All study participant characteristics and outcomes data were extracted separately for long-term
care users and staff. For rates, we also recorded how numerator and denominator were defined,
as well as the follow-up time over which outcomes were measured.
Based on extracted data, we calculated the mortality rate directly attributable to COVID-19 (all
deaths among those who contracted COVID-19/all long-term care users or staff), CFR (all deaths
among those who contracted COVID-19/all long-term care users or staff who contracted
COVID-19), incidence of COVID-19 (all those who contracted COVID-19/all long-term care
users or staff), and incidence of hospital and ICU admissions (all hospital or ICU admissions/all
long-term care users or staff who contracted COVID-19). Due to heterogeneity in the definitions
of numerators, denominators, and follow-up times across included studies, data were not
pooled. Instead, results are summarised narratively and presented in tables, including
information on sample characteristics, follow-up time, and case definitions, as appropriate.
Where studies reported on overlapping populations, we gave preference to those with larger
sample sizes and longer follow-up times.
In addition to the pre-specified outcomes above, we extracted information on the proportion of
asymptomatic people with COVID-19 at time of testing, and findings of studies comparing
outcomes in long-term care users to others.
Critical Appraisal
The quality of included studies reporting figures relating to mortality rates, CFR, or disease
incidence were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for prevalence
studies.17 The tool includes nine questions about the appropriateness of the sampling frame,
sampling of participants, sample size, description of study setting and participants, data
analysis, identification of cases, measure of disease, statistical analysis, and response rate. We
summarised appraisals as the number of items that were deemed appropriate for each study.
We did not assess risk of bias across studies.
Results
The first report of this living systematic review was published on 9 June 2020,18 and an updated
version on 29 June 2020. Since then, 21 additional studies were included, leading to a total of 54
study reports for 49 unique studies or outbreak reports (Figure 1).7,10,11,12,19,20,21,22,23,
24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68

An overview of study characteristics is provided in Table 1. Twenty reported on individual
outbreaks, while the rest reported on wider populations. Included studies were conducted in 14
countries (20 in the United States, six each in Spain and the United Kingdom, three each in
Canada and South Korea, two each in Belgium and France, and one each in Germany, Hong
Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, and Poland). All included studies except for

three were exclusively conducted in institutional care settings. Three studies reported on homebased or community-based care.
Evidence on disease incidence in institutionalised long-term care settings
Evidence on the spread of disease within institutional long-term care settings was available from
25 studies,20,21,22,26,29,30,31,34,36,39,41,45,47,48,51,52,56,58,60,62,63,64,66,67,68 including 17 studies reporting the
number of people who contracted COVID-19 in facilities facing potential outbreaks (Table 2)
and eight studies reporting relevant figures among regional or national populations of longterm care facilities (Table 3).
The incidence rate for cohorts of residents at long-term care institutions where an outbreak
occurred varied widely. The lowest estimates was 0% over a three-week period and was observed
in a South Korean long-term care hospital, where an infected care worker had been working
throughout the facility for two days while symptomatic.34 Following the diagnosis of the index
case, exposed care workers were quarantined at home, while remaining staff who continued to
work were quarantined in a hotel. Considerably higher incidence rates of between 40.3% and
71.7% were reported from outbreaks in facilities in the US, UK, and France.
The incidence rate for cohorts of long-term care staff at outbreak facilities was overall lower
compared to residents. Among nine studies testing all or close to all staff members, the rate of
infections was generally below 10%, with the exception of one French study reporting a rate of
23.5% over six weeks (during weekly testing, no new people with COVID-19 were detected after
the first two weeks) and a US study reporting a rate of 19.9% over six weeks across four outbreak
facilities.51,64 Another point-prevalence study from the UK found that 4.1% of a sample of
asymptomatic staff representing various roles across three nursing homes (including care
workers as well as kitchen staff, administrators, and maintenance personnel) tested positive.30
The rate of infection was higher for the remaining three studies, but this included two where
testing was only conducted for some staff members, and one report of an outbreak that did not
provide details on testing.
Population-wide estimates of infection ranged from 0.4% to 40.8% for different populations of
LTC users (Table 3). Only three studies were based on systematic testing, including the two
studies reporting the highest rates of infection. However, some caveats about their findings
should be noted. Kennelly et al. only included nursing homes in Dublin and Eastern Ireland that
reported outbreaks and responded to their survey, thereby excluding more than half of all
nursing homes in their sampling frame.56 Borras-Bermejo et al. tested residents and staff of 69
nursing homes in Barcelona but excluded those who already had a confirmed COVID-19
diagnosis.52 Rudolph et al. tested residents of Veteran Affairs community living centres in the
US (predominantly male) but excluded those who had already been tested (due to showing
symptoms, or prior to admission to a facility) and those who did not participate in universal
testing.66
Two of the studies based on systematic testing also reported population-wide prevalence among
LTC staff, with 23.8% of staff at nursing homes in Dublin and Eastern Ireland testing positive

and 15.2% of staff at nursing homes in Barcelona.52,56 Another Spanish study found that 9.5% of
health care workers in nursing homes in the region of Leon had antibodies, but was likely to
underestimate true prevalence due to the testing strategy.58 Finally, a survey among facilities
providing care to people living with dementia and older people in England found that 4.0% of
staff members had contracted confirmed COVID-19 at some point during the pandemic (no
systematic testing was in place at the time of the survey).62
Data on asymptomatic residents and staff who tested positive for COVID-19 was extracted from
13 studies (Table 4). 22,26,30,31,35,36,39,40,48,51,52,56,63 Definitions of symptomatic cases differed (see lists
of symptoms in the table), as did the number of identified cases, leading to a range of
asymptomatic people who contracted COVID-19 at the time of testing between 7% and 78%
among long-term care residents, and between 24% and 100% among staff.
Evidence on case fatality rates in institutionalised long-term care settings
CFR is the proportion of people with confirmed COVID-19 who die. CFRs for 11 studies of all
people at long-term care institutions facing outbreaks (including COVID-19 positive and
negative residents and staff) are summarised in Table 5,10,22,26,29,30,36,39,41,48,51,63 while CFRs for seven
studies of COVID-19 positive populations are described further down.23,25,32,38,60,67,68
For most studies included in Table 5, the source population for the identification of people with
COVID-19 were all or close to all (>90%) residents or staff at long-term care institutions where
an outbreak occurred. The CFR among long-term care users for these studies ranged from 0%
to 33.7%, with differences in follow-up time between one and 12 weeks. The CFR among longterm care staff was 0% in all included studies. These figures of outbreaks at individual facilities
are complemented by a survey of nursing homes experiencing outbreaks in Dublin and Eastern
Ireland, which found a CFR of 25.8% for residents with confirmed COVID-19.56
Not included in Table 5 are CFRs reported by seven studies for which the source population
consisted exclusively of people who contracted COVID-19.23,25,32,38,60,67,68 Due to the absence of
systematic testing, these studies tended to only include symptomatic people in the
denominator, resulting in higher CFRs compared to studies based on systematic testing, as
described below.
Prieto-Alhambra et al. found the 30-day mortality rate among 10,795 nursing home residents
who were registered with a clinical or lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis in a regional primary
care database in Catalonia (Spain) to be 25.3% (95% CI 24.2-26.4%).38 This was considerably
higher compared to the 30-day mortality rate for all other people with COVID-19 in the database
(4.0%, 95% CI 3.9-4.2%), although these findings were not adjusted for age and underlying
chronic conditions.
Baker et al. found that 40.7% of 60 nursing or residential home residents with lab-confirmed
COVID-19 who were admitted to a teaching hospital in Newcastle (UK) died within a 28-day
period.23 Compared to non-care home residents, the unadjusted odds ratio for death was 6.19
(95% CI 3.32-11.8).

De Smet et al. report that 52% of COVID-19 patients at a geriatric department were admitted
from long-term care facilities, and the CFR for those was 28.6%.25
The source population was unclear for Kemenesi et al., which reported the number of deaths
among all nursing home residents with confirmed COVID-19 in Hungary to be 4%.32 It is unclear
how people contracting COVID-19 in nursing homes were identified.
Similarly, the CFR of 27.8% in Brown et al. was calculated across all nursing homes in the
province of Ontario, Canada, but this was based on reporting of cases to the authorities, rather
than on systematic testing of all residents.68
The CFR was 14.3% for seven people with confirmed COVID-19 among those receiving visiting
medical care at assisted living facilities in Ohio (US).60
Finally, Verbeek et al. report that 16 of 29 people with confirmed COVID-19 at 26 nationally
representative nursing homes in the Netherlands died, but did not provide a time period for
these figures (CFR 55.2%).67
Evidence on mortality rates in long-term care settings
Table 6 presents mortality rates for people who contracted COVID-19 from 11 studies of
outbreaks at long-term care institutions.26,29,30,34,36,39,41,48,51,54,63 The source populations for these
studies are all or close to all (>90%) residents or staff at long-term care institutions where an
outbreak occurred. For these studies, the mortality rate for all or nearly all residents over a 1-to12-week follow-up period was between 0.0% and 17.1%. Due to limited data on source population
and causes of deaths, we did not include an outbreak report from another skilled nursing facility
in the US in this Table.50 Assuming full occupancy at the 150-bed facility, and all 29 reported
deaths having been caused by COVID-19, the mortality rate would be 19.3% of all residents over
a 3.5-week period.
There were two studies reporting on mortality among all staff members who were screened, and
in both of these outbreaks, no member of staff had died after follow-up periods of 3 and 9.5
weeks, respectively.29,34
Information on excess deaths among long-term care residents was only available from two
studies in the London area (UK). One study of outbreaks in four nursing homes estimated an
increase in all-cause mortality by 203% for a two-month period compared to the average of the
preceding two years.30 In contrast, a study of three different homes in the London area found
the number of deaths over 12 weeks comparable to average mortality rates from the previous
five years.48
Three studies reported the number of COVID-19 related deaths among wider populations of
long-term care users. The proportion of all nursing home residents who died having contracted
COVID-19 was 1.8% across all nursing homes in Ontario, Canada (1,452 deaths among 78,607

residents),68 and 0.8% across 26 nursing homes representing all regions in the Netherlands (16
deaths among 2,011 residents).67 However, neither of the two studies was based on systematic
testing of residents and both could have underestimated the true number of residents dying
having contracted the disease. A considerably higher proportion was reported for a sample of 21
nursing homes in Eastern Ireland and Dublin (10.5% of all residents over a 12-week period).56
However, this study was limited to nursing homes with active outbreaks and was missing
information from approximately one third of homes in the sampling frame.
Evidence on hospitalisations and ICU admissions from institutionalised long-term care settings
Nine studies provided information on the rate of hospitalisations among long-term care
residents with COVID-19 diagnosis,10,22,29,38,39,40,43,60,63 (Table 6). Hospitalisation rates for longterm care residents varied between 0.0% and 54.4% for follow-up periods of between three and
14 weeks.
Hospitalisation rates for long-term care staff with COVID-19 diagnosis were 0.0% and 6.0% in
two studies in US skilled nursing facilities.
Two studies reported the number of people who contracted confirmed COVID-19 among longterm care users who were admitted to the ICU. Arons et al. report that 5.3% of 48 nursing home
residents with a positive PCR test were admitted to an ICU over a 3.5-week period.22 Roxby et
al. report that none of the four residents at an assisted living facility with positive PCR test were
admitted to an ICU over a three-week period.39
Evidence on impact of COVID-19 on people who use long-term care community services
Only three included studies focused on people receiving long-term care in the community.
One US study reported on people with intellectual and developmental disability receiving longterm care services in the community, including in their family homes, foster care homes, or
group homes (although some also lived in intermediate care facilities).46 Among a total
population of 11,540 individuals, there were 66 with confirmed COVID-19 (0.6%) over a 100-day
period. Only symptomatic people were tested. The CFR among people with confirmed COVID19 was 4.5%, and 22.7% required hospitalisation.
The same organisation providing services to people with intellectual and developmental
disability also reported on their experience providing home health and personal care to older
people.61 Over 100 days, 67 people who contracted confirmed COVID-19 were detected (less than
0.3% of all clients). 47 of 67 were detected while living in the community. Among these, 17
required hospitalisation and 13 died.
The third study reported a total of 84 people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 among the
users of a memory unit and day care centre for people with cognitive disorders in Barcelona
(Spain), with a CFR of 44.1%.49

Evidence on outcomes in long-term care residents compared to others
Seven of the included studies compared outcomes in people who contracted COVID-19 between
long-term care users and others. These studies generally found that long-term care users had
worse outcomes, including higher 28-day-mortality (unadjusted odds ratio for death of nursing
home or residential home residents admitted to hospital compared to non-residents: 6.19, 95%
CI 3.32-11.8),23 30-day-mortality (25.3%, 95% CI 24.2-26.4%, among nursing home residents who
contracted COVID-19 and were registered in a primary care database compared to 4.0%, 95%
CI 3.9-4.2%, among all other people with COVID-19 in the database),38 and overall mortality
(incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 mortality comparing Ontario long-term care residents to
community-living adults 70 years and older: 13.1, 95% CI 9.9-17.3),27 as well as increased risk of
complicated disease (odds ratio for deteriorating disease, admission to ICU, or death,
comparing nursing home residents to non-residents over 65 years of age: 2.48, 95% CI 1.294.65).43 Bhatraju et al. report that, among 24 patients admitted to the intensive care units of
nine hospitals in the Seattle area (US), six (25%) were residents of skilled nursing facilities.7
Two studies did not find a statistically significant association between long-term care users and
worse COVID-19 outcomes. De Smet et al. found that short-term mortality was not associated
with long-term care residence in a cohort of COVID-19 patients at a geriatric department.25
Palaiodimos et al. did not find that nursing home residents fared worse than communitydwelling patients in a retrospective cohort study of the first 200 lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases
in a teaching hospital in New York, US.37 There was no statistically significant difference
between community-based and skilled nursing facility based patients for in-hospital mortality
(OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.42-1.91; p= 0.779), increasing oxygen requirements (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.592.21; p= 0.701), and intubation (1.39, 95% CI 0.59-3.27; p= 0.446).
Evidence on burden of disease in the long-term care sector
Complementing studies of individual outbreaks, 14 studies provided evidence on the extent to
which long-term care users are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These studies varied widely
in their sampling frame (ranging from nationwide figures to single-centre case series of COVID19 patients), and findings therefore need to be viewed in this context.
Kemenesi et al. report that in Hungary, as of 18 April 2020, 11% of all people with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 in the country came from social homes, all of which were adult nursing
homes.32 Similarly, Raciborski et al. report that 13.3% of all people with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 in Poland up to 30 April 2020 were in nursing homes.65 Prieto-Alhambra et al. found
that 8.9% of 121,263 people with COVID-19 registered in primary care records in Catalonia
(Spain) were nursing home residents.38
Brown et al. found that 6.6% of all nursing homes in Ontario (Canada) had at least one person
who contracted COVID-19 between 29 March and 20 May 2020.42,68 86% of cases were
concentrated in only 10% of nursing homes.

Li et al. also found infections in nursing homes in Connecticut (US) to be concentrated.57 50%
of 215 surveyed nursing homes reported any person who contracted COVID-19. While the
average number of infected people was eight per home, 29% of homes reported more than ten.
Lower staffing levels, higher quality ratings, and higher concentrations of Medicare or ethnic
minority residents were predictive of higher numbers of infected people. Similarly, He et al.
found that 35% of nursing homes in California (US) had at least one person who contracted the
disease, with nursing home ratings and proportion of residents from ethnic minority groups
predictive of COVID-19 infections and deaths.55 Across the US, Abrams et al. found that 31.4%
of 9,395 surveyed nursing homes had at least one documented person with COVID-19.19 Mills et
al. report that 1.3% of all homes for people with intellectual and developmental disability in the
US supported by their organisation (including community-based sites, such as family and foster
care homes, as well as institutional homes) had at least one person with confirmed COVID-19
over a 100-day period, although testing was limited to symptomatic individuals.46
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England conducted a large survey and found that
56% of all care homes catering to people living with dementia and older people had at least one
person who contracted confirmed COVID-19.62 Higher levels of infection among residents were
associated with prevalence of infection among staff, the use of bank or agency nurses, and
different regions. In line with this finding about regional variation, Brainard et al. report that
only 25 of 248 care homes in Norfolk (UK) had any people who contracted COVID-19.53
Detection of any cases was associated with the number of staff not directly involved in personal
care.
Cabrera et al. report the results of systematic testing of all residents and staff in care homes in
Galicia (Spain) and found the prevalence of confirmed COVID-19 to be 3.4% (no breakdown of
these figures by long-term care users and staff was provided).44 263 of 306 care homes did not
have a single person with confirmed COVID-19.
Kim & Jiang found that three of the 12 largest clusters in South Korea were related to long-term
care facilities, including two nursing homes and one psychiatric ward of a long-term care
hospital.33 Das and Gopalan found that 46 out of 3,299 (1.4%) patients with confirmed COVID19 in South Korea from 20 January to 30 April 2020 had been exposed at nursing homes (no
information about whether these were residents, staff, or visitors).24
Gold reports that 20 of 305 (6.6%) of all hospitalised patients with laboratory confirmed COVID
in Atlanta and Southern Georgia (US) were residents in a long-term care facility (study period:
1 to 30 March 2020).28 Also reporting on a cohort of hospitalised patients, Martin-Jimenez et al.
found that 16.3% of deceased COVID-19 patients at their hospital in Madrid (Spain) were
nursing home residents.
Discussion
We report updated findings of a living systematic review of the spread of COVID-19 and
outcomes in long-term care settings. Our findings based on review of 49 studies can be
summarised as follows. First, outbreak reports and studies of wider populations of long-term
11

care users showed the severe impact of the pandemic on this group. Outbreaks at long-term
care facilities can affect more than thirds of residents and lead to the deaths of a little under one
fifth of residents. Excess risk of severe outcomes for long-term care users after contracting
COVID-19 was also found in several studies (including increased risk of death), although not all
studies accounted for case mix, and other studies did not find increased risk for long-term care
users. Second, included studies showed substantial variation in how widely the disease spread
among both residents and staff, and how many residents died as a result of COVID-19 outbreaks
in long-term care facilities. While it is currently unclear what is driving the variation in spread
of disease and outcomes, some outbreaks have been contained successfully, suggesting that
future research should explore the source of this variation to provide urgently needed evidence
to better manage COVID-19 in long-term care. Some of the included studies also provided early
evidence on characteristics of nursing homes predictive of higher numbers of people
contracting COVID-19, which will need to be substantiated through future research. Evidence
on impact of COVID-19 on long-term care in the community is still scarce, even though this
represents a group that is potentially highly vulnerable to infection (as they rely on care from
others) and at risk of severe outcomes.69 Third, a substantial proportion of people with COVID19 detected during systematic screening of residents (as many as 75%) and staff (up to 100%,
although case numbers were very low) of long-term care facilities were asymptomatic at the
time of testing, casting doubts over the appropriateness of symptoms-based strategies in this
setting. Finally, reporting standards of included studies were variable and often poor,
highlighting the need to harmonise research practices and reporting standards in this body of
fast-evolving literature.
Impact of COVID-19 on the long-term care sector
The findings of this living systematic review underline the urgent need for decisive policy action
to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term care sector. The combination of older,
chronically multimorbid people, living in close proximity to each other has contributed to this
population being particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. This vulnerability has been
mirrored in official figures which show that deaths in long-term care users now make up more
than 50% of all COVID-19 related deaths in at least five countries, and more than 30% in 16 of
19 countries reporting relevant data.8
Emerging evidence summarised in this review also shows potentially excessive risk of severe
outcomes, including a higher risk of death, among long-term care residents compared to nonlong-term care residents of similar age. While official deaths data for care homes in most
countries only includes people who either tested positive or had COVID-19 mentioned in the
death certificate, data from England and Wales shows that the number of excess deaths of care
home residents during the pandemic (compared to the number of deaths in the same period in
previous year) was almost double the number of deaths that had been registered as being linked
to COVID-19.8Error! Bookmark not defined. This suggests that current official estimates of
the mortality impact of COVID-19 in care homes in most countries may underestimate the full
impact of the pandemic, be it because of lack of attribution of deaths to COVID, or because of
other indirect effects such as reduced access to usual health care for non-COVID conditions.

This evidence highlights the need to develop targeted policies to both prevent outbreaks in
long-term care settings, and to manage them effectively once they occur. In many countries,
long-term care was not a priority in the early stages of the pandemic. In the UK, whilst
policymakers had been aware of this risk early on in the pandemic,70 inadequacies in the testing
strategy and a focus on ensuring bed capacity in the secondary care sector is likely to have
undermined mitigation of the spread in care homes. Until 16 April 2020, three days after the
peak in daily deaths, it was still possible for UK hospitals to send residents back to their care
homes without having to test them for COVID-19.71
However, policymakers are increasingly aware of the scale of the problem in long-term care and
starting to develop responses. For example, the WHO European Region Office has developed a
list of ten policy objectives to tackle COVID-19 in long-term care, starting with the maintenance
of long-term care services during the pandemic.72 This was recently expanded and updated by
the WHO.73 Individual countries have developed their own set of policy responses, including
implementing national task forces to coordinate responses in long-term care, the use of disease
surveillance tools to monitor outbreaks in care homes and deployment of rapid response teams
to manage them, reducing occupancy in care homes, and policies to increase the number of
available staff.74 Other responses were aimed at preventing the disease entering care homes,
including isolation of care home residents, restrictions or banning of visits, measures to reduce
the risk of disease spreading through staff, and quarantining of residents discharged from
hospital upon re-entering the care home. Importantly, as the pandemic continues over a
prolonged period, attention will need to be paid to ensure continuing care and maintaining the
health and wellbeing of both long-term care users and providers.
Variation in infection rates and outcomes across countries and individual facilities
This review has shown considerable variation in the number of long-term care users and staff
who contract the disease after an outbreak in a facility. In some cases, more than half of the
resident population was infected. In other cases, outbreaks were contained to low numbers or
even preventing a single confirmed infection among residents. Included studies were not
designed to test the effectiveness of different strategies to prevent or contain outbreaks, leaving
open questions about the factors driving the observed variation. Possible explanations for
comparatively low infection rates in individual outbreaks include decisive action to isolate
potentially infected staff members and removing people with confirmed COVID-19 from the
facility,34 cohorting of infected residents,26,29 weekly serial facility-wide testing,26 as well as
hygiene measures and comparatively spacious and more spread-out residents in an assisted
living facility (compared to a nursing home).39 We aim to examine these factors in more detail
in a living systematic review of COVID-19 interventions in long-term care parallel to this one.
In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of different strategies in containing outbreaks, their
impact on the wellbeing of long-term care users and staff should be assessed.
It will be important to design such studies with scientific rigour in order to provide meaningful
and generalisable evidence to guide decision making. The case of experimental administration
of post-exposure prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine for patients and staff at a long-term care
facility in South Korea highlights the need for methodologically robust studies. In the South
13

Korean example, lack of a control group made it impossible to attribute the success in
containing the outbreak (no patient and only one staff member other than the index case were
infected over a 2-week period) to post-exposure prophylaxis.34 In the meantime, a randomised
controlled trial was published and showed no efficacy of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis after
exposure to COVID-19,75 making it appear more likely that strict isolation measures put in place
at the South Korean facility contributed to containing the virus.
A strategy that has increasingly attracted attention is systematic screening of residents and staff
at affected facilities. Our review underlines the importance of diagnostic testing as compared to
symptoms-based screening. Several included studies reported the number of infected people
detected through RT-PCR testing who were asymptomatic at the time. Due to the range in the
number of people who contracted COVID-19 in these studies (4-710) it was difficult to infer a
reliable proportion of those residents that were asymptomatic and yet were found to be COVID19 positive on RT-PCR testing, but included studies suggest that this could be a substantial
minority or even the majority of infected residents (range of asymptomatic cases among
residents at time of testing, 7-78%). For care home staff, the small numbers and sampling
methods to identify people with confirmed COVID-19 made it impossible to make robust
inferences about the numbers of asymptomatic employees. Further information about this
would warrant a more systematic testing strategy across all care home workers and residents.
Indeed, such nationwide comprehensive testing of the care home population including staff is
being conducted in Belgium, showing that 74% of residents who contracted COVID-19 and 76%
of staff who contractred COVID-19 were asymptomatic at the time of testing.76
Some of the included studies also highlighted that people with asymptomatic infections may
develop symptoms within a period of about one week.10,22,26 Future studies should plan to follow
up identified people with COVID-19 to better understand symptoms and apply a more robust
definition of what constitutes symptomatic. Whilst there is seemingly broad agreement with
regards to respiratory symptoms, two studies did not consider gastrointestinal symptoms
(anorexia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting) within their definition of symptomatic.
Consensus may also be needed on a definition of fever; it was interesting to note that two of the
included studies in this review defined fever at 37.3 and 37.8, respectively.22,36
Improvements to reporting of outbreaks
Lack of common standards in the reporting of outcomes has long been recognised as a major
challenge for synthesising research findings.77 In this systematic review, substantial differences
across the included set of studies precluded a quantitative synthesis of results. Studies differed
in how testing was conducted (comprehensive testing vs. convenience samples; varying time
periods over which outcomes data was collected, including infections). We were also unable to
ascertain the homogeneity of different populations due to a lack of reporting of their
characteristics. For example, some of the outbreak investigation reports failed to report
characteristics of long-term care residents, such as mean age, sex distribution, comorbidities,
and ethnicity. In other studies, it was sometimes unclear whether all long-term care users or
staff in the sample frame had been tested, and how testing was conducted. These limitations

highlight the need to establish minimum reporting standards for future studies evaluating
COVID-19 related mortality and spread of disease in LTC settings.
Limitations
This living review had some limitations. First, we extracted the number of people who
contracted COVID-19 as defined by study authors when there was no specific confirmatory
diagnostic test mentioned in the study, which may have overestimated the number of people
with confirmed COVID-19. Second, we also relied on the definitions used by study authors for
deaths due to COVID-19. These sometimes relied on official mortality figures, which share the
limitations of the underlying data sources. Third, we report the proportion of long-term care
users who were hospitalised due to COVID-19 but this is not necessarily an indicator for severity
of disease, as it is likely to partially reflect differences in policies for transferring patients to
acute care hospitals. Fourth, we deviated from our protocol due to the unanticipated large
volume of research identified in this area. Instead of completing all review steps in double, one
reviewer was responsible for study inclusion and data extraction. However, we implemented
broad eligibility criteria in order to ensure no relevant studies were missed, and all studies
deemed eligible for inclusion were reviewed by the same reviewer to ensure consistency.
Conclusions
Long-term care users are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, facing
substantial risk of infection and death. Outbreak reports from individual long-term care
facilities have shown wide variation in the spread of disease and outcomes among residents and
staff. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of
COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care is needed, including for institutional and communitybased services.
