Abstract:

16

Congregate settings and high-density workplaces have endured a disproportionate impact from

17

COVID-19. In order to provide further understanding of the transmission patterns of SARS-

18

CoV-2 in these settings, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on samples obtained

19

from 8 selected outbreaks in Minnesota from March – June, 2020. WGS and phylogenetic

20

analysis was conducted on 319 samples, constituting 14.4% of the 2,222 total SARS-CoV-2-

21

positive individuals associated with these outbreaks. Among the sequenced specimens, three

22

LTCFs and both correctional facilities had spread associated with a single genetic sequence. A

fourth LTCF had outbreak cases associated with two distinct sequences. In contrast, cases

24

associated with outbreaks in the two meat processing plants represented multiple SARS-CoV-2

25

sequences. These results suggest that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can

26

result in a widespread outbreak, and early identification and cohorting of cases, along with

27

continued vigilance with infection prevention and control measures is imperative.

Introduction:

30

COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted adults residing in long-term care facilities

31

(LTCFs) in the United States (1-5). LTCF outbreaks have caused high numbers of

32

hospitalizations and death. Similar findings have been reported in correctional facilities, with

33

SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence among inmates and staff over five times greater and age-

34

adjusted mortality over three times greater than that of the general population (6-8). Workers in

35

high-density workplaces (e.g., meat processing plants) have similarly been heavily affected, with

36

a disproportionate impact on minority populations (9-11).

37

The first identified COVID-19 case in Minnesota was detected on March 6, 2020. Shortly

38

thereafter, COVID-19 outbreaks occurred across the state, including in LTCFs (March 12, 2020)

39

and meat processing plants (March 15, 2020), followed shortly thereafter by correctional

40

facilities (March 25, 2020). From March 6 through June 30, 2020, the Minnesota Department of

41

Health (MDH) identified and responded to 1,060 distinct outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTCFs,

42

comprising 4,421 resident cases and 3,002 staff cases. In addition, there were 4 discrete

43

outbreaks in correctional facilities that resulted in a total of 382 cases, and 68 outbreaks in meat

44

processing plants resulting in approximately 2,616 cases among employees1; outbreaks in these 3

45

settings accounted for 31.3% of all identified cases in Minnesota.

46

For outbreaks in both congregate settings and high-density workplaces, it was difficult to

47

confirm the temporal and relational aspect of SARS-CoV-2 transmission; the role of intra-facility

48

spread versus multiple introductions was difficult to disentangle. Whole-genome sequencing

49

(WGS) of outbreak case specimens can be used to understand transmission dynamics and

50

relatedness of viral pathogens in infectious disease outbreaks (12-15). Unprecedented efforts to

51

sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes have occurred at the local, regional, national and international

52

level in order to investigate potential reinfections (16-19), nosocomial transmission (20), patterns

53

of community spread (21-23), and sources of introduction of SARS-CoV-2 without known

54

epidemiologic links (24).

55

In Minnesota, as part of the CDC SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health

56

Emergency Response, Epidemiology and Surveillance (SPHERES) consortium, the Minnesota

57

Molecular Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 (MN-SOS) initiative solicited outbreak specimens for

58

sequencing and genetic variation analysis to understand viral transmission patterns in congregate

59

settings and meat processing plants. WGS of a convenience sample of SARS-CoV-2 positive

60

specimens associated with outbreaks was performed to supplement epidemiological information

61

and assess whether single or multiple introductions likely occurred during a facility outbreak,

62

and to evaluate molecular relatedness.

63

Methods:

64

Three types of outbreak settings (LTCF, correctional facilities and meat processing

65

plants) were chosen for WGS, with selection of specific facilities based in part on the impact and

66

severity of the outbreak, the need for further clarity regarding transmission patterns, and the

67

availability of samples. Selected outbreaks occurred between March 6 and June 30, 2020 at four

68

unique LTCFs (LTCF A-D), two correctional facilities (Correctional Facilities A and B), and

69

two meat processing plants (Processing Plant A and B), along with identified cases in individuals

70

residing in the same county as Processing Plant A (Community Samples A). An outbreak at a

71

LTCF was defined as ≥1 confirmed COVID-19 case in a resident or staff member. In

72

correctional facilities, an outbreak was defined as 1) ≥2 cases in the inmate population >7 days

73

after intake to a new facility, with an epidemiologic link2, or 2) ≥2 cases in correctional staff

74

with an epidemiologic link3 at the facility, or 3) ≥1 facility-acquired4 COVID-19 cases in an

75

inmate. An outbreak at meat processing facilities was defined as ≥3 laboratory-confirmed

76

COVID-19 cases among workers at a facility who resided in separate households. On June 1, a

77

time component was added to the outbreak definition in meat processing plants, adding that case

78

onset dates are within 14 days of each other. Cases at all outbreak locations were defined as an

79

individual testing SARS-CoV-2 positive by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-

80

PCR) using the original CDC assay protocol (25).

81

Epidemiologic data, including gender, age, symptom status, symptom onset date,

82

residence, occupation, and potential source of exposure were collected via interview with

83

persons having lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.

84

WGS was performed by the MDH Public Health Laboratory (PHL) on available SARS-

85

CoV-2 RT-PCR positive specimens, collected from March 6 through June 30, 2020. Specimens

86

were obtained from the nasopharynx, the anterior nares or oropharynx. SARS-CoV-2 RNA

87

extracts were acquired either as residual from clinical testing at MDH-PHL or other clinical

88

laboratories serving Minnesota residents. cDNA and tiled amplicons were created as described in

89

the ARTIC Network nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol (26). Sequencing Libraries for Illumina

90

next-generation sequencing were prepared according to the Nextera DNA Flex protocol created

91

by the State Public Health Bioinformatics Group (StaPH-B) (27) and sequenced using 2x250 bp

92

Illumina V2 chemistry on MiSeq instruments. Consensus SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences for

93

each specimen were generated with the StaPH-B Toolkit Monroe pipeline (28). Assembled

94

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were individually reviewed in Geneious Prime 2019.2.1 (29) and

95

genomes with gaps greater than 125 nucleotides were discarded.5

96

The Augur toolkit (30) was used for alignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome consensus

97

sequences, phylogenetic tree generation, and incorporation of epidemiological sequence

98

metadata. Genomes were aligned with MAFFT version 7.310 with options “--keeplength --

99

reorder --anysymbol --nomemesave --adjustdirection” (31). Variation in sequences identified in

100

the first 54 and last 67 bases of the Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank: MN908947.3) reference sequence

101

was masked during tree generation due to the inability of the tiled-amplicon sequencing

102

approach to reliably generate sequence in those regions. IQ-TREE version 1.6.1 was used for

103

phylogenetic tree creation with parameters “-ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05” (32). Output from Augur was

104

visualized using Auspice as hosted by the nextstrain team at http://auspice.us/ (30). The resulting

105

trees were visualized with the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) (33) with branch lengths rounded

106

and scaled represent mutations from the reference. Pangolin lineages for all samples were

107

retrieved following submission of assemblies to GISAID (30, 34-35).

108

Genetically closely related sequences (i.e., clusters) were defined as cases which were

109

associated with an outbreak and formed a monophyletic clade on the state-wide phylogenetic

110

tree.

In accordance with federal human subjects protection regulations at 45 CFR §46.101c

112

and §46.102d and with the Guidelines for Defining Public Health Research and Public Health

Non-Research, the project was reviewed by a human subjects protection coordinator at the CDC

114

and in Minnesota DOH and determined to be a non-research, public health response exempt from

115

institutional review board evaluation.

116

Results:

117

WGS and subsequent phylogenetic analysis was successfully conducted on 319 samples

118

associated with the eight outbreaks, constituting 14.4% of the 2,222 total positive cases identified

119

from outbreaks in Minnesota through June 2020. Specimens were obtained from staff and

120

residents from four different LTCFs (180 specimens sequenced out of 505 identified cases,

121

35.6%), staff and inmates from 2 different correctional facilities (110 specimens sequenced out

122

of 544 identified cases, 20.2%) and among employees at 2 different meat processing plants,

123

along with identified community cases (29 samples sequenced out of 1,173 identified cases,

124

2.5%) (Table 1). Among most of the specimens that were sequenced, three LTCFs and both

125

correctional facilities had spread associated with a single genetic sequence unique to each

126

outbreak facility. A fourth LTCF had outbreak cases associated with two distinct sequences. In

127

contrast, cases associated with outbreaks in the two meat processing plants represented multiple

128

SARS-CoV-2 sequences. (Figure 1)

Single Cluster in Long-Term Care Facilities:

130

During the COVID-19 outbreak at LTCF A7 between April 15 and June 11 (Figure 2A),

131

51 of 77 residents, and 38 of 108 health care personnel (HCP) tested were confirmed to be

132

infected, following identification of positive HCP. Specimens from 17 residents (33.3% of cases)

133

and 10 staff (26.3% of cases) were available for WGS. SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences from these

134

27 persons were genetically closely related (Pangolin lineage B.1.2). Viral genomes from two

135

HCP sampled on April 30 and one resident sampled on May 18 at facility A did not cluster with

136

each other or the primary outbreak cluster, though all were a part of the broad Pangolin lineage

137

B.1.

138

In LTCF B from April 29 - June 11 (Figure 2B), 114 of 182 tested residents and 76 of

139

233 tested HCP were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, following identification of a

140

SARS-CoV-2 positive resident on April 29. All 82 sequenced specimens from this facility,

141

including 77 residents (67.5% of cases) and 5 HCP (6.6% of cases), were closely related

142

(Pangolin lineage B.1.116).

143

The first identified COVID-19 case at LTCF C (Figure 2C) was on April 24. Four

144

positive HCP and 3 symptomatic residents were identified by April 30. Throughout May and

145

June, facility-wide testing was implemented, with approximately 941 residents and staff tests

146

performed, with 80 positive residents and 52 positive staff identified. Phylogenetic analysis of

147

the 32 successfully sequenced genomes, including 9 residents (10.8% of cases) and 23 staff (41%

148

of cases) showed 29 of the 32 cases were closely related (Pangolin lineage B.1.2). The remaining

149

three cases (Pangolin lineages B.1 and B.4) were not closely related to each other nor identified

150

with further transmission.

151

Single Cluster in Correctional Facilities:

152

In late March, 2020, an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Correctional Facility

153

A (Figure 3A). The first identified case was an inmate who became symptomatic and tested

154

positive for SARS-CoV-2 on March 25. By March 30th, a total of 7 confirmed cases and 6

155

suspected cases among the inmate population were identified. Between March 30 and April 7, 15

156

staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of the genetic relatedness of the virus from 34

157

inmates (73.9% of cases) and 15 staff (18.3% of cases) from Correctional Facility A were all

158

closely related (Pangolin lineage A.1).

159

In early June, 2020, an outbreak was identified in Correctional Facility B (Figure 3B).

160

The investigation revealed that an employee had developed symptoms consistent with COVID-

161

19 on May 13, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on May 14, and was subsequently excluded from

162

work and isolated at home. Approximately two weeks later, three additional cases, one staff

163

member and two inmates from the same unit as the index patient, tested positive for SARS-CoV-

164

2. A point-prevalence survey (PPS) on June 1 revealed 63 COVID-19 positive inmates among

165

the 87 tested. Subsequent facility-wide testing of both staff and inmates identified cases in other

166

units, 83 new cases in inmates and one new staff case identified among the approximately 2,200

167

persons tested. Phylogenetic analysis of this outbreak among the 1 staff member (0.5% of cases)

168

and 60 inmates (29.1% of cases) at Correctional Facility B shows that all cases were closely

169

related (Pangolin lineage B.1.2) and genetically identical to, or plausibly descended from, the

170

sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the index case.

171

Linking LTCF C with Correctional Facility B:

172

During the epidemiologic investigation at LTCF C, it was learned that a HCP at LTCF C

173

was a household contact of a Correctional Facility B employee. Both individuals became

174

symptomatic at the same time, and both subsequently tested positive in mid-May. SARS-CoV-2

175

genome sequences recovered from these two household contacts were identical to each other,

176

and also to the genomic sequences recovered from 32 inmates at Correctional Facility B (Figure

177

4). In addition, this genomic sequence differs by only a single mutation (G5617T) from 13 cases

178

sequenced from LTCF C.

Two Distinct Clusters in a Long-Term Care Facility:

180

LTCF D (Figure 2D) is a 100 bed facility with approximately 78 residents and 100 staff

181

that experienced an outbreak beginning on April 17, 2020 with a symptomatic HCP.

182

Identification of the first resident and staff case occurred on April 20, 2020, with subsequent

183

testing identifying a total of 53 positive residents and 21 positive staff. While epidemiologically

184

similar to other LTCF outbreaks, an analysis of the genetic relatedness among 39 sequenced

185

cases demonstrated two distinct genetic clusters present in the facility during approximately the

186

same time period. In contrast to the outbreaks in LTCFs A, B and C, viruses from both clusters

187

appeared to circulate simultaneously throughout the facility, each contributing to the outbreak.

188

All sequenced cases from LTCF D belonged to the broad Pangolin lineage B.1.

189

Multiple Clusters in Meat Processing Plants:

190

In early April 2020, an outbreak was detected at Processing Plant A (Figure 5A), a large

191

primary and secondary meat processor. The outbreak at Processing Plant A continued for several

192

weeks until mid-May when the number of cases among workers began to increase rapidly. From

193

March 15 to July 1, there were 446 confirmed cases who reported working at Processing Plant A,

194

including 4 (1%) cases who tested positive in March (management and office staff), 5 (1%) in

195

April, 211 (47%) in May, and 226 (51%) in June. Analysis demonstrated that of the 16 samples

196

(3.7% of cases) sequenced between March 15 and June 3, there were at least 6 unrelated clusters

197

or singleton cases. While the majority of genomes sequenced from Processing Plant B belong to

198

Pangolin lineages B.1, B1.2, B.1.26, one early case is genetically quite different (Pangolin

199

lineage A.1). An interview confirmed that this early case had traveled out of the state during their

200

exposure period (14 days before symptom onset).

201

Between May 15 and June 1, we sequenced samples obtained from eight cases in the

202

county where Processing Plant A is located was performed (Community Samples A). From these

203

eight samples, a total of 5 clusters were identified. Five of the eight samples were closely related

204

with three of the clusters from Processing Plant A, while the remaining three samples formed

205

two distinct clusters. Four of the five sequences from Community Samples A that clustered with

206

sequences from Processing Plant A had sequences that were identical to sequences from

207

Processing Plant A, and all four had no known contact with a verified case.

208

In mid-April 2020, an outbreak was identified among employees at Processing Plant B

209

(Figure 5B), another large meat processing plant. By May 1, there were 649 confirmed cases

210

among workers at Processing Plant B. Sequencing of the 5 available samples from Processing

211

Plant B (0.7% of cases) identified one cluster and two singleton genomes, all belonging to

212

Pangolin lineage B.1.

213

Discussion:

214

WGS identified three primary patterns of genetic relatedness among cases in various

215

outbreak settings: 1) outbreaks where cases were part of a single, genetically related cluster, 2)

216

an outbreak with two unique clusters of cases, each contributing to the outbreak during the same

217

time period, and 3) outbreaks where there were multiple genetically distinct sequences present.

218

Phylogenetic analyses of the viral sequences from available specimens associated with

219

outbreaks in LTCF A, LTCF B and LTCF C were all consistent with at least one primary cluster

220

impacting each facility, suggesting that a single introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into a facility can

221

result in a widespread outbreak. This is similar to previous reports, where WGS has evidenced

222

rapid spread in high density settings as opposed to multiple introductions contributing to the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.20248277; this version posted January 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

223

outbreak (20). Cases from LTCF D, in contrast, formed 2 distinct genetic clusters, one of 17

224

related samples and the other consisting of 22 samples. This is consistent with a potential

225

scenario where there were two separate, independent introductions into the facility, and

226

subsequent parallel intra-facility spread of each individually distinct sequence.

227

Phylogenetic analysis conducted in both LTCF A and LTCF C also demonstrated the

228

presence of “outlier” SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences that were not genetically closely related to

229

the primary cluster in each facility. This suggests community-acquired infection, and subsequent

230

introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility (3). Two of the three outlier cases at LTCF C

231

tested positive over a month after the first identified case. Similarly, two of the three outlier cases

232

identified at LTCF A were identified 10 days after the first identified case, while the third tested

233

positive 28 days later. It is not possible to determine whether these introductions of distinct

234

genetic sequences resulted in additional spread given that WGS characterization was not

235

performed on all positive samples in each facility, and not all HCP or residents were tested.

236

However, the timing of the identification of these outlier cases after the date of the first identified

237

primary case suggest that mitigation strategies implemented after the initial identification of the

238

outbreak, including cohorting strategies, infection prevention and control measures (IPC), and

239

correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) may have been effective in preventing intra-

240

facility transmission of these late outlier cases, as has been previously reported (3, 22-23).

241

WGS identified a different genetic landscape in processing plants, one in which several

242

distinct sequences contributed to the facility outbreak. This finding is despite only 2.5% of

243

positive cases at the processing plants having been sequenced, suggesting that increased

244

sequencing may have identify even greater diversity. Additionally, several genomes identified at

245

Processing Plant A were either identical or closely related to genomes present in the surrounding

246

community (Community Samples A). Six of the eight sequenced Community Samples A were

247

from persons with no known epidemiologic link to a case at Processing Plant A strongly

248

suggesting an unrecognized connection. The benefit of WGS to identify previously unrecognized

249

transmission patterns has previously been established (20, 36). While no definitive conclusions

250

can be made regarding the direction of transmission, WGS provided strong evidence of a

251

worker-community member spread, with communal housing, multigenerational families and

252

group transportation as hypothesized factors potentially contributing to this transmission pattern.

253

WGS has shown to improve understanding of an outbreak upon retrospective analysis (3,

254

20-22), to provide justification for specific public health measures (22-23), and to add insight to

255

transmission patterns in high-risk settings. Our work provides further support for the use of WGS

256

in these situations, while identifying several additional public health implications. WGS has

257

demonstrated that outbreaks in LTCFs and correctional facilities can be the result of a single

258

introduction. Continued vigilance with facility-wide staff screening, and subsequent exclusion of

259

symptomatic HCPs or staff and those with known or suspected contacts is imperative. WGS has

260

demonstrated extensive intra-facility spread, with closely related sequences comprising all or the

261

vast majority of cases contributing to the outbreak. Measures, such as IPC, consistent and correct

262

use of PPE, cohorting of known positive residents and exclusion of positive HCPs must be

263

maintained. WGS has also illuminated the transmission patterns in meat processing plants,

264

including the multiple introductions identified through the multiple closely related sequences

265

identified, and the related community strains. WGS has illustrated the need for community-level

266

mitigation to prevent introductions in high-density worksites, including accessible community-

267

wide testing, housing and transportation strategies, in addition to facility-level measures to

268

prevent unintended introduction into the workplace.

There are several important limitations to this study. First, only a subset of specimens

270

were available for sequencing due to different laboratory specimen retention policies. For

271

example, at LTCF B, samples from only 5 staff were available for sequencing. Similarly, in

272

Processing Plant B, only 5 samples were available due to a clinical testing laboratory protocol

273

that resulted in the discarding of samples after approximately 7 days. In addition, not all

274

available patient samples were able to be successfully sequenced, owing primarily to degraded or

275

low concentrations of viral RNA in the specimen.

276

Another limitation is that not all staff and employees at the LTCFs, correctional facilities

277

and processing plants agreed to be tested. Because of the incomplete genomic picture at each

278

setting, definitive conclusions about single introductions in LTCF A and LTCF D are

279

speculative, and these individual introductions may have actually resulted in some viral

280

transmission that was not identified in the study.

281

Finally, we were not able to present sociodemographic data such as race or ethnicity

282

pertaining to cases, or the facility population, associated with these eight outbreaks in Minnesota,

283

due to limitations in the case investigation process and incomplete case data. This limitation is of

284

particular importance, due to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black, Indigenous,

285

and People of Color (BIPOC). Since BIPOC disproportionately experience incarceration, and a

286

high proportion of meat processing plant employees are persons from immigrant communities,

287

these settings can serve to amplify racial and ethnic health disparities related to COVID-19.

288

Long-term care facilities, correctional facilities, and high-density workplace settings have

289

many factors that are hypothesized to contribute to rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These

290

include insufficient resources and training in IPC, difficulties implementing social distancing due

291

to close habitation and/or work environment, and delayed case detection and access to care (8,

292

11, 37). WGS has demonstrated that many outbreaks in Minnesota were caused by single

293

introductions of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the importance of consistent and correct usage of

294

PPE, rigorous and systematic IPC, environmental control measures, and systematic testing of

295

residents and staff to identify asymptomatic cases. As this pandemic continues, community

296

mitigation strategies and strong enforcement of policies to reduce the risk of introducing SARS-

297

CoV-2 virus into congregate settings are more important than ever. Similarly, IPC and

298

aggressive containment practices are vital to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 upon

299

introduction into a facility. WGS can be a useful tool to supplement epidemiological information

300

and examine the role of facility and community factors contributing to SARS-COV-2 outbreaks

301

in high risk settings.

Figure 4. Phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences associated with both LTCF C
and Correctional Facility B. Filled circles represent sequences taken from inmates or residents,
open circles represent sequences from facility staff or healthcare workers. Sequences from LTCF
F
C are shown on a white background, and sequences from Correctional Facility B on a grey
background. Sequences from two household contacts are noted with stars. IQ-TREE was used
with the general time reversible substitution model for tree generation. Branch lengths were
scaled to represent number of single nucleotide mutations as shown in the scale key.
