COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a recently discovered, novel coronavirus,
SARS-COV2. The disease has led to over 81 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, with close
to 2 million deaths. In the current social climate, the risk of COVID-19 infection is driven
by individual and public perception of risk and sentiments. A number of factors influences
public perception, including an individual’s belief system, prior knowledge about a disease
and information about a disease. In this paper, we develop a model for COVID-19 using a
system of ordinary differential equations following the natural history of the infection. The
model uniquely incorporates social behavioral aspects such as quarantine and quarantine
violation. The model is further driven by people’s sentiments (positive and negative) which
accounts for the influence of disinformation. People’s sentiments were obtained by parsing
through and analyzing COVID-19 related tweets from Twitter, a social media platform
across six countries. Our results show that our model incorporating public sentiments is
able to capture the trend in the trajectory of the epidemic curve of the reported cases.
Furthermore, our results show that positive public sentiments reduce disease burden in the
community. Our results also show that quarantine violation and early discharge of the
infected population amplifies the disease burden on the community. Hence, it is important
to account for public sentiment and individual social behavior in epidemic models developed
to study diseases like COVID-19.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in humans
and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [20, 80]. This
virus was discovered in Wuhan China, in 2019, and has since been declared a pandemic

Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 Dashboard [42], the United States has the
highest cumulative number of cases with nearly 20 million confirmed cases and over 340,000
reported deaths. Brazil has the next highest deaths with with over 190,000 deaths and over
7 million cases. Cases are also rising across Africa; South Africa has the highest number of
confirmed cases: over 1 million cases with over 28,000 deaths. These statistics clearly show
that humans were not efficient in curtailing the spread of the novel virus.
The virus can be transmitted from person-to-person via direct contact with respiratory
droplets or by touching contaminated surfaces and objects containing the virus; the virus
can live on contaminated surfaces and objects [25, 57, 85]. The incubation period for those
exposed to COVID-19 varies from 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus [22, 24, 20].
However, onset of symptoms is often seen earlier in people with pre-existing health conditions
and compromised immune systems. Reports indicate that patients with mild symptoms take
a week or more to recover, while cases that are severe may gradually progress to respiratory
failure, which may lead to death. More serious complications from COVID-19 illness leading
to death are more common in middle-aged and elderly patients who have severe underlying
medical conditions like heart or lung disease, diabetes, or cirrhosis [2]. There is a wide range
of symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19, including fever, shortness of breath, dry
cough, headaches, nausea, sore throat, chest pain, loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, and severe
fatigue [24].
Recently, therapeutics such as Remdesivir have been approved for treatment of hospitalized
individuals; vaccines are being approved but are not yet wildly available and only essential
workers and the elderly are currently being vaccinated [70, 71, 72, 73]. As such, nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, school and event closings, travel
bans, community lockdowns, contact tracing, quarantine of confirmed cases, and the use
of face masks in public are continually being used as mitigation efforts against the virus
transmission. Social distancing guidelines as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) [23] and the World Health Organization [82] state that individuals
outside their homes should be six feet apart from other people and must wear a face-mask
at all times. The use of face masks in public by members of the general population has
historically been a common practice to combat the spread of respiratory diseases, dating back
to at least the 1918 H1N1 pandemic of influenza [14]. The guidelines further recommend that
people frequently wash their hands for at least 20 seconds, even in their homes, as research
has shown that soap kills the virus and reduces one’s chance of getting infected [23]. Infected
individuals and suspected cases are quarantined or advised to self-isolate. However, little
is known about best management strategies for limiting further transmission and spread.
Furthermore, the success of these preventive measures depends on voluntary compliance by
the population [3], and may depend in part to perceptions and interpretations of risk.
The response of individuals in the community to the threat of an infectious disease is
dependent on their perception of risk, which can be swayed by public and private information
disseminated through diverse media. Many individuals use social media platforms like
Twitter, Facebook, and the internet more generally to share social and health information,
and many have used these platforms to also spread misinformation and conspiracy theories.
Many health-related organizations also use these platforms to send information to mitigate
the spread of contagious diseases (like the flu) by educating users on the effectiveness of
regular hand-washing, use of face masks, social distancing, and raising awareness about
vaccines [58]. For instance, in the past decade, the Centers for Disease Control made use
of Twitter in disseminating information on the prevention of flu to help curb the spread of

H1N1 influenza in 2009 [58]. Media reporting is important in the perception, management
and even creation of crises [46, 68]. Information provided to the public through the media
changes human behavior and the population adopts the precautionary measures like the use
of face masks for influenza [43], vaccination [6, 16], and voluntary quarantine [39]. Thus,
the role of media coverage and social media responses on disease outbreaks is crucial and
should be given prominence in the study of disease dynamics.
Our objective in this study is to gain insight into the contribution of human behavior and
public sentiment to the disease spread and not to make explicit epidemiological predictions
and forecasting about the disease outbreak. Here, we use tweets as a source of public
sentiment data and analyze their average parity (i.e., negativeness and positiveness) across
six countries experiencing variations in disease response and spread (Australia, Brazil, Italy,
South Africa, United Kingdom, and United States) during January to May, 2020 time period.
Tweets are short messages limited to 240 characters that are posted in real time by users of
the Twitter social media platform.

The remainder of the work in this paper is organized as follows. In Section , we formulate our
baseline COVID-19 model with human behavior, compute the basic reproduction number
of the model, fit COVID-19 data to the model, and estimate parameters of the model. In
Section , we carry out sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number with respect to
each parameter, and sentiment analysis is carried out in Section . In Section , we incorporate
sentiment effects in our basic model, and present results in Section . Our discussion and
conclusions are presented in Section .

To formulate the COVID-19 model with human behavior where some individuals violate
quarantine rules, we followed the natural history of the infection [59, 84] and segment the
population according to their disease status as susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), asymptomatic
(A(t)), symptomatic (I(t)), quarantined (Q(t)), hospitalized (H(t)), and removed (R(t)).
The equations of the mathematical model are given in equation (1). A flow diagram depicting
the transition from one state to the other as the disease progresses through the population
is shown in Figure 1, and the associated state variables and parameters are described in
Table 1.
The population of susceptible (S(t)) is decreased by infection at the rate β[I(t) + ηA A(t) +
ηQ Q(t)+ηH H(t)], where β is the infection rate; we assume that ηA , ηQ , ηH < 1, meaning that
the asymptomatic, quarantined, and hospitalized are not as infectious as the symptomatic
individuals. Once infected, the susceptible move into the exposed class (E(t)) and a portion
of the exposed population develops clinical symptoms of the disease at the rate (1 − q)σ
and move into the infectious class (I(t)) while the remaining proportion shows no symptoms
and moves into the asymptomatic class (A(t)) at the rate qσ. The symptomatic individuals
either are quarantined at the rate ωQ or are hospitalized at the rate ωH . There have been
several reports of people flouting mandatory quarantine rules [27, 28, 34, 52], so we assume
that individuals in quarantine violate the quarantine rules/laws at the rate νQ . The alarming
rate at which the disease spreads and people require hospitalization, hospitals may become
overwhelmed and could run out of beds, respirators, ventilators, and ICUs [67]. Furthermore,
some hospitals are reserving beds for critically ill COVID-19 patients and discharging to
nursing homes those with less severe illness [8, 36]. Thus, we assume that, due to limitations
in hospital beds, respirators, ventilators, and ICUs, some hospitalized leave the hospitals at

The reproduction number, R0 , is the average number of secondary infectious produced when
a single infected individual is introduced into a completely susceptible population [31, 30].
Hence, COVID-19 can be effectively controlled in the population if the reproduction number
can be reduced to (and maintained at) a value less than unity (i.e., R0 < 1).

Some of the parameters of the model (1) were obtained from literature, while others were
obtained by fitting the model to the observed cumulative case data for each of the six
countries (Australia, Brazil, Italy, South Africa, United Kingdom, and United States) during
January - June, 2020 (see Table 4 in Appendix A). The cumulative case data from the
respective first index case of each of the countries to June 19, 2020 were obtained from
the John Hopkins’ center for systems science and engineering COVID-19 Dashboard [42].
During this time period, these countries instituted lockdowns in March 2020 as a means to

control and contain the disease. Italy instituted a lockdown on March 9, Brazil March 17,
US March 19, Australia March 23, UK March 23, and South Africa March 26 [78]. Thus, the
model was fitted to the two different time periods, the first period is the time before each of
the countries instituted lockdown measures to curtail the virus and the second period is after
lockdown was in place. We obtained two different sets of parameters for some parameters in
each of the time periods; others remained the same, for instance the death rate, the disease
progression rate, the proportion of asymptomatic did not change over this time period.
The fitting was implemented using the standard nonlinear least squares approach with the
fmincon Optimization Toolbox in MATLAB. Figure 2(a) shows the fitting of the observed
cumulative cases for the United Kingdom before lockdown was put in place. The estimated
values of the fitted parameters are tabulated in Table 2. The fitting for after lockdown for
UK is depicted in Figure 2(b) and the estimated parameter values for the other countries
are given in Table 4 in Appendix A.
The numerical value of the reproduction number R0 for United Kingdom before the country’s
lockdown was put in place is estimated using the parameter values tabulated in Table 2.
Consequently, using these parameter estimates, we obtain the value of R0 for the COVID19 outbreak in United Kingdom before lockdown as R0 ≈ 2.75. After lockdown, this value
declined to ≈ 1.50

Sensitivity Analysis
In order to assess the relationship between our model parameters, we use the Latin hypercube
sampling (LHS) technique, which is a scheme for simulating random parameter sets that
adequately cover the parameter space [13, 48, 77]. Uncertainty in model parameters can
be identified through the Latin hypercube sampling technique, coupled with partial Rank
correlation coefficients (PRCCs). We assume that each uncertain parameter is uniformly
distributed within a specified range, which is within ±30% of the respective baseline parameter
values, and performed a Latin hypercube sampling analysis by generating 1000 random
samples from the chosen parameter distributions. PRCCs were then calculated for each
of the following parameters, γA , γI , γQ , γH , δA , δI , δQ , δH , σ, q, β, ηA , ηQ , ηH , ωQ , ωH , νQ , νH ,
and the outcome variable (the basic reproduction number, R0 ). The sign of the PRCCs
indicates whether or not changes in the input parameter has a positive or negative effect on
the corresponding output variable [75, 76]. The most influential parameters of the model are
those that have PRCC values that satisfy |P RCC| > 0.4, where a negative sign indicates an
inverse relationship. The correlation between the output variable and the input parameters
is moderate if 0.2 < |P RCC| < 0.4, and is weak otherwise [19].
Figures 3 indicate that the parameters β, ηA , q, γI , and γA have the greatest impact on the
outcome function (the reproduction number). On one hand, the parameters σ, ηQ , γQ , δA , δQ , δI , ωQ
and νQ have a moderate impact on the reproduction number (the outcome function). The
dominant parameters in increasing the outcome function (R0 ) are the transmission (β), and
the infection modification parameter for the asymptomatic infectious (ηA ). On the other
hand, the dominant parameters in decreasing R0 are the proportion of exposed individuals
developing infections (q), recovery rate of infectious (γI ), mortality rate of infectious (δI ),
the isolation rate of hospitalized and quarantined individuals (ωH and ωQ , respectively).

Sentiment Analysis
In order to carry our the sentiment analysis, tweets from Twitter were downloaded from
January 2, 2020 to May 29, 2020 for six countries, namely Australia, Brazil, Italy, SouthAfrica, United Kingdom, and United States of America, representing different geographical
contexts. These countries and their population composition and political views are diverse,
as are their sentiments about the virus. Different factors drive their sentiments about the
pandemic. For instance, in the United States, a common sentiment is that the virus is a
hoax directed at the ruling party [54, 74]. Media reports about the outbreak are another
factor driving the public sentiment but is being construed as fake news by some people.
In Brazil, the president accused the press of spreading panic and paranoia [12], and called
the virus “a small flu” and urged the people to go to the streets and “face the disease like
men” [12, 37, 69]. Furthermore, the overall sentiment in Brazil is anti-science in nature
where the president had once promoted the use of antimalarial drug hydroxycholoroquine
as coronavirus treatment drug despite lack of evidence that it was effective against the virus
while rejecting social-distancing measures [33, 37].
We used the following procedure to generate sentiment scores for each country using COVID19 tweets. Each tweet contains information including a unique tweet identification number
(i.e., tweetID) and text up to 240 characters as well as meta-information about the tweet
such as user details, geographic origin, user-defined hashtags to categorize the tweet topic,
language, and time of creation. In order to maintain consistency of extracting COVID19 specific content with similar COVID-19 studies using twitter data, the tweetIDs were
extracted from a public repository [26]. These tweetIDs contain validated tweets that include
76 hashtags related to COVID-19 including #COVID-19, #coronavirus, #Corona, #sarscov-2, #Covid19, #SocialDistancing, #quarantinelife, #covididiot, etc. Figure 4 shows
sample tweets downloaded over this time period. As evidenced, negative sentiment may be
specific to the disease, expected behaviors, or the behaviors of other people. In part, this

The process of extracting tweets corresponding to the tweetIDs from the Twitter server
is known as hydration, and was carried out by a verified Twitter developer with a valid
application programming interface (API). The Twarc hydrator package in python was used
to retrieve the tweets with a sleep time of one second between tweets to avoid the 100,000
tweets/day extraction limit set by Twitter. A total of 125.2 million tweets were collected
during January 22 to May 29, 2020 time period and stored in a google cloud platform
(GCP) server with 8GB RAM and 2TB storage. However, less than 1% (983,481 tweets)
of the total tweets downloaded was used, as most tweets do not have country indicator
because very often users do not associate their account to a country and therefore remain

Post data collection, all tweets were translated to English using the googletrans package.
Regular expressions were used for performing data cleaning operations on the tweet texts
including removal of special symbols and filtering out URLs. Sentiment scores for all
tweets were computed using the textblob package [45]. The textblob python package used
to compute the sentiment score for tweets in our study adopts a rule-based approach
for sentiment quantification based on key indicator words present in them. A tweet is
represented as a bag of words. The positive and negative sentiments of a sentences are
based on the weighted average of annotated sentiments to each word in a large corpus. The
sentiment/polarity score varies from −1 to +1, and if it it is < 0, we classify the tweet as

To quantify the overall sentiment in each of the countries, we fitted straight lines (yp and yn
for positive and negative sentiments) through these sentiments; and we took the difference
of the lines yp and yn to determine if the overall sentiment from a country is positive or
negative during the time period the tweets were collected. We see in Figure 6 that Australia
and the United Kingdom are the two most positive countries, their positive sentiment levels
were really high. This is followed by Italy and South Africa which had moderately positive
sentiment. Brazil and the United States of America have more negative sentiments overall,
since they have the least positive sentiment. The European countries, although they were
the first to experience a massive wave of the infection, remained relatively positive.

COVID-19 model with sentiment effects
In this section, we incorporated the public sentiments (positive and negative) into the
COVID-19 model (1) using the fitted straight lines (yp and yn for positive and negative
sentiments). First, we used the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis in Section to
determine the form of the sentiment driven functions.
Each of these six countries instituted lockdown measures as a way to control the spread of
the virus. We expect that as public awareness increases due to increased media coverage
of the infection and the lockdown mitigation efforts that public perception and sentiments
will be positive, therefore leading to a decrease in disease transmission. We therefore expect
the infection rate β to be a decreasing function of public sentiment. However, we see
from the sensitivity analysis that the infection rate β would increase the reproduction
number R0 . Hence, we define a decreasing sentiment function for this parameter. We
also define a decreasing sentiment-related function for νQ and νH since these parameters
increases R0 . However, the parameters ωQ and ωH are defined as increasing function of the
perception-related functions. We have chosen these parameters because these parameters
can be influenced by people’s behavior, perceptions, and sentiments, unlike the recovery
rates, γA , γI , γQ , γH , death rates, δA , δI , δQ , δH , disease progression rate, and the proportion
asymptomatic, q. We discuss below how these functions are obtained for each of these
parameters.
These countries instituted lockdown measures in March 2020 as a means to contain the virus.
For instance Italy, Brazil, US, Australia, UK, and South Africa instituted lockdowns on
March 9, March 17, March 19, March 23, March 23, and March 26 respectively. Therefore, we
define functions that incorporate the values of these parameters before and after lockdown.
Starting with the infection rate β, we define the sentiment-related function βM as

where β0 , β1 are the before and after lockdown infection rates. The variable CI is the

Note that CI is not an epidemiological variable. Furthermore, m induces the effect of public
sentiment on reported cumulative number of infected cases in the community. If m = 0
or relatively small, the infection rates and β are equal or close to the constant β0 . On the
other hand, if m > 0, there is increase awareness about the disease in the community and
the infection rate could decrease to β1 (< β0 ) as the number of accumulated infected cases
increases as shown in Figure 7.

Thus the public sentiment-related functions for quarantine, ω1M , hospitalization, ω2M ,
quarantine violation, ν1M , and early hospital discharge rate ν2M are represented by the
following functions:

νQM

= νQ1 + (νQ0 − νQ1 )e−mCI (t)

νHM

= νH1 + (νH0 − νH1 )e

ωQM

= ωQ1 + (ωQ0 − ωQ1 )e−mCI (t)

ωHM

= ωH1 + (ωH0 − ωH1 )e−mCI (t) .

Note that νQM , νHM , ωQM , ωHM > 0 for CI > 0. We assume that νQ1 < νQ0 , νH1 < νH0 ,
and ωQ1 > ωQ0 , ωH1 > ωH0 . Furthermore, for arbitrarily small number of symptomatic
infectious individuals CI , the sentiment-related transition function νQM converges to νQ0 > 0

for small values of CI the maximum quarantine violation rate out of the quarantine class

lim νQM = νQ1 > 0,

the minimum quarantine violation rate out of the quarantine class as public perceptions and
sentiments effects of the infection manifest in the community.
Similarly, the sentiment-related early hospital discharge rate, νHM , from the hospitalized
class, converges to νH0 > 0, the maximum early discharge rate for small cumulative number
of infectious individuals CI before the onset of public perceptions and sentiments about the
disease, and
lim νHM = νH1 > 0,

The reproduction number, R0T , is the average number of secondary infectious produced
when a single infected individual is introduced into a completely susceptible population.
Next, we simulated the sentiment-related model (6) using the estimated parameters for each
country and plotted in Figure 10(a) the cumulative new cases for each of the countries
and compare the results to the trajectory of the actual cumulative reported cases in Figure
10(b). We see that the sentiment-related model (6) accurately captures the trajectory of the
actual cumulative reported cases; therefore indicating that incorporating public sentiment
into an epidemic model is able to capture the trend in the trajectory of the infection in
the population. Although the model-simulated cumulative number of cases saturates much
earlier than the actual cumulative number of cases; at this point, we are not sure why.
Nevertheless, we are able to realize our goal of understanding the role of public sentiment
in disease spread since we are not using the sentiment-related model (6) to make prediction
about the number of cases.

Results

316

We begin by analyzing the COVID-19 transmission model with quarantine and hospitalization
coupled with public sentiment (described in Section ). Then we analyze the effect of public
sentiment and human behavior on the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 in the community.

In this section, we explore the impact of public sentiments (positive or negative) on disease
transmission in the population. Using sentiment-related functions parameterized with data
from United Kingdom, Figure 11 shows the impact of incorporating public sentiments
in the model against a model without sentiments. We see from Figure 11(a) that the
number of symptomatic infectious individuals in the population is lower when we incorporate
positive sentiment into the COVID-19 model. On the other hand, we see a higher number
of symptomatic infectious individuals in the population when public sentiments are not
included in the model. We also see in Figure 11(b) that negative public sentiments will yield
even more symptomatic infectious individuals in the population.
Thus, we see that it is important to incorporate public sentiment into epidemic models.
Having a clear understanding of the public perception of the risk of the infection and
their sentiments regarding a disease outbreak and its transmission is vital for control and
mitigation efforts.

Impact of human behavior on quarantine and hospitalization
Next, we explore the impact of quarantine and hospitalization on the number of symptomatic
infectious in the population while using the sentiment-related functions parameterized with
data from United Kingdom. First, we double the quarantine and hospitalization rates (ωQ
and ωH ). We notice in Figure 12(a) that the epidemic curve for the symptomatic infectious
individuals shrink (“flatten the curve”) and the peak of the curve shifts from left to right
(as do the time the infection peaks); similarly, the quarantined and hospitalized population
increases and their curves shifts to the right since the rates have been increased. However,
when we double the quarantine violation and early hospital discharge rates (νQ and νH ),
we see in Figure 12(b) the curve of the symptomatic infectious individuals shifts from right
to left and the number of symptomatic infectious individuals increases. We see similar
shifts in dynamics of the quarantined and hospitalized individuals; however, there are fewer
quarantined and hospitalized individuals in the respective classes. It is thus vital to ensure
public compliance and adherence with quarantine rules and to promote positive sentiment
among the populace, as this will go a long way in flattening the epidemic curve.

In this study, we developed a novel compartmental mathematical model to study the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. The model uniquely incorporated human behavior and early discharge
from hospital. The model is further coupled with public sentiments about the disease,
thereby capturing the effect of disinformation. In particular, the model includes violation of
quarantine rules and their positive and negative sentiments regarding the disease. The model
also includes discharge of the infected due to overwhelmed hospital facilities. For instance,
at the onset of pandemic in England, seniors in hospitals were moved back to care homes
[56, 64]. Similarly, at the height of the outbreak in Michigan and New York, hospitals
were discharging the non-critically ill either to nursing homes or simply letting them go
home because the hospital facilities were overwhelmed [15, 63, 51], prompting legislation
in Michigan to protect the seniors and vulnerable members of the community and prevent
nursing homes from admitting patients with COVID-19 [53]. In other places like Arizona,
some nursing homes took in COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms [29].
Public awareness and information is one of the factors driving public perception of risk and
sentiment about the disease [38, 55]. At the onset of the pandemic, many people believed
(unfortunately, many still believe) that the virus was a hoax, along with wide range of other
conspiracy theories about the disease [35, 50, 7, 40, 18, 66]. Many of these misconceptions
and disinformation about the disease were spread on social media platforms like Twitter,
Facebook, etc., which in turn drives public views, opinions and sentiments about the disease
[4, 41]. For instance, Jarynowski et. al. [41] using Twitter was able to capture in Poland
the structural division of the Polish political sphere, identifying the mainstream opposition

and protestant groups, and the possible orgin of disinformation in the country. In Brazil,
the prevalence of misinformation surrounding the pandemic is deeply concerning and many
people blame the messaging from the President Bolsonaro [37].
To measure public sentiments across six countries across different geographical regions, we
downloaded tweets from the Twitter platform from January to May 2020. We then carried
out sentiment analysis that enabled us to separate the public sentiment into either positive
or negative sentiment. While our data set is a multilingual data set across multiple countries,
the filter keywords (i.e., hashtags) are mostly in English. Even though 76 hashtags have been
considered to extract tweets, there exists a possibility of excluding tweets that pertain to
COVID-19 but do not contain any of these hashtags. Even though we have carried out basic
data cleaning and processing tasks, we may have overlooked the small proportion of tweets
that contain regional phrases expressing irony that may not all have been discovered by the
sentiment analysis software program that explores the English translated text. However, a
visual inspection of the texts and the sentiment scores for each tweet across the different
countries showed that the sentiment scores were representative of the tweet sentiment in most
cases, thus ruling out systematic biases in inferences made in this study. The collection,
aggregation, and analysis of more than 100 million COVID-19 related tweets generated
during the time period ensures representation of the general public sentiment across all
sub-populations of each country and not just one region or demographic segment.
Misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories can be really problematic with
tremendous impact on public health efforts to contain the disease in the community. However,
the use of Twitter tweets to measure public sentiment may be limiting and not present the
full picture of public sentiment since public information campaigns might have less impact
on society than expected due to filter “bubbles” observed on Twitter [41]. Hence, it will
be beneficial to diversify the sources of public awareness and information in other to reach
many people as possible [41] and possibly reduce the spread of disinformation.
After obtaining the positive and negative sentiments, we fitted straight lines through the
sentiments in order to determine the magnitude of the sentiments in each of the countries,
see Figure 6. We see that United States and Brazil had the least positive sentiment. The
level of public sentiments in the United States may be due in part to how polarized the
country was in the last four years particularly in the months leading to the 2020 presidential
elections. United Kingdom and Australia had very positive sentiment overall; in the early
days of the pandemic in the UK, the entire country including the royal family applauded the
selfless efforts of the health workers and other frontline workers [9], sharing clips on social
media under the #ClapForCarers hashtag [5, 62].
To incorporate public sentiment into our COVID-19 model (1), we segmented the time period
into before and after lockdown. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the novel coronavirus a global pandemic [79] and shortly thereafter many countries
imposed travel bans from many hotspots and lock-down measures in a bid to curtail and
contain the spread of the virus. Therefore, we defined increasing and decreasing functions
(see Figures 7-9) that incorporated the values of these parameters before and after lockdown
which were informed from the result obtained from the sensitivity analysis (see Figure 3).
Our results showed that preventing the spread of disinformation and negative sentiment
about the disease in the community is important (see Figures 11). Thus, it is essential to
prevent disinformation, and to promote positive sentiment in the community. It is equally

vital to ensure public compliance and adherence with quarantine rules and all mitigation
efforts (see 12). Doing so will go a long way in flattening the epidemic curve, and will lead
to the kind of success story observed in New Zealand [65, 83].
Our study demonstrated that the countries with positive sentiment, and quarantine compliance
have been more successful at curtailing the spread of the disease. In addition, we have
been able to demonstrate the impact on disease burden of early discharge of symptomatic
infectious individuals from hospital to make room for incoming sever COVID-19 patients.
Overall, our model is able to demonstrate the role of people’s behavior and public sentiment
on disease transmission. Although, the trajectory of model simulation in Figure 10(a) is able
to capture the trend of the actual trajectory of the cumulative number of cases in Figure
10(b), our simulation results saturate much earlier. A number of factors may be responsible
for this, which needs to be investigated in a future study.

434

Since we started this study, the number of cases in these countries has exploded, with
some experiencing multiple waves of infections (for instance the United States [17]) and
others are put in another lock-down (France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom
[1, 10, 11, 49, 44]). Although we did not evaluate the sentiment after the lock-down was
lifted, we observed a wave of protests against other mitigation efforts like the use of facemask and vaccines in many of these countries such as US, UK, Australia, Italy, and Canada
[60, 47, 32, 61]. We believe these protests are driven by negative sentiments in the society
against the use of face-masks which subsequently increases the number of infection as we
observed in Figure 11.

To conclude, this study develops a novel model for COVID-19 that uniquely incorporates
human behavior driven by their perception of risk and sentiments about the disease. The
goal of this study was not to make explicit epidemiological predictions about the disease;
rather we hope to provide insight into effects of human behavior on non-pharmaceutical
intervention strategies (such as self-isolation and quarantine) aimed at containing the disease
and public sentiments about the disease. The key findings from this study are summarized
below.
The simulations of the COVID-19 model (6) with human behavior and public sentiment
about the disease show that:
(i) Incorporating public sentiment into an epidemic model is able to project the trajectory
of the disease incidence in the community.
(i) Positive sentiments among individuals in the population reduces the number of infected
and disease burden in the community.
(ii) Negative sentiments among individuals in the community amplify the disease burden
in the community.
(iii) Increasing quarantine, and hospitalization rates decreases the disease burden and
reduces epidemic peak.

455

(iv) Increased quarantine violation rate and early discharged of those still infectious due
to overwhelmed hospital resources increases disease burden leading to early epidemic
peak.

456

This study has shown that incorporating human behavior and public sentiment into epidemic

models is pertinent in order to accurately capture the dynamics and burden of the disease
in the community. We have seen the role quarantine violation plays in disease spread; in a
future study, we will incorporate other kinds of mitigation efforts such as vaccination and
public reactions about them.
