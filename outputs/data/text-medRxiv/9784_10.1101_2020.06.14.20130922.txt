ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Coronavirus Disease of
2019 (COVID-19) patients complicated with venous thromboembolism (VTE)
Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases to find studies
that assessed VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a primary outcome of all-cause
mortality and secondary outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical
ventilation. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of VTE sufferers.
Results: Eight studies have been included with a total of 1237 pooled subjects. Venous
thromboembolism was associated with higher mortality (RR 2.48 (1.35, 4.55), p=0.003; I2
5%, p=0.35) after we performed sensitivity analysis, ICU admission (RR 2.32 (1.53, 3.52),
p<0.0001; I2 80%, p <0.0001), and mechanical ventilation need (RR 2.73 (1.56, 4.78),
p=0.0004; I2 77%, p=0.001). Furthermore, it was also associated to male gender (RR 1.21
(1.08, 1.35), p=0.0007; I2 12%, p=0.34), higher white blood cells count (MD 1.24 (0.08,
2.41), 0.04; I2 0%; 0.26), D-dimer (MD 4.49 (2.74, 6.25), p<0.00001; I2 67%, p=0.009) and
LDH levels (MD 70.93 (19.33, 122.54), p<0.007; I2 21%, p=0.28). In addition, after
sensitivity analysis was conducted, VTE also associated with older age (MD 2.79 (0.06,
5.53), p=0.05; I2 25%, p=0.24) and higher CRP levels (MD 2.57 (0.88, 4.26); p=0.003; I2
0%, p=0.96).
Conclusion: Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased
mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation requirement. Male gender, older age,
higher levels of biomarkers, including WBC count, D-Dimer, and LDH were also being
considerably risks for developing VTE in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease
caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulting
in a global pandemic status. As of this paper writing, it has already claimed more than
400.000 lives and infected approximately 7 million people throughout the world (1). As the
name implies, many aspects of this multifaceted disease are being explored. Notably, the
coagulopathy associated with COVID-19, in which the evidence is still emerging.(2–5)
A previous study has shown that D-dimer, a primary marker of coagulopathy, was
associated with higher mortality.(5) Furthermore, lung dissection and autopsy from COVID-

19 decedents showed pulmonary microthrombi formation.(4,6) Therefore, several authors
argued that Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is the most common
complication of COVID-19, is caused by pulmonary endothelial dysfunction identified as
pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy (PIC) or pulmonary thrombosis.(7,8) This argument is
substantiated by several findings that the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) is more
frequent than deep vein thrombosis (DVT).(9)
Data from multiple studies have shown a higher incidence of venous
thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to other
diseases.(10,11) This acute vascular complication might potentially affect morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. Nevertheless, a retrospective study
conducted by Tang et al. showed that patients with higher D-dimer levels and sepsis-induced
coagulopathy (SIC) scores who received heparin have lower mortality rates.(4) However,
more prospective studies are needed to confirm this result.
Therefore, the study aimed to systematically investigate the outcomes of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients complicated with VTE. We also scrutinized any clinical characteristics
which potentially indicated to developing VTE in this population during hospitalization. With
this study, we want to determine which COVID-19 patients that have the propensity to
develop VTE during hospitalization. Thus, more attention can be given to these patients to
reduce morbidity and mortality during hospitalization.

Methods:
Search strategy
The predefined protocol was used for this review and in line with Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). We systematically searched
and identified studies published between 1 January 2020 and 31 May 2020, through
electronic searches using MEDLINE, Europe PMC, Proquest, Ebscohost, Google Scholar,
Cochrane Central, Clinicaltrial.gov and from preprint websites (Preprint.org and
MedRxiV.org). We used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and free word to construct our
search terms related to venous thromboembolism (venous thromboembolism OR deep vein
thrombosis OR pulmonary embolism), coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 and SARSCoV-2). We identified articles eligible for further review by performing screening of
identified titles or abstracts, followed by a full-text review. In the case of multiple
publications, the most recent and complete report was included. We finalized the systematic
literature review search on 31 May 2020. This study adhered to the PRISMA guideline.

Selection criteria
Articles eligibility was assessed by two independent investigators (JH and ICSP).
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third investigator (AC). The inclusion
criteria of the article in this study included all research studies involving hospitalized
COVID-19 patients experiencing VTE (DVT group and PE group only, non-specified VTE
group, and specified VTE group). We excluded commentaries, non-research letter, reviews,
and case reports/case series.

Data extraction
A standardized form was used to collect the information that consists of qualitative aspects of
identified studies (the first author and publication year, geographic locations, and study
design), COVID-19 patients' profile (gender and age), venous thromboembolisms, and
comorbidities. Two authors performed data extraction independently (JH and ICSP). The
primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes of interest
were intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation. In addition, we also extracted data
regarding clinical characteristics (patient characteristics, comorbidities, sign and symptoms,
and laboratory findings). Data that was reported other than mean ± SD was transformed
accordingly using the formula created by Wan et al.(12)

Statistical analysis
We performed meta-analysis using Review Manager 5.4 (https://training.cochrane.org/onlinelearning/core-software-cochrane-reviews/revman). For dichotomous variables, we calculated

the pooled estimates and its 95% confidence interval in the form of risk ratios (RRs) using
the Mantel-Haenzel formula. We calculated the pooled estimates for continuous variables in
the form of a mean difference (MD) and its standard deviation. To account for interstudy
variability regardless of the heterogeneity, we used a random-effects model. We used twotailed p values with a significance set at 0.05. To assess heterogeneity across studies, we
used the inconsistency index (I2) with a value above 50% or p < 0.05 indicates significant
heterogeneity. We performed a sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out method to achieve
statistical robustness and find the source of heterogeneity. Finally, to qualitatively detect
publication bias, we used an inverted funnel-plot analysis.

Results
Study selection and characteristics
Initial systematic database search yielded 365 studies, of which 192 remain after duplicates
were excluded. Through title/abstract screening, 170 studies were excluded and left with 22
remaining studies. The final 22 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, of which 15 of
them were excluded due to: one was editorial, two were case reports, three were case-series,
one study of PE in non-COVID-19 patients, one study in oupatient COVID-19 patients, and
six studies in ICU admitted COVID-19. As a result, only eight studies (n= 1237 subjects)
were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis.(13–19) (Figure 1, Table 1)

Venous thromboembolism and primary outcome
The initial meta-analysis showed that complication of VTE in COVID-19 patients was not
associated with higher mortality (RR1.63 (0.63, 4.24); p=0.31; I2 64%, p= 0.04). However,
the result was significant after sensitivity analysis was conducted, by excluding one study
(Poyiadji et al.); (RR 2.48 (1.35, 4.55), p=0.003; I2 5%, p=0.35). (Table 2, Figure 2 and 3)

Venous thromboembolism and secondary outcome
Venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with
higher ICU admission (RR 2.32 (1.53, 3.52), p<0.0001; I2 80%, p <0.0001). This result is still
consistent after performing sensitivity analysis by excluding study by Middeldorp et al., in
addition to lower heterogeneity (RR 2.09 (1.38, 3.16), p=0.0005; I270%, p=0.003). (Table 2,
figure 4 and 5) Furthermore, VTE occurrence indicated the more need for mechanical
ventilation support during hospital stay (RR 2.73 (1.56, 4.78), p=0.0004; I2 77%, p=0.001).
A similar expected result, along with reduced heterogeneity, was noted after a sensitivity
analysis was performed, excluding study by Poyiadji et al. (RR 3.35 (2.48, 4.53), p<0.00001;
I2 17%, p= 0.30). (Table 2, figure 6 and 7)

Clinical characteristics associated with VTE
There were 27 variables consist of patient characteristics, comorbidities, VTE risk
factors, signs and symptoms, and laboratory findings have been analysed (Table 3 and Table
4). However, there were only 8 variables associated with VTE, and three of them only
included two studies.
The meta-analysis showed that the incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients were
more common in men (RR 1.21 (1.08, 1.35), p=0.0007; I2 12%, p=0.34). Sensitivity analysis

by excluding one study (Rodriguez) showed that heterogeneity could be reduced while
maintaining significance. (RR 1.25 (1.12, 1.39), p<0.0001; I2 0%, p=0.55) Even though it was
not associated with older age (MD 1.61 (-1.44, 4.66), p =0.30; I2 52%, p=0.04), sensitivity
analysis by excluding study by Poyiadji et al. redirected that older age contributed to
increased risk for developing VTE during hospitalization (MD 2.79 (0.06, 5.53), p=0.05; I2
25%, p=0.24).
Additionally, higher levels of white blood cell (WBC) count (MD 1.24 (0.08, 2.41),
0.04; I2 0%; 0.26), D-dimer (MD 4.49 (2.74, 6.25), p<0.00001; I2 67%, p=0.009) and LDH
levels (MD 70.93 (19.33, 122.54), p<0.007; I2 21%, p=0.28) were also associated with VTE
complications in COVID-19. Sensitivity analysis on D-Dimer by excluding a study by
Poyiadji et al. revealed that heterogeneity can be reduced, an indication of statistical
robustness (RR 3.79 (2.26, 5.31), p<0.00001; I2 39%, 0.16). Higher CRP levels also
associated with VTE after we performed sensitivity analysis by excluding the Rodriguez et
al. study (MD 2.57 (0.88, 4.26); p<0.003; I2 0%, p=0.96). Other parameters including
neutrophils count and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio might be potentially associated with VTE
in COVID-10 (Table 4). However, CRP levels and these variables were only available in two
studies (Figure 7).

Subgroup analysis
We only carried out subgroup analysis consisted of DVT only, PE only, and unspecified VTE
group in correlation to ICU admission. Other subgroup analyses for mortality and mechanical
ventilation were unable to be conducted due to two subgroups (DVT and VTE) contained less
than two studies. As a result, the DVT only group was not associated with ICU admission
(RR 2.47 (0.71, 8.59), p=0.16; I2 54%, p=0.14). Whereas in contrast, higher ICU admission
were significant in the PE only group (RR 1.75 (1.13, 2.69), p=0.01; I2 74%, p=0.009) and in
unspecified VTE group (RR 5.50 (2.09, 14.49), p<0.00001; I2 0%, p=0.39). However,
considerable heterogeneity between subgroups was noted (I2 75.9%, p=0.02). (Figure 8)

Publication bias
We did not perform publication bias in accordance to the Cochrane handbook reference
which stipulates that the power of inverted funnel-plot analysis is too low to discriminate the
chance from real asymmetry if the included studies are less than 10.(21)

Coagulopathy and VTE in COVID-19 are an emerging phenomenon with devastating
consequences and has been associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19.(22,23) Thus, it
prompts International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) to publish interim
guidelines for managing COVID-19’s coagulopathy.(24) They recommend that all
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, should be prophylactically anticoagulated.
The underlying factors contributed to VTE according Virchow’s triad, which are
venous stasis, activation of coagulation, and vascular dysfunction.(25) The first factor,
venous stasis, is common due to immobilization in hospitalized patients, especially patients
that reside in the ICU. Nonetheless, the incidence of VTE in ICU-admitted COVID-19
patients were higher compared to other diseases.(10,11)
The other two factors are culmination of COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 can
infect different organs through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a glycoprotein
metalloprotease that are ubiquitously found in human organs, particularly the endothelial
cells, which traversed multiple organs and the pneumocytes.(26,27) The ensuing hypoxia
caused by lung injury and ARDS in COVID-19 is a key factor of vascular fibrin deposition
due to the increased early growth response-1 (Egr-1), which triggered tissue factor
transcription/translation by mononuclear phagocytes and smooth muscle cells.(28)
Furthermore, there is a role of bidirectional immunothrombosis, which is heightened
inflammation will shift the balance to the procoagulant state by downregulating necessary
anticoagulant pathways, while upregulating tissue factor expression necessary for thrombin
generation.(29)
In addition, SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE-2 after successfully infected cells,
which is a counterregulatory enzyme of Angiotensin II (AngII) that maintains the reninangiotensin system (RAS) balance in check.(30) This condition leads to a prothrombotic
milieu. Interaction of AngII with angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR-1) will activate
transcription factors, which increased adhesion and accumulation of neutrophils and
macrophages to endothelial cells, and ultimately these cells will release proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines.(30,31) All of these will preserve the vicious cycle of
inflammation and coagulopathy.
SARS-CoV-2 is also known to cause direct vascular injury via ACE-2 receptors. Case
series of post mortem analysis of decedents due to COVID-19 confirmed diffuse endothelial
inflammation, termed endothelitis, viral elements within endothelial cells, and inflammatory
cell death.(32) Furthermore, morphologic and molecular changes from autopsied decedents
due to COVID-19 ARDS showed severe endothelial injury with viruses present

intracellularly and disrupted cell membranes.(33) Another hallmark feature was thrombosis
and microangiopathy and intussusceptive angiogenesis, which was nine times and 2.7 times
more common than patients with influenza.(34)
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that
describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with VTE in COVID-19
patients. The meta-analysis has shown that VTE was significantly associated with mortality
compared to the non-VTE group after sensitivity analysis, by excluding Poyiadji et al. Of
note, higher all-cause mortality was seen in non VTE COVID-19 patients in this study.
This finding is in accordance with a study from China by Wang et al., involving 1026
subjects with laboratory-positive COVID-19 that showed a high risk of thromboembolism,
defined as Padua score of ≥4, which is significantly associated with mortality.(35) Despite
pooling mortality risk ratio across all VTE phenomena, which might introduced bias due to
mortality disparity between PE only group and DVT only group, a study by Zhang et al.
showed that COVID-19 patients with DVT had significant risks of developing adverse
outcomes consist of more ICU admission (p=0.005), fewer hospital discharges (p<0.001),
and more deaths (p=0.001).(18) Thus, it is justified to include DVT under the same umbrella
term of VTE with PE. Furthermore, Wang et al. also showed that these patients were more
likely to have been admitted to the ICU.(35) We also find this association to be true. In
comparison to the non-VTE group, the VTE group was significantly associated with higher
ICU admission. Also, our data showed that VTE patients were likely to be mechanically
ventilated, confirming aforementioned study.(35)
However, it is worth mentioning, that one of the included studies highlighted that
72% pulmonary embolism cases was diagnosed in patients who do not need ICU level
care.(15) In addition, Rodriguez et al. reported that asymptomatic DVT was diagnosed in 23
out of 156 patients (14.7%).(17)Thus, special attention is needed for asymptomatic or
ambulatory COVID-19 patients.(22)
It is well known that worse clinical presentations of COVID-19 disproportionately
affect the older population and male gender. However, the pathomechanisms remain elusive.
In our meta-analysis, the male gender was associated with VTE. This result might explain, in
part, why males were disproportionately affected. Nonetheless, men do have a higher risk of
first and recurrent VTE compared to women, and it is hypothesized due to X or Y link
mutation or mutation on a gene with a sex-specific effect.(36)
In our meta analysis, VTE was associated with the older population after we
performed sensitivity analysis, by excluding Poyiadji.(15) In his study, VTE occured in

younger patients. Younger populations in VTE sufferers were also noted in studies by
Artifoni et al. and Rodriguez et al.(13,17) However, it is important to keep in mind that
analysis from a population-based study of 25 years involving 2218 patients, with increasing
age, there is a marked increase in VTE incidences in both sexes.(37)
Previously, a meta-analysis by Tian, et al. found that higher WBC count, D-Dimer,
CRP, and LDH levels were associated with mortality in COVID-19.(38). These biomarkers
serve as an indicator of heightened inflammation and organ damages. Thus, in the setting of
marked inflammation, the bidirectional role of immunothrombosis plays a crucial part in
VTE's pathomechanism. In our meta-analysis, higher WBC count, D-Dimer, CRP, and LDH
levels were associated with VTE. However, the CRP variable gains significance after we only
included two studies.(table 4) Therefore, more prospective studies are needed to better
understand the relevance of CRP levels as a risk marker .
On the other hand, our meta-analysis did not yield any association between VTE and
comorbidities. Therefore, another likely explanation of why there is a higher burden of
COVID-19 in patients with comorbidities.(30,39) Furthermore, it is not surprising that
symptoms and signs other than dyspnea were not associated with VTE. Also, dyspnea in
COVID-19 is not adequately sensitive to distinguish pulmonary embolism (VTE spectrum)
from the lung injury, which is the main target organ of SARS-CoV-2.
We did not find any association between platelet count and VTE, confirming findings
that coagulopathy in COVID-19 is a distinct entity compared to disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC).(40) The thrombosis phenomena in COVID-19 occurred on an earlier
phase, thus do not reflect the state of consumptive coagulopathy.(7,9,41,42)
Finally, we can not confirm other analyzed variables that were and were not
associated with COVID-19 due to only including two studies. Thus, more prospective studies
are needed.

Limitations:
This systematic review and meta-analysis have several limitations. First, although the total
subjects pooled from eight studies were adequate (n= 1237 subjects), it is worth noting that
the reported VTE phenomena are not homogeneous. Two studies reported VTE, four studies
reported PE only, and two studies reported DVT only. Second, not all of the studies reported
the outcome of interest (mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation). Thus, we can
only perform a subgroup analysis for ICU admission. Third, due to many missing data from
included studies, more studies are needed to confirm meta-analysis findings that consisted of

two studies. Thus, we can not fully elucidate the representative clinical characteristics
associated with VTE in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, most of the studies were from western
countries, so findings may not be generalizable for other populations. Finally, the included
studies were predominantly retrospective design.

Conclusions:
Venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 contributed significantly to higher inhospital mortality, ICU admission and the need of mechanical ventilation. Additionally, male
gender, older age, as well as higher levels of WBC count, D-Dimer, and LDH were
associated with increased risks of developing VTE in COVID-19.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and mortality.
Caption. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between the VTE group and the nonVTE group.

Figure 3. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and mortality.
Caption. After excluding one study (Poyiadji et al.), the COVID-19 with VTE was associated
with higher all-cause mortality.

Figure 4. Venous thromboembolism and ICU admission.
Caption. ICU admission is higher in COVID-19 patients with VTE compared to the non-VTE
group.

Figure 5. Venous thromboembolism and ICU admission.
Caption. After excluding one study (Middeldorp et al.), the heterogeneity can be reduced
while maintaining significance.

Figure 6. Venous thromboembolism and mechanical ventilation.
Caption. COVID-19 patients complicated with VTE were associated with higher need of
mechanical ventilation.

Figure 7. Venous thromboembolism and mechanical ventilation.
Caption. After excluding one study (Poyiadji et al.), the heterogeneity can be reduced while
maintaining significance.

Figure 8. Subgroup analysis of venous thromboembolism and ICU admission.
Caption. COVID-19 patients complicated with PE and VTE, were associated with higher
ICU admission. However, considerable heterogenity and subgroup differences were noted.
