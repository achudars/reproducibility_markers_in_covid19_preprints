Key points
Question: What is the diagnostiv value of the cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection?
Findings: We confirmed, in a community-based setting, that the presence of a rash is predictive of SARSCoV-2 infection, and provided a large library of cutaneous manifestation photos to help healthcare
professionals in diagnosing COVID-19.
Meaning: Skin rashes should be considered as part of the clinical presentation of COVID-19 to aid earlier
diagnosis and curb the spread of the infection.
Abstract
Importance: SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple immune-related reactions at various stages of the disease, and
the wide variety of cutaneous presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had
attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of COVID-19 rashes but were mostly based on hospitalized
severe cases with limited follow up.
Objective: To assess the diagnostic value of new skin rashes in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Design: Observational study including data collected longitudinally via the COVID Symptom Study app
between May 7th and June 22nd, 2020, as well as data from an independent online survey on skin-related
symptoms.
Setting: Community-based
Participants: Volunteer sample of 336,847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app and 11,546
surveyees, aged 1 to 90 years old.
Exposure: Users self-reporting a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 swab test result, untested symptomatic
users, and survey respondents.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): the diagnostic value of new skin rashes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
observation on their duration and timing in relation to other COVID-19 symptoms
Results: In the app data, 8.8% of the swab positive cases (N=2,021) reported either a body rash or an acral
rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (N=25,136). Together, these two cutaneous
presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-1.97) for being swab
positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users
(N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classic COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever,
persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from the independent online survey showed
that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was
the only clinical sign.
Conclusions and Relevance: Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a
positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other symptoms.

Recognising rashes is important for the early detection of COVID-19 cases. To help healthcare
professionals in this task we have established a large library of high-quality manually curated photos,
available at: https://covidskinsigns.com
Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whilst mainly targeting the
lungs, also affected other organs1. Cutaneous manifestations were slower to be reported, possibly because
in patients in critical conditions the need for documenting cutaneous changes was less pressing, and because
the diversity of the associated skin changes may have delayed their initial association with COVID-19
infection2. The first cases of COVID-19 cutaneous manifestation were documented in China, but prevalence
was very low at 0.2% in 1,099 hospital cases3. Italy then reported that 20% of the patients on a COVID-19
ward (N=88) had cutaneous signs4. Subsequently, other groups2,5–9 have described urticarial rashes,
vesicular lesions and less frequent cases of chilblains affecting fingers or toes (acral rash), thought to be
due to minor thrombotic events or damage to the endothelial walls of small distal vessels of the digits.
Here, using a population approach, we investigated the diagnostic value of body and acral rashes for SARSCoV-2 infections using data from 336,847 users of the COVID Symptom Study app, and from an
independent survey on COVID-19-related cutaneous symptoms in 11,546 subjects, 2,328 of whom also
shared photos of their skin complaints.
Methods
The COVID Symptom Study app
The COVID Symptom Study app10 was developed by Zoe Global Limited, supported by physicians and
scientists at King’s College London and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, and was first launched
in the UK on March 24th, 2020. Participants were recruited through social media outreach or invitations
from the investigators of long-running cohort studies to their volunteers within the newly established
COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) Consortium10. The study population includes anyone able
to download the app, either themselves or by proxy. The app collects on sign up, data on sex, age, ethnicity
(i.e., Asian, Black, Chinese, Middle East, Mixed, or White), core health risk factors, including height,
weight, and common disease status (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart, kidney, and lung disease), the use of
medications (e.g., corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and blood pressure medications). It also records,
whether the user is a healthcare worker. From May 7th, 2020, users were prompted to self-reportif they
had ever had a SARS-CoV-2 test. how it was performed (e.g., nose/throat swab, antibody testing), and the
result (i.e., positive, negative, failed, or waiting). Users could provide daily updates on their health status
and the presence of up to 14 COVID-19-related symptoms: abdominal pain, chest pain, delirium, diarrhoea,

fatigue, fever, headache, hoarse voice, anosmia, persistent cough, shortness of breath, skipped meals, sore
throat, and unusual muscle pains. From April 29th, 2020, two cutaneous manifestations were also added:
raised, red, itchy wheals on the face or body or sudden swelling of the face or lips (body rash), and
red/purple sores or blisters on the feet or toes (acral rash).
Study population
This study included residents in the UK aged from 1 to 90 years who downloaded the app and entered
regular data between May 7th and June 22nd, 2020, either themselves or via proxy. We excluded users with
body mass index (BMI) outside the range of 15 to 55 kg/m2 (for users 16 years old or older) or outside two
standard deviation from the sample’s mean for each age (for users younger than 16 years old), pregnant
women, and users who did not report their sex (Supplementary Figure 1). We removed inconsistent daily
assessments, such as those with a logged body temperature outside the range of 35 to 43°C, or where users
reported feeling unwell but had no symptoms. This resulted in 336,847 users, 17,407 of whom also provided
valid (i.e., positive or negative) results for SARS-CoV-2 swab tests (hereafter: “tested users”). We further
selected 54,652 symptomatic users (i.e., users reporting at least one of the 16 collected symptoms during
their daily log history) who did not consider themselves of having been already infected when first
registering with the app and were not tested via nose/throat swab (hereafter: “symptomatic untested users”).
These were divided in two groups: those reporting at least one of the of the three main symptoms of COVID19 (i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, hereafter: “classic symptoms”) either at the time of logging
or in retrospect, and who, according to the NHS guidelines, would require isolation and testing, and those
who did not (Supplementary Figure 2).
The skin rash survey
To collect more detailed information on body and acral rash duration and timing with respect to other
COVID-19 symptoms, and to create a repository of photos for COVID-19-related cutaneous symptoms, we
delivered an independent online questionnaire via Survey Monkey, asking whether the rash was the only
symptom, how many days it lasted, and, if other COVID-19-related symptoms were present, whether the
rash started before, during or after them. Participants were recruited through social media outreach.
The questionnaire was open from 12th to 17th June, 2020, and 29,966 individuals participated. We removed
18,422 surveyees not reporting their sex, age, the duration of their cutaneous symptoms, or reporting
symptoms lasting more than six weeks, or being outside the 1-90 years old range (Supplementary Figure
3). Of the 11,544 surveyees passing this quality control, 2,328 uploaded a photo of their rash, and gave
consent for sharing. From these, we randomly selected 260 photos from both sexes, with either a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test or reporting at least one of the three classic symptoms. The 260 photos were blindly

assessed and independently categorised by four experienced dermatologists. Classifications were accepted
when at least three dermatologists agreed on the diagnosis.
In collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists, the complete photo database was
subsequently examined by four consultant dermatologists, and about 400 photos were classified by
consensus to create a large library of curated photos divided in several types of rashes.
Ethical statement
The study has been approved by the King’s College London Research Ethics Committee REMAS ID 18210,
review reference LRS-19/20-18210. All app users and surveyees provided informed consent, either
themselves or by proxy. Additional consent was sought for the sharing of the uploaded photos with
researchers, healthcare professionals, and journalists for publication purpose.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out using R (v3.6.1). To identify confounders, comparisons between
categorical and continuous values were carried out using Pearson's χ2 test and Wilcoxon’s test, or linear
regression, respectively. Associations between the presence/absence of self-reported skin-related symptoms
and, in tested users, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and, in symptomatic untested users, the presence/absence of
the three classic COVID-19 symptoms, were carried out through multivariate logistic regression, and the
following variables, identified in the previous analysis, were included as covariates: sex, age, BMI,
ethnicity, smoking status (never, ex, current), common disease status (diabetes and lung disease) and
whether corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or blood pressure medications were administered.
Associations passing a Bonferroni-derived threshold of 0.05/2 (body rash and acral rash)=0.025 were
considered as significant. Sensitivity analyses were carried out by stratifying for sex, ethnicity, and being a
healthcare worker.
Results
The majority of the 336,847 UK users of the app who registered between May 7th and June 22nd 2020 and
were included in this study were white European (94.0%). Results for SARS-CoV-2 swab tests were
provided by 27,157 users (8.1%), 2,021 of whom (7.4%) were positive. Among untested users, 54,652 were
symptomatic (i.e., reported at least one of the 16 collected symptoms), including 17,371 users presenting
with at least one of the three symptoms of COVID-19 (i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia) whose
presence, according to the UK NHS guidelines, would require isolation and testing. While these guidelines
are not diagnostic, the presence of any of these three symptoms associates in our data with SARS-CoV-2
positive swab with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.69 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 5.13-6.31, P=5.12x10-282),

indicating with good confidence an enrichment for infected subjects. Sample characteristics are summarised
in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1
Skin-related symptoms were reported by 6,403 users, including 1,534 tested users, and by 3,672 untested
symptomatic users. Among the 2,021 users who tested positive on swab test, 178 users (8.8%) reported
skin related changes. Of those, 138 (6.8%) reported body rashes and 62 (3.1%) acral rashes (Table 1). Only
22 (1.1%) of them reported both acral and body rashes. Infected users reporting acral rashes were slightly
older (mean age = 50.2) than those who did not (mean age = 43.7; Wilcoxon’s test P=6.3x10-3).
Additionally, prevalence of body rashes was slightly higher among females (OR=1.60, 95% CI=1.08-2.44,
P=0.02). We did not observe any significant age difference for body rashes or sex difference for acral rash
prevalence (P>0.05).
Similar skin symptoms were also seen in untested symptomatic users: 1,429 (8.2%) users reporting any of
the three classic symptoms also reported a rash, compared to 6.0% for those who did not (OR=1.32, 95%
CI=1.23-1.42, P<4.7x10-15).
Association analysis highlighted higher prevalence of either body or acral rashes among users who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those who tested negative (OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.42-1.97, P=1.1x109

). The subtypes were similar: body rashes were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positive swab with an OR

of 1.66 (95% CI=1.37-1.99, P=1.1x10-9), whereas the OR for acral rashes was 1.74 (95% CI=1.33-2.28,
P=5.9x10-5). In comparison, the odd ratio for fever was 1.48 (95% CI=1.31-1.66, P=4.3x10-11). Sensitivity
analyses confirmed the reported odds ratios (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Figures 4
and 5). The comparison between 17,371 symptomatic untested users who reported at least one of the classic
symptoms and those who did not yielded an OR of 1.46 (95% CI=1.35-1.58, P=1.9x10-20) for body rash,
while the association with the rarer acral rash was not significant (P=0.21). We could not assess whether
ethnicity affected the prevalence of cutaneous symptoms as the number of non-European users with skin
symptoms was too low (Supplementary Tables 1, 2, and 3, Supplementary Figures 4 and 5).
To better investigate the duration of skin rashes and their timing in relation to other COVID-19 symptoms,
we collected data from 11,544 individuals who responded to an independent on-line survey on possible
COVID-19-related skin rashes. Median age was 53 years old (1st-3rd quartile: 41-63), 77% were female.
Among surveyees, 694 reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab or antibody test, and 3,109 were untested
but reported having had one of the three classic symptoms. Photos of rashes were shared by 2,328 surveyees,
and 260 photos were randomly selected to be assessed by four experienced dermatologists, who divided
them in five common categories (i.e., papular, urticarial, vasculitic body, livedo reticularis, and acral
lesions). We discarded 52 photos (20%) rejected by at least one dermatologist because the image was
blurred, or the area photographed was too small to evaluate, or the person in the photo could be de-

anonymised. Out of the 208 good quality photos, 30 were judged as not attributable to SARS-CoV-2
infection (e.g., acne, shingles, molluscum contagiosum, pompholyx eczema, peri-oral dermatitis, impetigo,
or tinea, 14.4%), and 18 were discarded due to a disagreement in diagnosis between dermatologists (8.7%),
resulting in 160 photos used in the subsequent analyses. Notably, when asked whether a photo showed a
COVID-19-related skin rash, the four dermatologists agreed 82.2% of the times, and three out of four
dermatologists agreed 95.7% of the times. The three most common presentations were papular rashes
(including erythemato-papular and erythemato-vesicular types, 41.2%), urticaria (30.0%), and acral lesions
(23.1%). Overall agreement for acral lesion, and urticaria were 96.6% and 80.9%, respectively. Papular
rashes showed the lowest agreement (76.4%), possibly because some the papular rashes may be more subtle
and more difficult to photograph. Examples of COVID-19 cutaneous manifestation are show in Figure 1
and Supplementary Figures 6-8, while a large curated library of 400 high quality photos collected via the
survey is available at https://covidskinsigns.com/.
The average duration of cutaneous rash was 13 days for acral lesions, 14 days for papular, and 5 days for
urticaria (significantly shorter duration; Wilcoxon’s P<2.2x10-6, Figure 2).
The 694 surveyees that reported having tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 via a swab or antibody test, with
cutaneous signs, also reported other COVID-19-related symptoms, fatigue (11%), headaches (9%), loss of
smell (9%), fever (7%), muscle pain (6%), shortness of breath (6%), and persistent cough (6%) being the
most common. Interestingly, while most surveyees declared skin changes to appear at the same time as
other COVID-19 symptoms (47%) or afterwards (35%), in 17% of the cases skin symptoms appeared before
any other symptoms, and in 21% of the cases the rash was the only symptom. Similar estimates were
obtained when focusing on the 3,109 symptomatic untested subjects, where 47%, 39%, and 15% surveyees
declared to have had cutaneous rash during, after, and before any other symptoms, respectively.
Discussion
COVID-19 is now known to have varied clinical manifestations and to target multiple organs, including the
skin1–3. COVID-19 rashes may present in many forms and at different stages of the disease. The
heterogeneous presentations and the focus on severely ill patients during the early phases of the pandemic,
led to the skin being overlooked as an important target organ for SARS-CoV-2.
In this community-based study, 8.8% of positive COVID-19 cases via swab tests also reported skin rashes
(OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.42-1.97). Body rashes were more frequent than acral lesions (6.8% vs 3.1%) although
their predictive value was similar (OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.37-1.99 vs 1.74, 95% CI=1.33-2.28, respectively).
Interestingly, the odds ratio for both types of rash was greater than for fever (OR=1.48), a widely used
criteria to suggest testing. Reports of cases with both body rashes and acral lesions were rare, suggesting

different pathogenesis, with the former caused by immunological reactions to the virus, and the latter more
likely explained by delayed small thrombotic occlusions or damage to vessel walls2.
The use of the app has been valuable to document the presence of different types of COVID-19 symptoms
in the community11,12. However, data on cutaneous symptoms were only recently collected, and this
hindered our ability to identify at which stage of the disease they appear and how long they last. An
independent survey was therefore carried out to capture more details on the types of rashes including photos,
their duration, timing, results from SARS-CoV-2 swab/antibody test, and co-occurring symptoms. The
prevalence of the different types of rashes was assessed by four dermatologists using uploaded photos. This
showed that papular rashes were the most frequent, and that urticaria was short lived.
The survey also showed that in 17% of the positive surveyees skin rash was the first symptom to appear, as
already observed in two case reports8,13, and importantly in 21% of them it was the only symptom, and a
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis would have been missed if using either the UK NHS or the US CDC criteria alone.
Limitations
A major limitation of this study is the self-reported nature of the data. However, we believe that the presence
of a rash, especially if symptomatic, is less subjective and more specific than other symptoms such as
fatigue, headaches, or persistent cough. Of the photos uploaded by the surveyees and blindly assessed by
four dermatologists, only 14% were classified as definitively non-COVID-19-related dermatological
conditions, suggesting that the large majority of surveyees (86%) were able to self-identify cutaneous
manifestation likely to be related to COVID-19 infection. This may mean that the total number of COVID19-related skin rashes self-reported through the app and the survey may have been slightly overestimated.
On the other hand, many of the app users may have failed to realise the relevance of cutaneous symptoms
and not have reported them if not accompanied by other more known COVID-19 symptoms. Given the very
large number of users of both the app and the survey, we are confident that potential errors deriving by the
analysis of data reported by 336,847 users are likely reflected by larger standard errors of the estimates,
rather than on the point estimate of their effects, as already postulated in other large and successful biobank
resources (e.g., the UK Biobank), which are also based on self-reported health-related data. Second, our
study sample is not fully representative of the general population, as it represents a self-selected group of
individuals, and also because of the uneven access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in the early stages of the
pandemic, with tested subjects encompassing a mixture of healthcare workers, at-risk subjects with chronic
diseases, elderly people, etc. Our study sample is also composed predominantly by white individuals, and
with a larger proportion of females and younger individuals compared to what was observed in hospital
settings. Third, although COVID-19 rashes can be divided into three main types, i.e., urticarial, erythemato-

papular/vesicular, and chilblains/perniosis on acral sites, the app only classified them into two categories,
with the urticarial rash and erythemato-papular/vesicular rashes together, as both tend to be itchy and the
users may not be able to differentiate between them. Moreover, we did not consider rare dermatological
presentations, because the main aim of this study was not to provide an exhaustive description of SARSCoV-2 cutaneous manifestations but to raise awareness of the high prevalence of common COVID-19
rashes, which can sometimes appear earlier than other COVID-19 symptoms or be the only symptom. To
this purpose, we have further developed a large library of curated photos to help GPs and healthcare
professionals not specialised in dermatology to recognise the most common categories of COVID-19 rash.
Conclusions
The NHS in UK lists three main symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 (www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronaviruscovid-19/symptoms), whilst the CDC in the USA lists eleven (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). However, these do not currently include any skin-related
symptoms, although they can be easily spotted by patients. Importantly from the survey reported in this
study, it was the only presentation in one fifth of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
This study strongly supports the inclusion of skin rashes in the list of suspicious COVID-19 symptoms.
Although, it is less prevalent than fever, it is more specific of COVID-19 and lasts longer. An increased
awareness from the public and healthcare professionals regarding COVID-19 skin changes will allow more
efficient dectection of infection and contact tracing. It is important to increase awareness of the rashes
associated with COVID-19 infection. We have established a large library of high quality manually curated
photos, available at: https://covidskinsigns.com, to help healthcare professionals to identify COVID-19related dermatological conditions.

Figure 2. Duration of symptoms. Distribution of symptom duration is shown for the three most common
cutaneous symptoms diagnosed from the selected photos. P values were generated by means of the
Wilcoxon’s test.

Table 1. Sample characteristics. Categorical values are reported as number and percentage, and compared using Pearson's χ2 test. Continuous values are
reported as mean ± standard deviation and compared using Wilcoxon’s test. Associations P values with body and acral rash are from multivariate logistic
regression, adjusted for the relevant covariates (Methods), and with BMI from multivariate linear regression, adjusted age and sex. “Users tested for SARSCoV-2” refers to users self-reporting a positive or negative swab test result. “Symptomatic untested users” refers to users who reported at least one of the

16 collected symptoms, did not believe that they had already had COVID-19 when first registering with the app, had not yet been tested for SARS-CoV-2.
“Classic symptoms” refers to those included in the NHS guidelines (i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia).
