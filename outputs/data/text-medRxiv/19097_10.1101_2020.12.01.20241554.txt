ABSTRACT

24

Background

25

Relative to the rest of Europe, the UK has relatively poor cancer outcomes, with late diagnosis and a slow

26

referral process being major contributors. General practitioners (GPs) are often faced with patients presenting

27

with a multitude of non-specific symptoms that could be cancer. Safety netting can be used to manage

28

diagnostic uncertainty by ensuring patients with vague symptoms are appropriately monitored, which is now

29

even more crucial due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its major impact on cancer referrals. The

30

ThinkCancer! Workshop is an educational behaviour change intervention aimed at the whole general practice

31

team, designed to improve primary care approaches to ensure timely diagnosis of cancer. The workshop will

32

consist of teaching and awareness sessions, the appointment of a Safety Netting Champion and the

33

development of a bespoke Safety Netting Plan, and has been adapted so it can be delivered remotely. This

34

study aims to assess the feasibility of the ThinkCancer! Intervention for a future definitive randomised

35

controlled trial.

36

Methods

37

The ThinkCancer! study is a randomised, multisite feasibility trial, with an embedded process evaluation and

38

feasibility economic analysis. Twenty-three to 30 general practices will be recruited across Wales, randomised

39

in a ratio of 2:1 of intervention versus control who will follow usual care. The workshop will be delivered by a

40

GP educator and will be adapted iteratively throughout the trial period. Baseline practice characteristics will be

41

collected via questionnaire. We will also collect Primary Care Intervals (PCI), Two Week Wait (2WW) referral

42

rates, conversion rates and detection rates at baseline and six months post-randomisation. Participant

43

feedback, researcher reflections and economic costings will be collected following each workshop. A process

44

evaluation will assess implementation using an adapted Normalisation Measure Development (NoMAD)

This study will allow us to test and further develop a novel evidenced-based complex intervention aimed at

INTRODUCTION

57

Background

58

Cancer survival in the UK lags behind other western countries.1 Referral rates and adherence to guidelines are

59

lower,2,3 primary care providers (PCPs) are less likely to take action on potential cancer symptoms4 and cancer

60

tends to be diagnosed at a later stage, often only after patients have presented to acute or emergency secondary

61

care services.3 Compared with the rest of Europe, the UK has relatively low one-year survival, which could be due

62

to later diagnosis.5

63

Timely diagnosis is key to improving cancer outcomes6 and cancer survival.7 Earlier diagnosis could also reduce

64

the proportion of cancer patients diagnosed through emergency care.7 Early diagnosis is a rising priority in cancer

65

policy,6,8 because it is cost-effective1 and the incidence of cancer is increasing.9 Policies in Wales emphasise the

66

importance of early diagnosis, and recognise that increasing demand and a slow referral process are significant

67

barriers to a quick cancer diagnosis.3 Following the implementation of these policies, progress has been slow,

68

with late stage diagnosis continuing to be an issue.10

69

The timely diagnosis of cancer has become even more crucial as we enter a period in which primary care and

70

cancer management has changed dramatically due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.11-13 Early figures have

71

shown a 76% decrease in urgent cancer referrals across the UK and predict a 20% increase in excess deaths for

72

patients with newly diagnosed cancers.14 There has also been a drop in the number of patients presenting to

73

primary care15; patients and clinicians may have concerns due to a perceived risk of contracting Covid-19 in a

74

healthcare setting.14 Some patients may also attribute symptoms that could be cancer to Covid-19 and therefore,

75

may avoid health services altogether.11,13,16 General practitioners (GPs) may also be reluctant to refer patients on

76

to secondary care in order to minimise infection risk.15 The increased use of remote consultation as a result of

77

the pandemic will also have implications for the early diagnosis of cancer, as important consultation techniques

78

such as the use of visual cues and physical examination may be impacted. These issues highlight the ever-

79

important need of safety netting, and Covid-related considerations will need to be made by GPs in their safety

80

netting approaches.11

81

Primary care providers (PCPs) play a vital role in the early diagnosis of cancer.17 A key diagnostic stage is the

82

Primary Care Interval (PCI), which is the time from first presentation to a GP with a symptom that could be cancer,

83

to the subsequent referral to a specialist in secondary care.18 However, with an ever expanding role, PCPs are

84

presented with a plethora of non-specific symptoms, of which only a small proportion are caused by cancer, and

85

many overlap with other diseases.6 Furthermore, with certain cancers, patients may not present with any alarm

86

symptoms6,17 which often results in a delayed cancer diagnosis.2 In addition, guidelines to expedite early cancer

87

diagnosis are often unclear, with great variation in strategies between different GPs.19

88

Rationale and previous work

89

Clinical behaviour change interventions targeting PCPs have the potential to address barriers to suspected cancer

90

identification and referral, and could expedite the diagnosis of cancer and improve cancer outcomes overall.20

91

There is some evidence that educational interventions targeted at PCPs could reduce the PCI, providing they

92

encompass a multidimensional, interactive and tailored approach.20-22 A recent systematic review of primary care

93

interventions suggested that a whole-practice approach providing opportunities for peer review and feedback

94

could have a positive effect on referral practices, in addition to existing guidelines being revisited through training

95

and reinforcement.23

96

While the timely diagnosis of cancer is crucial, urgent referral can lead to over-diagnosis and over-investigation

97

which can be harmful to the patient.7,24 This risk is especially high if the patient presents with vague symptoms.25

98

Safety netting, a tool used to manage diagnostic uncertainty,26 can address these issues by ensuring that patients

99

with non-specific symptoms are not ignored.24 Instead of immediate referral, patients are monitored according

100

to a set step-wise investigational plan, while ensuring they are referred in a timely manner as and when

101

required.24 Although safety netting is currently recommended by national guidelines,27 there are no clear

102

recommendations on how to do it.19,24,26

103

In summary, it is relevant and befitting to develop and test interventions aimed at improving the quality and

104

consistency of primary care approaches to ensure timely diagnosis of cancer in the UK. This will require

105

multicomponent and complex behavioural change interventions, which utilise a multidimensional, interactive,

106

tailored, whole-practice approach.

107

The ThinkCancer! intervention is a complex behaviour change intervention aimed at general medical practice

108

teams, developed as part of the Wales Interventions for Cancer Knowledge and Early Diagnosis (WICKED)

109

research programme, described in more detail elsewhere.28 It consists of an educational workshop that includes

110

early diagnosis and awareness sessions, evaluation of current practice-based safety netting systems and the

111

appointment of a safety netting champion. The workshop will be led by an educational facilitator who will guide

112

the development of a bespoke safety netting plan for each practice.

113

The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering the ThinkCancer! intervention and conducting a

114

future, definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, in order to

115

establish whether the intervention can be rolled out in practice.

131

Study design

132

The feasibility study incorporates a pragmatic, multisite, two-armed, superiority, pilot RCT. There is an embedded

133

process evaluation and feasibility economic analysis. The unit of randomisation is the general medical practice,

134

and the primary clinical outcome is collected at the practice level.

135

The term ‘feasibility’ is used in accordance with the conceptual framework developed by Eldridge and

136

colleagues,29 where it is described as an umbrella term within which pilot trials are a component. Furthermore,

137

the study has been designed in accordance with the MRC Framework for evaluating complex interventions.30 The

138

trial will be conducted according to NIHR guidance,31 and recommendations for good practice in pilot studies.32

139

The process evaluation, which will be based on a mixed-methods approach, will follow the MRC guidance for

140

process evaluations of complex interventions.33 During the initial piloting or feasibility testing stage of an

141

intervention, process evaluation has a vital role in understanding and planning the future potential

142

implementation of the intervention and optimising its design and evaluation.33

143

The feasibility economic analysis will explore the appropriate future perspective of analysis; most appropriate

144

methods of gathering costs; range and value of outcome measures, and undertake a feasibility budget impact

145

analysis of the ThinkCancer! intervention developed through a range of blended methods that it is delivered

146

online (either in a live format or pre-recorded) or face-to-face in general practices across north Wales.

147

This study protocol was developed in line with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional

148

Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines34; the SPIRIT checklist (appendix 1) and the schedule of procedures can be seen in Table

149

1. The SPIRIT checklist has been adapted in accordance with the CONSORT extension to pilot and feasibility

150

trials.35

156

Study setting

157

The setting for this study is primary care. The intervention will be delivered in-practice or online to individual

158

general medical practices and incorporates a whole-practice approach. The trial will be conducted across Wales

159

and practices will be recruited from all seven Welsh health boards.

160

Intervention

161

The proposed intervention, the ThinkCancer! Workshop, has four chief components. The first are two

162

educational sessions, one for all clinical staff (the ‘early diagnosis’ session) and one for non-clinical but patient-

163

facing staff (the ‘cancer aware’ session). The early diagnosis session is delivered as a teaching seminar with

164

learning outcomes focussed on NICE NG12 Suspected Cancer: recognition and referral guidelines27, hot topics

165

exploring the harder to recognise cancer presentations and consultation-level safety netting. As a proposed aid

166

to support and formalise safety netting, a new tool – the Symptom Safety Netting Action Plan (SSNAP) will be

167

introduced. This session will also see the introduction of the ThinkCancer! Handbook, which will contain all the

168

resources used in the workshop as well as external resources regarding early diagnosis and safety netting, such

169

as NICE guidance and online learning resources. The cancer aware session is less formal with more convenor-led

170

discussion around cancer red flag symptoms that non-clinical staff may encounter. The secondary aim of this

171

session is to gauge and explore issues and norms around raising concerns within the practice team. The third

172

session (the ‘safety netting session’) involves the two final components of the intervention, the co-production of

173

a bespoke Cancer Safety Netting Plan (CSNP) and appointment of a Cancer Safety Netting Champion (CSNC). This

174

session is attended by a combination of clinical and administrative staff who will be involved in the design and

175

implementation of a new plan.

176

Members of the research team will deliver the intervention; the GP Educator (AS) will oversee the workshop,

177

supported by up to two researchers. The workshop was originally designed to be delivered face-to-face in

178

participating practices during practices’ allocated protected time for educational and professional development.

179

However, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the workshop has been adapted into a digital format and can

9

180

be delivered in one of three ways: (i) fully remote and live via online conferencing platforms; (ii) blended delivery,

181

where practices are offered a combination of pre-recorded versions and live remote delivery of the different

182

sessions; and (iii) face-to-face in the practice, as originally intended, if the situation allows. Practices that opt for

183

the blended delivery of the workshop can choose to receive pre-recorded videos of sessions 1 and 2, presented

184

by the GP Educator, allowing participants to engage with the materials in their own time. The final session, which

185

focuses on the Cancer Safety Netting Plan, will still need to be delivered as a live session due to its interactive

186

components. There will be flexibility to work with the practice to allow the bespoke design of the workshop

187

format to improve the reach of the intervention. Practices receiving the intervention in any of the remote forms

188

will be sent all of the workshop materials, including the handbook and SSNAP tool, via post. If there is the

189

possibility to deliver the workshop face-to-face, materials will be distributed in the practice at the beginning of

190

the workshop. Practices randomised to the control group may also receive the pre-recorded videos at the end

191

of the study period, along with the intervention materials.

192

A logic model (figure 1) has been developed to describe the intervention components and how they link to the

193

intended outcomes and will be adapted throughout the study period.

202

A description of the excluded practices will be included to help identify potential future eligibility criteria and

203

reasons for non-participation will be sought.

204

Retention will be assessed quantitatively by the numbers of practices providing both baseline and follow up data.

205

Data on individual practice characteristics will be collected to:

206



describe the studied sample,

207



identify potential effect modifiers,

208



allow identification of ‘usual practice’

209

The overarching goal of the ThinkCancer! Intervention is to change GPs’ and primary care practices' behaviours

210

and systems, encouraging them to be more cancer-aware and act sooner on clinical presentations that could be

211

cancer, or more effectively safety net cases where concern exists but criteria for immediate referral are not met.

212

The proposed primary clinical outcomes for the definitive RCT relate to the early referral of suspected cancer.

213

They include the two-week wait (2WW) referral rate and the PCI. The 2WW referral rate is defined as the crude

214

rate of 2WW referrals multiplied by 100,000 and divided by practice list size.36 The PCI is defined as the time

215

between the date of first presentation and the date of referral.18

216

Secondary clinical outcome measures include the conversion rate and the detection rate. The conversion rate is

217

defined as the “proportion of 2WW referrals that are subsequently diagnosed with cancer”36 and the detection

218

rate consists of the “proportion of new cancer cases treated who were referred through the Two Week Wait

219

route”,36 also known as the sensitivity.37 These measures will allow us to further explore potential clinical

220

outcomes.

221

Although it is unlikely that we will detect a difference in the clinical measures in the feasibility study due to the

222

small sample and short duration of follow-up, we do expect these outcome measures to be affected by the

223

ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, the feasibility of using these outcomes will be assessed.

11

224

Feasibility of using potential clinical primary outcomes, 2WW referral rate, PCI, conversion rates and detection

225

rates, will be assessed quantitatively by determining:

226



ability to collect/capture data from the practices, based on completion rates of data collection forms

227



ability to extract relevant data from routinely collected data at Health Board level and from individual

228

practices, based on whether we are able to obtain the data via Health Board contacts and whether these

229

data are comparable with those collected by individual practices

230
231
232



suitability and variability of the data to perform as primary outcome measures for clinical effectiveness

Acceptance, adherence to and fidelity of the intervention will be assessed by:


233

reviewing participant views, reflections and perceptions expressed via post-workshop feedback forms
and interviews

234



post-workshop reflections from the intervention delivery staff

235



the ability to organise/schedule and deliver workshops

236



the number of practices that actively nominate a safety netting champion

237



the number of practices that demonstrate the use of the safety netting plan

238

To inform the process evaluation for the future definitive trial, we will:

239



evaluate how to scale up for any future process evaluation,

240



determine the acceptability and appropriateness of the interview process

241



identify barriers and facilitators to successful implementation,

242



test measures for assessing reach, dose and fidelity of the intervention

243

For the health economics component we will:

244



determine the feasibility of collecting data relating to the costing of the intervention via costings forms

245



identify variables necessary for the design of a future economic evaluation alongside a definitive trial

Adaptations to the intervention and logic model will also be recorded throughout the trial period.

251

Progression criteria

252

The outcome measures relating to recruitment, retention and adherence/fidelity will be assessed using RAG

253

criteria, as defined below:

254
255
256
257
258
259
260
261

1. Confirmation of adequate recruitment for a definitive trial at practice level. Go: 20 or more general
medical practices recruited; Review: 15-19 recruited; Stop: < 15 practices recruited.
2. Confirmation of adequate retention for the definitive trial at practice level. Go: 80% or more practices
retained; Review: 65-79% practices retained; Stop: < 65% practices retained
3. Confirmation of adequate fidelity of the intervention. Go: 80% or more of all intervention sessions
delivered, Review: 50-79% of all interventions delivered; Stop: < 50% of interventions delivered.
4. Confirmation of adequate fidelity at individual practice staff level:
From each general practice:

262

a. at least 50% of the clinical staff should attend the workshops;

263

b. at least 50% of the administrative staff should attend the workshops, comprising at least 50%

264
265

of the reception and secretarial staff as well as the practice manager.
c. Staff who do not attend the training should have the information cascaded to them by a

266

member of the team who did attend the training. At least 75% of the staff should receive the

267

training either directly or indirectly.

268

Progression criteria relating to obtaining data regarding completion of outcome measures will be assessed

269

using the following progression criteria:

1. Routine data. Go: data from 70% or more practices obtained; Review: data from < 70% of practices
obtained
2. Individual data. Go: data from 70% or more of individuals of each practice obtained; Review: data from
< 70% of individuals from each practice obtained

274

These criteria would reflect the potential outcomes for exclusion/inclusion at a full definitive trial stage rather

275

than prevention of the study progressing.

276

Sample size

277

We aim to recruit 23-30 general medical practices, depending on the ease of recruitment, using a randomisation

278

allocation ratio of 2:1 of intervention versus control. Randomising in preference to the intervention will allow us

279

to iteratively develop the intervention more effectively.

280

As this is a feasibility study, there is no requirement for a formal power calculation. This study is not intended to

281

be powered to identify a clinically meaningful difference between the intervention groups for the primary

282

outcome measures. Rather this study aims to provide robust estimates for the likely recruitment and retention

283

rates, and give an indication of the potential variability in the proposed outcome measures, which will in turn be

284

used to inform the power calculation for a future definitive RCT. This is discussed further under statistical

285

analyses.

286

Recruitment and consent

287

Recruitment

288

General practices will be identified through contact details publicly available via practice websites and through

289

contact lists provided by the health boards across Wales. Practices will be invited to participate using a

290

standardised invitation via email addressed to the practice manager, along with information about the study.

291

Practice managers will be asked to consult with their team and indicate their interest in participating in the study

14

292

by responding to the email. They will also need to advise of their practice’s availability for potential workshop

293

dates.

294

If no response to the initial email is received, a reminder email will be sent followed by a telephone call. A

295

participant flow diagram can be seen in figure 2.

296

Figure 2: Participant flow diagram

297

Practices that take part in the study will be financially reimbursed for their time. We will establish contacts within

298

regional primary care clusters, with health board staff and with R&D departments in order to maximise potential

299

recruitment opportunities. The recruitment methods will be continually assessed and iteratively developed to

300

determine the most appropriate recruitment strategy for a future definitive RCT.

301

Eligibility to participate

302

As feasibility is the main objective of this study, all types of general medical practice will be eligible for inclusion.

303

This will aid intervention refinement and allow for a better understanding of what is feasible across a range of

304

practices, and also why some practices may not be able to take part.

305

Inclusion

306

Any general practice in Wales is eligible for inclusion. The target audience for the intervention, based on a ‘whole

307

team approach’, includes all practice staff members. These may include, for example, GPs, nurse practitioners,

308

nurses, health care support workers (HCSWs), practice managers, administrators, receptionists or any other

309

practice staff, clinical and non-clinical. We would aim to include any new forms of primary care organisations

310

such as managed GP practice networks, or other general medical practice amalgamations, as well as traditional

311

GP partnerships. However, some of these may be unstable practices with no regular GP staff, and as such, they

312

may be difficult to recruit or find it difficult to participate. Practices participating in other research are also eligible

313

for inclusion; they will be asked to notify us of any cancer-related studies they may be participating in via the

314

baseline questionnaire.

315

Exclusion

316

There are no exclusion criteria.

317

Consent

318

Practice managers will be sent more detailed study information in the form of a ‘Research Information Sheet for

319

Practices’ (RISP) and a link to an online baseline practice questionnaire after they have expressed an interest to

320

take part in the study. Participating practice managers will need to indicate that they have read the study

321

information and have agreed with consent statements on the first page of the electronic questionnaire before

322

they can proceed. Prior to the commencement of the ThinkCancer! workshop, Participant Information Sheets

323

(PIS) will be provided by members of the research team and written consent will be obtained from all

324

participating members of staff. This will include consent to use anonymised data recorded on paper or audio-file

325

during workshops and workshop feedback forms. At this time point, participants will also be given the option to

326

provide their contact details should they be happy to be contacted for a telephone interview. Those who indicate

327

that they would like to take part will be contacted at least two months after the intervention. Participants from

328

practices randomised to the control arm, who do not take part in a workshop, will also have the opportunity to

329

take part in a telephone interview and will be sent an invitation letter via their practice manager. Response to

330

interview invitations and supplying of contact details will be taken as consent to be contacted and informed

331

consent will be obtained verbally at the time of interview.

332

NB Although we will initially contact practice managers, and they will most likely be the person who completes

333

the questionnaire, this task may be delegated to another member of the practice team with a particular interest

334

in the study.

335

Pre-trial pilot

336

A local practice, known to the research team, has agreed to participate in a ThinkCancer! pilot workshop prior to

337

full rollout of the feasibility study. The practice is an urban, large 12,000 patient training practice in a moderately

16

338

deprived region of North East Wales. Data will not be collected or recorded for trial purposes and feedback from

339

those participating will only be used to refine the intervention prior to its delivery across recruited practices.

340

Randomisation and blinding

341

The general medical practice will be the unit of randomisation. Randomisation will be achieved online, through

342

the remote randomisation centre at the North Wales Organisation for Randomisation Trials in Health (NWORTH)

343

at Bangor University. The randomisation system will use a dynamic adaptive allocation algorithm 39 to achieve

344

randomisation. ThinkCancer! is an open trial where blinding of participants, researchers and the statistician is

345

not possible due to the nature of the intervention and 2:1 ratio for randomisation.

346

Withdrawal criteria

347

Practices (and individuals within a practice) will be free to withdraw from the trial at any time, and their right to

348

refuse participation will be respected throughout. We will seek to understand their reasons where possible. In

349

terms of the primary outcome measures, as long as it is possible to collect the data, intention-to-treat analysis

350

will be utilised, whether or not the intervention was received or adhered to.

351

Data collection

352

The feasibility study will be used to rehearse data collection approaches and assess their ease of use. Data will

353

be collected at time-points specific to each item and depending on the type of data. All data collected in this

354

study will be anonymised.

355

Proposed clinical effectiveness outcomes

356

Data relating to the proposed primary outcomes for the future definitive RCT will be collected at baseline and 6

357

months after randomisation. Two week wait referral data and PCI data will be collected directly from

358

participating practices via Case Report Forms containing full instructions on how to extract the data from practice

359

IT systems. We will work with the Practice Manager, CSNC or other delegated individuals to achieve this. It is

360

recognised that this is likely to be too short a follow-up period for meaningful differences to be observed, but

17

361

the main purpose in this case will be to test the feasibility of collecting the data in this way. Additionally, we will

362

explore the availability of 2WW data at health board level.

363

Practice Questionnaires

364

The baseline and endline practice questionnaires will be available online to both intervention and control

365

practices and are to be filled out by the practice manager or other designated person, ideally in collaboration

366

with the practice team; SurveyMonkey™ will be the most likely platform. The questionnaires will consist of closed

367

questions and some open, free-text questions, and will be used to collect data for each individual practice on the

368

practice characteristics and current systems, and existing practice systems relating to cancer diagnosis and safety

369

netting. The baseline data may be used to inform some workshop planning - i.e. workshop content and delivery

370

may be tailored to some extent to suit individual practice needs and circumstances. Further process evaluation

371

data will also be collected from the practice questionnaires as they will incorporate questions exploring

372

contextual factors known to influence the success of quality improvement approaches used to improve health

373

care.40 The baseline questionnaire will be completed by all practices prior to randomisation. The endline

374

questionnaire will assess any differences in practice, knowledge or systems in comparison with those measured

375

at baseline and will be completed at 6 months post-randomisation.

376

Baseline measures will include the following:

377



378

Demographic information and practice characteristics (practice size, research-accredited status, number
of clinical and non-clinical staff members, whether a teaching practice, etc.)

379



Practice culture (e.g. team structure, diversity of team member roles, team decision-making processes)

380



Practice knowledge with regards to safety netting and cancer awareness

381



Current safety netting systems in place, if any, including:

382

o

What systems are in place

383

o

How widely they are used within the practice

384

o

How safety netting issues are communicated:

389

Feasibility and piloting data

390

Recruitment, retention and questionnaire completion numbers will be recorded throughout the trial.

391

Spreadsheet systems will be put in place to record practice responses and to track their progress in the trial (e.g.

392

number of practices approached, whether they have responded to the initial invitation, whether they have

393

agreed to be randomised, etc.). Separate spreadsheets will also record feasibility data relating to the workshop

394

itself, such as participant numbers.

395

Post-workshop reflections and participant feedback

396

Data specific to the intervention will be collected via participant feedback and observation and reflections of the

397

research staff. Participant feedback forms will be distributed to practice staff; these can be completed in paper

398

format or online. Responses will be requested using a combination of Yes/No choices, Likert scales and free-text

399

comments. The questions will cover a number of areas including acceptability, usefulness, learning outcomes

400

and the potential to change practice.41

401

Relevant ad hoc communications with practices throughout the study will also be collected on a spreadsheet,

402

which may contribute to understanding the intervention in terms of what works, why and how.

403

The same research team members will deliver the intervention in all practices; their observations will be

404

collected and will inform any refinements of the intervention. Observations and reflections recorded by the

405

research team may provide valuable data on the potential effects of contextual factors, site-by-site and

406

component-by-component measures, and the appropriateness of individual questions included in the practice

407

questionnaires. They will also describe the cancer safety netting plan proposed by the practice and whether the

408

SSNAP tool is used.

409

The researchers will keep a diary, which will include a record of any modifications made to the intervention and

410

data collection methods.

411

Health economics

412

Health economics data collection sheets will be completed by the researchers following each workshop, and

413

costings specific to the practice will be recorded. We will also use the feedback forms to determine staff roles

414

within the practice for costing purposes.

415

NoMAD instrument

416

At least two months after the intervention, participants who consented to be contacted will be sent a link to

417

complete an adapted Normalisation Measure Development (NoMAD) instrument.42 This will assess the

418

implementation of the cancer safety netting plan using Normalization Process Theory (NPT) principles, which

419

may or may not include the SSNAP tool depending on uptake.

420

Telephone interviews

421

We will conduct qualitative telephone interviews lasting up to 30 minutes with a purposive sample of up to 45

422

clinical and non-clinical practice staff. Practice staff in both arms of the trial will be eligible to participate in the

423

interviews as they will be invited to give feedback on all aspects of the trial process including the intervention

424

where appropriate. The qualitative interviews are designed to achieve an in-depth understanding of the views

425

and perceptions of practice staff involved in the trial. The interviews will allow participants to explain how they

426

were able to utilise aspects of the trial and how they worked in practice. Informed consent will be obtained and

427

interviews recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interviews will be semi-structured and will follow a pre-

428

defined topic guide, although not every participant will be engaged with every section of the topic guide (i.e.

429

only the specific areas of the topic guide that are relevant to an individual’s role and experience will be explored).

430

Topics may include acceptability, safety netting, data collection, uptake of the intervention and SSNAP tool and

431

implications. These interviews will occur at least two months after the intervention has taken place; control

432

practices will be invited two months post-randomisation.

433

Adverse events

434

A risk assessment has found this trial to be low risk. Non-serious adverse events will not be collected. However,

435

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported that could be related to the intervention, as decided by the Chief

436

Investigator (CI), and in line with current ICH-GCP Standard Operating Procedures.43 SAEs are defined as follows:

437

“…an untoward occurrence that (a) results in death; (b) is life-threatening; (c) requires hospitalisation;

438

(d) results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; (e) consists of a congenital anomaly or birth

439

defect; or (f) is otherwise considered medically significant by the investigator”43

440

We do not expect any related SAEs for this study.

441

Data analysis

442

Quantitative analysis

443

A fully documented statistical analysis plan will be prepared by a registered trials unit and agreed by the co-

444

investigators and approved by the trial governance structure, which will be known as the Trial Steering

445

Committee (TSC).

446

Baseline characteristics will be summarised for all practices, the intervention group and control groups

447

separately. Feasibility and process evaluation data such as practice recruitment rate, implementation and uptake

448

of and adherence to the intervention, and follow-up rates will be summarised and presented as percentages.

449

Determining differences in clinical outcomes between the control and intervention is not the primary purpose

450

of this study, therefore the focus of the results will be on the estimates of the treatment effects rather than

451

statistical significance and as such, no hypothesis testing will be undertaken. As recommended in guidelines for

452

good practice for the analysis of pilot studies,32 summary estimates of effects will be developed along with their

453

95% confidence intervals. Differences between the two comparison groups will be presented in the form of an

454

unadjusted mean difference for continuous outcomes, and an odds ratio for binary outcomes. Exploratory

455

analysis using ANCOVA for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for binary outcomes will consider

456

adjustment for the stratification variables in assessment of the treatment effects.

457

Factors associated with the ability to implement the intervention will be tentatively explored using logistic

458

regression with the focus on identifying deterministic barriers to implementation rather than probabilistic

459

factors. The nature of the intervention may vary, directed by real-time feedback during the course of the trial

460

and this will need to be taken into consideration during analysis.

461

As this is a feasibility study, there will be no imputation of missing data over and above any scoring rules

462

established for the outcomes. This information will be used to feed into the suitability and applicability of the

463

chosen outcome measures.

464

Economic Analysis

465

Alongside the statistical analysis plan, a Health Economics Analysis Plan (HEAP) will be produced setting out the

466

objectives, methods and plans for dissemination of the health economics findings.44 The costing of the

467

development of the ThinkCancer! Intervention will include researcher time, piloting, materials development,

468

printing, publication, development of online materials, etc. Delivery costs of the ThinkCancer! Intervention will

469

be determined based on the following:

470



Online delivery format – live seminars/webinars, staff time and materials, exploration of whether

471

health professional time should be collected in a full trial to reflect the co-production nature of CPD in

472

own time or reflecting the opportunity cost of CPD in terms of time not spent on direct patient care

473

activities.

474
475



Mixed-format delivery – potential costs of a face-to-face/online delivery format across Wales in future
after COVID-19.

476

Qualitative analysis

477

The transcribed telephone interviews, the free text responses from the feedback forms and the observational

478

data, in text form, will be analysed for the process evaluation using Framework Analysis.45 Framework is a five-

479

stage matrix-based system for analysing qualitative data which is highly appropriate for a feasibility study which

480

is iterative in its development. Initially all transcripts and textual data will be read thoroughly by the same

481

researcher who conducted the interviews to achieve data familiarisation and immersion. An index of emergent

482

themes will then be created and data coded according to the index. Charts will be created according to the

483

themes and coded data will be synthesised into the appropriate thematic charts. The completed charts will then

484

be used for final stage which is in-depth interpretation.45

485
486

TRIAL MANAGEMENT

487

The Sponsor is Bangor University. The study will be supported by the North Wales Organisation for Randomised

488

Trials in Health (NWORTH), which is a fully registered Clinical Trials Unit.

489

There will be no on-site monitoring as there are no local research teams at sites. Therefore, the monitoring of

490

data will have a more internal focus in the form of self-audits to ensure compliance with regulations.

491

Trial governance

492

Operational group

493

The operational working group will be responsible for the overall conduct, supervision and progress of the study.

494

They consist of the immediate research team, supported by a wider group of experts.

495

Trial Management group

496

The Trial Management group (TMG) will meet once a month, consisting of the operational group and a wider

497

team of experts, including a PPI member. The group will be responsible for the overall management of the trial,

498

and ensuring the study adheres to the protocol.

499

Trial Governance Structure

500

A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) committee will provide independent oversight for the study, ensuring it is

501

conducted according to the standards set out by the HRA Research Governance Framework.46 As the study

502

includes an element of ongoing intervention refinement, and is deemed low risk with very minimal likelihood of

503

stopping early due to patient safety, a Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will not be required.47

504

Meetings are expected to be biannual and the Sponsor and Funder will be updated following each meeting. The

505

TSC will have an independent chairperson and at least three independent members including Patient and Public

506

Involvement (PPI) representation, trial co-applicants, statisticians, health economist(s) and GPs.

507

Data Management

508

A detailed data management plan will be written by NWORTH staff. This plan will include the definition of the

509

data quality checks that will be performed on the data throughout the life course of the trial. These will include

510

source data validation, random data checks and timelines for data entry.

511

Quality control

512

Quality control will be maintained through adherence to the study protocol, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health

513

Board/Bangor University Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), principles of Good Clinical Practice, research

514

governance and clinical trial regulations.

515

Data protection and participant confidentiality

516

All investigators, trial site and research staff will comply with the requirements and regulations of the EU General

517

Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR) regarding the collection, storage, processing and disclosure of personal

518

information and will uphold the Regulation’s core principles. All research staff involved will have up to date GCP

519

training. Research data will be retained as per the Sponsor’s research data management policy. Bangor University

520

is the data custodian.

521

Data archiving

522

As per the Sponsor’s research data management policy, research data and records will be archived along with

523

the data management policy of the Sponsor.

524

In line with legal requirements, trial documents will be archived centrally at a secure facility with appropriate

525

environmental controls and adequate protection from fire, flood and unauthorized access. Archived material will

526

be stored in tamper-proof archive boxes that are clearly labelled. Electronic archiving will be provided by the

527

Sponsor for post-project deposit and retention of data.

528

Destruction of essential documents will require authorisation from the Sponsor.

529

Dissemination policy

530

On completion of the study a final report will be prepared for Cancer Research Wales.

531

Findings will be disseminated through various media, including open-access peer-reviewed publications, national

532

and international conferences, the programme web pages, social media, and through an end-of-programme

533

symposium for key stakeholders. Findings will also be disseminated to participating practice teams.

534

Publications arising directly from the WICKED programme and authorship on the final trial report will adhere to

535

the BMJ guidelines on authorship and contribution, based on the International Committee of Medical Journal

536

Editors Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical

537

Journals (ICMJE) 2013.48

538

Patient and public involvement

539

The study team recognises that the involvement of those with lived experiences will be vital in this research.

540

Furthermore, a lay perspective is essential in the development and undertaking of research for the promotion of

541

equality, diversity and transparency. Two patient representatives were initially recruited to the WICKED

542

programme, one of whom has maintained active involvement in the study design, the development of the

543

protocol and conduct throughout. Additionally, the trial PPI has been active in providing feedback on participant-

544

facing documents. Two more PPI representatives have been recruited to the TSC through the North Wales Cancer

545

Forum and have directly relevant experience. Their perspective as both a patient and a member of the public will

546

inform the overall supervision of the trial.

DISCUSSION

This study aims to test the feasibility of the ThinkCancer! intervention. The ThinkCancer! Study comprises Work

550

Package 4 (WP4) of a programme of research called the Wales Interventions and Cancer Knowledge about Early

551

Diagnosis (WICKED). The intervention will consist of a workshop aimed at the entire general practice team, as

552

previous work packages have demonstrated the value of a whole-practice approach. If the intervention is shown

553

to be feasible, we will proceed with designing a full-scale definitive trial.

554

This trial is especially relevant due to the current ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which has had a major negative

555

impact on suspected cancer referrals to secondary care, and will likely delay many cancer diagnoses and

556

treatments, leading to poorer patient outcomes. One of the key strengths of this intervention is that it can be

557

iteratively developed throughout the study period, which will ensure the future definitive trial will adopt an

558

optimal approach. The design process of the study is also a strength in that a strong multidisciplinary team and

559

advisory groups have been involved throughout. Furthermore, the mixed methods approach will allow us to

560

capture a variety of data from this complex intervention. Furthermore, the planned rigour with which the study

561

will be conducted is also a strength.

562

We are aware that some challenges in the recruitment lay ahead, but we plan to work with the various

563

research infrastructures in Wales to overcome this. We plan to work closely with the Primary Care Specialty

564

Lead and Primary Care Research Managers within Health and Care Research Wales, as well as with the

565

individual health board R&D departments in order to maximise recruitment. We will also work closely with the

566

practices that agree to take part in order to support their participation in the study.

567

Although safety-netting has garnered more attention in recent years, there currently are no recommendations

568

on how best to do it.26 To our knowledge, there are no interventions targeting primary care with a focus on

569

safety netting. In addition, involving the entire practice is a relatively novel approach, with great potential

570

benefit. This study encompasses a multicomponent and complex behavioural change intervention comprising a

571

multidimensional, interactive, tailored and whole-practice approach, which is timely and needed to optimise

572

primary care approaches to the timely diagnosis of cancer.
