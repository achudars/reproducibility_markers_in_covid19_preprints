Abstract.
Background. Populations heavily exposed to the novel coronavirus provide an
opportunity to estimate the mortality from COVID-19 in different age groups.
Methods. The mortality reported by May 13 from COVID-19 among Diamond Princess
cruise ship passengers, and New York residents and Metropolitan Transit Authority
(MTA) workers was estimated based on publicly available information.
Results. The mortality among children (age 0 to 17 yrs) in New York City was 1 in
172,692. The mortality in New York state was 1 in 322,217 for ages 10-19 yrs., and 1 in
36,725 for ages 20-29 yrs. The mortality among New York transit workers was
estimated to be 1 in 7,329 for ages 30-39 years; 1 in 1,075 for ages 40-49 yrs.; 1 in 343
for ages 50-59 yrs.; and 1 in 178 for ages 60-69 yrs. Among Diamond Princess
passengers, the mortality was estimated to be 1 in 145 for ages 70-79, and 1 in 54 for
ages 80-89.
Conclusions: Mortality among populations exposed to the novel coronavirus increases
with age, ranging from about 1 in 170,000 below the age of 18 years, to 1 in 54 above
the age of 80 years.

Introduction.
Certain confined, occupational and regional populations have had substantial
exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19). Such populations provide an opportunity to estimate the mortality which
might occur after many members of a population have been exposed.
The COVID-19 outbreak occurring on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in
February 2020 has resulted in the deaths of 14 passengers, and has provided a window
into the effect of the virus in the elderly.1 In the United States, the large populations of
New York state and city, the epicenter of the national outbreak, provide an opportunity
to estimate mortality in children and young adults. Finally, as of May 6, 2020, 109 New
York Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) workers have died from coronavirus.2-4 This
population provides an opportunity to estimate the mortality in older working adults, and
has not been previously studied, to our knowledge.

Methods.
We estimated from publicly available sources the coronavirus-related mortality
for each age group on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, in the United States
(nationally), in New York City and state, and among New York Metropolitan Transit
Authority workers.2-4
The age breakdown of New York City’s population was determined by dividing
the COVID-19 deaths by the mortality rates reported by the New York City Department
of Health.5
The New York State population age breakdown was obtained from the census.6
The United States population, total and by decade, were tabulated.7,8
Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for proportions were determined, unless
the denominator was over 10,000, in which case Poisson confidence intervals were
determined. Only data available to the public were used. The study was approved by
the VCU Office of Research Subjects Protection.

Results.
Mortality Among Younger New Yorkers.
Among children in New York City (ages 0 to 17 years), the coronavirus mortality
was estimated to be 1 in 173,000, with a 95% CI of 1 in 360,000 to 1 in 94,000 (Tables
1-2).5 Nationally, infants under age 1 tended to have a higher mortality (1 in 947,500),
compared with children age 1 to 14 (1 in 9,517,000) (Table 3).9

Adult Mortality and New York City Transit.
The New York MTA has 74,000 employees, most of whom are represented by
the Transport Workers Union.11 In total, 106 of the 109 MTA workers who had died of
coronavirus as of May 6, 2020 were in the subways and buses division, which has
55,000 employees.12
Of the 68 New York City MTA workers who died of coronavirus, and whose ages
could be determined from public sources, one was in his 30s (1.5%, 95% CI 0.04-7.9%),
9 were in their 40s (13.2%, 95% CI 6.2-23.6%), 29 were in their 50s (42.7%, 95% CI
30.7-55.2%), 25 were in their 60s (36.8%, 95% CI 25.4-49.3%), and 4 were in their 70s
(5.9%, 95% CI 1.6-14.4%). None was younger than 39 or older than 73. The agedistribution of known deaths was applied to the 106 total deaths in the bus and subways
division to estimate the numbers of deaths in each decade (Table 5).2-4,13
The age distribution of MTA employees is: 18-25 years (1.7%), 26-35 years
(16.0%), 36-54 years (53.1%), 55-62 years (22.8%), and over 63 years (6.4%).13 From
this distribution, the number of the 55,000 bus and subway workers was calculated for
each age decade (Table 5).
Among New York MTA workers during the pandemic, the mortality was estimated
to be 1 in 7,329 for ages 30-39; 1 in 1,075 for ages 40-49; 1 in 343 for ages 50-59; 1 in
178 for ages 60-69 (Tables 2, 5).

The Diamond Princess and Elderly Mortality.
The age ranges of the passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the
time of the coronavirus outbreak have been published (Table 6).1 A total of 14 of the
3711 passengers have died from coronavirus, as of May 13, 2020, including one
woman in her 60s (Table 6).14
Seven Diamond Princess passengers in their 70s died of COVID-19.15-20 For
ages 70 to 79 years, the mortality was 1 in 145, with 95% confidence limits from 1 in
357, to 1 in 70 (Tables 2, 6). A lower bound for mortality in exposed populations from
70 to 79 years of age comes from the data of New York State, where the mortality was
1 in 184, with 95% confidence limits of 1 in 189 to 1 in 179 (Tables 2, 4).
Four Diamond Princess passengers in their 80s died of COVID-19.21-22 The
mortality was for this age group was 1 in 54, (95% CI 1 in 196, to 1 in 21, Tables 2, 6).
A lower bound for mortality in the exposed elderly is obtained from the data of New York
City, where the observed mortality for ages 75 and over was 1 in 74, with 95%
confidence limits of 1 in 76, to 1 in 72 (Tables 1-2).
The mortality for these age decades on the Diamond Princess might actually be
higher, but the ages of 2 of the 14 passengers who died was not disclosed (Table
6).23,24

Discussion.
This study found that the mortality from coronavirus among highly exposed
populations is heavily dependent on age, ranging from about 1 in 170,000 under age
18, to 1 in 54 for those in their 80s. It will be important for all people, especially older
adults, to take precautions to avoid infection. The strength of this study is that our
method did not require estimation of the prevalence of infection or case fatality ratios
(since there is no consensus about these values yet). It should be emphasized that the
tabulated mortality rates are not infection fatality rates (fractions of infected people who
die). Rather, the listed mortality rates are the fraction of the entire population who died.
Children seem to be at a low risk of mortality from coronavirus, around 1 in
170,000 in New York City to date. However, the national data do suggest that infants
may be at a higher risk of coronavirus-related mortality than other children. As schools
have been closed during the pandemic, the exposure of children to the virus, even in
New York, was in all likelihood less than that of the other groups studied (MTA workers,
Diamond Princess passengers). Presumably, if schools reopen, the mortality among
children will increase. Still, it is likely that the mortality among children will remain
several orders of magnitude below that of older adults.
The mortality among young adults age 20-39 is fairly low, but still an important
consideration for both individual and institutional decision-making. One New York MTA
worker in his late 30s died of coronavirus. A second New York transit worker in his mid30s died of coronavirus, though technically he was not an MTA employee, and
therefore, did not factor in our analysis.2 The New York state data confirms that these
deaths of workers in their 30s were not unprecedented. It would be useful if localities
(and national authorities) could release coronavirus demographic data broken down
with more granularity. For instance, colleges would be most interested in the data from
age 18-22 years.
This was the first study of the mortality among New York transit workers, to our
knowledge. Analysis of this group helps to characterize the mortality among older
working age adults. The first confirmed case of coronavirus infection in New York City
was reported on March 1, 2020.25 The MTA workers were forbidden to wear masks
and gloves until March 8.26,27 On March 26, two MTA workers died from coronavirus—
the first MTA workers to suffer this fate.28 An announcement that the MTA would
provide the workers with masks on came on March 27.29 On April 4, 2020, the MTA
was able to obtain 250,000 N95 masks for the workers.30 On April 15, the governor of
New York announced an order to require that after a 3-day notification period, the public
would be required to wear masks when unable to socially distance, such as on public
transit.31 Therefore, there was a delay of 5 weeks between presence of the infection in
the city and the MTA obtaining masks, and of 7 weeks until the public was required to
wear masks when in transit.

Based on the New York transit worker data, the mortality risk among exposed
populations continues to increase progressively in the 40s and 50s. The sole fatality on
the USS Theodore Roosevelt, on which a coronavirus outbreak occurred, was a 41year-old sailor.32
In highly-exposed populations, the fraction of the population infected has been
less than 100%. On some ships with outbreaks, all on board were tested. On the USS
Theodore Roosevelt, 856 of 4845 sailors (17.7%) tested positive for the virus.32 On the
Diamond Princess, 619 of 3,711 passengers (16.7%) tested positive for coronavirus,
only half of whom were symptomatic.1 Among New York MTA workers, a group which
was not universally tested, over 6000 workers (8%) have either tested positive (over
2000), or entered quarantine (4000 workers).33 In these populations, it is not known if
those who tested negative were false negatives, were tested at the wrong time, had less
exposure than their fellow passengers or workers, or were less susceptible to infection.
This study has a number of limitations. If the Diamond Princess passengers or
MTA workers had not all been exposed to the virus, then the observed mortality
underestimates the potential mortality. Also, there might be differences between the
Diamond Princess population or the MTA workers and the population at large. The
MTA workers were mostly minorities, and one could argue that they suffered excess
mortality because of preexisting medical conditions. On the other hand, many of the
most disabled are excluded from working or travelling at sea. Our study did not
estimate the mortality among nursing home patients, which has been substantially
higher than that of the general population.
