ABSTRACT

Background: While the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is
becoming increasingly clear, there is little data on IgA response, the first line of
bronchial immune defense.

Objective: To determine, whether COVID-19 is associated with a vigorous total IgA
response and whether IgA autoantibodies are associated with complications of
severe illness. Since thrombotic events are frequent in severe COVID-19 and
resemble hypercoagulation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), our approach
focused on antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).

Materials and methods: In this retrospective cohort study we compared clinical
data and aPL from 64 patients with COVID-19 from three independent centers (two
in Switzerland, one in Liechtenstein). Samples were collected from April 9, 2020 to
May 1, 2020. Total IgA and aPL were measured with FDA-approved commercially
available clinical diagnostic kits.

Results: Clinical records of the 64 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed and
divided into a cohort with mild illness (mCOVID, n=26 [41%]), a discovery cohort with
severe illness (sdCOVD, n=14 [22%]) and a confirmation cohort with severe illness
(scCOVID, n=24 [38%]). Severe illness was significantly associated with increased
total IgA (sdCOVID, P=0.01; scCOVID, P<0.001). Total IgG levels were similar in
both cohorts. Among aPL, both cohorts with severe illness significantly correlated
with elevated anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001), anti-

Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID, P=0.003; scCOVID, P<0.001), and anti-Beta2
Glycoprotein-1 IgA (sdCOVID and scCOVID, P<0.001). Systemic lupus
erythematosus was excluded from all patients as a potential confounder of APS.

Conclusions: Higher total IgA and IgA-aPL were consistently associated with
severe illness. These novel data strongly suggest that a vigorous antiviral IgAresponse triggered in the bronchial mucosa induces systemic autoimmunity.

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic with wideranging health and socio-economic implications. After SARS and the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome, it represents the third known spillover of a severe
coronavirus-associated disease from animals to humans in the last twenty years (13). SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by attachment to and subsequent internalization
of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors that are highly expressed by type-II
pneumocytes in the deep bronchial system (4), where IgA immunoglobulins
produced in the bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) are the main line of
humoral defense (5). Indeed, specific IgA against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
have been shown to appear early in infected patients (6). However, despite the
important role of IgA in mucosal immunity, the rate of total IgA generated by that
response and its role in COVID-19 severity remains unexplored.
Autopsies have shown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis to be
the most common complications in critically-ill COVID-19 patients (7). A large case
series from Northern Italy that assessed lung histologies of deceased COVID-19
patients presents consistent diffuse alveolar damage and necrosis of pneumocytes
(8). A distinctive factor for COVID-19 was a marked presence of diffuse thrombosis
of the peripheral small vessels. This is in line with reports of frequent
thromboembolisms of patients with severe COVID-19 that occur despite the
prophylactic in-hospital use of low weight molecular heparins (9, 10). While the
reasons remain unclear, a recent report describes a case series of severe COVID-19
patients with stroke and elevated levels of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies
compatible with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (11). APS is an acquired

autoimmune disease that is mediated by autoantibodies directed against
phospholipid-binding proteins that leads to hypercoagulability. The most common
trigger factor of APS is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), followed by lung
infections with mycobacteria or viruses (12). These cases suggest that COVID-19
leads to virally triggered APS in severe COVID-19 patients. To our knowledge,
complete aPL profiling in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 has never been
undertaken. The aim of this study was to explore, whether patients with severe
COVID-19 have elevated total IgA as an immediate immune response and aPL
compatible with APS.

METHODS
This multicenter cohort study was conducted at the three following tertiary care
hospitals: the Landesspital Liechtenstein (LLS) in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, the
Kantonsspital St. Gallen (KSSG) in St. Gallen, Switzerland, and the University
Hospital Zurich (USZ) in Zurich, Switzerland. The collection of patient data and blood
samples were approved by the respective local ethics committees of the participating
study centers (Project-IDs 2020-00676, 2020-00821, and 2020-00646). All
participants agreed to the hospitals’ general consent policies allowing further use of
clinical data and biologic material (LLS and KSSG) or signed an informed consent
(USZ). Where signing of informed consent was not possible due to severe illness
and to prevent surface contamination, consent was sought verbally or from the next
of kin, which had been approved by the local ethics committee.

Collection of data: Samples of serum or plasma anticoagulated with lithium
heparinate (LHP) were collected from April 9, 2020, to May 1, 2020. We included

patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was confirmed either by real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology. RT-PCR was
performed and interpreted in strict adherence to World Health Organization
guidelines (13). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed by two different antibody
tests: a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA, gold nanoparticle-based,
SGIT flex Covid 19, Sugentech, South Korea) and an electro-chemiluminescence
immunoassay (ECLIA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche Diagnostics International
Ltd, Switzerland). Seropositivity was defined as a positive IgG result in the LFIA that
was confirmed in the ECLIA.
Patients were categorized into the following cohorts: 1. mild illness without
requirement of hospitalization (mCOVID), 2. a discovery cohort of patients with
severe illness (sdCOVID), and 3. an independent confirmation cohort of patients with
severe illness (scCOVID). Mild illness was defined as uncomplicated upper
respiratory tract infection with unspecific symptoms or uncomplicated pneumonia,
while severe illness for the sdCOVID and scCOVID cohorts required hospitalization
and included severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock (13).

Immunoglobulins and aPL testing: aPL antibodies were determined by
fluorescence enzyme immunoassay on a Phadia 250 analyzer (Thermo Fisher
Diagnostics AG, Steinhausen, Switzerland) using EliATM Cardiolipin as well as
EliATM Beta 2-Glycoprotein 1 assays for IgG, IgA, and IgM isotoypes (all Thermo
Fisher Diagnostics AG, Steinhausen, Switzerland). Total IgA and IgG were
determined on a Cobas c501 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland)
with a nephelometric assay (IgA-2, Tina-quant IgA Gen.2, and IgGu2, Tina-quant
IgG Gen.2, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). IgG against SS-A/Ro, SS-

B/La, dsDNA, Sm, chromatin and RNP were simultaneously determined by beadbased suspension array principle on a Bioplex 2200 System (Biorad Laboratories,
Cressier, Switzerland). Coefficients of variations, as determined by commercially
available control materials were 4.5% for total IgA, <2.0% for total IgG, 4.6% for aPL
antibodies, and 3.7% for lupus-antibodies. All measurements were performed in the
same laboratory (Labormedizinisches Zentrum Dr. Risch, Vaduz, Liechtenstein).

Statistical methods: Point estimates of autoantibody levels were described using
the mean and the standard error of the mean. Differences in autoantibody levels
between cohorts were assessed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. All Pvalues were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate
(FDR) method. Statistical significance was defined at the level of FDR <0.05. All
analyses were performed using R software, version 3.5.0 (R Project for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Furthermore, we generated hierarchical clustering
(spearman clustering distance and a complete clustering method) on the median
centered values of antibody levels. Missing values were replaced with the respective
mean value across the remaining patients.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics: We collected a total of 64 serum or LHP samples from
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (one sample per patient). The mean age of all
patients was 62 years (IQR, 46-74) and 32 (60%) were male. 26 (41%) only had mild
symptoms without the need for hospitalization and were allotted to the mCOVID
cohort. The average age among mildly symptomatic patients was 57 (IQR, 45-63)
years and 9 (35%) were male. 38 (59%) patients had severe COVID-19 and required

hospitalization: the sdCOVID cohort included 14 (22%) and the scCOVID 24 (38%)
patients. Their mean age was 70 (IQR, 58-76) years and they were predominantly
male (28 [74%]). 59 (92%) of 64 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive
via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which included all patients from
the sdCOVID and scCOVID cohorts, as well as 19 patients from the mCOVID cohort.
The remaining 7 (11%) patients from the mCOVID cohort were confirmed by
serology.
4/26 (15%) patients in the mCOVID cohort had co-morbidities predisposing to severe
COVID-19, of which the most frequent was hypertension (3/26 [12%]). In contrast,
26/28 (93%) severely ill patients had at least one co-morbidity, of which the most
common were hypertension (26/38 [68%]), cardiovascular disease (25/38 [66%]) and
diabetes mellitus (13/38 [34%]). Of note, 13/38 (34%) of patients with severe COVID19 developed thromboses during hospitalization, while none of the mCOVID patients
reported thronboses. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.

Antibody results: Severely ill COVID-19 patients had significantly higher total IgA
titers compared to mCOVID patients (sdCOVID, mean 2.94 g/l, SD ±0.46, P=0.01;
scCOVID mean 3.04 g/l, SD ±0.19, P<0.001), but not higher total IgG (sdCOVID
mean 7.69 g/l, SD ±0.55, P=0.09; scCOVID not measured). They also had
significantly higher anti-Cardiolipin IgA (sdCOVID mean 6.38 U/ml, SD ±0.96,
P<0.001; scCOVID mean 4.86 U/ml, SD ±0.84, P<0.001), anti-Beta2 Glycoprotein-1
IgA (sdCOVID mean 8.50 U/ml, SD ±3.86, P<0.001; scCOVID mean 4.71 U/ml, SD
±2.17, P<0.001), and Cardiolipin IgM (sdCOVID mean 4.01 U/ml, SD ±0.88,
P=0.003; scCOVID mean 10.35 U/ml, SD ±5.48, P<0.001), as shown in Figure 1.
With two other aPL antibodies we found a significant difference only in the sdCOVID

but not the scCOVID cohort: anti-Cardiolipin IgG (sdCOVID mean 8.23 U/ml, SD
±4.02, P=0.02; scCOVID mean 2.42, SD ±0.54, P=0.09) and anti-Beta2
Glycoprotein-1 IgG (sdCOVID mean 1.57 U/ml, SD ±0.23, P=0.002; scCOVID mean
1.58 U/ml, SD ±0.85, P=0.15). No significant difference was found among anti-Beta2
Glycoprotein-1 IgM among the cohorts (sdCOVID mean 1.07 U/ml, SD ±0.25,
P=0.16; scCOVID mean 2.00 U/ml, SD ±0.72, P=0.16), as shown in Figure 2.
Hierarchical clustering analysis further indicated common elevation of antibody titers
among patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (see Figure 3).
Since APS is commonly triggered by SLE serology screening was performed for all
patients, as described in the methods section. One patient from the scCOVID cohort
had elevated anti-La IgG (7.4 U/mL, normal < 1 U/mL) but no other lupus-specific
antibodies. None of the other patients were positive for any SLE-associated
antibodies.

DISCUSSION
In this study we measured total IgA and IgG, as well as aPL in COVID-19 patients of
similar age and compared the results of mildly ill with severely ill patients. For
severely ill patients we established a discovery and investigation cohort, allowing
eliminating potential center-specific confounders. Our novel finding shows a marked
elevation of total IgA that is significantly associated with severe COVID-19, which to
our knowledge has not been reported before. There is no significant association with
total IgG. These data are in line with our hypothesis, that a strong, IgA-driven
immune response emerges from the BALT when SARS-CoV-2 affects the deeper
respiratory system. In line with literature, about a third of severely ill patients
developed thromboses (14). To explain thromboembolisms, we found that total IgA

and aPL IgA antibodies were significantly associated with severe illness. This
correlation could neither be seen for total IgG, nor for aPL IgG antibodies. It is likely
that a deep bronchial viral infection leads to a stronger immune response in the
BALT than an upper respiratory infection, which may explain the high level of IgA in
severely ill patients compared to patients with mild disease. (15) While an
association of aPL and severe COVID-19 has been established, which strongly
supports our findings (16), the elevation of total IgA together with IgA-aPL draws the
missing link between immune response and hypercoagulation through induction of
IgA-dominated APS.
APS is most commonly triggered by SLE (12). To eliminate this potential confounder,
we conducted a lupus serology of all patients in our cohort that showed no
indications for SLE in our cohorts (17). Another potential trigger of APS is infection
including pneumonia, that may trigger a molecular mimicry mechanism (18-20). In
the case of COVID-19 such as mechanism is likely mediated by pulmonary
surfactant, as it is rich in phospholipid-binding proteins (21). Surfactant is produced
by type-II pneumocytes, that express high levels of ACE-2 receptors and are
effectively destroyed during severe COVID-19 (8, 14). Pneumocyte necrosis leads to
surfactant leakage and the peptide commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and
surfactant proteins may expose phospholipid protein structures for mimicry. Indeed,
a high coverage of peptide commonalities has recently been demonstrated by
Kanduc D. et al., who found that almost half of the immunoreactive epitopes on the
spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 share pentapeptides on human surfactant-related
proteins (22). In practice, preliminary results of the COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY)
trial demonstrate a significant benefit of dexamethasone therapy for severely ill
patients (23), suggesting the role of immune exacerbation in COVID-19 related

deaths. The effects of aPL could be further enhanced by toll-like receptor-4, which is
upregulated in SARS (24) and has been shown to enhance hypercoagulation (25).
Importantly, our data further supports a link between IgA and Kawasaki disease-like
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (26), since Kawasaki
disease can be triggered by respiratory viruses and severe forms are associated with
organ deposits of IgA-producing plasma cells (27, 28).
Potential limitations of the study are its cohort sizes and retrospective design.
Nevertheless, the inclusion of a discovery and an independent confirmation cohort
from different health care centers is as well as similar age among cohorts are major
strengths of the study. These data contribute to our understanding of the potential
role of autoimmunity in severe COVID-19.

In conclusion, we present a novel significant association between severe COVID-19,
elevated total IgA and IgA-aPL. These findings suggest that autoantibodies may be
causally linked to COVID-19 severity and thrombosis. We hypothesize that COVID19 is a potent inductor of autoimmunity and recommend further studies with larger
cohorts and mechanistic exploration to validate these findings.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Antibodies with a significant association with severe COVID-19 in both
cohorts (discovery and confirmation). Plot titles indicate the respective protein
targets and type of immunoglobulin. Y-axes reflect measured results and units. Xaxes display patient counts.

Figure 2. Antibodies with no or only partial significance with severe COVID-19. Plot
titles indicate the respective protein targets and type of immunoglobulin. Y-axes
reflect measured results and units. X-axes display patient counts.

Figure 3. Heatmap of the hierarchical clustering of antibody levels across patients.
Clustering depicts common shifts of antibody levels among patients with mild illness
and severe COVID-19. Rows display antibody levels and columns list patients. All
antibody levels are median centered and are displayed as fold relative compared to
the median, with higher titers displayed in red and lower titers in blue. For missing
results, the mean value of the respective antibody/immunoglobulin was used. The
scale bar (bottom center) denotes the x-fold levels.

IQR: interquartile range; No.: number; yr: years. * Comorbidities only consider diagnoses that are known risk factors for developing
severe COVID-19, as listed. † Immunosuppression is defined as systemically applied prednisone ≥7.5mg/day (or equivalent), other
systemic immunosuppressive drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, and chemotherapy.
Percentages adding to >100 are due to number rounding.
