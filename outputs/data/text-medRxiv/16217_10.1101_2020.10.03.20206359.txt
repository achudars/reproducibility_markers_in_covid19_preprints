PREDICTIONS FOR EUROPE FOR THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
AFTER LOCKDOWN WAS LIFTED USING AN SIR MODEL

Abstract. I analyze a simplified SIR model developed from a paper written by Gyan
Bhanot and Charles de Lisi in May of 2020 to find the successes and limitations of their
predictions. In particular, I study the predicted cases and deaths fitted to data from
March and its potential application to data in September. The data is observed to fit
the model as predicted until around 150 days after December 31, 2019, after which many
countries lift their lockdowns and begin to reopen. A plateau in cases followed by an
increase approximately 1.5 months after is also observed. In terms of deaths, the data
fits the shape of the model, but the model mostly underestimates the death toll after
around 160 days. An analysis of the residuals is provided to locate the precise date of
the departure of each country from its accepted data estimates and test each data point
to its predicted value using a Z-test to determine whether each observation can fit the
given model. The observed behavior is matched to policy measures taken in each country
to attach an explanation to these observations. I notice that an international reopening
results in a sharp increase in cases, and aim to plot this new growth in cases and predict
when the pandemic will end for each country.

1. Introduction
The novel Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus, first appearing in Wuhan, China at around December 31,
2019, has caused an ongoing worldwide pandemic. It differs from the initial Sars-CoV virus strain
in a multitude of ways, from its only 79 percent similarity to the original [8], to a wider range
of mortality rates. While the Sars-CoV strain had about a 9.6 percent mortality[6], this new
coronavirus has death rates ranging from 13.9 percent in Italy to 3.1 percent in the US[5]. Despite
this, it appears to have a more favorable transmission rate and a prolonged latency period. Since
the onset of a global lockdown earlier in the year, many countries throughout the world have begun
reopening, albeit not in full. Nonetheless, the measures taken by governments during quarantine
have significantly eased, although many countries continue to encourage proper social distancing
measures, from wearing masks to staying 6 feet apart. Around 140 days after December 31, 2019,
an SIR model[10] was created to model the flow of this novel coronavirus in the European countries
of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the UK, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France[4]. The
lack of a common policy amongst the world has led to different responses and outbreaks in different
countries, as we will come to see. Varying reopening policies between each country has resulted in
varying levels of success in virus containment, with some countries almost entirely shutting down
the virus and other countries seeing a plateauing and subsequent growth in cases.
2. A summary of the Model
In my study, I focus on the two differential equations modelling the S and I part of the SIR
model, meaning Susceptible and Infected, respectively. This uses the variables X1, denoting S,
X2, denoting I, α, the transmission rate (number of infections per day per contact), γ, the rate at

which individuals leave the infected population, N, the total individuals in an interacting pool of
Susceptibles, δ, the fraction of individuals who die after being infected, and P, the maximum value
of X2. The fits for the amount of deaths are found by scaling the cases by δ and shifting the graph
forward by a certain amount of days.
3. Relevant Equations
All of the relevant equations used to build the model are taken from the paper that develops the
model[4]. The primary equations used to graph the curves are:
(3.1)

dX1
= −αX1X2
dt

dX2
= αX1X2 − γX2
dt
Finding the residuals themselves is an easy enough equation: If R = the value of the residual, x
= the observed number of cases or deaths at a point in time, and X2 = the predicted number of
cases or deaths at a point in time using the main curve, then
(3.2)

(3.3)

R(t) = x(t) − X2(t)

The associated error bars to each residual are found from subtracting the observed number of cases
or deaths from the predicted number of cases or deaths at a point in time using each value of the
error bar curve.
To each point in time, I also associate a p value denoting the probability of finding the observed
data result if the model was true. This is a matter of a simple hypothesis test.
(3.4)

H0 : µ = X2(t)

(3.5)

Ha : µ 6= X2(t)

The standard deviation is found by using its formula and the values X2U and X2L representing the
upper and lower bounds from the estimation model:
r
2
2
2 (X2L − X2) + (X2U − X2) )
(3.6)
2
Using the formula, we can then find the corresponding z score and the area under the curve representing the p value using
x(t) − X2(t)
σ
Alternatively, using the pnorm function in R yields the same results.

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Reasons for Data Analysis tools. In this exploration, both residual plots and p value plots
(at the α = 0.05 level corresponding to a 95 percent level of confidence) are utilized to find results.
We can observe both the advantages and drawbacks to each tool, which provide a need for the
other. With a residual plot, we can better analyze how far each data point falls from the predicted
value on a linear scale. This clears up the confusion of distances on the log scale, as the model may
show an overprediction of 1000 to be miniscule in comparison to an overprediction of 10 based on
the data point’s location on the y axis. We also gain a better understanding of both how well the
data fits the model and when the data starts and stops fitting the model. The drawback, however,
is a lack of knowledge of whether a certain residual is expected from the data for the same reason

that there is a distinction between the aforementioned difference of 1000 and 10. The error bars
expand as time goes on, encompassing a larger expanse of area, but deceptively accounting for a
less inclusive interval of error. It is useful to gather whether an observed data point’s deviation
from the model is expected or not. A statistical analysis into the probability of observing such an
extreme or more extreme data point tells us that even a large difference of 1000 can be expected
given a large standard deviation as dictated by the error bars. A problem, however, arises when the
R value derived from the model[4] increases. As R increases, the fit becomes tighter and tighter,
decreasing the standard deviation, potentially making even a deviation of 10 seem probabilistically
impossible. This is where a look at the residuals clears up the problems caused by small standards
of deviation. In other words, residuals are particularly useful when studying smaller values, while
p values are more useful when studying larger values. A final useful note is that all labeled days
represent days starting after December 31, 2019 (January 1, 2020 is Day 1).
4.2. Analysis of the Case Model. In general, the model matches the observed data points well
until around Day 150. We note an initial almost linear climb in log space, accounting for an
exponential growth of the virus. We note a maximum point at a median of about 40 days after the
first case detected in the country, followed by a more gradual drop in cases. Instead of seeing a
continuous decrease in cases, we observe a plateau, sometimes followed by a small drop in cases, and
then a rise which on occasion exceeds the initial peak. This plateau starts at different locations, most
after an initial drop in cases, but some at the peak itself. The peaks of each country vary, and we can
see a clear relationship between a country’s population and their number of cases. Looking at the
number of cases per million population, however, does not show any such relationship, suggesting
that this factor depends more on federal action rather than just population and population density.
We notice that both the UK and Sweden plateau immediately after peaking, making the model
mostly inaccurate for both countries. For this reason, we can’t do a p value analysis. Along a
similar vein, the observed drop in cases for Italy didn’t match the model as the drop was much
more gradual than expected, and for that reason the model is mostly inaccurate for this country as
well. For every other country, the data points began to deviate from the model at about Day 142
± 20 days. These plateaus lasted for about 42.75 ± 15 days, with the exception of Norway, with an
83 day plateau. Given the relatively small size of the outbreak in Norway, it is expected that there
would be a thickly shaped plateau in cases due to the smallness of the numbers involved. It can
also be argued that France doesn’t have a plateau at all, instead going from a decrease in cases to a
sudden increase. Another interpretation would be to observe a wide plateau akin to the shapes of
Norway and Denmark, followed by a rise in cases. We notice an increase in cases in every country,
with most increases being sharply exponential (with the exception of Sweden). We also observe a
small decline in cases right prior to the aforementioned increase (with the exception of Spain and
Germany), suggesting that many countries had the potential to drop their cases once again before
whatever event caused them all to grow so suddenly. Finally, we observe this rise in cases to occur
roughly in the same timeframe: from Day 190 to day 205. We can likely attribute this to a policy
either made by the EU or by each government in close proximity to the other regarding reopening.
We’ll explore this in a later section. The residual plots were useful when attaching a rough start
date to the plateau, as it roughly corresponds to a deviation from the Covid model. A point and its
error bars not intersecting with 0 whose future points also do not intersect with 0 is thus marked
as a starting point to locate these plateaus. As time went on, the model predicted the virus to be
gone in most countries before Day 180[4], with the exception being the UK at around Day 210.
After around Day 170, the model predicts small X2 values with small standards of deviation, so
observed residuals at this point mostly represent the growth of the virus itself during that time.
We can clearly see an exponential increase both in the model and in the residual plots at nearly

identical times for this reason. Similarly, we mark the date in which the observed data points are
first statistically improbable given the model curve and continue to be (mostly) improbable as the
date at which point the model becomes obsolete using our p value plots. This also matches quite
well with the start date of the plateau.
4.3. Analysis of the Death Model. We can observe a similar shape for each death graph as
that of the cases graph, but with the values on the y axis scaled down by whatever fraction δ was
found. We notice almost consistently that the model underestimates the total death rate after
its peak, with the exception of the Netherlands, which the model surprisingly overestimates. The
model accounts for deaths to be 0 at around 160 days for each country, but instead we see that
there are still deaths after the predicted end date, albeit very few. We can see this in our residual
plots, in which the graphs stabilize around 0 after around Day 160. This stabilization, however, is
not an indicator of the accuracy of the model, which is proven by the p values dropping below the
α = 0.05 level after roughly the same date, but because the deaths have also fallen to fairly small
numbers, usually around 1-10. The model fails around 15 days after cases plateau, because we
expect cases and deaths to decrease continually until they reach 0, but instead we get a stagnation
of the virus. It wouldn’t be apt in most cases to call this persistence of the virus a plateau, but
rather the failure of the model to graph a much less steep falling curve. We notice that the UK and
Italy almost immediately deviate from the expected curve after reaching its peak, and we can see
a much more gradual decrease in cases in both countries. In almost every residual plot, we see a
shape resembling a damped harmonic oscillation curve as the residuals approach 0. As x approaches
200 and beyond, we can say that if the residuals don’t go to and stay at 0, there’s an anomaly.
We observe this in the UK and in Sweden. In the UK, we notice a fluctuation between 0 and 125
from Days 163 onwards, indicating a stagnation in deaths. Each stagnation occurs during a period
of increased cases. While we may expect an increase in cases to signify an increase in deaths, it
might be useful to consider the possibility that the lethality of the virus itself has decreased, or
hospitals have adapted and become better equipped to help patients survive the virus. We know
that the virus takes a long time to mutate[9], and that its mutations are mostly inconsequential,
so we could choose to focus our analysis on hospitals. During the peak of the virus, hospitals were
mostly swabbing and testing severely symptomatic patients, arguably skewing the lethality of the
virus. Considering that case rises could be associated with increased numbers of both moderately
and severely symptomatic patients instead of just mostly severely symptomatic patients, we can
infer that the number of deaths wouldn’t have increased[3]. In addition to this, younger people are
getting the virus, leading to a greater survival rate, and hospitals themselves have become better at
preventing deaths, due to the efforts of medical researchers. All of this has continued to keep deaths
down. In fact, since we don’t see a surge in deaths as we see a surge in cases, it could be predicted
that deaths would increase after day 227 in order to compensate for the rise in cases, but it is also
entirely probable that the persistence and “plateau” that we see prior to day 227 is due to the surge
of cases in each country. It is also probable that it takes longer to die now with the virus than it
did before. Finally, an examination of the date of the first deaths in each country compared to the
days until the model began to deviate from its expected behavior yields no relation, indicating that
any failure of the observed data points to conform to the model is most likely due to the policy
measures taken in each country.
4.4. Policy Measures taken in each Country. We have seen almost uniform behavior amongst
all of the countries in the shape of their growth, but the days for each significant change in shape
vary. This begs the question, what changed? We know that it takes about 15.5 days for a person
who gets infected to be recognized as infected and to get removed from the population, so we can

infer that any action taken will have repercussions about 15 days later. However, seeing as this
number was recorded when mostly severely affected people were being diagnosed, it can be assumed
that it’ll take less time in the months of July and August to get diagnosed. After about 183 days
since December 31 2019 (July 1, 2020), the EU began lifting restrictions on nonessential travel
for some countries. This has caused a direct increase in the number of cases for Italy, Germany,
Spain, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, and to a much lesser extent, Sweden. We can
see these effects in the rise in cases in each country from Days 190 to 205. The UK announced
around 190 days since December 31 2019 that restaurants, bars, hotels, hairdressers, cinemas and
museums would reopen, causing a surge in cases almost immediately. Sweden, which imposed a
more voluntary lockdown, has experienced a more protracted outbreak than other countries, which
we can see by the plateauing of cases in Sweden, with the exception of a sudden spike and drop
in cases over the span of just a few days. In addition to this, every country on the list launched
some phase of reopening in July and August, further compounding the issue caused by opening
the borders[7]. This still begs the question, why did cases rise in this scenario but plateaued in
prior days? This is likely because countries initially began lifting lockdowns internally during the
Day 140-Day 160 period, launching their initial phases of reopening. These reopenings were largely
internal, allowing for mobility inside the country. In Germany, smaller shops began to reopen, and
the travel ban was lifted for EU member states. Italy ended travel restrictions, bars, restaurants,
shops as well as other public activities such as tourist locations opened. Such changes happened to
essentially every country, with restrictions being lifted in mid May (Day 130-Day 140). A smaller
scale reopening coupled with falling cases likely contributed to a smaller growth of the virus causing
a plateau, whereas larger scale reopenings in later months almost uniformly caused a significant rise
in cases. Spain in particular has been hit hard, with many cases in Aragon[2], the most heavy hit
county, due to infections with wandering seasonal fruit pickers. Nonetheless, while cases continue
to increase, only about 3 percent of cases need hospital treatment, and the mortality rate is as low
as 0.3 percent in some areas. This provides a cause for hope, but also indicates an inaccuracy in
the Covid model in both its measurements of the fraction of cases that result in deaths and in the
time it takes for an infected person to die.
4.5. A new model to chart the post Lockdown Case Growth. We then sought to chart
the new growth of Covid-19 using the same equations as before. Using the times indicated by
our analysis, we charted the new wave of cases. We found that the time before a person removes
him/herself from the population (1/γ) increases dramatically, as well as the infectivity rate α.
However, we notice no upward trends in deaths as of yet, and any increase in deaths is slow and not
profound as of yet, suggesting that while cases are indeed on the rise, the death rate has stabilized.
This can be linked to younger people getting the virus, as older age patients are more susceptible
to receiving the virus[1]. An appropriate residual graph analysis shows that the residual cases have
mostly dropped, with some exceptions. We can’t do a p value analysis due to the tightness of
the graphs in addition to the flatter shape of the incline and the odd rises and falls due to the
peculiarities of each country’s reopening format. We plot the best case scenario for each of these
countries, as we see a general easing of the growth and a parabolic curve in each plot. We were
unable to do so for Sweden due because we failed to observe a sharp rise in cases akin to the initial
growth. The assumption thus is that the trend will continue downwards as it is predicted, which
will likely require a continuation of the current reopening phase without the introduction of more
radical changes that may shift the data. Studying the parameters, we observe that not only has
the value for gamma significantly decreased for all of the countries, the value for alpha has too.
In the Netherlands, the value for gamma drops from 0.05676 to 0.02647, in Denmark from 0.06 to
0.028, in Norway from 0.08 to 0.0355, in the UK from 0.0268 to 0.00716, in Germany from 0.0676

to 0.023, in Italy from 0.0556 to 0.0222, in Canada from 0.0267 to 0.008, in France from 0.06657
to 0.02, in the USA from 0.1676 to 0.00972, and in Spain from 0.689 to 0.0178. Similarly, in the
Netherlands, the value for alpha drops from 9.07e-5 to 2.539e-5, in Denmark from 0.000329 to
6.205e-5, in Norway from 0.0005448 to 0.0003996, in the UK from 3.62e-5 to 8.528e-6, in Germany
from 2.308e-5 to 2.472e-5 (increasing slightly in this scenario), in Italy from 2.588e-5 to 3.45e-5 (also
increasing slightly here), in Canada from 7.94e-5 to 2.858e-5, in France from 2.889e-5 to 3.327e6, in the USA from 1.04e-5 to 2.518e-6, and in Spain from 2.348e-5 to 4.141e-6. A decrease in
gamma indicates that each infected person is taking more time to remove himself/herself from the
population, suggesting that the symptoms and harm to them is significantly less. A lower alpha
value indicates a lesser transmission rate, which aligns with the prediction that younger people are
getting the virus. Younger people have a lesser history with preexisting conditions and are generally
stronger and in better shape to fight the virus. If younger people are stronger in general and show
less symptoms, it follows naturally that they would take longer to go to the hospital. Taking X2
< 5 to be the day that the pandemic ends, we conclude that it will end in the Netherlands on day
549 (July 2, 2021), in Denmark on day 505 (May 19, 2021), in Norway on day 383 (January 17,
2021), in the UK on day 804 (March 14, 2022 if we take 50 as our parameter), in Germany on day
384 (January 18, 2021), in Italy on day 580 (August 2, 2021), in Canada on day 712 (December
12, 2021 if we take 50 as our parameter), in France on day 750 (January 19, 2022), in the USA on
day 900 (June 18, 2022 if we take 100 as our parameter), and in Spain on day 774 (February 12,
2022). While this is the expected fit, we hope for a vaccine to be found, or the development of herd
immunity, which may reduce the time for the virus to be removed from the population.
5. Conclusion
This paper thus aims to provide a general shape to the future of the Covid-19 virus, and an
examination of which policy measures resulted in a growth in cases. In almost every European
country, we see the case model begin to fail at around Day 150, at which point the cases stagnate,
then increase starting at around Day 190. This increase in cases is nowhere close to reaching the
peaks of the initial outbreak, even though we see a sudden increase in the case count. This owes to
the deceptive nature of space in the log scale, where a sudden increase from 400 to 900 is seen as
more dramatic than an increase in the thousands. Spain, however, is dealing with another major
outbreak, with cases approaching that of its first peak. The model also largely underestimates
deaths and the continued persistence of deaths after Day 160. It also overestimates the lethality
and underestimates the time to die in later months after around June. The deviation of the observed
data points from the expectations set by the model of the model can be understood to be due to its
inability to account for reopening, instead assuming that each country would remain in a state of
total lockdown until deaths go to 0. It also fails to account for the outbreak amongst younger people,
and thus overestimates the survival rate. Nonetheless, before the lifting of lockdown, the model fits
the data quite well. An attempt to extrapolate the results of this model to Asian countries was
attempted, but many countries there are still fighting the virus, seeing a growth in cases. Others
observed a small peak around April, and are suddenly seeing a dramatic resurgence in August, akin
to the peaks of the European countries in April. While the model could be adapted to the cases
in August, an analysis of the data wouldn’t be appropriate until much after cases have subsided.
Nonetheless, this paper aims to change the notions of the general public as to the situation of the
Covid-19 virus, that contrary to popular opinion, it is still at large, and affecting a younger crowd.
It also aims to provide an answer to what forms of reopening are still acceptable to reducing net
cases, to which mostly internal reopenings are suggested. It finally looks to model the new growth
of Covid-19 in the 9 European countries in addition to two new North American countries.
