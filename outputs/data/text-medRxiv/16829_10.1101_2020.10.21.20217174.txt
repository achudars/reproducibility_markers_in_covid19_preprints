Introduction: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused a marked increase in all-cause
deaths in the United States, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. Because younger adults
have far lower infection fatality rates, less attention has been focused on the mortality burden
of COVID-19 in this demographic.

Methods: We performed an observational cohort study using public data from the National
Center for Health Statistics at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and CDC Wonder. We analyzed all-cause mortality among adults ages 25-44 during the
COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Further, we compared COVID-19-related deaths in
this age group during the pandemic period to all drug overdose deaths and opioid-specific
overdose deaths in each of the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions during the
corresponding period of 2018, the most recent year for which data are available.

Results: As of September 6, 2020, 74,027 all-cause deaths occurred among persons ages 25-44
years during the period from March 1st to July 31st, 2020, 14,155 more than during the same
period of 2019, a 23% relative increase (incident rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.21–1.24), with a peak
of 30% occurring in May (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.27-1.33). In HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey),
HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas), and HHS Region 9
(Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), COVID-19 deaths exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid
overdose deaths during at least one month. Combined, 2,450 COVID-19 deaths were recorded
in these three regions during the pandemic period, compared to 2,445 opioid deaths during the
same period of 2018.

Meaning: We find that COVID-19 has likely become the leading cause of death—surpassing
unintentional overdoses—among young adults aged 25-44 in some areas of the United States
during substantial COVID-19 outbreaks.

Note: The data presented here have since been updated. As a result, an additional 1,902 all-cause deaths
occurring among US adults ages 25-44 during the period of interest are not accounted for in this
manuscript.

COVID-19 has caused a marked increase in all-cause deaths in the United States, mostly

1,2

among adults aged >65.

Because younger adults have far lower case fatality rates, little

attention has been focused on the mortality burden of COVID-19 in this demographic.

Accordingly, we sought to identify changes in all-cause mortality (excess deaths) and to

determine years of lost life (YLL) among US adults aged 25-44. As the leading cause of death in

this demographic prior to COVID-19 was drug overdoses, we compared the monthly incidence

rates of COVID-19-specific deaths during the pandemic to unintentional overdose deaths (all

drug and opioid-specific) during the corresponding period in 2018 in each of the ten Health and

Human Services (HHS) regions.

Methods
We performed an observational study by assembling the most recent publicly available data

for all-cause mortality (2019–2020), unintentional drug overdose deaths (ICD10 X41-X44, Y11-

Y15, 2018), unintentional opioid-specific deaths (ibid and T40.0-6, 2018), and COVID-19 deaths

3,4

(ICD10 U071).

We calculated death incident rates per 100,000 person-month with 95%

confidence intervals (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Carey, NC).

We computed YLL due to COVID-19 and for all-cause excess mortality occurring from March–

5

July 2020 to assess undetected burdens resulting from COVID-19 undercounting.

Excess

mortality was defined as deaths in 2020 minus 2019 deaths during the corresponding period.

Incident rate ratios were also calculated.

This study was not subject to institutional review approval because it used publicly available

data. STROBE reporting guidelines were followed.

Results
From March–July 2020, 74,027 all-cause deaths occurred among persons ages 25-44 years,

14,155 more than during the same period of 2019, a 23% relative increase (incident rate ratio

1.23; 95% CI 1.21–1.24), with a peak of 30% occurring in May (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.27-1.33). In

HHS Regions 2 (New York, New Jersey), HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico,

Oklahoma, Texas), and HHS Region 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), COVID-19 deaths

exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid overdose deaths during at least one month (Figure).

Combined, 2,450 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in these three regions during the pandemic

period, compared to 2,445 opioid deaths during the same period of 2018.

In March-July 2018, opioid overdoses caused 10,347 deaths nationwide, resulting in 472,608

YLL among adults 25-44. During the similar period in 2020, 4,055 recorded COVID-19 deaths in

adults 25-44 resulted in 175,631 YLL (Table). Further considering all of the 14,155 excess deaths

in 2020, younger adults accounted for 627,872 YLL, exceeding YLL from overdose-related

deaths (595,175 YLL) during the corresponding period of 2018 (Table). Among adults 25-44,

28.7% (4,055 of 14,155) of the all-cause excess deaths were attributed to COVID-19.

Discussion
We find that COVID-19 has likely become the leading cause of death—surpassing unintentional

overdoses—among young adults aged 25-44 in some areas of the United States with

substantial COVID-19 outbreaks. In these regions, COVID-19 mortality also resembles that of

6

the HIV/AIDS epidemic at its apex in the United States (1994-1995).

We also found that a relatively small fraction of the all-cause excess deaths recorded during

the pandemic have been attributed directly to COVID-19. This gap has not yet been explained,

though a combination of inadequate testing and the continuation of pre-existing smaller

increases in all-cause mortality recorded during January–February 2020 may explain a large

fraction of this difference, implying that the mortality of COVID-19 has been substantially

1

under-detected in the younger adult population.

This study has limitations. The provisional data used represents lower-bound estimates due to

reporting lags. While the magnitude of our findings may increase as COVID-19 spreads among

younger populations, emerging treatments might improve fatality rates.

Together, these data indicate that the mortality of COVID-19 among adults ages 25-44 is

sizeable and should not be discounted by individuals or policymakers.
