Abstract
Background
The burden and impact of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections is unknown. We aimed to
examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 combined with detailed epidemiological
analysis to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform infection control
measures.
Methods
We set up rapid viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from PCR-positive diagnostic samples using
nanopore sequencing, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 hours. We established a
rapid review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to
investigate suspected cases of healthcare-associated COVID-19.
Results
Between 13 March and 24 April 2020 we collected clinical data and samples from 5191 COVID19 patients in the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples, producing 747 complete viral
genomes. We conducted combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of 299 patients at our
hospital and identified 26 genomic clusters involving 114 patients. 66 cases (57.9%) had a strong
epidemiological link and 15 cases (13.2%) had a plausible epidemiological link. These results
were fed back to clinical, infection control and hospital management teams, resulting in infection
control interventions and informing patient safety reporting.
Conclusions
We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and
demonstrated the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation
of healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic
transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection control interventions to reduce
further healthcare-associated infections.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the human population in December 20191, originating from an
intermediate animal host2. Owing to the error prone nature of the viral replication process, RNA
viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, accumulate mutations over time which results in sequence
diversity. The current mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be ~2.5 nucleotides per
month3,4. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can provide valuable information on virus biology,
transmission and population dynamics5–8. When linked with detailed epidemiological data and
performed in a timescale of days, genomic data can support epidemiological investigations of
potential hospital-acquired infections (HAI). On a larger population scale, genomic surveillance
of SARS-CoV-2 can inform which lineages of the virus are currently circulating in the human
population, how these change over time as an indicator of the success of control measures, how
often new sources of virus are introduced from other geographic areas, and how the virus evolves
in response to interventions.
Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) can affect patients, resulting in increased morbidity and
mortality, and healthcare workers (HCW), impacting on staff sickness and morale, to the detriment
of patient care. It is crucial to rapidly detect and manage HCAI effectively to prevent both
complications and onward transmission to susceptible patients and staff. The burden of
nosocomial COVID-19 infections is unknown but one study from China has reported a 41%
prevalence9 Worldwide, over 22,000 cases of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers have
been reported, but is likely to be an underestimate10. As the number of community-acquired
COVID-19 cases reduces, healthcare settings are likely to act as reservoirs of infection.
Identifying transmission events in these settings will therefore become increasingly important to
manage outbreaks and monitor effective infection control.
We aimed to examine the utility of rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, combined with detailed
epidemiological analysis, to investigate healthcare-associated COVID-19 infections and to inform
infection control measures in our hospital.

Methods
Study design, setting and participants
A prospective surveillance study of COVID-19 infections was conducted at Cambridge University
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH), a secondary care provider and tertiary referral centre in
the East of England (EoE). Clinical specimens collected from patients presenting to 18 hospitals
in EoE were submitted to the Public Health England Clinical Microbiology and Public Health
Laboratory (CMPHL) at CUH for diagnostic testing. Samples underwent nucleic acid extraction
and were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a validated in-house RT qPCR assay
developed by CMPHL (Supplementary Methods). The test was reported as SARS-CoV-2 PCR
positive if the cycle threshold (Ct) value was ≤36.
Study procedures
Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the hospital information system
(EPIC Systems Corporation, Verona, USA). All PCR-positive diagnostic samples were identified

and transferred from the CMPHL to the Department of Virology for nanopore sequencing. All CUH
samples and a selection of samples from East of England hospitals were selected for sequencing.
Sequencing
Where Ct values were available prior to sample selection, positive samples with a Ct value ≤33
were sequenced using a multiplex PCR based approach according to the modified ARTIC v2
protocol v3 primer set11,12. Amplicon libraries were sequenced using MinION flow cells v9.4.1
(Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Genomes were assembled using reference-based
assembly and a bioinformatic pipeline13 using 20x minimum coverage cut-off for any region of the
genome and 50.1% cut-off for calling single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Genomic analysis
All sequences underwent quality control (QC) filtering and de-duplication to remove repeat
samples from the same patient. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT14.
Phylogenetic trees were produced using IQ-TREE15 and visualised in Microreact16 for weekly
hospital reports and the R package ggtree17. A pairwise SNP distance matrix was produced from
the alignment (Supplementary Methods). Viral lineages18 were assigned with the PANGOLIN
package (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin) v1.07.
Epidemiological analysis
Patient movement data for all SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples were extracted from the
hospital information system and transferred to the PHE Field Service (Epidemiology).
Epidemiological analysis was performed using a cloud-based plotter application (Cluster Track,
Camart Ltd, Cambridge, UK).
Review of healthcare-associated infections
Clusters of COVID-19 cases including HCWs were identified by the clinical and infection control
teams and reviewed at a weekly meeting, co-ordinated by the Patient Safety team. The genomic
and epidemiological analyses were presented, to help determine whether infections were
healthcare-associated and to identify possible causes and interventions. A weekly report was fed
back to the clinical, infection control and hospital management teams to inform changes in
infection control practice and comply with patient safety procedures.
Ethical considerations
The study was conducted as part of surveillance for COVID-19 infections under the auspices of
Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006. It therefore did not require individual patient consent or ethical
approval. The COG-UK study protocol was approved by the Public Health England Research
Ethics Governance Group.

Results
Baseline characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic curve
368 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted to CUH between 10 March and 24 April
2020 (Figure 1, Table 1). The median age was 66 years (range 0 to 98 years) and 63% were
male. 19.6% of patients were admitted to critical care units and 20.1% died. Between 13 March

to 24 April 2020 1000 samples were selected for sequencing and, after QC and de-duplication,
747 were used for downstream analysis (Supplementary Figure 1). 256/368 (69.6%) of CUH
COVID-19 admissions had sequencing data available (Supplementary Table 1). 52/368 (14.1%)
of admissions were suspected or highly likely hospital-acquired, of which 47 (90.4%) had genome
sequences available. A further 10.3% of admissions were community-acquired but likely
healthcare-associated, and 2.2% were healthcare workers (Supplementary Table 1). The CUH
epidemic curve showed that weekly admissions peaked in week 4 (commencing 30 March 2020)
and then declined (Figure 2). The UK went into full lockdown on 23 March 2020. In the early
stages of the epidemic community-onset community-acquired infections predominated but the
frequency of healthcare-associated infections increased over time.
Genomic analysis
Each week a sample set was locked and underwent bioinformatic analysis. Out of 1,000
sequenced genomes, 253 were excluded from downstream analysis because they failed to pass
QC thresholds, metadata were missing or they were repeat samples from the same patient
(Figure 1). The median genome depth of coverage was 6,612x. We compared Ct value versus
depth of coverage and found that the latter declined at Ct values >30 (Supplementary Figure 2).
We also examined the location and frequency of SNPs across the genomes (Supplementary
Figure 2). Genomes were assigned to a lineage based on the combination of mutations that have
accumulated since the virus emerged. As of 23 March 2020, 12 lineages had been described in
the UK19 . The vast majority of samples in both the EoE and CUH belonged to lineage B.1. There
were no lineage A samples, which have mainly been identified in China, USA, South Korea and
Australia18 (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 3).
Phylogenetic trees were used to explore potential genetic clustering and correlation with sampling
ward location and/or cases of suspected HAI (Figure 4). Samples collected from the Emergency
Department (ED) were phylogenetically dispersed, likely reflecting unconnected recent
transmission events in community-acquired infections (Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast,
samples collected from several wards in CUH and an outpatient dialysis unit were genetically
clustered (Figure 4). The putative ward clusters include a high proportion of suspected HAI,
suggestive of linked transmission chains in the hospital.
Due to its recent introduction into the human population, SARS-CoV-2 has low genetic diversity;
here, a median of 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) separated any two samples at CUH
(Supplementary Figure 5). This low sequence diversity makes interpretation of putative clusters
challenging, as samples may be identical “by chance” rather than because of a recent connected
transmission chain. To investigate genomic clustering further we adopted a combined genetic,
clinical and epidemiological approach. Samples with zero SNP differences were identified and
clusters named numerically by decreasing sample size (Supplementary Table 2).
Overall 114 genomes in 26 clusters shared at least one identical sequence. The two largest
clusters each had 15 identical genomes. Patients’ medical records (including address, social
setting, clinical details and ward movements) were reviewed for all putative genomic clusters to
assess whether cases had plausible or likely linked recent transmission (Supplementary

Methods). Of 114 cases from 26 putative clusters, 63 cases (55.3%) had strong epidemiological
evidence to support recent transmission, 27 cases (23.7%) had intermediate evidence, and 24
(21.1%) no evidence of connected transmission. Clusters with strong evidence of linked recent
transmission include cases where a connection was already suspected, such as groups of likely
HAI seen on several CUH hospital wards (Figure 4), and clusters that were previously not
recognised as being linked, such as a care home outbreak involving HCWs based in hospital and
community settings. These are described further below.
Application and impact of combined epidemiological and genomic analyses
Directed by clinical and infection control teams we established a process to conduct focused
genomic and epidemiological analyses of suspected HAI cases (Supplementary Figure 6). These
were discussed in weekly meetings with an accompanying written report submitted to the hospital.
Anonymised examples are described here.
Hospital cluster 1. Six surgical patients on ward A (a non-COVID area) were diagnosed with
COVID-19 infection (Figure 4B). All cases had been on the ward for >14 days prior to their
specimen date and were classified as probable HAI. Genomic data were available for all cases;
five differed by zero SNPs and one by a single SNP, consistent with recent ward-based
transmission events. In response to this, universal mask use was introduced.
Hospital cluster 2. Four transplant patients on ward B (a non-COVID area) were diagnosed with
COVID-19 infection between 3 and 20 April 2020 (Supplementary Figure 7A). A fifth patient, who
had been recently discharged from the ward, presented to the ED with COVID-19 infection.
Genomic analysis revealed that all 5 cases had identical genomes. Three HCWs were found to
have identical genomes in the same cluster as the ward B cases; two had worked on ward B, one
of whom had professional contact with the other HCW. These findings led to a review of infection
control and PPE procedures for staff and patients in the transplant service.
Dialysis unit cluster. Renal dialysis patients are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 (up to
19% mortality20), with challenging infection control arrangements as most units consist of large
open rooms with no barriers between patients. Six patients with end-stage renal failure were
diagnosed with COVID-19 between 1 and 20 April 2020, testing positive in several locations
including ED and an acute admissions ward (Supplementary Figure 7B). Their viral genomes
were identical, and epidemiological investigation revealed they dialysed at the same outpatient
dialysis unit on the same days of the week. This suggests linked recent transmission of
community-onset healthcare-associated infections. These findings led to a review of infection
control procedures in dialysis patients and identified shared patient transportation as a possible
risk factor. Genomics can also be used to “rule out” linked transmission. The renal ward (which
shares patients with the outpatient dialysis unit) also had a group of COVID-19 cases at around
the same time. However, the dialysis unit genomes belonged to lineage B.2 (relatively rare in
EoE), whereas the renal ward genomes were the common B.1 lineage, making it very unlikely
that infections between the two patient groups were related.

Community cluster. Fifteen patients were admitted to CUH with COVID-19 between 7 and 21 April
2020 with genetically identical viruses. Eight patients were residents at a community care home
(care home A). A review of the medical records revealed that another patient in this genetic cluster
worked in care home A and one was a retired nurse who worked in an unknown care home. Two
cases were paramedics and two were nurses (who worked in different wards at CUH but lived
with paramedics). The final case did not have any discernible epidemiological links with the
others. In summary, this investigation revealed a cluster of cases with evidence of linked
transmission coming from the same care home with potential links between HCW and the care
home, none of which had been detected by clinicians or infection control.
The information from these combined epidemiological / genomic investigations was fed back to
the clinical, infection control, and hospital management teams. This triggered further
investigations of patient isolation, ward cleaning procedures, use of personal protective
equipment (PPE) and staff social distancing behaviour. HCAI were also assessed in relation to
potential harm caused to patients and recorded in hospital’s patient safety reporting system for
follow-up and further action.

Discussion
The value of real-time viral genome sequencing has been demonstrated in previous epidemics
21–26
We sought to embed genomic surveillance as part of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection control
process in a large UK hospital. A rapid sequencing workflow was established on 23 March 2020
using multiplex PCR-based nanopore sequencing, which has been proven to be effective in a
wide range of clinical samples and viral loads 27. We aimed to sequence all available positive
samples from CUH and a selection from each of the EoE regional hospitals submitted to the
diagnostic microbiology laboratory, linking with clinical metadata pulled from the hospital
electronic patient records system. We also included 44 samples collected as part of a local HCW
screening programme (Rivett et al, unpublished). In 5 weeks, over 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
had been sequenced including the majority of CUH samples from this phase of the epidemic. We
applied this system to investigate nosocomial and HCW COVID-19 infections at CUH, integrating
genomics with epidemiological and clinical data.
We examined the diversity in SARS-CoV-2 at CUH and found that overall genetic diversity was
low and reflected the pattern seen in the EoE as a whole, with most viruses belonging to the B.1
lineage. We identified a median of 8 (range 0 to 24) SNP differences between viruses, and 4.5%
of pairwise comparisons between CUH genomes had 0 to 1 SNP differences. Given the virus’s
mutation rate and infectious timeframe, cases may share linked recent transmission if there are
fewer than ~2 SNP differences. However, unravelling potential transmission networks requires
rapid integration with in-depth epidemiological data.
We investigated clusters of patients and HCW cases at CUH in response to queries from the
clinical and infection control teams. Using ward location data for patients and HCWs we performed
epidemiological analyses to determine if there had been ward-based contact. We compared the
genomes of patients and HCWs in the suspected clusters with those of other patients at CUH and
in EoE hospitals to examine relatedness. This approach enabled us to confirm or refute evidence

for transmission between patients and / or HCWs within these clusters. Genomic analysis also
enabled us to identify cryptic transmission i.e. additional cases that were not initially suspected to
be linked to the original ward or HCW clusters. We were also able to use genomic data to refute
suspected transmission events (e.g. different lineages between two isolates that were
epidemiologically linked), also important as a mechanism to monitor infection control measures.
These cases illustrate the power of combining rapid genomic and epidemiological analyses in
near real time. In contrast to previous studies28–31, we reported results of our investigations to the
clinical, infection control and management teams on a weekly basis, thus enabling them to
respond to this information and act accordingly within the timeframe of ongoing ward outbreaks.
The genomic data informed reviews of patient placement and isolation procedures, assessment
of PPE use and staff break arrangements, supporting us to better focus efforts at a time of
unprecedented demand on infection control teams. Finally, these analyses are currently being
used to inform existing patient safety review processes within our hospital, including investigations
related to hospital-onset COVID-19 where the patient has come to harm.
Our study highlights the importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission within
healthcare settings in managing the pandemic. The possible transmission networks that we have
identified were complex, involving patients and HCW in both community and hospital settings.
However, we have also identified potential transmission networks in other environments including
care homes, outpatient units and ambulance services, that have been poorly studied. Although
there are strong epidemiological and genomic associations between cases, the mechanism and
direction of transmissions remain unclear. The role of asymptomatic intermediates, fomites
(including PPE) and the environment are not well understood and require further investigation.
During the time frame of this study a number of infection control interventions were implemented
across the hospital, as well as national public health measures to reduce community spread.
Understanding the interaction between such interventions and nosocomial transmission are
complex (especially in the context of the comparably long incubation period for SARS-CoV-2
relative to other respiratory viruses), but critical in enabling healthcare providers to safely deliver
existing services in the context of a pandemic.
We acknowledge several limitations to our study. Firstly, we were unable to sequence all of the
genomes from samples that were collected during the study period. We may therefore have
missed the opportunity to investigate all potential transmission events. Furthermore, we only had
main ward location data for most of the HCW and could have overlooked potential epidemiological
links with patients with whom they had contact on other wards. Similarly, we were unable to track
HCW movements outside their main ward location to identify potential contact with patients on
other wards or HCW within shared communal areas. Finally, due to the recent introduction of
SARS-CoV-2 into the human population, highly similar genomes are not sufficient evidence to
infer a recent transmission, in the absence of confirmatory epidemiological data. However, our
experience indicates that further investigation of genomic clusters with highly similar genomes
can uncover previously unknown epidemiological links. Furthermore, we were able to use rapidly
generated genomic data to investigate HCAI within the hospital setting. The next initiative is to
expand this platform into a more detailed analysis of infections in HCW and in community settings,
such as residential homes. As the practical challenges associated with implementing real-time

genome sequencing during epidemics are overcome, unlocking the real power of genomic
epidemiology will require its integration with clinical and public health systems to support decisionmaking on local, national and international scales.

Supplementary Methods
SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing
Nucleic acid extraction was undertaken using the NUCLISENS easyMAG platform (Biomerieux,
Marcy L-Etoile), in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions. Nucleic acids were extracted
from 500µL of sample, with a dilution of MS2 bacteriophage added pre-extraction to act as an
internal extraction and inhibition control. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using an
in-house generated and validated one-step RT q-PCR assay that detects a 222 base-pair region
of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp genes, along with an MS2 bacteriophage internal extraction control.
The
RdRp
gene
was
detected
using
the
RdRp
For
primer
(ATGGGTTGGGATTATCCTAAATGTGA)
and
the
RdRp
Rev
primer
(AGCAGTTGTGGCATCTCCTGATGAG) with a FAM labelled MGB RdRp Probe 3
(ATGCTTAGAATTATGGCCTCAC). The internal extraction control was detected using the MS2
For
primer
(TGGCACTACCCCTCTCCGTATTCACG),
the
MS2
Rev
primer
(GTACGGGCGACCCCACGATGAC)
and
a
ROX-BHQ2
labelled
MS2
probe
(CACATCGATAGATCAAGGTGCCTACAAGC). Amplification reactions and detection of PCR
products were performed using the Rotorgene™ PCR instrument. A typical reaction contained
400nM of For and Rev primers for the RdRp genes and 200nM of the the MS2 internal control
For and Rev primer pair, along with 120nM of the RdRpand MS2 probes. Reactions typically
contained 25% extracted nucleic acid and were cycled through the following conditions 25°C
2min, 50°C 15min, 95°C 2min followed by 45 cycles of 95°C and 60°C. Samples that generated
a Ct value ≤36 were considered positive. Samples and negative control (molecular grade water)
were individually spiked with MS2 bacteriophage internal control (4600 pfu per extraction) prior to
nucleic acid extraction to identify any inhibitors or extraction issues. Positive control material,
BetaCoV/England/02/2020, was obtained from PHE Colindale and was essentially purified virus
RNA diluted down to give a cycle threshold value of 26-28. Negative controls included extracted
molecular grade water.
Sample and data collection
Sample collection, metadata curation and linkage to sequencing IDs involved coordination
between multiple teams and critically depended on good relations between the sequencing and
diagnostic laboratory staff (Supplementary Figure 1). Each day samples with positive SARS-CoV2 PCR results from the last 24 to 72 hours were identified from the hospital information system
and clinical metadata was extracted, formatted and integrated into a master metadata file. A 15
microlitre aliquot of the RNA extract of all CUH samples and a random selection of EoE samples
were collected from the diagnostic microbiology laboratory for local sequencing. These were
assigned COG-UK sequencing codes which were integrated back into the master metadata file.
For samples that were not sequenced locally, the remaining RNA extract was collected from the
diagnostic microbiology laboratory and sent to the Wellcome Sanger Institute for sequencing as
part of the COG-UK consortium. Each week, clinical metadata and sequencing data were
combined and formatted for upload to the MRC CLIMB system. Data manipulations were
performed in R (v 3.6.2) using the tidyverse packages (v 1.3.0) installed onto computers within
the Trust network.

Sequencing details
Samples were sequenced using Nanopore technology following the ARTICnetwork V3 protocol
(https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bbmuik6w) and assembled using the ARTICnetwork
assembly pipeline (https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html). Median
genome depth of coverage was 6,612x across all 747 genomes. 14 samples in our dataset were
also sequenced with Illumina technology at the Wellcome Sanger Institute as part of COG-UK.
There was 100% concordance in called nucleotides between sample pairs. Four genomes
differed because of base pairs called in the Illumina data that were missing in the Nanopore
sequences. The accession numbers of the samples included in this study are available in
Supplementary Table 4.
Bioinformatic analysis
Consensus fasta sequence quality control cutoffs were: size >29Kb, N count <2990 (~10%). After
QC filtering, de-duplication and matching with metadata, the first sample set analysed comprised
197 genomes collected up to 10th April 2020; set 2 had 444 genomes up to 15th April, and set 3
(presented here) had 747 genomes up to 24th April. 30 reference genomes were added to the
sample sets downloaded from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/; Supplementary Table 3). The
reference genomes were chosen to represent the major branches of the global phylogenetic tree
as visualised in Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/) to provide broader context, including a sample
from December 2019 collected in Wuhan, China, used to root the tree. Multiple sequence
alignment was performed using MAFFT (v 7.458) with default settings, command:
/PATH/mafft" --retree 2 --inputorder "multi_fasta.fasta" > "aligned_multi_fasta
The alignment was manually inspected using AliView. Maximum likelihood trees were produced
using IQ-TREE software15 for all samples passing QC filters and the subset of samples from
CUH (n=299 for this dataset). Initial tests with the ModelFinder Plus option32, which selects the
optimal nucleotide substitution model out of over 200 options
(http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Substitution-Models), consistently identified GTR+F+I as the best
model. Therefore from 24th April (including analysis presented here) we specified GTR+F+I.
Command using ModelFinder Plus:
/PATH/iqtree -s aligned_filtered_multi_fasta -m MFP
Command with GTR+F+I model specified:
/PATH/iqtree -s aligned_filtered_multi_fasta -m GTR+F+I
Trees were manually inspected in FigTree, rooted on the 2019 Wuhan sample (EPI ISL 402123),
ordered by descending node and exported as Newick files. Trees were visualised in online
software Microreact16 in a private account to explore relationships between wards and clinicoepidemiological questions for our weekly reports. Further visualisations were produced in R using
the packages Ape33 (v 5.3) and ggtree17 (v 2.0.4).
A SNP difference matrix was produced from the multiple sequence alignment using the snp-dists
package (v 0.7.0; https://github.com/tseemann/snp-dists; installed into a conda environment),
command:
snp-dists -c aligned_filtered_multi_fasta.aln > snp_dist_matrix.csv

The matrix was exported as .csv and manipulated in R using the Matrix and tidyverse packages
for ward and pairwise SNP comparisons and plotted using the ggplot2 (v 3.3.0) package. A
heatmap was produced in python using the seaborn (v 0.10.0) clustermap function. To identify
clusters with zero SNP differences we used the scipy.cluster.hierarchy functions linkage and
fcluster setting a maximum distance of zero (scipy v 1.4.1). Clusters were named in descending
size order and linked with sample metadata and lineage data.
Investigation of genetic clusters with zero SNP differences
Patient records from each case within a putative genomic cluster were manually reviewed in detail
by authors BW, WLH and MET and assigned a score of 1 (strong evidence supporting a recent
linked transmission chain, e.g. patients co-located on the same ward becoming positive within the
incubation period of the virus), 2 (a plausible transmission chain is present e.g. patients becoming
positive while located in nearby wards within the hospital but who did not appear to be in direct
contact), and 3 (no evidence of any transmission connections between cases).
Epidemiological analysis methods
Timeline plotting
Space time relationships between patients were plotted using patient specific time lines by
exporting the bed and ward admission dates, dates of transfer, dates of discharge or date of death
obtained from hospital information system (EPIC Systems Corporation, Verona, USA) and
importing them into a cloud-based timeline plotter application (Cluster Track, Camart Ltd,
Cambridge available at Clusterack.com). Earliest positive specimen date for COVID19 was
obtained from the laboratory records and date of onset of symptoms from the clinical records and
uploaded.
The application aided visualisation of ward and time relations by assigning unique colours to
wards and then ward presence by date along the x axis shown in days, such that a solid timeline
bar by colour and by date permitted the visualisation of the location of each patient over time. The
positive specimen date for COVID 19, genomic cluster, death and discharge were each overlaid
on the patient timeline using standard visual representation built into the application. Visualisation
was aided by using the sort command within the application on admission date, earliest positive
specimen date, or first ward to which admitted. Separate plots of subset of the total cases were
created to provide clearer visualisation when needed
Ward time and genomic cluster plots
A clustering and network analysis function was used in the Cluster track application in which an
algorithm links patients with admission days to the same ward on the same date and displays a
network diagram to indicate these overlapping cases.
More advanced space time clustering was undertaken by exporting these timeline data sets into
an SQL database running a more advanced clustering algorithm in which time parameters were
set for the presumed susceptible, infectious and non-infectious/ recovered intervals counting from
the earliest positive specimen date. The algorithm identified and linked cases in which two or
more patients had an overlap on the same ward of the time interval of infectiousness of an earlier

case with the interval of susceptibility in a later case or cases. Links continue to be made until no
further overlaps of the infectious interval in an earlier case occurred with the interval of
susceptibility in a later case on the same ward: this ended the space time cluster.
The cluster diagrams of the space time clustered cases were reviewed. Cases within the same
space time cluster that belonged to the same genomic cluster were deemed to be supportive of
a recent transmission event.

Supplementary Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time

In the weeks commencing 9 and 13 March 2020 lineages (and descendent lineages) of B, B.1, B.2, B.3 and B.8 were
present in the EoE (amalgamated here as there were only 2 samples for week commencing 9 March). Diversification
of lineages already present from earlier weeks was seen over time, with the detection of descendants of lineages B.1
and B.2, but no new lineages emerged during this period, likely an impact of lockdown measures preventing new
viruses being introduced from other regions. Changes in lineage frequency may be stochastic due to changes in the
available sample size during each week of the sampling period. Lineage B.8 was only detected in the week commencing
16 March 2020. Lineage B.4 viruses (associated with export from Iran) were not seen in our sample set. Lineage A
viruses (or A descendants), most commonly reported in China, USA, South Korea and Australia, were not detected in
our EoE samples.

Supplementary Figure 7. Epidemiological timelines of hospital clusters
7A. Hospital cluster 2 (Ward B)

Four transplant patients on ward B (shown in khaki) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between 3 and 20 April
2020. A fifth patient, who had been recently discharged from the ward, presented to the ED with COVID-19 infection.
The sample dates are shown in yellow circles (patients) and diamonds (HCW). Genomic analysis revealed that all 5
patients had identical genomes. Two HCW were found to have identical genomes in the same cluster as the ward B
cases; one had worked on ward B and had professional contact with the other HCW.

7B. Dialysis unit cluster

Six patients with end-stage renal failure were diagnosed with COVID-19 between 1 and 20 April 2020, testing positive
in several locations including ED and an acute admissions ward. The sample dates are shown in yellow circles. Their
viral genomes were identical, and epidemiological investigation revealed they dialysed at the same outpatient dialysis
unit. This suggests linked recent transmission of community-onset healthcare-associated infections.

Eight patients swabbed during a suspected
outbreak on ward 1. The first patient to be
swabbed was recently discharged from ward 2 and
then re-admitted to ward 3. The two HCWs worked
on ward 3; one had direct contact with the first
patient to be swabbed in this cluster. Two patients,
distinct from the larger outbreak, co-habit
(spouses). The final patient has no identifiable
association with any other case in this cluster.

8 patients were resident in the care home A. One
patient works as a carer in the same home.
Another patient also works as a carer in an
unspecified home. Two of the HCWs were
paramedics. The other two HCWs work in different
clinical areas, but both live with paramedics. One
patient had no identifiable contact with the other
cases in this cluster.
