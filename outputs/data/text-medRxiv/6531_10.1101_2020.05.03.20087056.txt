Covid-19 Pandemic in relation to levels of Pollution with PM2.5 and
Ambient Salinity – An Environmental Wake-up Call
Yves Muscat Baron

Mater Dei Hospital Medical School of the University of Malta

ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 infection continues to be a source of great loss of life
and global suffering, necessitating national lockdowns. There are however some
countries and cities which appear to have contained the pandemic. Common to these
countries are environmental factors including the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5)
and ambient salinity.
METHOD: PM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed in a number of cities,
differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed were
divided into two groups. The first group included cities having significantly high rates
of Covid-19 infection, while the second group consisted of coastal cities or small
island countries, all of which have low rates of Covid-19 infection. Minimum and
maximum levels of PM2.5 were obtained from the Air Quality Index, one month
before and one month after statutory lockdown. Salinity levels were obtained from a
study that assessed chloride ion wet deposition, a surrogate for ambient salinity.
RESULTS: One month prior to the statutory national lock-down or mandatory
restrictions, there appear to be high levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 67.4
- 118.7 AQI), in countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection
compared to lower levels in countries that have contained the infection (min-max 45.6
- 79.8) (p<0.046). One month after national restrictions there still appeared to be
higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (min-max 51 - 90.5 AQI), in countries
which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to countries that have
contained the infection (min-max 42.7 - 69.5 AQI) but this was not statistically
significant.
There seemed to be an inverse relationship between Covid-19 infection and ambient
salinity levels. Countries that were spared high Covid-19 infection rates, besides their
geographical isolation, also have higher ambient salinity levels (124 617mgCl/m2/TAG) compared to salinity levels noted in countries with high Covid-19
rates of infection (28.4 - 162. mgCl/m2/TAG) (p<0.003).
CONCLUSION: High levels of PM2.5 in the presence of low ambient salinity may
increase the risk of Covid-19 infection in the population. Addressing these two
environmental factors may attenuate the severity of the pandemic.
Keywords: Covid-19, environmental factors, PM2.5, ambient salinity.

INTRODUCTION
Covid-19 infection continues to wreak havoc, in several populations with great loss of
life, economies are at a standstill with unemployment increasing exponentially and
millions are threatened with starvation. There are however ‘islands of hope’ such as
the author's country, Malta, which appears to have contained the infection. There are
other “islands of hope” such as the Hong Kong, Cyprus, South Korea, New Zealand
and Taiwan.
There are common factors between these countries which appear to have contained
the Covid-19 pandemic. The most obvious common factor is geographical,
whereby most of these countries are in fact islands, except for South Korea which
however, because of its geopolitical circumstances, can be considered an
"island". This form of physical isolation allows the possibility of effective measures
ensuring successful social distancing, preventing large population movements which
may encourage spread of infection. National jurisdictions may be able to
function more efficiently in small populations. Legislation enforcing public health
measures such as social distancing and processes to protect the elderly and vulnerable
individuals may be more effective at reaching the general citizenship of a nation1.
The epicentres of Covid-19 infection such as Wuhan, Qom and Bergamo have high
population densities. Similarly in the USA, New York and New Orleans have both
high population densities and high incidences of Covid-19 infection. This was initially
thought to be a catalyst for the rapid Covid-19 spread; however there are other cities
spared from Covid-19 with higher population densities2. Moreover, the countries
mentioned earlier which appear to have contained the Covid-19 infection also have
high population densities3. As a corollary to high population densities, pollution levels
are relatively elevated in Wuhan, Qom and Bergamo as indicated by atmospheric
particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide and sulphur levels.
METHODOLOGY
The particulate matter PM2.5 and ambient salinity were assessed from a number of
cities, differentially affected by Covid-19 infection. The cities chosen to be assessed
were divided into two groups. The first group (Group 1) included Wuhan, Qom,
Bergamo, Paris, Madrid, London and New York, all having significantly high rates of
Covid-19 infection. Group 2 consisted of cities including Seoul, Napoli, Brest,
Eastbourne, Taipei, Hong Kong and small countries such as Malta and Cyprus, all of
which have very low rates of Covid-19 infection (WHO Report 2020)4.
Data on particulate matter (PM2.5) was obtained from the Air Quality Index, which is
updated in real time giving minimum and maximum levels for each day of the month5.
The levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) were calculated one month before and one
month after national statutory lock-downs or mandatory restrictions were instituted.
Eyeballing the colour coded depiction of the Air Quality Index the air pollution as
regards particulate matter (PM2.5) was worse even two months before national
statutory lock-downs or mandatory restrictions were instituted in Wuhan, Qom and
Bergamo. However to retain a standard time-line of one month, the data one month
before and after national statutory lock-downs or mandatory restrictions were assessed.

Data from Qom before lockdown was not available so that of Teheran before and after
lockdown was utilized.
Chloride Ion Wet deposition in mgCl/m2/Tag is used as an index of ambient salinity.
Data for ambient salinity was obtained from an indexed colour coded map compiled
by Fraunhofer ISE, through a site set up by the Galvanizers Association6. This site
determines the level of salinity in different regions in the world in connection with the
risk of automobile rusting. The data are given as a minimum and maximum level in
mgCl/m2/Tag.
RESULTS
There appears to be elevated levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (67.4-118.7 AQI), in
countries which had a high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels
in countries that have contained the infection (45.6-79.8) (p<0.046). One month after
national statutory lock-down or mandatory restrictions there still appeared to be
higher levels of particulate matter, PM2.5 (51-90.5 AQI), in countries which had a
high incidence of Covid-19 infection compared to lower levels in countries that have
contained the infection (42.7-69.5) but this was not statistically significant (p=n.s).
The countries that seem to have contained the pandemic are surrounded by sea,
increasing ambient salinity. Countries that evaded high Covid-19 infection rates have
higher ambient salinity rates 124-617mgCl/m2/TAG compared to 28.4-162.8
mgCl/m2/TAG (p<0.003) noted in countries sustaining high Covid-19 rates of
infection.
The results are demonstrated in two tables designated Figure 1 and Figure 2.

The p value between the two groups of countries/cities is p< 0.003. Group 1 had a
higher incidence of Covid-19 and similarly had a lower ambient salinity level in
mgCl/m2/Tag compared to the Group 2. (Data indicating the Chloride Ion Wet
Deposition, a variable reflecting the environmental salinity6).
DISCUSSION
With the benefit of foresight, “the islands of hope” instituted social distancing.
Besides reducing human to human viral transmission, physical distancing may have
impacted pollution levels due to lower levels of economic activity. This was the case
with Malta, whereby atmospheric pollution decreased by 70%. Before statutory
lockdown, there may be synergism between high PM2.5 levels and Covid-19
infection. Addressing this synergism may protect the populations from airborne
infections such as the Covid-19 infection and foster respiratory health. There appear
to be strikingly elevated pollution levels of PM2.5 a few weeks prior to the outbreak

of Covid-19 in Wuhan, Qom and Begamo5. These elevated levels of PM2.5 occurred
during the winter months presumably due to combustion of fuel for heating purposes.
Another ambient factor may come into play in the form of the level of atmospheric
salinity. A colour-coded map of the distribution of the earth's salinity has been
provided by Fraunhofer-ISE indicating the Chloride Ion Wet Deposition, a variable
reflecting the environmental salinity6. There may be a connection between the level of
ambient salinity and the rate of Covid-19 infection.
The level of salinity as indicated by the colour-coded map confirms the elevated
levels of Chloride Ion Wet Deposition in these countries. Wuhan has been noted to be
one of the cities with the least salinity in the air7. Moreover, eyeballing the disease
spread in some countries that have been hard hit by Covid-19 infection, there appears
to be a correlation of Covid-19 infection rates and ambient salinity as in Qom and
Bergamo. Other examples of this correlation are France and the U.K. The high
salinity Brittany (Brest) region had fewer infection rates compared to the central
(Paris) and eastern regions in France (lower salinity). Similarly, the South East region
of the U.K. with higher saline levels had lower Covid-19 infection rates compared to
London which appears to have a lower Chloride Ion Wet Deposition. This can also be
seen in Italy whereby the saline deficient Lombardy region ( Bergamo) was severely
affected by Covid-19 infection, while the more saline rich south of Italy ( Napoli)
have very low infection rates.
Healthy levels of endo-tracheal sodium chloride protect the respiratory airways from
disease. Ciliary action is improved when the saline content of the endobronchial tree
is optimal. Bronchial mucous is less viscous with optimal levels of sodium chloride.
In fact, patients with cystic fibrosis are administered hypertonic saline endobronchially to mobilize stagnant mucous plugs8.
The Covid-19 virus is hydrophobic and low concentrations of chlorinated solutions
are lethal to the virus. Ambient salinity may be another environmental factor that may
have protected some populations preventing airborne infection from the Covid-199.
Besides the lethal effect of sodium chloride on the virus, there may be a connection
with aerosol adhesion of sodium chloride with the pollutant PM2.5. In snowbound
countries, where salt is applied to roads to encourage snow to melt, aerosolization of
the salt together with PM2.5 has been noted10. The amalgamation of sodium chloride
to PM2.5 may consequently attenuate the inflammatory effect of the polluting particle.
Inflamed pulmonary tissue may act as an ideal pabulum for the Covid-19 virus to
adhere to the epithelium and the presence of sodium chloride may inhibit viral
adhesion and infective activity. Recent evidence suggests that Covid-19 may have
“piggy-backed” on to PM2.5 particles to evade the bronchial tree defences and
colonize the alveoli11. The presence of sodium chloride on PM2.5 particles may act as
a deterrent against the concomitant adhesion of Covid-19 to these particles, protecting
populations living in regions with high salinity.
From the above discussion, there may be a suggestion that the rapid and ruthless
global advance of Covid-19 infection may have occurred due to the combination of a
number of environmental factors besides the virulence of the virus. The increase in
pollution in particular PM2.5, and lack of ambient salinity may have acted in concert

to catalyse the pandemic. Measures to address these factors may prove useful to
reverse the onslaught of the Covid-19 Pandemic. The statutory lockdown indicated
that reduction in PM2.5 did occur when these restrictions were instituted. Reducing
pollution, diminishing PM2.5 in particular, is imperative. Populations living in
elevated levels of ambient salinity also appear to be protected. Instituting a synergistic
approach of reducing pollution combined with “salinating” measures of habitable air,
especially in enclosed spaces with nebulised saline, may protect populations from the
further advancement of the pandemic.
