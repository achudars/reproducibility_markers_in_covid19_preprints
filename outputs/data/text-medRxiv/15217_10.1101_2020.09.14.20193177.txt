Abstract
Background

: The impact of influenza and various types of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV)

on pregnancy has been reported. However, the current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues
to reveal important data for understanding its behavior in pregnant women.

Methods

: We analyzed the records of 326,586 non-pregnant women of reproductive age and 7,444

pregnant women with no other risk factor who also had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result to estimate
adjusted prevalence (aP) and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of COVID-19 and its requirement of
hospitalization, intubation,

ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Adjustment was done through

Poisson regressions for age and altitude of residence and birth. Generalized binomial models were
used to generate probability plots to display how each outcome varied across ages and altitudes.

Results

: Pregnancy was independently associated with a 15% higher probability of COVID-19 (aPR:

1.15), a 116% higher probability of its following admission (aPR: 2.169) and a 127% higher probability
of ICU admission (aPR: 2.275). Also, pregnancy was associated with 84.2% higher probability of
developing pneumonia (aPR: 1.842) and a 163% higher probability of its following admission (aPR:
2.639). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 case-fatality rates between pregnant and
non pregnant women (1.178, 95% CI: 0.68-1.67).

Conclusion

:

Pregnancy

was

associated

with

a

higher

probability

of

COVID-19,

developing

of

pneumonia, hospitalization, and ICU admission. Our results also suggest that the risk of COVID-19
and its related outcomes, except for intubation, decrease with altitude.

and immune response. As a consequence, the susceptibility to infection increases, in addition to the
risk of developing complications and even respiratory failure

(1-3)

.

In 2002, SARS-CoV infected 8,098 people with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 10.5%
MERS-CoV had a total of 2,519 confirmed cases and a CFR of 34.4%

(5)

(4)

, while in 2012

. On the other hand, in 2009,

cases of influenza A H1N1 were estimated at 60.8 million, and approximately 18,500 deaths were
reported

(6-7)

. These diseases have been shown to be more severe in pregnant women.

We are currently facing the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which has
already exceeded 20 million cases worldwide

(8).

Cases and deaths are increasing rapidly and we still

lack specific treatment for the disease, and although rates of hospitalization and admission to the
intensive care unit (ICU) are variable, health systems are already saturated.

Recent studies suggest the possibility that being pregnant may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2
infection and its complications

(9)

. Similarly, it was suggested that the infection rate of this virus

might be lower at high-altitude (over 2,500m)

(10)

. This study seeks to evaluate pregnancy and high-

altitude as factors that could intervene in the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the
severity of its presentation.

According to the protocols of the Mexican Ministry of Health, samples for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR are
taken from every patient with respiratory distress and one out of ten mild cases (ambulatory) in the

(“USMER”)

distributed

throughout

the

nation.

These

data

are

updated daily according to their “Open Data” policy, in which over a million confirmed, discarded or
suspected COVID-19 patients are reported to date.

Only registries of patients without any other known risk factor recorded besides pregnancy with
definite RT-PCR results (positive or negative) were included. Also, we only considered those who had
their place of current residence and birth in the record. This information was used to estimate the
mean altitude at birth and residence at the time of RT-PCR sampling, using an auxiliary dataset
provided by the Mexican Geology Service. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 326,586 nonpregnant women and 7,444 pregnant women were analyzed. In this study we define COVID-19 as
the individual who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and further separate the cases who had
the additional diagnosis of pneumonia to evaluate the clinical evolution in detail.

(p<0.0001) (Crude prevalences).

Most of pregnant women who developed COVID-19 pneumonia (5.06%; 95% CI: 4.5-5.6), required
hospitalization (84.08%; 95% CI: 80.0-87.4), a proportion that nearly quadrupled that of COVID-19
pregnant women admitted without pneumonia (24.26%; 95% CI: 22.8-25.7%). The case-fatality rate
of COVID-19 pregnant women with pneumonia was ten-fold of that of pregnant women without
pneumonia (11.67% [95% CI:8.8-15.3] versus 1.69% [95% CI:1.3-2.2], p<0.0001). Half of pregnant
women lived at altitudes above 1185 meters (50.03%, 3724/7444) and 25.02% lived in altitudes

In

, we show that the probability of COVID-19 increased with age for both pregnant and

non-pregnant women. However, it was always higher in pregnant women, with those over 35 years
found with a 50% or higher probability. The chance of developing pneumonia also increased with
age for both groups and never exceeded the 13.7% in pregnant women and 7.5% in non-pregnant
women

(Figure 2 – A-B)

. The probability of ICU admission in all COVID-19 cases

was higher in pregnant women older than 29 years old and women older than 25 years old in COVID19 pneumonia compared to non-pregnant women

(Figure 2 – C-D)

. Consistent with the adjusted

prevalence ratio found, no significant differences were found for case-fatality rates

(Figure 2 – E-F)

.

As for altitude, the probability trend of COVID-19 (all cases) registered a decreasing trend with
pregnant women who resided below 1,750 meters at increased risk and COVID-19 pneumonia for
those who resided below 2750 meters

(Figure 3 – A-B)

. The chance of admission also decreased with

increasing altitudes and was consistently higher in pregnant women

(Figure 3 – C-D)

. Pregnant

women had the same chance of intubation than no-pregnant across all altitudes (p>0.05), (

). The mean probability of ICU admission decreased with altitude but was significantly higher in

pregnant women with COVID-19 who lived above 750 meters and all altitudes above sea level in
pneumonia cases, compared to non-pregnant women

(Figure 4 – C-D)

. In contrast with the adjusted

prevalence ratio, the case-fatality rate was found to be lower in pregnant women with COVID-19
who lived above 1000 meters and lower in all pregnant women with pneumonia

(Figure 4 – E-F)

A systematic review of 538 pregnant women with COVID-19 identified that, according to Wu and
McGoogan’s

(17)

classification of disease severity, 86.1% had mild disease, 15.3% severe disease and

1.4% critical disease; while only 3.0% of cases were reported as ICU admissions

(18)

. Although the

Mexican dataset did not allow for a standard definition of COVID-19 pneumonia, some parallels
could be

drawn.

Mild cases,

defined

as those

who

were

treated

as outpatients, accounted

for

75.74% of all pregnancies with COVID-19 and 15.92% of all pregnancies with pneumonia without
other risk factors recorded. While “severe” cases (in which the clinician identified non-reassuring
signs and symptoms related or not to pregnancy) that were more likely to be admitted represented
24.26% of pregnant women with COVID-19 and 84.08% in the subset of pregnant women with
COVID-19

pneumonia. The rate of

pregnant women

with COVID-19 “critical”

cases (Those who

required ICU admission) stood at 9.63%; however, pregnant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had
a higher rate of ICU admission (18.10%) followed by an overall COVID-19 1.69% case-fatality rate
that increased by several orders of magnitude if pneumonia was also present (11.67%).

The largest case series of women of reproductive age (15-45 years) reported by the Centers of
Disease Control and Prevention

(19)

found that among the 9% of pregnant women (8207/91412),

31.5% required hospitalization, 1.5% needed ICU support and 0.2% died. This represents up to 46.4%
additional hospitalizations in comparison to the Mexican series. The difference in the percentages
could be due to the lower proportion (2.23%) of pregnancies in women of reproductive age (15-49
years) in our study, in addition to characteristics inherent to their population or their health system.

The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor on the cell surface to which binds SARSCoV-2 for entering inside it. During pregnancy, ACE2 activity can increase up to twofold, being the
placenta and the uterus the most important sources of ACE2

adequate pregnancy progression and fetal development, as its deficiency relates to both impaired
gestational weight and fetal growth restriction

(22)

.

Lower estrogen activity, a down regulator of

ACE2 expression, may contribute in its increased activity seen in pregnancy. 17β-estradiol (E2) is
physiologically found in women during pregnancy and has been shown to reduce ACE2 mRNA in
differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), which does not necessarily mean a
reduction of surface ACE2 protein

Regarding altitude, we found that in pregnant women altitude influenced the trend of COVID-19,
development of pneumonia, admission, intubation, and maternal case-fatality rates (

women but tended to decay with higher altitudes (

Figure 3

). Finally, the last difference was seen at

case-fatality rates, finding that pregnant women are at lower CFR above 750 meters (

Figure 4 – E

).

This paper confirms that predictive models could be used to monitor populations at risk through
probability plots

(25)

. This approach has the advantage of performing a regression on the continuous

spectrum of altitudes instead of assigning a static value for altitude ranges, which could introduce
cluster effect and difficult the interpretation of results.

Limitations

of

the

study

included

that

the

dataset

did

not

record

the

trimester

of

pregnancy,

therefore we couldn’t determined the clinical reason for admission to regular hospitalization or ICU
or whether the patient was admitted preventively and subsequently worsened their respiratory
parameters requiring intubation. Because of this, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
first trimester affects women and fetal stability across the course of pregnancy, despite that SARSCoV-2

transplacental

transmission

has

been

reported

previously

(47)

.

Also,

pregnant

women’s

physiology varies across gestational age and might interact with the hypobaric hypoxia seen at high
altitudes. In order to isolate

the effects of pregnancy, we only included women with no other

recorded risk factors in the analysis, so the burden of chronic diseases such as hypertension and
obesity remains to be scrutinized.

Conclusion
Pregnancy was associated with a higher probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 pneumonia
and

rates.

Furthermore,

the

However,

our

results

suggest

that

as

the

increase,

the

risk

of

infection

decreases. Despite, various aspects of this virus are yet unknown, ACE2 and EPO may play important

in

this
