Abstract

9

With surging global demand for increased SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity, clinical laboratories

10

seek automated, high-throughput molecular solutions, particularly for specimen types which do

11

not rely upon supply of specialized collection devices or viral transport media (VTM). Saliva

12

was evaluated as a diagnostic specimen for SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test

13

on the cobas® 6800 instrument. Saliva specimens submitted from various patient populations

14

under investigation for COVID-19 from March-July 2020 were processed in the laboratory with

15

sterile phosphate-buffered saline in a 1:2 dilution and vortexed with glass beads. The processed

16

saliva samples were tested using a commercial assay for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene

17

(LightMix®) in comparison to the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test. 22/64 (34.4%) of the saliva

18

samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Positive and negative concordance between the

19

LightMix® and cobas® assays were 100%. There was no cross-contamination of samples

20

observed on the cobas® 6800. The overall invalid rate for saliva on the cobas® 6800 (1/128,

21

0.78%) was similar to the baseline invalid rate observed for nasopharyngeal swabs/VTM and

22

plasma samples. Saliva is a feasible specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas®

23

6800, with potential to improve turnaround time and enhance testing capacity.

Introduction

25

The global public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for

26

diagnostic testing which is sustainable, practical, rapid and scalable(1). With an increasing

27

worldwide demand for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing, supply-chain issues for high-quality,

28

flocked nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs have created significant challenges for testing capacity in

29

clinical and public health laboratories. Alternate specimen types, such as saliva, have been

30

reported in some studies to have nearly comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs for the

31

detection of SARS-CoV-2, and may be an appropriate supplemental or alternate diagnostic

32

specimen(2–4). Although a variety of methods for saliva collection have been described(2, 5, 6),

33

we have previously shown the utility of testing saliva in the absence of transport media, which

34

enables a simple collection technique that avoids the introduction of potential inhibitors(7, 8) and

35

dependence on supply of specialized saliva collection devices.

36

In addition to potentially obviating supply shortages, saliva has been increasingly described as a

37

useful sample for the diagnosis of COVID-19 to overcome certain pre-analytical collection

38

challenges. Flocked NP swabs have been the preferred specimen type due to established

39

sensitivity, but may occasionally result in false-negative test results due to poor specimen

40

collection quality(9) or timing of testing relative to symptom onset(10–12). Lower respiratory

41

tract specimens such as a bronchoalveolar lavage are often obtained from severely ill patients,

42

but require aerosol-generating medical procedures and thus have the potential for aerosolization

43

and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, only a minority of patients with COVID-19 are

44

able to produce expectorated sputum(13). Saliva is a convenient alternate sample to collect for

45

SARS-CoV-2 detection, particularly for patients with high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 but

46

repeatedly negative test results by NP swabs(14, 15) or for individuals unwilling or unable to

47

tolerate NP swab collection.

48

Within our clinical laboratory, processing and testing of saliva is currently a manual process

49

requiring extraction (MagNA Pure Compact or MagNA Pure 96, Roche Molecular Diagnostics,

50

Pleasanton, CA) followed by amplification (LightCycler 480, Roche). Post-analytical reporting

51

into the electronic medical records system is also a manual process. As a result, capacity for

52

saliva testing in our laboratory is limited, with delays in turnaround time compared to

53

nasopharyngeal swabs which are processed entirely on the automated cobas® 6800 (Roche). We

54

sought to evaluate the potential utilization of the cobas® 6800 for SARS-CoV-2 detection from

55

saliva.

56
57

Materials and Methods

58

From March-July 2020, saliva was ordered by clinicians from both hospitalized and ambulatory

59

patients for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Briefly, >1mL of saliva was collected in a sterile

60

screw-top container (Starplex Scientific Inc., Etobicoke, Canada) without the addition of

61

transport media, and then processed in the virology laboratory with phosphate-buffered saline

62

(PBS) in a 1:2 dilution and glass beads. Samples were tested using the LightMix® ModularDx

63

SARS-CoV (COVID19) E-gene assay (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany), with use of the MagNA

64

Pure Compact or MagNA Pure 96 and LightCycler 480. The remaining volume of processed

65

saliva samples was stored at –70°C. Processed saliva samples were then tested with the cobas®

66

SARS-CoV-2 Test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Laval, QC) on the cobas® 6800. Prior to

67

cobas® SARS-CoV-2 testing, a software upgrade (Assay Specific Analysis Package [ASAP])

68

was required on the cobas® 6800 to prevent viscous specimens from mistakenly being

69

interpreted as clotted/invalid by the instrument. Samples known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2

70

based on results from the LightMix® assay were alternated with negative samples in a

71

checkerboard pattern on the 96-well processing plate, and tested in duplicate.

72
73

Results

74

A total of 64 clinical saliva samples were included and tested in duplicate for SARS-CoV-2 on

75

the cobas® 6800. Twenty-two (34.4%) of the samples were known to be positive for SARS-

76

CoV-2 based on prior results from the LightMix® assay, and 42 (65.6%) had no detectable

77

SARS-CoV-2. Compared to the LightMix® assay, positive percent agreement and negative

78

percent agreement on the cobas® 6800 were 100%. The median cycle threshold (Ct) values for

79

detection of the Envelope (E) gene were comparable between the cobas® 6800 (28.82,

80

interquartile range [IQR] 7.29) and the LightMix® assay (26.63, IQR 7.61) (Figure 1). No

81

carryover or cross-contamination of samples was observed, even with strongly positive samples

82

(Ct values 13 to 24) directly adjacent to negative samples. One saliva sample produced an error

83

which was reported by the cobas 6800® instrument as ‘Invalid’; this sample was successfully

84

tested on the duplicate run. In total, the observed error rate for saliva samples tested on the

85

cobas® 6800 was 0.78% (1/128).

86
87

Discussion

88

In our evaluation of the cobas® 6800 for saliva testing, we demonstrated complete concordance

89

in comparison to the LightMix® assay, which is the current assay utilized in our laboratory for

90

clinical testing of specimens other than NP swabs such as saliva.

91

Previous studies have evaluated the feasibility of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 detection on

92

commercial instruments such as the Cepheid GeneXpert® System(16) and cobas® 8800(12).

93

However, there are technical challenges associated with processing saliva for automated, high-

94

throughput testing. As a highly viscous sample compared to viral transport media, there is

95

potential for pipetting errors or instrument contamination. In our laboratory, saliva is pre-

96

processed with sterile PBS and glass beads in order to decrease the viscosity of the sample. The

97

samples utilized in the study were from a variety of clinical situations, including long-term care

98

residents, inpatients at a tertiary care hospital, and outpatient contacts of known COVID-19

99

patients; these samples would be broadly representative of saliva ordered and collected for

100

clinical testing in the future. Reassuringly, testing with this specimen type did not result in a

101

significant number of invalid results (1/128, 0.78%), and was comparable to the rate of invalid

102

results observed in our laboratory from nasopharyngeal swabs with the SARS-CoV-2 Test

103

(0.20%) and plasma used with other cobas® 6800 assays (0.30%) (unpublished data). We also

104

assessed the potential for carryover during pipetting on the cobas® by testing positive samples

105

alternated with negative samples in a checkerboard pattern, and did not identify any cross-

106

contamination of samples.

107

This study is limited by the retrospective testing of stored saliva samples. Clinical testing was

108

performed in real time on the LightMix® assay, and samples were stored for subsequent testing

109

on the cobas® after the software had been upgraded. Although testing was not performed in

110

parallel, there was high concordance of testing despite sample storage. Furthermore, testing of

111

retrospective samples was necessary to ensure a sufficient number of saliva samples with

112

detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA were included.

113

Due to limited remnant sample volume in some cases, five of the twenty-two saliva samples

114

positive for SARS-CoV-2 (22.7%) underwent additional dilution with sterile PBS in order to test

115

on the cobas® 6800. The Ct values in these cases cannot be directly compared to those from the

116

LightMix® assay as a measure of assay performance; however, the dilution factor in these cases

117

(1:3 to 1:5) would have had a negligible effect on the Ct values, and the aim of this study was to

118

assess the technical feasibility of saliva samples for automated, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2

119

testing on the cobas® 6800.

120

Transitioning to an automated platform for saliva testing is critical for enhancing SARS-CoV-2

121

testing capacity, particularly in preparation for a potential resurgence of COVID-19 cases or

122

mass testing of defined populations. Automated testing reduces errors in the pre-analytical and

123

post-analytical phases, and improves turnaround time by enabling saliva to be processed on

124

multiple runs per day (including overnight testing). Our evaluation confirmed the feasibility of

125

saliva as a suitable specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 testing on the cobas® 6800 platform.
