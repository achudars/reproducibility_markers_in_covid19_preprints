Objective: To optimize clinical laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspect cases
by Likelihood Ratio of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody. Methods: By
reinterpreting the data in the article "Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of
Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirusin
Infection", the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibody in diagnosis of
COVID-19 (nucleic acid positive patients) was calculated, and the posterior
probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection to diagnose was
finally calculated. Results: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG
antibody were 18.50 and 12.65 respectively, and the posterior probabilities were
90.18% and 86.26% respectively. However, the posterior probability of the two
antibodies tandem detection is 99.15%, which can give clinicians quantitative
confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected cases. According to the
results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid
detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose
COVID-19 is found. Conclusion: For suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests
should be firstly done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive,
COVID-19 can be confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is
performed, and in extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is
performed.

Since the epidemic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) from last December in China, more than one million cases had been
confirmed in more than 150 countries including China. As the country with the most
severe epidemic, China has accumulated a lot of experience in the diagnosis and
treatment of COVID-19[1-2]. Based on increased awareness of the disease, 7th version
of the new treatment plan for COVID-19 have been released by Chinese government.
In the latest version[3], which is “Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel
Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)”, the standard indicators used for confirmed
diagnosis of suspected cases including nucleic acid detection, gene sequencing and
antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, antibody detection was first written
into the diagnostic criteria. On April 2nd, FDA also approved the first SARS-CoV-2
antibody test kit for COVID-19 detection. How to use nucleic acid detection and
antibody detection to diagnose suspected COVID-19 patients more efficiently is a
question worth pondering. So this study intends to use likelihood ratio to optimize the
clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose suspected cases by nucleic acid and
antibody detection.

confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted to the people's hospital Affliated to Wuhan
University.
2. Case Definitions
2.1 Suspect cases: Considering both the following epidemiological history and
clinical manifestations.
(1)Epidemiological history: History of travel to or residence in Wuhan and its
surrounding areas, or in other communities where cases have been reported within 14
days prior to the onset of the disease; In contact with novel coronavirus infected
people (with positive results for the nucleic acid test) within 14 days prior to the onset
of the disease;In contact with patients who have fever or respiratory symptoms from
Wuhan and its surrounding area, or from communities where confirmed cases have
been reported within 14 days before the onset of the disease; Clustered cases (2 or
more cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small area such families,
offices, schools etc within 2 weeks).
(2)Clinical manifestations: Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; The aforementioned
imaging characteristics of COVID-19; Normal or decreased WBC count, normal or
decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of onset. A suspect case has any of the
epidemiological history plus any two clinical manifestations or all three clinical
manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history.
2.2 Confirmed cases: Suspect cases with one of the following etiological or
serological evidences: (1)Real-time fluorescent (RT-PCR) indicates positive for
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid; (2)Viral gene sequence is highly homologous to known
SARS-CoV-2. (3)SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG are detectable in serum;
SARS-CoV-2 virus specific IgG is detectable or reaches a titration of at least 4-fold
increase during convalescence compared with the acute phase.
3. Data and Test
The positive Likelihood Ratio (LR+) of IgM and IgG in suspected cases for nucleic
acid positive patients was calculated mainly by reinterpreting the data in the article
"Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel coronavirus IgM and
IgG Antibody in novel coronavirus Infection", According to the relevant data in

"novel coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection and Analysis of Combined Infection
Results of 8274 Subjects in Wuhan Area", the posterior probability of IgM and IgG
antibody detection alone and in series for diagnosis of nucleic acid positive patients
was calculated. The SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG are tested by chemiluminescence
immune assay(CLIA), the nucleic acid also are tested by RT-PCR.

Results
1. Diagnostic performance of IgG and IgM in diagnosing COVID-19
According to the article "Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019
novel coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirus Infection", 186
patients with positive nucleic acid detection were mentioned, and 98 patients with
negative nucleic acid detection. Combined with the number of IgG and IgM antibody
detection cases mentioned in the article, Table 1-2 was obtained.
From Table 1, it can be calculated that the sensitivity, specificity, negative
predictive value and positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody detection
to diagnose COVID-19 are 96.10%, 92.40%, 90.10% and 96.09%, respectively. The
negative likelihood ratio is 0.04 and the positive likelihood ratio is 12.65. The
accuracy is 95.07%.
From Table 2, it can be calculated that the sensitivity, specificity, negative
predictive value and positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody
detection to diagnose COVID-19 are 70.24%, 96.20%, 56.72% and 97.76%,
respectively. The negative likelihood ratio is 0.31 and the positive likelihood ratio is
18.50. The accuracy is 77.46%.
2. Posterior Probability of Single IgG, IgM and IgM/IgG tandem diagnostic test
The posterior probability formula of single index:
Prior ratio = prior probability/(1–prior probability)
Posterior ratio = Prior ratio ×LR+
Posterior probability = posterior ratio /(1+ posterior ratio)
The posterior probability formula of tandem diagnostic test of multiple indexes:

Prior ratio = prior probability/(1–prior probability)
Posterior ratio = Prior ratio ×LR+ 1×LR+2×···×LR+n
Posterior probability = posterior ratio /(1+ posterior ratio)
According to the 8274 suspected cases of COVID-19 explicitly mentioned in
"Analysis of novel coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection and Co-infection Results of
8274 Subjects in Wuhan Area", the proportion of confirmed cases from suspected
cases is 33.17%, which is the prior probability. The posterior probability of single test
of IgG, IgM and IgM/IgG tandem diagnostic test were on Table 3.
For suspected cases, after single detection of IgG and IgM antibodies, the
clinician's confidence in the diagnosis of suspected patients as COVID-19 confirmed
cases is between 86.26% and 90.18%, but after IgM/IgG tandem test, the clinician's
confidence in the diagnosis of suspected patients as COVID-19 confirmed cases has
increased to 99.15%.
3. Clinical Pathway for Clinicians to Diagnose COVID-19 Based on IgM/IgG
Antibody Tandem Test
According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages
of nucleic acid detection and antibody detection, the clinical pathway for clinicians to
diagnose COVID-19 is shown in Figure 1. It proposed a clinical path for diagnostic
COVID-19, starting with IgM/IgG tandem test, and with subsequent use, if needed, of
nucleic acid test and then high-throughput sequencing.

Discussion
With the continuous development of clinical laboratory's detection level of
antibody from human body after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the "Diagnosis and
Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)", serological
antibody detection is given the same status as nucleic acid detection for the first time
when the diagnosis of COVID-19. Meanwhile, National Medical Products
Administration of China has also approved 8 antibody detection kits in an emergency,
laying the foundation for antibody detection to enter clinical practice.

Nucleic acid detection and antibody detection have their own advantages and
disadvantages [6-7]. First of all, from the aspect of specimen sampling, commonly used
specimens for nucleic acid detection are sputum, nasopharynx swab or various lung
lavage fluids. Sampling has great infection risks for medical personnel and also has
potential infection risks for laboratory personnel for nucleic acid detection[8].
However, the type of antibody test specimen is blood, which is relatively easy to
obtain and the infection risk of medical personnel is relatively low. Secondly,
according to the quality of detection results, nucleic acid detection is restricted by the
quality of sample materials and the extraction quality of nucleic acid, and there is a
serious undetected phenomenon. Different sample types have different detection rates,
Sucha as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates
(93%), sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy ( 46%),
pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%), and blood (1%)[9]. So continuous nucleic acid
detection for several times for some suspected patients is very necessary and can
effectively avoid false negative result. For antibody detection, except for some
immunocompromised patients, which cannot produce antibodies effectively,
antibodies should be present in most infected persons[10]. Antibody detection is mainly
limited by the sensitivity and related performance of the kit. In addition, there will be
some false positives caused by detection interference in tumor patients, patients with
autoimmune diseases and other patients with chronic infection. Finally, the
convenience of detection operation, antibody detection has advantages that nucleic
acid detection does not have at all, including simplicity and convenience of operation,
qualification of personnel, requirements of detection environment, etc. Therefore, it
has great clinical value to study how to optimize antibody detection and nucleic acid
detection in clinical diagnosis.
Through searching the relevant articles, no clear research about the optimization
path of antibody and nucleic acid detection is found. Therefore, this research uses the
published data and adopts the method of positive likelihood ratio to calculate the
posterior probability to propose the possibility of optimizing the diagnosis path for the
first time.Since the original result data of the two antibodies tandem test cannot be

obtained from "Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum 2019 novel
coronavirus IgM and IgG Antibodies in novel coronavirus Infection", the diagnostic
performance index of tandem test cannot be analyzed in this paper. However, this
study solves the problem by calculating the posterior probability through the LR+,
and proves that the posterior probability of the two antibodies tandem test is much
higher than each single antibody detection, while the posterior probability of single
antibody detection is not much different. This shows that the single antibody test does
not significantly increase the confidence of clinicians in the clear diagnosis of
confirmed cases from suspected cases. However, the two antibodies tandem test
obviously improved this confidence, making the clinician's confidence in diagnosis
increased to 99.15%,which is helpful for clinicians to optimize the diagnosis process
by quantification method. By the study, the clinical pathway for clinicians to diagnose
COVID-19 was that, for suspected cases, IgM and IgG antibody tests should be firstly
done at the same time. If the antibody tests are all positive, COVID-19 can be
confirmed. If not, nucleic acid detection (one or more times) is performed, and in
extreme cases, high-throughput viral genome sequencing is performed[11].
In short, using positive likelihood ratio to calculate the posterior probability could
better reflect the tandem detection of the two antibodies compared with conventional
diagnostic performance indicators. In practical work, it is more helpful for clinicians
to optimize the diagnosis process. In addition, this study is aimed at the secondary
excavation of published literature data. In the future, the original data should be used
and the sample size expanded to further verify the conclusion.
