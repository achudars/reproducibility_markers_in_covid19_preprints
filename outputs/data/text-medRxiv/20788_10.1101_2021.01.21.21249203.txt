The coronaviral spike is the dominant viral antigen and the target of neutralizing
antibodies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the
tetrapyrrole products of haem metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography we mapped the tetrapyrrole
interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At
physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of
SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing
antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on
the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the
NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft
vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that the virus co-opts the haem
metabolite for the evasion of humoral immunity via allosteric shielding of a sensitive
epitope and demonstrate the remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD.

Trimeric coronaviral spike glycoproteins form prominent features on viral particles that are
responsible for the attachment to a receptor on the host cell and, ultimately, fusion of the
viral and cellular membranes (1, 2). Encoded by a single viral gene, the mature spike
glycoprotein comprises two subunits, S1 and S2, which mediate binding to the receptor and
facilitate fusion, respectively. The recognition of the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 host
receptor, the cellular membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, maps to the S1
C-terminal domain (referred to as the receptor binding domain, RBD) (3-5), while the
function of the N-terminal domain (NTD) remains enigmatic. Both domains can be targeted
by potent neutralizing antibodies that arise in infected individuals. The majority of
characterized neutralizing antibodies bind the RBD, while minimal structural information

exists about neutralizing epitopes on the NTD (6-10). The immune properties of the spike
glycoprotein underpin ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts (11).
In the course of our activities to support the development of serology for SARSCoV-2, we produced a range of recombinant coronaviral spike antigens by expression in
human cell lines (Fig. S1A). Surprisingly, preparations of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike and
S1 carried a distinctive green hue, with prominent peaks at ~390 and 670 nm in their light
absorbance spectra (Fig. S1A-B). These unusual features were also evident in the spectrum
of S1 from the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 isolate, but not those from the seasonal human
coronaviruses NL63 and OC43 (Fig. S1B-C). The property was confined within the spike
NTD and absent in isolated RBD (Fig. S1B). The spectra of the SARS-CoV spike constructs
were consistent with biliverdin (Fig. S1B), a product of haem metabolism responsible for
the coloration of bruises and green jaundice. We isolated the pigment from denatured
SARS-CoV-2 S1 and confirmed the presence of biliverdin IX by mass spectrometry (Fig.
S2). Biliverdin is produced at the first step of haem detoxification by oxygenases and is then
reduced to bilirubin, the final product of tetrapyrrole catabolism in humans (12). We
measured tetrapyrrole binding to immobilised SARS-CoV-2 S1 using surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) and estimated the dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction with
biliverdin and bilirubin at 9.8 ±1.3 nM and 720 ±250 nM, respectively (Fig. S3A-B, Table
S1). SARS-CoV-1 S1 likewise displayed nanomolar affinity for biliverdin (Fig. S3I, Table
S1). The spike bound haem considerably more weakly, with Kd of 7.0 ±1.2 M, while no
interaction was observed with protoporphyrin IX (Fig. S3C-D, Table S1).
Next, we imaged single particles of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (3,
13) in the presence of excess biliverdin using cryo-electron microscopy. Image processing
resulted in the 3D reconstruction of closed (3RBDs-down) and partially open (1RBD-up

conformation) states of the spike at 3.35 and 3.50 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 1A, Fig.
S4, Table S2). Close inspection of the cryo-EM maps revealed features interpretable as a
biliverdin molecule buried within a deep cleft on one side of each of the NTD domains (Fig.
1A, Fig. S5A). To define the structural basis for the interaction more precisely, we cocrystallised the isolated NTD with biliverdin and determined the structure at 1.8 Å
resolution (Fig. 1B, Fig. S5B, Table S3). The metabolite fits snugly into the cleft with the
pyrrole rings B and C buried inside and propionate groups appended to rings A and D
projecting toward the outside. The pocket is lined by hydrophobic residues (Ile101, Trp104,
Ile119, Val126, Met177, Phe192, Phe194, Ile203, and Leu226), which form van der Waals
interactions with the ligand. Biliverdin packs against His207, which projects its N2 atom
towards pyrrolic amines, approaching three of them at ~3.6 Å. Pyrroles A and B are
involved in a - stacking with side chain of Arg190, which is stabilised by hydrogen
bonding with Asn99. The binding of biliverdin largely buries the side chain of Asn121,
which makes a hydrogen bond with the lactam group of pyrrole D. In agreement with the
extensive interactions observed in the crystal structure, the melting point of isolated NTD
increased by over 8°C in the presence of biliverdin (Fig. S3K). Unidentified entities at the
tetrapyrrole binding site were observed in published SARS-CoV-2 spike reconstructions (1,
4, 13-17), presumably obtained with partial occupancy by the metabolite; in some cryoEM maps, the bound biliverdin molecule is resolved remarkably well (Fig. S6) (14-17).
The presence of a histidine residue in the biliverdin binding pocket (Fig. 1B)
suggested that the interaction may be pH-dependent. In agreement with this hypothesis, the
Kd of the S1-biliverdin interaction increased to 250 ±100 M at pH 5.0 (Fig. S3E,H and
Table S1), and purification under acidic conditions greatly reduced the biliverdin content of
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Fig. S1D). Substitutions of spike residues closely involved

in ligand binding (H207A, R190K and N121Q) diminished pigmentation of purified
recombinant protein (Fig. S1E). The biliverdin binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S1 was
reduced by two and three orders of magnitude by the R190K and N121Q amino acid
substitutions, respectively (Fig. S3F-H, Table S1). The latter ablated the interaction with
bilirubin, confirming that the tetrapyrroles share the binding site on the spike (Fig. S3H).
SARS-CoV-2 spikes carrying these mutations supported infection of Vero and Huh7 cells
by a pseudotyped retroviral vector, indicating that biliverdin binding is not required for viral
entry under tissue culture conditions (Fig. S7).
Because biliverdin binding conceals a deep hydrophobic cleft on the NTD (Fig. 1B),
we suspected that it may mask or modify the antigenic properties of the viral spike. To test
this hypothesis, we measured the reactivity of sera from 17 SARS-CoV-2-infected and
convalescent individuals with full-length WT and N121Q SARS-CoV-2 spike using a flow
cytometry-based assay (18). Remarkably, addition of 10 M biliverdin reduced binding of
patient IgGs to WT spike, supressing the reactivity of some of the immune sera by as much
as 50% (Fig. 2). By contrast, antibody binding to N121Q SARS-CoV-2 spike was not
affected by addition of biliverdin (Fig. 2). Binding of IgM and IgA antibodies, which are
present at lower titres in these patients (18), was more variably affected (Fig. S8B-D). In a
separate experiment, we tested 91 clinical serum samples in an IgG capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected using WT
or N121Q S1 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Biliverdin-depleted WT S1 was
significantly more reactive than the same protein supplemented with excess metabolite (Fig.
S9). By contrast, addition of biliverdin did not dampen detection of the SARS-CoV-2
antibodies with N121Q S1 (Fig. S9).
It is remarkable that a small molecule with a footprint of 370 Å2, corresponding to
only ~0.9% of solvent-exposed surface (per spike monomer, Fig. 1A), competes with a

considerable fraction of the spike-specific serum antibody population (Fig. 2). These results
prompted us to evaluate a panel of human antibodies cloned from B cells of SARS-CoV-2
convalescent individuals. We used 38 IgGs reported in a recent study (10), as well as a panel
of 15 novel SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgGs obtained from individuals with asymptomatic
infection, or mild/severe disease undergoing characterization in one of our laboratories
(Graham et al., in preparation). We tested these monoclonal antibodies for binding to
recombinant WT and N121Q S1 by ELISA. Remarkably, 9 of 53 (17%) IgGs lost binding
to WT, but not to N121Q S1, in the presence of 10 M biliverdin (Fig. 3A,C, Fig. S10A).
Furthermore, addition of biliverdin strongly suppressed binding of these antibodies to fulllength WT but not N121Q SARS-CoV-2 spike expressed on the surface of transfected
HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B,D). By contrast, reactivity of both RBD-specific controls
(COVA1-18 and COVA1-12), was not affected by the metabolite (Fig. 3A-D).
Two of the biliverdin-sensitive monoclonal IgGs, COVA1-22, COVA2-17, were
previously reported to efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped retrovirus (10).
Addition of biliverdin suppressed neutralization of the pseudotype carrying WT but not
N121Q spike (Fig. 3E). The mutation had a differential effect on neutralization showing a
decrease in potency for COVA1-22 and no effect for P008_056 or COVA2-17. As expected,
addition of biliverdin had no effect on neutralization by COVA1-18. Neutralization of
replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 by P008_056, COVA1-22 or COVA2-17 was
substantially decreased by addition of biliverdin (Fig. 3F). Intriguingly, while P008_056
seemed somewhat less potent in the pseudotype assay (Fig. 3E), it efficiently neutralized
live SARS-CoV-2 virus, achieving 50% and >90% inhibition at concentrations of 0.03 and
1.56 g/ml, respectively, in a biliverdin-sensitive manner (Fig. 3F, Fig. S10B).

To establish the structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by a biliverdinsensitive antibody, we imaged single particles of the viral spike in complex with P008_056
antigen binding fragment (Fab). Cryo-EM image processing resulted in reconstruction of
structures with one, two and three Fab moieties bound per trimeric viral glycoprotein (Fig.
S10A-B), and the best map was obtained for the complex containing a single Fab (Fig. 4A,
Fig. S11C-D). The reconstruction with a local resolution of ~4 Å at the NTD-Fab interface
allowed for unambiguous tracing of the protein backbone and revealed positions of key
amino acid side chains (Fig. 4A, Fig. S5C). P008_056 binds the spike at the side of the NTD
-sandwich fold, which undergoes profound conformational rearrangements (Movie S1).
Access to the epitope is gated by a solvent-exposed loop composed of predominantly
hydrophilic residues (“gate”, SARS-CoV-2 spike residues 174-188; Fig. 1). To allow
P008_056 binding, the loop swings out of the way, with a backbone displacement in the
middle of the loop of ~15 Å (Fig. 4B). The gating mechanism is accompanied by insertion
of Phe175 and Met177, which are located in the beginning of the loop, into the hydrophobic
pocket vacated by biliverdin (Fig. 4B, Fig. S5C). Thus, when bound, the metabolite appears
to act as a wedge that restricts gate opening. Antibody binding is additionally complemented
by an upward movement of a -hairpin (“lip”, SARS-CoV-2 residues 143-155), which
overlays a cluster of aromatic residues (Fig. 1, Fig. 4B). The marked gain in thermal stability
upon biliverdin binding (Fig. S3K) is consistent with resistance to an antibody that requires
major conformational remodeling of the NTD for binding (Movie S1).
It is well-established that viruses employ extensive glycosylation of their envelopes
to shield antibody epitopes from recognition by humoral immunity (19-21). Here, we
identified and structurally characterised a novel class of a neutralizing epitope, present on
SARS-CoV-2 spike, which is differentially exposed through recruitment of a metabolite. In

contrast to glycosylation, co-opting a metabolite may allow conditional unmasking, for
example under acidic conditions within the endosomal compartment. Biliverdin levels in
plasma of healthy individuals (0.9-6.9 M) and more so under pathological conditions (>50
M) (22) greatly exceed the Kd of its interaction with the spike (~10 nM) and are therefore
sufficient to affect SARS-CoV-2 antigenic properties and neutralization. Although SARSCoV-2 spike bound bilirubin with lower affinity (Fig. S3), this final product of haem
catabolism accumulates at higher levels in vivo (22). Moreover, elevated bilirubin levels
correlate with the symptoms and mortality among COVID-19 patients (23-26). Therefore,
the tetrapyrroles likely share a role in SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion. Severe COVID-19
symptoms and death are associated with neutrophil infiltration in pulmonary capillaries and
alveolar space (27). Indeed, nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients are enriched in
neutrophil myeloperoxidase (28), a highly abundant haem-containing protein responsible
for coloration of mucus (29). Alongside extensive vascular damage, these symptoms
provide rich source of haem catabolites, which may contribute to the inability to control the
infection in severe cases. Mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD are associated with
viral escape from antibody immunity (30, 31) and have been observed in circulating viral
strains (32, 33). Our results demonstrate a remarkable structural plasticity of the NTD and
highlight the importance of this domain for antibody immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

(METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGD) was used to direct secretion of the RBD construct.
The vector for production of the His6-tagged stabilised trimeric SARS-CoV-2 has been
described (13). Expression constructs encoding heavy and light chains of P008_056 Fab
were made by inserting the respective coding sequences into pHLsec (35), including a
sequence encoding a hexa-histidine (His6) tag on the heavy chain fragment C-terminus.
With exception of trimeric stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain, the proteins
were produced by transient transfection of Expi293 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cells with
endotoxin-free preparations of the corresponding DNA constructs using ExpiFectamine293
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were maintained in shake flasks in FreeStyle293
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) medium at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To produce
SARS-CoV-2 S1 NTD fragment for crystallography, cell culture medium was
supplemented with 5 M kifunensine (Sigma-Aldrich) to suppress complex glycosylation
(36, 37). Conditioned medium containing recombinant product was harvested twice, 4 and
8 days post-transfection, or once, for production of the NTD and P008_056 Fab, 5 days
post-transfection. For production of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain, Expi293
transfected with the pcDNA3-based expression construct (13) were selected with 250 g/ml
geneticin. Stably transfected cells, grown to a density of 3.5 million per ml at 37oC, were
shifted to 32oC for 3 days prior to harvesting conditioned medium to enhance secretion of
the viral glycoprotein (38).
TwinStrep-tagged proteins were captured on Strep-Tactin XT (IBA LifeSciences)

saline. For the use in crystallography, SARS-CoV-2 S1 NTD was digested with Endo Hf
(New England Biolabs) and rhinoviral 3C protease to trim glycans and to remove the Cterminal twin Strep tag; Endo Hf was depleted by absorption to amylose resin (New England
Biolabs). The proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography through a
Superdex 200 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) in HBSE (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20
mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0) and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Vivaspin-20 with 10kDa cut-off (Sartorius). To deplete biliverdin from SARS-CoV-2 S1, recombinant protein
eluted from Strep-Tactin XT resin was supplemented with 0.5 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2
and subjected to size exclusion chromatography through a Superdex 200 16/600 column in
200 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2; fractions containing S1 were pooled and dialyzed
overnight against HBSE buffer. Light absorbance spectra of recombinant proteins were
acquired using Jasco V-550 UV/VIS spectrophotometer.

Identification of biliverdin by mass spectrometry
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1 (3.5 mg/ml, 500 l), denatured by addition of 1% (w/v)
sodium dodecyl sulfate, was extracted with 500 l n-butanol. Organic phase containing
green pigment was allowed to evaporate under vacuum, and dry residue was re-dissolved in
20 l water. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed as described
previously (39). LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted using a Dionex UltiMate LC system
(Thermo Scientific) with a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle, Merck

grade, Sigma-Aldrich) was used, followed by a 5-min wash of 95:5 Solvent A to Solvent B
and 5-min re-equilibration. Other parameters were as follows: flow rate, 300 μl/min; column

temperature, 25°C; injection volume, 10 μl; autosampler temperature, 4°C. Metabolites
were detected across a mass range of 70-1050 m/z using a Q Exactive Orbitrap instrument
(Thermo Scientific) with heated electrospray ionization and polarity switching mode at a
resolution of 70,000 (at 200 m/z). MS parameters were as follows: spray voltage 3.5 kV for
positive mode and 3.2 kV for negative mode; probe temperature, 320°C; sheath gas, 30
arbitrary units; auxiliary gas, 5 arbitrary units. Parallel reaction monitoring was used at a
resolution of 17,500 to confirm the identification of biliverdin; collision energy was set at
30 in high-energy collisional dissociation mode. Data was recorded using Xcalibur 3.0.63
software and analysed using Free Style 1.6 and Tracefinder 4.1 software (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s workflows.

SPR
Experiments were performed on a Biacore S200 (Cytiva); S1 protein, diluted to 50 g/ml
in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Cytiva product
code BR100530) using amine coupling chemistry. Immobilization levels were typically
4,000 response units. Analyte binding was studied in running buffer comprising 150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0 or 50 mM BisTris-HCl, pH 5.0, 0.05% Tween-20,
and 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Biliverdin, bilirubin, haem, and protoporphyrin were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (product codes 3089, 14370, 51280, and P8293, respectively).
Generally, analyte stock solutions were prepared in DMSO prior to dilution in running
buffer, maintaining the final DMSO concentration of 1%. The final analyte concentration
was verified by spectrophotometry, using the following molar extinction coefficients:
biliverdin 39,900 (at a wavelength of 388 nm), bilirubin 53,846 (460 nm), haem 58,440 (385
nm), and protoporphyrin IX 107,000 (407 nm). Alternatively, biliverdin, which is highly
soluble at pH>7, was dissolved directly in running buffer, allowing to omit DMSO from the

experiment. The presence of DMSO did not affect the measured Kd of the S1-biliverdin
interaction (Table S1). All experiments were conducted using a CM5-kinetics-multicycle
template at 25°C. Flow rate was 30 l/min with a contact time of 180 s, followed by a
dissociation time of 10 min; three start-ups were performed at the beginning of each
experiment. Solvent correction was deemed unnecessary for the assays that contained
DMSO. Biliverdin displayed very fast association precluding detailed kinetics analyses due
to mass transfer effects. Data were analysed using the 1:1 binding model in the Biacore
S200 Evaluation software to estimate equilibrium binding constants (Kd).

Protein thermostability assay
Biliverdin-depleted SARS-CoV-2 NTD (corresponding to spike residues 1-310) was diluted
to 1 mg/ml in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0 and supplemented with
biliverdin from a 5-mM stock prepared in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0 where appropriate.
Melting curves were recorded using 20−95 °C 1.5 °C/min temperature ramps on a
Promethius NT.48 instrument (Nanotemper). Melting points were determined from
inflection points of fluorescence intensity ratios (350 and 330 nm) using first derivative
analysis (fig. S3K).

Cryo-electron microscopy
Four l stabilised trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (0.6 mg/ml final concentration
in TBSE supplemented with 0.1% n-octylglucoside) with 25 M biliverdin or 0.2 mg/ml
P008_056 Fab, was applied onto glow-discharged 200-mesh copper holey carbon R2/2
grids (Quantifoil) for 1 min, under 100% humidity at 20°C, before blotting for 3-4 sec and
plunge-freezing in liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

data were collected on Titan Krios microscopes operating at 300 keV (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Single particles of spike-biliverdin were imaged using a Falcon III direct
electron detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 15,962 movies were recorded with
a calibrated pixel size of 1.09 Å and a total electron exposure of 33 e-/Å2, spread over 30
frames in single electron counting mode. The spike-Fab complex was imaged on a GIF
Quantum K2 detector with a post-column energy filter (Gatan), selecting a 20-eV window,
in single electron counting mode. A total of 17,010 movies were collected with a pixel size
of 1.38 Å and total electron exposure of 51 e-/Å2 spread over 40 frames. Both datasets were
acquired with a defocus range of -1.6 to -4 m (Table S2).

Cryo-EM image processing and real-space refinement
Micrograph movies were aligned with dose weighting applied using MotionCor2 (40), and
the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated from the frame sums with
Gctf (41). Images exhibiting ice contamination or poor CTF estimation were discarded at
this stage, leaving 15,803 (biliverdin complex) and 16,619 (Fab complex) movies for further
processing. An initial set of particles, autopicked with Laplacian-of-Gaussian function in
Relion-3.1 (42), was used to generate 2D class averages that served as templates for picking
both datasets with Gautomatch (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/). Particles
(1,209,334 and 2,505,265 for spike-biliverdin and spike-Fab, respectively) were extracted
from weighted frame sums, binned 4-fold, and subjected to reference-free 2D classification
in cryoSPARC-2 (43). 371,422 spike-biliverdin and 709,127 spike-Fab particles belonging
to well-defined classes containing trimeric spike were selected for further processing (figs
S4A, S11A). An initial 3D model was generated using ab initio procedure in cryoSPARC2. Selected particles, re-extracted with 2-fold binning, were subjected to 3D classification
into 11 (spike-biliverdin) and 16 (spike-Fab) classes in Relion-3.1. Particles belonging to

selected 3D classes were re-extracted without binning and used in 3D reconstruction
followed by CTF refinement (beam tilt and per-particle defocus) and Bayesian polishing in
Relion-3.1. The final 3D reconstructions were done using non-uniform refinement
procedure in cryoSPARC-2. Resolution is reported according to the gold-standard Fourier
shell correlation (FSC), using the 0.143 criterion (44, 45) (figs S4C-D and S11C-D, Table
S2). To aid in model building process, the maps were filtered and sharpened using
deepEMhancer (46) or using density modification procedure in Phenix (47). An additional
spike-Fab reconstruction was obtained using multibody refinement in Relion-3.1
accounting for two rigid bodies (one spanning the Fab moiety plus the associated NTD, and
the second encompassing the rest of the structure) was used for illustration purposes (Fig.
4A).
For the 3RBD-down spike model, coordinates from protein databank entry 6ZGE
(13) were docked into the cryo-EM map in Chimera (48). Residues 14-319 were replaced
with the NTD crystal structure for each of the chains along with the associated biliverdin
molecules. The model was manually adjusted in Coot (49) and refined using
phenix.real_space_refine (version 1.19rc5-4047)(50). The model was then docked into the
cryo-EM map of asymmetric 1RBD-up reconstruction and one RBD refitted to the extended
position in Chimera; the model was manually adjusted in Coot and refined using
phenix.real_space_refine. For the spike-Fab model, 3RBD-down spike model was fitted to
the map using Chimera; the RBD of chain A was fitted in to the extended position, which
is less well defined, and the NTD of chain C was extensively remodelled. The protein data
bank was searched for similar structures using the sequence of the Fab chains; 6APC (51)
and 6PHB (52) were selected as templates for the heavy and light chains of the Fab
respectively, variable and constant sub-domains were fitted individually using either
phenix.dock_in_map (53) and/or fitted in Chimera. The Fab fragments were manually

adjusted to match the sequence of P0008_056 antibody and fitted to the cryo-EM map. The
constant domains of the Fab are less well resolved in the map and minimal adjustments were
made to these domains. The whole structure was subjected to automatic flexible fitting using
Namdinator v2.13 (54) and then phenix.real_space_refine before another round of manual
rebuilding in Coot and a final round of phenix.real_space_refine. Biliverdin (BLA) ligand
geometry definition file was generated by Grade (Global Phasing) and model quality was
assessed using Molprobity (55).

Crystal Structure of the NTD in complex with biliverdin
Protein construct (spanning SARS-CoV-2 S1 residues 1-310) at 10 mg/ml was
supplemented with 90 M biliverdin before mixing with crystallization mother liquor in a
1:1 ratio. Plate-like crystals grew to 80-120 m in two dimensions and ~10-20 m in the
third dimension in conditions containing 24% PEG 3350 (w/v) and 0.25 M NaSCN by
hanging drop vapour diffusion over 1-2 weeks at 18°C. Crystals were cryoprotected by the
addition of PEG 400 to a final concentration of 30% (v/v) to the drop solution before flash
freezing in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at the PX1 beamline, Swiss Light Source,
using wavelength 1 Å, 100% transmission, a 40-m beam, 0.1-sec exposure and 0.5°
rotation per image. Data were indexed, scaled and merged using XDS (56) and Aimless (57)
via Xia2 (58). SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD (residues 14-290; PDB ID 6ZGE) (13) was used as
a model for molecular replacement and yielded a solution containing one NTD per
asymmetric unit, with a log likelihood gain of 490 and translation function Z-score of 22.7,
in space group C2221 using Phaser (59) within the Phenix package (53). The initial
molecular replacement solution was subjected to morph model in Phenix before

commencing with rounds of manual fitting in Coot (49) and refinement using phenix.refine
(version 1.19rc4-4035) (53). First, the protein chain was fitted and extended where possible,
and refined, then glycosylation moieties were added where visualized in the positive Fo-Fc
density, followed by conceivable PEG and water molecules. The electron density around
the disulphide bonds suggested that they were labile and as such were modeled as alternative
conformations between oxidized and reduced where appropriate and the occupancy refined
between these states. The stability of the disulphide bonds could have been affected by trace
amounts of DTT introduced during the treatment of the protein with 3C protease and
EndoH. The Rfree and Rwork were 21.5 and 18.5%, respectively, before a biliverdin molecule
was fitted into the prominent positive difference density. The final refinement included four
Translation/Libration/Screw groups (residues 14-67, 68-202, 203-278, 279-319) that had
been segmented by the TLSMD server (60). All ligand geometry definition files were
generated by Grade (Global Phasing) and model quality was assessed using Molprobity
(61). The final model consists of spike residues 14-319, one biliverdin molecule, seven Nliked glycans (attached to asparagine residues at positions 17, 61, 122, 149, 165, 234, and
282), 10 PEG moieties, and 351 water molecules and has reasonable geometry and fit to the
electron density (Table S3, fig. S5B).

Human sera
Following written informed consent, serum samples from staff and patients of the Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) and the Wellington Hospital diagnosed with
SARS-CoV-2 infection were donated to the Communicable Diseases Research Tissue Bank
(CDRTB) of the Section of Virology, Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College
London. The use of these sera was approved by the CDRTB Steering Committee in
accordance with the responsibility delegated by the National Research Ethics Service (South

Central Ethics Committee Oxford – C, NRES references 15/SC/0089 and 20/SC/0226). The
median time from onset of symptoms (or positive RT-PCR test in the case of asymptomatic
infection) was 29 (0-94) days. Additionally, serum or plasma samples were obtained from
University College London Hospitals (UCLH) COVID-19 patients testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR and sampled between March 2020 and April 2020
(18). The sera were collected a median of 21 (9-31) days post onset of symptoms. Patient
sera were from residual samples prior to discarding, in accordance with Royal College
Pathologists guidelines and the UCLH Clinical Governance for assay development and
approved by HRA (IRAS reference 284088). All serum or plasma samples were heat-treated
at 56°C for 30 min prior to testing by flow cytometry.

IgG capture assay
WT (depleted of biliverdin by chromatography under acidic conditions) and mutant SARSCoV-2 S1 proteins (4.1 mg/ml; 100 l) were conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP)
using the Lynx rapid HRP conjugation kit (BioRad). Following quenching and dilution in
conjugate stabiliser (Clintech, Guildford, UK; product code #MI20080), half of each
conjugate was supplemented with 10 M biliverdin. Nunc 96-well, U8 MaxiSorp plates
(Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4°C with AffiniPure rabbit anti-human IgG
antibody (Stratech; product code #309-005-008) diluted to 5 g/ml in coating buffer
(Clintech; product code #643005). Following a 3-h incubation at 37°C, and a 1-h incubation
at room temperature, the wells were washed with washing buffer (Clintech; product code
#20024) and incubated for 4 h in blocking solution (Clintech; product code #MI20011). The
wells were air-dried and stored desiccated at 4°C until use. For ELISA, 100-l serum
samples, each diluted 1:100 in diluent buffer (Clintech, product code #2040), were added to

the coated wells and incubated stationary at 37°C for 1 h. To detect S1-specific IgGs, the
wells were washed with washing buffer (Clintech) and aspirated to dryness, following
which 100 l of S1-HRP fusion conjugate diluted in conjugate diluent (Clintech; product
code #100171) to a previously defined optimum concentration (1:1,500) were added and
incubated for one hour at 37°C. The wells were then washed as before and developed for
30 min at 37°C using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Clintech; product code #2030b),
quenched by the addition of 50 l stop solution (Clintech; product code #20031). The
resulting optical densities (ODs) were acquired using a SpectraMax M2 reader (Molecular
Devices).
The IgG capture ELISA data was modelled with a Bayesian linear model, using the
gamma likelihood function: Gamma(μ, Scale). The linear model took the form of log(μ) =
intercept[Sample] + offset[Protein], where the intercept[Sample] term allows varying
intercepts across samples (to account for the repeated measurements of each serum sample
across conditions, assumed to be distributed as Gamma(μintercept, scaleintercept)), and the
offset[Protein] term accounts for variation attributable to different protein coatings.
Pairwise contrasts were drawn from the posterior distribution to construct credible intervals
for the difference in OD values between different protein coatings. Priors:
offset[Protein]∼Normal(−3,0.2),

scale∼Exponential(5),

μintercept∼Normal(1,0.2),

Serum antibody binding to full-length SARS-CoV-2 S expressed on HEK293T cells was
performed using a recently described method (18). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected

with an expression vector (pcDNA3) carrying codon-optimized genes encoding either the
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S (UniProt ID: P0DTC2) or N121Q SARS-CoV-2 S, using
GeneJuice (EMD Millipore). Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and
transferred into V-bottom 96-well plates (20,000 cells/well). Cells were incubated with sera
(diluted 1:50 in PBS) for 30 min, with or without addition of 10 µM biliverdin throughout
the staining period. They were then washed with FACS buffer (PBS, 5% BSA, 0.05%
sodium azide) and stained with FITC anti-IgG (clone HP6017, Biolegend), APC anti-IgM
(clone MHM-88, Biolegend) and PE anti-IgA (clone IS11-8E10, Miltenyi Biotech) for 30
min (all antibodies diluted 1:200 in FACS buffer). Samples were run on a Ze5 analyzer
(Bio-Rad) running Bio-Rad Everest software v2.4, and analyzed using FlowJo v10 (Tree
Star Inc.) analysis software. To calculate the effect of biliverdin, the mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) of positively stained cells only was used in each condition. The MFI data
was modelled with a Bayesian linear model, using the gamma likelihood function:
Gamma(μ, Scale). The linear model took the form of log(μ) = intercept[Sample] +

with 1% BSA. Monoclonal IgGs were serially diluted 10-fold from 50 µg/ml prior to mixing
with transfected cells. Antibody binding was detected with APC anti-IgG (Biolegend)
diluted 1:200 in FWB buffer. Samples were run on a NovoCyte 96-well plate flow
cytometer and analysed using FlowJo v10 (Tree Star) analysis software. Three buffer only

ELISA with monoclonal IgGs
The assays were performed in a similar manner to the previously described protocol for
serum samples (18, 63, 64). Briefly, high-binding ELISA plates (Corning, product code
3690) were coated with 3 µg/ml (25 µl per well) SARS-CoV2 WT S1 antigen (purified with
or without acid treatment) or N121Q S1 in PBS, either overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at 37 °C.
Wells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked
with 100 µl 2% casein in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were emptied and

25 µl of 2% casein in PBS was added per well. This solution was supplemented with
biliverdin at 10 µM where indicated. Serial dilutions of IgGs were prepared in separate 96well plate (Greiner Bio-One) in 2% casein, and then 25 µl of each serial dilution added to
the ELISA assay plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed with
PBS-T. Secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. IgG
binding was detected using goat-anti-human-Fc conjugated to alkaline phosphatase
(1:1,000; Jackson, product code 109-055-098). Wells were washed with PBS-T, and
alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and read at 405 nm. Area under
the curve values were calculated using GraphPad Prism.

Pseudotype infectivity assay
Simian immunodeficiency (SIV) particles were used to assess effects of H207A, R190K
and N121Q mutations on the function of SARS-CoV-2 spike. HEK293T cells, seeded one
day earlier in 10-cm dishes in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, FBS) were co-transfected with 17 µg
SIVMAC239-GFP, an env- and nef- defective provirus construct expressing a GFP reporter
(65), and 4 µg pcDNA-SARS-CoV-2-del19, encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike with or without
mutations in the biliverdin binding pocket. To improve pseudotyping efficiency, the
constructs encoded a truncation of the spike C-terminal 19 amino acids (66). Viral
pseudotypes were harvested 48 h post-transfection, clarified by low-speed centrifugation at
300g for 5 min and filtered through a 0.45-m filter. The stocks of viruses pseudotyped with
the spike variants were diluted to an equal reverse transcriptase activity (67). Six 5-fold
serially diluted virus stocks were inoculated in quadruplicate in 96-well plates onto Huh7/ACE-2 and Vero/ACE2, modified to overexpress the receptor ACE-2 from a transduced
lentiviral vector carrying the puromycin resistance gene, seeded one day before infection in

96-well plates; 48 h post-infection, fluorescent cells were counted using the Ensight plate
reader (Perkin Elmer). Infectivity was calculated from values falling into a linear dilution
range by dividing the number of infected cells in a well for the amount of reverse
transcriptase activity associated to the virus inoculum, expressed in mU.

Pseudotype neutralization assay
HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with SARS-Cov-2 spike were produced in a T75 flask seeded
the day before with 3 million HEK293T/17 cells (American Type Culture Collection;
catalogue code CRL-11268) in 10 ml complete DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100
IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using 60 μg of PEIMax (Polysciences) with a mix of three plasmids: 9.1 μg HIV-1 luciferase reporter vector
(63), 9.1 μg HIV p8.91 packaging construct (68) and 1.4 μg WT SARS-CoV-2 spike
expression vector (18) or its N121Q mutant version. Supernatants containing pseudotyped
virions were harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and stored at
-80°C. Neutralization assays were conducted by serial dilution of monoclonal IgGs at the
indicated concentrations in DMEM (10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) and
incubated with pseudotyped virus for 1 h at 37°C in 96-well plates. HeLa cells stably
expressing ACE-2 (provided by J.E. Voss, Scripps Institute)(69) were then added to the
assay (10,000 cells per 100 µl per well). After 48-72 h luminescence was assessed as a proxy
of infection by lysing cells with the Bright-Glo luciferase kit (Promega), using a Glomax
plate reader (Promega). Measurements were performed in duplicate and used to calculate
50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in GraphPad Prism software.

Vero E6 (Cercopithecus aethiops derived epithelial kidney cells, provided by Prof. Wendy
Barclay, Imperial College London) cells were grown in DMEM, supplemented with
GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% FBS, and 20 µg/ml gentamicin, and incubated
at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073)
was obtained from Public Health England. The virus was propagated by infecting Vero E6
cells in T75 flasks (60-70% confluent), at a multiplicity of infection 0.005 in 3 ml of
DMEM, supplemented with GlutaMAX and 10% FBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 oC
before adding 15 ml of the same medium. Supernatant was harvested 72 h post-infection
following visible cytopathic effect, and filtered through a 0.22-µm filter, aliquoted and
stored at -80C. The infectious virus titre was determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells.
Neutralization assays were performed as previously described (63). Cells were
seeded at a concentration of 20,000 cells/100 l per well in 96-well plates and allowed to
adhere overnight. Serial dilutions of monoclonal antibodies were prepared with DMEM
media (supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. Biliverdin was
added to the virus at a final concentration of 25 µM before addition to the antibody. The
media was removed from the pre-plated Vero-E6 cells and the serum-virus mixtures were
added to the Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. These virus/serum mixture were
aspirated and cells fixed with 150 µl of 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min
and then topped up to 300 µl with PBS. The cells were washed once with PBS and
permeabilised with 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. The cells
were washed twice with PBS and blocked using 3% milk in PBS at room temperature for
15 min. The blocking solution was removed cells were incubated with 2 µg/ml SARS-CoV2 nuclear protein-specific murinized-CR3009 antibody in PBS supplemented with 1% milk
at room temperature for 45 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and horse anti25

mouse-IgG-conjugated to HRP was added (1:2,000 in 1% milk in PBS, Cell Signaling
Technology; product code S7076) at room temperature for 45 min. The cells were washed
twice with PBS, developed using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine substrate for 30 min and
quenched using 2 M sulfuric acid prior to reading at 450 nm. Measurements were performed

Figure 3. Biliverdin decreases binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike by a group of human
monoclonal IgGs. (A) Antibodies were titrated 6-fold and assayed by direct ELISA for
binding to recombinant S1 biliverdin-depleted by purification under acidic conditions
(-biliverdin), same protein but supplemented with biliverdin (+biliverdin) or N121Q S1.
Area under the curve (AUC) is shown for IgG that were sensitive to biliverdin and two
unaffected control IgGs. AUC values are colour-coded as per the key; fold change compared
to WT protein are reported. (B) Biliverdin-sensitive IgGs were titrated 10-fold and
incubated with 293T cells expressing full-length WT or N121Q SARS-CoV-2 spike with or
without 10 μM biliverdin. Binding was detected using an anti-IgG antibody and reduction
in binding in the presence of biliverdin is shown as % MFI reduction and colour-coded as a
heatmap of the quartile values. (C) ELISA titration curves for four neutralizing IgG
including the biliverdin-insensitive control COVA1-18. (D) Relative MFI dose-dependent

titrated 5-fold against SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotype, in the presence and absence of 10
μM biliverdin, and a version of spike encoding the mutation N121Q. COVA1-18 was used
as a biliverdin-insensitive control IgG. (F) Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 (England
02/2020/407073) by IgGs was measured in the absence and presence of 10 M biliverdin

circles) or N121Q (blue circles) S1 antigen using sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected and
convalescent individuals (n=91) in the presence (vertical axis) or absence (horizontal axis)
of 10 M biliverdin. Dotted lines represent linear fit for each set (considering samples with
OD values <2.5, n = 82); the grey line is the diagonal. The inset shows posterior probability
density plots of values for pairwise contrasts (±biliverdin) for the WT and N121Q S1
proteins. Black dots indicate the median of the distribution, thick and thin line ranges
correspond to the 85% and 95% highest density interval, respectively; the dotted vertical
line indicates a zero difference. Antibodies binding to S1 epitopes, which are occluded
within protein-protein interfaces of the full-length trimeric spike, contribute to the observed
signal in this ELISA assay. Therefore, the signal differences (±biliverdin) are expected to
be less pronounced than in the flow cytometry assay, which used the complete native spike
(Fig. 2).
