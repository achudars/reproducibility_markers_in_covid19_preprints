Abstract
As the Coronavirus 2019 pandemic creates worldwide shortages of personal protective
equipment, hospitals have increasingly turned to sterilization and re-use protocols, often
without significant data supporting the specific methodologies. When using UV-C
irradiation, previously shown to be effective for decontaminating hard surfaces,
modeling shows the importance of accounting for the porosity and non-uniform
curvature of the N95 masks in decontamination procedures. Data shows a standard
2
incident dose of 1 J/cm delivered to both front and back surfaces is more than 500x
higher than the known kill dose. However, modeling indicates this would undertreat
40% of the mask material due to the curvature, path-length attenuation and scatter.
Multidirectional UV-C irradiation employing dose calibrated exposures can adjust for
this loss and best decontaminate masks. Such protocols can be rapidly implemented in
thousands of hospitals across the world equipped with UV-C irradiation lamps without
the need for additional capital equipment purchases.

Introduction

1

The Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has sickened over 6 million people around
the world, with several hundred thousand hospitalizations. The rapid influx of patients
to hospitals and intensive care units has resulted in a high demand for personal
protective equipment (PPE) with constant supply-chain pressure leading to shortages
and rationing. Fitted N95 masks which block aerosolized virus-containing droplets are
of particular importance in protecting clinicians and front-line workers from being
infected with and spreading this dangerous pathogen. While traditionally considered
single-use items, some research has looked at and tested the possibility of sanitizing
masks for re-use [1–5]. This is not yet a common practice as techniques are evolving and
the availability of necessary equipment is likely site specific.
Protocols for hospital sterilization frequently use ultraviolet C (UV-C) germicidal
irradiation to sanitize patient rooms and surgical suites. UV-C irradiation has gained

favor since it is rapid and effective for sterilizing hard surfaces, making it an ideal choice
for repeated sanitization of rooms [6]. Light at wavelengths within the UV-C band
inactivate viruses through DNA and RNA lysis. However, N95 masks and surgical
masks are engineered with complex geometries and with layers of porous material. This
creates layers within the thickness of the mask material where germs or viral particles
might penetrate and reside. If the UV-C light does not sufficiently penetrate the mask
material, the viral particles and infectious agents that can become embedded within the
layers of N95 masks may be untreated by traditional UV-C sterilization protocols
designed for treating hard surfaces.
Because UV-C light is highly absorbed by most material, this attenuation–an
exponential function of material thickness and type–and some degree of light scatter
must be considered in effective treatment planning for masks sterilization using UV-C
light. Adaptation of existing UV-C systems to this purpose [7, 8], however, allows mask
sterilization to be done at the point of care, employing equipment already within many
hospitals around the world. Here we report simulations of treatment with a focus on the
sanitization of the entire mask, including interior layers. Our findings highlight several
issues with simple illumination configurations [1] while describing an efficient protocol
for operation of UV-C treatment of masks.

Materials and methods

Setup

33

We used mathematical and computational modeling to predict the attenuation of UV-C
light rays in a decontamination apparatus where masks are suspended along parallel
lateral supports (Fig 1) with UV-C lamps placed on either side. We considered a
treatment array that is 200 cm wide x 100 cm high and targeted a minimum UV-C dose
2
of 20 mJ/cm [9, 10], up to 4x the decimation dose for viruses such as SARS-CoV-2,
across all masks within the array, shown in Fig 1a.
We used Tru-D UV-C robots (Tru-D SmartUVC, Memphis, TN), designed for room
irradiation and sterilization, to illuminate the masks, and calibrated the total intensity
of each lamp using a Gigahertz-Optik X11-1-UV3718 radiometer (Turkenfeld, Germany).
2
Lamps typically produced 2.7 J/cm over 5 minutes of exposure at a distance of 55 cm
and an elevation of 90 cm, half the height of the lamp. Treatment dose is additive and
any number of lamps may be used, although we used one lamp on each side of the
treatment array while performing protocols with either single or multiple stations.
Masks may be more difficult to treat depending on their curvature and layered
composition. We chose to perform our simulations using the 3M model 1860 because we
found it more challenging to decontaminate than other N95 masks such as the Moldex
model 2200. The Moldex N95 mask has comparable curvature and thickness, but is
significantly more transparent to UV-C light than the 3M version, which improves
exposure of the mask interior. We selected Halyard tie-back masks as a representative
flat folded surgical mask.

We modeled the dose received by each part of a medical mask by considering the
emission of ultraviolet light from a UV-C lamp, the path it took to reach its mask
target, and the angle of incidence θ at the mask surface. Energy emitted from the UV-C
lamps is assumed approximately uniform over all angles from each section of its mercury
vapor bulbs. Lamps are composed of 14 tubes, each of which was discretized into 20
light sources. Therefore each mask segment receives 14x20 light rays of distinct

Attenuation of light at a given depth increases via scattering or with larger incidence
angle θ d) UV-C dosage is attenuated as light enters the inner layers of the N95 mask
fabric, due to the effects of mask curvature on light attenuation
orientations per lamp position. Masks positioned a distance R away from the light
source receive an ultraviolet dose reduced by a factor of 1/R2 at their surface.
For a given segment of a mask on the treatment rack, the angle of incidence of each
light ray entering the fabric is cos(θ) = L · M where L is the unit light-vector from the
tube section to the mask segment, and M is the segment unit normal vector. The
density of light on the fabric decreases with distance R, but the attenuation of light as
it travels within the porous mask fabric is much more significant, and this loss is
enhanced with larger θ as the path length increases. We assumed the index of refraction
of the mask n ≈ 1.5 [11] and included surface reflection and refraction of transmitted
rays described by Snell’s law [12], which describes θt , the transmitted angle using the
relation sin(θ) = n sin(θt ). Light is attenuated exponentially as it passes through the
multiple layers of the fabric, and the energy density at depth x inside the mask segment
is the sum of components [13]:

are the transmitted angles, and λ is a material characteristic decay length. We
determined λ, assumed to be constant in the fabric, through experiments at θ = 0 with
and without the mask fabric.
The internal intensity is the sum of all rays, including exposures from multiple lamps
or lamp positions. Masks placed at some locations have receive more or less treatment
due to the relative strengths and decay (attenuation and scatter) of these rays. Data

We considered mask treatment at each point of the array where a mask could be placed.
This involved simulated exposure along a 3M N95 mask’s largest cross-sectional profile,
assuming quadratic curvature. In Fig 1 these values are reduced to a single pixel by
taking the minimum along this cross-section, while the full profile is presented in Fig 2.
As a baseline, we consider a simple protocol for these figures, where the masks are
2
exposed until a sensor at the bottom edge of the array accumulates a 300 mJ/cm
dose [1]. However because a single pair of lamp positions required impractical exposure
times to produce adequate treatment, we also designed a protocol which used two pairs
of locations. To optimize this, we maximized the minimum dose deposited in each mask
across the array, through varying both the longitudinal and lateral distances of the lamp
locations. This achieves the fastest treatment and the highest system throughput.

In Fig 1 we compare a simple protocol using a single pair of lamps against an optimized
protocol that uses illuminations from two pairs of lamps. Simulations showed marked
variation in the transmitted UV-C levels across masks, highly dependent upon their
curvature and the position of the mask relative to the light source. The contour plot
shows that the simpler arrangement does not treat N95 masks effectively, and would
require infeasible exposure times to treat masks along the entire array. Portions of
2
masks at every position received less than even a single-decimation dosage of 2 mJ/cm ,
with some surfaces not exposed directly due to mask curvature. In an optimized
protocol, however, adequate decontamination can be achieved by using our lamps for
15 minutes at each of the two optimized paired positions along the array (Fig 2). In
contrast, flat folded masks can be effectively treated even with the simple protocol, with
masks on over 87% of the array receiving the desired dose throughout their entirety.
The way in which the simple protocol fails for curved masks is illustrated in Fig 3, in
which simulated treatment dosage within individual masks is displayed. When the
masks are exposed to light from only a single direction on each side, there is an order of
magnitude more variance UV-C dosage throughout the mask volume. Masks positioned
at extreme angles receive very unequal exposure and some parts may only be
illuminated on one side. Optimized exposure from two directions leads to a much more
uniform dose. At lateral lamp positions of ±91 cm, placed a longitudinal distance 52 cm
from the array, a 2x2 lamp protocol is optimal and requires about 15 minutes exposure
per lamp, or about 30 minutes total with two robots.

For masks that cannot be flattened, the attenuation becomes more important with
larger angles of incidence, and largely determines the necessary irradiation time, which

must be set so that the delivered dose throughout every mask within the treatment
array reaches a minimum level. Light that reaches the mask surface from the UV-C
source is further absorbed by the mask material at depth (Fig 3). Incident energy which
reached the reverse side of these masks was decreased by a factor of 1000x for the 3M
N95 mask. The light transmission drop for a Moldex mask was substantially lower with
a reduction factor of approximately 100x, while flat-folded surgical masks had an
opacity between these two values. Mask curvature cannot be neglected and leads to
undertreatment of inner layers.
The minimum dose within the mask layers, across the mask surface, and along the
mask array, determines the effectiveness of treatment. Despite the symmetry of
illuminating both the front and back, one side or surface of a curved mask which is
illuminated obliquely can limit treatment effectiveness (Fig 2). However, exposure from
multiple angles mitigates imbalance and is ultimately more efficient than longer
exposure time to reach a target dose.

Another common heuristic, targeting a surface intensity dosage of 1 J/cm (on both
2
sides of the N95 mask [7]) undertreats a 20 mJ/cm target for nearly 40% of the

material in N95 masks. To efficiently achieve a dosage of 20 mJ/cm , 4-10x the
inactivation dose for viruses [9, 10] similar to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, it is

critical to know the minimum dose being delivered to each portion of the mask which
may be contaminated. We found that, throughout the full mask material, the delivered
dose distribution for any single mask showed a large variance, differing by more than
100x. This is primarily due to the curvature and difference in incident light path lengths
for locations across the mask when illuminated from a single source on both sides
(Fig 3). Increasing the number of exposure angles is an efficient way of lowering the
total treatment time, and using the optimized configuration with two positions on each
sides of the mask reduces dosage variance to ≈ 2.5x (Fig 1). There are diminishing
returns from using 3 paired locations, with only slightly greater uniformity and
efficiency at this array size.
Re-using masks helps to mitigate potential dangerous PPE shortages that would
leave clinicians and communities vulnerable to a viral pandemic. UV-C sterilization
using multiple angle exposures to ensure mask safety is a feasible option for the many
hospitals across the world that already have mobile UV-C systems. Hundreds of these
masks can be processed in a day with a single suspension system. However, care should
be taken to ensure sanitization of the mask interior layers, which is highly sensitive to
mask curvature and has been neglected in previous work. Implementation of properly
designed protocols could prevent the need for additional capital investment from
hospitals already incurring reduced revenue and increased expenses.
