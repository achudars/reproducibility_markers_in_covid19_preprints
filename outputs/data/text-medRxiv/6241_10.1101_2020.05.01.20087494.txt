ABSTRACT

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: We propose to systematically review the available evidence
to evaluate if patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases under pharmacological
treatment with immunosuppressants, immunobiologics, Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic
Drugs (DMARD) or targeted synthetic DMARDs have better or worse outcomes when
infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study is
a protocol for our rapid living systematic review. METHODS: Protocol for a rapid living
systematic review methodology following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidance. To conduct the rapid
systematic review, we will employ abbreviated systematic review methods, including: not
performing independent screens of abstracts and not searching grey literature. As this will
be a living review, it will be continuously updated.
Keywords: Immune-mediated diseases, living systematic review; COVID-19

INTRODUCTION
These days, the world is facing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2) emergency, characterized in March by the World Health Organization as a
pandemic (1). It is well established in the literature that patients with compromised immune
systems are more susceptible to viral infections and consequent development of severe
outcomes compared with the general population. Patients with rheumatic diseases, for
example, are known to present an increased infectious risk due to the disease itself and
also to the iatrogenic effect of immunosuppressive agents (3). In addition, the presence of
comorbidities often observed in these patients contributes to poor outcomes in viral
infections (2).
In contrast to this evidence, some relevant clinical reports have described patients
SARS-CoV-2 positive undergoing immunosuppressed treatment with mild symptoms and/or
no severe outcomes (3). In fact, the reports have discussed that immunosuppression may
protect COVID-19 patients from clinical complications.
Based on the knowledge of other viral infections, physicians and researchers
hypothesize that antimalarial treatments, such as chloroquine, may prevent SARS-CoV-2
infection through endocytosis (4). Moreover, it is suggested that conventional and biological
Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) may control pro-inflammatory
cytokine expression and limit tissue damage (4). Despite the propositions, many aspects of
these therapies in COVID-19 continue to be pending matters.
To address these gaps, we propose to systematically review the available evidence
to answer the following question: ‘‘Do patients with immune mediated or inflammatory
diseases under pharmacological treatment with immunosuppressants, immunobiologics,
DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs have better or worse outcomes when infected by
SARS-CoV-2?’’ This study is a protocol for our rapid living systematic review.

METHODS
This rapid living systematic review protocol will be developed following the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidance
(5), and was registered in the PROSPERO ‘‘International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews’’ (CRD42020179863). To conduct the rapid systematic review, we will

The search strategy above will be used in Medline via Pubmed and will be adapted to the specifications of each database.

Study selection
Two authors will select the studies for inclusion in the review (ACPNP and FSAR). When
duplicated studies are found, only one of them will be considered for inclusion. When
reports using the same participants and different follow-up or outcome measurements are
found, both reports will be included. However, they will be considered as parts of only one
study. After removing duplicated studies and/or reports, the authors will read the study titles
and abstracts. Studies that clearly do not fulfill the eligibility criteria will be excluded. The
remaining studies will then be fully read and assessed for inclusion in the review.
Disagreements between authors regarding the inclusion of studies will be solved by the
third author (VFMT). We will present the reasons for exclusion of the studies in a flowchart.
To optimize the process of screening and selection of studies, Rayyan application (8) will
be used.

Data extraction
Two authors (APR and FSAR) will independently extract data. Discrepancies or
disagreements will be solved by a third author (VFMT). We will use a predefined form to
extract data from included studies. The form will include information on: - the patients
(demographic and clinical characteristics); - time points used for the assessments; - the
pharmacological treatment (name of drug, treatment duration; dose); - number of patients
lost to follow-up (in each group); - reasons for loss to follow-up; - approach for handling
missing data (data imputation/how data imputation was performed, use of intention-to-treat
approach); - sources of funding; - possibility of conflict of interests; - adverse events; outcome measures; - protocol deviations.
Assessment of methodological quality in included studies and quality of the body of
evidence
We will use Risk of Bias tool (7) as recommended by Cochrane Collaboration to perform
the critical appraisal of included studies; for observational studies, we will use Newcastle
Ottawa Scale (9). The quality of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) (10). Assessment
of risk of bias (VTC and APR), and assessment of the quality of evidence (VTC and NCJ)
will be performed by two authors, and all the disagreements in the assessment of the risk of
bias or quality of evidence will be solved through discussion or, if required, by consulting
with a third author (ANA).
Data Analysis
We will perform analyses according to the recommendations of Cochrane, and the
Cochrane Prognosis Methods Group. To perform the meta-analysis we will use R software
when possible for mean difference (MD) or Hedge’s/Cohen’s (SMD). The package to be
used is the “meta” (version 4.11-0).
We will pool mean and the standard deviation (or equivalent) for hospital admission,
intensive care unit admission and/or respiratory support for adult inpatients with COVID-19
and mortality, by the inverse of variance method with random-effects model (DerSimonianLaird estimator for τ2). Thus, just similar or equivalent results obtained by each primary
outcome in the studies can be used. It is necessary to ensure the main assumptions to

provide the correct data and to guarantee the correct interpretation. When allowed by the
information of the studies results the correct statistical standardization will be provided.
Aftermath, just the robust and reliable data based on equivalents primary outcomes can be
used to attend the objective of this meta-analysis.
All described in the Data Extraction section for each measure must be separated according
to the response categories of the interest. The data about the adverse events and clinical
exams can be extracted since complete available and classified by the response as well.
Dealing with missing data
For studies that do not provide a mean and associated standard deviation (SD), we will use
information and results reported in the text or tables, doing the correct inference. When the
parameters established before are not available, the estimate based on other parameters
will be made ensuring the correct information.
We will contact the principal investigators of the included studies asking for additional data
or to clarify issues about the studies. In the absence of a reply from the authors, we will
expose the data in a descriptive manner avoiding imputation.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We will employ the Cochran’s Q test to assess the presence of heterogeneity considering a
threshold of P value < 0.1 as an indicator of whether heterogeneity is present.
In addition, we will assess statistical heterogeneity by examining the Higgins I2 statistic
following these thresholds:
·

< 25%: no (none) heterogeneity;

·

25% to 49%: low heterogeneity;

·

50% to 74%: moderate heterogeneity;

·

≥ 75%: high heterogeneity.

We will consider the following information for heterogeneity analysis:

- Drug treatment (number of drugs, duration of drug treatment, dose, and type of drug
treatment)
- Comorbidities
- Age
- Route of administration

Sensitivity analysis
- Studies with high risk of bias
Assessment of reporting biases
When at least 10 studies are included in a meta-analysis we will explore the likelihood of
reporting biases visually inspecting funnel plots. For continuous outcomes, Egger’s test will
be used to detect possible small study bias as recommended in Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
DISCUSSION
When the first reports about COVID-19 pathophysiology and clinical manifestations started
to be published, there were some concerns with patients undergoing immunosuppressed
treatment (3). However, unlike common viral agents, SARS-CoV-2 has not been shown to
cause a more severe disease in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (5).
To the best of our knowledge, the potential protective capacity of these drugs has not been
properly evaluated and remains uncertain.
This rapid living review will systematically evaluate the best available evidence on the
possible protective effect of drugs used in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory
diseases for COVID-19. We expect it will help clinicians in their decision-making processes
as, to date, no treatment has proven effective for treating COVID-19.
As we will follow the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews recommendations (7) and
use extensive searches in the largest health databases, we believe we will be able to
summarize the current available evidence and to clarify the potential of these drugs in
preventing severe course of COVID-19.
