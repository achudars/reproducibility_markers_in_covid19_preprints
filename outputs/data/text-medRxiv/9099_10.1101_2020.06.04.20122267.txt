ABSTRACT
Iron metabolism and anemia may play an important role in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). If confirmed, this has important implications for the more
than 1.62 billion people estimated to have anemia globally. We conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis to evaluate biomarkers of anemia and iron metabolism (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin,
soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, haptoglobin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, erythropoietin,
free erythrocyte protoporphyrine, and prevalence of anemia) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19,
and explore their prognostic value. Six bibliographic databases were searched up to May 5th 2020. We
included 56 unique studies, with data from 14,044 COVID-19 patients (59 years median age). Pooled
mean hemoglobin and ferritin levels in COVID-19 patients across all ages were 130.41 g/L (95%
Confidence Interval (CI), 128.42; 132.39) and 673.91 ng/mL (95% CI, 420.98; 926.84), respectively.
Hemoglobin levels decreased with advancing age and increasing percentage of comorbid and critically
ill patients, while levels of ferritin increased with increasing male proportion and mean hemoglobin
levels. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases had lower pooled mean hemoglobin [weighted mean
difference (WMD), -4.21 (95% CI -6.63; -1.78)] and higher ferritin [WMD, -730.55 ng/mL (95% CI
413.24; 1047.85)]. A significant difference in mean ferritin level of 1027.23 ng/mL (95% CI 819.53;
1234.94) was found between survivors and non-survivors, but not in hemoglobin levels. No studies
provided information on anemia or other biomarkers of interest. Future studies should explore the
impact of iron metabolism and anemia and in the pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of
COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) often results in
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease that endangers disproportionately the elderly, those
with pre-existing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension(1, 2). If deteriorating, Covid-19 can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome, with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation having
low therapeutic efficacy(3). The pathophysiological background underlying deterioration and low
efficacy of common treatments is unclear.
Most patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care will develop an atypical form of the acute
distress respiratory syndrome (ARDS) with preserved lung gas volume (4), suggesting hypoxia due to
physiological processes other than alveolar dysfunction may play a role in the prognosis of the
disease(5). Disturbed iron metabolism may be one such affected process. Indeed, recent data show that
COVID-19 patients tend to present decreased hemoglobin levels indicating the presence of anemia,
and pathologically increased levels of ferritin. A study of 67 COVID-19 patients in Singapore reported
that during their course in an intensive care unit (ICU), patients developed more profound and
significantly lower hemoglobin levels, compared to patients not admitted to ICU(6). Another study in
elderly patients hospitalized for COVID-19 found that most patients had hemoglobin levels lower than
the normal range, but did not find significant differences in hemoglobin levels between survivors and
non-survivors. However, follow-up was incomplete for half of the patients(7). In a report of 5700
patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the New York City area, ferritin levels were pathologically
high, a finding in line with previous studies from China (8, 9). Both anemia and hyperferritenemia,
regardless of the underlying pathology, are strong predictors of mortality(10, 11). Anemia could be the
result of iron-restricted erythropoiesis arising from alterations in iron metabolism. Increased ferritin
levels could be indicative of a strong inflammatory reaction in COVID-19 or related to viral entry into
the human body and its impact on iron metabolism(12, 13). Iron is an essential micronutrient for both
humans and pathogens(14). The innate immune response could restrict iron availability during
infections to deprive the pathogen of it, a mechanism that would also lead to anemia (15, 16). Anemia,
in turn, reduces oxygen delivery to the tissue and may thus play an important role in the development

of multi organ failure. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relation between anemia, iron
metabolism and progression of COVID-19, and whether these associations differ by age, sex and
presence of chronic conditions.
We thus conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of available observational evidence to (i)
quantify the mean levels of hemoglobin, ferritin and other biomarkers of iron metabolism in COVID19 patients, (ii) explore whether the levels would differ by age, sex presence of chronic conditions and
severity of COVID-19, and (iii) whether these biomarkers could have clinical and/or prognostic utility
in COVID-19.

METHODS
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to a recent published guideline and
reported according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses) guidelines17). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO and is available in
https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=180670.

Data source and strategy
We searched MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, US), EMBASE (Elsevier, Netherlands), Web
of Science (Clarivate Analytics, US), Cochrane (Cochrane Collaboration, UK), the WHO COVID-19
database and Google Scholar (Google, Inc., US) to identify relevant articles. We used search terms
related to COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV-2 virus, and several markers of anemia and iron
storage and metabolism, including hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, soluble transferrin receptor,
hepcidin, haptoglobin, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, erythropoietin and free erythrocyte
protoporphyrin. We also included search terms related to clinical progression of COVID-19 such as
prognosis, severity, ICU admission, mortality, risk factors, clinical features, clinical characteristics or
predictors. We searched the databases from inception until May 05th 2020. We limited our search to
human studies and restricted our analysis to articles published in English. The detailed search
strategies are presented in eAppendix 1.

Study selection and eligibility criteria
All observational studies (e.g., cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies), except for case
reports and case-series, were included. We included studies that reported on the levels of the
biomarkers of iron metabolism, erythropoietin or hemoglobin levels, the prevalence of anemia in
COVID-19 patients, or their levels by the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. Outcomes of
interest include disease severity, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and
mortality across all age groups. Studies examining the association between the biomarkers of interest
and risk of COVID-19 complications (e.g., admission to intensive care unit, death) were also included.

Data extraction
Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts according to the selection criteria. We
recorded data on the author's name, study location, study design, sample size, clinical characteristics,
laboratory results, disease severity, and outcome in a data extraction form. The form was developed,
piloted, and discussed within the review group before full data extraction. All laboratory values were
extracted as reported and then converted to conventional units based on the US National Institute of
Standards and Technology conversion factors. For studies reporting only median and ranges
(interquartile range, range, and maximum-minimum values), we converted these values into mean and
standard deviation (Hozo, 2015).

Risk of Bias assessment
The quality of included studies was assessed by two authors independently using the NewcastleOttawa Scale for case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies, as applicable. A third author
adjudicated in case consensus was not reached. The scale was developed for non-randomized and
observational studies and assesses quality in three broad categories, namely, selection of study
groups/participants, comparability of the study groups/participants, and the assessment of
exposure/outcome of interest. Quality was assessed on a 10-point scale and classified as good quality
(9-10 points), fair quality (6-8), and poor quality (<6).

Data synthesis and analysis
Based on the extracted data of each study, we computed pooled means and standard deviations for
each biomarker and anemia prevalence for all COVID-19 patients, and weighted mean difference in
levels of biomarkers between severe vs. moderate cases, and survivors vs. non- survivors. For the
adult population, anemia was defined according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
(hemoglobin levels for males <130 g/L and for females <120 g/L). We pooled mean difference by
using a random-effects model (DerSImonian and Laird, 1986). Geographical location, age group
(pediatric vs. adult), the mean age of the study population, gender distribution, percentage of
comorbidities and proportion of patients admitted to ICU were pre-specified as characteristics for
assessment of heterogeneity and were evaluated using stratified analyses and univariate random effects
meta-regression. Publication bias was appraised using funnel plot as well as Egger's test for assessing
asymmetry. We used STATA 15.1 (Statacorp, Texas, US, 2017) for all the analyses. We only
calculated 2-tailed tests. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Study Identification and Selection

1302 unique citations were identified of which 178 were selected for full-text evaluation. Of those, 56
observational studies comprising 14,044 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were included for
further analysis (Figure 1). References of the 56 included studies can be found in the Supplemental
Material. Forty-nine studies provided information on blood hemoglobin, and eighteen studies provided
information on serum ferritin. We did not find studies reporting on other markers of iron metabolism
or providing information on anemia according to WHO age and sex-specific criteria or on
erythropoietin. Detailed characteristics of the included studies can be found in Supplemental Table
S1. In brief, besides three studies conducted in the USA (n=2) and Italy (n=1), all identified studies
were conducted in Asia. The majority of studies were conducted in an adult population (n=39, 69.6%),
fifteen studies (24.7%) included both pediatric and adult patients, and two studies included pediatric
patients only. The median age of the mean population age was 59 years (IQR 48-63.7 years), the
median proportion of males was 60.3% (IQR 49.5-67.5%) and the median percentage of patients
having comorbidities was 46% (IQR 32.8-49).

Serum Hemoglobin Levels
Based on findings from 49 observational studies, including 8,828 individuals, pooled mean
hemoglobin level was 130.41 g/L (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 128.42; 132.39; I2=98.3%, P-value
for heterogeneity<0.001), Table 1 and eFigure 1. Compared to studies including individuals with
mean age below 50.33 (overall median age of all studies), studies with mean population age above
50.33 years had higher mean hemoglobin levels [133.033 g/L (95% CI 131.20; 135.145) vs. 127.15
g/L (95% CI 125.13; 129.17)] (Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, after regressing the mean age
per study and mean serum hemoglobin levels, a significant linear trend was observed, with mean
serum hemoglobin levels decreased with increasing age (Figure 2a). Also, studies including
exclusively adult populations, had lower mean serum hemoglobin levels in comparison to studies
including both adults and pediatric individuals [129.15g/L (95% CI 126.58; 131.71) vs. 133.59g/L

(95% CI 131.04; 136.414)] (Supplemental Table S2). The stratified analysis showed lower mean
hemoglobin levels in studies including patients with a higher prevalence of comorbidities, especially
of type 2 diabetes, and with a higher proportion of patients admitted to ICU, while no differences were
observed by the proportion of males and the percentage of survivors by the end of the study
(Supplementary Table S2). Fitting regression lines showed similar results, albeit no significant for
type 2 diabetes (Supplementary Table S2, Figure 2b and eFigure 5). Huang et al. reported reduction
in hemoglobin levels in 38.2% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, but did not specify the
definition of decreased hemoglobin(18); while Wang et al reported decreased hemoglobin level
(<110g/L) in 19.23% of the study population admitted to hospital(1). In contrast, Xiu et al studied
asymptomatic patients and reported none of the cases had decreased hemoglobin levels (19), albeit not
defining the cut-off of decreased levels.
When comparing mean hemoglobin levels in severe and moderate cases (using data from 19 studies
and 3,251individuals with COVID-19), severe cases had lower hemoglobin levels [weighted mean
difference (WMD), -4.21 (95% CI -6.63; -1.78); I2=62.6%, P-value for heterogeneity<0.001] (Table
2, eFigure 2). When comparing pooled estimates from studies above (18.95%) vs. below median
(≤18.95%) the percentage of patients at ICU, WMD was larger in studies above the median [WMD 8.03 (95% CI -9.95; 6.12) vs. -2.62 (95% CI -5.41; 0.16) respectively; p-value=0.04 ] (Supplemental
Table S3). Nevertheless, age, percentage of male population and percentage of comorbidities were not
major sources of heterogeneity (Supplemental Table S3, eFigure 6). Based on retrospective data
from 245 individuals with COVID-19, Liu et al. found that the unadjusted association between
baseline hemoglobin levels and all-cause mortality during hospitalization was non-significant, and the
odds ratio of death with increasing serum hemoglobin level was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96, 1.00, p=
0.05)(20). Similarly, based on data from six studies we did not find a significant difference in
hemoglobin levels between survivors and non- survivors [WMD, 0.24 (95% CI -2.39; 2.88); I2=0%, Pvalue for heterogeneity=0.85] (Table 1 and eFigure 2).

Serum Ferritin Levels

Based on findings from ten observational studies, including 5,565 COVID-19 patients, pooled mean
ferritin level was 673 ng/mL (95% CI 420.98; 926.85) (Table 1 and eFigure 4). When excluding a
single study performed in a pediatric population, the mean pooled ferritin level was 737.58 ng/mL
(95% CI 539.93; 935.24) (Table 1 and eFigure 4). Due to the limited number of studies we were only
able to perform subgroup analyses comparing pooled ferritin levels in studies below and above median
age (56.7 years) and the proportion of the males (62.4%) and found no significant differences
(Supplementary Table S3). Yet, when regressing the mean age per study and mean serum ferritin
levels we observed a significant linear trend with mean serum ferritin levels increasing with advancing
age and the proportion of the male population (Figure 2c&d); After removing the single study
performed in a pediatric population the trend between mean ferritin levels and age became nonsignificant (eFigure 7). Furthermore, when fitting regression lines using data from 7 studies (in adult
patients), we observed a positive significant linear trend between mean ferritin and hemoglobin levels
(Figure 2e).
When pooling estimates from four studies and 154 individuals, the mean difference in serum ferritin
was higher in severe COVID-19 individuals compared to moderate cases; [ WMD, 730.55 (95% CI
413.24; 1047.85) (Table 2 and eFigure 3b). Finally, pooling the estimates from four observational
studies and 561 individuals we found a large statistically significant difference in mean ferritin levels
of 1027.23 ng/mL between non-survivors and survivors [ WMD, 1027.23 (95% CI 819.53; 1234.94)
(Table 1 and eFigure 3). In line with this finding, Zhou et al., found in a univariable analysis that
odds of in hospital death were higher among patients with ferritin levels above 300ng/mL compared to
those with serum ferritin ≤399ng/mL( odds ratio was 9.10 (95% CI 2.04; 40.58, p=0.0038). Indeed,
levels of serum ferritin were elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors (562 ng/mL±492

ng/mL) throughout the clinical course, and were increased with disease deterioration(3). Similarly, in a
study by Li et al., ferritin was significantly higher in severe cases (21).

Quality of studies and Publication Bias
Six (10,7%) of the included studies were evaluated at low risk of bias, while the rest at medium risk of
bias (Supplemental table S1 and S4). Due to the limited number of studies included in comparative
analyses of severity and survival of COVID-19, we could only test for publication bias in studies
focusing on hemoglobin levels and comparing severe vs. non-severe cases, and survivors vs. nonsurvivors and found no evidence for publication bias (eFigure 7).

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first updated and comprehensive systematic
review and meta-analyses acknowledging the potential clinical utility of anemia and iron metabolism
in COVID-19 . Based on data from 56 studies and 14,044 COVID-19 patients across all ages, we
found a pooled mean hemoglobin level of 130.41 g/L, which decreased with older age, higher
proportion of comorbid illness and severity. We also found pathological values of ferritin in most
patients, a finding more prominent in men and elderly. Major differences in ferritin levels were
reported between different levels of severity, and among patients who survived and those who did not.
We did not find any study in COVID-19 patients investigating the levels of biomarkers of iron status
other than ferritin, and prevalence of anemia according to age and sex- WHO cut-off.

The mean level of hemoglobin in COVID-19 patient across all-ages found in this review represents a
borderline value regarding the value for anemia diagnosis in men as defined by WHO (<130 g/L), with
anemic mean levels observed in the elderly, and in severe cases. Indeed, a study in 339 hospitalized
elderly COVID-19 patients found that the majority of patients had mean values of hemoglobin lower
than normal(7). However, most of the studies did not report hemoglobin levels by sex, and none of the
studies reported the prevalence of anemia based on age and sex-specific WHO cut-offs. Thus, it was
challenging to provide an accurate picture of the burden of anemia in COVID-19 patients. The SASR2

COV-2 infection is associated with high mortality, especially among the elderly over the age of 65+
and comorbid patients.

Hemoglobin concentration is one of the most important determinants of the oxygen-carrying capacity
of the blood. Low hemoglobin in COVID-19 patients, especially on populations at risk of
complications and mortality, could indicate that the patients could suffer from a decreased capability
of hemoglobin to support the increased peripheral tissue demands for oxygen due to the hypermetabolic states during infection. Indeed, significant complications of COVID-19 patients are sepsis,
septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation having low efficacy in mitigating its impact and progression(3). According to
recent evidence, COVID-19 patients do experience an atypical form of the acute distress respiratory
syndrome with preserved lung gas volume(4), suggesting that the prognosis could depend on the
ability of the human body to meet the oxygen demands of the peripheral tissues, which, if not met,
may lead to hypoxia and ischemia. Studies have reported that anemia is associated with 2.6 times
increased risk of mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; the overall 90-day mortality
among these patients with acute respiratory failure treated with invasive mechanical ventilation was
57.1% versus 25% in non-anemic patients(22, 23). A previous meta-analysis has shown that among a
mixed population, independent of sex, age and cardiovascular diseases, anemia is associated with a
41% and 33% increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, respectively (11). A
similar risk of mortality was also shown in two other meta-analyses comparing heart failure patients
with and without anemia, or stroke patients with and without anemia(24, 25). Also, another metaanalysis has shown that lower baseline hemoglobin values in heart failure patients are associated with
increased crude mortality rates (r = -0.396, p = 0.025)(24). In this meta-analysis we show that the
severity of disease and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 might depend on lower hemoglobin
levels as severe cases had significantly lower hemoglobin levels than moderate cases. Future
prospective studies with complete follow-up are needed to confirm the impact of anemia in COVID-19
outcomes, and whether the incidence of low hemoglobin levels does predict mortality in these patients.

A striking finding of this meta-analysis is the pathological value of ferritin among COVID-19 patients,
with significant differences between severe and moderate cases, and survivors and non-survivors.
Ferritin is known to be elevated in inflammatory conditions, with hyperferritinemia being a key acutephase reaction used by clinicians as a marker for therapeutic response (12). However, recent studies
suggest that increased levels of circulating ferritin levels may not only reflect an acute-phase response,
but also play a critical role in inflammation by contributing to the development of a cytokine
storm(12). According to Shoenfeld et al., the clinical picture of the critical cases of COVID-19
resembles macrophage activating syndrome, which is commonly associated with high levels of ferritin
or even a cytokine storm(26). H-chain of the ferritin could be important in activating macrophages to
increase the secretion of inflammatory cytokines observed in COVID-19 patients(26). Another
explanation for the increased levels of ferritin could be the role of iron metabolism in supporting the
innate immune system to fight invading microorganisms. The innate immune system orchestrates
control over iron metabolism as a response to viral infections. For viral replication, enhanced cellular
metabolism and optimal iron levels within host cells are necessary(13, 27). Therefore, the innate
immune system will react by decreasing the bioavailability of iron to limit the replication of the virus
during the acute phase of infection. In these conditions, through interleukin-6 and Toll-like-receptor-4
dependent pathways, the levels of the liver-derived iron hormone hepcidin-the master regulator of iron
homoestasis- could increase and block, the activity of the transporter ferroportin which carries iron out
of the cells, and therefore decrease the amount of iron absorbed from the diet, causing cellular
sequestration of iron (i.e., principally in hepatocytes, enterocytes, and macrophages)(27). Increased
intracellular iron sequestration will lead to an upregulation of cytosolic ferritin which sequesters and
stores iron to prevent iron-mediated free radical damage (27). The increased retention and storage of
iron within ferritin in macrophages contribute to the characteristic fall in serum iron concentrations
and an increase in serum ferritin concentrations as observed in an acute phase response(28). The net
result will be a diminished iron availability for erythropoiesis and as a result further aggravation of
anemia. Regardless of the etiology, serum ferritin is highly elevated in patients with COVID-19, and it
seems warranted to assess whether serum ferritin could be used as a screening biomarker for the
severity of the inflammatory state that patients with COVID-19 have.

Our systematic review highlights important gaps in the role of iron biomarkers other than ferritin in
the prognosis of COVID-19. Of the included iron status parameters, only information on ferritin levels
was available. Future studies should measure also other iron status parameters to establish whether
iron-restricted erythropoiesis is inflicting anemia, and whether anemia is contributing to poor
outcomes. Assessing the other stated parameters and interpreting them with respect to iron status in the
setting of inflammation will be a challenging task. Therefore, the inclusion of soluble transferrin
receptor (sTfR) could be of additive value for iron-restricted erythropoiesis, as elevated levels of sTfR
reflect both erythroid activity and functional iron deficiency. The markers is known to be less affected
by concomitant chronic disease or inflammation. Future prospective population-based and clinical
studies are necessary to investigate the utility of using levels of hemoglobin levels and iron biomarkers
for risk stratification and to identify patients who could benefit from early prevention strategies.
Provided that anemia and altered iron metabolism play a role in COVID-19, public health strategies
may be designed to protect this the population that could be at risk of COVID-19 complications.

This study has several limitations. First, considering we restricted our review to articles in English, we
cannot rule out publication bias, which could limit our overall findings. Second, the interpretation of
the findings should be based on the quality of the included studies. Despite most studies being of high
quality, the data provided are mainly of cross-sectional nature. Third, there was heterogeneity in the
definition of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 patients and in the definition of comorbid
patients, which could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity in our meta-analysis.

This meta-analysis suggests that hemoglobin and ferritin levels vary according to the severity of
COVID-19 as well as age, gender and presence of comorbidity among COVID-19 patients. Whether
hemoglobin and ferritin can be used for prognostic purposes, or have further implications for
identifying novel treatment targets, needs further investigation
