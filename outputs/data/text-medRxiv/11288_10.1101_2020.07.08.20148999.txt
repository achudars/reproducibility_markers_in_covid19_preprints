Abstract: Until vaccines and effective therapeutics become available, the practical solution
to transit safely out of the current coronavirus disease 19 (CoVID-19) lockdown may include
the implementation of an effective testing, tracing and tracking system. However, this
requires a reliable and clinically validated diagnostic platform for the sensitive and specific
identification of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report on the development of a de novo, highresolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to
remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of results, we engineered a
novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further
furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms, and the collated
data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay
run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI
algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A
total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected NHS patient samples were tested
using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more
sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. Therefore, system could provide an
efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.

1. Introduction
A cluster of new pneumonia cases was reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO) in late 2019 from Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. The causative agent was named
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and led to a global
pandemic [1–3]. While the major impact of SARS-CoV-2 was attributed to frail and elderly
people with co-morbidities, coronavirus disease 2019 (CoVID-19) was mainly spread by
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients [2]. Due to their high mutation rates and
recombination events, coronaviruses can infect a range of animal species including humans,
avian, rodents, carnivores, chiropters and other mammals [4]. Prior to the emergence of
SARS-CoV-2, a total of six different coronaviruses had been reported to infect humans,
including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS and SARS-CoV-1
(also known as classical SARS). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus of the group
2B within the family of Coronaviridae [3].
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a high level of genetic similarity (up to 96%) with
coronaviruses originating from bats [3]. The genome of β-coronavirus encodes for the
replicase complex (ORF1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N)
genes in addition to the several non-structural and accessory proteins in the order from 5’untranslated to 3’-untranslated regions [3]. Owing to the nature of viral genetics, the N gene
is the most transcribed and highly conserved gene within the Coronaviridae family and has
been a major target for both antigen and antibodies diagnostics. Across the genome, the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), encoded by the ORF1b gene segment, presents
a high level of intra-group conservation and therefore is an ideal target for a diagnostic
application [5, 6].
As evident by previous coronaviruses associated pandemics and other viral diseases,
a highly specific, sensitive and easily deployable diagnostic is critical for the identification,
tracing, rationalizing control measures, documentation of symptomatic and asymptomatic
carriers [7-12]. Additionally, due to the unavailability of the registered vaccines or effective
therapeutics, rapid and reliable diagnostics are of paramount importance to curtail SARSCoV-2 infection. Because of shortcomings associated with the virus isolation (time
consuming and required containment) and cross-reactivities of antigen and antibodies
assay, several real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) and
reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays have been
developed, validated and commercialized as useful laboratory diagnostics for the detection
of SARS-CoV-2 [13]. However, the majority of these assays are time-consuming and require
laboratory-intense instrumentation. Furthermore, they are unable to meet the current
unprecedented rapid growth and demand for testing a large proportion of the population,
identification of asymptomatic carriers and contact tracing.
Though qRT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, RTLAMP assays have been demonstrated to produce diagnostic results with increased
sensitivity and specificity [14]. Furthermore, its ability to tolerate PCR inhibitors eliminates
the need for laborious RNA extraction and purification methodologies [15, 16]. Several
platforms capable of performing LAMP assays in the field have previously been documented
[17]. However, most platforms have employed fluorescence detection with integrated optical
units or a smart phone dock to achieve detection [18, 19]. Similarly, for colorimetric LAMP
assays, smart phone cameras or user interpretation of the colour changes were used to
achieve detection [20, 21]. The fully integrated real-time fluorescence-based platforms are
expensive, and the smartphone-based platforms are only designed for specific smartphone
models. Therefore, to fulfil the need for a standalone colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid
amplification platform [22], we have developed an ultra-low-cost molecular diagnostic device
with an integrated single-board computer, imaging camera, artificial intelligence-based
image processing algorithm and mobile app.
In this study, we developed a high-resolution comparative genomics analysis-guided
novel RT-LAMP assay for the specific and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison
to WHO recommended qRT-PCR assays. In order to provide a simple “sample-to-answer

workflow”, an ultra-low-cost and user-friendly diagnostic platform was engineered and
further enhanced with a module for automated image acquisition and processing. Artificial
intelligence-guided assessment of the LAMP assay provided faster detection of colour
changes in the LAMP reaction, further enhancing the assay performance and thus reducing
the potential for human error in results interpretation. Finally, the assay was validated on
RNA extracted from clinical samples from SARS-CoV-2 suspected patients to demonstrate
the real-life applicability.

This study was conducted in accordance with the University Human ethics guidelines
and received a favourable review from the Faculty of Health and Medicine Research Ethics
Committee (FHMREC) of Lancaster University - reference number FHMREC19112. The
study was exempt from requiring specific patient consent, as it only involved the use of
extracted RNA and existing collections of data or records that contained non-identifiable
data about human patients.
2.2. Cells and viruses
Vero cells and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Gibco), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco) and 100U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C in
5% CO2. Influenza A virus (A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008(H9N2), Newcastle disease
virus strain LaSota and Infectious bronchitis virus strain H120, Vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV) and Sendai virus (SeV) were propagated and used to determine the specificity of the
LAMP. All viruses except influenza were titrated on Vero and MDCK cells, respectively by
the standard plaque assay.
2.3. In silico nucleotide sequence comparisons and primer design
To design specific LAMP primer sets for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, all available
complete
genome
sequences
were
downloaded
from
GISAID
Initiative
(https://www.gisaid.org/), aligned and the conserved part was selected and used as the
template of LAMP primer design. To find out an efficient primer set, three sets of specific
LAMP primers were hand-picked and validated using PrimerExplorer V5 software
(http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html). Primers were validated using BLAST
software (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/BLAST) to ensure their specificity.
2.4. Cloning and in vitro transcription of RdRP target gene
The coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene was chemically synthesized and
cloned into pVAX1 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) between KpnI and NotI restriction
sites. The plasmid was propagated in DH5α cells and purified using MiniPrep Qiagen Kits.
The linearized plasmid with pVAX1-RdRP was used for in vitro transcription using T7
RiboMAX™ Express Large-Scale RNA Production System (Promega, USA). The copy
number of in vitro transcribed RNA was calculated from RNA concentration measured with
NanoDrop™ 2000c Spectrophotometers (Thermo, USA) in triplicate. RNA products were
then purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). A
standard curve was generated using dilutions of the standard in vitro transcribed RNAs using
SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) using CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System is
(Applied Biosystems, USA).
2.5. Clinical sample processing and spiking with miR-cel-miR-39-3p RNA
A total of 199 nasopharyngeal swabs were individually collected from CoVID-19
suspected patients, through routine NHS collection procedure for COVID-19 screening.
These samples were stored and transported in the virus transport media (VTM) to the NHS

diagnostic laboratory at Lancaster University, UK. All samples were individually spiked with
50 pmol/L of synthesized Caenorhabditis elegans miR-cel-miR-39-3p (Applied
Biosystems/Thermo-Fisher Scientific, UK). The miR-cel-miR-39-3p RNA lacked any
sequence homology to human or viral gene and thus present an ideal RNA extraction
control. Total RNA including miRNAs was extracted using 140 μL of the spiked-VTM by the
commercial QIAampViral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). The miR-cel-miR-393p RNA was used to serve as an internal control to monitor extraction efficiency and used
for data normalization. The final RNA yield and purity were determined by the A260/A280
ratio measured by a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies/Thermo-Fisher Scientific, UK) with a ratio of 1.80 to 2.00 indicative of good
RNA purity. The isolated RNA was stored at −80 °C for further use.
2.6. Real-time fluorescent-based quantitative PCR
Suspected SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples were tested for positivity by qRT-PCR. Briefly,
RNA was extracted from Viral Transport Media using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, California) following the manufacturer instructions. The qRT-PCR was conducted
using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol
(Invitrogen Carlsbad, USA) in the CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad,
USA), according to the cycling protocol. The reaction was performed using the specific
primer set RdRpF; RdRpR and FAM-labelled probe or NP-F; NP-R and ROX labelled probes
designed to detect SARS-CoV2. The 25-µl PCR reaction consists of 12.5 µl 2X Reaction
Mix, 0.2 µM of each primer, and 0.1 µM probe, 0.5 µl of SuperScript® III RT/Platinum® Taq
Mix, 5 µl of RNA sample and nuclear free water. The cycling program was performed in the
CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System is (Applied Biosystems, USA), according
to the cycling protocol. The amount of viral RNA in each sample was estimated by comparing
the cycle threshold values (Ct) to the standard curve made by serial 10-fold serial dilutions
of previously titrated in vitro transcribed RdRP gene.
2.7. ai-LAMP assay performance
All experiments for LAMP were run in triplicate. The LAMP reactions were performed
using WarmStartTM Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs). A 10X primer
mix (FIP, 16 µM; BIP, 16 µM; F3, 2 µM; B3, 2 µM; LF, 4 µM; LB, 4 µM) was prepared. A 25
µl reaction mixture (12.5 µl 2X MasterMix; 2.5 µl 10X primer mix; 2.5 µl RNA and 7.5 µl
DNase & RNase-free molecular grade water) was mixed homogeneously and centrifuged.
The LAMP assays were performed in a thermocycler (MJResearch) at 65°C for 30 min or in
the engineered device (Figure 4A). Colour change was observed directly by the naked eye
or through AI image processing, and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm
the results. The completion of amplification was indicated by the colour in the tube, wherein
yellow was considered positive and pink was regarded as negative. All amplicons were
confirmed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.
2.8. Artificial intelligence based test-tube colour detection
A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay based COVID-19 test device
was developed to capture the COVID-19 test results in 30 minutes, based on colour
changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) based colour detection was proposed to identify colour
changes considering different lighting issues and to reduce the test running time less than
30 minutes. Images were acquired from the COVID-19 test kit which carried 8 test-tubes
including NTC (negative test control) and PTC (positive test control) for every 20 seconds
during the test operation. Each image was cropped into separate tubes using template
matching approach and labelled manually based on their colour.
2.9. Analytical specificity and analytical sensitivity of the LAMP assay
The designed RdRp primer sets for LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 were validated for
their specificity by testing the cross-reactivity with other viruses, including influenza A virus,
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Sendai virus (SeD), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and
Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Likewise, the developed LAMP assay was evaluated to test

serial dilutions. The amplification patterns were observed for each dilution to determine the
lowest amount of absolute RNA template required for detectable amplification. The degree
of colour intensity of the amplified product as well as the observed electrophoretic pattern
during gel electrophoresis was used for the analysis of LAMP amplification.

It is imperative to critically assess the evolving nature of viruses in identifying conserved
gene signatures and guiding the selection of the most appropriate primers. In order to
identify important genomic loci, we downloaded and aligned all the available full-length
genomes with high coverage sequences (n=22858) of SARS-CoV-2 by Multiple Alignment
using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT) [24]. We then compiled in house R-code (available
on request) to determine the single nucleotide-based genetic conservation across the length
of ~30kb genome. The analysis of the aligned dataset of all genomes in the RStudio
generated a total of 18GB high-resolution nucleotide-by-nucleotide score from 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0
being the highly conserved and 0.0 being the highly divergent). Plotting the assessed genetic
divergence, at a cut-off point of 90% similarity along with the genome of the SARS-CoV-2,
identified sharp divergence at multiple loci (Figure 1A). However, most of the genomes
maintained high conservation. The divergence at the 5' and 3' ends was primarily due to
length heterogeneity, which may be partly as a result of sequencing artifact or potentially
coronaviruses ragged termini (Figure 1B). Owing to high divergence, a stretch of sequence
(~400 nucleotides, numbering corresponds to the complete genome of strain SARS-CoV2/human/USA/VA-DCLS-0285/2020 strain, GenBank Accession Number: MT558705.1)
spanning the start of the ORF1b, which encode for viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP), was targeted to design oligos for the LAMP assay. Additionally, this specific target
genomic locus was adjacent to oligos recommended by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and Public Health England (PHE) for real-time RT-PCR-based routine identification

2.10. Quantitative real time PCR for miR-cel-miR-39-3p RNA
In order to determine the RNA extraction efficiency, the extracted RNA was reverse
transcribed using a commercially available kit (Applied Biosystems/Thermo-Fisher
Scientific, UK) using miR-specific stem-loop primers as per manufacturer instructions. A total
of 5 μL of the sample was added to a 96-well plate together with 10 μL reaction mixture
(MasterMixTM) containing along with MultiscribeTM reverse transcriptase (50 U/μL), and
0.19 μL RNAase inhibitor (20 U/μL). The RT reaction was performed at 16 °C for 30 min,
followed by 42 °C for 30 min, and 85 °C for 5 min and was finally kept at 4 °C. A NTC was
considered in every individually run reaction to identify any unspecific amplification. The RT
products were quantified immediately by qPCR using TaqManTM MicroRNA assays
(Applied Biosystems/Thermo-Fisher Scientific, UK) in a 96 well plate using the 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, UK) as we described before [23]. The
quantification cycle (Cq) was determined with instrument default threshold settings (10 SDs
above the mean fluorescence of the baseline cycle).
2.11. Statistical analysis
A total of 200 sample size was calculated to assess the performance of the LAMP assay.
GraphPad Prism Software version 6.01 for Mac (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California,
USA) was used for graphs generation. The LAMP detection sensitivity and specificity were
calculated using the chi-squared test. TPR (true positive rate), TNR (true negative rate),
FPR (false positive rate), FNR (false negative rate) were calculated according to the
following equations: TPR= TP/(TP+FN). TNR=TN/(FP+TN). FNR=FN/(TP+FN).
FPR=FP/(FP+TN). TP: total number of true positives. TN: total number of true negatives.
TN: total number of true negatives. FN: total number of false negatives.

The conserved region of the RdRP gene with the lowest mutation frequencies was used
as a template to manually design three sets of basic LAMP primers and selected with
PrimerExplorer V5 for appropriate primer lengths, loop selection and melting temperature
optimization (Figure 1C). In order to preclude the non-specific amplification of common
coronaviruses, efforts were made to design primers in the regions where there is a high level
of divergence among more than 3 of the 6 total primers in a specific set. Amongst the most
suitable targets, the primers with high scores were aligned with MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E,
hCoV-OC43, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1 and SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1D). These selected
primers were used for further validation and screening.

3.2. Determination of the limit of detection of the LAMP assay using biochemically
synthesised RNA
In order to assess the robustness of the primers, we used a fully identical in vitro
transcribed target RNA unanimously spanning the length of the RdRP-gene based LAMP
and qRT-PCR target regions. The pre-determined copy numbers of the biochemically
synthesised RNA were 10-fold serially diluted from 107 copies to 0 copies of the target gene
per reaction. To determine the analytical sensitivity of the assays, we first evaluated their
limits of detection (LoD) for both qRT-PCR and LAMP assays. The LoD of the qRT-PCR
was 10 copies as evident from the relative fluorescence units (Figure 2A) and
electrophoreses of the amplified products (Figure 2B). The standard curve generated by the
RdRP-based qRT-PCR was linear and generated a coefficient of correlation (R2) = 0.9481
and a slope of -2.6509 (Figure 2C). Melting curve analysis revealed the specificity of primers
for the target gene sequence, as all the amplified products showed a uniform melting
temperature (Tm) of ~75.10°C and specific amplification patterns (Figure 2B and data not
shown). Compared to the qRT-PCR assay, the LoD for the LAMP which targeted the same
RdRP gene was 1 log unit higher (102 copies/reaction) (Figure 2D, upper panel) as assessed
by visual observation of the LAMP reaction, where positive reactions turned yellow and
negative reactions remained pink when observed by the naked eye. To further confirm the
specific amplification of the target region, the gradient LAMP products were visualized by
DNA staining and gel electrophoresis for the amplified product, further confirming the
detection limit of LAMP (Figure 2D, lower panel).

3.3. Cross-reactivity of the novel LAMP assay when tested against other respiratory and
medically important viruses
The SARS-CoV-2 embraces genetic and phenotypic features of several common cold
coronaviruses and other viruses of the respiratory tract. Owing to high genetic similarity (up
to 96% at nucleotide levels) and common respiratory specimen for clinical identification of
CoVID-19 patients, we aimed to investigate any non-specific amplification in the LAMP
assay. In order to demonstrate the specificity of the LAMP assay, we used pathogens
belonging to 5 families of the most important medical and respiratory viruses. As shown in
the Figure 3A, the qRT-PCR specifically detected only the SARS-CoV-2 and this was
confirmed by Gel-red staining of amplified products (Figure 3B). Consistently, no crossreactivities were observed with the LAMP in both colorimetric detection (Figure 3C, upper
panel) or electrophoreses (Figure 3C, lower panel). Collectively, a highly specific detection
of SARS-CoV-2 was observed for primers set using either of the assays.

3.4. Temporal investigations of the LAMP assay and its impact on the limit of detection
One of the major advantages of LAMP is its robustness. In order to determine the optimal
time required for sufficient amplification of targeted genes, in vitro transcribed RNA was used
as a template in 30 minutes assays and assessed every 5 minutes post-start of the reaction.
The change in colour was monitored visually by the naked eye. As shown in Table 1, under
equivalent conditions similar results were obtained from between 20-30 minutes of
amplification. Therefore, to improve sensitivity and avoid missing any weak positives, 30 min
was selected as the optimal visual interpretation time for the results.
While the change in colour, reflective of a positive reaction, could be detected as early
as 20 minutes post-start of the reaction at lower copy number, subjective variabilities may
result in erroneous interpretation, especially in colorimetric based diagnostic assays. To
propose an automated imaging, processing and interpretation of the LAMP based results,

In vitro transcribed RNA dilution (copies/reaction)

3.5. Manufacture of an isothermal nucleic acid amplification device with colorimetric
detection features
A device (Figure 4A) was built with many off-the-shelf electronic components and
custom flexible resistive heating elements (5W, NEL, UK), and specially designed aluminium
heating blocks. Raspberry Pi (RPi) was used to control the device. The one wire interface of
the RPi was used to connect ten digital temperature sensors (DS18B20, Maxim Integrated,
USA) positioned directly on the PCB boards to monitor heater block temperature changes
and provide feedback control. The specially designed aluminium heater blocks to hold 200
µl PCR tubes and the lid heater to prevent condensation were attached directly on top of the
surface mount temperature sensors on the respective PCBs with a heat transferring
adhesive (TermoGlue, Termopasty Grzegorz Gasowski, Poland). The flexible resistive
heating elements were also attached to the heater blocks. To circumvent the need for
specialised docks and eliminate user interpretation of the colorimetric results, a Raspberry
Pi Camera (RPi Camera) was used. Eight LEDs (LW T733, Osram, Germany) were
assembled on the top side of the lid mount PCB to shine light directly into the reaction tubes
to achieve consistent lighting within the device. All the above components were assembled
into a 3D printed enclosure (14.3 x 10.8 x 6 cm) specially designed with openings to access
to the USB and TCP/IP ports of the RPi. A 20,000 mAh power bank (Anker Power Core,
Anker, China) with two 5V, 2A output was used to power the device. A Python based control
software was used to control the heating, image the progression of the LAMP assay and
store the ‘time-lapse’ images and temperature data within a specified folder. The user can
initiate a test by either connecting to a screen via the HDMI port or through simply pairing
the device with the mobile app via Bluetooth and selecting the required diagnostic assay.
3.6. Automated image acquisition and processing through a template matching-based
algorithm
The LAMP assay (8 separate tubes) was remotely started to initiate heating to 65oC.
Images of those test tubes were captured using the inbuilt RPi Camera for every 20 seconds

and were saved in the RPi in the RGB format. Each individual image (90 images in total)
consisted of 8 frames for each tube with a black background and these were analysed for
30 minutes. As the tube area exposing colour changes was fractionally small compared to
its background, we first extracted each targeted tube frame from the image before applying
an image processing algorithm. In order to process these extracted frames, a reference tube
was selected as a template, and a template matching algorithm [25] was applied to extract
all tubes from the first image. The rationale for the template matching was to search and find
the location of a template image in a larger image. It simply slides the template image over
the input image to perform the 2-dimensional convolution and compared values to get the
maximum overlap to decide the exact similar areas. Assuming that positions of the test-tube
do not change over the time of an experiment, images were cropped in an experiment to
obtain the tube frames from the entire image. These crops are then saved into a 2dimensional array for RGB colour space (see equation below). Once extracted, RGB format
images were converted to YUV format using the following transformation [26] to avoid
diffraction and lighting variabilities in different images.

In YUV colour space, the Y channel represented the luminance of the colour, while the
U and V channels represented the chrominance (Figure 4B). Separating the luminance from
the chrominance reduced the effect of light changing and shadow noises in each tested tube
[27]. Finally, the chrominance (U, V) channels from the YUV image were considered for
image processing. The chrominance (U, V) values of those extracted test tubes were
compared with reference orange test tubes in positive control and reference pink image in
negative control test tubes to calculate the sum of absolute difference (SAD) for each of the
pixel values. After experiments with two images set and fine tuning the threshold values
manually, a SAD threshold value was achieved which provides 100% accuracy in the
separation of COVID-19 positive and negative samples.

3.7. Artificial intelligence-assisted rapid detection of colour changes associated with the
LAMP reaction
Deep learning is a subdomain of AI which doesn’t require any domain knowledge to
work. However, it learns hidden patterns from examples present in the dataset. A deep
learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [28] architecture was proposed with the
bespoke 8 layers deep mode as shown in Figure 4C. It consisted of four convolutional layers
followed by 2 dense and an output layer. Binary cross-entropy was used as a loss function
for optimizing this CNN model.
For the training of the network, the dataset with 360 images was shuffled and then split
into 9:1 proportion (Figure 4D). 90% of the data was used to train the network and the
remaining 10% was exploited to check how the network behaved on seeing a new image.
Training a dataset requires loading numerous images into the memory in a single operation
which is an expensive process. Therefore, a data generator was implemented that read the
data in batches from the dataset directory and fed it to the model. After multiple experiments,
it was observed that the network converged after 6 cycles (epochs) through the dataset.
Therefore, we ran an experiment for only 6 epochs to decrease the probability of overfitting.
In addition, an additional set of 108 test-tube crops was used to validate the network. The
best performing network resulted in an accuracy of 98% in classifying tubes based on their
colours (images with better light).

positive and negative patient samples in addition to known positive and negative controls.
Colour changes were assessed every 5 minutes until the completion of the LAMP reaction
at 30 minutes. Gradual colour changes were detectable with the naked eye as early as 20
minutes post-start of the reaction (Figure 5A). Corresponding samples were run on the newly
developed device and temporal and real-time colour changes were monitored as described
earlier. Depending upon the viral load in the test sample, a clear colour change was detected
and calibrated as early as 20 minutes using device operated processing of the data (Figure
5B). Once the positive test control was identified as positive, the test was be stopped, and
the results were returned, thus reducing the waiting time and power consumption.
As shown in Fig 5B, a template matching algorithm was applied to extract test tubes
from images the CNN model was applied to the extracted tubes to train the model. The CNN
model was used as a machine learning algorithm to identify colours for each image taken
throughout the experiment. Images taken at time tare marked as ‘t’ in the Fig 5B. Once the
positive control test and the negative control test gave the correct results consecutively on
three occasions, the LAMP based test was be stopped, and the results returned. This
approach reduces waiting times for the results and power consumption.
3.8. Validation of ai-LAMP and comparative performance in clinical settings
In order to assess the field application of the optimized assay, we applied the ai-LAMP
to purified RNA spiked with miR-cel-miR-39-3p from CoVID-19 patients. A total of 199 swab
samples were collected from CoVID-19 clinically suspected patients during routine COVID19 screening at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (RLI), University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay
NHS Foundation Trust UK. The extracted RNA from swab samples were run in parallel for
ai-LAMP and two WHO/PHE recommended qRT-PCR targeting the RdRP and N genes of
the SARS-CoV-2. This parallel assessment facilitated the assessment of the comparative
performance of the ai-LAMP.
The RdRP gene-based qRT-PCR detected a total of 67 positives and 132 negatives in
a cohort of 199 patients (Figure 6A). In contrast, a higher number of positive (n=88) and
lower numbers of negative (n=111) were detected by the qPCR which targeted the N gene
(Figure 6B). Interestingly, the ai-LAMP detected a total of 126 positive samples which
constituted several times higher than RdRP and N gene-based qPCR, respectively.
Comparative analysis of these three molecular detection assays revealed 58 total true
positives (TP), 09 false negatives (FN), 64 true negatives (TN), and 68 false positives (FP)
in RdRP-based qRT-PCR compared to RdRP-based LAMP (Figure 6A). Similarly, upon
comparative analysis of the N gene-based qPCR and RdRP-based LAMP, we observed a
total of 74 TP, 14 FN, 59 TN, and 52 FP (Figure 6B).
In the current clinical settings, a qRT-PCR targeting two genes (N and RdRP) was
conducted to conclusively identify CoVID-19 positive cases and this assay is referred as
cumulative (CUM) qRT-PCR. In this scenario, a sample would be considered as positive
only if a Ct value of =/> 35 was detected in both N and RdRP-gene based qRT-PCR. Using
this approach, we noticed a total of a 70 positive and 129 negative samples and an improved
true positive (n=61), false negatives (n=09), true negatives (n=64), and false positives (n=65)
limits (Figure 6C). Taken together, the cumulative comparative picture of the qPCR and aiLAMP has identified a superior detection of positive cases (Figure 6D). In order to confirm
this detection performance, all ai-LAMP amplification products were visualised by
electrophoresis (data not shown), further confirming the aided-detection and improved
implication of ai-LAMP in field conditions.
Next we determined the detection limit of the ai-LAMP in direct correlation with the
standard Ct values of the qPCRs. Plotting of ai-LAMP positive and negative data against the
linearity of the Ct values revealed that ai-LAMP carried Cp (cycle number at detection
threshold) of up to 37 Ct determined by the RdRP gene-based qPCR (Figure 6E and
Supplementary Table 1) or N gene qRT-PCR (Figure 6F and Supplementary Table 1) of the
SARS-CoV-2. This detection was approximately 2 Ct values higher than the detection limit
of the standard qPCR. Analysis of the first 96 samples, run in parallel for the ai-LAMP,
(Figure 6G and Supplementary Table 1) showed a clear demarcation of the positive and
negative samples in the RdRP-gene based ai-LAMP. In order to rule out the quantitative

enhancing the timely and automated detection, and interpretation of the assay results (see
supplementary data).
4. Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 is now a global pandemic, over 216 countries are currently reporting
active infections and the number of daily infections and deaths is continuing to rise,
especially in the Americas and South East Asia through a series of multiphasic spread [29].
Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or registered drugs, leaving timely identification of
CoVID-19 patients, contact tracing and isolation of positive contacts as the most effective
means of containing the pandemic. Among different molecular diagnostic chemistries, LAMP
technology provides a promising approach for the rapid and reliable detection in resourcelimited settings [17]. Recently, the LAMP technology has been widely applied for the
identification of West Nile virus, influenza virus, yellow fever virus, Marburg virus, Ebola
virus, Zika virus, and other myriads of viruses [30- 35]. Here, we demonstrated the
specificity, sensitivity and utility of a novel ai-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 30kb in size with a coding capacity of
9860 amino acids. All of the β-coronaviruses encodes for structural (replicases, S, E, M and
N) genes in the order of 5’ to 3’ in the positive sense genome [5, 36, 37]. A range of qRTPCRs have been proposed and are referred by the World Health Organization [29;
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technicalguidance/laboratory-guidance] for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. While diagnostic assays can
be designed on the most conserved region of the viral genome, most of the routinely applied
RT-PCR and RT-LAMP have been targeting the S, N, RdRP, E and ORF1a/b genes mainly
due to their high level of transcription and abundance in expression compared to other genes
of the SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6, 38]. For the detection of SARS-CoV-2, Chan et al., [23] have
targeted and developed a standard RT-LAMP with LoD of 11.2 RNA copies/reaction using
invitro RNA transcripts. Yan et al., [16] have adapted the ORF1ab to developed RT-LAMP
assay with a detection limit of sensitivities of 2x101 copies per reaction. The majority of these
diagnostic assays carry a high level of sensitivity, specificity and repeatability; however,
these primarily lack the clinical validation and/or optimization on the synthetic targets.
In this study, we have developed and evaluated a novel RT-LAMP in one of the most
conserved genes (i.e. RdRP) within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RT-LAMP was then
directly compared with the currently applied routine diagnostic assays to assess the
comparative performance. The RT-LAMP assay developed in this study, could detect as low
as 100 copies with an in vitro RNA transcript. Importantly, the RT-LAMP has detected the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 68/199 (34%) and 52/199 (26%) additional specimens that were tested
negative by the RdRP-based qRT-PCR and N-based qRT-PCR, respectively. These
findings are interesting, both clinically and epidemiologically due to the high proportion of
asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases of CoVID-19. These apparently healthy people
have been suggested to be a major sources of virus propagation and the basis of epidemics
within the community [39- 41]. Therefore, highly sensitive and specific test is needed to
identify cases with low viral load. The RT-LAMP detected more positive samples which were
otherwise negative by routinely applied qRT-PCR assay. In order to assess the potential
false positive identification, we run electrophoreses and sequencing of the N gene. The use
of a spiked RNA standard that is not expressed in humans (cel-miR-39-3p) helped to confirm
the effective effectiveness of the RNA extraction approach using commercial kits (Qiagen).
In addition, we used a fixed total RNA concentration in all experiments allowing for better
comparisons across groups.

The main challenges of using the colorimetric approach are background which changes
the colour perspective, issues in identifying small changes, bubbles in the test tubes,
relatively small area corresponding to colour change and pixel variation due to camera flash
and background reflections. The CNN based model has used high-performance computer
images to train using these issues and having learned the patterns is able to classify colour,
despite the presence of noise. The trained model has successfully moved to Rpi to identify
colour changes in test tubes. The study produced 98% accuracy for images taken with better
light (Open) and the duration of testing could be dynamically controlled to reduce the length
of operating time and heating with a resulting reduction in energy consumption by the device.
Despite the SAD based approach resulting in 100% accuracy for the images after 30
minutes, this approach failed with other datasets containing bubbles and different
background lights as a different threshold value was produced for each image set.
Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach was utilised in our experiments
to generalize the classification for orange and pink test tubes with different background light
and bubbles.
Collectively, our data showed that the newly established ai-LAMP was highly specific
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from extracted respiratory tract clinical specimens.
The application of this novel LAMP assay may be particularly useful for detecting COVID19 cases with low viral loads and when testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasal or
oral swabs) from patients. Development of ai-LAMP into a multiplex assay which can
simultaneously detect other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens
may further increase its clinical utility in the future.
