Abstract

24

Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more

25

than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its

26

case fatality rate (CFR).

27

Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of

28

dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where

29

T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a

30

T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase

31

(decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T

32

value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values

33

(left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated.

34

Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the

35

CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China

36

was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2

37

weeks.

38

Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still

39

ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have

40

a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.

Introduction

46

An outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei

47

Province, China at the end of 2019.(1) On Feb 11, 2020 the World Health Organization

48

(WHO) announced an official name for the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

49

and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the novel coronavirus as

50

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak of the disease

51

was linked to a live animal market firstly and then was reported person-to-person

52

transmission.(2, 3) The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan City to other areas. As of Mar

53

1, 2020, approximately 80 thousand cases in China alone have been confirmed. Cases also

54

have been reported in more than 25 countries of 5 continents. The case fatality rate (CFR)

55

represents the proportion of people who eventually die from a specified disease. CFR

56

typically is used as a measure of disease severity and is often used for prognosis where

57

comparatively high rates are indicative of relatively poor outcomes (4). It also can be used to

58

compare the effect of treatments among different areas. In general, when a pandemic has

59

ended, CFR can be calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of

60

confirmed cases. A major difficulty in estimating case fatality rate is ensuring the accuracy of

61

the numerator and the denominator. While a pandemic is still ongoing, it is tempting to

62

estimate the case fatality rate by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of

63

confirmed cases reported so far. The resulting number, called naive CFR, however, does not

64

represent the true case fatality rate because this calculation does not account for the delay

65

between case confirmation and disease outcome (5). In that case, the CFR will be

66

underestimated. To estimate the CFR while a pandemic is still ongoing, the denominator

67

should be corrected as cases at T days before, where T is an average time period from case

68

confirmation to death. This study aims to calculate the CFR of the COVID-19 in China by

69

estimating the average time period from case confirmation to death.

70

Methods

71

Data: population level data in this study included daily accumulative numbers of cases

72

and deaths of COVID-19 in China from Jan 21 to Mar 1, 2020. Data was collected from

73

National Health Commission of China, China CDC, and provincial level health authorities.

74

Estimation of T (average time period from case confirmation to death): To calculate CFR,

75

it should be realized that deaths at day X are averagely from cases at day X-T rather than day

76

X. Given a T value, a group of CFRs (daily CFRs) can be obtained from different X days. As

77

known that death number at day X should be less than case number at day X-T (if more than

78

day X-T, CFR would be greater than 100% which is illogical). Based on this point, the range

79

of T can be narrowed. More importantly, no matter what T value is assumed, even it is far

80

away from the true T value, the daily CFRs would converge towards (infinitely approach to

81

but never be over) the true CFR with time (X) increases. The following example will illustrate

82

this principle (Table 1). Assuming CFR = 10%, T = 4 for a disease, the cases number was

83

from 100 to 10000 at day X (X=1 to 100), then the deaths number would be 10 (10, 20 and so

84

on) at day X+4 (5, 6 and so on). When calculating daily CFRs based on case and death

85

numbers with formula deaths (X) divided by cases (X-T), law 1: if assumed T was equal to

86

the true T value (4 in the example), calculated daily CFRs at different day X would constantly

87

be the true CFR (0.1); if assumed T was greater than the true T (5 and 6), daily CFRs would

88

be greater than the true CFR (0.1) and infinitely reduce to near it with the time (X) increased;

89

if assumed T was smaller than the true T (1 to 3), daily CFRs would be smaller than the true

90

CFR and infinitely increase to near it. Besides, it could be found that, law 2: if assumed T was

91

more far away (bigger absolute difference) from the true T, daily CFRs would be more far

92

away from the true CFR and they would need more times to converge towards it. In this

93

example, case numbers were given from 100 to 10000 by 100 increments per day, however,

94

cases growth every day would not be evenly for an infectious disease. Then case numbers in

95

this example were replaced by real case numbers of COVID-19 and the convergence tendency

96

still remained except for individual data points. Based on convergence laws, we used

97

exhaustive method to calculate daily CFRs of COVID-19 by different T values. If an assumed

98

T resulted in relatively constant daily CFRs, and T+1 resulted in decreasing daily CFRs and

99

T-1 in increasing, it could be determined as the true T. The method above could be termed as

100

converged CFR calculation.

A number of T values were selected for screening based on convergence laws. After

105

different T values were tried, as Figure 1 showed, when assumed T was 11, the daily CFRs

106

were decreasing and had no pronounced increase, when it was 0 to 7; the daily CFRs had

107

pronounced increase after early time (T > 11 were not shown due to continuously decreasing

108

trends). CFRs increased as expected according to laws at later stage in some assumed T

109

values (e.g. T=0), but it decreased at early stage which seemed not satisfy the convergence

110

laws. Actually, it was normal. Convergence laws happened due to the force of the true CFR

111

drawing daily CFRs towards its direction by dominating accumulated death numbers. At early

112

stage, the outcome of death had not yet occurred resulting in daily CFRs decreasing with the

113

growth of case number. Thus, T value exploration by convergence laws should depend on

114

period of death growth.

115

Results of Figure 1 indicated the true T should be in the range of 8 to 10. As differences

116

between CFRs were too small at converging stage to compare and scales of y axis in different

127

the daily CFR could converge towards the true CFR though more times needed. If assumed T

128

was equal to the true T value, calculated daily CFRs would keep constant. As Figure 2

129

showed, for T= 11 and 8, comparing with T = 9 and 10, CFRs still had slightly decreasing and

130

increasing trends, respectively. Linear models (blue lines) were generated for analysis of

131

variances and linear trends of theses CFR points in each plot. The slopes of models became

132

flatter and approached towards to 0 when T was from 8 to 9 and 11 to 10. The results

133

indicated the true T should be bigger than 8 and less than 11. When T = 9, the CFRs were

134

almost staying in one line (red dotted line in Figure 2) and slightly increased later. When T =

135

10, though the daily CFRs decreased early but quickly they reached a stable stage. So the true

136

T might be between 9 and 10 days. The mean values of data in plot 9 and 10 of Figure 2 were

137

0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. The true CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province

138

should fall between 0.8% and 0.9%. An assumed T was the closer to the true T value, the

139

earlier daily CFRs converging to the true CFR happened. The mean value of CFRs at later

140

stage of plot 9 or 10 was approximately 0.85%. As shown in Figure 2, if data was analyzed

141

before Feb 20, T = 9 (0.81%) might be determined as the true T value (true CFR). But now

142

the T was postponed to between 9 and 10 days. The reason was not the uncertainty of method,

143

but the long disease course of COVID 19. Time of case confirmation to outcome was longer

144

in some cases than most which caused the true T bigger and CFR slightly increased. For

145

non-Hubei regions, on Feb 20, 6719 of 12644 (53%) cases were in hospitals, but on Mar 1,

146

only 2461 of 13061 (19%) were in hospitals. When a pandemic ended, the naive CFR could

147

be equal to the true CFR. The COVID 19 epidemic in non-Hubei regions is coming to the end

148

(only sporadic cases were reported recently in the non-Hubei regions), so far, the naive CFR

149

was 0.85% (112/13061). The final CFR should not be bigger too much than 0.85%. It

150

indicated calculated CFR by this converged CFR calculation method was a good estimation of

151

the true CFR. More importantly, it could be approximately estimated earlier (3 weeks ago) by

152

our method when a pandemic was still ongoing.

these data points in plots. Red dotted line and number were the estimated true CFR.

158

As shown in Table 2, after Feb 3, death number (350) were more than Jan 21 case

159

number (270), if the T was 12 (Feb 3 minus Jan 1), the CFR would be illogically greater than

160

100%. In another words, death numbers only when before day 12 were less than case number

161

at day 1. So the time T should be less than or equal to 11 days (12-1). The death number when

162

was firstly more than the case number at day 2 was Feb 5 (day 15), so the T should be less

163

than or equal to 12 (14-2). The rest could be done in the same manner. Finally, the smallest T

164

value (T = 11) was selected as the upper limit for convergence screening.

165

Figure 3 was the calculation of daily CFRs with assumed T values (0 to 11). When

166

assumed T was 8 to 11, daily CFRs were continuously decreasing. When T = 0 and 3, there

167

were increase trends at later stage which meant they were smaller than the true T value.

168

Converging stage CFRs data when T = 4 to 7 was selected for plotting with the same y axis

169

scales (Figure 4). As it showed, For T= 4, CFRs had increase trends, and T = 5, the CFRs

170

slightly increased. When T was 7, CFRs decreased and reached stable at later stage. When T

171

was 6, plateau stage appeared earlier than T = 7. The slopes of linear models became flatter

172

and approached towards to 0 when T approaching to 6. Then T = 6 was selected as the true T

173

value for the true CFR calculation. The true CFR of COVID-19 in Hubei calculated by mean

174

value of the daily CFRs of plot 6 in Figure 4 was 5.4%. The estimated T value was smaller

175

than non-Hubei regions. It was not surprising as it seemed that time of case confirmation to

176

death was shorter. Previously in Wuhan City of Hubei Province, many patients had not been

confirmed and reported timely due to overwhelmed medical services and lack of testing kits.

178

The death number (from confirmed and unconfirmed population) could prefer to “select”

179

forward case pools with bigger population. Thus, to obtain an accurate CFR, timeliness of

180

case conformation should not vary too much. The possibility could not be rule out that the

181

CFR might slightly increase later like non-Hubei regions due to the long disease course of

182

COVID 19.

CFR to validate the accuracy of our method. The cumulative cases at day X multiplied

192

calculated CFR should be approximately equal to true death number at day X+T theoretically.

193

As shown in Figure 5-non-Hubei, since Feb 4, calculated death numbers had a good fit to the

194

true death data. The curves came closest to coinciding in shape. For Hubei (Figure 5-Hubei),

195

the predictive curve was similar in shape with true death line, however, from Jan 23 to Feb 10,

196

predicted death numbers were smaller than the true numbers. The predicted curve from Jan 23

197

to Feb 10 seemed be moved to right about 2 or 3 days. A subset data from Jan 21 to Feb 12

198

was selected to recalculate the T, and results in Hubei, T was 2 days. However, it could be

199

found in plot 2 of Figure 3that only 3 points stayed in the stable line before Feb 12. Without

200

later data, it could result in a misleading false CFR. Thus, for CFR calculation, the stable

201

stage of daily CFRs should not be too short.

202

On the other hand, T became bigger indicated the case confirmation was timelier.

203

Outbreak-controllers could indirectly have information about timeliness of case confirmation

204

by monitoring daily CFRs. Stable CFRs trends meant the denominator for CFR calculation,

205

case number, was accurate enough. As extant cases were in quarantine, combining with

206

transmission potential of diseases, it could provide policy-makers information about the risk

207

of second infection, which could help them with evaluation of when people in regions could

208

go back on production. In summary, as death numbers had been almost accurately predicated

209

by calculated true CFR for more than 3 weeks, it could be considered as the true CFR of

210

COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province. For Hubei, calculated death number

211

corresponded with the reported number for more than 2 weeks.

Discussion

216

CFR was calculated by dividing the number of deaths from a specified disease. For a

217

infectious disease, the outcome of death were determined by virulence of causative pathogens,

218

immunity and health status of those infected, medical conditions, received treatment and so

219

on. Whether all infected cases had been completely included into the denominator also

220

affected the CFR. That meant, for the same disease, CFR were not always constant and could

221

vary between populations (6). COVID-19 firstly occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,

222

China and quickly went into a big outbreak and overwhelmed local medical facilities. Then it

223

extended to the whole Hubei Province and other regions in China during the heavy-travel

224

Chinese Spring Festival holidays. The Chinese government rapidly isolated Wuhan and took

225

emergency measure nationwide to prevent and control disease. Non-Hubei regions response

226

to COVID-19 could be regarded as timely. The situations of outbreak in Hubei and non-Hubei

227

regions were quite different. So CFRs were calculated separately. Diagnose and confirmation

228

towards patients presenting with more severe disease had priority in Hubei, especially Wuhan

229

as the limited healthcare-facilities and testing capacities. Thus, the calculated CFR for Hubei

230

was higher due to the underdetection of mild or asymptomatic cases. Other regions in China

231

had token completely epidemical investigation of diagnosed cases under the nationwide strict

232

quarantine and screening policy. Close contactor investigation by CDC could help find mild

233

or asymptomatic cases. Thus, CFR calculated from these regions could be regarded as

234

accurate values in the situation of medical services were not overwhelmed.

235

So far, only a few studies reported CFR of COVID-19. Study of Wuhan's earliest 41

236

cases gave a 15% death rate (7). However, regardless of the sample size, these cases were

237

highly biased towards the more severe cases for CFR calculation. Another study reported the

238

CFR was 4.3% which also had a biased study population (Wuhan hospitalized patients) (8). A

239

newly epidemiological study estimated the CFR was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%) from 4,021

240

cases (9). This study included data from non-Hubei regions, so the CFR should be smaller

241

than that of Wuhan. When epidemic was still ongoing, CFR could be estimated by following a

242

cohort, however, it was time-consuming and difficult to included size-enough and

243

representative patients from unbiased population. Considering the features of daily CFRs

244

convergence, true CFR estimation based on population-level big data might be a good way.

245

In our study, calculated T values were different, T was between 9 and 10 in non-Hubei

246

but was 6 in Hubei. The time in Hubei from confirmation to death was shorter comparing

247

with non-Hubei. On Feb 13, more than 10 thousands cases were reported one day including

248

clinical diagnosed cases without laboratory confirmation. It indicated there would be a lag in

249

case confirmation in Hubei. With the cases in Hubei were confirmed timely, the estimated T

250

might move towards bigger. In addition, when the factors causing the true CFR higher in

251

Hubei were controlled, the true CFR might decrease. The daily CFRs in Figure 3 would also

252

change itself to the new T and CFR. But, 5.4% was the true CFR at the present stage. In our

253

study, 13332 clinical cases were excluded since Feb 13, which might result in an

254

overestimation of the true CFR.

255

CFR calculated in our study was dynamic, which could be used to real-time monitor the

256

case confirmation situation. If daily CFRs kept on a horizontal line and the confirmed cases

257

were continuously decreasing, it meant the control measures had worked well. Not only

258

infectious diseases, but also other diseases which were difficult to follow cohorts can be

259

monitored to calculate the CFR. But a limitation should be taken into consideration that daily

260

CFR would approach to true CFR only when deaths started to appear. When calculated T was

261

too small, it might give outbreak-controllers information that if there remained a lot of

262

infected persons unconfirmed. And if calculated T started to move backwards with time, it

263

meant confirmation of patients had become timely at then.

264

In conclusion, by converged CFR calculation method, the true CFR of COVID-19 in

265

China except Hubei Province was approximately from 0.8% to 0.9%. This calculated CFR

266

could accurately predict the death numbers for more than 3 weeks. The CFR in Huibei was

267

5.4% at the present stage. This method in our study can be used for CFR calculation when a

268

pandemic is still ongoing and monitoring the case confirmation situation.
