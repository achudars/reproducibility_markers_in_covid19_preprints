Abstract: The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan in late 2019 have

11

infected 34,598 people, and killed 723 among them until 8th February 2020. The new

12

virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the

13

traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from

14

1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed

15

multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables

16

to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the

17

contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of

18

local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However,

19

the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus,

20

due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and

21

communities.

Introduction

24

Since the first case of pneumonia named 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

25

being identified in in Wuhan, China, a total of 34,598 confirmed infections were

26

reported in the country until 8th February 2020, which caused 723 deaths (1). Guo et

27

al (2020) have found that 2019-nCoVs was similar with bat coronaviruses (2), which

28

occasionally transmitted to human due to wildlife consumption. Understanding the

29

pattern of transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV is important for effective

preventing and controlling the ongoing pandemic disease. The value of R0 (basic

31

reproduction number) was estimated as 2.2, inferring a median size outbreak (3).

32

However, based on the epidemic transmission model, the number of actual infections

33

would be much larger than the number of confirmed cases (4).

34

At present, tracking the passengers from Wuhan in January 2020 is still the top

35

task for preventing the further spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). To

36

accurately estimate the risk of the novel coronavirus, we compiled the detailed daily

37

traffic data outbound Wuhan from a big-data source, Baidu Map, before the lockdown

38

of Hubei Province, in order to provide information for risk assessment of 2019-nCoV

39

at the province level and the city level (Supp. Fig. 1).

40

Methods

41

The traffic flow data outbound Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January 2020 was

42

downed from Baidu Map Huiyan platform (5). The number of air passengers from

43

Wuhan from 30th December 2019 to 20 January 2020 was released by Aviationtalk (6).

44

The time series data of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases from 10th January to 30 January

45

2020 was obtained from People's daily-Dingxiangyuan (1), which was released by

46

China National Health Commission.

47

We did Spearman correlation analysis for the daily traffic from Wuhan (from 1st

48

January to 26th January) and the total traffic in this period with the number of

49

confirmed cases (from 25th January to 30th January). To explain the variance of

50

confirmed cases in all infected provinces, we developed multiple linear models

51

including population, GDP, population density, and mean temperature as independent

52

variables. All analysis was performed using R (version 3.6.2).

53

Results

54

From 20th December 2019 to 20 January 2020, 854,424 air passengers left

55

Wuhan Tianhe Airport to 49 cities in China (Fig .1). From 1st to 26th January, about

56

three million domestic passengers travelled from Wuhan to other cities. Among the

57

passengers, a few thousands had been confirmed to infected by the novel coronavirus

58

(Fig. 2). The distribution of air passengers from Wuhan to other cities in China had

59

high correlation coefficients (0.71) with the number of confirmed infection cases in

60

those cities on 22nd January. The correlation coefficient drops to 0.56 on 24th January.

61

Then the number of confirmed infection cases was positive correlation with local

62

population size.

63

We used a multiple regression model to explain the variance of the number of

64

cases in the infected cities. After model selection, only two variables remained, the

65

number of passengers and local population (Fig. 3). Overall, the population of the

66

provinces explains near half of the variance in the number of confirmed cases across

67

34 provinces and province-level municipalities, whereas the number of passengers

68

from Wuhan explained around 10% (Fig. 3).

69

Correlation coefficients of number of confirmed that the number of cases in the

70

cities (n=97) from 25th January to 30th January match the number of passengers from

71

Wuhan during the period from 1st January to 26th January. The highest correlation

72

appears on 5th January, inferring a long incubation period up to two weeks (Supp.

73

Table 1).

74

Discussion

75

In the beginning of the spread of the pneumonia, there is a high correlation (0.71)

76

between the number of confirmed infection cases and air passengers from Wuhan,

77

proofed Wuhan the source of the pneumonia (7). As time going, local population

78

played a more dominant role, because the local spread of 2019-nCoV is likely to

79

happen. The basic reproductive number of the infection (ܴ0) to be estimated as 3.8

80

means 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented to stop the outbreak (4).

81

Fortunately, the transmission of the virus was really controlled due to strict prevention

82

measures carried out by Chinese government. Restricted population movements ban

83

was enforced upon 16 cities in Hubei Province since 23rd January 2020 (8), resulting

84

in significant decrease in passengers from Wuhan and adjacent cities, which

85

effectively reduces the spread of the pneumonia. However, 3-5 million people had left

86

Wuhan for numerous cities in China before the province lockdown (Supp. Fig.2), and

87

among them a number of infected people have no clinical symptom yet infectious to

88

others. We believe this is the highest challenge against the current national level

89

antivirus campaign.

90

Currently the first-level response to major public health emergencies has been

91

initiated in 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China on 25th

92

January 2020 (9), so that strict control procedures are carried out to prevent the spread

93

of the virus. According to an infectious disease model, it was estimated that the actual

94

number of infected people in Wuhan on 4th February 2020 may reach 250 thousand

95

(prediction interval, 164,602 to 351,396) without any control (3). Whereas only 5,142

96

confirmed infections were reported in China on 2nd February 2020. Starting from 3rd

97

February, all suspected case in Wuhan will be taken in to medical care, and the virus

98

spread in Wuhan can be controlled gradually.

99

The correlation coefficients between the number of confirmed cases from 26th

100

January to 30th January and number of passengers from Wuhan were higher than that

101

on 25th January (Supp. Table 1). We think the reason is that the confirmed cases on

102

25th is too low due to lack of virus detection kit. After 25th January the supply of virus

103

detection kit was enough and the number of confirmed cases reflect the real situation,

104

which have very high correlation with the number of passengers from Wuhan to these

105

cities during 1st January to 26th January. We notice the highest correlation appear on

106

5th January, two to three weeks ahead of the confirmed cases in those cities

107

(confirmation also needs several days to complete at that time), which infers the long

108

latent period of 2019-nCoV.

109

Combining the two variables (local population and passengers from Wuhan) to

110

interpret the virus outbreak risk, we recommend that the preventing and controlling

111

measures can be divided into two different stages. In the early stage, checking the

112

passengers from Wuhan is more important. Some cities (e.g., Wenzhou in Zhejiang

113

Province) with a large number of returnees from Wuhan have many cases even when

114

they are far from Wuhan in space. The database of travel routes of confirmed patients

115

has been developed and published for free use (10), in order to tracking and warning

116

close contactors. In the late stage, local population become the most important factor

117

in predicting the number of confirmed infection cases. This suggests us that the

118

densely populated metropolitan areas, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and

119

Shenzhen should pay special attentions to preventing the second-generation infections.

120

Moreover, the densely populated rural areas around Wuhan may face double threats of

121

the spread of infectious people from Wuhan and a large number of local susceptible

122

people. These areas, including areas of Hubei Province except for Wuhan, and

123

surrounding area of Henan (Nanyang, Xinyang) and Chongqing, need to prepare for a

124

surge in infection. The rural medical facilities in these areas are scarcer than in cities,

125

clustering cases are more likely to happen in these places.
