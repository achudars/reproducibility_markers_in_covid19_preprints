Abstract: Background: Pregnant and postpartum women face unique challenges during the
COVID-19 pandemic that may put them at elevated risk of mental health problems. However, few
large-scale and no cross-national studies have been conducted to date that investigate modifiable
pandemic-related behavioral or cognitive factors that may influence mental health in this vulnerable
group. This international study sought to identify and measure the associations between pandemicrelated information seeking, worries, and prevention behaviors on perinatal mental health during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Findings: An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of
pregnant and postpartum women was conducted in 64 countries between May 26 2020 and June 13
2020. The survey, available in twelve languages, was hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID19 studies (https://corona.pregistry.com), and advertised predominantly in social media channels
and online parenting forums. Participants completed measures on demographic characteristics,
COVID-19 exposure and worries, media exposure, COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and mental
health symptoms including posttraumatic stress symptoms via the IES-6, anxiety/depression via the
PHQ-4, and loneliness via the UCLA-3. Of the 6,894 participants, substantial proportions of women
scored at or above the cut-offs for elevated posttraumatic stress (2,979 [43%]), anxiety/depression
(2,138 [31%], and loneliness (3,691 [53%]). Information seeking from any source (e.g., social
media, news, talking to others) five or more times per day was associated with more than twice the
odds of elevated posttraumatic stress and anxiety/depression, in adjusted models. A large majority
of women (86%) reported being somewhat or very worried about COVID-19. The most
commonly reported worries were related to pregnancy and delivery, including family being
unable to visit after delivery (59%), the baby contracting COVID-19 (59%), lack of a support
person during delivery (55%), and COVID-19 causing changes to the delivery plan (41%).
Greater worries related to children (i.e. inadequate childcare, their infection risk) and missing
medical appointments were associated with significantly higher odds of posttraumatic stress,
anxiety/depression and loneliness. Engaging in hygiene-related COVID-19 prevention behaviors
(face mask-wearing, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces) were not related to mental health
symptoms or loneliness. Conclusions: Clinically significant posttraumatic stress,
anxiety/depression, and loneliness are highly prevalent in pregnant and postpartum women across
64 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive information seeking and worries related to
children and medical care are associated with clinically significant symptoms, whereas engaging in
hygiene-related preventive measures were not. In addition to screening and monitoring mental
health symptoms, reinforcing healthy information seeking, addressing worries about access to
medical care and the well-being of their children, and strategies to target loneliness (e.g., online
support groups) should be part of intervention efforts for perinatal women. Public and mental health
interventions need to explicitly address the impact of COVID-19 on both physical and mental health
in perinatal women, as prevention of viral exposure itself does not mitigate the mental health impact
of the pandemic.

Introduction
The United Nations Children's Fund estimates that there will be 116 million births in the nine
months since COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO)
on March 11 2020 [1, 2]. The unique challenges facing pregnant and postpartum women that have
been studied during this time include concerns about increased severity of COVID-19 in this
population, potential vertical transmission from an infected mother to her newborn, and increased risk
of adverse neonatal outcomes [3, 4]. Recent studies also suggest elevated rates of mental health
problems among perinatal women during the pandemic including depression [5-10], anxiety [5-13],
dissociation [5], and posttraumatic stress symptoms [5, 13], as well as loneliness and isolation [14].
Research also indicates that perinatal women who have a history of psychological disorders, are
experiencing higher concerns regarding their family’s health, their baby’s future and society due to
the COVID-19 pandemic [15]. Meanwhile, obstetricians report that perinatal women are contacting
them expressing concern about hospital visits, protection methods, their infant’s safety, anxieties due
to social media and fears of contracting COVID-19 [16]. Perinatal mental health problems not only
adversely impact women’s own health, but also infant outcomes [17], mother-infant bonding, and
later infant physical and behavioral health outcomes [18-20]. Thus, the mental health of pregnant and
postpartum women is critical for both their own well-being and that of future generations.
To date, there have been no large-scale cross-national studies of women’s perinatal mental
health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, previous studies have not assessed loneliness as a
mental health experience in this vulnerable group, despite the well-established importance of social
connection during the perinatal period [21] and known adverse effects of loneliness on mental health,
morbidity and mortality [22]. Recent work has also examined only a narrow range of behavioral and
cognitive factors associated with mental health outcomes in this vulnerable group. In terms of
cognitive factors such as worries and concerns, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered the
perinatal experience as healthcare services broadly shift from in person to online and as support
persons are restricted at appointments and delivery. In addition to the concerns about one’s own risk
of contracting COVID-19, pregnant or postpartum women are faced with the possible effects of
infection on the developing fetus or infant. Economic uncertainty coupled with increased isolation
may also negatively affect maternal mental health. Finally, little is known about pregnant and
postpartum women’s engagement in behaviors aimed at understanding the pandemic (e.g.,
information seeking) and preventing COVID-19 infection, and how such behaviors may or may not
be associated with their mental health.
We conducted a survey of pregnant and postpartum women to first examine the relation of
type and amount of information seeking via various channels (social media, news, discussion with
others) to women’s mental health and loneliness. We then analyzed the role of pandemic-related
worries in mental health and loneliness. Finally, we investigated the association between engaging in
COVID-19 prevention behaviors and mental health and loneliness. The primary goal of the study was
to identify modifiable behavioral and cognitive factors, which if addressed, may reduce mental health
risk and improve well-being among pregnant and postpartum women.
Methods
Study Design and Setting. An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey targeting pregnant and
postpartum women was conducted in 64 countries between May 26 2020 and June 13 2020.
Participation in this study was voluntary. All potential participants were informed about the research
objectives and standards of confidentiality regarding the use of the data. The survey, hosted on the
Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies (https://corona.pregistry.com), was advertised
predominantly in social media channels and online parenting forums. Advertisements and the survey
were available in twelve languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Korean,
Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Urdu) by human translators. sought to obtain at least 100

responses from each of the countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases at the time of
recruitment. Interested participants were invited to follow a link to take the survey. The survey
collected standard demographic data and included questions that addressed topics such as COVID19 exposure and worries, lifestyle changes, media exposure, protective factors, and mental health.
Participants. Women who self-identified as being 18 years or older at the time of the survey and as
currently pregnant or having given birth within the past 6 months were eligible to participate. The
study was classified exempt by the Harvard Longwood Campus Institutional Review Board (HLC
IRB) per the regulations found at 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2) on the basis that it poses no greater than
minimal risk and that the recorded information cannot readily identify the subject (directly or
indirectly). The total number of participants at the close of enrollment was 7,562 individuals across
64 countries.
Measures
COVID-19 Assessments
COVID-19 Exposure. Questions assessing whether participants were tested, diagnosed, or in contact
with an individual who had COVID-19 were adapted for this study based on those formulated by the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the Household Pulse Survey[23].
COVID-19 Information Seeking. Participants were asked about the frequency (never, <1x/day, 24x/day, 5-8x/day, 9-16x/day, and >16x/day) of their interactions with various sources of information,
including the news, social media, and interpersonal discussions about COVID-19 using a measure
modified from other published studies [24, 25]. For analyses, interactions were categorized as never,
<1x/day, 2-4x/day, 5+x/day.
COVID-19 Worries. Participants were asked to rate their overall level of worry about COVID-19
on a Likert Scale ranging from 1 for “not worried at all” to 4 for “very worried” [26]. They were then
asked to endorse fifteen specific worries on a list developed for this study. Exploratory factor analyses
were conducted to identify domains within the questionnaire, with oblimin rotation on a tetrachoric
correlation matrix due to the binary nature of the variables. Details of the factor analyses are presented
in the supplementary materials (S2 Text). Worries were categorized into the following domains:
social (parents/grandparents unable to visit, family unable to visit, not able to have a baby shower,
not able to attend a funeral), COVID-19 infection-related (participant or partner will bring infection
home, family or friends will get COVID-19), child-related (no adequate childcare, other children will
get COVID-19), delivery-related (partner not present during delivery, changes to delivery plan,
unborn baby will get COVID-19, not able to breastfeed), economic (significantly affect economic
situation/finances), and missing doctor appointments.
COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Participants were asked to endorse seventeen behaviors they had
engaged in to protect themselves from COVID-19 from a list developed for this study based on WHO
recommendations and media reports. Behaviors were classified into the following categories:
hygiene-related (mask-wearing, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces), physical distancing (avoiding
public places, restaurants and other people, canceling personal engagements, work or school and
working at home), canceling travel (for work or pleasure), stockpiling essential resources (food or
water, hand sanitizer, medication), postponing medical care, and prayer.

Mental Health Outcomes
Depression and Anxiety was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) [27, 28], a
four-item inventory rated on a four-point Likert-type scale. Items are drawn from the first two items
of the 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 scale' (GAD–7) and the 'Patient Health Questionnaire-8'
(PHQ-8). The overall PHQ-4 score is a sum of the four items (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 =
more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day). A PHQ-4 score of >=6 is considered clinically
significant.
Posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed via a modified version of the Impact of Events Scale
- 6 (IES-6). Participants were asked to report how bothered they were by each symptom from 0 (Not
at all) to 4 (Extremely) over the past seven days. The symptom statements were modified to assess
impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The scale is scored by calculating the mean of the five
items used in this study, with the original IES-6 cutoff score of 1.75 yielding 0.88 sensitivity and 0.85
specificity for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis [29-31].
Loneliness was evaluated using the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3) [32]. Participants
are asked how often they experience the following: feeling that they lack companionship, feeling left
out, and feeling isolated from others. Questions were framed so that participants described their
feelings since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses are rated as 1 (Hardly Ever), 2 (Some
of the Time), or 3 (Often), with the overall score as the sum of the three responses. A score of 3 is
considered low, 4-5 medium, and >= 6 high. High loneliness has been associated with poorer mental
and physical health over the life course [33].
Sociodemographic factors and potential confounders. Standard socio-demographic measures were
collected including age, education (categorized as never attended school, elementary school, some
high school, high school graduate or general equivalency diploma (GED), some college/university,
college diploma or university degree, master’s degree, professional degree, doctoral degree), selfidentified race/ethnicity (categorized as White/Caucasian, Latina/Hispanic, Asian, South Asian,
Black, Middle Eastern, Native Hawaiian or Other, Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska
Native, Other/Multiracial), employment status (healthcare worker in a hospital or clinic, worked in a
nursing home, essential/key worker (as defined by the government), none of these, don’t know),
medical coverage status, marital status (married, living with partner, divorced, separated, single,
widowed), weeks pregnant/postpartum (first trimester 0 to <13 weeks, second trimester 13 to <28
weeks, third trimester 28+ weeks, postpartum). Participants indicated their country of residence which
was classified by region for analytic purposes.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics for socio-demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure variables, mental
health, and loneliness were calculated by perinatal stage, classified as first, second, or third trimester,
or post-partum, for all participants. A series of multivariable logistic regressions were then run to test
the study hypotheses. For these analyses, PHQ-4, IES-6 and UCLA-3 outcomes were specified as
binary dependent variables using recommended cutoffs. The first set of models included pregnancy
stage, socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 exposure as independent variables. The second
set of models examined the type and amount of information seeking about COVID-19 as independent
variables. The third and fourth set of models focused on COVID-19 worries and COVID-19 behaviors
as independent variables. Models for information seeking, COVID-19 worries, and COVID-19
behaviors were adjusted for age, level of education, race, survey region, marital status, and pregnancy
stage.
Models were estimated using the GLM function in the R statistical program, version 3.6.2. Due to
the number of models run, interpretations are focused on effects that met the threshold of p< .001.
Due to low levels of missingness (667 [9%]) a complete case analysis was conducted. The raw data
used for the study are publicly available.

Demographic characteristics are reported in Table 1. The mean age of the respondents was
31.3 (SD: 4.8) years. The largest proportion of respondents reported being from South or Latin
America (29%), with Europe a close second (24%), followed by North America (18%), Asia &
Pacific (17%), Africa (10%), and the Middle East (2%). The majority of women identified their
race as White (46%) or Latin/Hispanic (21%) with fewer women identifying as Asian (13%) or
Black (8%) and the remaining women identifying as South Asian (12%), Middle Eastern (1%),
Native/Indigenous (<0%), more than one race (4%) or other/not specified (3%) with a small
number of women missing race information but who answered all other questions (1%). The
majority of women reported being married (65%), being at least a college graduate (73%), not
being an essential or healthcare worker (75%), and having health care coverage (71%). With
regard to COVID-19 exposure, the vast majority of women reported not having been tested for
COVID-19 (89%), not having been in contact with an individual who has or had COVID-19 (78%),
never having been diagnosed with COVID-19 (98%), and not being an essential or healthcare
worker (75%).
Mental health and loneliness. Substantial proportions of women scored at or above the risk cutoffs for IES-6 (2,979 [43%]), PHQ-4 (2,138 [31%]), and UCLA-3 (3,691 [54%]). Fig 2 presents
the proportions of women in our sample at or above clinical risk cut-offs for elevated PTSD,
anxiety and depression compared with other studies of pregnant and postpartum women from
meta-analysis and during COVID-19 as well as the US population modified from that presented
by Lebel et al [7].

Results for multivariable models of socio-demographic and COVID-19 exposure variables in
relation to IES-6, PHQ4 and UCLA-3 are presented in the supplementary materials (see Table A
in S1 Text). In fully adjusted models, only age was consistently associated with reduced risk of
clinically significant outcomes across measures at p<.001. Only “maybe” having been in contact
with someone with COVID-19 compared to “never” was consistently associated with increased
risk of clinically significant outcomes across measures at p<.001.
Information Seeking and Mental Health. Table 2 presents the results of multivariable logistic
regression models for specific types of information seeking in relation to IES-6, PHQ4 and UCLA3.

times per day had more than twice the odds of meeting the clinical threshold for the IES- 6 and
PHQ-4 (Table 2) compared to those who did not engage in that type of information seeking. There
was also a dose-response relation between number of types of information seeking 5+ times a day
and meeting the clinical threshold on the IES-6 and PHQ-4, with individuals seeking information
via multiple sources showing more than twice the odds of distress.
Information seeking was less strongly and consistently related to meeting the risk threshold on the
UCLA-3. Checking news, social media, and mass communications increased the odds of
loneliness between 38 to 48% (Table 2) for women doing so 5+ times a day compared to women
who engaged in information seeking less than once a day. Discussing with others was only
associated with increased loneliness when done 2-4x per day.
Worries and Mental Health. The prevalence of reported COVID-19 related worries is presented
in Fig 3 and Table B in S1 Text. A high percentage of respondents (86%) reported being
somewhat or very worried about COVID-19, with many of the most commonly reported worries
related to pregnancy and delivery including: family being unable to visit after delivery (59%),
the baby contracting COVID-19 (59%), lack of a support person during delivery (55%), and
COVID-19 causing changes to the delivery plan (41%). Being very worried about COVID-19,
compared to not having any worries, was strongly and significantly associated with meeting the
clinical cut-off both on the IES-6 (OR=4.75, 95% CI: 3.34, 6.87) and the PHQ-4 (OR=1.51, 95%
CI: 1.09, 2.13) but was not associated with the UCLA-3 (OR=1.25, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.72), in fully
adjusted models.

Using domains obtained from the factor analysis (see S2 Text), Table 3 presents the association
between mental health outcomes and the six COVID-19 worry categories. Child-related worries
and medical care worries were each associated with significantly higher odds of exceeding the
clinical threshold on the IES-6, PHQ4 and UCLA-3. Social worries were only associated with
higher odds of loneliness. Economic worries were associated with increased odds of meeting the
clinical threshold for IES-6 and PHQ4; infection and delivery worries were only significantly
associated with increased odds of meeting the clinical threshold on the IES-6. The prevalence of

Behaviors and Mental Health. The prevalence of reported engagement in COVID-19 prevention
related behaviors is presented in Fig 5 and further details are provided in Table C in S1 Text. The
majority of women engaged in COVID-19 prevention behaviors recommended by public health
experts: 93% washed/sanitized hands several times per day, 85% wore a face mask, 83% avoided
crowds, 70% avoided eating in restaurants, 67% avoided contact with high-risk people, 64%
disinfected surfaces, and 55% canceled or postponed activities. This pattern of engagement was
largely consistent across pregnancy stage. Results of logistic regression models for IES-6, PHQ-4
and UCLA-3 in relation to types of COVID-19 prevention behaviors are presented in Table 4.

Hygiene and travel behaviors were not related to clinically elevated IES-6, PHQ-4, or UCLA-3.
However, distancing and stockpiling behaviors as well as canceling doctor’s appointments and

Discussion
In this large-scale anonymous, online, international cross-sectional survey of pregnant
and postpartum women from 64 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of
clinically elevated mental health symptoms were high, with 43%, 31%, and 54% of women
exceeding clinical risk thresholds for PTSD, depression/anxiety, and loneliness, respectively.
Excessive pandemic-related information seeking was the strongest correlate of adverse mental
health outcomes. Across any modality or type of media, information seeking five or more times
per day, was associated with a more than two-fold increased risk of clinical elevations in
posttraumatic stress and depression/anxiety. Moreover, there was no evidence that discussion
about COVID-19, whether with another person or in social media, reduced loneliness. The vast
majority of women in our study reported feeling somewhat to very worried about COVID-19, with
large proportions reporting pregnancy or birth specific worries such as lack of social support
around delivery. Child-related worries (inadequate childcare, other children will get COVID-19)
and worries about missing doctor appointments were independently associated with increased odds
of clinical elevations in all outcomes. Most women reported following public health science
supported COVID-19 hygiene behaviors (e.g., face mask wearing, washing hands). Such behaviors
were not associated with adverse mental health symptoms or loneliness.
Prevalence rates of psychiatric distress in our study exceed non-pandemic perinatal
studies of prenatal and postpartum depression and anxiety [18, 19] and most general population
estimates during pandemics [37]. Findings are especially notable as a very small proportion of
women report COVID-19 infection and most women (> 75%) also reported that they were not
exposed to anyone with a known infection. Recent commentaries highlight that women may be
particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic’s effects and public health measures taken
to reduce its effects, e.g., may be more likely to lose employment due to child care demands given
school closures [38]. These considerations may be particularly salient for pregnant and postpartum
women, for whom pandemic associated worries and the physical distancing required for infection
control may exacerbate mental health problems and feelings of loneliness. Given the potential
implications for maternal and child health, acknowledging the pandemic’s unique impact on
pregnant and postpartum women is central to tailoring and scaling public and mental health
intervention efforts to address their particular needs.
Our findings on information seeking are consistent with others that have found high
levels of pandemic-related information-seeking, whether social media or traditional news
sources, is associated with increased prevalence of anxiety and depression [24, 25]. Our results
extend these findings to perinatal women and expand the modalities examined. Strikingly, we
found that even discussing COVID-19 with another person five or more times a day was
associated with a two-fold increase in posttraumatic stress and depression/anxiety. Discussing
COVID-19, whether with another person or in mass communications (e.g. Facebook, Twitter)
was not associated with reduced loneliness. In fact, there was evidence of higher loneliness in
persons who engaged in such discussions frequently, suggesting that interpersonal engagement
with others, while generally beneficial for mental health, may not be protective if strongly
focused on the pandemic itself.
Degree of worry about COVID-19 was associated with clinically elevated symptoms of
posttraumatic stress and depression/anxiety but not loneliness. With regard to specific worries,
child-related worries and missing medical appointments were consistently associated elevations
in posttraumatic stress, depression/anxiety and loneliness. At the time of this study, we
identified only one other study of pregnant or postpartum women that reported on specific

worries [39]. Our findings, based on a data-driven approach to identify worry domains, were
consistent with those reported by Corbett et al., who found that a majority of women had worries
about the health of their relatives, children, and the unborn baby. Additionally, our results show
that substantial proportions of women also have worries related to their delivery plan, with
specific concerns about not being allowed a support person during delivery. Providing women
with up-to-date, accurate information on how to prevent infection of themselves and their
children, helping women understand the steps healthcare systems are taking to prevent
infections of patients, especially newborns, and providing consistent prenatal and postpartum
care may help support pregnant women’s mental health during this time.
With respect to behaviors to safeguard against the pandemic, most women reported
engaging in prevention efforts recommended by public health experts i.e. hand hygiene, wearing
a face mask, avoiding crowds and public places such as restaurants, avoiding contact with highrisk individuals, and disinfecting surfaces. Most notably, hygiene-promoting behaviors were not
associated with clinically significant mental disorder symptoms or loneliness. While hygiene
promotion behaviors are central to containing the viral spread and mitigating risk, engaging in
such behaviors (or not) are unrelated to mental health. This has important implications for clinical
research and intervention efforts as it suggests that different interventions may be needed to
address the infectious disease aspects of the pandemic versus the mental health and emotional
well-being aspects. Associations between other pandemic-related prevention behaviors and mental
health and loneliness were inconsistent.
Our study findings should be interpreted in light of some limitations. The cross-sectional
nature of the study prevents any causal attributions between the factors we examined. For instance,
distancing behaviors and postponing medical care to prevent the contraction of COVID-19 (but
not changes to travel plans and hygiene behaviors) were associated with clinically significant
posttraumatic stress. Women who experience elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms may be
more likely to isolate themselves; social avoidance is part of the syndrome. Social distancing
efforts may also perpetuate or exacerbate posttraumatic stress [40]. Additionally, our study
findings are based on a convenience sample and thus not-representative of any country or region.
Women in our study are likely those more active on social media platforms, which was our primary
modality of recruitment. Accordingly, our study likely also does not represent a comprehensive
range of concerns and mental health needs of pregnant or postpartum women, such as those with
limited internet access. However, given the large sample size, the availability of the survey in
multiple languages, and the paucity of perinatal mental health data for women during the COVID19 pandemic, our study provides initial information for future research and intervention efforts.
Conclusion
Pregnant and postpartum women are reporting clinically significant depression, anxiety,
and posttraumatic stress, which are higher than most available general population estimates of
psychiatric distress during the pandemic. Such high levels of mental health problems have
potential implications for women, and fetal and child health and development. Thus, efforts to
screen, monitor, and target a range of mental health symptoms, and other aspects of emotional
well-being, such as feeling of loneliness and worries, and coping behaviors (e.g., appropriate
information seeking) should be considered. Reinforcing the importance of appropriate
information seeking should be a key consideration in intervention efforts. Future studies may
also consider examining women’s specific concerns and worries related to child well-being and
concerns about access to medical care. Finally, public and mental health interventions need to
explicitly address both the viral disease risks as well as the mental health risks associated with the
