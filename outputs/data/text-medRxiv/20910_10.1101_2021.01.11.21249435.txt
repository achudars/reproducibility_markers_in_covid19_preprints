Abstract
Background
Regional monitoring of the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local
management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys.
Methods
We developed a method to reconstruct in real-time the proportion infected by SARS-CoV-2 and
the proportion of infections being detected from the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence,
hospitalisation and case data. We applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions.
Findings
We estimate that 5.7% [5.1%-6.4%] of adults in metropolitan France had been infected by SARSCoV-2 by May 2020. This proportion remained stable until August and increased to 12.6% [11.2%14.3%] by the end of November. With 23.8% [21.2%-26.8%] infected in the Paris region compared
to 4.0% [3.5% - 4.6%] in Brittany, regional variations remained large (Coefficient of Variation CV:
0.53) although less so than in May (CV: 0.74). The proportion infected was twice higher (17.6%
[13.4%-22.7%]) in 20-49 y.o. than in 50+ y.o (8.0% [5.7% - 11.5%]). Forty percent [33.7% - 45.4%]
of infections in adults were detected in June-August compared to 55.7% [48.7% - 63.1%] in
September-November. Our method correctly predicted seroprevalence in 11 regions in which only
hospitalisation data were used.
Interpretation
In the absence of contemporary serosurvey, our real-time monitoring indicates that the proportion
infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be above 20% in some French regions.

Introduction
Less than a year after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and a first pandemic wave that has had
devastating consequences, most European countries are now confronted with an intense second
wave of SARS-CoV-2. In this context, the availability of up-to-date estimates of the proportion of
the population that has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might potentially be immune in the
different regions of a country is of critical importance to inform the local management of the
epidemic. This information will become ever more important as the epidemic progresses and
spatial heterogeneities in population immunity may keep on growing.
In many European countries, serological studies have provided estimates of the proportion of the
population infected during the first pandemic wave. For example, it was estimated that about 45% of the population in metropolitan France had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by
May 2020, with seroprevalences of the order of 10% in Grand Est and Ile-de-France, the two most
affected regions (1–3). Since then, the virus has kept on circulating. Unfortunately, we lack
contemporary estimates of seroprevalence that could capture the more recent regional evolution
of the epidemic. This largely stems from the difficulty and cost to implement large-scale
nationwide representative serosurveys at regular intervals. In this context, it is critical to develop
methods that can track the proportion of the population that has been infected in the different
regions from the joint analysis of existing seroprevalence data and other surveillance data that
are more readily available in real time. Such monitoring is difficult to perform from the analysis of
case data since testing practices changed substantially over time and space. Joint analysis of
serological and death data across different countries has been used to reconstruct the proportion
of infected individuals and allowed extrapolation to countries where serology was not available
(4,5). However, such an approach may have difficulties to capture spread in younger age groups
given low infection fatality ratios in these groups and may provide lagged estimates given the
relatively long delays between infection and death.
Here, we present a method to reconstruct the proportion of the population infected by SARS-CoV2 and the proportion of infections detected by surveillance from the joint analysis of age-stratified
seroprevalence, hospitalisation and case data. The method is applied to metropolitan France and
makes it possible to track in real time underlying SARS-CoV-2 infections by region and age group.

Methods
Estimation of age-specific infection hospitalisation ratio
Estimates of age-stratified infection hospitalisation ratios (IHR, i.e. the proportion of infected
individuals in an age group that require hospitalisation) are derived from the joint analysis of
hospitalisation and serological data documenting the impact of the first pandemic wave in Ile-deFrance and Grand Est, the two regions of metropolitan France that were most affected. This
calculation has been described elsewhere (6). In short, seroprevalence estimates were obtained
from the SAPRIS study (1) gathering data from the large population-based French cohorts
Constances, E3N-E4N, and NutriNet-Santé and the numbers of hospital admissions were

obtained from the SI-VIC database, the national exhaustive inpatient surveillance system used
during the pandemic. Since the median date of sample collection in the serosurvey was May 14,
the IHR were obtained by dividing the cumulative numbers of hospital admissions up to May 6 (to
account for estimated 11- and 19- day delays from infection to hospitalisation and seroconversion,
respectively (7,8)) by the number of infected people estimated from the serosurvey. Patients from
nursing homes, who were not part of the cohort target population, were excluded from the
calculation.
Sensitivity and specificity of the serological tests
Multiple imputation was used to infer the probability of infection among participants. In all
participants, an EuroImmun IgG test against the S1 domain of the spike protein (Elisa-S1) was
performed. When the Elisa-S1 optical density ratio was ≥0.7, two further tests (EuroImmun IgG
test against Nucleocapsid protein and an in-house microneutralization assay to detect neutralizing
anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies) were performed. We assumed that participants with at least one
positive test but no negative test were truly infected. Among the participants assumed truly
infected, 82% (278/338) had three positive tests, 15% (52/338) had two positive tests and 2%
(8/338) had one positive test.
Since the specificity was higher than 95% for each test independently (it was 100% for the
neutralization assay (9)), the likelihood of two or three false positive tests in uninfected individuals
could be considered negligible and the likelihood of one false positive test in uninfected individuals
was very low and concerned very few participants. We therefore assumed the specificity to be
100%.
However, in this imputation model, an Elisa-S1 < 0.7 was sufficient to be classified as non-infected
which may have been biased by the imperfect sensitivity of this serological method. We calculated
the sensitivity of Elisa-S1 at this threshold (0.7) in participants with positive RT-PCR result in the
cohort. We found that 91 participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR less than 3 months
before the serological test, among whom 76 had an Elisa-S1 ≥0.7, suggesting a sensitivity of the
Elisa-S1 test at this threshold of 84% [75% - 90%]. This value was in line with the sensitivity
reported at a threshold of 0.8 in an evaluation performed in SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ confirmed plasma
donors (90.4% [84.4% - 94.7%] (10). We accounted for the imperfect sensitivity of the serological
tests in the IHR. In our baseline scenario, we assumed the sensitivity of the test was 85% and
considered 80%, 90% and 100% in sensitivity analyses.
Reconstruction of the dynamics of infection
The curve of the daily number of infections was reconstructed from the daily number of hospital
admissions and the distribution of the delay from infection to hospitalisation. For each age group,
the number of infections was obtained as the deconvolution of the hospitalisation and the
infection-to-hospitalisation delay distribution and divided by the IHR. The time-to-hospitalisation
delay is discrete and parameterized with a gamma distribution with a mean of 11 days and
standard deviation (sd) of 3.2 days. The deconvolution approach used a Richardson-Lucy scheme
(11) that was adapted to account for right censoring in the hospitalisation curve (appendix p 1).

The number of infections was reconstructed for all 13 regions of metropolitan France. Hospitalised
individuals with missing age represented 0.7% of total hospitalisations (n=1480) and were not
included in the study.
External validation
The proportion of infected adults on May 11 was compared to the results of a national
seroprevalence study (3) that was conducted in 12 regions of metropolitan France among those
aged 15 y.o and over in May 2020.
Estimation of the proportion of infections detected by surveillance
Dates of infections of confirmed cases were reconstructed with the same deconvolution approach
using the national virological surveillance data (SI-DEP) and assuming the infection-to-detection
delay has a gamma distribution of mean 8 days and sd 2.8 days, which accounts for an incubation
period of 5.5 days (12) and a delay of 2.5 days to testing and reporting. Proportions of infections
detected by surveillance were estimated over two periods (June-August and SeptemberNovember), and were estimated as the ratio of the cumulative number of infections of cases over
the cumulative number of infections obtained from the hospitalisations.
Simulation study
We studied the accuracy of the deconvolution method at reconstructing the daily number of
infections on simulated curves. Four infection curves were simulated to study various
epidemiological scenarios (a gaussian epidemic, an increasing exponential, a decreasing
exponential, a curve reconstructed from the hospitalisations in France between 1 September and
22 November). All but the first curve were right-censored.
The simulated curves of hospitalisations were then obtained by convolution with the infection-tohospitalisation delay distribution and the daily infections were obtained using the Richardson-Lucy
approach of (11) and our method. Comparison of the input and reconstructed infection curves are
shown in appendix p 3.

Results
Figure 1 presents the estimates of the seroprevalence (Figure 1A), the number of hospitalisations
per 100,000 inhabitants (Figure 1B) and the IHR (Figure 1C) in the different age groups, in Ile-deFrance and Grand Est. The seroprevalence was higher among the 40-49 y.o. (14% [12% - 17%])
and lower among the 70-89 y.o. (4% [3% - 7%]). The cumulative number of hospitalisations per
100,000 inhabitants and the IHR increased with age. The IHR increased from 0.46% [0.30% 0.72%] in 20-29 y.o. to 21% [13% - 33%] in 70-89 y.o. Figure 1D shows the dynamics of
hospitalisations by age group.
Our model is calibrated to serological data collected in two regions in May but can be used to
reconstruct the seroprevalence and proportion infected in all regions and over time (Figure 2AD). Consistent with national seroprevalence from our dataset for external validation (3), we
estimate that 4.8% [4.3% - 5.4%] of adults were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 in May 2020 in

metropolitan France. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence in May are also consistent with
those measured at the time, even in the 11 regions where only hospitalisation data informed our
inference (Figure 2A). After correcting for the imperfect sensitivity of the serological assay, we
find that 5.7% [5.1% - 6.4%] of the adult population had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 by May
2020 in metropolitan France (Figure 2B), with important regional variations (Figure 2C). The
proportion infected remained stable during the summer 2020 and increased in September to
reach 12.6% [11.2% - 14.3%] on November 30 (appendix p 4). On that date, the proportion
infected was highest in Ile-de-France, Paris region (23.8% [21.2% - 26.8%]), followed by
Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (16.5% [14.4% - 18.9%]), Grand Est (15.1% [13.4% - 17.2%]),
Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (13.2% [11.6% - 15.0%]) and Hauts-de-France (12.4% [10.9% - 14.1%])
(Figure 2D). We find that the proportion infected is more homogeneous across regions in
November than in May (coefficient of variation of 0.53 in November as opposed to 0.74 in May).
The proportion infected was highest in those aged 20-49 years old (17.6% [13.4%-22.7%])
compared to 8.0 % [5.7% - 11.5%] in those aged 50+ y.o. (Figure 2E and appendix p 5). The
same pattern by age was seen in most regions (Figure 3A), with the risk of infection in those aged
20-49 y.o. being 2-3 times higher than that in those aged 50+ y.o., depending on the region (Figure
3B).
We estimate that 53.6% [46.9% - 60.8%] of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the adult population were
detected by surveillance between June and November 2020, with a probability of detection of
39.5% [33.7% - 45.4%] in June-August and 55.7% [48.7% - 63.1%] in September-November (pvalue <0.001) (Figure 4 and appendix p 6). The probability of detection was higher in those aged
>50 y.o. (68.6% [55.2% - 82.4%]) than in those aged 20-49 y.o (46.4% [38.8% - 54.2%]; p-value
= 0.004) (Figure 4). These estimates are consistent with a simple analysis of the raw data:
between June 1 and November 30, 120,000 adults were hospitalised and 1,800,000 cases were
detected by surveillance, leading to a proportion detected of about 50% for an average estimated
IHR of 3.3%.
In our baseline scenario, we assumed that the sensitivity of the serological test was 85%. In a
sensitivity analysis, we find that estimates of the proportion infected by November 30 increased
from 10.7% [9.5% - 12.2%] for a sensitivity of 100% to 13.4% [11.9% - 15.2%] for a sensitivity of
80% (Figure 5A) (p-value = 0.006). The proportion of infections that were detected varied from
50.4% [44.2% - 57.2%] for 80% sensitivity to 63.1% [55.2% - 71.6%] for 100% sensitivity (Figure
5B).

Discussion
We presented a method to reconstruct the proportion of the population infected by SARS-CoV-2
by region and age group from the joint analysis of readily available hospital surveillance data and
existing serological surveys. The approach offers a simple way to track in real-time the number
of infections in the population, which is challenging in the absence of regular, large-scale and
representative serosurveys.
After accounting for the imperfect sensitivity of serology, we estimate that the proportion infected
by SARS-CoV-2 in metropolitan France doubled from about 6% in May 2020 to about 13% at the

end of November 2020, suggesting the two waves have relatively similar sizes. There are
however important differences. First, the first wave occurred over a much shorter time period than
the second wave that is still ongoing (Figure 2). Second, while the first wave was mostly
concentrated in two regions, all regions were impacted by the second wave. As a consequence,
the proportion infected was more homogeneous in November than in May 2020. However,
substantial heterogeneities remain. For example, the proportion infected in Ile-de-France (Paris
area) was about twice the national average. Overall, relatively similar patterns of infection by age
were reconstructed in the different regions, with individuals aged 20-49 y.o. being at substantially
higher risk (Figure 3B).
Assuming that those infected are immunized against reinfection, 24% immunity could contribute
to slowing down the spread of the virus in Ile-de-France. Consider for example a situation in which
control measures are such that, in a naive population, a case infects on average R0=1.6 persons.
In such a scenario, we would expect the number of cases to double about every 10 days. With
20% immunity, the effective reproduction number would be reduced to Reff=0.8x1.6=1.3 leading
to a substantially higher doubling time of about 18 days. However, given the very high
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of control measures (R0=3 (8)), 20% immunity
would be insufficient to avoid a major sanitary crisis if all control measures were to be lifted.
Indeed, in such a scenario, the effective reproduction number would be Reff=0.8x3=2.4, with the
number of cases expected to double about every 5 days.
For the period between June and August 2020, we estimated that 39.5% [33.7% - 45.4%] of
infections were detected, which is consistent with another modelling study (13) which reported a
detection rate of 38% [35% - 44%] at the end of June. In our baseline scenario, we assumed a
sensitivity of 85% for our assay, consistent with existing estimates (14). Higher sensitivities would
lead to slightly lower estimates of the proportion infected and would inflate the proportion of
infections being detected by surveillance at surprisingly high levels in some age groups (Figure
5).
Our estimates rely on the assumption that age-specific IHRs remained constant over time and
across regions. However, it is possible that IHRs changed during the course of the pandemic, for
example as a function of the stress on the healthcare system. Such variations could affect our
estimates. For example, in a sensitivity analysis, we show that a 10-20% reduction in the IHR
during the second wave would have limited impact on estimates of the proportion infected overall
(13.3% [11.8% - 15.1%] for a 10% reduction and 14.1% [12.5% - 16.0%] for 20% reduction)
(appendix p 3) but would reduce the proportion of infections being detected to 48.9% [42.8% 55.4%] for 10% reduction in the IHR and to 44.0% [38.5% - 49.9%] for a 20% reduction) (appendix
p 3). Our IHR estimates are calculated during the first pandemic wave and therefore constitute
averages over a time period during which the stress on the healthcare system changed rapidly.
IHRs may also vary with regional hospitalisation policies. For example, if there is higher propensity
to hospitalize young adults in some regions, we might overestimate the proportion of infected in
this age group and therefore in the overall population. However, while IHRs may vary by regions
and with the stress on the healthcare system, we note that we were able to correctly predict the
seroprevalence in the 13 regions of metropolitan France (Figure 2A) even though we only used
IHRs estimates for Ile-de-France and Grand Est, the two regions that were the most affected

during the first wave. Since our framework relies on the analysis of hospitalisation data and
children have a very small probability of hospitalisation, our approach would likely generate large
confidence intervals for that age group. We therefore decided to focus on adults.
Our approach makes it possible to estimate the number of persons that have been infected by
SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic. It is believed that most persons infected by SARSCoV-2 will acquire at least short term protection against reinfection (15). However, the duration of
protection acquired through natural infection remains poorly characterized (16). In a scenario
where there is waning of immunity and in the absence of vaccines, the estimated number of
persons infected by SARS-CoV-2 will be an upper bound of the number of persons that are
protected against infection. The interpretation of contemporary seroprevalence estimates may be
equally challenging since it is unclear whether antibody decay following infection indicates a loss
of protection. Therefore, in the long run, in the absence of vaccines, the proportion protected
against SARS-CoV-2 may fall between the proportion seropositive estimated from
seroprevalence studies and the proportion infected estimated with an approach such as the one
presented here. Obviously, as vaccination campaigns are starting around the world, it will be
essential to track the level of immunity acquired through vaccination.
We presented a simple framework to track the proportion infected in real-time from the joint
analysis of age-stratified hospitalisation and serological data. Our approach should be easy to
apply to other countries in which hospital surveillance and results of serosurveys are available.
