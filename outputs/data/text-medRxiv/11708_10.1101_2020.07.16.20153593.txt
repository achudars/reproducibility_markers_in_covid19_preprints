Abstract
Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an
unprecedented impact on healthcare delivery. This international qualitative study captured the
global impact on vascular patient care during the first pandemic ‘wave’.
Methods: An online structured survey was used to collect regular unit-level data regarding
the modification to a wide range of vascular services and treatment pathways on a global
scale.
Results: The survey commenced on 23rd March 2020 worldwide. Over six weeks, 249
vascular units took part in 53 countries (465 individual responses). Overall, 65% of units
stopped carotid surgery for anyone except patients with crescendo symptoms or offered
surgery on a case-by-case basis, 25% only intervened for symptomatic aortic aneurysms
cancelling all ‘elective’ repairs. For patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease
60% of units moved to an endovascular-first strategy. For patients who had previously
undergone endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, 31.8% of units stopped all postoperative
surveillance. Of those units regularly engaging in multidisciplinary team meetings, 59.5% of
units stopped regular meetings and 39.1% had not replaced them. Further, 20% of units did
not have formal personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines in place and 25% reported
insufficient PPE availability.
Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on vascular services
worldwide. There will be a significant vascular disease burden awaiting screening and
intervention after the pandemic.

Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound effect on the availability of
surgical resources1.
Vascular services have been severely affected by these challenges. Some vascular societies
have issued guidance on what operative case-mix should be undertaken during the
pandemic2-4. These include adapting service provision for elective and urgent vascular
presentations such as stroke and aortic aneurysm. However, the exact impact of the pandemic
is still unknown5.
The Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) is an established vascular
research collaborative6-9, which responded rapidly to the pandemic by delivering the
COVID-19 Vascular SERvice (COVER) study, an international prospective mixedmethodology project. The aim of the first part of the COVER study described here (Tier 1), is
to document fluctuations in vascular services globally during the first phase of the pandemic.

Methods
International guidelines on designing and reporting of surveys were used10. The study
protocol is available online (https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.27.20114322v1;
ISRCTN: 80453162).
A remote digital survey was developed by a global team of vascular healthcare-professionals.
Questions related to all aspects of vascular care, including staff availability, multidisciplinary
team input, and personal protective equipment (PPE) (Appendix B). Results reported here
are for the period 23rd March 2020 - 3rd May 2020, divided into three two-week periods for
comparison. Duplicate responses were removed.
International/continental comparisons were performed, where possible, to describe relative
change in practice. A score of 0 to 3 was allocated to each answer based on perceived relative
service reduction by 12 VERN healthcare-professionals (‘0’ representing no change,‘3’
representing most significant change; Appendix C).

Results
Overall, 465 completed survey responses were collected from 249 different units in 53
countries across six continents (Appendix D). Figure 1 shows all unit responses together with
overall service reductions and worldwide response. Individual countries’ reduction in service
measures are available in Appendix C.
Carotid surgery
Globally, 17.7% of units only offered intervention to patients with crescendo transient
ischaemic attacks, 43.5% continued to offer surgery on a ‘case by case’ basis and 36.4%
made no changes to their carotid practice.
Aortic screening programmes
Of those units offering aortic aneurysm screening services, 45.8% stopped all screening
activities; 18% continued a reduced programme and 10% continued screening as usual.
Aortic pathologies
Thresholds for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair were raised in the majority of
centres; 11.7% of vascular units limited surgery to >6.5cm in maximal diameter, 16.4% to
those >7cm, 25.1% to symptomatic or ruptured AAA and 2.3% to AAA suitable for
endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) only. Despite this, 25.1% reported no change in practice.
Access to EVAR out of hours was initially available to 10% of responding units, increasing
to 20% in the following four weeks. Overall, only 14.2% of units maintained a 24/7 EVAR
service, 26.3% maintained an ‘in hours’ service, 31.5% offered EVAR for urgent cases only
and 18.5% were able to run their service on an ad hoc basis only. Post-EVAR surveillance
continued as normal in 24.6% of units. However, 35.2% had reduced availability and 31.8%
stopped it completely. The majority of units (56.6%) maintained their pathways for acute
aortic syndromes (type B aortic dissection, penetrating aortic ulcer and intramural

haematoma). A small proportion (5.9%) moved to conservative management only, whilst
4.5% were offering early endovascular surgery and 26.6% limited surgery to ruptures.
Lower limb
Changes to the management of lower limb pathologies are shown in table 1 for each twoweek period. The majority of units began offering a greater proportion of their patients major
amputation or palliation rather than attempting revascularisation for chronic limb-threatening
ischaemia, with many moving to an endovascular-first treatment strategy.
Outpatient clinics
Whilst 27.5% of units moved to a triage clinic system, 29.0% cancelled all planned outpatient
clinics. Use of technology permitted 14.9% of units to move to video or telephone clinics,
with 18.7% including subsequent triage for attendance if required (18.7%). The use of ‘hot’
clinics (reserved for acute/urgent patients) increased during the pandemic; 79.1% of units
reported using some form of hot clinic to accommodate vascular patients.
Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings
Overall, 32.2% of units who normally participated in an MDT continued with face to face
meetings; 59.5% stopped regular face to face meetings, and of those, 39.1% did not replace
them. Overall, 36.8% moved to remote conferencing.
Staff redeployment
Globally, 5.5% of senior surgeons were redeployed to support other specialties, compared to
53.5% of junior vascular surgical staff redeployed from the vascular team to other specialties.
Personal Protective Equipment
The majority (80.5%) of units had PPE guidance in place; 25% did not have access to
adequate PPE at the start compared to 18% at the end of this period.

Discussion
The COVER study is the first international prospective study of unit-level vascular surgical
practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from Tier 1 suggest radical changes in
practice in a range of services.
One notable change across participating vascular units is the reduction in AAA screening
activity. The benefit of AAA screening, and likelihood of finding a new AAA (<1.5%)11 must
be balanced against the risk of COVID-19 transmission and allocation or resources. Given
that the majority of units have reported higher size thresholds for AAA intervention, the
chances of finding AAA large enough to be considered for repair at this time even lower. UK
National AAA Screening Programme data suggest that 809 threshold AAAs are identified
annually (2018)12, which implies that there will be a UK backlog of approximately 130
AAAs relating to this 6-week study period, with resource implications post-pandemic. This
will be replicated to some degree worldwide.
Another very common finding is the reported preference for endovascular strategies to
address aortic and peripheral arterial disease; this is thought to be based on a drive to
minimise hospital stay and reduce demand on intensive care beds13,14. For EVAR, a paradigm
has been created where potentially more EVAR is performed during the pandemic, but with a
reduction in post-EVAR surveillance. There are important implications relating to the
financial resources, operating time and staffing that will be required to catch up with missed
scans and scheduled operations as services begin to resume. Vascular patients will be
competing with the estimated 28 million operations cancelled or postponed during the
pandemic peak15. For lower limb pathology, the results of an increased endovascular
approach on limb-related outcomes will also be important to follow.

recommendations that potentially go against our usual surgical inclinations2-4. Anecdotally,
patients who may have received active treatment pre-pandemic were being palliated due to
the perceived high risk of intervention, especially if they tested positive for COVID-19.
Strategies have moved towards endovascular management where open surgery would have
been the surgeon’s usual preference. Replacing a face-to-face MDT with virtual meetings has
facilitated ongoing access to MDT support for such complex decision making during this
challenging period.
Study limitations
Despite the large number of units taking part, correlating individual country or regional data
with dates of lockdown is challenging. Dates of lockdown were, however, similar for
countries providing the majority of responses (UK, Germany, USA). All participating units
entered lockdown in March 2020, and were in lockdown when the survey began.

As the COVER study continues, we anticipate the widening of practice in the immediate
future. If there are any subsequent COVID-19 ‘waves’ in areas that are ‘past the peak’, or in
locations where the pandemic peak has yet to occur, this data will support vascular surgeons
when deciding on how to adapt practice once again. The impact of cancellations has been
modelled for general surgical procedures and predicts a large number of excess deaths16. It
will be important for vascular surgery to have similar data available in the same way.

Study Design and methodology:
An online survey (SurveyMonkey®) was developed by the COVER study team, with
vascular surgeons at junior and senior levels from the USA, UK, Australia and Singapore, to
provide clear language and questions that were applicable to global practice assessment.
The survey was piloted amongst the stakeholders in the first instance to ensure language and
questions were clear and appropriate.

In the first fortnight, closed and open questions were used enabling each centre to provide
free-text for feedback based on the local challenges. The questions related to centres’
provision of common vascular services, imaging, screening, staff availability, theatre suite
availability, multi-disciplinary team input, clinics and PPE. After one week, a preliminary
review of responses to open questions (marked as ‘other’) was used to provide more closed
questions, suitable for the global participants, and to support longitudinal data comparison.
Centres were asked, through regular repeated advertisement via social media, e-newsletters,
and established international collaborative networks, to complete the survey regularly (at
least weekly).
Data cleaning
The raw survey data was carefully scrutinised and cleaned prior to analysis. Duplicate
responses (defined as responses from the same unit on the same day), and responses which
contained no usable data (e.g. where the responder had entered no more than the name and/or
size of the unit without answering any of the questions about service provision) were
removed. There were a number of responses where the respondent had selected ‘other’ but
then typed a free-text response which corresponded with one of the pre-specified options.
These options were allocated to specific answers so that they could be counted along with the

other options. These were almost exclusively responses made in the first week after the
survey went live, before the number of pre-specified options was increased.

Appendix C:
International/continental comparison analysis
We performed international/continental comparisons, to describe relative change in practice
from normal. This was achieved by allocating a score of 0/1/2/3 to each possible answer for
each service evaluation question. A score was allocated based on the perceived relative
service reduction (with ‘0’ representing no change and ‘3’ representing the most significant
change). For example, for the question: “have you changed your operative practice for
elective AAA survey?” the answer ‘no change to practice’ automatically scored 0, whereas
the answer ‘limiting surgery to >7cm asymptomatic AAA’, a significant change, could be
scored 1/2/3. A score for each survey question answer was independently provided by 12
COVER team members (all vascular specialists). The mean value from these responses was
then used to quantify the overall change in vascular service provision for each responding
unit. Centre responses were then plotted with smoothing splines used to fit the trend in the
average response, and Jackknife residuals used to generate approximate 95% confidence
intervals for the change in average responses over time (where there was an apparent change
in responses over time). Generalised cross-validation was used to automatically choose
optimal smoothing parameters.

The scores given to each answer are shown below. ‘*’ indicates responses for which a prespecified score was mandated.
AAA = abdominal aortic aneurysm, CCU = coronary care unit, CLTI = chronic limb
threatening ischemia, HDU = high dependency unit, ITU = intensive care unit, MDT =
multidisciplinary team, ST.DEV = standard deviation, TEVAR = thoracic endovascular
aortic repair, TIA = transient ischemic attack.
