Abstract
Background: Currently, effective vaccines or specific therapeutic agents against COVID-19
are not available. However, in China, traditional Chinese herbal medicines have provided
therapeutic benefit to patients with COVID-19. Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG) is a
Chinese multi-herbal formula previously developed for the treatment of H1N1 influenza and
has been encouraged for patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 during medical
observation. However, the immunological mechanism for the efficacy of JHQGG has not
been confirmed.
Objectives: We thus examined whether the administration of JHQGG affects hematological
and immunological measures in healthy individuals.
Method: We enrolled 18 healthy volunteers, all of whom tested negative for antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2. Peripheral blood samples were collected 1 h after oral administration of
JHQGG and subjected to hematological, biochemical, and cytokine tests.
Results: JHQGG rapidly induced a significant decrease in the plasma level of IL-6 and an
increase in the plasma level of IFN-γ.
Conclusions: Our finding suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of JHQGG against COVID19 is, in part, associated with its rapid immunomodulatory activity.

Introduction
There have been no specific vaccines or drugs proven to be clinically effective against
COVID-19. However, in China, the majority of COVID-19 patients have been treated with a
combination of traditional Chinese and modern Western medicine [1–3]. The use of several
Chinese herbal formulas is encouraged for the treatment of COVID-19 in the latest version of
the diagnosis and treatment protocol released by the National Health Commission of China.
One of them is Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), which was formulated specifically for the
symptoms of H1N1 influenza [4]. Previous preclinical studies showed that JHQGG reduces
pulmonary lesions and mortality in mice infected with the H1N1 influenza virus [4]. A
clinical study also demonstrated that JHQGG reduces the duration of fever and alleviates
respiratory symptoms of patients with H1N1 influenza [4].
On the basis of its therapeutic efficacy for influenza, JHQGG has been recommended for
patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 during medical observation. In a randomized
controlled trial using mild cases in Wuhan, combined administration of JHQGG with Western
medicine significantly ameliorated respiratory symptoms and relieved psychological anxiety
compared with the administration of Western medicine alone [5–7]. However, the
pharmacological mechanism underlying the efficacy of JHQGG has not been confirmed. We
thus examined whether JHQGG administration affects hematological and immunological
measures in healthy individuals.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
This is an open-label, single-arm study to obtain a clue to the pharmacological action of
JHQGG. We enrolled a total of 18 healthy volunteers (5 males, 13 females; ages 22–58 years;
mean age [SD], 33.8 [10.7] years), all of whom tested negative for IgM and IgG antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2. Individuals were excluded if they had current infectious, inflammatory, or
immune-related diseases.
Administration of JHQGG
JHQGG was kindly provided by Hugh Wang, Juxiechang (Beijing) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
The subjects were instructed to take a packet (5 g) orally 40 min after lunch. This dose is
known to be effective for the treatment of influenza [8]. Peripheral blood samples were
obtained 1 h after the administration.
Hematological, biochemical and cytokine analyses
Hematological and biochemical tests were outsourced to SRL, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Plasma

cytokines were quantified using V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Human Kit (Meso Scale
Diagnostics) and Human IL-18 ELISA Kit (Abcam). All collected data (n = 18) were
subjected to the statistical analysis using a two-tailed paired t-test.

Results
Hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume changed marginally within the normal ranges
(Table 1), but there were no significant differences in other measures of complete blood count
and blood biochemistry between pre- and post-administration. Notably, in blood cytokine
analysis, the plasma levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ were significantly decreased and increased,
respectively, compared with those in pre-administration (IL-6, 2.75 vs. 1.63, 95% CI: -1.90 to
-0.326, P = 0.00837; IFN-γ, 6.20 vs. 7.17, 95% CI: 0.193–1.73, P = 0.0172). The plasma IL-6
was decreased in 14 (77.8%) out of 18 subjects, whereas the plasma IFN-γ was increased in
13 (72.2%) out of 18 subjects (Fig. 1). We also found a relatively large decrease in the IL-18
level; however, the difference was not statistically significant (266 vs. 193, 95% CI: -154–
7.69, P = 0.0732).

Discussion
Dysregulated cytokine production is a hallmark of patients with COVID-19. Elevated blood
levels of IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α have been
observed especially in severe cases [9–12]. In particular, IL-6 plays pivotal roles in the
exacerbation of COVID-19. Evidence is accumulating that an aberrant increase in IL-6 leads
to complex immune dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The blood IL-6 level is
positively correlated with the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients [13–15].
IFN-γ is a central mediator of antiviral immunity with an ability to directly interfere with
viral replication. In addition, IFN-γ is indirectly involved in viral clearance through
potentiating the action of IFN-α/β, activating Th1–dependent immune responses, and
enhancing the MHC class I pathway [16]. Compared to healthy individuals, COVID-19
patients have significantly lower numbers of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells with reduced
capacity to produce IFN-γ, which causes the slightly decreased expression of IFN-γ [10,17].
Notably, the reduced cytotoxic potential of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells is IL-6–dependent
[17] and severe COVID-19 cases have a higher IL-6/IFN-γ ratio than moderate cases [18].
In conclusion, JHQGG can down- and up-regulate the plasma levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ,
respectively, immediately after oral administration. The rapid immunomodulatory effects of
JHQGG may be able to remedy the immune dysregulation observed in COVID-19 patients
