Abstract

19

Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices emerged as a critical component to controlling

20

and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 131 semi-structured phone

21

interviews with households in rural Odisha, India to understand behavior changes made in

22

WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices.

23

Interviews were conducted from May-July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of

children less than five years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in

25

villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of

26

respondents (86%, N=104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19 or

27

the related government lockdown, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency,

28

more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices

29

remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new

30

consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit

31

formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also

32

detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors including village-level cleaning of water tanks

33

and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17%

34

of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal

35

change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic. We

36

provide detailed thematic summaries of qualitative responses to allow for richer insights into

37

these WASH behavior changes, or lack thereof, during the pandemic. The results also highlight

38

the importance of ensuring communities have adequate WASH infrastructure to enable the

39

practice of safe behaviors and strengthen resilience during a large-scale health crisis.

41

Background

42

COVID-19 rapidly spread across the world and was declared a global pandemic by the World

43

Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.1 As of January 2021, the WHO reports the

44

disease has already caused over 2 million deaths globally. 2 COVID-19 is caused by the novel

45

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is transmitted person-to-person primarily through inhalation of

46

respiratory droplets/aerosols and contact with fomites contaminated with the virus from an

47

infected individual.3 Many preventative measures have been promoted to reduce the spread of

48

the disease, with particular emphasis on avoiding large crowds and social distancing from others,

49

wearing a face mask around others, frequent handwashing with soap, and avoiding touching

50

one’s face.4 To quickly limit the spread of the virus, many countries also implemented

51

lockdowns to restrict movement and limit commercial activities. However, access to household

52

water and sanitation facilities can influence the ability of households to adequately practice many

53

of the preventative measures promoted, including frequent handwashing and staying home when

54

infection is suspected or during strict lockdowns.

55
56

Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in feces of infected individuals, leading

57

to the possibility that fecal-oral transmission could also play a role in virus transmission,

58

particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with high rates of open defecation,

59

ineffective fecal sludge management, and poor access to safe drinking water. 5 An additional

60

factor that could suggest potential foodborne and waterborne transmission is the report of

61

diarrheal symptoms in some individuals infected with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 may have

62

higher stability and longer survival times in diarrheal stools, which could increase risk of

63

environmental transmission along potential fecal-oral routes. 6,7 Although little evidence is

64

available and this is an active area of research, there is no evidence of confirmed transmission of

65

SARS-CoV-2 through food or waterborne routes to date. However, the WHO highlighted the

66

importance of safe management of human feces and treatment of drinking water as precautions

67

against COVID-19 in their interim guidance related to WASH and COVID-19. 8 The lidless

68

design of squatting pans of flush toilets in many LMICs, including India, is another factor that

69

could potentially lead to a risk of transmission via virus particles becoming aerosolized during

70

flushing and subsequently inhaled or leading to contamination of surfaces. 9 Due to the

71

recognized importance of handwashing to reduce transmission, and possible spread via feces, it

72

is clear WASH access and practices are important for reducing the spread of COVID-19.

73
74

The objective of this research was to understand the WASH-related practices of rural households

75

and communities in Odisha, India in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated WASH

76

behavior changes made as a result of COVID-19 and challenges faced that could affect

77

participant’s ability to comply with recommended WASH preventative measures. We used a mix

78

of qualitative and quantitative questions in phone interviews to capture participants’ experiences

79

at a time when COVID-19 was rapidly spreading throughout Odisha, India. The knowledge from

80

this research can help inform WASH-related guidelines for controlling COVID-19 and improve

81

community resilience to external shocks increasingly faced by marginalized populations.

82
83

Methods

84

Study site and sampling frame

85

We conducted semi-structured phone interviews with head of households (HOH), caregivers of

86

children less than 5 years old, and Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC) members in

87

Ganjam and Gajapati districts of rural Odisha, India. Interviews were completed between May-

88

July 2020 when there were lockdowns in both districts, including restrictions on travel and

89

commercial activities which changed over time based on local case counts. 10 During this time,

90

there was also an influx of migrants workers returning to Odisha, which was accompanied by a

91

surge in local COVID-19 cases and Ganjam district becoming a hotspot of cases within Odisha. 11

92

Massive awareness campaigns to educate the public on COVID-19 and encourage preventive

93

measures such as social distancing, mask wearing, and hand hygiene were also underway, with

94

messaging spread through a variety of ways including television, radio, social media, and

95

women’s self-help and other community groups.12,13 Details about participants’ knowledge of

96

COVID-19 and impacts on daily life have been previously reported. 11 We specifically targeted

97

HOHs to understand household-level impacts, caregivers to understand childcare practices

98

including child feces management (CFM), and VWSC members to understand village-level

99

response and changes to village’s piped water system.

100
101

All included villages had previously participated in a village-level WASH infrastructure

102

intervention known as MANTRA (Movement and Action Network for Transformation in Rural

103

Areas), that was implemented by the NGO Gram Vikas. This intervention included village-level

104

mobilization for all households to construct a latrine with attached bathing room, and

105

construction of a community piped water system that was connected to households after village-

106

wide latrine construction was completed.14 The villages are also currently enrolled in a CFM

107

intervention trial (ISRCTN15831099), but the intervention had not yet started at the time of this

108

study.

109
110

Interview tool

111

A semi-structured interview tool that included a mix of structured and open-ended questions was

112

developed for each respondent type and has been previously published. 11 All respondents were

113

asked questions about changes in handwashing, drinking water, sanitation, and household

114

cleaning practices as a result of the pandemic. Respondents were also asked about any challenges

115

they faced with water availability, or challenges in being able to frequently wash their hands with

116

soap. The VWSC interview tool also included questions about changes to village piped water

117

distribution services. Lastly, the caregiver interview tool included specific questions on the

118

impact of the pandemic on CFM practices.

119
120

Data collection

121

Interviews were conducted by a team of three research assistants, who were all fluent in the local

122

language Odia and originally from Ganjam district. The team underwent a multi-day remote

123

training on how to conduct the phone interviews in May 2020, including training on different

124

interview techniques to use for structured versus open-ended questions. The team piloted the

125

interview tool to gain additional training and to ensure proper translation and comprehension of

126

questions before beginning data collection.

127
128

The phone numbers of HOH and caregiver target respondents were randomly ordered using a

129

computer-generated sequence, and research assistants were instructed to contact respondents in

130

the given random order. VWSC members were selected based on village selection. Further

131

details about respondent selection and calling procedures are reported elsewhere. 11

132
133

Data collection occurred over phone calls. When a respondent answered the phone, the research

134

assistants introduced themselves, briefly explained the purpose of the call, and read a consent

135

form, including consent to audio record the conversation. Once the respondent gave their

136

consent, the research assistant continued with the interview questions. During the interview, the

137

research assistant recorded responses and notes in a Microsoft Word version of the interview

138

tool. After the call, research assistants listened to the audio recording to check their transcribed

139

responses and add any details missed. Each interview took approximately 30-45 minutes.

140
141

Data analysis

142

Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for all quantitative analysis

143

of structured survey questions. A modified form of thematic analysis was used for qualitative

144

analysis of open-ended questions and explanations respondents gave about their responses to

145

structured questions. The modified thematic analysis included three rounds of reading through

146

responses to a given question, with memo notes about initial reflections done in the first round,

147

preliminary emergent themes constructed in the second round, and themes finalized in the third

148

round.

149
150

During data quality checks, it was realized that one enumerator had sometimes skipped certain

151

survey questions and fabricated some of the data for a portion of their surveys. However, since

152

interviews were audio recorded, the accuracy of the data was ensured by having the study

153

supervisor listen to each of this enumerator’s interviews and correct the data accordingly prior to

154

analysis. As a result, sample sizes vary slightly among different questions due to some questions

155

being sometimes skipped.

156
157

Ethics

158

Informed consent was verbally obtained over the phone from all participants before interviews

159

began. At the end of the interview, research assistants read a list of helplines participants could

160

call if they needed assistance and also provided information on COVID-19 preventative

Characteristics of study participants

167

In total, 131 participants were interviewed, including 73 heads of household, 21 VWSC

168

members, and 37 caregivers of children <5 years. These respondents spanned 43 villages,

169

including 26 in Ganjam and 17 in Gajapati. Approximately 8% of respondents ended the

170

interviews early, including five HOHs, one VWSC member, and five caregivers. Overall,

171

respondents had high levels of access to household piped water, latrines, and bathing rooms

172

(Table 1). HOH and VWSC participants were predominantly male whereas caregivers were

173

predominantly female (with 88%, 86%, and 8% of each type of respondent being male,

174

respectively).

Handwashing

180

A large majority of respondents (86%, N=104) reported a change in their handwashing due to

181

COVID-19 or the lockdown. Most described positive changes, such as an increase in the

182

frequency of handwashing, an increase in the use of soap and/or sanitizer, or adopting a more

183

thorough handwashing technique. Several respondents also described that they had started using

184

waterless hand sanitizer for the first time and now use it frequently, particularly when they are

185

outside their home. However, not all respondents had changed to a proper handwashing

186

technique. Some respondents reported only using water to wash their hands, sometimes due to

187

the cost of soap (Table 2).

188
189

When describing their increase in handwashing frequency and soap/sanitizer use, many

190

respondents explained that they were now washing their hands very frequently, with several

191

respondents linking handwashing to new daily activities or discussing that it has become a new

192

habit, whereas they previously only washed before eating or not at all:

193
194

“Earlier, we did not use to wash our hands when we used to come from outside. We used

195

to wash our hands only when needed. Now, when we come back from outside or market,

196

we wash our hands and feet before entering the house. We are washing our hands 5-6

197

times a day. If we have to go to some office, we wash our hands. We are using [waterless

198

hand] sanitizers as well. I wash my hands and use the sanitizer afterwards at times. The

199

quantity of soap and water has also been increased.”

200

- Male respondent, 35-39 years old (June 2020)

201
202

“Handwashing has turned out to be a habit. Everyone is doing it. I never used to wash

203

my hands, but after coronavirus, we have been washing them frequently.”

204

- Male respondent, 45-49 years old (July 2020)

205
206

“We are cleaning our hands as said in the TV. Earlier, did we use to wash our hands 20-

207

30 times with soap in a day [like we are doing now]? We used to only wash once or twice

208

[a day] before having food.”

209

- Male respondent, 55-59 years old (May 2020)

210
211

“We did not use to wash our hands earlier, but are now washing them with soap and

212

sanitizer. In every 20-30 minutes, we wash. Who used to wash their hands like this

213

earlier, madam? They used to wash, but only before eating.”

214

- Female caregiver respondent, 25-29 years old (July 2020)

215
216

Some respondents also explained that they had made changes to their handwashing practices to

217

now wash their hands more thoroughly:

219

“Now, after seeing it from the TV, we are washing our hands very frequently from all the

220

sides in a systematic way; from above, below and between the fingers. Earlier we only

221

used to wash one side of the hand palm and that too, not very frequently.”

222

- Male respondent, 65-69 years old (June 2020)

223
224

Caregivers were also asked if the handwashing practices of their young children (<5 years old)

225

had changed as a result of COVID-19 or the lockdown, to which 72% (N=21) reported ‘yes’.

226

Many of the changes in children's handwashing practices mirrored the changes in adult's

227

handwashing, including caregivers washing their young children's hands more frequently or

228

asking older children to wash their own hands more frequently, and starting to use soap or

229

sanitizer to clean children’s hands.

230
231

“The children are made to wash their hands every time. For example, if they are playing

232

inside the home or studying, after that, their hands are washed. Their hands are washed

233

some 10-12 times in a day. We never used to do it earlier, but have started doing it only

234

after coronavirus.”

237

Challenges related to handwashing. Most respondents (87%, N=110) reported no challenges in

238

being able to frequently wash their hands with water and soap. Among the few who experienced

239

challenges (13%, N=17), this mostly related to buying soap (8% of all respondents, N=10) and/or

240

getting water (6% of all respondents, N=8; 3 of these respondents described a challenge with

241

both), with 2 respondents (2%) describing other challenges. The challenge with soap was

242

predominantly cost, with two respondents specifically stating the government had not offered

243

help with buying soap. No one mentioned being unable to find soap at shops. For challenges

244

getting water, this was often due to water scarcity in the summer season or the water source

245

being far away (Table 2).

Qualitative Themes and Descriptions


Increased frequency of handwashing: Among respondents who reported a change, the majority said they were
washing their hands more frequently now due to COVID-19. Some respondents described washing hands very
frequently, such as 20 to 30 times a day or every 30 to 60 minutes. Many explained they are now more conscious
or alert about handwashing and are washing their hands as soon as they get home, after each task, or after touching
objects outside the home, as well as at key times such as before eating. Some respondents discussed how the
pandemic had made handwashing a habit for them. Others specifically said that no one washed their hands before
coronavirus and it was a new practice for them.



Started using any or more soap/sanitizer: Many respondents explained they started using soap or waterless hand
sanitizer due to COVID-19 or reported using more soap or water now. Several respondents also elaborated that this
is their first time using hand sanitizer and they now keep a bottle with them and use it frequently.



Started washing hands more thoroughly: Some respondents explained that they now wash their hands more
thoroughly. This included washing hands for a longer time and washing specific parts of the hands, such as the
fingers and gap between the fingers that they had not previously washed. A few respondents said they had changed
their practices after learning about proper handwashing practices from ASHA and Anganwadi workers and one
respondent explained he had learned the technique for washing his whole hands from television.



No change: Among respondents who reported no change in their handwashing practices, many said this was
because they had always washed their hands with soap and water often.



Improper handwashing: Not all respondents had changed to a proper handwashing technique. Some respondents
reported only using water to wash their hands. For some, this was due to the cost of soap, although not all
respondents explained why they only use water. A few respondents also said they do not wash their hands
frequently because they are not used to it or because they only wash their hands when they remember.



Challenge buying soap (8% of all respondents, N=10): The challenge with soap was predominantly cost, with two
respondents specifically stating the government had not offered help with buying soap. No one mentioned being
unable to find soap at shops.



Challenge getting water (6% of all respondents, N=8): For challenges with water, respondents described problems
discussed in more detail in Table 3 under “Challenges related to household water availability”.



Other challenges (2% of all respondents, N=2): One respondent described how frequent handwashing can
negatively impact your skin and another said that it can be challenging to use soap regularly as it is a new practice.

Water access and treatment

250

At the village level, about half of VWSC members (52%, N=11) reported a change to the piped

251

water supply service in their village as a result of COVID-19. Changes included adding

252

bleaching powder to the water tank for water treatment, cleaning the water tank, and/or

253

extending or reducing the hours of water supply (Table 3). At the household level, 84% of

254

respondents (N=101) reported they had not experienced any reduced water availability due to

255

COVID-19 or the lockdown in the past 7 days. Among the few respondents who reported

256

reduced water availability (16%, N=19), many of the problems described were likely unrelated to

257

COVID-19 (Table 3).

258
259

The majority of respondents 83% (N=98) reported no change in their drinking water practices

260

due to COVID-19. Among the respondents who reported a change (17%, N=20), 19 respondents

261

respondents reported

Qualitative Themes and Descriptions


Added bleaching powder to village water tank (33%, N=7): The most common reported change was that bleaching
powder had been added to the water tank by the VWSC or government officials, either specifically or more
frequently due to COVID-19.



Cleaned village water tank (24%, N=5): The next most common reported change was the water tank being cleaned
by the VWSC or government officials, either specifically or more frequently due to COVID-19. As an example, one
VWSC respondent said they used to clean the tank regularly once every two months, but now increased the cleaning
frequency to once per month due to COVID-19.



Change in water supply service hours (14%, N=3): In two villages, the water supply hours were extended due to
coronavirus. In one of these villages, the VWSC member said they extended the water supply time each day due to
the water needs of people staying at the village quarantine center. In contrast, in another village the water supply
hours were reduced due to its village quarantine center using a lot of water.



No change (48%, N=10): Among the other half of VWSC respondents who reported no change in the piped water
supply service due to coronavirus, four explained they already regularly clean the tank and/or put bleaching powder
in it, and three explained the water is already supplied throughout the entire day. Four villages also mentioned
issues related to water scarcity and the water source for the tank drying up in the summer season.



Started treating their drinking water (16%, N=19): The following changes in drinking water treatment due to COVID19 were reported: 16 respondents started to boil their drinking water, 1 started to both filter and boil their water,
1 treated their household water tank with bleaching powder, and 1 treated their water with a tablet that was given
to them by an ASHA worker. Several respondents that reported no change in their drinking water practices explained
they do not treat their drinking water in any way, although many also reported they have always treated their
drinking water, either by boiling, filtering, or using an Aquaguard purifier attached to their tap.



Changed how they store their drinking water (3%, N=4): Four respondents explained that they either cleaned or
changed their drinking water storage container due to coronavirus. Specifically, one respondent said they cleaned
their water storage containers now, another said they were using a cleaner vessel, one started storing water in clay
pots that were distributed to them, and lastly, one respondent had stopped putting their hands in the water
container when getting water out and were instead using a utensil to retrieve the water.



Reduced water availability due to COVID-19: Only two respondents provided details of water availability problems
specifically related to coronavirus. One respondent used to get water from public taps including one at the school,
but due to the lockdown they can no longer get water from the school tap, making it more difficult for them to

availability in the past 7
days

266

access water. Another respondent explained they are getting less water now because people residing at the village
quarantine center are using water, which has led to fewer hours of piped water supply.


Reduced water availability that may be partially related to COVID-19: Respondents in four different villages
described recent problems with piped water availability. Three of these respondents explained that the motor for
their village’s water tank pump was not functioning and had to be repaired, but it was fixed now. It was not
mentioned whether COVID-19 impacted the ability to fix the pump quickly, but it is possible this was a factor. In
one village the respondent said the motor was not working for 20 days.



Reduced water availability not related to COVID-19: Several respondents explained problems with water
availability that were not related to COVID-19. At least four respondents described water scarcity being a problem
in the summer season, due to water sources drying up, while a couple respondents said the piped water becomes
muddy when it rains. Others mentioned general problems with the water supply system, such as difficulty with the
water connection, problems due to an old pipeline or changes to the water supply system, not getting regular
water, or that water is only supplied for 30 minutes a day.

Sanitation

268

The pandemic and lockdown had no major impact on reported latrine use (Table 4). Almost all

269

respondents (96%, N=109) reported no change in their family’s defecation practices as a result of

270

COVID-19 or the lockdown, and 88% (N=100) reported defecating in the latrine with only 12%

271

(N=14) defecating in the open. Similarly, no caregivers reported a change in their child feces

272

management or latrine training practices due to COVID-19 or the lockdowns, although some

273

described impacts on general childcare practices and/or support (Table 4). Among the few

274

respondents who did report a change of practices in their family, one respondent reported a

275

change in his grandfather’s sanitation practices due to fear of the virus:

276
277

“Whoever does not have the habit of going to the latrine goes outside. It is my

278

grandfather. Now, after coronavirus, he is not going out anymore. He is getting scared.

279

Rest of us have always been using the latrine.”

280

- Male respondent, 25-29 years old (June 2020)

281
282

Respondents were also asked if COVID-19 or the lockdowns had impacted defecation practices

283

within their village. Again, the majority of respondents (77%, N=86) believed there had been no

284

change, 14% (N=16) did not know whether there had been a change, and only 9% (N=10)

285

believed there was more latrine use in their village now. Among those who reported more latrine

286

use and less open defecation in their village now, it was common for respondents to attribute this

287

change to either awareness of coronavirus or because villagers were going out less due to the

288

lockdown:

290

“Half of the people who believe in coronavirus, use the latrine and bathroom. The ones

291

who do not believe in it go to the open.”

292

- Female respondent, 25-29 years old (July 2020)

293
294

“Everyone's latrine is in use since before [coronavirus]. However, the way people used

295

to go outside is not happening anymore. This is not only out of the fear of corona, but

296

also due to lockdown. People also get beaten up if they go out now. [Before the

297

lockdown] when there is a weekly market in another village or town which people attend

298

and feel like defecating at the same time, they have to go out as there is no latrine in the

299

market areas.”

300

- Male respondent, 30-34 years old (July 2020)

301
302

Additionally, although the interview did not include a specific question related to latrine

303

construction, two respondents from households without latrines expressed that COVID-19 or the

304

lockdown had either stopped or made it more difficult for them to construct a household latrine.

305

One respondent described how his family was previously building a latrine, but it had stopped

306

due to COVID-19. Another respondent described how her family wanted to build a latrine but it

307

was now difficult to do so because of the lockdown and low income due to COVID-19.





Small increase in village latrine use: When considering defecation practices in their entire village, only 9% (N=10)
believed there was more latrine use in their village now. Among those who reported more latrine use in their
village, some respondents explained that this change was due to the increased awareness or fear of coronavirus,
whereas others said that villagers are going out less now due to the lockdown. More specifically, a VWSC member
explained when villagers used to leave the village to go somewhere such as marketplaces, they would defecate in
the open due to unavailability of a latrine there. However, since that movement has stopped, that open
defecation has also stopped. Among those that reported no change in village defecation practices (77%, N=86),
many reported that everyone in the village was already using the latrine before coronavirus. For respondents who
said they did not know if there was a change (14%, N=16), these were mostly caregivers who explained that they
do not know other villager’s defecation practices.



No change in household latrine use: Among respondents that reported no change in their family’s latrine use,
most elaborated that all family members always use the latrine (83%, N=91), which was also the case before
COVID-19. Some respondents specifically mentioned they have been using the latrine for a long time. Other
respondents (10%, N=11) reported that they sometimes open defecate and sometimes use the latrine. Some of
these respondents explained that the decision of whether or not to use the latrine was based on time of day (e.g.,
open defecate in the daytime but use the latrine at night due to snakes), water supply (e.g., go for open
defecation when there are problems getting water or water supply has stopped), season (e.g., prefer to use the
latrine during rainy season), or condition of the latrine (e.g., do not use latrine when wall or latrine pan are
broken). A few respondents (5%, N=6) explained that some family members open defecate while others use the
latrine. Out of the four respondents who said they defecated in the open, three did so because they did not have a
latrine while one explained this is a habit he cannot change.



No change in CFM practice due to COVID-19: Only four caregivers (12%) reported a change in where their child
defecates and where they dispose of their child’s feces since the start of the pandemic or lockdowns. However,
none attributed this change to the pandemic, but rather to their child growing and transitioning to new behaviors:
two of the children started walking and hence began learning to use the latrine while the other two children had
started their latrine training and then fully transitioned to latrine use. Although there was no change for
households interviewed, two caregivers thought that child latrine use must be happening more now in their village
as families are doing whatever they can to keep their children healthy and safe from coronavirus.

COVID-19 outbreak and started defecating in the latrine. Two other respondents talked about specifically using
phenyl or "medicine" to clean the latrine after defecation due to coronavirus.

309

Change in childcare and support caregivers receive: About one fourth of caregivers (26%, N=9) described a change
in childcare or support with childcare tasks such as CFM. Six caregivers (18%) described being 'more alert' in their
childcare, such as paying closer attention to their child’s hygiene and ensuring they do not roam outside, two
caregivers (6%) received more childcare support now with more family members at home, and one caregiver (3%),
in contrast, expressed less support since she could no longer visit relatives.

310

Household cleaning

311

Over a third of respondents (41%, N=49) reported that COVID-19 or the lockdown changed their

312

household cleaning practices (Table 5). All respondents who reported a change described a

313

positive change, including cleaning the house more frequently since the pandemic started (34%

314

N=40) and either starting to use detergent/disinfectant or using more of it now (13%, N=16):

315
316

“When it comes to cleaning our house, we are doing it more than how we used to do it

317

earlier. Now, after coronavirus, instead of cleaning the house once a week, we have to do

318

it four times. After washing, we have to sanitize it and put some phenyl and bleaching

319

powder.”

320

- Male respondent, 65-69 years old (June 2020)

321
322

“We are staying clean. Earlier, we may or may not have washed the house, but now we

323

have to wash it.”

324

- Female caregiver respondent, 30-34 years old (June 2020)

325
326

“Yes, it has been communicated by TV that we should keep our house clean. People are

327

also getting aware of this. Now, there is no work for me. I have to spend all my time in

328

cleaning the house now. As I do not have to do any work outside my home, I have to do

329

some household work.”

Qualitative Themes and Descriptions


Cleaning house more frequently: 34% of respondents (N=40) explained that they have started cleaning their house
more frequently since the pandemic started. Some specified the change in frequency, such as cleaning once a week
to now twice a week or four times a week. Some of these respondents explained that they have ‘pucca’ (concrete)
floors and are washing and/or wiping them more frequently, whereas others have clay or earth floors and have
increased the frequency that they sweep or clean the floor by adding a layer of a cow dung/water mixture. When
washing floors, many described using water with phenyl, detergent, bleaching powder, or shampoo.



Use of detergent/disinfectant: 13% of respondents (N=16) said they had either started using or now use more of
detergent/disinfectant when cleaning their home due to COVID-19. One respondent elaborated that it is repeatedly
said on television that one needs to keep their home clean.



No change: Among those that reported no change (59%, N=70), some respondents said this was because they have
always cleaned their house frequently or properly, or that their house is always clean. One respondent said that
they clean their house whenever it is dirty, and another respondent said that they clean it whenever they feel like
it. A few respondents expressed that they were not aware that you should clean your house to protect against
COVID-19.

Discussion

334

The COVID-19 pandemic led to positive changes in WASH practices in rural Odisha, India. In

335

particular, we found the majority of respondents reported increased frequency and/or improved

336

handwashing practices, an important WASH behavior to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We

337

also found improvements in other WASH behaviors as a result of the pandemic for some villages

338

and respondents, including improved service delivery of village level water supply, increased

339

household water treatment, and improved household cleaning practices. There was minimal

340

change in defecation practices as the vast majority of respondents continued to use their

341

household’s latrine. The WASH infrastructure investments in study villages, including village-

342

level piped water supply and high household latrine coverage, likely aided in compliance with

343

COVID-19 preventative measures – particularly the ability to wash hands frequently and stay

344

home during strict lockdown periods. These findings can be useful for improving response to

345

COVID-19, understanding the effects of the pandemic on WASH behavior change and habit

346

formation, and building resiliency to be better prepared for future pandemics.

347
348

Participants overwhelmingly reported positive changes in handwashing due to the pandemic

349

(with 86% reporting a change), and few reporting challenges with frequently washing their hands

350

with soap and water. We found an increase in handwashing frequency and thoroughness, as well

351

as the use of soap, which remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and the first

352

lockdown went into effect in India, suggesting a new habit may have formed among adults and

353

children. Many respondents also linked handwashing behavior as a new and consistent practice

354

after additional actions throughout the day (such as returning home), offering further evidence

355

that habit formation was occurring for handwashing, which is an important predictor for

356

achieving sustained handwashing behavior change. 15,16 The longevity of these changes also

357

suggests that improved handwashing habits might remain after the pandemic subsides, which

358

could potentially lead to reduced disease transmission for other respiratory and fecal-oral

359

diseases, as was observed in Mexico after the H1N1 influenza pandemic. 17 Among the few

360

participants that reported barriers to handwashing in our study, this was attributed to the cost of

361

soap (8%) or challenges getting water (6%) that were often due to a problem with the water

362

supply system or water scarcity in the summer season. The proportion of respondents reporting

363

barriers to handwashing was substantially lower than a study among students and slum dwellers

364

in Uganda where 60.1% reported lack of soap, detergents, alcohol-based hand rub, or antiseptic

365

as a barrier to handwashing and 33.9% reported lack of running water as a barrier. 18 These

366

findings illustrate how the provision of soap and reliable water supply are needed to enable

367

individuals to practice the promoted preventative measure of handwashing. This is also in line

368

with common behavior change theories which include the concept of having an enabling

369

physical environment as a requisite for behavioral performance. 19–21 Therefore, the provision or

370

facilitation for accessibility of infrastructure along with mobilization towards proper use may be

371

required to achieve behavior change for many WASH practices and preventative measures.

372
373

Our results related to handwashing as a COVID-19 preventative measure are generally in

374

agreement with other studies. There were high levels of reported handwashing as a preventative

375

measure in online surveys throughout India,22–26 a phone survey in Tamil Nadu, India,27 and in-

376

person surveys in Ethiopia28 and Kenya,29 all of which found at least 85% of respondents

377

reported handwashing to prevent COVID-19. However, many of these surveys did not specify

378

water source access, the use of soap, or if there was a change in handwashing practices.

379

Additionally, most of the online surveys were in English and required literacy and internet

380

access, which likely skewed the population to wealthier urban respondents not representative of

381

rural villagers. Furthermore, the wording of the survey question could impact response, as seen

382

in our survey where 86% reported that COVID-19 or the lockdown had changed their

383

handwashing practices for the better, compared to 96% who reported that they had washed

384

hands/used hand sanitizer more frequently in the past 7 days as an action to avoid COVID-19. 11

385

This difference is likely due to the more qualitative nature of the former question that prompted

386

respondents to explain changes and give more detailed responses about their handwashing

387

practices. Overall, this study population had high levels of knowledge about the importance of

388

handwashing and other preventative measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19, and

389

reported primarily getting their information about COVID-19 from television news,

390

conversations with a community-level government worker, and/or social media or the internet. 11

391
392

Some households described improvements in other healthful WASH behaviors, such as water

393

treatment and/or household cleaning practices, which could also have beneficial effects on

394

overall disease transmission. Although the majority of households in these villages have

395

functional piped water connected to their households, the supply is intermittent in many cases,

396

often with set daily hours of operation, and many households are still storing water as a result. 30

397

Therefore, point-of-use treatment of water may still be required to ensure safe quality drinking

398

water in many of the villages where regular chlorination is not provided. The reported water

399

treatment and household cleaning behaviors may have been a kind of spillover behavior change

400

effect resulting from other messaging on preventing COVID-19 transmission. In addition,

401

VWSC members in many villages reported that government officials came to clean village water

402

tanks or add bleaching powder to the tank for water treatment, and these actions may have given

403

focus to proper water treatment and encouraged a general message of cleanliness. While these

404

WASH behaviors have not yet been proven to reduce transmission of COVID-19, they could

405

reduce transmission of other diseases such as diarrheal disease. 31

406
407

There was minimal change in defecation location as a result of the lockdowns or COVID-19,

408

with most respondents reporting continued latrine use. This is in line with the results of another

409

study in Tamil Nadu, India, which also found minimal change in defecation practices with 92%

410

of respondents reporting no change since the lockdown and the majority of respondents with a

411

private latrine continuing to use it and only a few (7%) beginning to use their private latrine as a

412

result of the pandemic.27 Our study area had high levels of latrine coverage and use prior to the

413

pandemic,30 which may have also contributed to the minimal change observed. Our qualitative

414

findings also suggest little change in the decision-making or motivational factors individuals

415

typically consider when choosing their place of defecation. Many respondents who reported no

416

change described aspects such as time of day, water supply, season, or condition of the latrine as

417

driving their defecation practice, which aligns with factors noted in previous work completed

418

prior to the pandemic in the nearby district of Puri in Odisha. 32 When defecation changes were

419

described by our participants, they were often a result of other factors caused by the lockdown,

420

such as reduced traveling to markets or other public areas that do not have latrines, with few

421

respondents associating defecation practices with COVID-19 risk. Additionally, although there is

422

room for improvement in child feces management practices in this study area, 33 caregivers did

423

not report any changes in these practices as a result of the pandemic.

425

Access to adequate WASH infrastructure can play a role in an individual’s ability to comply with

426

recommended COVID-19 preventative measures in two ways. First, adequate handwashing

427

requires sufficient water availability from easily accessible and reliable sources, with household

428

piped water being the highest level of access.34 Second, physical isolation at home for

429

individuals suspected to have COVID-19 as well as the general population during periods of

430

strict lockdown have been promoted as measures to reduce transmission. However, these

431

measures are only feasible if there is adequate water, hygiene, and latrine facilities in a

432

household; otherwise household members would need to access public locations to retrieve

433

water, bathe, and defecate.34 We found in our study that good WASH infrastructure enabled

434

compliance with preventive measures like handwashing or staying home, as participants were

435

able to use their latrine and wash their hands at home. A separate study in Tamil Nadu, India

436

found that respondents of the same age, gender, and education who had access to a private toilet

437

were more likely to report they increased the frequency of handwashing since the lockdown, 27

438

further suggesting that infrastructure played a role in COVID-19 handwashing practices. Overall,

439

these findings suggest that investments in WASH infrastructure, such as a piped water supply,

440

not only ensure individuals have an enabling environment to perform promoted WASH practices

441

but may also play a role in building the resilience of rural communities against future disease

442

outbreaks.

443
444

There are some limitations of this study. First, it relied on phone interviews, so we could only

445

include participants with a mobile phone and network connection. This may exclude some of the

446

poorest and most remote households, although we were able to interview some participants who

447

lived in villages without a mobile network by calling them when they were in an area outside of

448

their village that had network. Additionally, responses were self-reported. This could introduce

449

reporting bias, as respondents sometimes overreport hygienic behaviors like handwashing due to

450

courtesy bias or social desirability bias.35–37 Self-reports of increased handwashing also do not

451

measure if handwashing is being performed correctly. While some respondents in our study

452

explained they had learned the correct handwashing technique due to COVID-19 information

453

campaigns and are now washing all parts of their hands, this may not be true of the entire study

454

population. For example, in a study in Nigeria, only 39% of respondents washed all critical parts

455

of their hands correctly when asked to demonstrate handwashing, compared to 90.5% of

456

respondents who reported practicing regular handwashing with soap and water to prevent

457

COVID-19.38 We tried to reduce reporting bias and capture detailed experiences by including

458

several open-ended questions and asking for follow-up explanations to closed-ended questions.

459

Finally, we targeted respondents who resided in villages that had completed the MANTRA

460

program that installed village-level piped water and created high levels of sanitation access, 30

461

and therefore results related to WASH practices may not be generalizable to other villages with

462

lower levels of water and sanitation access.

463
464

The research revealed rich descriptions of changes in WASH practices among rural villagers in

465

Odisha as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including improvements in handwashing

466

practices that were promoted for COVID-19 prevention, as well as improvements in other

467

WASH practices that were not directly promoted such as water treatment and household

468

cleaning. With regards to handwashing, we found an increase in handwashing frequency,

469

thoroughness, and use of soap, and that these practices remained in place a few months after the

470

pandemic began and were often described as a new and consistent practice after additional daily

actions, suggesting new habit formation that could potentially lead to sustained handwashing

472

behavior change. The role of barriers and enabling factors were also described for WASH-related

473

preventive practices, including the provision of soap and a reliable water supply. The results also

474

highlight the importance of adequate WASH infrastructure, including piped water, in enabling

475

resilience and allowing villagers to practice safe behaviors during a large-scale health crisis.
