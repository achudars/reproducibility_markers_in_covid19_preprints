ABSTRACT: Policymakers and researchers describe the COVID-19 epidemics by
waves without a common vocabulary on what constitutes an epidemic wave, either in
terms of a working definition or operationalization, causing inconsistencies and
confusions. A working definition and operationalization can be helpful to characterize
and communicate about epidemics. We propose a working definition of epidemic
waves in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and an operationalization based on the
public data of the effective reproduction number R. Our operationalization
characterizes the numbers and durations of waves (upward and downward) in 179
countries and reveals patterns that can enable healthcare organizations and
policymakers to make better description and assessment of the COVID crisis to make
more informed resource planning, mobilization, and allocation temporally in the
continued COVID-19 pandemic.
ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: A working definition and operationalization of
waves to enable common ground to understand and communicate COVID-19 crisis.

On June 16, 2020, Mike Pence, US vice president then, penned an op-ed in The Wall Street
Journal headlined: “There isn’t a coronavirus ‘second wave’” (1). Yet on the same day, the
American top federal infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, countered via The Wall
Street Journal that: “People keep talking about a second wave,” he said. “We’re still in a first
wave” (2). A Google web search revealed over 30 million mentions of COVID “second waves”
by early Nov 2020. What do they mean by “first wave” and “second wave”? Unfortunately, "a
wave is just a metaphor … -a term without a precise definition in epidemiology” (3).
Despite its lack of a definition, the concept of second wave has gained huge popularity,
with broad implications. For instance, the UK Prime Minister warned all UK citizens that they
must “prepare for the second wave of COVID” (4). Israeli authorities released officially that “the
country was going through a second wave” (3). And the Chief Medical Officer of Australia,
Brendan Murphy, said a second wave would be "the most worrying thing of all". Similarly,
scientists have used the term repeatedly. For example, A Lancet article has warned about the
possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 pandemic as early as April 2020 (5). All of us want to
know whether their places are experiencing the first wave, have gone through the peak of it, or
are battling the second wave, third round, etc, because such assessment of the COVID epidemics
carries profound implications on people’s lives, works, and physical and mental health (6). After
all, the concept of waves in the past pandemics, such as the 1918 influenza epidemic (7), greatly
helped people to understand those pandemics in greater detail to enable better communication,
policies and actions
The article aims to bring a working definition of what constitutes a wave in the ongoing
COVID pandemic so that people can have a common language to use, interpret and discuss

epidemic waves, which are increasingly a concern worldwide. The working definition does not
aim to offer a strict definition of waves in epidemiology but instead uses the prevailing
characterizations of epidemic waves to reduce the arbitrariness that muddles the tumultuous
concept at present. A thorough search of the academic literature and the popular media reveals
M.D., epidemiologists, and policymakers do share the same underlying characterization of the
term wave to give it some conceptual clarity. Popular media state “the word ‘wave’ implies a
natural pattern of peaks and valleys” (8). Similarly, WHO, clarified "in order to say one wave is
ended, the virus has to be brought under control and cases have to fall substantially,… Then for a
second wave to start, you need a sustained rise in infections" (9). "A wave is also different to a
"spike" in cases — another frequently used term” (3). "A spike [or upsurge] is a momentary
phenomenon” (3). Moreover, in the case of epidemic waves of COVID, “it is probably not
realistic for the number of new cases to drop to zero, but ideally one would like to see sustained
decreases in the number of new cases over time or stability in the number of new cases over time”
(10).
Such convergence in conceptual clarity of the term “wave” allows us to offer a working
definition of the concept based on two key defining characteristics: 1) an epidemic wave
constitutes some upward and/or downward periods; 2) the increase in an upward period or the
decrease in a downward period have to be substantial by sustaining over a period of time to
distinguish them from an uptick, a downtick, reporting errors, or volatility in new cases.
We propose to operationalize the epidemic wave in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by
a publicly available popular real-time index, the effective reproduction number, R, which refers
to the average number of people infected by a single infectious individual in real-time as the

epidemic happens (11). When R>1, the number of cases increases, and when R<1 the number of
cases decreases. R plays a central role in the epidemiology of infectious diseases and the R
values are, because R estimates are not sensitive to potential model misspecification and fairly
accurate even when new cases are imperfectly measured (11-13). If R is significantly larger than
1 for a sustained period, we identify that time period as an upward period, and inversely, If R is
significantly smaller than 1 for a sustained period, we identify a downward period.
Based on the working definition and the proposed operationalization, we used public data
on R to identify 179 countries that experienced some COVID-19 epidemic waves from 29th
March 2020 to 26th Jan 2021. This working definition and operationalization, as we demonstrate,
is straightforward yet can be customized or subject to robustness checks. We hope to offer a
stepstone towards a common understanding of what constitutes an epidemic wave and enables us
to be more effective in combating the continuing pandemic.
Calibrating a working operationalization for COVID-19
We now describe the procedure to calibrate a working operationalization for COVID-19
(details in the Supplement). We illustrate one possible calibration of a working definition of
epidemic waves of COVID-19 based on the COVID-19 contexts, especially considering the
temporality of transmission and the cyclicity of infection case reporting. An individual can
exhibit symptoms 11 days after the initial infection, with a confidence interval of 8 to 15 days
(14). That is, the reporting of Covid-19 cases of people infected on day t will appear between day
t + 8 to day t + 15. This variance in the temporal lag implies a potential covariance among Rt
estimates within 7 days from each other. Therefore, it is a reasonable calibration to set J=7.
Having J = 7 implies that at n must be at least 7. The choice of n should capture consecutive days

to allow at least a two-chain transmission process to occur to model the sequential propagation of
the epidemics in a region. The serial interval of one sequential propagation is estimated to be
between 4 and 6 days (15), and we take 6 days, the upper limit, for prudence, and therefore n
needs to be at least 7+6 = 13 days to capture a two-chain propagation in epidemic transmissions.
Another critical consideration is the weekly cyclicity in COVID-19 infection cases seasonality
(e.g., fewer cases on Sundays in many countries). To account for the weekly cyclicity, we try to
set n = 14. An upward (downward) period refers to a period of at least n (=14) consecutive days
when Rt is bigger (smaller) than 1.
The pandemic data used are the daily estimations of Rt that can be downloaded freely
from their website (16) for each country when they have had at least 100 infections or more. The
serial interval option used is the default option at 5 (the public R data contains several option
intervals). We have incorporated results up to January 26th, 2020.
Number and duration of upward and downward waves
The definition of a wave necessarily implies a period in which the number of cases goes up.
After an upward, it is both possible for the cases to stabilize or go down. Table 1 reports the total
amount of upward periods from March 29, 2020 to January 26, 2021 of 179 countries. There are
270 upward periods in total. Most countries (73.2%) have had at least one upward periods.
Specifically, the number of countries with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 upward periods are 45, 52, 20, 9 and 5
respectively. There are 48 countries without any upward period, and such countries are mostly
small countries, island countries, or undeveloped countries that testing might be lacking. There
are a total of 37 downward periods. Most countries (85.4%) had no downward period so far.
Specifically, the number of countries with 1, 2, 3 downward periods are 19, 6, and 2,

respectively. The number of downward periods does not match the number of upwards periods
because many countries still had not had success in decreasing their cases for a sustained period
of time to constitute a downward period by early 2021.
The duration of upward periods varied too. The average upward period’s length is 61.7 days
(s.d.= 47.0), and three quarters of them lasted less than 31 days. The minimum and maximum
upward were 15 and 302 days, respectively. The distribution is skewed positively with a value of
2.4, as illustrated in Figure 1a, which shows the distribution of the duration of the 270 upward
periods. The duration of downward periods averaged 33.6 days (s.d.= 17.0). The distribution is
also skewed positively, with a value of 3.1, as illustrated in Figure 1b.
DISCUSSION
This paper offers a working definition of epidemic waves that can characterize the
ongoing COVID pandemic in rea-time. The data used to operationalize the epidemic wave are
publicly available (e.g., the website of John Hopkins COVID-19 statistics) not only at the
country-level but also at the more granular regional levels (e.g., the USA states) to characterize
epidemic waves at different levels. It is also possible to include the upward and downward
periods of waves in such websites to enable a common ground for public and the policymakers to
understand the ongoing epidemics.
First, it is essential to characterize waves, and our working definition and an
operationalization provides a common ground for health communication, as to date such a
common ground is lacking among different world leaders and healthcare experts. Our
characterization approach consists of a statistical criterion that can be applied in real-time, so that
we are not subject to various post hoc interpretations of waves, as it happened in the Spanish flu

pandemic. The characterization of waves can help policymakers to make more informed
decisions on resource mobilization and distribution over time as the COVID-19 epidemic
evolves. Reliable descriptions are essential for estimating the true impact of COVID- 19 and the
control of COVID-19 across countries over time. “All of this requires collection of clear,
uniform and comparable” characterization of the epidemic in real-time, and we hope our working
definition of an epidemic wave offers a springboard in that direction (17).
Second, our findings that most countries (e.g., USA and UK) have had more upward
periods than downward periods in the year 2020 suggest that these countries had not decreased
the infection for a sustained period of time. The containment strategies in many countries
(especially developed countries) have broken the upward periods (i.e., upward, stagnant, and
then upward) but did not result in a sustained period of time and hence may effectively just
delayed the epidemic and could have wasted the window of opportunities. Indeed, many
countries and regions declared success in their containment strategies in mid-2020 while in fact
they did not decrease the infection for a sustained period of time. Our characterization of
epidemic waves can help to examine the effectiveness of interventions from the identification of
downward periods as well as the triggers of upward periods across regions to prevent the
occurrence of subsequent waves.
While it is hard to compare the daily or total COVID-19 deaths and cases between
countries due to their different sizes, waves capture the changes (upward or downward) within a
country and hence present an alternative approach to assess the fluctuation of epidemics in a
country or a region. The working definition of epidemic waves can be universally applied across
countries/regions, hence offering an alternative way that is more comparable, given that

“epidemiology is built on the idea of studying differences between populations. Much of what
we have learnt about the causes of disease has had its origins in comparisons of countries” (18).
As countries adopt different approaches over time to deal with the COVID-19, it offers some
possibilities to learn what works best for controlling COVID-19, given the lack of real
randomized control experiments in epidemiology. Epidemiologists call for “more thoughtful and
thorough analyses of country differences, … remain probably the most important and most valid
evidence for informing COVID-19 policy in real-time” (18). Specifically, the identification of
the upward and downward periods (counts and durations) in various countries may be matched
with the containment strategies in those countries to help identify effective strategies to curtail
the wave.
Limitation and future research
Our approach is limited by the following points. First, COVID-19 daily cases may be
misreported, and reporting delays and inconsistent practices for defining and testing COVID-19
cases may also influence the accuracy of daily cases, which are the input to calculate the
reproduction rate and hence the characterization of waves. To reduce the noise and errors in daily
reporting, our definition picks the average of the past 14 days. However, the average over 14-day
samples does come at a trade-off that a sharp to exceptionally low values within a couple of days
may not be statistically significant. Our choice of the parameter offers one possible illustration of
the calibration of a working definition of epidemic waves, and other calibrations are possible.
Our working definition characterizes waves by upward periods and downward periods, the
fundamental elements of waves. We notice many broken waves (i.e., an upward period, a break,
an upward period), so epidemic waves may not follow a symmetrical pattern of an upward period

followed by a downward period in some waves. Moreover, as the COVID-19 crisis still
continues and worsens in many parts of the world, our findings remain incomplete and need to
be updated as new data arrive.
Conclusion
A wave of COVID-19 cannot be declared arbitrarily by any individuals without a
common definition. The first questions we need to understand are: ‘what do we mean by
epidemic waves, then where do waves occur and not occur, and what can we learn from this?’
We hope that our working definition and operationalization offers a stepping stone to better
understand the epidemics to help with containing the continuing COVID-19 crisis.

SUPPLEMENT
To characterize an epidemic wave of having at least an upward and/or downward periods forr a
sustained period of time in a country, we employ Rt, a time series estimates of the reproduction
on
number (11). If the average reproduction rate in the last n days is above 1, there is evidence off a
sustained upward period. Similarly, if the average reproduction rate in the last n days is below 1,
there is evidence of a sustained downward period. Formally, we test the null hypothesis 1 and
nd
alternative hypothesis 2, where

terms, the posterior distribution of each of the estimates will rapidly converge to a normal
distribution, and the weighted sum of normally distributed variables, ¯ x, is also normally
distributed. The variance, however, depends on whether the estimates were completely
independent between themselves. If so, the second term in equation 5 would be zero and
calculation of V[¯ x] would be the sum of the variance of each estimate in the sample, divided by
n2. However, the covariance among some estimates may not be zero, as it is likely to have
positive covariance in adjacent dates in a time series. Since it is impossible to know the value of
these covariance terms in real-time in reality, we use an upper bound for the covariance of
adjacent variables in the second term based on the statistical property that the covariance
between two variables can never be bigger than the biggest variance of both variables as the
upper bound for the variance, described in equation 5.
The number and duration of upward and downward waves by regions and country groups
We break down the count and duration of upward and downward first by developed and
developing (including undeveloped) economies. Developed countries have experienced a similar
number of upward periods to developing countries (133 times vs. 137 times) but shorter upward
periods (52.9 days vs. 70.2 days; d=-17.3 days) than developing countries. Moreover, developed
countries have experienced a similar number of downward periods to developing countries (19
times vs. 18 times) but shorter downward periods (30.5 days vs. 36.9 days; d=-6.4 days) than
developing countries. Most of the developed economies have gone through more than one
upward periods, though not always followed by a downward one (65.1% that have at least one
upward period have no downwards). For example, the US has suffered three upward periods, but
not any downward period; Italy has had three upward periods but only one downward period.

Many developed economies have had upward periods, followed by some effort to contain the
upward trend, yet the effort has mostly tempered the reproduction to stabilize it rather than being
able to lead to a sustained downward period. Such a characterization can help policymakers and
healthcare organizations to better understand the typical patterns by not only economic
development but also by other attributes (e.g., cultural, institutional, populational factors), for
better planning, resource allocation and policy decisions in advance. For instance, health
authorities can better plan the temporal demand for medical resources, whereas economic
policymakers can be more informed in drafting policies.
Correlation between upward/downward counts/duration and other country-level statistics
We examine how the duration and count of upward and downward periods correlated with
each other and other key country-level statistics (Table 2). The duration of upward periods and
the duration of downward periods are negatively correlated (r=-0.27, p=.00), indicating countries
with longer upward periods tend to have shorter downward periods. The number of upward and
the duration of downward period in a country are also positively correlated (r=0.27, p=.00),
indicating countries with more upward periods tend to have more downward periods.
Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have shorter duration of upward periods (r= 0.09, p=.00) and downward periods (r= -.14, p=.00) yet more number of upward periods (r= .28,
p=.00) and downward periods (r= .32, p=.00). Similarly, countries with higher Human
Development Index (HDI) tend to have shorter duration of upward periods (r= -.14, p=.00) and
downward periods (r= -.24, p=.00) yet more number of upward periods (r= .40, p=.00) and
downward periods (r= .11, p=.00). Lastly we examine the correlation with the stringency index,
which reveals that countries with more stringent measures on COVID-19 have shorter duration

of upward periods (r= -.02, p=.00) and downward periods (r= -.32, p=.00) and more upward
periods (r= .26, p=.00) and fewer downward periods (r=-.05, p=.00).
Such patterns can inform policymakers and healthcare organizations. For instance, knowing
the pattern that longer upward periods are usually followed by longer downward periods has
direct implications for planning and resource allocation decisions on medical supplies, personnel,
infrastructure, etc. Such information is crucial not only for healthcare organizations and policies
but also for social and economic policies, as the COVID-19 situation changers the socialeconomic policies that aim to cope with the epidemic situations.
