Abstract
Background
The closure of communities, including schools, has been adopted to control the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in most countries. Operating schools safely during the
pandemic requires a balance between health risks and the need for in-person learning. We use
compartmental models to explore school reopening scenarios.

Methods
Using demographic and epidemiological data between July 31 and November 23, 2020 from the
city of Toronto, we developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-RecoveredHospitalized-Isolated model. Our model with age, household, and community transmission allow
us to study the impact of schools open in September 2020. The model mimics the transmission in
households, the community, and schools, accounting for differences in infectiousness between
adults and children and youth and adults' working status. We assessed the extent to which school
opening may have contributed to COVID-19 resurgence in the fall and simulated scenarios for
the safe reopening of schools up to May 31, 2021. We further considered the impact of the
introduction of the new variant of concern.

Findings
Though a slight increase in infections among adults (2.8%) and children (5.4%) is anticipated by
the end of the year, safe school opening is possible with stringent nonpharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) decreasing the risk of transmission in the community and the household.
We found that while school reopening was not the key driver in virus resurgence, but rather it
was community spread that determined the outbreak trajectory, brief school closures did reduce
infections when transmission risk within the home was low. When considered possible crossinfection amongst households, communities, and schools, we found that home transmission was
crucial for mitigating the epidemic and safely operating schools. Simulating the introduction of a
new strain with higher infectiousness, we observed substantial increases in infections, even when
both schools and communities are closed.

Interpretation
Schools can open safely under strict maintenance of strict public health measures in the
community. The gradual opening of schools and communities can only be achieved by
maintaining NPIs and mitigating household transmission risk to avoid the broader escape of
infections acquired in schools into the community via households. If the new COVID-19 strain is
more infectious for children, public spaces, including schools, should be closed, and additional
NPIs, including the use of masks, should be extended to toddlers.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The design of a gradual school reopening strategy remains at the heart of decision-making on
reopening after shut-downs to control the epidemic. Although available studies have assessed the
risk of school reopening by modelling the transmission across schools and communities, it
remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children and
youth.We used GoogleScholar and PubMed searches to identify previous published works. We
used te following terms: “school closure”, “covid 19 school closure”, “reopening schools”,
“reopening screening school”, “school household second wave model”. The search of the studies
ended in January 2021. Papers in other languages than English and letters were excluded from
the search. Two modelling studies examined the effects of screening and delayed school
reopening, two other agent-based modelling studies explored the epidemic spread across
different age groups.

Added-value of this study
We find that the resurgence of COVID-19 in Toronto in fall 2020 mainly resulted from the
increase of contact rate among adults in the community, and that the degree of in-person
attendance had the most significant impact on transmission in schools. To our knowledge, our
work is the first to investigate the resurgence in infections following school reopening and the
impact of risk mitigation measures in schools operation during the pandemic. Our novel and
comprehensive model considers the age and household structure, but also considers three
different settings, school, household and community. We further examined the effects of selfscreening procedures, class size, and schooling days on transmission, which enabled us to
compare scenarios of school reopening separately for both adults and children and youth, and
model the cross-infection between them to avoid potential underestimation. We found that after
schools opened, reducing household transmission was crucial for mitigating the epidemic since it
can reduce cross-infection amongst households, communities and schools. Lastly, given the
recent report of SARS-CoV-2 variant (VOC202012/01), we investigated the impact of the new
variant that may be more infectious in children and youth.

Implications of all the available evidence
Our analysis can inform policymakers of planning the safe reopening of schools during COVID19. We suggest that integrating strict NPIs and school control measures are crucial for safe
reopening. When schools are open, reducing transmission risk at home and community is
paramount in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Lastly, if children are more susceptible to the
new COVID-19 VOC, both schools and community must be closed, the time children spend in
essential services locations minimized, and NPI’s for those aged less than three years enforced.

1. Background introduction
Education has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In most countries, the
epidemic was controlled in spring 2020 by restrictive measures such as travel bans and closures
of non-essential businesses and educational establishments. By mid-April 2020, 94% of learners
worldwide were affected by the pandemic, representing 1.58 billion children and youth (C&Y),
from pre-primary to higher education, in 200 countries1. Although school closure may help
control the epidemic2, it results in significant detrimental effects, including affecting children's
learning, placing a high burden on the parents, and reducing economic productivity3. Hence,
policymakers worldwide have had to make difficult decisions about whether and how to reopen
schools over the past several months. To date, there has been no easy answer or single standard4.
Several studies have highlighted that to maintain control of the epidemic as we ease restrictive
closures, stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) need to be in place. These include
effective and rapid case detection with isolation of cases, effective and rapid contact tracing and
quarantine of contacts, and maintenance of distancing by the public5-7. Many countries reopened
schools over summer 2020 and beginning of September, adapting multiple control measures,
such as cohort approach, distantiated single desks, use of masks, and hand sanitizer8,9. However,
the cases in schools have been reported continuously10. Risk mitigation measures in schools,
such as daily self-screening for symptoms and virtual attendance11, may help minimize infections
in school-aged children, and subsequent transmission of infections acquired in schools into the
wider community. Still, the effectiveness of these and other mitigation strategies have yet to be
examined.
The efficiency of school closure to mitigate infectious disease for different diseases, including
COVID-19, has been widely studied12-18. However, school closure is not a long-term solution, so
schools' safe reopening is a crucial issue. Few studies have built compartmental models to
examine the potential effects of school opening mitigation measures as the epidemic
progressed18,19. For example, Paltiel18found that screening every 2 days using a rapid,
inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral rules, was
estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return
of students to campuses. Others studies using agent-based models also suggested school
reopening may lead to a second wave without strengthening NPIs3,20.
While these studies have highlighted the important role of school reopening in the trajectory of
COVID-19, the transmission of infections acquired in schools into the wider community via
transmission in households with children has not been considered. Furthermore, to date there has
been no literature on whether the resurgence of COVID-19 was driven by increasing of contacts
between C&Y or adults. In December 2020 a new COVID-19 variant of concern (VOC) in UK
was reported21 and, the increasing number of cases in ages 0-19 years maybe that C&Y are more
susceptible to the variant22,23. Consequently, school reopening after the holiday is still under
discussion. Although there is currently no evidence regarding this new strain's infectiousness, it
is critical to examine the potential impact of higher susceptibility in schooling children for a safe
school reopening strategy.

We developed a compartmental model that considers age groups, household structure and
transmission, coupled with different levels of population-wide NPIs and school mitigation
strategies, to explore potential scenarios for the safe reopening of schools following the winter
break. We used demographic and epidemiological data from the city of Toronto, Canada, across
the multiple phases of escalation and de-escalation policies regarding schools and community.
The model framework, analyses and conclusions can be easily applied to other regions.

2. Method
2.1 Model description and assumptions
We explore the impact of school opening using a deterministic age-household-locationstructured Susceptible -Exposed  - Asymptomatic - (subclinical) – Infectious  (prodromal
phase)- Infectious  (with symptoms) - Recovered R model framework, including two further
compartments, depending on infection severity: hospitalization (H) and fully isolated (W)
(SEAIRHW). The population is classified into adults (>19) and children and youth (0-19), which
labeled as , , respectively. The location structure includes households, schools, and community.
Using census data of Toronto in 201624, we established the average household size of 2 for
households without children, and 3 for households with children. Depending on the working
status of the adults, we further classify the household into working-from-home (in subscript q),
with no social activity, and working-outside-of-home (in subscript g), with social activities in the
community. When schools reopened, families were able to opt for either in-person or virtual
learning. Hence, a proportion of C&Y attends school in person (in subscript sc) or stays at home
(in superscript h). For notational convenience, henceforth we will indicate the working-fromhome household with 'WFH' and household working outside the home with 'WO'. Population and
community classifications are reported in Appendix Table A1.
We model transmission over two periods: before and after schools reopened in September 2020.
Before school reopened, all individuals from WFH are assumed to be susceptible, but, once
C&Y go back to school, adults may return to work. This will convert these households from
WFH to WO. While schools are closed, C&Y are at risk of infection in their household. If C&Y
are also part of a WO (socially active) household, the risk of infection will be possible from both
family members and the community. After schools reopen, C&Y attending school in person will
further face risk of infection from within the school. Similarly, adults can be infected by
household members including children, or, if belonging to WO, from the community as well.
NPIs have been shown to be extremely important for controling the epidemic. We include
detection and isolation of COVID-19 cases by testing and tracing, implementation of quarantine
at home of people contacting infected cases, as well as social distancing25. Also, control
measures specific to the school setting included: quarantine and contact tracing of school cases,
mandatory self-screening procedures, optional in-person attendance. Figure 1 describes the
dynamics of our model. See Appendix A for details on returning (back-to-school) rate, going out
rate, quarantine, isolation ratios, household structure and model equations (see Appendix Tables
A2-A3 for model assumptions, variables, and parameters).

The instantaneous reproduction number (  ) is estimated by using daily new cases by episode
date26,27, assuming a Gamma distributed serial interval range from 2.2-7.8 days with a standard
deviation of 4.1-5.9 days considering the serial interval is shorten over time by NPIs28. Also, we
estimate  on weekly sliding windows.

2.2 Data sources and calibration
According to census data, the average household size in Toronto is 2.4, and 38.39% have
children24. For simplicity, we assume that all the households have 2 or 3 members, depending on
whether they have children. Our model is calibrated using publicly available surveillance data26.
The optimal values of the per-contact transmission probability of adults, the average number of
contacts among adults in the community, the transmission risk in the household, the quarantine
rate of symptomatic adults and C&Y, the maximum rate of the adult from WFH back to work
and efficiency of self-screening procedures are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared
differences between the model’s estimates of adults and C&Y confirmed case and data on these
two indicators between Jul 31, 2020, and Nov 23, 2020, collected from the Toronto government
website26. The parameters estimated and from the literature are presented in Table A4
(Appendix A).
Our estimation shows that the per-contact transmission probability increased by 8.6% (from 2.41%
to 2.62%), and up to 25.7% of adults returned to work after the school opened. The contact rate
between adults rose by 11.7%, and the contact rate between adults and children rose by 9.1%.
Surprisingly, the contact rate for children only increased by 1.5%.

3. Results
3.1 The risk of school reopening
Our results show that opening schools will lead to more infections in C&Y than in adults (figure
2A,B). However, if the contact rate in the community and per-contact transmission probability
remains unchanged (i.e., current transmission risk, as of the date of Nov 23) after schools
opened, that is, people adhere to social distancing and other NPIs are in place, the school
reopening may not cause a large increase in infections (2.5% increase in adults and 5.4%
increase in C&Y by Dec 31, 2020, figure 2A,B). Similar trends are shown under low
transmission risk if public health control measures are strengthened (0.8% increase in adults
infections and 2.6% increase in C&Y infections by Dec 31, 2020, figure 2C,D).
On the other hand, if the contact rate in the community increases by 10% after schools open, the
cumulative infection of adults and C&Y will increase significantly (88.0% and 123.1% by Dec
31, 2020, respectively, figure 2C,D). If only the infection rate between adults in the community
increases by 10%, this results in a large increase in infections among adults and C&Y (71.8%,
92.4% by Dec 31, 2020, respectively, figure 2C,D). This may give us some insight that the
secondary outbreak after the school opened may result from the increase in the contact rate
between adults in the community.

3.2 Optimal safe reopening strategies to mitigate the current rising trend
Under current risks, the  of Toronto on Dec 31, 2020 calculated based on model was around
1.2. Given the current contact rate in the community, per-contact transmission probability and
the home transmission risk are too high to keep the instantaneous reproduction number (  )
below 1. To control the  below 1, the risk of home transmission needs to be reduced to 0.5%,
and the contact rate between adults in the community needs to be kept below 9, if the current
adult’s per-contact transmission probability is 2.19% (1.1% for children)(figure 3A,B). Also,
suppose the current community contact rate is maintained. In that case, the home transmission
risk needs be reduced to 0.5% to control the epidemic, although the per-contact transmission
probability reduced to 1.8% (0.9% for children)(figure 3C,D). After schools are open, controlling
the transmission risk at home and in the community is crucial to mitigate the epidemic.

3.3 Modeling predictions
In the short term, school closures for a period (extending the holiday period, assumed two weeks
in the simulations), can reduce the spread of the epidemic to a certain extent (figures 4A, B), on
the premise that the risk of family transmission does not rise in the holiday period. The least
risky scenario is when extending school closures and the contact rate in the community is
reduced by 10%, and the cumulative infections of adults and C&Y by Jan 31 will drop by 26.6%
and 25.2%, respectively. However, the worst case will happen if the household transmission risk
increases by 10% during the period of school closures, and the extended vacation will increase
the spread of the epidemic in both the adult population and the C&Y population (2.6% increase
in adults and 3.9% increase in C&Y by Jan 31, 2020).
When extending the forecast to May 31, 2021, our model predicts that school reopening is not
the key to the outbreak of the epidemic, but the risk of transmission in the community determines
the trend of the epidemic (figures 4C, D). If the community risk is low, safe school opening is
feasible, when strict NPIs measures are implemented and the community transmission risk is not
increased after the school opens. Although the infection of adults and C&Y will increase slightly,
and the increment of C&Y infection will be higher than adults after the school opening. However,
The stricter NPIs and school closures may be needed if the new strain is introduced which has
higher transmission probability and more infectious for C&Y. The new variant may cause a large
outbreak even under the strictest control measures( the number of infections of adults and C&Y
till May 31, 2021 under the new strain virus is 3.6 times and 4.2 times that of the old strain,
figures A4). An exponential increasing epidemic occurs irrespective of whether schools are
closed or open with high community transmission risk due to weak NPIs (community is fully
opened as in stage 3 in Ontario, Table A5).

4. Conclusion and discussion
Our novel and the complex model considers age structure and household transmission, allowing
us to examine three different risks within and between households, communities, and schools,
and to explore is the school reopening responsible for the fall outbreaks. We found that school
opening can be safe under strict NPIs, although there will be a slight increase in infections
among adults (by Dec 31, 2.8%) and children (5.4%). However, whether the reopening of
schools can cause another outbreak mainly depends on the countermeasures in the community.
The increase in cases occurring when schools are opened is primarily due to the rise of contact
between adults who can now return to work and social activities. Overall, reducing the contact
rate in the community is more effective in mitigating the epidemic. Nonetheless, reducing the

contact rate in the community has a larger impact on reducing the cases of adults, while reducing
transmission risk within the home is more effective in reducing infections in C&Y.
The safe operations of schools during the pandemic necessitates risk mitigation measures. The
effectiveness of those measures is examined (figureA3, table A6). Attendance is the biggest
driver of infection; with high attendance, we also need these extra measures that are in place in
Toronto. Also, to enable the safe opening of schools, it is not sufficient to control the spread in
the community. When schools open, the increase in adults and C&Y activities, and the risk of
transmission within the household will lead to an increase in cross-infection risk in schools,
communities, and households. Hence, controlling household transmission risk is paramount.
Only at low levels of risk of family transmission can schools and communities be open, given a
similar overall infection risk. Our predictions show that, in the long term, if the household
transmission is not reduced, the cases will keep increasing even if schools remain closed for 2
additional weeks following the holiday break. Though reducing household transmission is
difficult, public health communication should emphasize preventative practices for students
returning from school, including washing hands, changing clothes, and mask-wearing. Besides,
the aggressive testing, tracing, isolation of mild cases29 (figure A5), the Fangcang shelter
hospital30 both are effective to decrease the spreading, then to reduce the infection in the
household. Nevertheless, the key to allowing safe school opening is the maintenance of strict
NPIs usage in the community and reducing community spread.
We also examined the consquences of the new COVID-19 variant of concern. Even with strict
NPI’s and school closures, the number of cases could rise rapidly within a few months. Our
findings suggest that assuming that C&Y are more susceptible to the new virus variant, the city
should immediately shut down the communities and schools. Moreover, if the new strain is more
infectious in younger children less than 3 years of age, reducing the amount of time they spend in
the community and increasing their use of NPIs, such as mask-wearing, should be considered.
Our analyses have some limitations. Firstly, our school compartment does not include adults,
such as teachers, employees, and staff working in the school. However, in the community, we
include all three types of contacts between adults and C&Y. When schools are opened, the
contact between adults and C&Y in schools can be reflected in the increase of that in the
community. Therefore, this reasonable simplification can also fit our purpose within this analysis.
Secondly, the age classification in our model only includes adults and C&Y, and no more
detailed classification is added, hence the vulnerable person was not included in this study. Due
to the incorporation of the household structure, the complexity of our model has significantly
increased, the overall model dimension has risen more than 300. In addition, the results of our
model have well explained the impact of school opening on the epidemic. Our reasonable
simplification of the age structure will not affect our analysis of school opening risks and
prevention and control and our model assumptions have been checked with policymakers. When
these measures cannot be effectively implemented, the risk of school opening needs to be
reconsidered and evaluated. Also, in the long-term forecast, our assumptions about the contact
rate in the community and the per-contact transmission probability may be too optimistic. The
results of long-term forecasts should be considered as the minimum risk. At the same time, it did

not consider that the government might adopt other control measures after the infection increased.
We are more concerned about the comparison of the impact of different levels of openness of
schools and communities on the development of the epidemic. Furthermore, the infectiousness
among C&Y aged younger than 19 years is assumed to be 50% of the adults. We make this
assumption based on the currently available research suggesting that the susceptibility of
children is lower than that of adults. But it may be different from this ratio with further
investigation and we also examine the scenarios with new strain variant if more infectious in
C&Y population (figure A4).
In summary, our findings suggest that the combination of stringent public health measures to
control transmission in the community, mitigation efforts in schools, and efforts to minimize
transmission in the household can allow for the safe reopening of schools. However, when
schools open, the increasing contacts among adults in the community will lead to another largescale surge in the epidemic in the absence of adequate NPIs. Controlling transmission within the
household, particularly for students returning home from school, could be key to preventing
cross-transmission between the household, the community, and the school with both the schools
and community settings open.

Appendix A
1. Detailed modeling methodology
On Jul 31, the city of Toronto enters Stage 3 of reopening, nearly all businesses and public
spaces can gradually reopen. Also, the school start opening on Sep 80. We build a compartmental
model incorporating both age, household, and location structures. The population is classified
into adults (>19) and children and youth (0-19), which labeled as , , respectively. The location
structure includes households, schools, and community. We consider the following average sizes
of households: 2, when the family members are just adults, and 3 for families with 1 child. Also,
depending on the working status of the adults, we further classify the household into two
categories: working-from-home (in subscript q), with no social activity, and working-outside-ofhome (in subscript g), with social activities in the community. After school is reopened, families
opt for either in-person or online learning. Hence, a proportion of children and youth is
considered to go to school (in subscript sc) or stay at home. For notational convenience,
henceforth we will indicate the working-from-home household with WFH and working-outsidehome household with WO. The population and community classifications are reported in Table
A1. We note that we omit demographic components, such as immigration, birth, and natural
death.

A detailed description of dynamical transmission of COVID-19 is described in the flowchart (Fig.
1). Let   
,  be the total number of individuals in each sub-group, , , , at time t.
Each subpopulation is further the divided into Susceptible (   ), Exposed   ,
Asymptomatic (subclinical) infection  , Infectious pre-symptomatic (will eventually show
symptoms)   and Infectious symptomatic ( ), and Recovered (  ). Both   and
  are considered to be infectious virus carriers. We assume that individuals in   will
never show symptoms, while individuals in   develop into symptomatic classes ( ) after
a specified period of time. Mild symptomatic infections in classes ( ), may choose to either
isolate themselves at home (or other places). If the quarantine is respected well enough, these
infections will be fully isolated and, consequently, will not contribute to the spread of the virus.

Otherwise, they are still a source of infection until recovery. As the disease progresses, some
mild infections may become severe and require hospitalization. We include two further
compartments: the fully isolated (), and the hospitalized (H(t)) who are all severely affected.
It is assumed that neither of these compartments contribute to infection transmission.
Based on the classical SEIR framework, a household-based transmission model with age
structure will be proposed to describe the impact of school reopening on the development of the
epidemic. Considering that an infected person quarantined at home is interacting only with
family members, the number of contacts is limited, so we will use the standard incidence rate in
modelling.
Although home transmission is relatively strong, it only involves limited family members. To
reflect this, and capture disease transmission within families, we consider the population with
households.
For household members from WO, susceptible individuals    will be infected by infectious
individuals in the home  ,  ,    , and in the community. After school
reopening, the children and youth will face additional transmission risk from the school. Thus,
the adults may face the increase of home transmission risk due to the children and youth back to
school. The household from WFH is safe and not involved in the transmission of COVID-19.
Additionally, infections that are completely isolated will not be involved in transmission.
Before school reopening:
The household from WFH: all are susceptible, and isolated.
The household from WO:
•

Children and youth population (0-19): stay at home, facing the transmission risk from
household members and transmission risk in the community.

•

Adult population (>19): go to work, or other social activities, facing the infection risk
from community, and the risk from household members.

After school reopening:
The household from WFH: all are susceptible and isolated.
The household from WO:
•

Children and youth population: Go to school, facing the transmission risk from household
members and transmission risk in the community and school.

•

Adult population: Go to work (the proportion may increase due to the school reopening),
or other social activities, facing the infection risk from community, and the risk from
household members.

According to the infection and development process of the disease in the human body, at time t,
an individuals in a household can belong to one of the following categories: , , ,
 ,  , 7 or , or maybe recovered . Corresponding to each disease class, we
assign the number of individuals in each household to be , 8, 9, #, :, , ;, <, respectively and limit
- 8 - 9 - # - : -  - ; - < . Given the average
households to a size of ! such that !
household size is 2.4 in Toronto, we classify the household into two different type, 1 ,  
proportion of household without children( ! 2, 2 adults), and  proportion of household with
children ( ! 3, 2 adults, 1 child). Therefore, each household at most consists of ! different
categories of individuals. Based on the classification and combination of individuals in
324. The
households, all possible types of households in Toronto are >  - 8 + > 
total population in Toronto is N.
For the WFH household with  proportion, we assume they stay at home and individuals are
susceptible ( + 43 +  +  - 2 + 1 ,   +  5) and isolated. Since after 6 months epidemic,
if they have been infected, they will have shown symptoms or have already recovered. For the
WO household, the dynamics are determined by eight processes: within-household transmission;
disease progression from Exposed to Asymptomatic infection or Infection without symptoms;
disease progression from Infection without symptom to Infected with symptoms; recovery from
Asymptomatic infection; recovery from Infected with symptoms; hospitalization of Infected with

No birth, death, or immigration.
Based on the places of social activities, we divide it into within-household and outside-ofhousehold (school and community).
We divide the population into two groups: adults (marked by subscript ) and children and
youth (marked by subscript ). Also, due to the working status of adults, the households are
classified into working-from-home (marked by subscript  ), and working-outside-home
(marked by subscript ). The community is made up of adults and ( proportion of children
and youth from working-outside-home household. After school reopening, the school are
consisting of children and youth (marked by subscript ).
Each subpopulation is further the divided into Susceptible (   ), Exposed   ,
Asymptomatic (subclinical) infection   , Infectious pre-symptomatic (will eventually
show symptoms)   and Infectious symptomatic (  ).
Both   and   are infectious virus carriers. Individuals in   will never show
symptoms, while individuals in   develop into symptomatic classes (   ) after a
specified period of time.
Mild symptomatic infections (  ), may choose to either isolate themselves at home (or
other places). If the quarantine is respected well enough, these infections will be fully
isolated and, consequently, will not contribute to the spread of the virus. Otherwise, they are
still a source of infection until recovery.
Two further compartments for severe infections: the fully isolated (   ), and the
hospitalized (H(t)) who are all severely affected. Neither of these compartments contribute
to infection transmission.
All households contain  individuals and family members are homogeneously mixing i.e,
contacting each other randomly.
The households are classified into two types: with one child   3 , without children
  2.
The infection rate of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals to the
susceptible is the same among the household.
When no infections in a household, the family will be safe and will no longer be involved in
the transmission of COVID-19.
All children and youth in the household working-outside-home and part of the children and
youth in the household working-from-home will come back to school after school reopening.
These children and youth back to school completely need a period of time.
There are no symptomatic infections   in the initial state of school community every
day.
The everyday self-screen procedure may help detect infected children and youth who have
no symptoms.
Those infected children and youth with symptoms will be isolated.

3. Data
Reproduction numbers and numerical risk assessment
We calculate the reproduction numbers  based on the data of daily new cases by episode date
of Toronto with different age groups from Jul 31 to Nov 23 and classify the phases as follows,
considering the trend of data (  ) and the control measures that public health implemented.
Phase 1: Jul 31 – Sep 7
Phase 2: Sep 8 – Oct 2
Phase 3: Oct 3 – Nov 1
Phase 4: Nov 2 – Nov 23
Also, combined the results of 25 and our estimation in this model, we classify the control
measures into three different levels based on the public health reopening stages.

Parameter estimation and data fitting
Using the cumulative confirmed case data of adults and children and youth by episode date in
Toronto from Jul 31 to Nov 23, we fit our model by the least-square method to estimate the
parameters. The results show that our model fits very well with the Normalized Mean Square
Error (NMSE) = 0.995. Parameters are evaluated and presented in Table A4.

4. Control the risk in the school
Our findings suggest that school control measures, such as self-screening, limited attendance,
reduced class sizes, alternating in-person learning, reduced schooling days are effective in
reducing children and youth infections in schools. In-person attendance has the most obvious
impact on school infections. If 90% of children attend school in person (figure A3B) the daily
new cases (reaching 132 in December) was much higher compared to the scenario with only 10%
of attendees in school, showing only a maximum of 14 infections per day, dropped by 68.2%.
Reducing school opening days had the least impact on the cumulative infections of children and
adults by Dec18. When the school opening days are reduced from 5 days to 1 day a week, the
numbers of cases among children and adults population only decreased by 2.3% and 0.66%,
respectively (table A6). When the cohort size decreases from 30 to 10, the school's new
infections on Dec 18 decreased by 7.5%, and the total cumulative infections of children and
adults on Dec 18 decreased by 3.9% and 1.1%, respectively (table A6). However, the difference
is not visible when the self-screening efficiency is improved from 10% to 90%.

5. What will happen with the new strain virus
We consider the impact of the new strain on the number of cases (figure A4) until May 31, 2021.
We assume that the transmission probability of this new strain virus increase by 50%, and the
children will be more susceptible than before, with 70% susceptibility of adults. Also, we assume
it will be the main strain virus after 1 month of the new strain introduced. We define as baseline
the scenario with school closed, community opened under Stage 1 and old strain. We
immediately observe that in the worst case scenario (i.e. only the new strain is considered), the
cases increases exponentially in both subpopulations. In particular, under the same conditions as
the baseline, but with the new strain (figure A4, light blue dashed line), we observe that the
numer of case are three times greater than the ones generated by the old strain. If schools are
closed, but the community is opened under Stage 2 measures (orange dashed line), the number of
cases are 7 times higher. If both schools and community are opened under Stage 2, the increase
is slightly higher than 7.5 times.

Figure A4: The projection of cumulative cases with different senarioes and new strain.
Projection of cumulative cases in adults (A), and children and youth (B) up to May 31, 2021
under different opening strategies, considering the new virus strain, which increases the
children’s susceptibility. Green line: old strain, school are closed and community is opened
under Stage 1; dashed lines: new strain with closed schools and opened community, in stage 1,
(light blue), strain with closed schools and opened community, in stage 2, (orange), strain with
opened schools and community, in stage 2, (red).
