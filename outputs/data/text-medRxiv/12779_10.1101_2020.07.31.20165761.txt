Abstract
As schools prepare for the start of the Fall 2020 semester, many are struggling to make
decisions regarding whether or not to return to on-campus classes or whether to remain
fully online. Unfortunately, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ answer, and schools must
balance their own risks against the costs of remote learning. We present a tool that
integrates information about study body composition with predictions of COVID-19
infection rates in order to provide clarity and insight into the decisions facing colleges
and universities nationwide. Our tool is freely available and currently hosted at the
following location: https://bewicklab.shinyapps.io/covid-1/

Introduction
Beginning in March 2020 with the detection of early COVID-191,2 outbreaks in the U.S.3,
teaching institutions countrywide quickly shifted to remote online classes4-7. At the time,
there was a sense that this was a temporary stopgap measure – that students would return

to campus to resume face-to-face (f2f) classes in a few weeks, months or, at the very
least, by the start of the Fall 2020 semester. Since March, however, the spread of
COVID-19 within the U.S. has gotten worse. This has necessitated a variety of heavyhanded measures, including stay at home orders, self-quarantine, and implementing
legislature that promotes social distancing to limit disease spread. Despite this, cases of
COVID-19 continue to grow, particularly in regions in the U.S. South and Mid-West.
Indeed, within the last several weeks, there have even been renewed calls from experts
urging the country to shut down once again in order to get control of the epidemic8.

The continued impact of COVID-19 on public health across the country creates a high
level of uncertainty and debate over whether or not colleges and universities should
resume in-person classes for the Fall 2020 semester. At a minimum, continuity plans for
the fall semester must factor in student safety, educational impact, accessibility, finances,
and potential legal issues. On the financial side, for example, institutes of higher
education have already endured unprecedented losses as a result of the transition to
online learning in March. Compounding those losses with lost revenue due to lower
enrollment, a lack of on-campus housing, and potentially reduced tuition for online
classes would be devastating, and would result in lay-offs, furloughs and possibly even
the permanent closure of certain schools. In terms of educational costs, it is clear that
certain experiences – for example studio or lab classes – are more difficult in an on-line
format. And even for courses that can transition online relatively easily, issues of equity
remain. For example, lack of access to high quality internet is likely to

disproportionately impact marginalized populations, and this must be addressed to make
college courses fair, equitable and accessible to all.

While both financial and educational arguments suggest that a return to f2f classes for
Fall 2020 is optimal, the health and safety risks of doing so are extreme. Returning
students to campus would involve an unprecedented, mass, multistate migration across
the country. This would introduce COVID-19 from regional ‘hot-spots’ to locations with
lower levels of spread. It would also make any efforts to contact-trace almost impossible.
Not only will this have the effect of worsening the outbreak in regions where the virus
has, so far, been successfully contained, but also, it will pose a risk for students, faculty
and staff and even the broader members of local communities in towns and cities where
institutes of higher education exist. These health risks bring financial concerns of their
own. If, for example, faculty, staff or students suffer severe morbidity or mortality as a
result of an on-campus outbreak, lawsuits may be inescapable. As move-in dates quickly
approach in the following weeks, both students and administrators need to understand the
risks of returning to campus to make informed decisions going forward.

One of the challenges faced by students, colleges and universities in making the decision
to stay open or to move to remote learning is that all institutes of higher learning are
unique. They draw different numbers of students from different locations across the U.S.
and, as a consequence, the risks of one school opening for f2f classes are not necessarily
the same as the risks of another school opening. In order to provide students and
administrators with a more individualized assessment of the risks of student return to

campus, our team has developed the ‘COVID-19 Consequences of College Continuity
Calculator’. This tool provides estimates of the number of students expected to return to
campus carrying COVID-19, as well as the states from which those students are expected
to arrive. Specifically, our tool combines state-level demographic data from each college
or university with state-level predictions from Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
(IHME) models to determine COVID-19 infection rates in returning students. Our tool
has the ability to generate predictions unique to the geographical representativeness of
1440 school’s student bodies. These predictions provide an understanding of the potential
risks unique to individual universities based on student body size, geographic location,
and school opening strategy. Our hope is that this tool will provide a missing
informational component that can be used to factor into the informed decision making of
both administrators and students in returning to campus.
The online tool ‘COVID-19 Consequences of College Class Continuity Calculator’ is
currently available at the website:

Student enrollment data
Student enrollment data was obtained using the custom Python code ‘class_names.py’ to
webscrape data on college enrollment from the College Factual website. Briefly, we
collected a list 1440 of colleges and universities from:
https://www.collegefactual.com/search/.
For each school, we then used this list to pull the relative counts of the number of
students from each state from the following set of websites:
https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/university-name/student-life/diversity/chartgeographic-diversity.html
Next we rescaled these relative counts such that the total count summed to the population
of the full undergraduate student body at each school. Total undergraduate population
size was determined from the following set of websites:
https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/university-name
Both total student body size and state-by-state breakdowns of the student body are based
on enrollment during the 2017-2018 academic year, since this was the most recent data
available. Predictions are less likely to be accurate for any school that has experienced a
significant change in enrollment in the last 1-2 years, or schools with enrollment
significantly affected by COVID-19.

COVID-19 infection rates
Predictions for the number of COVID-19 infections in each state are based on IHME
models downloaded from the IHME: COVID-19 Projections website at
(http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads). These models provide lower

estimates, upper estimates and mean estimates of the number of daily deaths in each state.
To convert from daily deaths to new infections, we first assumed that it takes 19 days
between becoming infectious (symptomatic or a positive polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) test, hereafter referred to as an ‘active’ infection) and dying. Thus, we assumed
that all deaths on date t were due to new active infections on date t – 19. We then used
the infection fatality ratio (IFR) to convert from daily active infections that resulted in
death to total daily active infections. We did this by dividing the number of deaths 19
days later by the IFR. For the IFR, we used the current best estimate of IFR = 0.00659.
Finally, to convert from new active infections to infection rate, we divided state-level
predictions of active infections by the population size of each state (see equation (1)).
State populations were obtained from the following website (accessed on 07/21/2020):
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population
We used IHME mean estimates to provide our expected values, and IHME low and high
estimates to provide ranges.

Although we anticipate updating our online tool weekly to account for changes in IHME
estimates, all analysis in the current paper was based on data downloaded from the
IHME: COVID-19 Projection website on 07/30/2020, and reflects IHME predictions
updated on 07/14/2020. We did not take the most recent dataset, because lower bound
estimates were missing. However, estimates for the state of New Hampshire were
missing in the predictions for 07/14/2020; thus for New Hampshire, we used predictions
from 07/22/2020 (which lack a lower bound). The custom Python code

‘IHME_predictions_just_states_by_death.py’ was used to identify state-level IHME
predictions from downloaded datasets and to convert these to daily new active infections.

In our online tool, users are allowed to select between three different IHME models:
‘Mandates Easing’, ‘Current Projection’ and ‘Universal Masks’. Details regarding each
of these models can be found on the IHME: COVID-19 Projections website. Briefly,
‘Mandates Easing’ assumes continued easing of social distancing mandates and that these
are not re-imposed. ‘Current Projection’ assumes mandates are re-imposed for 6 weeks
whenever daily deaths rates reach 8 per million. Finally, ‘Universal Masks’ assumes 95%
mask use in public in every location, along with re-imposing social distancing mandates
when daily deaths rates reach 8 per million.

Probability that at least one student will return carrying COVID-19
The graphical user interface (GUI) for our online tool allows users to choose their school,
the IHME model scenario, m, that they would like to use, the expected date for student
return to campus, d, and estimates for both the incubation period (time between exposure
and becoming infectious), !! , and the infectious period (time between becoming
infectious and recovery or death), !" , of COVID-19. From this information, we first
calculate the predicted rate of infection (both active infections and infections still in the
incubation phase) in each state on date d, "#,% as follows:

where $(,%,) is the number of new active infections predicted by IHME model m on date t

disease up to !" days prior to returning to campus, since these people are expected to still
be infectious when they return. Likewise, we count all of the people who will develop
the disease up to !! days after returning to campus, since these people will have been
exposed to COVID-19 in their home states prior to returning to campus. Using equation

Effectiveness of proposed quarantine and testing strategies
A number of schools are proposing some combination of quarantine and testing in order
to mitigate the introduction of COVID-19 on campus. To help assess the effects of these
actions on the risk of COVID-19 during return to campus, our tool includes a prediction
of the number of student infections that will be missed based on a school’s selected
quarantine and testing protocol. Specifically, our GUI allows users to select the
mandatory quarantine length, Q, the percentage of students that will be tested, 1, and the
estimated false-negative rate, 2, for their chosen testing method. The expected number of
COVID-19 cases that will be missed is then be given by:

administered, and "50,#,% is the probability of a student having an active Covid-19

go undetected by available tests. In addition, a fraction of active COVID-19 infections
also go undetected, based on the percentage of students tested, as well as the number of
tests that give false-negatives, and thus fail to detect active cases.

Parameters and model predictions
Unless otherwise noted, we assume an infectious period of 10 days, in keeping with
recent Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations10. We also assume an
incubation period of 5 days11 and a return to campus date of 08/15/2020. In what
follows, we use these assumptions to explore the consequences of on-campus return
across all 1440 institutes of higher education in our database. Specifically, we examine
the number of students returning as COVID-19 carriers, both in absolute terms and in
terms of rates of infection across the student body. We then examine how these
outcomes depend on student body size, geographic location, and school opening date.

Results
We begin by exploring trends across all colleges and universities in our database. For the
worst-case scenario (‘Mandates Easing’), we find a mean(median) of 33.50(9) students
returning to campus as COVID-19 carriers. This includes a mean(median) of 22.51(6)
students returning with active cases, and a mean(median) of 10.99(3) students returning
still in the incubation phase. In terms of incidence rates, we find a mean(median) of
4.8(3.5) cases per 1000 students, with 3.2(2.3) of these cases being active and 1.6(1.1) of
these cases being in the incubation phase. Overall, the mean(median) probability of at

Results for the other two IHME scenarios are shown in Table 1.

For all three scenarios, the distribution of cases across schools was highly skewed, with
most schools having <10 COVID-19 infections among the returning students, while a few
schools had hundreds to more than 1000 expected cases (see Fig 1a, see also SI Fig. S1).
This was at least partly driven by the wide range of school sizes, with larger schools
having significantly more cases than smaller schools (Fig 1b and c, see also Fig. S1).

Another important factor driving differences in COVID-19 infections across schools was
school location. Even though colleges and universities draw students from across the
country, higher proportions of students frequently come from locations within state, and
this is particularly true of state schools. Thus, we considered absolute numbers of
infections and infection incidence rates among returning students as a function of state
(see Fig 2, see also SI Fig. S2). Not surprisingly, states in ‘hot-spots’, for example Texas
and Florida had higher numbers of students returning as COVID-19 carriers as compared
to states with less severe outbreaks, for example West Virginia.

One of the risks of oncampus classes in Fall 2020
is the mass migration of
students across the country.

cases that are from out-of-state students. Results are shown for the
‘Mandates Easing’ scenario.

This will disperse students
from hot-spot regions to

regions with controlled or mostly controlled outbreaks, exacerbating efforts at disease
containment. For this reason, we also considered the states most at risk of introductions
from other locations. This is a function of both the degree to which schools within a state
draw from out-of-state student populations, as well as the level of outbreak in-state. This
is shown in Fig. 3. As expected, states like West Virginia and Alaska that are not
currently seeing high levels of COVID-19 infection are negatively impacted by the
decision to move students back to campus. Meanwhile, states like Texas are not

impacted at all – indeed, Texas is responsible for many of the imported cases to other
states.

In order to mitigate the risk of f2f classes in Fall 2020, many schools are contemplating a
delayed start. Therefore, we considered the impact that this would have on infection rates
among returning students. This is shown in Fig. 4 for all three IHME scenarios.

Values are reported as percent changes in the number of

different IHME scenarios: (A) Mandates Easing, (B)

Here we assume a five week delay, consistent with current planning at Clemson
University, where classes have been delayed from an original 08/17/2020 start date to an
09/21/2020 start date. Notice that states are colored by percent change – thus, for
example, Montana has a large increase in all three maps. This is not because Montana
has a particularly large increase in absolute numbers of infected students over the delay
period, but rather, because infection rates on 08/17/2020 are very low, such that even
modest increases in infection rates give dramatic percent changes. Clearly, whether or

not a delay is helpful is strongly contingent on how public health measures are
implemented. For the ‘Mandates Easing’ scenario, there was an overall 10.15% increase
in the rate of infection in returning students (averaged across states; there was a 1.70%
increase when averaged directly across schools), suggesting that a five week delay would
not be beneficial and, if anything, could be detrimental. However, in the ‘Current
Projection’ scenario, there was a 6.54% decrease (averaged across states; there was an
11.57% decrease when averaged directly across schools) in the rate of infection,
providing hope that a delay in return to campus could be beneficial. Even more
encouragingly, in the ‘Universal Masks’ scenario, there was a 36.53% decrease (when
averaged across states; there was a 40.51% decrease when averaged directly across
schools) in the rate of infection. Thus a delayed start to on-campus classes could be very
effective if mask adoption can be successfully implemented nationwide.

Discussion
We have developed an online tool that can help both students and administrators estimate
the level of risk of returning to f2f classes for Fall 2020. For any given school, our tool
predicts the number of returning students who will be carrying COVID-19. This estimate
is broken down into students who have an active infection, as well as students who are in
the incubation phase. The distinction between active infection and incubation phase is
important, since only active infections are likely to be detected by a polymerase chain

still incubating the virus will be allowed into the community with the ability to spread
COVID-19.

To account for mitigation strategies, our tool enables users to select quarantine and
testing combinations to see how this will impact the risk of re-opening campuses. As
suggested above, we assume that all infections that are in the incubation phase evade
detection. To prevent these infections from being missed, mandatory quarantine is
necessary. For active infections, we assume that a certain number are missed as a result
of incomplete testing of the student body, as well as imperfect testing results. Again, the
goal of this component of our tool is to help administrators decide on the best balance of
risks versus financial considerations based on their testing capacity, ability to quarantine
students, etc.

While we find very few schools that have little to no risk of COVID-19 infections, we do
find that most schools will have <10 imported cases. There are, however, other schools
with large numbers of infections in the returning student body. Not surprisingly, most of
these schools are located in ‘hot-spot’ states. For example, under the ‘Mandates Easing’
scenario, eight out of ten schools with the highest number of students returning infected
are in Texas, while the other two are in Florida (1. Texas A&M University – College
Station (1009), 2. University of Central Florida (744), 3. The University of Texas at
Austin (743), 4. University of Houston (713), 5. Texas State University (662), 6. The

Texas at San Antonio (510)). These are also primarily state schools, with large student
bodies. Whether or not re-opening is a viable strategy for these types of schools remains
an open question, and probably depends on the capacity of these schools to test and
quarantine incoming students.

Although our tool is useful for helping to guide decision-making regarding f2f classes in
Fall 2020, there are a few caveats. First, our models are based on student enrollment from
the 2017-2018 year, since this is the most recently available dataset. Any school that has
seen a significant change (increase, decrease, or change in composition across states) in
enrollment over the last two years may find that predictions are less accurate. In
addition, our tool is based on IHME predictions. Thus, the accuracy of our models hinge
on the accuracy of the IHME predictions. Preliminary results suggest relative agreement
between our predictions and current testing results. For example, testing at West Virginia
University (https://presidentgee.wvu.edu/messages/phased-return-to-morgantowncampus-july-27) suggests a ~0.2% positive rate, which is commensurate with our
estimated 0.17% positive rate. For this estimate we assumed a start date 08/30/2020,
counted only active infections, and assumed an infectious period of 10 days, an
incubation period of 5 days, 100% testing and a false negative rate of 0%.

Beyond the accuracy of the underlying models, our tool relies on a few additional
assumptions. First, our tool allows users to pick the infectious period and incubation
period. Although we preset these parameters at values consistent with CDC
recommendations10 and existing research studies11, users are free to alter both, and this

could impact predictions. We allow user input on these parameters because much about
COVID-19 remains unknown. By allowing flexibility, our tool enables users to assess
risk based on ‘best-case’ and ‘worst-case’ scenarios. In reality, both infectious period
and incubation period are likely variable across the population. This brings up another
assumption of our tool. Currently, our model assumes a fixed window for both of these
parameters (as well as the delay between becoming infectious and dying). In a future
rendition, we anticipate building in population-level variability in both infectious period
and incubation period. This will improve predictions, as well as allow users to assess the
importance of outliers – for instance students who shed infectious viral particles for >>10
days, or who take longer to develop an active infection after being exposed (which would
require a longer quarantine to prevent detection evasion). An additional assumption of
our model is that outbreaks are evenly distributed at the state level. Clearly this is not
true. Indeed, some counties, even within hot-spot states, may be relatively virus-free.
Students returning from these locations do not pose the same challenges as students
returning from counties, cities or towns with high levels of COVID-19 infection.
Currently, however, we do not have data on county-level enrollment at all of the institutes
of higher education in our database. Further, IHME predictions are made at the statelevel. That said, IHME anticipates building in county-level predictions in the near future,
and this would facilitate increased spatial resolution in our model as well. Finally, our
model does not account for international students or graduate students, as well as
infections acquired during transit. Infections acquired during transit could include
exposures as students travel, by car, through hot-spot cities on their way back to college.
Even more likely, though, it could include exposures in airports, on buses and on trains,

where there will be high levels of mixing among people from different locations across
the U.S. and the world more broadly. This is almost certain to increase predicted
infection rates, particularly at schools with high enrollment of out-ot-state students who
are likely to return to campus by plane.

Despite the caveats, we hope that our tool proves useful in guiding decisions for the
upcoming semester. Clearly, difficult choices are being made across the country as
schools attempt to balance the importance of student education, financial viability, equity
and access, public health and student and staff safety in the face of unprecedented
challenges. Ultimately, these decisions are likely to vary based on a range of factors that
determine the risks of f2f classes, as well as both the costs and benefits of remote
learning. Because these decisions, and even the risks that they rest on, are not ‘one-sizefits-all’, our tool provides tailored estimates based on the incoming student body, the
school location and the school capacity for mitigation via testing and quarantine.
