ABSTRACT

49

Background: Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has caused significant global outbreaks outside

50

China. Many countries have closed their borders with China and performed obligate protective

51

procedures, however, this disease was still rising worldwide. In this report, we aim to identify

52

transmission patterns from China to other countries, along with describing the disease control

53

situation of countries.

54

Methods: We retrospectively collected information about infected cases with COVID-19 from

55

WHO situation reports, official notification websites of health ministries and reliable local

56

newspapers from each country. Descriptive and cluster analysis was performed to describe the

57

transmission characteristics while the logistic regression test was used to estimate the risk factors

58

for the occurrence of an infected individual with an unknown source.

59

Results: A total of 446 infected cases were recorded from 24 countries outside China until 12

60

February 2020, with the number of reported infected cases were doubled every 3.08 ± 0.35 days

61

(range from 2.6 to 3.9). Besides the spread from China, the transmission was originated from

62

sub-endemic countries (Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, France, German). Out of 6

63

countries got occurrence of an infected individual with unknown source and possible potential

64

factors contributed to this occurrence was a time of epidemic circulating, number of patients and

65

number of clusters when the occurrence still has not happened, and notably, the unreported

66

situation of Chinese tourists’ information.

67

Conclusions: The situational reports of each country about COVID-19 should be more detailed

68

mentioning the transmissions routes with keeping contact tracing of the unknown cases to

69

increase the control of this disease.

BACKGROUND
Novel coronavirus is a new strain of the previously discovered Coronaviridae family, a member

100

of RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales which own spiky projections on their outer surfaces that

101

resemble the shape of a crown, or "corona" in Latin1. They are zoonotic viruses infecting mainly

102

birds and mammals, in addition to humans. Human coronavirus infections are mostly mild,

103

however, in the past two decades, two beta-coronaviruses; the Severe Acute Respiratory

104

Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

105

(MERS-CoV) have infected more than 10,000 patients over a potentially short period of time 1-5.

106

With mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV, respectively, they are one

107

of the most devastating epidemics all over the world6.

108

On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of severe acute pneumonia with unknown etiology occurred

109

in Wuhan with people who attended a wild animal and seafood market in China. China

110

discovered at this time a new strain of coronavirus resembles SARS-CoV and has informed the

111

world health organization (WHO) about this new catastrophe and new countries have taken

112

obligate procedures to prevent the virus from spread abroad 7,8. However, Multiple countries of

113

almost all continents including the USA, Vietnam, Germany and Australia have reported

114

confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-29. COVID-19 possesses an exceptional ability of transmission

115

and no specific treatment for it has been reported. Infected patients are managed with supportive

116

care, but antiviral medications and combination treatment have been reported to be used 10. The

117

clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported as fever, dyspnea, cough, abdominal

118

distress, and in severe cases, it could lead to complications such as acute respiratory distress

119

syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema and multiorgan failure11.

120

Furthermore, efforts in measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and

121

containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters to prevent extensive community spread.

122

Recently, an asymptomatic transmission has been reported in many countries including Germany,

123

South Korea, China12-14; WHO has reported that the transmission occurred easily by face to face

124

through coughing, sneezing, contact with secretions of infected people like nasal and oral

125

droplets, tears or substantially by fecal-oral route15. The basic reproduction rate of COVID-19

126

estimated at 3.28 representing the highly contagious transmissibility of this disease putting us on

127

a great challenge for containment this largely infectious disease outside China 16. In this report,

128

we aimed to investigate the epidemiological importance of clustering the COVID-19 confirmed

129

cases outside China to increase the awareness of these countries to develop more appropriate

130

surveillance system ways to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and contact trace of their unknown

131

cases.

132
133

METHODS

134

Data collection and search strategy

135

We initially obtained data from a manual search of clinically confirmed COVID-19 through

136

ProMED, WHO, CDC, ministries of health of different countries press releases, journal case

137

reports like Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and local news. We used

138

since then many search keywords to get these data including ‘novel coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’,

139

‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘2019-nCoV’, ‘cluster’, ‘transmission’ and ‘contact tracing’ ‘Wuhan’ and others.

140

The data acquired have been sorted according to demographic characteristics such as age, sex,

141

country, history of contact or travel, announcement date and the transmission clusters. February

142

12, 2020 was the last date we have done these searches.

143

Sources reliability

144

We have measured the reliability of our sources using The Journal of the American Medical

145

Association (JAMA) four benchmarks published in 1997. The four criteria involved the

146

authorship (the information of authors or writers and their affiliation should be provided),

147

attribution (the sources have to list their references prominently), disclosure (ownership, funding

148

source, advertisement and conflict of interests should be obvious for readers) and currency (the

149

date of publishing and updating contents should be posted)17.

150

Ethical condition

151

All data have been acquired from online sources and governments` websites without any direct

152

contact data from patients.

153

Definition of epidemiology of infectious clusters and doubling time

154

We defined the transmission clusters epidemiologically into four main types, A, B, C, and D,

155

based on the infectious source and risk of an outbreak. A cluster was classified into group A if the

156

primary pathogen had a history of traveling to China or have been in contact with foreigners

157

abroad outside countries, who were later confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection. Because it was

158

impossible to determine who exactly spread the disease in the case of an infected group returned

159

from China, each of the patients in the group would be considered as an independent primary

160

pathogen and established an independent cluster. Group B involved clusters that patients without

161

traveling to China but got local contact with Chinese tourists. Due to the information of Chinese

162

tourists was not disclosed and such tourists were not reported as infected cases, we considered

163

clusters in group B to be at higher risk of an outbreak than group A. Groups C and D, at more

164

risk, included clusters where the source of infection could not be identified. While patients in a

165

cluster C were involved with a specific area, such as a church, a conference, etc., information of

166

patients in clusters D remained completely unknown.

167

The doubling time in our study is defined as the time required for the number of reported cases to

168

double. It was calculated based on the formula: N = N0.2𝑇 . Because we only could record the

169

date of diagnosis (not the date of expose), the value hence only partially reflected the rate of

170

disease transmission.

171

Statistical analysis

172

Descriptive demographic and cluster analysis have been conducted inclusively for this dataset.

173

The missing data have been considered as unreported due to some governments didn`t reveal

174

these data to protect the personality of their patients. Logistic regression then was performed to

175

determine relationships between potential factors and the occurrence of an infected with

176

unknown source, with the significant value chosen was < 0.05.

RESULTS
Demographic characteristic of infected patients

181

We have identified 446 cases from 24 countries confirmed with COVID-19 infection outside

182

China. The median (IQR) number of reported cases doubling time was 3.08 ± 0.35 (range from

183

2.6 to 3.9) days and recorded the highest increase of reports (n = 113) between 10-Feb and 11-

184

Feb 2020, mostly from cases of Diamond Princess (Figure 1)18. Concisely, the most affected

185

country with the biggest number of infected patients was Singapore with a total number of 50

186

since the beginning of the outbreak up to February 12, 2020 (Table 1)19. The first case outside

187

China was reported in Thailand on January 13, 202020. Further details of the sequences of these

188

cases in each country are presented in the Supplementary document.

189

Approximately, 57% of the COVID-19 infected patients were males compared to 43% female

190

patients. The median (IQR) age was 42 (32-56), and the youngest infected patient was a three-

191

month old child from Vietnam21. All patients survived up to this date (February 12, 2020), and

192

some were even discharged from the hospital except for one case who died on February 2, 2020.

193

The patient was a 44-year old male passenger coming from Wuhan to Philippines22. Other

194

demographic characteristics of the included patients were presented in Table 2.

195

Transmission outside China

196

A total of 214 transmission clusters from 446 patients were determined. There were 178 clusters

197

(83.2%) that were involved with China and 12 clusters (5.6%) were spread from other sub-

198

endemic countries (Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, France, German). Spain was the only

199

country in which the spread of COVID-19 from China was completely indirect, and Korea

200

represented the most counties have indirect transmission. More details of these transmissions

201

were shown in Figure 2.

202

Table 3 showed a summary of the size and the type of clusters. The biggest cluster recognized

203

was the Diamond Cruise ship, with a total of 175 infected patients18,24-26, followed by the cluster

204

in Germany (13 patients), Singapore (9 patients), France, Viet Nam, UK, Korea (6 patients)

205

19,21,27

206

respectively 182 (85.0%), 9 (4.2%), 10 (4.7%), 13 (6.1%). When approaching group, A, B, we

207

found that 168 non-transmissible clusters (1-patient cluster), 18 clusters confirmed the local

208

transmission between primary pathogen and local people, and 5 clusters recognized the

209

transmission between local people.

210

At the national level, out of 24 countries infected with COVID-19, the occurrence of an infected

211

individual with unknown source happened in 6 countries (Australia, Germany, Japan, Singapore,

212

Thailand, UAE). Summarily, there were 13 countries that local human-human transmission

213

began, with the number of local transmission (F2 and F3) range from 5.6% in Malaysia to 55.6%

214

in UK from identified primary pathogen (F1). Other information has been summarized in Table

. Notably, Results also have shown that the number of clusters of Group A, B, C and D was

216

Occurrence of an infected individual with unknown source

217

Table 5 showed the associated factor with the occurrence of an infected individual with

218

unknown source. Time period from the first case reported until Feb 12 was related with

219

increasing of the risk (p = 0.044) (OR: 0.76) [95% CI: 0.58-0.99]. Notably, countries which was

220

unreported information of Chinese tourists was associated with highly significant risk of

221

occurrence event (p = 0.001). We also detected other factors that can contribute on the situations

222

like the number of control patients (p = 0.032) (OR: 0.89) [95%CI: 0.81-0.99] and number of

223

control clusters (p = 0.017) (OR: 0.85) [95%CI: 0.74-0.97].

224

DISCUSSION

225

The overview of our study has undoubtedly affirmed that the number of patients diagnosed with

226

the newly discovered coronavirus has continued to increase every day, affecting many countries

227

all over the world. This virus unfortunately showed a very interactive easily transportation from

228

person to person. Liu et. al. has detected the mean reproductive rate (R0) of severe acute

229

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) estimated around 3.28 compared to 3 in

230

SARS28,29. However, some studies have been gone far and estimated R0 of this new virus to

231

reach above 6 in average indicating the hard situation of the world for the inability to control this

232

emergent disease30,31. Therefore, many countries have put restrictive measures on travelers

233

coming from China to limit the spread of the disease among their populations. In China, the

234

authorities decided to lock down many cities to control the disease which caused people of

235

different nationalities to seek their home return. As a result, the epidemiology and transmission

236

of the disease are vague concerning any possible transmission by asymptomatic patients as the

237

incubation period of COVID-19 is 14 days. On the other hand, a study reported the doubling

238

time of the outbreak inside China to be 7.4 days on January 22, 2020 6. The mean doubling time

239

we calculated here was every 3.08 ± 0.35 days outside China (Figure 1). However, we could not

240

compare both estimates to each other, and other similar outbreaks due to lack of sufficient data of

241

expose time in our sources unlike they had. Therefore, we couldn`t either assess R0, besides,

242

further investigations are needed regarding this concern as this rate was likely to be increased

243

with time.

244

Currently in this study we have attempted for more investigation and clustering the

245

epidemiology of the population from outside China who have been related to the outbreak until

246

February 12, 2020. To this date, 446 cases were reported internationally in 24 countries with the

247

highest number of patients among the Singaporean population, and the lowest in Belgium 32,

248

Cambodia33, Finland34, Nepal35, Sri Lanka36.and Sweden37 which reported only one case each.

249

The huge number of infected patients is due to the Diamond Princess cruise (n = 174) which was

250

locked down on February 3, by the Japanese authorities after COVID-19 was positively

251

confirmed in Hong Kong Chinese man 24-27. Without these cases, Singapore would have the

252

largest record of on-land confirmed cases of COVID-19 (n = 50)19 (Table 1). The primary

253

transmission (Group A) represented the majority that brought the primary pathogen (n = 168).

254

Moreover, we did more subgrouping of these cases to know where most of cases mostly came

255

from and found the majority of them are Chinese people who recently returned from China (Aa)

256

(n = 159), however, some cases recognized from other sub-endemic countries (Ab) (n = 9) as in

257

Japan38, Singapore39, France40, Germany41, Thailand42 and Malaysia43. highlighting that the

258

governments should not only focus on checking people from China, but also, in countries that

259

reported COVID-19 infected cases. In addition, we noticed some of the reported cases had no

260

history of travel to China, where the outbreak took place but had been in close contact with

261

Chinese people, suggesting person to person transmission (F2) which is similar to the (SARS) 44

262

and (MERS)45 outbreaks in 2003 and 2013, respectively (Table 3, Figure 2).

263

The primary cases who infected other persons later (F1) were greatest in Thailand (n = 26),

264

Singapore (n = 24), and Japan (n = 19) which is suggestive of the poor tracking the patients

265

entering the country (Table 4). In Thailand, a taxi driver was reported to have been infected on

266

January 28, 2020. The patient had no history of travel to China but was in contact with a Chinese

267

tourist which the first case of a person to person transmission in the country46. Moreover,

268

transmission with difficulty in detecting the source of infection, and infections with no detectable

269

source (Group C and D) (either not reported or cannot be detected) was presented in some

270

countries. In Australia, UAE and Germany reported 1, 3 and 1 respectively in these two groups,

271

while Asia recorded the highest number of such cases reaching 11 cases in Singapore, 3 in Japan

272

(Table 4). These are serious numbers and can be misleading as suggestive of the emergence of

273

the disease in these counties with no transmission from China being reported. However, they

274

were estimated in the early period, so they were not always reflected the current statements as

275

some country may gain the ability to find the links of their cases like Singapore latterly but still

276

give some predictions of future events in other countries like what happened later in Japan and

277

Germany. To note, we try to develop a new way of predictions and rapid judgmental tools of

278

ongoing daily situations report for those countries who care to identify and clarify their present

279

conditions. Therefore, authorities should exert more effort in reporting all cases in an evidence-

280

based manner. The earliest case to be reported outside China was in Thailand on January 13,

281

2020 who had been to China lately20. Besides, the only patient that died from COVID-19 from

282

outside China was reported in Philippine on February 2, 202022. However, the Death numbers

283

were likely to be increased in the following days because of the continuously increasing numbers

284

of confirmed infected patients.

285

The pathophysiology of this COVID-19 has not powerfully known, but Sohrabi et. al. said that

286

most of the transmission occurred in the symptomatic period with increasing some reporting of

287

asymptomatic transferring cases47. Subsequently human to human transmission was reported in

288

Vietnam48, Japan49 and USA50. Some cases are asymptomatic12,51,52 due to the 2-week incubation

289

period of the virus which makes it hard to detect these cases, further, possible transmission of the

290

virus to other contacts is easy. In addition, a Vietnamese case was reported with normal clinical

291

findings and mild symptoms53. We couldn`t report these findings due to non-adequate

292

information in the majority of cases. Nonetheless, we kept tracked to know about the transferring

293

patterns of this disease in different countries, then we found the direct transmission ratio from

294

Chinese people (F1 to F2) has recorded the highest in the UK (55.6%), Vietnam (44.6%) and

295

Republic of South Korea (24%) while the indirect local ratio (F2 to F3) revealed in South Korea

296

(33.3%) and Vietnam (14.3%) can represent a hazard ratio of outbreak occurrence but still

297

remained non-significant (p > 0.05) (Table 4, Table 5). However, the impact of unreported

298

Chinese cases in out of control countries was a significantly high risk of the outbreak (p <

299

0.001). The time of announcement of cases and the number of control patients or clusters are still

300

risk factors to produce pandemic disease (p < 0.05) (Table 5). The cluster size didn`t show a

301

significant this risk attribution (p > 0.05), in spite of that, this assessment has been made in the

302

early stage when the super-spreader factors haven`t grown yet. Consequently, healthcare officials

303

must put restrictive measures at all levels for rapid detection of the virus on people coming from

304

China or those countries which became lastly an epicenter of this disease.

305

Eventually, we would like to recommend the diagnostic measures of the COVID-19 to be more

306

developed. Mostly we used RT-PCR techniques according to the WHO recommendations54.

307

Samples were effectively positive for the virus from the upper and lower respiratory tract 6, and

308

stool55. Furthermore, the virus was detected in the serum of severely ill patients in China 56.

309

However, Ai et. al. had another opinion for considering the chest computed tomography (CT) as

310

a primary tool for investigation57. He foresaw that the CT scan was much easier and more

311

practical. Another study suggested a combination of both techniques when RT-PCR results were

312

negative but it should be in highly suspicious persons 58. We also agreed on prevention of the

313

outbreak should include suspected and confirmed cases isolation, rapid monitoring to the

314

contacts with these cases, and preparing the healthcare facilities and training the medical stuffs

315

for dealing with such cases. Health education of people who have been in close contact with

316

infected patients for rapid presentation at nosocomial procedures is crucial in controlling the

317

outbreak. Besides, advising susceptible individuals about the importance of hygiene and wearing

318

personal protective equipment (PPE), and staying away from infected or suspected patients is

319

important to prevent person-to-person transmission59,60.

320

While providing more insight into how COVID-19 spread worldwide, highlighting the

321

importance of coordination between clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state,

322

and federal levels, as well as the need for rapid assessment of clinical information related to the

323

care of patients with this emerging infection, it was undoubtedly that there still were several

324

limitations to our study. Incomplete data especially expose time and incubated period of the

325

infected cases, as most of the reports were published as news reports, Ministries of Health press

326

releases with a short description. Furthermore, investigation hence was needed to gather more

327

knowledge about this disease.

328

CONCLUSION

329

In this study, we reported the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outside China. Further
