A SURPRISING FORMULA FOR THE SPREAD OF
COVID-19 UNDER AGGRESSIVE MANAGEMENT
IVAN CHEREDNIK

†

Abstract. We propose an algebraic-type formula that describes
with high accuracy the total number of detected infections for the
Covid-19 pandemic in many countries. Our 2-phase formula can
be used as a powerful forecasting tool. It is based on the author’s
new theory of momentum management of epidemics; Bessel functions are employed. Its 3 parameters are the initial transmission
rate, reﬂecting the viral ﬁtness and ”normal” frequency of contacts
in the infected areas, and the intensity of prevention measures at
phases 1, 2. Austria, Brazil, Germany, Japan, India, Israel, Italy,
the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the USA are considered, including the second wave in the latter. The forecasting
software is provided as a supplement (any groups of countries).

1. Our approach and main ﬁndings. A surprising 2-phase formula
describing very well the total number of detected infections of Covid-19
during practically for the whole period of the spread in many countries
is the main result. We model momentum management of epidemics ,
which can be deﬁned as a system of measures aimed at reducing the
epidemic spread by regulating their intensity on the basis of the latest
total numbers of infections. The ”hard measures”, such as detection
and prompt isolation of infected people and closing the places where the
spread is the most likely, combined with prompt response to the current
numbers of cases, ensure a relatively fast saturation. Assuming that the
saturation is reached, the second phase is when the hard measures are
reduced. The accuracy of our formula is even more surprising for this
phase, since many political, economic and other factors are involved.
The precision of our 2-phase formula practically in all countries that
reached phase 2 seems a real discovery. The recurrence of any kind
due to abandoning the measures is not considered. The readers mostly
interested in the ﬁnal formulas and particular countries can go directly
to Section 5; Section 6 is on the auto-forecasting for the USA.

Focus on risk-management. We attribute the surprising similarity of
the curves of the total numbers of detected cases in many countries to
the uniformity of the measures employed and the ways people react
to the data. These numbers mostly reﬂect symptomatic cases and
are frequently underreported. However, as far as they inﬂuence the
decisions of the authorities in charge and our own behavior, they proved
to be suﬃcient, a strong conﬁrmation of our ”sociological” approach.
We see 3 basic types of management. The countries in the ﬁrst group
are determined to reach ”double digit numbers” of new daily infections.
The second group is when the reduction of hard measures begins upon
the ﬁrst signs of the stabilization of the daily numbers, which can be
still very high; this is the switch to the (AB)–mode or (B)-mode in
our model. The third group of countries is where ”hard” measures are
not employed systematically, which can be due to a variety of reasons,
including insuﬃcient capacities or political decisions. Some measures
are always in place, for instance, self-isolation of those who think that
they can be infected. Their prompt requests for medical help can work
well in the countries with solid health-care systems, like Sweden. Also,
travel restrictions, common everywhere, deﬁnitely reduce the spread.
The general theory remains essentially unchanged from its ﬁrst posted
variant (April 13). However only now all its main features are conﬁrmed to occur practically. For instance, both Bessel-type solutions appeared necessary to model the spread in Brazil, Italy, Germany, Japan
and some other countries. Also, the log(t)–saturation of solutions of
type (B) is the key to ”ending the epidemic” for phase 2.
Power law of epidemics. The simplest equations for the spread of
communicable diseases result in exponential growth of the number of
infections, which is mostly applicable to the initial stages of epidemics.
See e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4] here and below and [5] about some perspectives with
Covid-19. We focus on the middle stages, where the growth is practically no greater than some power functions in time, which obviously
requires a diﬀerent approach and diﬀerent equations.
Also, the logistic models of the spread, as well as their SIR, SID
generalizations, assume that the number of infections is comparable
with the whole population, which we do not impose. Major epidemics
were not really of this kind during the last 100 years, mostly due to
better disease control worldwide and general life improvements.
The reality now is the power-type growth of total number of infections U (t) after a possible short period of exponential growth, Covid-19
included. Our approach is based on this assumption. We start with
the equation dU (t)/dt = c U (t)/t , where the basic transmission rate c
here is a combination of the transmission strength of the virus and the
”normal” frequency of the contacts in the infected place.

Generally, dU (t)/dt is essentially is proportional to U (t)−U (t−p),
where p is the period when the infected people spread the virus in the
most intensive way. This diﬀerence is really proportional to U (t)/t
if the growth of U (t) is basically linear. It models well the growth of
U (t) even without this assumption. The reduction of our contacts with
infected people over time seems the most likely reason for this.
Let us try to clarify this. If the total number of cases growths linearly,
i.e. when the number of new daily infections is constant, this is not
really a ”trigger” for us psychologically. However, we react strongly if
the growth is parabolic or so.
Also, if someone wants to ”see” the current trend of the epidemic
using only the total number of infections to date, then U (t)/t is the
best way. The equation dU (t)/dt = c U (t)/t immediately gives that
U (t) = Ctc for some constant C, i.e. results in the power growth. Such
”sociological approach” to the epidemic spread is quite natural in our
work: the active managements of epidemics is clearly of sociological
nature. This is diﬀerent from other power laws for infectious diseases;
compare e.g. with [3].
There can be other mechanisms for the ”power law”, including the
biological ones. Self-isolation of infected species is common ... unless
for rabies ; it can grow over time and can depend on the intensity of
the spread. The replication processes for viruses is another reduction
mechanism, but this is well beyond this article.
This is how we behave before (regardless of) any protection measures. After the management began, U (t) is not ∼ tc anymore; Bessel
functions begin to control the spread till the ”technical saturation”,
provided that the measures are ”hard”. They can soften after the
turning point, or what looks like a turning point. We can model this
too; our formula describes the second phase with very high accuracy.
Some details. The full theory is presented in [6]. It is strongly related
to that from [7]; the diﬀerential equations are the same. We begin there
with modeling the news impact over time The ”news impact” is absolutely relevant here: the discussion of the epidemic by the authorities
in charge and everywhere is one of the key factors inﬂuencing our understanding the situation and the reduction of our contacts. Similarly,
the active prevention measures are analogous to momentum trading .
The coeﬃcient c is one of the two main mathematical parameters of
our theory. It can be seen as follows.
Before the prevention measures are implemented, approximately it
reveals itself in the growth ∼ tc of the total number of detected infec.
tions, where t is time. Mostly, c ≈ 2.2 – 2.6 for Covid-19. This is after a
short period of the exponential growth. Upon the active management,

the growth quickly drops to tc/2 , i.e. becomes essentially linear, which
is part of our theory in [6]. Importantly our u(t) and w(t) behave as
∼ tc for relatively small t, so Bessel functions can be used very well to
model the initial stages, not only the middle period.
Ending epidemics. The ”power law” is only a starting point of our
analysis. The main problem is of course to ”add” here some mechanisms ending epidemics and those preventing their possible recurrence.
These are major challenges, biologically, psychologically, sociologically
and mathematically. One can expect this megaproblem to be well beyond the power law itself, but we demonstrate that mathematically
there is a path based on Bessel functions. The power growth alone
does not lead to any saturation, the Bessel functions are needed.
We are of course fully aware of the statistical nature of the problem,
but the formula for the growth of the total number of infections we
propose works almost with an accuracy of physics laws. This is very
surprising for such stochastic processes as epidemics.
An important outcome of our modeling is that the measures of ”hard
type”, like detecting and isolating infected people and closing the places
where the spread is almost inevitable, are the key for ending an epidemic. The most aggressive ”hard way” is to employ such measures
strictly proportionally to the current total numbers of detected infections, not to its derivative of any kind.
For instance, if the number of infections doubles during some period,
then testing-detection must be increased 4–fold. Similarly, when we
approach the saturation, where the number of new detected infections
becomes close to zero, the ”hard response” is to continue testing linearly
for some time, i.e. performing the same number of tests every day in
spite of almost zero number of new infections.
By contrast, the ”soft response” is as follows. We act upon the
current average number of infections, instead of the absolute numbers,
i.e. the response is slower. For instance, testing and other measures
will practically stop when there are no new ”cases”. If ”hard” measures
are not used, then mathematically the epidemic will never reach the
saturation. However coupling the ”soft response” with ”hard measures”
does result in the saturation, though it may take longer.
The u, w–formulas. Upon composing the corresponding diﬀerential
equations and integrating
√them we obtain the following. The function
u(t) = C t(c+1)/2 Jc/2−1/2 ( at) for the Bessel function Jα (x) of the ﬁrst
kind models the growth of the total number of infections, where C is the
scaling parameter. Here and below time t is normalized days/10 for the
number of days from the beginning of the period of the intense growth
√
of the epidemic. Under ”soft response” it is w(t) = D t(c+1)/2 Jc−1 (2 bt)
for the same c but diﬀerent D, b. We will mostly discuss u(t), which

work with high accuracy till the late stages. Both are ∼ tc for small
t. Thus both cover well the period of initial, essentially quadratic,
growth of the number of detected infections. The parameters a, b give
the intensity of ”hard” measures correspondingly for u(t) and w(t).
For the u–function, a, the intensity (A)–measures, is 0.2 for the USA,
UK, Italy and the Netherlands. It is 0.3−0.35 for Israel, Austria, Japan,
Germany; 0.1 or smaller for Brazil, India, Sweden. The parameter c,
the initial transmission rate, is 2.2 for the USA, 2.4 for Austria, the
Netherlands, Sweden, UK, 2.6 for Italy, Germany, Japan. It jumps to
around 5 in Brazil and India. This parameter can be captured at early
stages; a, b (and d for phase 2) do depend on the management, but
they are suﬃciently uniform in quite a few countries.
Limitations. Of course there can be other reasons for our 2-phase
solution to ”serve” epidemics so well, not only due to the aggressive
management. It is not impossible that there are connections with the
replication process of viruses, but this we do not touch upon. As in
any models, there are limitations, which we will address now.
First and foremost, the available infection numbers are for the detected cases, which are mostly symptomatic. However this is not of
much concern to us. We understand managing epidemics from the
viewpoint of the management. Infected people who are detected mostly
have symptoms, but the change of the number of detected cases generally reﬂects well the ”trend”, which is suﬃcient to properly adjust the
intensity of the measures. So de facto focusing on symptomatic cases is
basically suﬃcient for the management (and for our approach). No assumptions on asymptomatic cases are necessary to obtain our formulas.
We of course understand that when the number of new reported infections drops to zero, there can be many non-detected asymptomatic
cases, which can potentially lead to the recurrence of the epidemic.
Such a saturation is only a technical end of the epidemic.
The second reservation concerns newly emerged clusters of infections , testing in new areas, and the countries where the spread is on
the rise. The u, w–formulas can be used, but signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations
can be expected. Also the usage of both Bessel-type solutions of our
equations appeared necessary to address the ”bulges” of the curves in
quite a few countries. Anyway, the parameters and predictions must
be constantly updated.
The third reservation is related to the management of the epidemic.
Not all countries employ the protection measures in similar ways, but
this is not a problem to us. The problem is if the intensity of the measures and the criteria are changed in some irregular ways. Diminishing
the ”hard” measures too early or even dropping them completely at
later stages is of this kind; this is where w(t) comes into play.

Last but not the least is the data quality . Changing frequently the
ways they are collected and the criteria makes such data useless for us.
Though, if the number of detected infections is underreported in some
regular ways, whatever the reasons, such data can be generally used.
Thus, this is suﬃciently relaxed, but the data for several countries, not
too many, are not suitable for the usage of our ”forecasting tool”.
Forecasting the spread. With these reservations, the ﬁrst point of
maximum ttop of u(t) is a good estimate for the duration of the epidemic
when the ”hard” measures are used and the response is ”hard”. If
the response to total number of infections is ”soft”, the w–function is
supposed to be used. This is assuming that the measures are systematic
and the focus is on the detection and isolation of infected people.
We note that the approximate reﬂection symmetry of du(t)/dt for the
u(t) in the range from t = 0 to ttop can be interpreted as Farr’s law of
epidemics under aggressive management. Generally, the portions of the
corresponding graph before and after the turning point are supposed
to be essentially symmetric to each other. This is not exactly true for
du(t)/dt, the ﬁrst half is a bit shorter than the second. See Figure 2
and the others; the turning point is at max{du(t)/dt}. For w(t), the
period after the turning point is somewhat longer than that before.
After the saturation is reached, the second phase begins. The formula is Ctc/2 cos(d log(t)), where t is time, d reﬂects the intensity of
”soft” measures, and c is the initial transmission rate. Here c/2 ≈ 1,
so the number of new daily detected cases is essentially constant. If
C is small enough, the spread can be controlled: new clusters of the
disease can be then promptly detected, an so on. Also, asymptomatic
(mild) cases begin to dominate at the second phase, which is a positive development too. Mathematically, the ﬁrst phase based on ”hard”
measures is necessary for phase 2.
As any model, our one is based on various simpliﬁcations. We assume
that the number of people perceptive to the virus is unlimited, i.e. we
do not consider epidemics with the number infections comparable with
the whole population. Also, we do not take into consideration the
average durations of the disease the quarantine periods in our model.
The total number of detected infections is what we are going to model,
which is commonly used and systematically reported. In spite of all
these simpliﬁcations, our 2-phase formula works very well.
We mention here a strong connections with behavioral ﬁnance : momentum risk-taking from [7]. Practically the same u(t) as above serves
”proﬁt taking” in stock markets. The initial polynomial growth of u(t)
is parallel to the ”power law” for share prices; w(t) and our solution
for the phase 2 occurred there as well

2. Two kinds of management. There is a long history and many
aspects of mathematical modeling epidemic spread; see e.g. [1] for a
review. We restrict ourselves only with the dynamic of momentum
managing epidemics , naturally mostly focusing on the middle stages,
when our actions must be as precise as possible. The two basic modes
we consider are essentially as follows:
(A) aggressive enforcement of the measures of immediate impact,
where testing-detection-isolation is the key, reacting to the current absolute numbers of detected infections, i.e. in the hardest possible way;
(B) a more balanced and more defensive approach when mathematically we react to the average numbers of infections to date and the
employed measures are of more indirect and palliative nature.
Hard and soft measures. The main examples of (A)–type measures are
prompt detection and isolation of infected people and those of high risk
to be infected, and closing places where the spread is the most likely.
Actually the primary measure here is testing ; the number of tests is
what we can really implement and control. The detection of infected
people is its main purpose, but the number of tests is obviously not
directly related to the number of detections, i.e. to the number of
positive tests . The eﬃciency of testing requires solid priorities, focus
on the groups with main risks, and solving quite a few problems.
Even simple mentioning problems with testing, detection and isolation is well beyond our article. However, numerically we can use
the following. During the epidemics, essentially during the stages of
linear growth, which are the key for us, the number of positive tests
can be mostly assumed a stable fraction of the total number of tests.
This is demonstrated in Figure 1. Such proportionality can be seen
approximately from March 16 in this ﬁgure.

(B). They are aimed at reducing c, which heavily impacted the differential equations we obtained in [6]. However the main diﬀerence
between the modes, (A) vs. (B), is the way the number of infections
is treated: the absolute number of infections is the trigger for (A),
whereas the average number of infections to date is what we monitor
under (B). The latter results in a relatively slow response; we wait
until the averages reach some levels.
The mode (AB) from [6], a combination of ”hard” measures with
”soft response”, is important at later stages of Covid-19.
Hard measures are the key. Generally, the (A)–type approach provides the fastest and hardest response to the changes with the number
of infections. We somewhat postpone with our actions until the averages reach proper levels under (B), and the measures we implement are
”softer”. Mathematically, the (B)-mode is better protected against stochastic ﬂuctuations, but it is slower and generally cannot alone lead to
the termination of the epidemic, which we justify within our approach.
The main objective of any managing epidemics is to end them quickly.
However the excessive usage of hard measures can lead to the recurrence of the epidemic, some kind of ”cost” of our aggressive interference
in a natural process. Unless herd immunity is a possibility, this can
be avoided only if we stick to the prevention measures as much as possible even when the number of new infections goes down signiﬁcantly.
Reducing them too much on the ﬁrst signs of improvement is a way to
the recurrence of the epidemic, which we can see mathematically.
Some biological aspects. The viral ﬁtness is an obvious component
of the transmission rate c. Its diminishing over time can be expected,
but this is involved. This can happen because of the virus replication
errors. The RNA viruses, Covid-19 included, replicate with ﬁdelity
that is close to error catastrophe. See e.g. [8] for some review and
predictions. Such matters are well beyond this paper, but one biological
aspect must be mentioned, concerning the asymptomatic cases.
The viruses mutate at very high rates. They can ”soften” over time
to better coexist with the hosts, though fast and eﬃcient spread is of
course the ”prime objective” of any virus. Such softening can result in
an increase of asymptomatic cases, diﬃcult to detect. So this can contribute to diminishing c we observe, though not because of the actual
decrease of the spread of the disease. We model the available (posted)
numbers of total infections, which mostly reﬂect the symptomatic cases.
To summarize, it is not impossible that the replication errors and
”softening the virus” may result in diminishing c at later stages of the
epidemic, but we think that the reduction of the contacts of infected
people with the others dominates here, which is directly linked to behavioral science, sociology and psychology.

See [9] (Ch.3, S 3.1). Practically, use BesselJ[α, x] in Mathematica.
The key point is that measures of type (A) have ”ramiﬁed” consequences, in some contrast to (B). Namely, isolated infected individuals
will not transmit the virus to many people, they will not infect many
others and so on; thus the number of those protected due to a single
isolation grows over time. Combining this with our approach to the
power law of epidemics, we arrive at the diﬀerential equation for the
total number of detected infections u(t), w(t):

both are ∼ tc for small t. Unless stated otherwise we use u = u1
and w = w1 , the dominant solutions. Actually, u1 and u2 , both, are
necessary, as we will see.
There is a surprisingly perfect match of the total number of infections
for Covid-19 during the initial and middle stages with our u(t), from
the moment when these numbers begin to grow ”signiﬁcantly” and
during some time after the ”turning point”. In the USA and UK, it
certainly was from March 15 till April 15. Epidemics are very stochastic
processes, so such a precision is unexpected.

Sweden, and UK (at that time).
The black dots show the test period, which was till ttop , May 5.
Mathematically, the assumption was that the intensity of hard measures would continue to be proportional to the total number of detected

u(t) is not applicable, as for the USA and UK, then the usage of w(t)
is supposed to be the next natural step according to [6].

numbers. The black dots constitute the control period: 04/16-05/05.
Now c = 2.4, a = 0.2 work ﬁne, and the scaling coeﬃcient is 2.2. The
total number of cases is divided by 10K, not by 100K as for the USA.
The ”u–saturation moment” was 5.17, i.e about 51 days after March 16,
somewhere around May 6. The estimate for the corresponding number
of infections was about 170K, with all ifs. This was assuming that the
”hard” measures would be employed at the same pace as before April
15, i.e. following mode (A), the most aggressive approach.

Sweden 03/07-04/23. This is an example of the country that remains
essentially ”open”. Actually, they actively do testing of infected people, a ”hard” measure from our perspective. Also, the strength of the
health-care in this country must be taken into consideration, and that
Sweden is surrounded by the countries that ﬁght Covid-17 aggressively.
The growth of the total number of cases was essentially quadratic for
a relatively long period, which is what ”power law” states for the epidemics with minimal ”intervention”. By now, the growth is linear; the
reduction from tc to tc/2 follows from our theory. Mathematically, our
u– formula is still applicable, but for low a = 0.1. Here y is the total
number of cases divided by 1000 ; add 137, the initial value, to our
y. The projected u–saturation was around May 17, with all standard
reservations; see Figure 4. Of course the usage of u, w is questionable
for the countries that do not employ hard measures.
Israel: ”saturation”. The country went through the ”saturation”.
Israeli population is diverse, which has a potential of signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations of the number of cases and various clusters of infection. However
its solid response to Covid-19 and good overall health-system, made
the growth of the spread suﬃciently predictable. We divide the total
number of cases by 1000, as for Sweden; see Figure 5.
The red dots began March 13, when the total number of detected infections was 96, and stopped April 17; the remaining period till May 5,
shown by the black dots, was the ”control one”. The saturation forecast
went through almost perfectly, but there were signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations
in process. After April 26, the predicted moment of the saturation, the
growth of the total number of (known) infections is supposed to be mild

linear and became so. The parameters are: a = 0.3, i.e. the intensity of
hard measures is better than with the USA, UK, and c = 2.6. The latter means that the initial transmission coeﬃcient was somewhat worse
than those in the USA and UK, possibly due to the greater number
of ”normal” contacts. Recall that a, c are parameters of our theory,
related to but not immediately connected with the real factors.

Brazil and India. There are ongoing processes in both countries, which
are actually similar mathematically. Phase 1 can be very well modeled
using the combination of two our solutions u1 ,u2 . We take them here
and below with the same scaling coeﬃcient C.
They parameters are a = 0.04, c = 4.47, C = 0.65 for Brazil, where
we set y =cases/10K. In contrast to the previous examples, we use
u1 = Cu1 and the second (non-dominant) solution u2 = Cu2 :

√
u(t) = u1 (t)−0.35u2 = C tc/2+0.5 Jc/2−0.5 ( at)−0.35J0.5−c/2 ( at) .
Note that the parameter a, the intensity of ”hard measures”, is very
low, and c is quite large.

Figure 6. Brazil: c = 4.47, a = 0.04, C = 0.65.
The parameters are even more extreme for India: a = 0.035, c =
5.2. This country is still in the period of polynomial growth of the
spread, as of August 25. The analysis of India is obviously important
to understand the future of Covid-19. We provide the corresponding u–
curve. Recall that it is under the assumption that the ”hard” measures
are used in a steady manner, which was the case in almost all Western
Europe, China, South Korea, the USA (during some periods), and
in several other countries. Also, a suﬃciently high level of healthcare system and the uniformity of measures in the whole country are
necessary for the success of such measures.
Even when all these factors are present, the spread can be very intensive. This occurred in the USA, where the u-curve and w-curve served
well only the middle stages. In India, the parameters of the spread
were the most extreme among the countries we consider in this paper:

We set y =cases/10K in Fig. 7. The period we used to determine
the parameters was 3/20-8/23 (no ”black dots”). The starting number
of detected cases was 191, which was subtracted,
Actually, 0.0125(t+0.07)3.65 gives a good approximation for the main
part of the period; see Figure 7, where the graph of this function is
shown as brown. So this is really a period of (strong) polynomial
growth, but obviously not of any exponential growth. We never observed exponential growth of the number of detected infections with
Covid-19 beyond some very short initial periods.

Figure 7. India : 3/20 − 8/23, c = 5.2, a = 0.035, C = 0.1.
Let us update Figure 7 till 10/07/2020. The parameters there were
determined before the turning point, so they were not that reliable. As
of the beginning of November, India presumably reached this point.
Interestingly, only c required some adjustment; it is now c = 5.75 vs
c = 5.2 determined for the period till 8/23. All other coeﬃcients,
including the exponent are unchanged. The same (brown) power function 0.0125(t + 0.07)3.65 provided a good approximation till the turning
point. The match with our Bessel-type solution was almost perfect,
though of course much will depend on the further developments in India. Recall that y =cases/10K in Fig. 8. The red dots are those
used in Figure 7 (till 8/23). The clear polynomiality of the curve of
total cases in India and the match with our u-functions are of course
important conﬁrmations of our theory. We have:

aggressive respond to the current number of total cases, i.e. under (A)mode. Then ttop , the ﬁrst zero of du(t)/dt is a reasonable estimate for
the ”phase-one saturation” in almost all Europe, about 20 states in the
USA and other places.
Reducing hard measures (if any) almost after the turning point, or
after what looks like a turning point naturally inﬂuences such forecasts.
The growth can be expected linear then, but the number of daily new
infections can be very high. From our perspective, this means a switch
from mode (A) to mode (B) or (AB). With the latter, the hard measures are still present, but the response becomes softer, of type B. For
instance, if the number of new cases is essentially a constant, even
uncomfortably high, the (B)–response is to keep the testing-detection
constant too. Type–(A) response will be ”parabolic” in this case.
Obviously the improvements with testing and better capacities for
isolation and treatment is quite a consideration for reopening places
with potentially high risks of the spread of Covid-19. Also, people who
suspect that they are infected request help begin more actively at this
stage, which works in the same direction as any ”hard” measures.
Mathematically, if the new daily cases are constant but relatively
high, a diﬀerent kind of modeling is required, which is (AB). Our
theory provides this. The assumption is that the hard measures are
still in place, but the response to the current total number of detected
infections is via U (t)/t instead of U (t); see Section 2.
This model is governed by w(t). The point tw
top where the (ﬁrst) maximum of w(t) occurs seems a reasonable upper bound for the ”technical
saturation”. The prior tutop = ttop then is a lower bound; we obtain some
forecast cone : between ttop
u and the w-curve.

Actually even relatively minor deviations with a, c can lead to signiﬁcant changes of u(t) over time, so there are some natural ”cones”.
However, we have something more fundamental here. The switch to
w(t) is due to a diﬀerent kind of management.
When the daily numbers of new cases are high, there are of course
signiﬁcant chances of new clusters and ﬂuctuations of the data of all
kinds. So we need to model a process with many uncertainties. However, we think that this is basically no diﬀerent from what we did for
the middle stages, where u(t) was surprisingly eﬃcient.

The cone for the USA. The prior ttop = tutop for u(t) was May 5, with
a, c, C calculated on the bases of the data till April 16. It was under
the expectations that the ”hard” measures would applied as in (A) (as
before April 16). However the presence of 3 major spikes in the daily
cases and other factors like de facto relaxing hard measures obviously
signiﬁcantly delayed the saturation.
Whatever the reasons, the switch to the (AB)-mode and w(t) was
for us a natural adjustment. However, it appeared insuﬃcient for the
USA. We provide the blue dots , obtained after the forecast cone was
determined. For Sweden, the cone was not expected to work, but the
dots for the USA appeared following a kind of ”Sweden pattern”.
The cone is deﬁned as the area between u(t) extended by a constant
u(ttop ) for t > tutop and the graph of w(u) till tw

other in the range of red dots. The above relation for C/D holds with
the accuracy about 20%.
We mostly monitor the trend , the ”derivative” of the graph of black
dots, which is supposed to be close to the derivative of w(t) or u(t).
See Figure 9. The spikes with number of cases are acceptable if the
dots continue to be ”parallel” to u(t) or w(t) (or in between).

obtained then and now for UK are in Figure 10. The expected tw
top was
around 06/10 with the total number of detected infections about 330K.
These ”predictions” went through; UK is now in phase 2: Figure 17.
For Sweden, the total number of infections in Sweden was actually
not supposed to match our u, w–curves, because this country does not
follow hard ways of ﬁghting Covid-19. This can be clearly seen in
Figure 11. We note that the USA and UK (for some time) have followed
the ”Sweden approach”, relaxation hard measures on the ﬁrst signs of
improvements , when the numbers of new daily cases were essentially
constant but still very high.
5. Two-phase solution. Let us now focus on our two-phase model
for the number of total infections, which is from the beginning of the intensive spread through the saturation ttop of type (A), and then (phase
2) till the ”ﬁnal saturation” under the formulas for the (B)–phase. It
works surprisingly well for the countries that reached phase 2, so the
(AB)–mode was mostly unnecessary for them.

intermediate point. Practically, this means that the (B) formula we
ﬁnd provides the rest of the curve after ttop . After that moment, the
usage of ”soft” measures can be mathematically suﬃcient to end the
epidemic. Note that d can be determined only in the vicinity of ttop ,
when/if it is reached.
The epidemic is of course far from over, but the ﬁrst ”cycle” hopefully
approaches the end in these countries; so no test periods, ”blue dots”,
seem necessary. Recall that the parameters a, c, C for the ﬁrst phase
are mostly obtained on the basis of the period before or around the
”turning points”; the same c, the initial transmission coeﬃcient, is
supposed to be used for both, (A) and (B), according to our theory.
For Israel, the period was 03/13-05/22. Here c = 2.6, a = 0.3, d =

coeﬃcients are C = 2.2, CB = 3.4. Note that u(t) =

This maximum is the reason for a well-visible bulge in the middle of
the sequence of red dots. Actually, we can see some kind of the bulge
for Israel too, but it was short-lived. The coeﬃcient of −u2 is 1; it is
smaller for other considered countries.
Germany: 3/07-5/22. See Figure 14. We begin here with the initial
number of total infections 684, which must be subtracted when calculating the red dots. This is the moment when the curve began to look

UK: 03/16-06/13. This country was a challenge for us, though it
”eventually” managed to reach phase 2 almost following the ”usual
pattern”. The u-function here is with the same a, c as for the Netherlands. Actually the red dots match better our w-function (from the
(AB)-mode). However, we prefer to stick to the original u(t). Then
it is combination of two phases separated by a linear period , about 10
days. See Figure 17. The parameter d = 0.465 is diﬀerent from that
for the Netherlands (0.54). This can be expected; the process toward
the saturation of phase 2 was and is slower for UK.
Here u(t) = u1 (t) is what we used in Figures 3, 10:

Second wave in the USA. This solution worked well at least till the
middle of September for the second wave in the USA, which began
in the middle of June. The accuracy is comparable with what we
obtained and discussed in this paper for the ﬁrst waves in Japan, Israel,
Italy, Germany, UK and the Netherlands. Upon subtracting 2.1M , the
parameters we obtained for the early-middle stage of the 2nd wave in
the USA were: a◦ = 0.06, c◦ = 2.65,
√
u◦1,2 (t) = 3.4 t(c◦ +1)/2 J± c◦ −1 ( a◦ t), u◦ (t) = u◦1 (t) + 0.6u◦2 (t).

The second phase matched well the following function:
uB (t) = 4.1 tc/2 cos(d log(M ax(1, t))), c = 2.65, d = 0.435.

Figure 18. 2-phase solution for the 2nd wave in the USA.
To ﬁnalize, the best ways to use our curves seem as follows:
(1): determine a, c, C when the spread looks essentially linear;
(2): update them constantly till the turning point and beyond;
(3): expect the ”bulges” to appear and add the u2 (t) if needed;
(4): try to adjust the intensity of the measures to match u(t) ;
(5): at the turning point, determine b, D and the bound w(t);
(6): after the saturation at ttop , ﬁnd d and switch to phase 2 ,
6. Automated forecasting. Generally, our two-phase solution serve
the best as a forecasting tool if the measures and data are as uniform
and ”stable” as possible. Then underreporting the number of infections, focusing on symptomatic cases, and inevitable ﬂuctuations with
the data may not inﬂuence too much the applicability of the u, w–
curves and uB .
When the situation in the country is ﬂuid, we are supposed to use
the programs for constant producing the projections; this appeared the
best for the USA. Our software automatically ﬁnds, the corresponding
curve, determines the current phase, and provides the forecast. The
latter can be ”linear” if the country/area is in phase 1. For the USA,
all 50 states were treated independently, and their interaction was
subtracted from the total sum of the resulting curves.

Figure 21. The auto-forecast for the USA as of June 14.
The interaction is basically allowing our curves in the states reached
phase 2 to begin to diminish after their saturation. Currently the projection is that the beginning of October can be when the USA reaches
the stage as in Europe in late June or so. Such iterraction makes sense,
since any states (and countries) beneﬁt from the improvements with
the epidemic in their neighbors. We provide one output in Figure 21.
August-September 2020. There is a variant of this program: the
”universal program” for forecasting late stages of the waves of Covid19 in any countries or groups of countries. It gave quite stable results
for Western Europe, but only till the middle of August. Then the
second wave began there, presumably due to the end of vacations and
the beginning of the school year.
The fact that many schools and businesses were closed in the USA, in
contrast to Europe, contributed to a signiﬁcant reduction of the second
wave in the USA, which began around the middle of June. However
this trend changed in the middle of September: the number of new
daily cases became essentially constant, which corresponds to a linear
growth of the total number of cases. In Europe, a strong growth of the
total number of (detected) cases began in the end of August, so the
program became essentially a linear approximation in September for
Europe.
We will provide one of the last outputs, as of 09/22, for the second
wave in the USA before the linear growth began there: Fig. 22. The

To conclude, any forecasting required and requires mathematics.
Any analysis or discussion of such complex events as epidemics must be
based on strict deﬁnitions. For instance, comparing diﬀerent countries
and various phases is impossible without solid mathematical methods.
This is fully applicable to understanding the eﬃciency of the measures
employed, which can be a diﬃcult task even if the corresponding mathematical tools are adequate.
The management of the spread of Covid-19 requires constant and
sharp monitoring its eﬃciency, which is possible only if there are reliable mathematical models. Paper [6] was actually the ﬁrst one focused
on the management, especially on the impact of ”hard measures”.
Mathematically, our ”two-phase solution”, where the role of ”hard
measures” is assumed the key, provides very accurate modeling the
curves of total detected infections. It appeared fully applicable to the
second waves, which is quite a conﬁrmation. Without any mathematics, an unusually short break between the ﬁrst and the second waves in
many countries is a clear demonstration that the success with managing
the ﬁrst waves was mostly due to the ”hard measures”.

Qualitatively, the importance of the preventive measures is obvious.
The problem is to create their quantitative theory and to implement it
practically. Our ”two-phase solution” seems a very good candidate.
