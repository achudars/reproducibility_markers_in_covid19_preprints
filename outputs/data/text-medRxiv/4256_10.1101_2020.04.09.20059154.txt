Background: The epidemiology of COVID-19 remains speculative in Africa. To the best of our knowledge, no
study, using robust methodology provides its trajectory for the region or accounts for local context. This paper is
the first systematic attempt to provide prevalence, incidence, and mortality estimates across Africa.
Methods: Caseloads and incidence forecasts are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model.
Fatality rates from Italy and China were applied to generate mortality estimates after making relevant health
system and population-level characteristics related adjustments between each of the African countries.
Results: By June 30 2020, around 16.3 million people in Africa will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to
98,358,799). Northern and Eastern Africa will be the most and least affected areas. Cumulative cases by June 30
are expected to reach around 2.9 million (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2.8 million (95% CI
517,489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1.2 million (95% CI 229,111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa.
Incidence for the month of April 2020 is expected to be highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77),
while Morocco will experience among the highest fatalities (1,045 deaths, 95% CI 167 to 6,547).
Conclusion: Less urbanized countries with low levels of socio-economic development (hence least connected to the
world), are likely to register lower and slower transmissions at the early stages of an epidemic. However, the same
enabling factors that worked for their benefit can hinder interventions that have lessened the impact of COVID19 elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION

The novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) outbreak initially emerged in Wuhan,
China, in late 2019. Since then, it has spread to 198 countries and territories around the world and has
been declared a pandemic. (1) As of March 31, 2020, there have been 750,874 reported COVID-19 cases,
with 36,045 deaths, and 117,603 recoveries. (1) The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Africa was
reported in Egypt on February 14, 2020 and since then the number of confirmed infections in the region
has surpassed 5,000 cases as of March 31, 2020. (2-3) Comoros, Lesotho, Malawi, and South Sudan are
the only African countries that have not reported a confirmed case as of March 31, 2020.
To date, no vaccine or effective treatment is available for COVID-19. Therefore, the ability to minimise
the devastating consequences of the disease on people’s lives and livelihoods relies on the implementation
of effective preventative non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). NPIs include multiple public health
measures designed to reduce viral transmission rates in a population by reducing the reproduction
number (R0); the average number of secondary cases each case generates. (4-6)
NPIs directly influence the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the rate of spread, and the
expected duration of the pandemic. However, several characteristics of the virus remain ambiguous or
mostly unknown, (7-8) such as the incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset),
serial interval (the time between symptom onset of a primary and secondary case) the extent of
asymptomatic cases, the possibility of pre-symptomatic infectiousness, case fatality rate (CFR), and
also the possible role of weather in transmission. Estimates for COVID-19 CFR range from 0.3-1%. (9)
Asymptomatic or mild presentation comprises the bulk of the reported cases, which is an estimated at
80%. (10) Longitudinal viremia measurements from a small study (sample size of 16), suggests that
there are high enough viral loads to trigger pre-symptomatic infectiousness for 1-2 days before the onset
of symptoms.(11) With the lack of clinical studies measuring viremia, the infectious period also remains
largely unknown, with estimates ranging from few days to 10 days or more after the incubation period.
(11)
The complexity of the infection and recovery process, therefore, means that proper understanding of
the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 within the local context is fundamental to combat the
pandemic. Studies illustrating future trajectories of the disease are not only helpful to develop early
warning systems, avoid overwhelming healthcare services and minimize morbidity and mortality from
the disease, but also assist countries to evaluate the effects of interventions and the long-term
consequences of the virus on peoples’ livelihood. This is particularly true in Africa, where livelihoods
are fragile, and previous epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS and, more recently, Ebola, have been known to
exert enormous socioeconomic consequences. (12-14) In addition, in the face of a new pandemic in the
region, the already overstretched healthcare systems that are struggling to deliver essential healthcare
services such as immunization and HIV/AIDS treatment would be in further jeopardy and at risk of
losing the gains achieved so far in disease control efforts. This study, using a robust methodology,
provides spatial and temporal trajectories of COVID-19 for the entire Africa region. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first such attempt and accounts for the local context and characteristics relevant
to the epidemiology of the diseases in the region.
The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. In section 2, we describe our covariate based
predictive model and the input data that has been used in the modeling exercise. We also describe the
methodology used for estimating deaths from COVID-19. Section 3 provides the results on the projected
new infections, cumulative cases, and deaths due to COVID-19 across several countries, covering the
five sub regions. Finally, we discuss the key findings and implications of the study in section 4 and in
Section 5 provide some concluding remarks.

METHODS

The analysis is based on a linear instrumental variable (IV) regression framework. The basic model
consists of two equations which can be expressed as follows: (15-17)

Y = δ + β1 K + β2 X + u i
K = θ + α1T + zi
……………………………………………………….Equation (1)
Here, Y represents the number of confirmed cases of COVD-19 for each country as of March 31, 2020.
K is the rate of infection between week 1 and week 2 of the epidemic in the country and is an endogenous
variable. T and X represent a set of instrumental and exogenous variables, respectively. ui and zi are
error terms and both are assumed to have a zero mean and a nonzero-correlation. (18-20) δ, θ, α, β are
regression coefficients to be estimated from the model.
The model captures a combination of epidemiological, socio-economic and health system readiness
related covariates. On the epidemiological side, it includes time since the introduction of the virus
measured against March 31 2020, the rate of its expansion between week one and week two of the
pandemic in the respective countries as well as the disease profile of each nation. We have modeled the
‘early expansion factor’ using air traffic as its instrument because the early stage of the epidemic is
presumed to be dominated by imported cases rather than due to community infection. Wooldridge’s
(1995) robust score test for endogeneity has confirmed our expectation that the rate of early expansion
must be treated as endogenous.
We have also included in our model household size and age structure because both can influence social
distancing behavior and practices and could play a mediating role once a community infection is in
place. Urbanization and living standard can be expected to further serve as fertile grounds for spreading
viruses widely as they could facilitate the interaction and flow of people across a wider environment.
Likewise, countries that adhere to international health regulations and provide better access to quality
health care are likely to detect and report cases better.
Taking these hypothesized relationships in to account, we have captured the following covariates in our
model: time since first reported case, rate of expansion of the disease between week one and week two
of the epidemic, urbanicity, socio-demographic index (as a measure of living standard), average
household size, the age structure of the population, health care access and quality index, adherence to
international health regulations, and prevalence of HIV and asthma.
The data on prevalence of HIV and asthma, as well as on socio-demographic index and the index of
health care access and quality, were from Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). (21-23)
The data on urbanization were obtained from the Population Reference Bureau, (24) while average
household size, age profile, and data on the total population used for the calculation of rates were all
from the UN Population Division. (25) The index of adherence to international health regulations was
accessed from the World Health Organization (WHO), while the number of confirmed cases was from
the John Hopkins database of COVID-19. (26 -27)
The 11 variables selected for analyses were chosen out of an initial set of over 20 variables that included
the proportion of households with at least one member aged 60 years or over, the proportion of
households with at least one member aged 65 years or over, the World Bank’s governance index, as
well as the prevalence of TB, diabetes and malaria. STATA’s Lasso software for model selection was
used to narrow down the list of covariates. (28) Furthermore, out of the global database covering the
193 countries that we captured as an input in our analyses, for a few countries, data were unavailable

for selected variables, namely air traffic (25 countries), adherence to international health regulation (20
countries), and household size (24 countries). To bridge the gap, we performed multiple imputation
procedures, particularly by running 1000 imputations and 99 000 iterations using STATA’s multiple
imputation routine. (29-30) The resulting median values from the imputation exercise were
subsequently used to estimate the prediction model specified earlier. We transformed all the regressors
as well as the dependent variables to a log-scale before they were put into the model.
The goodness-of-fit for the predictive model was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation technique. (3132) The advantage of a k-fold cross-validation technique over other statistical validation procedures is
that all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for
validation exactly once. (31) When summarized, our prediction results can be viewed as a function of
time since the introduction of the virus, once those other time-invariant covariates are controlled for.
Higher order relationships with time are not considered here because the pandemic in the Africa region
is in early and expansionary stage. As more and more countries in the world manage to ‘flatten the
curve’ the trends and lessons from those experiences can be integrated in covariate-based models like
ours.
Estimation of COVID-19 deaths was made using an approach that loosely related to indirect
standardization technique, with additional adjustments for differences in health system readiness and
living standards. In the absence of age-specific infection data the proposed approach can be expressed
in a general form as follows (including in instances where age is treated as a continuous function):

𝑎𝑦𝑘 = [𝑝𝑦 ∫ 𝑤𝑖𝑦 𝑐𝑖𝑘 ]⁄𝑏𝑦𝑘 ….…………………………………………………………. (Equation 2a)
Where,

𝑏𝑦𝑘 = √𝑆𝑦 𝑄𝑦 / √𝑆𝑘 𝑄𝑘 ………………………………………………………………(Equation 2b)

Here, 𝑎𝑦𝑘 is the estimated number of deaths for country y (y= 1, 2…47) using country k’s (China and
Italy) COVID-19 fatality rate, general health system readiness and socio-economic standards as a
reference. 𝑐𝑖𝑘 is the standard or reference age-specific fatality rate for age group i in standard country
k, in our case obtained from China and Italy. 𝑤𝑖𝑦 is the population at age i in country y; 𝑝𝑦 is
population level COVID-19 prevalence rate and is an estimate we generated using the instrumental
variable regression expressed in equation 1. The quantity in the square bracket represents agestandardized estimated number of deaths in country y, if age-specific fatality rates were to follow those
of the standard populations. However, our study population differs from the two countries not just with
respect to age structure but also living standard and health system readiness. Hence, to adjust the
estimated deaths further we developed a correction factor that links the socio-economic status and
health system readiness of each country with those two populations, which is represented by 𝑏𝑦𝑘 . In
this case, 𝑏𝑦𝑘 is a geometric-mean of the socio-demographic index (S) and the health access and quality
index (Q) relative to that of country k. The relevant data for each country was sourced from IHME.
(21-22) Analysis was performed using STATA version 16.0 .(33)

RESULTS

Figure A1 in the Appendix shows a graphical comparison of observed and predicted confirmed COVID19 cases (on the log scale). Table A1 presents results from the cross-fold robustness test for the
predictive model. The statistical diagnostic tests as well the patterns from the graphical analysis suggest
that the predicative model sufficiently captures the observed data. As can be seen from the table, not
only are the RMSE, the MAE and the Pseudo-R2 consistent across samples, the error margins are also
small. Hence, we have used the resulting model to forecast cumulative COVID-19 cases, estimate new
infections and deaths from COVID-19 for each of the 47 African countries which have reported at least
one case as of March 31, 2020.
Cumulative COVID-19 cases and point prevalence rates
Table 1 presents cumulative COVID-19 cases and prevalence rates for Africa and its five sub-regions
for the period April 1 to June 30 2020. By the end of April cumulated infection across the region will
reach 2.5 million cases and will further increase to 16.2 million by June 30. During the same period,
cumulative cases in the hardest hit sub-region in the African continent, Northern Africa, is predicted
to increase from 1.3 million at the end of April to over 7.5 million by June 30. This is followed by
Southern, Western, and Central Africa sub-regions. Throughout the forecast period, Eastern Africa is
predicted to experience the lowest case load and prevalence rate in the continent throughout the forecast
period. Note these estimates are highly uncertain; the 95% confidence intervals (CI) are shown in Table
1 below.

Figure 1A shows spatial patterns of cumulative COVID-19 cases for the African continent. In Northern
Africa, the leading contributor to the burden of COVID-19 is Morocco. By the end of June, Morocco
will have 4.5 million cumulative COVID-19 cases, and this is almost double the estimated number for
Algeria, a country with the next highest burden, 2.8 by the end of June. In Southern Africa, South

Africa and Swaziland are on the lead. By the end of June, these two countries are expected to have
respectively around 2.6 million and 250 thousand cumulative COVID-19 cases. In the Western Africa
sub-region, cumulative cases will be dominated by Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana, despite Nigeria having a
larger population than both countries combined.
To remove the effect of size, we also estimated prevalence rates shown in Panel B of Table 1 by
combining the forecasts on cumulative cases with population estimates which we generated for each
month from the UN annual population estimates. This suggests that population level prevalence of
COVID-19 in Africa is expected to remain under 1.5 percent (CI 95% 0.03 to 7.6) throughout the
prediction period, but there are wide inter-regional differences. In the Northern and Southern Africa
sub-regions, cumulative infection rates are expected to be slightly over 3 percent, with the rate in the
respective subregions expected to be around 3.5 percent (CI 95% 0.09 to 22.1) as of June 30. This
means that even under a very high infection scenario, as observed in the 95% upper confidence interval
for the two sub-regions, infection rates are unlikely to reach more than a quarter of the continent’s
population.

New infections and COVID-19 incidence rates across Africa
Across the months, the number of new COVID-19 infections are expected to increase from 2.5 million
cases in April, to 5.8 million cases in May, to 8 million cases by the end of June. This represents a 135%
increase from April to May and a 39% increase from May to June, which suggests a possible slowing
down of the pandemic over time.

Sub-regional and country level differences are expected to deepen as the pandemic becomes more
established in the region. In the coming three months, incidence is expected to increase faster in
Southern and Northern Africa, followed by the Central Africa sub-region. In each sub-region, we expect
some countries to be affected more than others and become hotbeds of new infections (see Figure 1B).
In places like Djibouti, the rate of new infections is expected to reach as high as 32.8 (CI 95% of 6.25
to 171.77) cases per 1000 population, followed by Swaziland with a rate of new infection of 26.8 (CI
95% of 4.97 to 144.39), Morocco with 11.97 (CI 95% of 1.98 to 71.59), Algeria with 9.80 (CI 95% of
1.57 to 60.72) and Cote d’Ivorie with 6.65 (CI 95% of 1.07 to 29.68). See Figure 1B.

Estimated COVID-19 mortality
Deaths for COVID-19 are estimated for each country, using the approach described in Section 2. As
can be seen in Figure 2, the adjustment shows relatively higher expected mortality using Italy as a
standard compared to China, but generally are closer to each other. Hence, our final country level
estimates presented in Figure 1C and the regional summaries in Table 3, were generated using the
arithmetic mean of death numbers generated using the two standard populations.

Africa

The first COVID-19 case in Africa was reported on February 14, 2020 (2, 3). Two months after the
first COVID-19 cases were reported in the region, the number of deaths at the end of April is expected
to reach over 3,000 deaths (CI 95% of 537 to 18,482). Most deaths will be recorded in the Northern
Africa sub-region, which, as reported earlier, also had the largest number of COVID-19 cases and the
highest prevalence and incidence rates of all sub-regions in the content. Southern and Western Africa
are expected to experience a comparable death toll, while deaths in the Eastern Africa sub-region are
expected to be the lowest of the sub-regions in Africa. Some countries such as Algeria, Morocco and
South Africa are expected to experience the highest number of casualties since the beginning of the
pandemic, in excess of 400 deaths. Deaths in the three countries will comprise of almost two-thirds of
all expected deaths in the region. In others, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tunisia and
Cote d I’vorie, the death toll will reach between 150 and 300, and contribute 20% to the regional total,
while half of the continent (about 29 countries) will experience less than 10 deaths each. The same
trend continues in May and June, but with a much higher number of expected deaths.

DISCUSSION

The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading rapidly across different parts of the world and the African
continent has not been spared. Given the global trajectory, what lies ahead in terms of the course and
magnitude of infection in Africa in the days and months to come remains speculative. While there have
been attempts elsewhere in capturing the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic using agent-based, or
mathematical, and or statistical models, this has not been the case for the African region as whole. (46, 8) To the best of our knowledge, no study, using a robust methodology, provides estimates on future
trend of COVID-19 for the entire region or accounts for its local context.
Modeling and predicting the epidemiology and trajectory of a disease such as COVID-19 is a challenging
exercise. Firstly, COVID-19 is a newly identified pathogen and knowledge about the characteristics of
the virus, including how the disease is spread and the time from exposure to onset of symptoms are
still evolving. Secondly, at the time of writing, less than a handful of countries had reached a plateau
in their infection rate, and this makes modeling future trends an open-ended exercise. (1) The fact that
some people only experience mild symptoms and that even the best health system can only detect and
treat those presenting to facilities also means that the available data on ‘confirmed’ cases represents
only a fraction of the true picture of the pandemic.
Thirdly, literature on the association between disease prevalence and population level characteristics
that are known to be the staple of social and descriptive epidemiology, and the backbone of predictive
modeling exercises are yet to emerge for COVID-19. (4-6, 8) Further, at the individual level, knowledge
on the determinants of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is limited to selected characteristics such
as age and pre-existing conditions, and even then, they are drawn from scanty data. The association
with community and population level characteristics is even more limited, hence largely speculative. In
this context, the task of developing a multi-country covariate-based predictive model for COVID-19 in
any country or region of the world, let alone Africa, is likely to be guided by what is feasible, and to
the extent, the available data permits it. It also means that there is a need for constant revision of
predictive models as new data becomes available. In our case, the work is further complicated because
in Africa data on key covariates are either lacking or when they exist, they tend to be biased or derived
from other global covariate-based modeling exercises. (21-22)
Despite this, we have made efforts to mitigate these limitations by curating data from various credible
sources around the world and assessing them for consistency. In developing our model, we have used
data sources from 193 countries globally and used statistical relationships to fill data gaps on covariates
in the Africa region. Additionally, our model performance was assessed through rigorous out of sample
calibration using k-fold cross-validation techniques and obtaining robust results. We have also restricted
our forecast to the first few months (April-June) and refrained from a long-term projection exercise.
Firstly, this is because we anticipate new and additional data to emerge in the short term that will lead
to better and improved estimates. Secondly, where data is sparse, any long-term projection is more
likely to be detached from reality and can easily become a wild guess and is therefore less useful for
informing policy actions. Thirdly, if the countries in the region will not be able to put effective strategies
soon (or in those who have already initiated them render to be ineffective), the extent and consequence
of COVID-19 on the continent would be greater than any predictive model could anticipate.
Within these caveats, our study substantially contributes to the growing literature on understanding
the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This perspective is particularly important for Africa at a
time of controlling a pandemic given that Africa the region is home to over 1.3 billion people. (34) In
addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic is predicted to start to taper off in the northern hemisphere there
are increasing concerns and attention towards Africa and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere that
had late introduction and slow uptick of cases. Our model projection is therefore necessary, and timely
to guide this attention.

MedRxiv: Africa and the COVID-19 pandemic

doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059154

Our results show a heterogeneous picture of projected new infections, cumulative cases, and deaths
across the African continent. Our Among our key findings are that African countries that are relatively
more urbanized and have a higher socio-demographic index (SDI) are projected to experience a faster
growth of the epidemic, at least during the initial periods. To illustrate this trend, Algeria, Morocco,
and Tunisia, in the Northern African sub-region, which have a predominantly urban population, and
are in close proximity to the high burden European countries, are projected to experience a higher
incidence of COVID-19 infections in comparison to their neighbors. In the Southern Africa sub-region,
South Africa, which has a proportionately higher urban population and greater international
connectivity, is also projected to lead the rest of the pack in terms of new infections rates. In the Eastern
Africa sub-region, Kenya, which is relatively more urbanized has a higher per capita incidence rate in
comparison to other countries within the sub-region. However, it is noted that some of these countries
also have higher living standards and better health system than most countries in the region. Hence
the high prevalence rates and estimated deaths in these countries may in part reflect their greater
ability to detect and confirm COVID-19 cases.
On the other hand, countries such as Angola, Botswana and Mozambique with a lower international
connectivity are projected to have lower rates of new infections during the initial periods. Similar trends
are observed in Burundi and Tanzania in the Eastern Africa region. However, as the epidemic grows
many of these countries are projected to experience increases in cumulative infections that are likely to
overwhelm their health system. Overall, these trends are consistent with other regions of the world,
where since the onset of this pandemic, it has been clear that higher connectivity, particularly through
air traffic, and higher population densities are key drivers in the introduction and growth of the
epidemic. (35-39)
The impact of population density is clearly illustrated by the projected new infections of COVID-19 in
places like Djibouti and Rwanda. To compound this, close to 90% of urban settlements in Africa are
comprised of informal settlements, most of which are overcrowded and lack basic amenities such as
clean water and sanitation which are critical prevention measures for COVID-19. (40-42) Moreover,
60% of jobs in urban areas are in the informal economy, (43) and if African countries were to implement
stringent lockdowns these livelihoods would be largely affected and could lead to significant
socioeconomic consequences. For instance, those that lose their jobs are likely to move back to their
homes in rural areas, where many of the elderly population reside, hence putting them at risk. Similarly,
as the economy slows down in several countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some sections of
migrant workers from African countries might be forced to return to their home countries and hence
further complicating the dynamics of the pandemic.
Therefore, large scale measures that are aimed at limiting population movement, across countries as
well as increasing the social distance among populations, are not enough, or at best may prove to be
impractical to address the pandemic in the African context. Comprehensive response measures should
be contextualized and seek to address some of the underlying individual and structural factors that are
likely to complicate the epidemic within these environments. It is crucial to balance interventions geared
towards preventing the spread of the epidemic with the need to maintaining livelihoods and social
cohesion. Measures such as appropriate messaging, provision of adequate water and sanitation
subsidies, food as well as targeted restriction of movement (e.g. from urban to rural) would go a long
way to mitigate the spread.
Still, even with all these NPI measures, several countries with weak healthcare delivery systems are
expected to have a significant number of infections and fatalities. Therefore, the already overstretched
healthcare systems in Africa need to anticipate and prepare to handle an increased number of patients
as a consequence of the pandemic, on top of the other common disease conditions that are prevalent in
the region. Unfortunately, this is a lesson Africa has already had to learn from the 2014 Ebola outbreak
in West Africa. It is estimated there were an additional 11,000 deaths from malaria, HIV/AIDS and
TB across Sierra-Leone, Guinea and Liberia, (44) a 60% decrease in the number of children treated for

diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (45) and a 38% increase in maternal mortality in Guinea and
a 111% increase in Liberia. (46-47)
Understanding the factors that accelerate and those that mitigate the spread and mortality related to
COVID-19, while accounting for local realities, is fundamental for sound public health measures to
tackle the pandemic. In fact, lessons from HIV/AIDS programming have taught us that highly effective
health interventions fail if the local context is not recognized. Therefore, decision makers in Africa must
realize that one size does not fit all and could lead to disastrous outcomes. They should also find ways
and means to maintain the progress made toward universal childhood immunization and the HIV
epidemics in the region.
Effective detection and response to epidemics is premised on decision makers having the right
epidemiological information. Unfortunately, many countries in Africa have weak health information
systems that are not able to collect and process data rapidly to facilitate timely and targeted action.
For example, Lesotho, despite being in the same region and with closer proximity to South Africa and
Swaziland, countries that are at the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southern Africa subregion, is yet to register a confirmed case. This is a clear example of the gap in diagnostic capacity and
health information system rather than the absence of infection in the country. Hence, the fight to stop
the pandemic in Africa should be focused on both strengthening clinical capacity as well reporting
systems within the health care system. Innovations around collecting data through digital platforms
make it easier to combine different data streams, thereby helping decision-makers gain a better
understanding of epidemics and the impact of the interventions. (48-52) With close to 747 million SIM
connections in Sub-Saharan Africa, representing 74% of the population on the continent, (53) the
response to the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for countries to retool their data collection
systems to meet their surveillance needs.
In addition, the mobile digital technologies could enable confidential self-reporting of symptoms to
healthcare providers’, catalyzing further investigation and epidemic control measures before it spreads
beyond defined population subgroups. As an information and health communication tool, mobile
platforms could also be leveraged to deliver appropriate health messages to the population, relieving
direct consultation pressure from health system providers.
Efficient resource allocation and use is only feasible where there is improved visibility across the various
components of the health system through high quality health information systems. (54) Ideally, this
should cover key areas such as human resources for health, infrastructure and equipment, medicines
and other health commodities, and financial resources available. This is particularly needed in epidemic
situations, where there are often huge distortions in demand for resources, that if not well addressed
could lead to wastage and suboptimal population health outcomes.
Lastly, but equally important in the African context, the global health community and governments
addressing the COVID-19 pandemic should be inclusive in their efforts because the efficacy of a response
to any emergency is only as good as its weakest link. It is therefore important that governments include
marginalized communities, such as refugees, migrants and internally displaced populations (IDPs) in
their policies and actions. Across Africa, approximately 12.3 million people remain forcibly displaced,
including 8.1 million internally displaced people and 4.2 million refugees. (55) Moreover, Sub-Saharan
Africa alone hosts more than 26% of the world’s refugee population. (56- 57) These populations are
likely to face a different set of constraints that restricts their ability to prevent themselves from getting
infected and accessing health care. The fact that they also live in under difficult circumstances means
that governments across the region should maintain critical supply corridors for humanitarian assistance
and address the needs of the most vulnerable within their borders. In the longer term this pandemic
should also be a call for African governments to further strengthen engagement with international
humanitarian actors in order to foster strong partnership building on local capacities. Within this supranational context, the issue of ‘livelihood corridor’ also needs to be looked at carefully and more broadly,
given that AfCFTA (the African Continental Free Trade Agreement) which is expected to govern trade

and flow of goods and services in the region will come into effect on July 1 2020 (African Union 2020).
Hence, current and planned NPIs in the region need to consider such regional initiatives to ensure that
responses to the pandemic at country and regional level are coherent and able to balance saving the
lives and livelihood of the people of the African continent.

V.

CONCLUSIONS

It is true that some of the most successful responses to global health threats including recent ones like
Ebola and HIV/AIDS have been characterized by multi-stakeholder partnerships. African health
systems have been in the forefront in the implementation of such programs and would be best served
to leverage that experience and resources in responding to COVID-19. Bringing all stakeholders
together to ensure effective coordination, pooling of resources and delivery of evidence-based
interventions is imperative for any sustainable response to such pandemic situations.
Within, the African context, policy makers should also consider (a) impact of strategies that could
potentially deepen health inequalities and (b) continuously use data driven approaches to identifying
their unique most at risk/vulnerable groups e.g. IDP, HIV positive, food insecure to support them in
an equitable manner and bring them into the COVID-19 prevention framework. At a time of a
pandemic no one community can be marginalized.
Finally, in as much as health systems are dealing with an emerging situation, measurement is a
fundamental tool to guide strategic response actions. The measurement framework should be agile yet
comprehensive, rather than being piecemeal. It should seek to combine data from multiple sources
within the healthcare system into a joint assessment framework such that a consistent and informative
narrative emerges to tackle the epidemic. The age-old call for accurate health metrics to address
population health still remains valid. Our best estimates presented in the paper are a forecast, and their
ability to capture reality is as good as the underlying data. It is thus imperative to review the model
and the results as new data becomes available and update the estimates accordingly.
