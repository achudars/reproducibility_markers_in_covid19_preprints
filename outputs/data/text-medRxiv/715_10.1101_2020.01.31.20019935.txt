Abstract: As the outbreak of novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) progresses within
China and beyond, there is a need for rapidly available epidemiological data to guide
situational awareness and intervention strategies. Here we present an effort to compile
epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician
community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak
entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and
internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics,
hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We
find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally,
compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid
progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local
transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children
under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or
behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since
Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a
week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is
important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling
teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.
Introduction:
As the outbreak of novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rapidly expanding in China and
beyond, threatening to become a worldwide pandemic 1, there is a need for real-time
analyses of epidemiological data to increase situational awareness and inform
interventions 2. In the past, real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility,
severity, and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak
3-6
. Analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key
epidemiologic parameters, such as the incubation and infectious periods, and lags in
detection, isolation, and reporting of cases 3,4. However, individual patient data rarely

become publicly available in the first weeks of an outbreak, when the information is most
needed.
Building on prior experience collating news reports to monitor Ebola transmission 7,
here we present an effort to compile individual patient information and subnational
epidemic curves on 2019-nCoV from a variety of online resources. Data were made
publicly available in real-time and were used by the infectious disease modeling
community to generate and compare epidemiological estimates relevant for interventions.
Here we describe the process to compile data and provide an early analysis of the
demographics, hospitalization, and reporting lags, in different provinces of China and
internationally as of Jan 30, 2020.
Method:
2019-nCoV data compilation:
We used crowdsourced reports from DXY.cn, a Chinese online community network for
physicians, health care professionals, pharmacies and healthcare facilities established in
2000 8. An online platform provides real-time coverage of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in
China, obtained by collating and curating reports from news media, government TV,
national and provincial health agencies. The information reported includes time-stamped
cumulative case counts of 2019-nCoV, outbreak maps, and real-time streaming of health
authority announcements in Chinese (directly or through state media) 9. Every report is
linked to an on-line source, which can be followed through for more detailed information
on individual cases.
We closely monitored updates on DXY.cn between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020 to
extract key information on individual patients in near real-time, as well as daily reported
case counts. For individual-level patient information, we used descriptions from the
original source in Chinese to retrieve age, gender, province of identification, travel history,
reporting date, date of symptom onset and hospitalization, and discharge status, when
available. Individual level data were formatted into a line-list database for further
quantitative analysis. Individual-level patient data were entered from DXY.cn by a native
Chinese speaker (KS), who also generated an English summary for each case. Entries
were doubled checked by a second person (JC). Since DXY.cn primarily provides
information on cases reported in China, we also compiled additional information on
internationally exported cases from global news media.
Further, we reconstructed the daily progression of reported cases in each province
of China from Jan 18, 2020 to Jan 30, 2020. We used the daily outbreak situation reports
communicated by provincial health authorities, covered by state TV and media, and
posted on DXY.cn. All cases in our databases are laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV
patients.
The database was made available as a Google sheet disseminated via Twitter on
Jan 21, 2020 and posted on a university website on Jan 24, 2020 10.

Statistical Analysis.
We assessed the age distribution of 2019-nCoV cases by discharge status, adjusted
for the demographics of the Chinese population. We used 2016 population estimates from
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 11 to calculate the relative risk (RR) of 2019nCoV infection by age group, following Lemaitre et al 12. The RR for age group # is defined
as:
(%
,%
$$% = '
*/'
*
∑% (%
∑% ,%
Where (% is the number of cases in group # and ,% is the population of age group #.
To estimate trends in the strength of case detection and interventions, we analyzed
delays between symptom onset and visit to a healthcare provider, at a hospital or clinic,
and from hospitalization to reporting, by time period and location. We considered the
period before and after Jan 18, 2020, when media attention and awareness of the
outbreak became more pronounced 13. Further, intense travel restrictions in and out of the
Wuhan region were put in place starting Jan 22, 2020 13.
Results
Patients characteristics
Our line list comprised 288 cases reported between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 29, 2020
including 200 cases from mainland China and 88 international cases (Table 1). The
gender ratio was skewed towards male (63%). Within mainland China, there was a large
representation of 5 of the 30 provinces, with 17% of cases reported from Hubei (capital,
Wuhan), 13% from Shanxi, 8.8% from Tianjin, and 7% each from Yunnan and Beijing.
Most cases had a travel history to Wuhan (42%) or where residents of Wuhan (44%),
while 14% had no direct relation to Wuhan.
The age distribution of cases was skewed towards older age groups with a median of
44 years for cases who were alive or with unknown outcome at the time of reporting
(Figure 1A). The median age of 2019-nCoVcases who had died at the time of reporting
was 70 years. Few cases (n=7, 2.4%) were under 15 years of age. Adjustment for the age
demographics of China confirmed a deficit of cases among children, with a RR below 0.3.
in individuals under 15 years (Figure 1).The RR measure pointed at a sharp increase in
the likelihood of reported 2019-nCoV infection starting at age 30 yrs.
Epidemic timelines in Mainland China, nationally and at provincial level
A timeline of cases in our crowdsourced patient line list is shown by date of onset
in Figure 2, indicating an acceleration of reported cases by Jan 13, 2020. The outbreak
progression based on the crowdsourced patient line list is consistent with the timeline
published by China CDC on Jan 29th, based on a more comprehensive database of more
than 6,000 2019-nCoVcases (Figure 2). Comparison of cumulative curves shows that the
crowdsourced dataset captured a larger fraction of the cases reported to China CDC
before Jan 18, 2020 than in more recent days. The very recent slowing down of cumulative
cases apparent in the crowdsourced and China CDC curves is likely a reflection of the
delay between disease onset and reporting, estimated at a median of 5 days in our data
(range 0-43 days).

The subnational growth of the epidemic in China is shown by reporting date in
Figure 3. As of Jan 30, 2020, 14 of the 30 provinces had already reported more than 100
confirmed cases. The apparent rapid growth of newly reported cases in many of the
provinces outside of Hubei is consistent with sustained local transmission.
Hospitalization and reporting delays in mainland China
The median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 3
days in mainland China (IQR 0-15 days) (Figure 4). This delay declined from 5 to 2 days
before and after Jan 18, 2020 (Wilcoxon test, p=0.03). Some provinces, such as Tianjin
and Yunnan had shorter delays, while the early cases from Wuhan were characterized by
longer seeking care delays.
The median delay between hospitalization and reporting was 3 days (IQR 2-5 days) in
mainland China and declined from 9 to 2 days after Jan 18th, 2020 (Wilcoxon test,
P<0.0001, Figure 4). Similar to hospitalization delays, reporting was quickest in Tianjin
and Yunnan and slowest in Hubei province.
Hospitalization and reporting delays for international travelers outside mainland China
The median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic
was 0 days (range 0-9 days) for international travelers, shorter than for cases in Hubei or
the rest of mainland China (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.0001, Figure 4). Even in the period
after Jan 18, 2020, when awareness of the outbreak increased, there was a shorter
hospitalization delay for international cases than for those from mainland China (p<0.001).
Further, for international cases, the delay between hospitalization and reporting was 2
days (IQR 0-12 days), also shorter than for mainland China (p<0.0001).

Discussion
Information from patient line-lists is crucial but difficult to obtain at the beginning of
an outbreak. Here we have shown that careful compilation of crowdsourced reports
curated by a long-standing Chinese clinician network provides a valuable picture of the
outbreak in real-time. The outbreak timeline is consistent with aggregated case counts
provided by health authorities (for comparison, China CDC published the first epidemic
curve by symptom onset on Jan 29, 2020 14). The line list provides information on the lag
between symptom onset and detection by the healthcare system, reporting delays, and
travel history, which is not available from aggregated case counts published by official
sources. Crowdsourced data can contribute to assessment of the effectiveness of
interventions and the potential for widespread local transmission beyond the initial foci of
infection. In particular, shorter delays between symptoms onset and hospitalization
accelerate detection and isolation of cases, effectively shortening the infectious period.
Perhaps the most useful feature of our crowdsourced database was a careful curation
of travel histories for patients returning from Wuhan, which, along with dates of symptom
onset, allowed for precise estimation of the incubation period 15,16. A narrow window of
exposure can be defined for a subset of cases who had a short stay in Wuhan, at a time
when the epidemic was still localized to Wuhan. Several teams have used ours and other

datasets to estimate an incubation period of 5-6 days for 2019-nCoV (95% CI 2-11 dys)
15-18
. This is a useful parameter to guide isolation and contact tracing; the disease status
of a contact should be known with near certainty after a period of observation of 14 days
15
. Availability of a public dataset enables independent estimation of important
epidemiological parameters by several modeling teams, allowing for confirmation and
cross-checking at a time when information can be conflicting and noisy.
Another interesting finding in our data is the age distribution of cases. There is a heavy
skew of reported 2019-nCoV cases towards older age groups, with a marked deficit of
children. This pattern could point at age-related differences in susceptibility to infection,
severe outcomes, or behavior. On one hand, a substantial portion of the cases in our
database are from travelers, a population which tends to be skewed towards adults
(although it does not exclude children). Further, because cases in our dataset were
captured by the health system, they are biased towards the more severe spectrum of the
disease, especially for cases from Mainland China. Clinical reports have shown that 2019nCoV severity is associated with the presence of chronic conditions 18,19, which are more
frequent in older age groups. Nevertheless, we would also expect very young patients to
be at risk of severe outcomes and to be reported to the healthcare system, as is seen for
other respiratory infections 20.
Biological differences could play a role in driving these age profiles. Detailed
analysis of one of the early 2019-nCoV clusters suggests that all household members
were infected, except for a baby, hinting at true biological differences in the risk of infection
driven by age 21. It has been speculated that prior immunity from infection with related
coronaviruses may protect children from SARS infection 22, which could also play a role
for 2019-nCoV. In any case, if the age distribution of cases reported here was to be
confirmed and the epidemic were to progress regionally and globally, we would expect a
rise in respiratory mortality concentrated among ages 30 and above. This mortality pattern
would be markedly different from the profile of 2009 influenza pandemic, where excess
mortality was concentrated in those under 65 years 23.
The age profile of 2019-nCoVcases is reminiscent of SARS infections, for which a deficit
of children was also noted 22,24. The SARS epidemic was characterized by a concentration
of cases among health care workers due to super-spreading events occurring in
healthcare facilities 22. We do not see a large fraction of health care workers in the data
currently available for 2019-nCoV, although one large cluster was reported in Wuhan (not
captured in our data).
Based on our data, the timeline of the outbreak indicates rapid growth in several
provinces of China, consistent with local transmission outside of Wuhan. At this point,
province-level epidemic curves are only available by date of reporting, rather than date of
symptoms, which tends to inflate recent case counts if detection has increased. Further,
these province-level curves include both returning travelers from Wuhan (importations)
and locally acquired cases, which contribute to overestimate the potential for local
transmission. It is worth noting that other lines of evidence suggest that local transmission
is now well-established outside of Wuhan, as travel increased just before the Chinese
New Year and before the ban was implemented in Wuhan 10,25. Accordingly, in our line list,

we have information on a few local transmission clusters reported outside of Wuhan. For
instance, there is evidence of second-generation transmission in Shanxi on Jan 21, 2020.
We recognize that our data source is useful and timely but should not replace official
statistics. Manual compilation of detailed line lists from media sources is highly time
consuming, and it is not sustainable when case counts reach several thousands. Here we
provide detailed data on 288 patients when the official case count is over 7000 (as of Jan
30, 2020) 10, representing a sample of ~4% of all reported cases. At the time of this writing,
efforts are underway to coordinate compilation of 2019-nCoV cases from on-line sources
across various modeling teams. Ultimately, we expect that a line list of patients will be
shared by government sources with the global community; however, data cleaning and
access issues may take prohibitively long to resolve. For the West African Ebola outbreak,
it took 2 years until publication of a line list 26. Given the progression of the 2019-nCoV
outbreak, such a long delay would be counterproductive.
In conclusion, crowdsourced epidemiological data can be useful to monitor emerging
outbreaks, such as 2019-nCoV (see also 7 for a related study in the context of Ebola).
These efforts can help generate and disseminate detailed information to the scientific
community, particularly in the early stages of an outbreak when little else is available,
enabling independent estimation of key parameter estimates that affect interventions.
Based on our small sample of 2019-nCoV cases, we see an intriguing age distribution,
reminiscent of that of SARS, which warrants further epidemiologic and serologic studies.
We also report early signs that the response is strengthening in China based on a
decrease in case detection time, and rapid management of travel-related cases that are
identified internationally. As a caveat, this is an early report of a rapidly evolving situation
and the parameters discussed here could change quickly. In the coming weeks, we will
continue to monitor the epidemiology of this outbreak using data from news reports and
official sources.
