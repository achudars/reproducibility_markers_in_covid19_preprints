Title: Tele-Rehabilitation for Visually Challenged Students during COVID-19 Pandemic:
Lesson learned

Abstract:
Background: The COVID-19 outbreak poses a global crisis in health care delivery system,
including habilitation and rehabilitation services. In the present study, we shared our experiences
on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD)
amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs. Methods: Following the lockdown declared on
March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received
information that many VCS were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with
anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was
set-up for tele-facilities. The intended services was explained while disseminating the mobile
numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to
record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the
qualitative information. Results: As of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team,
with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers
were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs
were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium
among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of
transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight
concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis. Conclusion: Tele-rehabilitation
provides valuable insights and has the potential to address various concerns, uncertainty, anxiety,
and fear among SVD during the pandemic.

Introduction
The current Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges not only in the provision
of health care services but also habilitation and rehabilitation for persons with visual disabilities
(PwVDs). The traditional way of practices like physical visits by patients or face to face
consultation may pose with risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus either from the providers to
the patients or vice versa. As a result, there has been a global paradigm shift in delivering health
care services using digital technologies in the form of telehealth or telemedicine or
teleconsultation. [1, 2, 3] As of today, August 1, 2020, the natural history of the COVID-19,
including its pathophysiology and scale of the route for transmission, though reported to be
respiratory droplets, and long term health consequences have not been fully yet known. [4], On
the other hand, the Government of India imposed many steps to limit the transmission of the
virus, for example, complete or partial lockdown, closure of outpatients service of the hospitals,
and transportations, etc. causing tremendous challenges in accessing healthcare services to
public as well as disabled people.[5, 6] In such unpredictable circumstances, the continued care
for PwVDs in the form of telerehabilitation without increasing the risk of exposure to COVID19 on healthcare or PwVDs is of overwhelming importance. Indeed, the continuation of services
is critically important since PwVDs are likely to be more susceptible and may have serious
health consequences if they contract with COVID-19.[7]
In general, vision rehabilitation service is not very urgent, but need a long interaction with
patients, either in the form of counselling and education or one to one rehabilitation training with
close contact. Since COVID-19 pandemic started in January 2020, an alternative way of
providing rehabilitation service has been gaining a lot of attention in the form of
telerehabilitation, besides teleconsultation using digital technologies across the world.

[8]

Telerehabilitation, unlike tele-medicine or tele-consultation in which medical consultation on
diagnosis, treatment, and preventive practices are primarily involved, is an alternative strategy to
help in accessing rehabilitation services using information and communication technologies
amongst persons with disabilities (PwDs).[9,10,11] Studies are reported on successful ophthalmic
practices using tele-consultation facilities during the COVID-19 lockdown in India.[12,13]

Tele-rehabilitation for persons with disabilities, including visually challenged addresses, but not
limited to, a range of habilitation and rehabilitation services that includes education, telecounselling, consultation, monitoring, supervision, patient’s functional assessment, preventive
measures, various rehabilitation therapy or intervention, training and demonstration to patients or
caregivers as well as clinical management to a certain level, etc.

[14,15]

The communication

between a disabled individual and rehabilitation professionals can be done with a variety of
telecommunications platforms such a telephone, messaging, internet-based audio or
videoconferencing, transferring of data to the rehabilitation professionals.[8] The main advantages
of telerehabilitation ensures theunnecessary travel to the hospital and maintain social distancing
during the COVID 19 pandemic.
Methodology
How was the tele-rehabilitation service conceived amidst the COVID-19 pandemic?
Shortly following the nationwide emergency lockdown, declared on March 23, 2020, the team
of Vision Rehabilitation &Training Center (VR&TC) of a tertiary eye care centre in north India
noticed that many SwVD were stranded at schools for the blind (residential) or vocational
training centers in National Capital Regions, India. The team immediately contacted and
discussed with the authorities of few leading schools for the blind and Non-Government
Organizations (NGOs) about the need of telerehabilitation or teleconsultation during the
pandemic lockdown. We also discussed the feasibility of telerehabilitation services, accessibility
of smartphones among students or so, and the prospects of services. The team did a trial with a
few students and took the feedback about the need for such an initiative during the pandemic. On
April 20, 2020, tele-rehabilitation was started and shared the contact numbers to the
representative of NGOs and schools. We shared the experiences that we learned from the telerehabilitation services that was set up for SwVD during the COVID-19 lockdown in the present
paper.

Setting up and equipment for tele-rehabilitation
The team used three smartphones and two tablets for the services. Audio based, VoIP (Voice
over Internet Protocol like WhatsApp calling, online Zoom platform), and messaging were the
various communication platforms that were used for communication. A dedicated room used for
vision rehabilitation before the pandemic was designed for the purpose. Mobile numbers, the
details of working hours for consultation were disseminated to the authorities of various
organizations. A rehabilitation team primarily consisting of faculty members, a Ph.D. scholar
with qualification in MBBS, MD, two rehabilitation staff who have been working for the last 5
years were involved in the telerehabilitation. The team aimed to receive all calls from clients.
The term ‘clients’ indicated all recipients of telerehabilitation services irrespective of whether
callers are beneficiaries (disabled individuals) or caregivers or parents or family members of
disabled child. All callers may not be beneficiaries. For example, if a parent (caller) called the
team for his or her children having retinopathy of prematurity (beneficiary). If the team missed
any call, a call back was done to the same number. Follow up calls were also made to know the
status or whereabout of PwVDs.
The faculty who looks after vision rehabilitation educated and trained for a day to all the team
about COVID-19 information, e.g. cause, symptoms, mode of transmission, etc., and preventive
measures along with techniques using various sources like The Centre for Diseases Control and
Prevention, The Department of Health and Human Services, USA; The World Health
Organization and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, etc. Using these
sources will help to provide the scientific and reliable information about COVID-19. The
training also included about rapport building of the clients and filling out the form. These
educational materials were made available in the tele-room for ready references.
Intended services in tele-rehabilitation
In the present telerehabilitation services, we did not intend to provide all the components since it
was not feasible during the emergency COVID-19 lockdown, rather aimed for education and
counselling, monitoring if any VCS visits to the centre earlier, problem-solving communication
to clients’ uncertainty, training and demonstration about preventive measures to caregivers or

family members as well as supportive supervision during the lockdown period. We also aimed to
facilitate healthcare access through the hospital telemedicine and emergency services if required
as well as management of some minor ailments as per the Govt. of India’s telemedicine
guidelines. If any caller seeking for further health care, including ocular problems, not only we
advised to contact the concerned hospital teleconsultation services, but also facilitate to avail the
tele-facilities or emergency healthcare.

Study tool
A semi-structured questionnaire was used for the study that consisted of closed and open-ended
questions (Annexure 1). An example of open-ended was “what are your concerns or worries
during COVID-19 pandemic? The information received was written on the space provided in the
tool. A remark or action taken if required was also present. Each caller was explained about the
information that we would like to obtain during the tele-rehabilitation. Since, it was not possible
to have a written consent, an implied consent of the callers was considered as the call was
initiated from the clients. We relied on the information provided by the clients.
The tool was pretested to five initial clients to standardize and made necessary changes
thereafter. While developing the tool, the following steps were followed to standardize it.
Firstly, we reviewed for any existing similar tool, 2nd-develop an initial draft in consultation with
other experts (faculty members), 3rd-the same was pre-tested to non-study clients; 4th-checking
the languages, wording, clarity, easy or difficult to understand, including layout; 5th- input all
coding and finalized it. For instance, during the process we removed the question on cause of
visual impairment, or avoided the address detailed or revised the list of common ailments.
Data analysis
Since we used semi-structured recording forms for the study, the quantitative information was
presented descriptively, e.g. frequency, percentage, calculated using STATA-15
(StataCorp.2015.Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, Tx: StataCorp LP),
whereas inductive content analysis was done for the qualitative information based on Thomas’s
method manually. [16] Inductive analysis was performed to gain meaningful information received

or to understand more insights. The process consists of five steps. Firstly, initial reading of text
data or information; secondly, identification of specific text segments relevant to objectives;
third, labeling the segments of the text to create categories or theme; fourth, reducing overlap
and redundancy among categories, and fifth, creating a model incorporating most important
categories. A total of three researchers have participated in the process of analysis. For
trustworthiness and credibility, a series of debates among researchers as well as consistency
checking was done in case of disagreement in the analysis process. To further ensure the
trustworthiness, “the quotes” from the callers/beneficiaries are reported in the results.

Results:
As of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 calls were received from different parts of the country with a
maximum from Delhi (41.5%) followed by Uttar Pradesh (23.6%). The male callers were 78.8%,
nearly two-thirds of them owned a smartphone, and 43.3% of callers/beneficiaries made the call
without any assistant. Around 96% of the callers belonged to visually disabled, with 16.5% of
the callers’ visual status were unknown (waiting or applied for certificates). The majority of
callers/beneficiaries belonged to age group between 11 to 30 years (82.3%) and were students
(80.3%, Table 1).
Presenting complaints or seeking for health care from callers or beneficiaries
Besides the various concerns on COVID-19 pandemic, around 47.9% of clients (235) reported
physical health problems with a total complained of 335 among beneficiaries The three most
frequently presenting complaints were itching in the eyes (36.1% of overall complaints),
headache (29.0% of complaints) and watering in eyes (16.1%, Table 2). The minimum
complaints received from callers was redness in the eyes (1.5% of the total).
Awareness and knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic.
A total of 722 responses from 491 callers were recorded when we asked what media help to get
the information on COVID-19 disease. Television news is the most frequently reported medium
to receive about the pandemic (59.4% of all responses) and followed by friends or peers (9.6%)

and using mobile internet data (7.9%, Table 3). When we enquired about the mode of
transmission of disease, transmission by the contact or touch is the most frequent response
(36.4%; 408 out of 1122), followed by sneezing (35.2% of total responses, Table 3). In the
context of preventive strategies from COVID 19 diseases, social distancing (41.6%; 470 out of
1136) and wearing a face mask (41.2%) were frequent responses from the callers.
Findings from the inductive content analysis
The intent of inductive content analysis (ICA) was to gain insights of qualitative information
based on the open-ended question on concerns or worries due to the pandemic. We recorded
responses from 290 consecutive callers about their concerns and problems faced during the
COVID -19 pandemic. This optimum sample size was guided by the degree to which incoming
qualitative information adequately answer the questions.[17] So, we avoided further recording of
the concerned information because there was no or a little newly added meaningful information
(data saturation). Such data saturation for estimating sample size is a valid method in collecting
qualitative information.[18] The following various categories were revealed and were facilitated
through the Tele-rehabilitation to clients. There were eight themes or categories that emerged: 1)
The COVID-19 disease related, 2) The lockdown related, 3) Health-related, 4) Livelihood
related, 5) Education related, 6) Social related, 7) Certificates related, and 8) Empowerment
related (Table 4).

Services and assistance

Clients were educated about COVID-19: sign and symptoms, mode of transmission, potential
source of sites or surfaces, preventive measures like wearing of face masks, handwashing.
Counselling was actively done to reduce the anxiety and panic felt; follow up calls were made as
a part of monitoring; online audio-video based teaching or demonstration on technique of
handwashing, wearing of masks; management of some minor ailments as per the Govt. of India
guidelines; group meeting using online platform, e.g. Zoom; and yoga sessions were a part of the
tele-rehabilitation services. The team assisted in accessing healthcare needs either through the
hospital tele-medicine or informed the clients about the emergency facilities available with a

subsequent communication to patients who had been facilitated earlier. For example, the team
recontacted a SwVD with a severe pain abdomen who was facilitated to access an emergency
services during the lockdown.

There were services for problem-solving that the team had never thought of, for instance, few
visually challenged students/persons who came to Delhi for a new disability certificates or for
renewal or vocational training were not able to get a place to stay during the lockdown, our team
coordinated with available residential vocational training centers or schools, and arranged a place
to stay for temporarily; advised to family members and village leaders to allow for home
isolation rather than village quarantine facilities for SwVDs who returned to their respective
villages; even the team helped SwVDs to locate misplaced households items with smartphone
applications, etc.

Discussion
The world has been facing a crisis on health care delivery system since the WHO announced the
pandemic of COVID-19 disease in March 11, 2020, with over 35.2 million confirmed cases and
over a million deaths from 235 countries as of October 5, 2020.[19] Following this
announcement, the routine conventional face to face healthcare practices suffers a great
disruption, and suddenly gaining due attention with telehealth practices employing user friendly
electronic communication technologies. Such tele-health services was shown to be useful in
previous outbreaks like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, Ebola and Zika viruses. [20]
Among various modalities of telehealth, tele-rehabilitation has been shown to be useful in
morbidities like stroke, diabetes, cancer, neurological problems, patients with cardiac or
musculoskeletal problems. [21,22,23,24]Tele-rehabilitation for visual impairment (low vision and
blind) can be considered as a subset of under the umbrella tele-rehabilitation services. The goal
of vision rehabilitation whether in person or remotely via tele-rehabilitation, is to improve visual
functioning, and daily living activities, including instrumental activities as well as social and
psychological well-being among PwVDs. Evidence exists that the usefulness of such tele9

(vision) rehabilitation services in improving the overall life functioning and quality of life among
people with low vision and blindness.[10] However, the present telerehabilitation established
during the COVID-19 emergency lockdown is primarily to alleviate the fear and panic felt
among SwVDs. Though the team could not provide all components of tele-rehabilitation, a wide
range of feasible services, including training and demonstration of COVID-19 preventive
measures are covered. The team also helps in solving previously unexpected problems for
PwVDs during the lockdown. Traditionally, the rehabilitation services is delivered to PwDs by a
multidisciplinary team of trained personnel. Similarly, the present tele-(vision) rehabilitation
service is involved a team of trained staff of a tertiary eye care hospital with SwVDs as target
audiences.

The results show that most of the callers are students (80.3% of the total) with male predominant
(78.8%). This finding corresponds to what teleconsultation services intended. The male
predominance among callers could be because in most of these schools for the blind are
predominantly occupied by male students than their female counterparts. Other factors could be
female students with visual disabilities are not having smartphones or reluctance to call a male
rehabilitation staff, since we do not have a female rehabilitation staff. Around 56.9% of visually
disabled have a smartphone and 43.3% of beneficiaries dialed without any assistant (Table 1).
This information is important because these group of disabled are the potential candidates for
training on use special smartphone applications for visual impairment (VI) through telerehabilitation in the futureand study on the utilities of such applications. This gives an
opportunity for further services and research.
The result also indicates that around 16.5% of the callers do not have visual disability certificates
or not able to renew it or applied but not received yet. This finding is a concern because such
visually disabled cannot avail of various benefits without disability certificates provided by the
government during lockdown periods. For example, the Government of Delhi ensures financial
security to PwDs having disability certificates to the double amount during the lockdown.[25]

The team also received calls for health-related issues as a primary reason. The two most
frequently presenting eye or health problems were itching in the eyes and headache. These
findings are different from other teleconsultation studies reported from the north and south India
in which redness, blurring of vision, pain, and watering were common complaints. [13] The
difference could be on account of difference in morbidities since the callers or beneficiaries in
the present study are the population with a visual disability. The next frequent complaint was
headache among callers. Perhaps the headache may be related to the extensive use of
smartphones. An individual with a visual loss is more likely to use a mobile phone for a longer
time than people without a visual loss. Very few studies reported that a nonspecific of ill-health
like a headache is due to the effects of the radiofrequency electromagnetic field from a mobile
phone.[26,27]
Since the callers in present study already have a visual disability, they are likely to use the
smartphone for audio purposes, not for screen exposure to the eyes. Therefore, a further study is
warranted on whether the headache accounts due to exposure to the electromagnetic field emitted
by smartphone, not by screen exposure to the eyes.
The news on the Television channels is the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19
information. Since television is ubiquitous in every family or organization and the most
common medium to get information among PwVDs, it can also be a medium to reduce the
stigma, anxiety, and panic conceived during the pandemic. However, an accessible and
appropriate information system should widely be available that helps in reducing the fear felt
among PwVDs during the outbreak. Very few responses are received handwashing as a
preventive measure among the callers. They need to be educated about handwashing with
appropriate techniques as it is one of the best preventive steps from the COVID-19 virus.
Table 4 shows that not only concerns of PwVDs about COVID-19, but also they worry about
other aspects of lives during the pandemic, for example, feeling of anxiety and fear while buying
foods or groceries items, challenges in finding accommodation during the lockdown, the
compounded social stigma against them or the fear of losing job, etc.

During such a pandemic followed by a severe health care delivery crisis, visually disabled are
needed to be informed and educated about COVID -19 along with various preventive strategies
like need of changing behavior, social distancing, avoid public gathering, wearing of face or
medical masks, avoiding unnecessary touch, etc. A platform in the form of tele- (vision)
rehabilitation in every eye care facility across the country is required so that PwVDs can obtain
the necessary awareness and knowledge about the COVID-19.
Performing a regular yoga sessions through online platforms, connecting with friends and family
members, and rehabilitation professionals, sharing experiences and help to each other among
visually disabled, conducting online group meeting, avoid listening news channels obsessively
are some of the useful activities to reduce anxiety fear and surrounding uncertainty during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The team organized such activities as a part of remedy. Obtaining the
information only from trustworthy and reliable sources such the government website,
rehabilitation professionals, and the World Health Organization is critically important to avoid
any misinformation. Not only this, PWVDs should be learned about food safety, handling daily
groceries items though tele-(vision) rehabilitation services.
Limitations
The study has few limitations. Neither we could do any physical verification of associated
disability nor assessed the degree of disability. We relied on the caller’s response through phone
for their type and degree of disability. Around 16.5% of callers who are not having certificates
that the team could not get information on disabilities. As a service limitation, we could not
provide all components of rehabilitation which are potentially feasible through tele-facilities.

Conclusions
Since the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the WHO on March 11, 2020, a global paradigm
shift in health care practices using information and communication technologies has been
gaining a lot of attention. While the conventional way of communicative health care practices,
i.e. direct face to face contact, poses a risk of exposure between providers and patients, tele(vision) rehabilitation offers a safe and an efficient way of providing all reliable information of

COVID-19, including various preventive strategies among visually disabled. The platform also
helps in psychological counselling for fear and panic, facilitating and addressing the many
unseen challenged faced by visually disabled. However, many developing countries, including
India, lack a regulatory framework to establish such digital services into the health care system.
Based on the experiences we presented here, tele-(vision) rehabilitation particularly for people
visual disabilities can be considered as an essential service wherever vision rehabilitation clinic
exists.
