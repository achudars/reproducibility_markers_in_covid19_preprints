Seroprevalence and epidemiological characteristics of immunoglobulin M
and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people in Wuhan,
China: a cross-sectional study
Abstract:
Objectives Population screening for IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 was initiated on
March 25 and was open to all residents of Wuhan who were symptom-free. All ages
with no fever, headache or other symptoms of COVID-19 among residents in Wuhan
were included.
Methods This study adopted a cross-sectional study. Pearson Chi-square test, T-test, and
Mann-Whitney test were used in comparison between different groups. To correct the
effects of gender and age, the seroprevalence of IgM positivity, IgG positivity, and IgM
and/or IgG positivity were standardized according to the gender and age-specific
population of Wuhan in 2017.
Results The seroprevalence of IgG and IgM standardized for age and gender in Wuhan
showed a downward trend. No significant correlation was observed between the
seroprevalence of IgG and the different age groups. The seroprevalence was
significantly higher for females than males (x2 =35.702, p < 0.001), with an odds ratio of
1.36 (95% CI: 1.24–1.48). A significant difference was seen in the seroprevalence of
IgG among people from different geographic areas and different types of workplaces
(respectively, x2 = 42.871, p < 0.001 and x2 = 202.43, p < 0.001). The IgG antibodypositive cases had a greater number of abnormalities in CT imaging than IgG-negative
cases (30.7% vs 19.7%).
Conclusions Our work found the reported number of confirmed patients in Wuhan only
represents a small proportion of the total number of infections. There was a significant
aggregation of asymptomatic infections in individuals from some occupations, and based
on CT and laboratory findings, some damage may have occurred in asymptomatic
individuals positive for IgG antibody.

Strengths and limitations of this study:

 This study has the important feature of having been designed as repeated
five-day serosurveys, which allowed for the monitoring of seroprevalence
progression.
 This study applied scientific statistical methods accounting for the
demographic structure of the general population and imperfect diagnostic
tests to estimate seroprevalence in the overall population.
 This study had selection bias since the analyzed medical records were based
on examinees directed by their work units.
 People under the age of 19 and over age 65 were too few to be fully covered
in analyses.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic that has spread around the globe in the early
months of 2020.[1-2] Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis for SARS-CoV-2 is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis.[3-4] However,
epidemiological surveillance of confirmed COVID-19 cases captures only a portion of all
infections because the clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from mild to the
onset of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.[5] Many patients can be asymptomatic,
greatly increasing the uncertainty of diagnosis.[6] We know that SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies appear around 3–10 days after infection, with IgM appearing first and IgG
following around 14 days after infection.[7] Even after the symptoms of infection disappear,
IgG can still show seropositivity.[8] Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are a good
supplementary method to verify nucleic acid detection.[9]
A series of serological surveys of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.[10-17] However,
many of them are small or based on non-random sampling of participants, some of them
focusing on health-care workers or blood donors, and thus cannot provide precise estimates of
seroprevalence by age group in the general population.[18] Additionally, most of these studies
do not take into account the sensitivity or specificity of the antibody tests, or do not adjust for
the age and gender of the general population, which decreases the accuracy of the estimation.
The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China.[19] As Wuhan accepted the timely prevention strategies of lockdown for curbing
population flow, it effectively controlled the spread of the pandemic. After 76 days of
lockdown in Wuhan, the city reopened again on April 8, 2020. The residents have been
allowed to resume working since that day if they met a set of COVID-19-associated tests,
including SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests (NAT) of nasopharyngeal swabs, chest CT scans or

a SARS-CoV-2-specific serological test.[20-21] Serological surveys are the best tool to
determine the spread of an infectious disease, particularly in the presence of asymptomatic
cases.[22] These tests provide a unique opportunity to study the number of SARS-CoV-2
infections in the asymptomatic general population.
We choose a general hospital in Jianghan District near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale
Market to conduct a serological survey of those people resuming work and other inhabitants in
Wuhan using a validated assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We chose
this area because the Jianghan District was the early epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in
China and many of the earliest COVID-19 cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood
Wholesale Market in the same district of Wuhan.[23] We selected a serology test that has been
fully validated using serum from confirmed COVID-19-infected individuals and wellcharacterized reference samples. In this study, we analyzed 18,712 medical examination
records at this hospital including IgM and IgG tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and other
tests from March 25 to April 28, 2020. More than half of the individuals came from the
Jianghan District, while others came from different urban and rural areas and different
populations in Wuhan. All of them were healthy people with no fever, headache or other
symptoms of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of immunoglobulin M and
G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people in Wuhan, taking into account test
performance and adjusting for the age and gender of Wuhan’s population. We also describe
the epidemiological characteristics of seroprevalence in its geographic and occupational
distribution, as well as chest CT scan and laboratory findings from asymptomatic people. We
hope this study will provide a reference for estimating the number of asymptomatic cases of
COVID-19 and will improve our understanding of the epidemiology of the outbreak and the
development of immunity to COVID-19 in general populations.

METHODS
Subjects for serology testing
Before starting the screening for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we validated the serological
assay with serum samples from 105 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by a SARS-CoV-2
fluorescent PCR kit with nasopharyngeal swabs collected between January 18 and February 22,
2020 (Supplementary materials-Serology Test Validation).[24]
Population screening for IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 was initiated on March 25
and was open to all residents of Wuhan who were symptom-free (Figure S1). Most of them
had returned to work, but a few of them had contact with infected persons who were
asymptomatic visiting the designated hospital for COVID-19 diagnosing. The screening and
sample collection were carried out in the hospital; hence, the majority of participants resided in
the central districts of Wuhan. This was a cross-sectional study to investigate seroprevalence
in asymptomatic COVID-19 people in Wuhan for medical examinations. All people lived in
Wuhan since the city went into lockdown starting January 22, 2020.
Subject selection criteria: All ages with no fever, headache or other symptoms of
COVID-19 in whom specific IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected.
Exclusion criteria: No specific test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was completed or clinical data
was incomplete. From March 25 to April 28, 2020, a total of 18,712 (89.4%) people met the
inclusion criteria with a median age of 40 years (range 4–81 years old), including 11,391
males (60.9%) with a median age of 42 years and 7,321 females (39.1%) with a median age of
37 years.
Data collection
Clinical data were collected from March 25 to April 28, 2020, including birth date, gender,
occupation, residential district, date of test, serum IgG positivity and IgM positivity or

negative results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, nucleic acid testing, clinical symptoms, chest CT
and laboratory tests. Only 1636 of the subjects had chest CTand 12481 subjects had the
laboratory tests (Supplementary materials). SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kits (colloidal
gold method) were provided by INNOVITA (Tangshan, registration certificate for the medical
devices of Peoples Republic of China: 20203400177). All enrolled medical examiners
collected 2ml peripheral venous blood. After centrifugation, serum was taken for SARS-CoV2-specific IgG and IgM antibody detection within 2h. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs
used for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing were collected by trained and qualified medical
staff to perform NAT within 2h. The automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument was
provided by the Hangzhou Allsheng Instruments Co. Ltd. (Allsheng). The ABI-7500
fluorescence PCR instrument was from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. All operations were
carried out according to kit instructions.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 22.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk,
NY, USA), the R software package (version 3.6.2; 2019, The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing), and GraphPad Prism (Version 8.0, GraphPad Software, LLC, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Proportions for categorical variables were compared either by Pearson Chi-square test or by
Fisher’s Exact Test. Statistical analysis of continuous variables utilized means with standard
deviation (SD) for normally distributed data and medians with interquartile range (IQR) for
non-normally distributed data. Means for continuous variables were compared via independent
group t-tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was
used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To correct for the effects of gender and
age,[25] the seroprevalence of IgM positivity, IgG positivity, and IgM and/or IgG positivity
were standardized according to the gender and age-specific population of Wuhan in 2017

(Table S1). To correct for effects from accuracy of the serum antibody test, seroprevalence
was corrected according to the sensitivity and specificity of the colloidal gold test in previous
studies following the Rogan and Gladen method.[26]
RESULTS
Characteristics of individuals studies
Between March 26 and April 28, 2020, we enrolled a total of 18,712 asymptomatic
participants, most of them from 154 work units in the central urban area of Wuhan, with a
demographic distribution a little different from that of Wuhan (Figure S2). The proportion of
individuals under 19 and over 65 enrolled in the study was much smaller than the general
population. Among those enrolled, 11, 391 (60.9%) were male and 7,321 (39.1%) were female.
The median age of the subjects was 40.0 years (IQR, 42–50; range, 4–81), with the majority (n
= 17,367, 92.8%) aged 25 to 59 years. The cumulative count of the population tested for
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the number of positive cases of IgG and IgM are shown
in Figure 1.
Seroprevalence adjusting for age, gender and test
Table 1 shows the unadjusted and adjusted seroprevalence for IgG and IgM against SARSCoV-2 in asymptomatic people by gender. The unadjusted seroprevalence of IgG in females
was higher than in males and was significantly different (x2 =6.525, p = 0.011), resulting in an
odds ratio of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.05–1.45). The unadjusted seroprevalence of IgM in females was
slightly higher than in males, but was not significantly different (x2 =0.225, p = 0.635). When
IgG and IgM positivity were analyzed together, the unadjusted seroprevalence of IgG and /or
IgM in females was still higher than in males and was significantly different (x2 =7.191, p
=0.007), producing an odds ratio of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02–1.17).

After standardization according to the number of people of different ages and gender in
the population of Wuhan from the national census of 2017, the age- and gender-adjusted
seroprevalence of IgG was higher in females than in males and the difference was significant
(x2 = 20.433, p < 0.001), with an odds ratio of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.14–1.36). There was no
significant difference in IgM between females and males (x2 = 2.436, p = 0.119). The age- and
gender-adjusted seroprevalence of IgG and /or IgM was still higher in females than in males,
and the difference was significant (x2 = 21.906, p < 0.001), with an odds ratio of 1.25 (95% CI:
1.14–1.36).
However, after adjusting for age and gender, and adjusting for test performance
(sensitivity and specificity), the overall adjusted serum positive rate for IgG antibodies was
1.67% (95% CI: 1.49–1.85), 1.02% (0.84–1.20) for males and 2.35% (2.00–2.70) for females.
After similar adjustments, the overall adjusted serum positive rate for IgG and /or IgM
antibodies was 2.72% (95% CI: 2.49–2.95), 2.05% (1.79–2.31) for males and 3.41% (2.99–
3.83) for females, and the seroprevalence was significantly higher for females than males (x2 =
35.702, p < 0.001) at an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% CI: 1.24–1.48). The census indicated that the
Wuhan population aged 4–81 years in 2017 was 7,990,158. Based on this number,
asymptomatic COVID-19-positive individuals aged 4-81 years, using IgG and/or IgM
seroprevalence tests, were estimated at 217,332 (95% CI: 198,709–235,955) in Wuhan from
March 25 to April 28, 2020.
Distributions in time series and ages
Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics and seroprevalence of IgG and the odds ratio
arranged by time series. In the first five days, we estimated the seroprevalence of IgG at 3.82%
(95% CI: 2.18–5.47, n = 523). The estimate increased to 5.14% (4.08–6.19, n=1694) in the
second five days, to 8.43% (6.87–9.99, n=1222) in the third five days, and then decreased to

3.58% (3.01–4.16, n = 4046) in the fourth five days, to 2.79% (2.40–3.19, n=6695) in the fifth
five days, to 2.21% (1.64–2.78, n=2534) in the sixth five days, and finally to 1.45% (0.93–1.98,
n = 1998) in the seventh five days period. The positivity for IgM over the same time frame
declined slightly and remained at a low level, with the highest rate at 1.33% (0.35–2.32) in the
first five days, which dropped to a low of 0.28% (0.07–0.48) in the sixth five days period
(Table S2).

The distribution of the adjusted seroprevalence of IgG and IgM in the time series, and
the distribution of the crude seroprevalence of IgG and IgM in different age groups are in
Figure 2. The seroprevalence of IgG or IgM in different testing time periods was correlated
with the time periods (x2=153.88, p < 0.001; x2=17.075, p=0·009). Although none of the 26
individuals under the age of 19 years tested positive for IgG, no significant correlation was
observed between the seroprevalence of IgG and the different age groups (x2 = 11.541, p =
0.292). In contrast, the seroprevalence of IgM in different age groups was correlated with age
(x2 = 18.496, p = 0.035), showing a higher seroprevalence of IgM in the middle-aged group for
men and an increased seroprevalence with age for women. No IgM positivity was detected in
males or females under 24 years old. The positivity for IgM antibodies in males over 55 years
old was significantly lower than for females.
Geographic and occupational distribution of seroprevalence
Among the 154 work units, 57.8% (89/154) of work units had at least one positive case of IgG
or IgM among employees, accounting for 92.5% (17,315/18,712) of individuals receiving
serology testing, including in-service and partly retired employees. Approximately 60% of
antibody-positive cases came from the top ten work units having the most number of cases
(6.5%, 10/154), including a securities and insurance hall located in Jianghan District with a
higher risk for positive cases at 31.0% (9/29), a law firm located in Jiangan District with
positive rate of 27.4% (31/113), an urban construction company located in Jianghan District
with positive rate of 17.7% (6/34), and rural commercial banks with a positive rate of 7.7%
(34/444)). In particular, there was a bank branch with a positive rate of 15.3% (15/98) and two
community health service centers with positive rates of 5.06% (9/178), all of them located in
Jianghan District. In contrast, there were no positive cases found in serology tests of over 220
individuals from five other community health service centers located far from the central urban

area of Wuhan. There were three work units which contributed 30.3% (199/657) of the number
of antibody-positive individuals, including a water supply company, a real estate company
located in Jianghan District, and telecommunications companies located in Jianghan District.
The crude seroprevalence and odds ratio by geographic areas from different types of
workplaces are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. A significant difference was seen in
seroprevalence of IgG by urban area (x2 = 42.871, p < 0.001), but no significant difference was
observed for IgM (x2 = 14.729, p = 0.069). The Wuchang and Jianghan districts had higher
seroprevalence of IgG than other urban areas. Figure 3 shows the geographic distribution of
the seroprevalence of IgG or IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people from
March 25 to April 28, 2020, in Wuhan, China.

A significant difference was seen in the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM among people
from different work units (x2 = 202.43, p < 0.001 for IgG; x2 = 28.915, p = 0.001 for IgM).
Among the tested individuals, the seroprevalence of IgG was highest for those who voluntarily
came for serology test by themselves, followed by those encouraged by their work units,
including real estate property companies, urban construction companies, telecommunications
companies, banks, securities and insurance companies, law firms, and procuratorates.
CT Imaging and laboratory findings
The relationship between abnormal chest CT imaging and the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM
antibodies for different age groups is shown (Figure S3 and Figure S4). Of the participants,
1636 underwent chest CT, and 342 had abnormal images. CT imaging abnormality was 30.7%
(94/306) for people who were IgG antibody-positive compared to 19.7% (262/1330) for those
who were IgG negative. The difference was significant (x2 = 17.743, p < 0.001), as shown by
the odds ratio of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06–1.21). Among the IgG-positive patients, typical abnormal
chest CT signs were GGOs, GGOs with small mixed consolidation, and prominent peripheral
subpleural distribution. Significant differences were seen between IgG and/or IgM-positive
test groups in leucocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes and monocyte percentage (Table S4).
DISCUSSION
Detection of asymptomatic or subclinical novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections is
critical for understanding the overall prevalence and infection potential of COVID-19.[9]
There were some SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies of target people earlier this year from
blood donors or outpatient settings,[15-16] and from the general population of China,[10-12]
the USA,[13] Switzerland,[14] and Spain.[15] The Switzerland study showed seroprevalences
from 4.8% to 10.9% in different weeks in Geneva. The Spanish study showed a nationwide
seroprevalence of 5.0% (4.7–5.4%), with urban areas around Madrid exceeding 10%. All of

these studies demonstrate that most of the population appears to have remained unexposed to
SARS-CoV-2. Our study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence from SARS-CoV-2 infections
in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Despite being the earliest area
to be affected by COVID-19, the seroprevalence among the general population was only
3.35%. Our study indicates that most of the Wuhan population remains susceptible to COVID19. There were 50,333 reported confirmed patients up to April 28 in Wuhan, and we estimate
that for every reported confirmed case, there were at least 4.1 (204,548/50,333) asymptomatic
infections in the general population. This is smaller than the estimate of the Switzerland study,
which estimated 11.6 infections in the community for every reported confirmed case.
Our study showed there were differences in IgG seroprevalence among urban and rural
areas, which were much higher in Wuchang District and Jianghan District than in other areas.
Based on the cumulative number of reported cases of COVID-19 from March 25 to April 28,
and the number of residents in each district in Wuhan, we estimated an average incidence rate
per 100,000 people of 2.98% (95% CI: 2.97–2.99) during this period. Incidence rates were
higher in the Jianghan and Wuchang districts, at 8.09% (95% CI: 8.02–8.15) and 7.25% (95%
CI: 7.20–7.29) per 100,000 people, respectively, which show that seropositive rates in
different geographic areas were consistent with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in
Wuhan (Table S3 and Figure S5).
In our study, the highest seroprevalence of IgG was in those people who voluntarily
came for serology testing by themselves, most of whom had close contacts with COVID-19
patients and therefore had a higher risk of infection. Our study found significant aggregation of
asymptomatic infections in individuals from certain occupations. The groups in some
industries with high IgG seroprevalence were easy to identify due to the nature of their jobs,
such as insurance and securities professionals, professionals in the law industry, maintenance
personnel of urban construction company, and staff of rural commercial banks located in the

higher risk districts. It is known that some staff undertook substantial voluntary work in
response to government calls during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assist in, for instance,
administering in the local residential communities, transporting COVID-19 patients, and
screening the general population for epidemic incidence. Thus, they faced a greater chance of
contacting infected people during their work, and were more likely to be infected, even with
personal protection.
Some studies found an average level of IgG antibodies higher in females than in
males.[27] In our study, the IgG seroprevalence was also higher in females than in males,
indicating that females were more likely to have asymptomatic infections.
To our knowledge, the most common CT features in patients affected by COVID-19
include GGO and consolidation involving the bilateral lungs in a peripheral distribution.[28] In
our study, CT imaging demonstrated similar differences between IgG antibody-positive and
negative individuals, which is a reminder that some damage may have occurred in some
asymptomatic individuals positive for IgG antibodies.
This study had a few limitations. First, this study had selection bias since the analyzed
medical records were based on examinees directed by their work units. Most of the examinees
came from government-owned institutions and agencies instead of private businesses.
Therefore, the sample was incompletely randomized and insufficiently representative,
compromising the assessment accuracy of the prevalence of asymptomatic infections in
Wuhan. Second, as the examinees were only from the back-to-work population, people under
the age of 19 and over age 65 were too few to be fully covered in analyses.
This study has the important feature of having been designed as repeated five-day
serosurveys, which allowed for the monitoring of seroprevalence progression just after the end
of the first epidemic. Further, our study applied scientific statistical methods accounting for the
demographic structure of the general population and imperfect diagnostic tests to estimate

seroprevalence in the overall population, while capturing uncertainty in the estimates. Our
study will provide useful information for the investigation of herd immunity and help design
targeted strategies for prevention. Additionally, the study of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV2 among asymptomatic infections can provide scientific basis for vaccine development.
CONCLUSIONS
The seroprevalence of IgG and IgM in Wuhan indicates that reported confirmed patients only
represent a small proportion of the total number of infections, and most of the Wuhan
population remains susceptible to COVID-19. There were differences in IgG seroprevalence
among geographic areas, which were consistent with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus in Wuhan. Our study found significant aggregation of asymptomatic infections in
individual from certain occupations. The CT imaging and laboratory tests suggest that some
slight damage may have occurred in some asymptomatic individuals positive for IgG
antibodies.
