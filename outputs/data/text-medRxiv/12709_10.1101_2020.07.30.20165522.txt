Abstract
The kinetics of IgG avidity maturation during SARS-CoV-2 infection was studied. The
IgG avidity assay used a novel label-free immunoassay technology. It was found that there was a
strong correlation between IgG avidity and days since symptom onset, and peak readings were
significantly higher in severe than mild disease cases.

Main Text
In the race to identify correlates of COVID-19 immunity, the focus has been on
characterizing the production of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Most immunocompetent individuals
with symptomatic infections develop detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within 2 weeks of
symptom onset.1 The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response is more robust in severe cases of
COVID-19 at all time-points after seroconversion.1 Preliminary findings suggest that the
magnitude of the antibody response correlates with virus neutralizing power, but some
hypothesize that the antibodies could promote disease progression.2 Influential factors in the
distinction between protective antibodies and those that promote pathology include antibody
isotype, concentration, specificity, post-translational modifications, and avidity for the virus.
Most SARS-CoV-2 antibody studies to date have focused on the quantity of specific isotypes
rather than the quality of the antibodies. Antibody avidity, or functional affinity, is a measure of
the maturation of the humoral immune response after both infection and vaccination and
typically increases over time. For some viruses, the measurement of antibody avidity is used to
differentiate acute infection from past exposure or vaccination (e.g. toxoplasmosis, SARS-CoV
infection) and to detect re-infection in the presence of prolonged virus-shedding.3,4 Here we

report the development of a method to characterize SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity maturation in
COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis through convalescence.
The IgG avidity assay was established on a novel label-free immunoassay platform Gator
Analyzer (Gator Bio, Palo Alto, CA) to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity to the virus spike
protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). The platform utilizes thin-film interferometry and can
measure the entire time course of formation of an immune complex on a sensing probe without
attaching a reporter.5 The sensing probe in use was pre-coated with recombinant RBD (Histagged, Sino Biological, Wayne, PA). Serum samples were diluted 10-fold in running buffer
(PBS with 0.02% Tween 20, 0.2% BSA, and 0.05% NaN3) for analysis. The steps of the IgG
avidity assay included 1) dipping the sensing probe in running buffer for a baseline
measurement, 2) formation of RBD-IgG immune complex on the sensing probe, 3) dissociation
of loosely bound IgG using either running buffer or 3 M urea in running buffer, and 4) formation
of RBD-IgG-Anti-IgG immune complex using 10 μg/ml anti-IgG in running buffer (goat antihuman IgG antibody, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). The sensing probe was
washed in running buffer for 1 min between the steps, and regenerated in glycine pH 2.0. The
signal increase in the final step, which is proportional to the quantity of RBD-IgG-Anti-IgG
immune complex on the sensing probe, was measured. As other isotypes of antibodies might
bind to RBD in the second step, the measurement of the RBD-IgG-Anti-IgG immune complex
enhanced the assay specificity. The IgG avidity index was calculated as the ratio of the readout
with the dissociation agent (urea) to the reference (running buffer), presented as a percentage.
The performance of the IgG avidity assay was verified for precision and specificity. Precision
was evaluated using a spiked serum sample prepared by adding a standard anti-RBD IgG
(Absolute Antibody, Oxford, UK) in a negative serum sample. The spiked serum sample was

measured simultaneously by a row of 7 sensing probes, and the assay was repeated 4 times with
regeneration of the sensing probes. The CV among the sensing probes was 4.5%, and the CV
among regeneration cycles was 10.4%. The spiked serum sample was also measured in 4
consecutive days and the CV was 13.7%. Specificity was evaluated using a set of 28 serum
samples from individuals tested RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 and positive for other
respiratory viruses (4 coronavirus HKV1, 1 coronavirus 229E, 2 coronavirus OC43, 11 human
rhinovirus/enterovirus, 4 human metapneumovirus, 3 respiratory syncytial virus, 2 parainfluenza
type 1 virus, 1 adenovirus). No formation of RBD-IgG-Anti-IgG immune complex was observed
for these samples, providing negative results in the IgG avidity assay.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
California. All testing was performed on remnant serum samples collected for routine clinical
testing and stored at -20°C prior to testing. Individual and serial serum samples (n = 168) from
patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 90, 51% male, median age 49, 24% admitted to
the ICU) were analyzed. Based on least squares linear regression analysis, there was a strong
correlation between IgG avidity and days since symptom onset (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1A). SARSCoV-2 IgG avidity did not correlate with IgG concentration, as measured previously using a
quantitative immunoassay (1). The kinetics of IgG avidity maturation in 13 patients for whom
serial samples (≥ 3) were available is shown in Figure 1B. In all patients, IgG avidity increased
over time. Peak measurements, which included the last measurement per 7-day interval per
patient, were used to compare IgG avidity by disease severity. Peak readings were significantly
higher for specimens from ICU than non-ICU patients for the first month after symptom onset
(1-4 weeks) and thereafter, using the t-statistic (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1C).

To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate antibody avidity maturation in
COVID-19 patients. The findings confirm that IgG avidity significantly increases from 1-90 days
post-symptom onset and is significantly associated with disease severity. The findings are
consistent for what has been reported for SARS-CoV where avidity indices were low among
serum samples collected <50 days after symptom onset (30.8% + 11.6%), intermediate from 5190 days (52.1% + 14.1%), and high for samples collected after 90 days (78.1% + 8.0%).6 The
availability of samples after 90 days for SARS-CoV-2 in our cohort was limited at the time of
this analysis.
For other viruses, the existence of only low-quality and low-concentration antibodies can
enhance the infection (antibody-dependent enhancement) and inflammation (antibody-mediated
immune enhancement), while high-avidity antibodies capable of blocking receptor binding are
typically protective and promote virus neutralization.7 Given that SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG
avidity is strong in ICU patients after 1 month, these negative effects may not play a role in
COVID-19 disease progression and severity. A recent study suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 IgG
concentrations can wane over time, however, it is unclear if the antibodies that persist are of high
enough quality to neutralize the virus.8 Further studies are needed to determine if both the
antibody concentration and antibody avidity correlate with virus neutralization and persist over
time. The avidity method described here makes use of the label-free immunoassay technology,
thin-film interferometry, which allows for direct observation of the time course of immune
complex formation. This technology could be a valuable tool for continued characterization of
the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
