Abstract:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory

26

syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in early 2020. Lateral flow

27

immunoassays for antibody testing have been viewed as a cheap and rapidly deployable

28

method for determining previous infection with SARS-CoV-2; however, these assays have

29

shown unacceptably low sensitivity. We report on nine lateral flow immunoassays currently

30

available and compare their titer sensitivity in serum to a best-practice enzyme-linked

31

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization assay. For a small group of PCR-

32

positive, we found two lateral flow immunoassay devices with titer sensitivity roughly equal to

33

the ELISA; these devices were positive for all PCR-positive patients harboring SARS-CoV-2

34

neutralizing antibodies. One of these devices was deployed in Northern Italy to test its sensitivity

35

and specificity in a real-world clinical setting. Using the device with fingerstick blood on a cohort

36

of 27 hospitalized PCR-positive patients and seven hospitalized controls, ROC curve analysis

gave AUC values of 0.7646 for IgG. For comparison, this assay was also tested with saliva from

38

the same patient population and showed reduced discrimination between cases and controls

39

with AUC values of 0.6841 for IgG. Furthermore, during viral neutralization testing, one patient

40

was discovered to harbor autoantibodies to ACE2, with implications for how immune responses

41

are profiled. We show here through a proof-of-concept study that these lateral flow devices can

42

be as analytically sensitive as ELISAs and adopted into hospital protocols; however, additional

improvements to these devices remain necessary before their clinical deployment.

Introduction
In March of 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) joined the ranks of

46

other infectious diseases such as influenza and plague to be categorized as a pandemic. As of

47

July 13, 2020, roughly 13 million people worldwide have been confirmed to have contracted

48

COVID-19, leading to over 500,000 fatalities so far (1). While vaccine and therapeutic

49

interventions are under investigation by almost every qualified scientific body worldwide, there

50

remain significant challenges associated with reducing spread prior to effective therapeutic

51

strategies. One hurdle to reducing spread of the disease is the difficulty in the identification of

52

both actively infected individuals as well as those who have recovered. Active infections,

53

typically diagnosed by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),

54

have been plagued with false negative issues as well as availability issues in some countries,

55

including the United States (2–4). Time since infection has proven to be an important source of

56

variability in real time RT-PCR results due to difficulties in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in

57

patients prior to development of symptoms, or more than 5 days post-development of symptoms

58

(5).

59

Rather than using real time RT-PCR to constantly test for active cases, serologic

60

antibody testing has been proposed as an important tool to determine the prevalence and

61

spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a community. Positivity rates for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2

62

IgG or IgM in patient serum have been shown to rise above 90% after an average of 11-13 days

63

from symptom onset, though seroconversion timeframes for IgG as it relates to IgM are not

64

necessarily comparable between patients (6). Because antibody testing can be quite variable,

65

there have been concerted efforts to standardize testing. A best-practice ELISA protocol from

66

the Krammer group at Mt. Sinai has been given EUA approval from the FDA, and reagents from

67

this lab have been widely distributed through BEI Resources (7, 8). Additionally, the National

68

Institutes of Health (NIH) has released a broadly similar optimized ELISA protocol that is being

69

adopted for serostudies conducted through the NIH (9). Other groups have reported using

70

similar ELISA protocols with the recombinant HEK293-produced spike receptor binding domain

71

(RBD) protein as the antigen for detection (10). Despite the complications of inter-patient

72

variability and assay timing, ELISA antibody tests have been able to successfully detect robust

73

IgG responses in the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals regardless of clinical

74

severity (6, 7, 11–14). For this reason, serology testing remains a promising lead for

75

understanding the incidence and spread of COVID-19, difficulties notwithstanding.

76

One approach to overcoming some of the challenges associated with serologic antibody

77

testing is the introduction of lateral flow immunoassays (LFIs): cheap devices that can be rapidly

78

produced and given/interpreted by medical professionals without the need for a laboratory (15).

79

Because of the low cost and high availability, LFIs have the potential to be widely deployed.

80

There have been several studies comparing different commercially-available LFI tests to a best-

81

practice ELISA to determine appropriate candidates for more widespread deployment; one

82

commonly encountered problem is unacceptably low sensitivity (16–18). A recent systematic

83

review and meta-analysis of 40 such studies found that LFIs for COVID-19 had a pooled

84

sensitivity of only 66%, well behind pooled ELISA sensitivity at 84% (19). Moreover, most

85

studies included in the review analyzed LFIs in the laboratory, instead of at the point-of-care

86

(19).

87

A reason for the overall reduced sensitivity of LFIs versus ELISA assays could be

88

reduced analytical sensitivity of LFIs (20, 21). There are currently no studies directly comparing

89

the analytical sensitivity of multiple LFIs against a best-practice ELISA. Therefore, we proposed

90

to answer two questions: first, are any currently available LFIs as analytically sensitive as an

91

ELISA? Second, if a suitably sensitive test can be identified, is it sufficiently simple to use and to

92

interpret such that it could be deployed clinically? To answer these questions, we report herein

93

on the evaluation of the analytical sensitivity of nine commercially available LFI devices,

94

including two currently under FDA EUA approval, as compared to a best-practice ELISA.

95

Furthermore, we conducted a pilot-scale study of the clinical utility of the most analytically

105

suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on symptoms, contacts, or travel history. A total of

106

seven PCR-positive or clinically-diagnosed patients donated serum samples that were used in

107

this study; four patients donated samples at two different time points. On the day of donation,

108

each patient was consented and donated at least two tubes of blood, one collected in a gel

109

serum separator tube (SST, gold top 5 mL, BD Vacutainer cat# 368013) and one collected in a

110

clot-activator serum tube (RT, red top 5 mL, BD Vacutainer cat# 367814). Blood was allowed to

111

clot for 45-60 minutes at room temperature, and serum was separated via centrifugation (2250 x

112

124

To correct for intra-plate differences, four calibrator samples consisting of three pre-diluted

125

positive control sera and a negative control were added to every plate. Samples were

126

normalized to the geometric mean of the calibrator values. A total of 12 negative serum samples

127

were used to determine assay background; samples were collected prior to 2019 as healthy

128

controls for an unrelated breast cancer study. Average of the negative samples plus three

129

standard deviations at each dilution was used as the background value. Samples were

130

considered above background if the mean value minus average standard deviation for the

131

sample was greater than the background value at a given serum dilution; differences less than

132

0.05 abs units were considered insignificant.

151

sample deposition, 2-3 drops of buffer included in each kit were added to the sample pad to

152

start the flow of the sample up the lateral flow strip. Results were scored between 10-20 minutes

153

following sample deposition for every test by three independent scorers using a 3-point scale.

154

Absence of a line, or a negative result, was scored as 0; clear presence of a line, or a positive

155

result, was scored as a 2; and a faint line that neared the limit of detection for the scorer or was

156

difficult to see was scored as a 1. All scores were averaged, and the score for a given test was

157

considered positive if the average of the three scores was greater than 1. Titers were

158

determined for each test as the highest dilution of serum that scored greater than 1 for a given

159

patient. Agreement between readers for LFI data was determined via Fleiss’ kappa statistic,

160

Krippendorff’s alpha statistic, and percent agreement as calculated by STATA 13 (StataCorp.

161

2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP) for three

162

readers with three variable assignments. For Fleiss’ kappa, 0.4 < κ < 0.75 indicated mild to

of 2% crystal violet and 20% ethanol to visualize plaques. Percent neutralization was calculated

178

as: [(number of SARS-CoV-2 plaques per well without anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum) – (number of

179

SARS-CoV-2 plaques per well of diluted anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum) / (number of SARS-CoV-2

180

181

the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that neutralized 90% of SARS-CoV-2. Samples

Western Blot Analysis
Serum samples from patients 1F, 8F, 10F, and an uninfected negative control individual were

186

examined for the presence of anti-ACE2 or anti-S antibodies. All samples for this analysis were

187

provided from the first donations of each patient collected in gel serum separator tubes (SST).

188

Whole cell extracts from A549 and Vero E6 were analyzed via BCA assay per the

189

manufacturer’s recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For western blot, equal amounts

190

of protein were mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and NuPAGE sample reducing agent,

191

heated at 70°C, and separated on a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris protein gel (Thermo Fisher

203

patients who had been in the hospital greater than 10 days (n = 27) were consented under IRB

204

compliance. Each patient provided a saliva sample by depositing the sample in a

205

microcentrifuge tube. Saliva samples were centrifuged to separate cellular/food debris from the

206

supernatant. Saliva supernatant was aspirated into the kit-provided plastic droppers to the fill

207

point recommended by the LFI manufacturer and deposited on the absorbent sample pad of the

208

LFI test. Fingerstick blood samples were obtained by piercing the skin with a sterile lancet, and

209

a single drop of blood was expressed and spotted onto the absorbent sample pad of the LFI

210

test. Following deposition of either the saliva or the fingerstick blood sample, 2-3 drops of

211

included sample buffer was added directly to the sample pad to start the flow of sample up the

212

lateral flow strip. Test strips were read at 20 minutes post sample deposition and were scored

213

upon visual inspection by with agreement from at least two nurses. Seven PCR-negative

214

hospitalized patients provided saliva and blood samples as the negative controls. To determine

215

sensitivity and specificity of LFI tests in the healthcare setting for saliva and fingerstick blood,

216

receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were generated with GraphPad Prism version

217

8.4.3. Two by two tables used to determine positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive

218

value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity were generated using Microsoft Excel.

Results

224

patients with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis (7F and 19F), donated serum towards our analytical

225

sensitivity study comparing a best-practice ELISA assay versus nine commercially available LFI

226

devices. While Patient 7F and Patient 19F were both clinically diagnosed based on symptoms,

227

Patient 19F additionally shared a household with a RT-PCR positive patient 20M. Patients 1F,

228

7F, 19F, and 20F provided two samples for a total of 11 unique samples for analysis. Table 1

229

reports the clinical details for each included patient. The first serum donations collected from the

230

first six donors (1F, 7F, 8F, 10F, 19F, 20M) were used to screen all nine lateral flow devices;

231

devices that performed well were brought forward to a secondary screen, which included the

232

remaining five serum samples. We adopted a similar ELISA protocol to that of the Krammer

233

group and the NIH (8, 9) with minimal modifications. Primarily, we conducted a single-tiered

234

screening protocol using the spike receptor binding domain (RBD, Sino Biological) rather than a

235

two-tiered screening protocol using first the RBD, then the full-length spike (S) protein. It has

236

been shown that convalescent patients possessing S-reactive antibodies also possess RBD-

237

reactive antibodies (7).

A total of five RT-PCR positive patients (1F, 8F, 10F, 20M, and 27F), as well as two

238

As shown in Figure 1, five of the six patients were determined to have anti-SARS-CoV-2

239

RBD-reactive IgG antibodies at levels above assay background (dotted line in Figure 1) via

240

ELISA. Patient 7F did not have detectable antibodies above background via ELISA at any

241

dilution, and thus could not be included in the analytical sensitivity analysis. ELISA titers

242

detected in patients 1F, 8F, 10F, 19F, and 20M range between 1:200 to 1:20,000 dilution of

243

serum. The lowest dilution of serum which was positive above background via ELISA provided

244

the “benchmark” for the titers for a patient; this benchmark is noted with a gold line in Figure 1.

245

LFIs were then evaluated for their analytical sensitivity and compared to this ELISA benchmark.

246

For most patients, an IgG LFI device from RayBiotech (Figure 1, in blue) proved the

247

most sensitive of the LFIs tested, hitting the ELISA benchmark shown in gold for two of the five

248

tested patients in the first screen. Additionally, patients 1F (Figure 1A), 10F (Figure 1C), and

249

19F (Figure 1D) showed values in the ELISA above background only by a very small margin,

250

suggesting that even in patients 8F and 19F, the RayBiotech device was very sensitive. An LFI

251

device from EDiagnostics (Figure 1, in orange) also performed well, with titers equaling that of

252

the ELISA in one of the five patients. Each LFI was tested with dilutions of serum ranging from

253

1:2 to 1:20,000 as well as undiluted serum. Device scoring was conducted using a 3-point scale

254

in which 0 represented a negative result (absence of a test line), 2 represented a positive result

255

(presence of a test line), and 1 represented an indeterminate result (line at the reader’s visual

256

limit of detection). Three readers independently scored each kit, and the average of the three

257

scores was used to report LFI results (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). Raw data is

258

reported in Supplementary Table 1. For a particular serum dilution to be considered positive via

259

LFI, the average score from all three readers for that test had to be greater than 1. Because the

260

LFI titer sensitivity is the average of three scores, it should be kept in mind that the titer

261

sensitivity value reported does have intrinsic error, the quantification of which is further

262

discussed in Table 2.

263

IgG responses have been reported to be more reliable via lateral flow than IgM

264

responses. This is attributed to the low affinity of IgM antibodies and the narrow window in

265

which IgM antibody concentrations are high (24). While all IgG LFIs were positive with undiluted

266

serum for all patients, there was a marked reduction in agreement between LFI devices for the

267

presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies, even with undiluted serum. As shown in Table

268

S1, some devices showed higher scores at lower dilutions (i.e. 1:20 versus undiluted),

269

complicating analytical sensitivity analysis. The strict time dependence for detection of IgM

271

SARS-CoV-2 infection (16) led us to focus on IgG results as the more clinically relevant

272

antibody isotype, with IgM results presented in the supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1.

273

Based on the results of the first screen, a secondary screen with the remaining five

274

samples was conducted with the highest sensitivity LFIs, EDiagnostics and RayBiotech, along

275

with a representative from the lower sensitivity LFI group, SafeCare, which reports using the

276

same antigen as the RayBiotech test. For the secondary screen, one new patient was tested

277

(27F), as well as repeat donations from 1F, 7F, 19F, and 20M, marked as “D2” for second

278

donation. As shown in Figure 2, the EDiagnostics and RayBiotech test kits were again found to

279

be more analytically sensitive than the SafeCare test. Patient 7F again tested negative via all

280

LFIs and ELISA. For LFI+ patients who donated two samples (1F, 19F, 20M), no significant

281

difference in titer level was detected between donation dates, which were three weeks apart for

282

these three patients. The EDiagnostics test was as analytically sensitive as the ELISA in three

283

patients’ samples (1F:D2, 20M:D2, and 27F), while the RayBiotech test was as analytically

284

sensitive as the ELISA in one patient’s samples (1F:D2).

285

Only four of the nine manufacturers have directly reported the antigens used as bait for

286

the patient IgG and IgM. Both SafeCare and RayBiotech report using solely the N protein,

287

Healgen reports using the S protein, and Cellex reports using both N and S. This is of particular

288

interest as the RayBiotech test showed roughly equivalent titer sensitivity to the in-house ELISA,

289

despite using a different antigen (N vs S RBD). Previous reports comparing SARS-CoV-2

290

antibody ELISAs utilizing S RBD protein versus N protein have shown increased sensitivity and

291

specificity when using the S protein (10).

292

When comparing the nine tests, it becomes clear that there can be a trade-off between

293

sensitivity and line intensity. Table 2 reports the Fleiss’ kappa, Krippendorff’s alpha, and percent

294

agreement values for each test, including combined results for both IgG and IgM for all LFIs

295

tested in the first and second screens (IgG and IgM values are reported separately in Table S2

296

and S3). These metrics describe the relative agreement in scores given by each of the three

297

readers. Focusing on the kappa value as an example, all tests kits had kappa values greater

298

than 0.4, outside of the RayBiotech test which scored a 0.399, which indicates mild to moderate

299

agreement. Three tests had kappa values greater than 0.75, indicated strong agreement as

300

recommended by (22). While test kits from RayBiotech and EDiagnostics were the most

301

sensitive kits tested (Figure 1), they also displayed the lowest Fleiss’ kappa values (Table 2).

302

Conversely, the test kit with the lowest sensitivity, available from LumiQuick, displayed the

303

highest Fleiss’ kappa value. We can report qualitatively that those test kits with higher Fleiss

304

kappa scores, such as LumiQuick, Pinnacle, and AcroBiotech, had test lines that were more

305

intense and more easily distinguished from background over kits with higher kappa values,

306

leading to improved agreement in scoring. We propose that while the RayBiotech and

307

EDiagnostics kits were the most analytically sensitive, much of that sensitivity is garnered by

308

weak positive results at high dilution, which were inconsistently scored between readers. It is

309

worth considering that while sensitivity has been reported as a key weakness of lateral flow

310

immunoassay devices, simple increases in sensitivity may not directly translate to clinical

311

performance due to issues in consistent scoring between readers.

324

anti-N antibodies within ELISA or LFI detection limits, we sought additional information by

325

utilizing plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). All other patients were included in the

326

analysis for comparison.

327

As shown in Figure 3A, all patients with detectable antibodies via ELISA and LFI

328

demonstrated viral neutralization at levels considered suitable for convalescent plasma donation

329

(PRNT90 > 160) in both gel serum separator tubes (SST) and clot activator serum tubes (RT)

330

(23). Patient 7F however had no neutralizing antibodies detected in either sample. Given this

331

patient’s clinical diagnosis based on distinctive symptoms (loss of taste and smell), we decided

332

to probe 7F’s sample for presence for additional factors that indicates infection. There have

333

been reports that some viral neutralization assays conducted with serum from patients in the

334

context of SARS showed interference due to autoantibodies (26), but there have not been

335

reports of this phenomenon yet with SARS-CoV-2 patients. Given this possibility, we conducted

336

Western blot analysis with the serum of patient 7F compared to PCR-positive 1F, 8F, and 10F

337

to determine if patient 7F could be making autoantibodies against receptors for SARS-CoV-2,

338

which could be protective but may not be neutralizing based on the conditions of the PRNT

339

assay. We specifically considered angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the most well-

340

known receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (27). As shown in Figure 3B, patient 7F’s serum reacted

341

strongly with the ACE2+ cellular lysates, with significantly higher intensity observed for ACE2

342

bands with this patient than any other patient examined. Patient 1F and 8F had lower reactivity

343

to ACE2, while 10F had no detectable reactivity to ACE2. A negative patient without SARS-

344

COV-2 infection also showed no reactivity to ACE2. Conversely, patients 1F and 8F showed

345

anti-S antibodies, confirming the ELISA results from Figure 1, while patient 7F was again

346

negative for S antibodies, as shown in Figure 3C. Interestingly, patient 10F did not have

347

detectable anti-S antibodies in this assay. Based on this data, where known positive patients

348

mounted limited anti-ACE2 antibodies (1F and 8F), we conclude that some patients may

349

produce anti-host antibodies as well to protect against disease. It is possible this was the

350

primary response for patient 7F, explaining why other measures of response were negative. We

351

conclude that if patient 7F was truly infected likely with SARS-CoV-2, as distinctive symptoms

352

would suggest, they did not mount significant antibody response against the virus itself that we

353

could detect, but potentially produced some anti-host antibodies instead. These anti-host

354

antibodies did not appear neutralizing in this assay. Because of the uncertainty of infection in

355

patients who did not receive a positive RT-PCR test but only a clinical diagnosis, we did not

356

include any clinically diagnosed patients as potential positive cases for COVID-19 disease for

357

our point-of-care analysis.

358
359
360

Highly sensitive lateral flow immunoassay devices used at the point-of-care can distinguish
cases from controls but require additional improvements before widespread clinical deployment
Analytical sensitivity of the RayBiotech and EDiagnostics LFI tests were shown to be

361

similar to that of the best-practice ELISA in a total of six patients. To determine if this sensitivity

362

could translate to clinical utility, we tested the RayBiotech LFI devices on 27 PCR-confirmed,

363

hospitalized patients in Trento, Italy.

364

confirmed patients were considered as true positive cases for this clinical study. Each patient

365

was tested with three lateral flow devices: RayBiotech’s IgG test kit, RayBiotech IgM test kit,

366

and SafeCare’s IgG/IgM test kit as a comparison to a less sensitive test. RayBiotech and

367

SafeCare’s tests both use the N protein for detection, allowing for direct comparison between

368

the two LFI devices. Each patient was tested using fingerstick blood, which both manufacturers

369

recommend, as well as saliva, which is expected to be lower sensitivity and which no

370

manufacturer recommended. As shown in Figure 4B, the IgG LFI from RayBiotech was

371

successfully used in the clinic and could distinguish between cases (N=27) and controls (N=7)

372

better than chance using fingerstick blood. All 2 by 2 tables are reported in Supplementary

373

Figure 2. As expected, saliva was a poorer discriminator between cases and controls than was

374

fingerstick blood using the RayBiotech test; however, it was a better discriminator using the

375

SafeCare test. This improved AUC value in saliva was driven by the 100% specificity,

376

determined by no false positive detection in the small sample (N=7) of negative saliva. Thus, it

377

remains to be seen if this test could be used in saliva clinically. The corresponding sensitivity

378

was particularly poor (48%). Larger studies of saliva will be needed to determine if this biofluid is

379

a promising source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for serostudy detection. Based on this pilot

380

scale point-of-care study, the RayBiotech test was superior to the SafeCare test in the accuracy

381

of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection using fingerstick blood.

382
383

Discussion
We set out to answer two primary questions in our investigation: first, are there LFI tests

384

that are as analytically sensitive as the best practice ELISA? Secondly, if such a test were to be

385

found, could it show improved point-of-care performance over other reported LFI tests? To

386

answer the first question, we first examined a group of patients (N=7) from the community that

387

were either PCR-positive or clinically diagnosed to investigate the analytical sensitivity of nine

388

different LFI devices, including two devices with FDA EUA approval (Cellex and Healgen), using

389

an ELISA assay as a comparator. To our knowledge, no one has reported a screen of the

390

analytical sensitivity of multiple LFI devices, and several of the LFI devices in our selection,

391

including both the RayBiotech and EDiagnostics LFIs, have not been reported in other

392

publications. We found that the two most analytically sensitive LFIs for this cohort, from

393

RayBiotech and EDiagnostics, showed similar analytical sensitivity to the ELISA. This potentially

394

justifies their use in the clinic, which until now has reported poor sensitivity with LFI devices.

395

Based on the analytical sensitivity analysis, it may be useful to consider the role these

396

tests could have in screening convalescent plasma for donation. In this scenario, specificity

397

concerns are minimized by only testing PCR-positive patients, while sensitivity concerns are

398

amplified as one wants to identify all potential convalescent plasma donors. Our small patient

399

group utilized in the analytical sensitivity study consisted of exclusively non-hospitalized

400

patients. It may be worth considering using these lateral flow devices as additional tools for

401

identifying potential convalescent plasma donors, as this is much less time intensive and

402

expensive than performing viral neutralization assays on potential donors instead.

403

To evaluate how much increased sensitivity could improve the accuracy of LFI tests at

404

the point-of-care, we performed a pilot-scale clinical evaluation of the sensitive RayBiotech test

405

against the less sensitive SafeCare test. Both tests report using the N protein as the capture

406

antigen; this ensures an appropriate comparison between the tests. We found that when

407

examining fingerstick blood, the RayBiotech test was more sensitive than the SafeCare test, as

408

hypothesized based on the sensitivity observed in our analytical sensitivity evaluation, but not

409

by as great a margin as expected (81% versus 78%, respectively, Figure S2). Instead, the

410

difference in AUC values was driven more by the increased specificity of the RayBiotech test

411

(71% versus 57%, respectively). Furthermore, it is unclear how significantly the results of such a

412

screen may be complicated by irreproducible scoring; we found that both the EDiagnostics test

413

and the RayBiotech test showed only mild correlation when scored by multiple independent

414

readers in the laboratory. Going forward, the correct balance between sensitivity and consistent

415

readability will be critical for useful clinical adoption.

416

Both tests, when used on patient saliva, showed reductions in sensitivity as compared to

417

fingerstick blood, as would be expected. While the SafeCare test showed an improved AUC with

418

saliva over fingerstick blood, this was driven by the 100% specificity value on a very small

419

cohort of negative patients (N=7), and it is unclear if saliva would be a suitable biofluid for

420

analysis with this LFI. Larger trials are ongoing to determine if saliva, either raw or processed to

421

concentrate antibodies, can be substituted for serum when using lateral flow devices. Given the

422

noted sensitivity problems even with serum for lateral flow devices, and the fact that saliva

423

contains a greatly reduced concentration of antibodies as compared to serum (28), it is likely

424

that some additional processing steps will be required. There have been reports on the use of

425

saliva for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (29); to our knowledge, there have not yet

426

been any reports adapting saliva for use in the context of LFI devices for antibody detection.

427

This could represent a large improvement in patient acceptability and ease-of-use for

428

serostudies, however, as we show in our point-of-care analysis, saliva remains unsuitable for

429

this use without further improvements in methodology or devices.

430

In a surprising turn, during the process of evaluating the viral neutralization potential of

431

patient serum in the analytical sensitivity portion of the study, we did find a noteworthy presence

432

of anti-ACE2 autoantibodies in the serum of patient 7F, as well as limited anti-ACE2 antibodies

433

in patient 1F and 8F’s samples as well. Patient 7F, with the highest concentration of anti-ACE2

434

antibodies, reported having hypothyroidism, an autoimmune condition. We speculate that

435

autoimmune conditions, such as hypothyroidism, may occur in patients with “overactive”

436

immune systems that are subsequently more likely to harbor autoantibodies such as those

437

detected against ACE2 over other healthy patients such as 1F and 8F. Further research is

438

needed to determine if hypothyroidism, or other autoimmune conditions, could impact the

439

antibody repertoire produced by the host in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore,

440

our rationale for testing against cellular proteins such as ACE2 was that there were either low to

441

no antibodies against S antigen and that viral infections usually cause either partial cell damage

442

or complete cell death (i.e., apoptosis, pyroptosis, etc), where cellular antigens that are normally

443

hidden/protected from the immune system would now become a source of viable antigens for

444

the immune system to recognize (i.e., autoantigens). This is also in line with recognition of the

445

conserved molecular structures expressed by invading microbes named pathogen-associated

446

molecular patterns (PAMPs), and the

447

leads to tissue damage generating endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)

448

including stress signals such as damaged or apoptotic cells recognized by PRRs (30).

449

Although these signals promote cellular immunity in acute settings (i.e., NLR, RLR, and TLRs),

450

we believe that they could also pose as potential source of antigens in chronic cases of

451

diseases such as COVID-19, where survivors are battling long-term effects (~20% of all

452

patients). In this case, there are many reports of prolonged symptoms, from chest pain and

453

gastrointestinal issues to cognitive problems and debilitating fatigue that resemble autoantibody

uncontrolled inflammation in chronic diseases which

454

related pathologies including Kawasaki disease (KD), the leading cause of acquired heart

455

disease in children; rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory diseases; and a host of other pathologies

456

including encephalitic syndrome and anosmia (31–34). Future experiments will better define the

457

role of cellular DAMPs (including other receptor/co-receptors such as TMPRSS2, Cathapsin L,

458

CD147, and Neuropilin-1) in COVID-19 infections and whether a robust and aggressive immune

459

response present in these patients is against the pathogen only, or a mixture of DAMPs (i.e.,

460

ACE2 antibodies that also block viral entry into cells) that promote immunogenicity and efficacy

461

by enhancing innate and cellular immune responses.

462

In summary, the poor sensitivity of LFIs in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antibody

463

diagnostics has been documented. Here we demonstrate that this is a resolvable challenge, as

464

several manufacturers have produced very analytically sensitive tests. However, the transition

465

from the laboratory to the clinic reveals additional problems in specificity and ease of use that

466

mandate addressing. Furthermore, as others have reported, not all patients make significant

467

anti-S or anti-N antibodies (35), but may have alternative immune responses to SARS-CoV-2

468

that are protective. When using antibody tests, one must consider how may truly infected

469

patients could be missed in the analysis due to alternative immune responses, and one may

470

want to consider a suite of multiple viral and host proteins to truly understand a patient’s

471

antibody response. We look forward to additional improvements in these antibody tests to allow

472

them to meet the diagnostic needs of the present moment.

Figure 1. Titer sensitivity of nine LFIs compared to a best practice ELISA reveals two
devices with high analytical sensitivity. Negative control samples (N = 12) were used to
determine ELISA assay background. A) Patient 1F showed titers down to 1:20,000 above
background via ELISA. EDiagnostics LFI and RayBiotech LFI were the most sensitive for this
patient, showing positive scores to 1:2000. B) Patient 8F showed titers down to 1:200 above
background via ELISA and RayBiotech LFI. C) Patient 10F showed titers down to 1:2000 above
background via ELISA. RayBiotech LFI was the most sensitive for this patient, showing positive
scores to 1:200. D) Patient 19F showed titers down to 1:2000 above background via ELISA.
RayBiotech LFI was the most sensitive for this patient, showing positive scores down to 1:200.
E) Patient 20F showed titers down to 1:2000 above background via ELISA, EDiagnostics LFI,
and RayBiotech LFI. F) Patient 7F was negative at all dilutions. G) Legend utilized for panels AF.

Figure 2: Comparing titer sensitivity of three LFIs, two high performing in the primary
screen and one average-performing in the primary screen, reveals continued high
analytical sensitivity of LFIs from EDiagnostics and RayBiotech. Negative control samples
(N = 12) were used to determine ELISA assay background as in Figure 1. No significant
difference in titers between first and second patient’s donations was observed. A) Patient 1F,
second donation sample, showed titers down to 1:2000 above background via ELISA,
EDiagnostics LFI, and RayBiotech LFI. B) Patient 19F, second donation sample, showed titers
down to 1:200 above background via ELISA and RayBiotech LFI. C) Patient 20M, second
donation sample, showed titers down to 1:2000 above background via ELISA and EDiagnostics
LFI. D) Patient 27F showed titers down to 1:2000 above background via ELISA and
EDiagnostics LFI. E) Patient 7F, second donation sample, was negative at all dilutions. F)

Figure 3. Viral neutralization, ELISA, and LFI negative patients may still harbor antireceptor antibodies that could affect clinical disease. A) PRNT90 values of PCR-confirmed
or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients shows high neutralizing titers only for patients who
also harbor anti-S or anti-N antibodies as determined via ELISA or LFI. Patient 7F did not inhibit
the virus. Both gel serum separator tubes (SST) and clot activator serum tubes (RT) showed
broadly similar titers for most patients. B) Patient 7F’s first donation serum sample reacts
strongly with ACE2+ lysates, above both other infected and uninfected patients, suggesting the
presence of significant autoantibodies against ACE2. C) Patients 1F and 8F’s first donation
samples show reactivity against the S protein from infected Vero cells, while 7F and the
uninfected control do not. While 10F’s first donation sample showed anti-S responses via
ELISA, 10F does not show anti-S antibodies in this assay.

Figure 4. PCR-positive COVID-19 patients tested in the hospital at the point-of-care were
correctly identified as positive more often by the RayBiotech test kit than by the
SafeCare test kit using fingerstick blood. A) Schematic of trial design. N=27 hospitalized
COVID-19 patients greater than 10 days after start of symptoms were consented and donated a
fingerstick blood sample and an oral fluid sample. Each patient’s sample was tested against
both the RayBiotech IgG and IgM test kits, and the SafeCare IgG/IgM test kit. B) RayBiotech
correctly distinguished cases from controls (N=7 hospitalized, negative patients) with an AUC
value of 0.7646 for fingerstick blood. Fingerstick blood was superior to saliva as hypothesized.
C) SafeCare correctly distinguished cases from controls with an AUC of 0.6746 for fingerstick
blood. Saliva was surprisingly superior to fingerstick blood, driven largely by the 100%
specificity value. Sensitivity with saliva was poor (48%).
