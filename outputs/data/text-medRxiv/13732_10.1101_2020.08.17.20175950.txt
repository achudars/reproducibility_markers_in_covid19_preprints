Abstract

30

Monitoring the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies such as IgG, M and A in COVID-19 patient is

31

an alternative method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and an simple way to monitor immune

32

responses in convalescent patients and after vaccination. Here, we assessed the levels of

33

SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific antibodies in twenty-seven COVID-19 convalescent patients over 28-99

34

days after hospital discharge. Almost all patient who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and

35

a high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit. The remaining

36

patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit. As expected, IgM levels in

37

almost all convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit. The RBD-specific IgA

38

levels were also reduced significantly at revisit. We also attempted to estimate decline rates of

39

virus-specific antibodies using a previously established exponential decay model of antibody kinetics

40

after infection. The predicted days when convalescent patients’ RBD-specific IgG reaches to an

41

undetectable level are approximately 273 days after hospital discharge, while the predicted decay

42

times are 150 days and 108 days for IgM and IgA, respectively. This investigation and report will aid

43

current and future studies to develope SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are potent and long-lasting.

Introduction

46

The 2019 novel coronavirus (later renamed as SARS-CoV-2 in February 2020) infected over 12 million

47

people globally by early July and caused mild to severe COVID-19 patients in millions.

48

levels of antibodies such as immunoglobin (Ig) G, M and A that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 and

49

present in blood provides not only an alternative method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection

50

(including asymptomatic carriers), but also an simple way to monitor immune responses in

51

convalescent patients or after vaccination.

52

antibodies, especially those that can bind to and neutralize the virus, would be a strong indication that

53

an immunized host could resist to SRAS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, there are no effective drugs to

54

specifically prevent or cure SARS-CoV-2 infection; therefore, host immune responses and

55

antibody-based therapeutics will continue playing important roles in combating and later preventing

56

COVID-19.

Monitoring the

A high and persistent level of SARS-CoV-2 specific

57
58

We previously established a set of diagnostic kits that quantitatively and sensitively measure the levels

59

of serum IgG, IgM and IgA specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD),

60

based on a cohort of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 483 negative controls (Ma et al., 2020).

61

These antibodies specifically bind to the RBD may block its interaction with a cell-surface protein ACE2

62

that serves as a main viral receptor.

63

specifically binds to the RBD highly correlates with that of neutralizing antibody activity in blocking

64

infection of SARS-CoV-2 or a pseudo-virus (Ni et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Our

65

RBD-specific, chemiluminescence-based kits are highly quantitative and sensitive for detecting

66

SARS-CoV-2 elicited IgA, IgG and IgM in blood (Ma et al., 2020). During the optimal detection

67

window of 16-25 days post illness onset, levels of RBD-specific IgA and IgG, but not IgM, were

68

significantly higher in severe and moderate than mild COVID-19 patients (Ma et al., 2020).

Results and Discussions

Previous studies demonstrated that the serum level of IgG that

71

To assess the levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent patients over time

72

after hospital discharge, we used the same kits for detecting RBD-specific IgG, IgM and IgA levels in

73

blood of patients in this cohort as we did for them during the hospitalization(Ma et al., 2020).

Thirty-three convalescent patients living in Anhui Province of China voluntarily came back to our clinic

convalescent patients is listed in Supplemental table 1 in the order of COVID-19 severity during

78

hospitalization. The table includes clinical information, discharge and revisit dates, and interval (28-99

79

days with a median 91 days) for each patient. The levels of the RBD-specific serum IgG, IgM and IgA

80

(measured as relative light unit or RLU after 40-times dilution) shortly before discharge and at revisit

81

are tabulated at Supplemental Table 2. In Figure 1 (A-C), we plotted antibody levels soon before

82

discharge and at revisit as Cutoff Index (COI), which is the ratio of RLU Signal / Cutoff value

83

determined previously for serum IgG, IgM and IgA, respectively(Ma et al., 2020).

84

convalescent patients, all (except #10) who had severe or moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a

85

high-level of IgG during the hospitalization showed a significant reduction at revisit (A).

86

remaining patients who had a low-level IgG during hospitalization stayed low at revisit.

87

IgM levels in these convalescent patients reduced significantly or stayed low at revisit, except #14 (B).

88

The RBD-specific IgA levels were also reduced significantly at revisit (C), except patient #10 who also

89

had an increased IgG, but not IgM. Few exceptional cases will need further studies.

In summary, the initial data of this longitudinal study showed that the levels of SARS-CoV-2

100

RBD-specific antibodies in most COVID-19 convalescent patients reduced significantly or remained

101

low within the first 100 days after discharge.

102

the virus-specific IgG in this group of convalescent patients will disappear in 273 days (~ 9 months).

103

Our data and analyses provide timely and critical information on how long acquired humoral immune

104

responses to this new human coronavirus could persist.

105

the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 elicited antibodies after recovery beyond two weeks(Long et al.,

106

2020; Ni et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). In one study, blood samples (both cells

107

and plasma) of six convalescent patients were collected two weeks after discharge and used to

108

examine humoral and cellular immune responses(Ni et al., 2020). In another study (Wu et al., 2020),

109

the serum IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and virus-neutralizing antibodies remained similarly

110

low in 47 recovered patients two weeks after discharge.

111

declines of RBD-specific IgG and virus-neutralizing activities in 148 convalescent patients after an

112

average of 39 days (Robbiani et al, 2020). The most recent study reported that 12.9% of the

113

symptomatic group and 40% of the asymptomatic group became negative for IgG after 8 weeks,

114

consistent with our findings of up to 99 days or 14 weeks.

A mathematical modeling and extrapolation predicts that

In literature, there are so far few papers on

However, a recent study reported drastic

116

Our current and other related studies point out a conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not elicit a

117

long-last humoral immune memory. Similar to what reported with the SARS-CoV-1 infection (Cao et al.,

118

2007). Our observation and decline kinetics modeling provide a guideline for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

119

designing as how to achieve long-last humoral immune response and memory. One way is to seek

120

immunogens and adjuvants that show very strong immune responses such as virus-specific IgG

induction that can be easily monitored.

comparable to, but not much higher virus-specific IgG production than what we and others observed in

124

hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Xia et al., 2020). Using more potent immunogens and adjuvants to

126

indication for effective development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are highly potent and long-lasting.

127

Although long-term data beyond 99 days after discharge are still in progress and needed to confirm our

128

modeling, our current report provides timely information and fills the gap of knowledge to assess the

129

persistence of antibody levels in response to this novel human coronavirus.

136

patients as did by others (Grifoni et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020). Overall, our data are similar to what

137

reported with SARS-CoV-1 infection: patients recovered from SARS had a rapid IgG decline and

became undetectable after 3 years (Cao et al., 2007).

Figure 1 Changes of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific serum IgG, IgM and IgA levels in 27 convalescent
patients near hospital discharge and at revisit 28-99 days after discharge. (A-C) The antibody levels
are presented as Cut-Off Index (COI) which is calculated as RLU signal divided by the Cut-Off value
previously set for each of IgG, IgM and IgA, respectively. The p values for the difference between
discharge and revisit are < 0.0001, 0.0023 and 0.0020 for IgG, IgM and IgA, respectively. (D-F) Decline
curves for RBD-specific IgG (D), IgM (E) and IgA (F) over time, based on a mathematical model of
exponential decay after its peak at recovery (soon before or at discharge). The ratios of COI at
revisit versus discharge (day 0) is plotted by log10 scale for each patient’s IgG, IgM and IgA separately,
as a function of time (days after discharge). See more details in supplemental Methods. The decay
curve is marked as a blue line, and 95% confidence interval is marked as a grey zone for each type of
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.
