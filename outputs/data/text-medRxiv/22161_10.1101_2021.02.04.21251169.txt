Abstract
Importance: There is an unprecedented need to rapidly identify safe and effective treatments
for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objective: To systematically investigate if any of the available drugs in Electronic Health
Record (EHR), including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, can be repurposed as
potential treatment for COVID-19.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Based on a retrospective cohort analysis of EHR data,
drug-wide association studies (DrugWAS) were performed on COVID-19 patients at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center (VUMC). For each drug study, multivariable logistic regression with
overlap weighting using propensity score was applied to estimate the effect of drug exposure on
COVID-19 disease outcomes.
Exposures: Patient exposure to a drug during 1-year prior to the pandemic and COVID-19
diagnosis was chosen as exposure of interest. Natural language processing was employed to
extract drug information from clinical notes, in addition to the prescription drug data available in
structured format.
Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause of death was selected as primary outcome.
Hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and need for mechanical ventilation
were identified as secondary outcomes.
Results: The study included 7,768 COVID-19 patients, of which 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized,
82 (1.06%) were admitted to ICU, 64 (0.82%) received mechanical ventilation, and 90 (1.16%)
died. Overall, 15 drugs were significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 severity.
Previous exposure to either Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.98), diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus
toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98) were significantly associated with a decreased risk

of death (primary outcome). Secondary analyses identified several other significant associations
showing lower risk for COVID-19 outcomes: 2 vaccines (acellular pertussis, Streptococcus
pneumoniae), 3 dietary supplements (turmeric extract, flaxseed extract, omega-3 fatty acids),
methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, ethinyl estradiol, estradiol, ibuprofen, and
fluticasone.
Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study leveraged EHR data to identify a list of drugs
that could be repurposed to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Further randomized clinical trials are
needed to investigate the efficacy of the proposed drugs.

1. INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has triggered a pandemic infection leading to unprecedented
excess mortality and adverse consequences to global economy.1-3 According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), SARS-CoV-2 has spread to over 222 countries and territories
resulting in >81 million infected individuals and >1.8 million confirmed deaths as of December
2020.4 While significant progress has been achieved to successfully develop and deploy safe
and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,5-9 intensive scientific efforts are currently underway to
discover treatments that improve COVID-19 outcomes, particularly drug treatments that can be
used early in a patient’s illness to prevent hospitalization or death. Recently, the antiviral drug
remdesivir has been proven to reduce the recovery time of adult patients hospitalized with
COVID-19.10 Another study indicated that use of dexamethasone reduces 28-day mortality of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen.11
Monoclonal antibodies have been shown to reduce the viral load and improve clinical outcomes
in outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19.12 Furthermore, several other drugs including
corticosteroids, antiviral therapies, immune-modulators, and anticoagulants are currently
investigated as potential therapies for COVID-19.13-17 Despite recent advances, however, there
is an urgent need for discovering safe and effective treatments that are able to prevent COVID19 progression and long-term complications.18
Because a de novo treatment usually requires many years to reach the market, involves
significant costs, and has a low rate of success, drug repurposing methodologies have emerged
as an attractive strategy to accelerate the discovery of novel COVID-19 treatments.19-21
Leveraging real-world data from Electronic Health Record (EHR), we conducted a drug-wide
association study (DrugWAS) to systematically investigate all recorded drug exposures,
including prescription drugs and dietary supplements, as potential COVID-19 treatments. We

hypothesized that drug exposures associated with a lower risk of death or severe COVID-19
outcomes could identify candidates for further therapeutic study.

2. METHODS
Study Design
DrugWAS is a high-throughput method for independently investigating associations between
drugs and disease outcomes. It relies on a retrospective cohort analysis of data stored in the
Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) Research Derivative, a daily updated database of
identified EHR data restructured for research. Specific data elements extracted from the
Research Derivative include demographics data, laboratory tests, drugs, clinical outcomes,
comorbidities, and clinical notes. The study was approved by the institutional review board at
VUMC. It is presented by following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.22

Study Population
The study included all patients who were tested at VUMC between March 9, 2020 and
December 31, 2020 and were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assay (Figure 1). Being a large medical center in Middle Tennessee, and the
sole provider of COVID-19 testing early in the pandemic, VUMC tested a substantial number of
individuals who never had a care visit at the medical center prior to their test. As the baseline
clinical and drug exposure data for these patients was sparse, and the risk of treatment
misclassification was high, patients without an encounter in the EHR within a 1-year period prior
to February 15, 2020 were excluded. The exclusion date corresponded to the date that COVID19 pandemic was first detected in our geographical area. While no age, gender, race or ethnicity
selection criteria were imposed, patients with missing demographic information (eg, unknown
race) were excluded from the study. At VUMC, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was initially limited to

symptomatic individuals and a selected category of patients who needed to be physically
present in a VUMC facility (eg, pregnant women or patients scheduled for surgery) PCR testing
was required before their visit. These patients, flagged as asymptomatic at the test time, were
excluded from the study since they may increase the false positive rate of COVID-19 outcomes
(eg, admission to hospital of an asymptomatic COVID-19 patient would be likely influenced by
surgery rather than by the COVID-19 diagnosis).

Exposure of Interest
Patient exposure to a drug between February 15, 2019 (approximated as 1-year prior to the
pandemic arriving in our geographical area) and test time was selected as the exposure of
interest for each drug-outcome association study in DrugWAS. All generic and brand drugs
recorded in the EHR for the final study population during this interval were extracted from the
drug table and normalized to drug ingredients using a previously developed drug normalization
pipeline.23 Natural language processing (NLP) was also used to extract drug information from
free-text notes. This process was particularly useful to identify exposure to over-the-counter
drugs or to drugs prescribed by outside providers. For this, we employed MedXN-v1.0.3,24 a
high-performance NLP drug extractor previously evaluated on Vanderbilt EHR,25,26 to parse
>789,000 notes with dates between February 15, 2019 and PCR test time. There was no filter
restriction by note type for NLP-based drug extraction; thus, notes such as problem lists, clinical
communications, and outpatient Rx order summaries were also included in this process.
Diagnostic drug ingredients, excipients, and other non-therapeutic agents (eg, placebo, inert
ingredients) were excluded from the study. Drugs and supplements were assigned a therapeutic
category (drug class) using the Lexicomp® database.

Outcomes

Outcomes were extracted using EHR data from PCR test date until December 31, 2020. Based
on the WHO guidelines on COVID-19 severity scale,27 they were classified as: 1) never
hospitalized, 2) hospitalized with mild conditions and without intensive treatment (hospitalizedmild), 3) admitted to ICU, 4) on mechanical ventilation, and 5) dead. All-cause of death was
selected as primary outcome. Two strategies were designed to combine hospitalized-mild,
admitted to ICU, and on mechanical ventilation into multiple secondary outcomes: 1) cumulative
severity, where a specific category is combined with more severe categories on the scale, and
2) exclusive severity, which includes only the patients from a specific category. For instance, the
cumulative severity strategy for the ICU outcome also includes on ventilator and dead
categories while the exclusive severity for the same outcome includes only the patients in ICU
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Of note, for the primary outcome, both strategies will generate
the same severity group. All the severity groups corresponding to the primary and secondary
outcomes were compared against non-hospitalized, alive COVID-19 patients.

Covariates
Age, sex, race, and ethnicity were selected to account for the differences in patient
characteristics. Additionally, the weighted Elixhauser comorbidity score28,29 was chosen to
account for the severity of medical conditions since multiple comorbidities have been shown to
be associated with COVID-19 outcomes.30,31 The covariate encoding this comorbidity score was
computed by: 1) extracting the International Classification of Diseases, 9th/10th Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9/10-CM) billing codes from each patient record up to the PCR test
time and determining their inclusion in any of the 31 Elixhauser comorbidity groups;32 2)
aggregating the severity scores derived from associations between the 31 comorbidity groups
and the risk of in-hospital death;29 and 3) categorizing the aggregated severity scores into 4
ordinal categories: <0, 0, 1-4, and 5+.33

Statistical Analysis
Patient characteristics were reported as means and standard deviations (SDs) for continuous
variables and counts (percentages) for categorical variables.
For each drug studied, a propensity score method was used to adjust for differences
between the patients exposed to the drug prior to being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (exposed
group) and those not exposed (unexposed group). The propensity score represents the
probability of a patient being assigned to the exposed group conditional on the observed patient
characteristics. In observational, nonrandomized studies, propensity score methods are used to
balance the main patient characteristics across treatment groups, which is essential in reducing
the bias in estimating treatment effects.34-36 In DrugWAS, the propensity score adjustment
played a critical role in reducing the likelihood of confounding (especially confounding by
indication) since patients exposed to drugs are likely to have comorbidities as treatment
indications that may also affect the study outcomes.
This study applied the overlap weighing with a propensity score method. The method
has been shown to achieve high performance under different configurations,37,38 and, recently, it
has been successfully used in estimating the relationship between use of specific drugs and
COVID-19 outcomes.39-41 Specifically, the propensity score for being exposed to a drug was
estimated by a multivariable logistic regression model using age, sex, race, ethnicity, and
weighted Elixhauser comorbidity score. Using the estimated propensity score, a weighted
multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate the effect of drug exposure on both
primary and secondary outcomes, where each patient was weighted with the probability of the
patient being assigned to the opposite exposure group. The estimates of adjusted odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported in the results. Associations
corresponding to a specific outcome were performed for all drugs with at least 100 exposed
patients of whom at least 5 had the outcome. All drugs with corresponding effect estimates
indicating reduced severity risk (OR<1) were reported as potential candidates for COVID-19

treatment repurposing. No adjustment for multiple testing was performed. All statistical analyses
were done in R, version 3.6.1.

3. RESULTS
Patients
The study included 7,768 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The mean age was 42 and the
majority of patients were females (61.3%), whites (84.2%), and non-Hispanic or Latino (96.5%).
From this cohort, 509 (6.55%) were hospitalized and 90 (1.16%) died (Figure 1). Among those
who died, 11 did not have an inpatient visit at VUMC after they were diagnosed with SARSCoV-2 infection. While the weighted Elixhauser comorbidity score indicated a current state of
health for most of the patients, 1,875 (24.1%) of them had severe comorbidity scores (Table 1).
The hospitalized patients had a mean age of 60, and an increased percent of males (49.3%),
blacks (24.8%), and severe comorbidity scores (58.7%).

Primary Outcome
The analysis for the primary outcome consisted of 233 association studies between previous
drug exposure and all-cause of death (eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement). Propensity score
overlap-weighted logistic regression indicated that 49 drugs have lower death risk estimates
(adjusted OR<1). Among these, previous exposures to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype (1,
19A, 3, 5, 6A, 7F) capsular antigen diphtheria CRM197 protein conjugate vaccine (OR, 0.38;
95% CI, 0.14-0.98), Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype (14, 18C, 19F, 23F, 4, 6B, 9V)
capsular antigen diphtheria CRM197 protein conjugate vaccine (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.89),
diphtheria toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98), and tetanus toxoid vaccine (OR, 0.39;
95% CI, 0.15-0.98) are associated with a significantly decreased risk of death. After overlap
weighting with propensity score for the first (and second) Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine
the death rate was 2.1% (1.9%) in the exposed group compared with a death rate of 4.1%

(3.6%) in the unexposed group. For both diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccines, the death rate
was 0.7% vs 1.7% in the exposed and unexposed groups, respectively. Figure 2 and eTable 3
in the Supplement show additional details of the 49 drug studies for the primary outcome while
eTable 4 in the Supplement demonstrates that the overlap weighting achieved a good balance
in main patients characteristics between the exposed and unexposed groups. A sensitivity
analysis where the exposure of interest was extracted using only the information from the drug
table (in structured format) found no significant associations for the primary outcome.

Secondary Outcomes
The secondary outcome analyses lead to the discovery of additional drugs as potential
treatments for COVID-19 (eTables 5-10 in the Supplement). Figure 3 summarizes the
significant associations obtained across all COVID-19 outcomes. In addition to vaccines,
pervious exposure to flaxseed extract, methylprednisolone acetate, pseudoephedrine, omega-3
fatty acids, turmeric extract, ibuprofen, and fluticasone showed significant lower risks for
hospitalized-mild (cumulative and exclusive severity). Furthermore, ethinyl estradiol and
estradiol demonstrated protective effect for hospitalized-mild (cumulative severity).

Risk Trend Analysis
A visual analysis showing the risk trends over the selected outcomes for all 49 drugs from the
primary analysis is depicted in Figure 4. Spline regression was also used to visualize nonlinearity of risk trends across COVID-19 outcomes ordered by increased severity (eFigures 2
and 3 in the Supplement). Drugs including fluticasone, naproxen, flaxseed extract, and omega-3
fatty acids show a constant low risk across the entire COVID-19 severity scale whereas
cephalexin and cyclobenzaprine indicate a protective effect only for the primary outcome.

We presented a high-throughput method to systematically investigate associations between
drug exposures and COVID-19 outcomes. Our study found 15 drug ingredients that are
significantly associated with a decreased risk of death and other severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Moreover, 103 other drug ingredients indicated a protective effect for COVID-19 outcomes. It is
our hope that this proposed list of drug ingredients provides additional insights into developing
efficient COVID-19 treatments and would serve as a starting point for future prospective studies.
Since their short- and long-term adverse events have been already studied, the efficacy of these
drug ingredients against COVID-19 could be investigated rapidly in clinical trials.42
For each drug study, overlap weighting with propensity score was implemented to adjust
for confounding when comparing the drug exposed and unexposed groups. Another significant
contribution of our study is the use of NLP to better capture drug exposure information from
clinical notes. Notably, this process had a critical role in enabling the study of over-the-counter
drugs including dietary supplements as potential COVID-19 treatments.
Some of the significant drug ingredients found in this study replicate previous findings of
potential dug repurposing candidates for COVID-19. Two network-based bioinformatics
approaches found fluticasone as a possible efficient treatment for COVID-1920,43 while an in vitro
study indicated that fluticasone does not suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication.44
Methylprednisolone has been previously shown to be associated with a decreased risk of
death.30 It is currently recommended as a treatment for COVID-19 patients with severe and
critical outcomes when dexamethasone is unavailable.45 In a network-based bioinformatics
analysis pseudoephedrine was ranked as the best treatment candidate against COVID-19.46
Concerns regarding the use of ibuprofen causing potential harm to COVID-19 patients has
initially received significant attention.47-49 More recent studies, however, found no significant
evidence to suggest that ibuprofen is associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.50,51 Further,
an observational study using EHR data from 6 hospitals indicated that exposure to ibuprofen is
associated with a lower risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.64-0.84).52

A retrospective study using EHR data showed a decreased fatality rate for women 50+ years
old receiving estradiol therapy (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18-0.62).53 Multiple clinical trials are
currently underway to test the efficacy and safety of using methylprednisolone (NCT04263402,
NCT04559113, NCT04636671), ibuprofen (NCT04334629, NCT04382768, NCT04383899), and
estradiol (NCT04539626) against COVID-19.
An important finding by our study is that recent exposure to various types of
Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines, diphtheria toxoid vaccine, tetanus toxoid vaccine, and
acellular pertussis vaccine is associated with a decreased risk of death and other severe
COVID-19 outcomes. This may be explained by the ability of these vaccines to stimulate the
immune system and provide immunologic protection against SARS-CoV-2.54 Pneumonia and
influenza vaccination was also suggested to prevent COVID-19 exacerbation due to co-infection
with other viruses.55 To our knowledge, dietary supplements such as flaxseed extract, omega-3
fatty acids, and turmeric extract have not been previously shown to be associated with a
reduced COVID-19 severity risk. However, due to their anti-inflammatory properties, they have
been proposed as alternative treatments to improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19
patients.56-61 Yet, the dietary supplement results should be interpreted with caution since the
corresponding ingredients are not evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration
for safety and effectiveness and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any
disease.

Limitations
Although overlap weighting with propensity score was applied to balance out the main patient
characteristics between the drug exposed and unexposed groups, there may be unmeasured
confounding factors that were not included in the propensity score model. Thus, while the bias
may be reduced, confounding by indication is still possible due to unmeasured confounding

factors. This is a major limitation, generally applicable to observational studies that lack
randomization for drug exposure assignment.40,62
Treatment misclassification was addressed by including only patients with at least one
encounter in the EHR such that drug exposure information could be extracted for each SARSCoV-2 positive patient during at least one year prior to diagnosis. However, EHR phenotyping
pose many challenges which could lead to inaccurately extracting the treatment status of the
patient.63 For example, drug exposure extraction from clinical text relies on accurate
identification of text expressions that are negated (eg, “he could not be on Coumadin because
of history of GI bleed”) or hypothetical (eg, “Zofran 4 mg PO once a day as needed for
nausea”).23,64 This is another reason for interpreting the results of dietary supplements with
caution since they are primarily extracted from clinical notes. Furthermore, assuming drug
exposure information is accurately extracted for a patient, exposure of the drug at and after
diagnosis time is not guaranteed. However, vaccine data in the EHR is not subject to this
limitation.
Misclassification of COVID-19 outcomes was addressed by excluding patients that were
asymptomatic at test time. These patients could introduce bias in the study since, for instance,
they may be admitted to hospital for reasons other than COVID-19. Additionally, despite
including only patients with VUMC as their “medical home”, there could be a small number of
patients among those classified as non-hospitalized who were in fact admitted to another
hospital.
Finally, generalizability has yet to be proven on larger cohorts with a more
heterogeneous study population. In this single-site study, patients are predominantly white, nonHispanic or Latino and relatively young (mean age of 42). Larger cohorts would also enable
conducting subgroup analyses for a specific race, sex, age category, set of comorbidities, drug
dose, drug route, drug exposure intervals, or combination therapy.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Leveraging EHR data, DrugWAS of COVID-19 severity outcomes enables the discovery of drug
ingredients that could be repurposed as potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to the
prescription drugs available in structured format, extracting drug information from clinical notes
using NLP facilitates the study of over-the-counter drugs on improving the recovery of COVID19 patients. The efficacy of the identified drug ingredients needs to be evaluated in prospective
clinical trials using larger and more heterogenous study populations.
