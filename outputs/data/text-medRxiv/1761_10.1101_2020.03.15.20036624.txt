Background: China adopted an unprecedented province-scale quarantine since

19

January 23rd 2020, after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan in

20

December 2019. Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale

21

standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure.

22

There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the

23

testing capacity improvement since the quarantine.

24

Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei

25

Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-

26

linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of

Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased

29

by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the

30

turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of “daily

31

settlement” (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the

32

nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-

33

Yan Laboratory ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases would decrease

34

at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44%

35

and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing

36

capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, “daily

37

settlement” for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately.

38

Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid

39

testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need

40

to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and

41

minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great

42

significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common

times and emergencies.

Introduction

49

To cope with the outbreak of the coronavirus related disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan

50

since December 2019, the unprecedented province-scale quarantine since January 23rd

51

2020 was adopted to prevent the virus from spreading [1,2]. The numerical simulation of

52

Yang et al. [1] quantitatively explained the effectiveness of the series of unprecedented

53

measures taken by the Chinese government, such as extended the Spring Festival

54

holiday, encouraged people to self-quarantined and delayed the resumption of work and

55

school, which successfully reduced the population movement and thereby the virus

transmission.

57
58

The clinical testing method plays irreplaceable role in identifying the infected, cutting

59

off the transmission, and protecting the susceptible. The qRT-PCR based nucleic acid

60

testing is regarded as one of the gold standards for the detection of coronavirus related

61

disease (COVID-19). From January 3rd, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and

62

Prevention (CCDCP) began to distribute nucleic acid testing kits to hospitals and

63

medical institutions, and carried out testings according to their own capabilities.

64

However, the large-scale and standardization nucleic acid testing has always been a

65

problem that troubles the entire disease control system, including the CCDCP, hospitals

66

and clinical laboratories. Quality control of the sampling procedure, equipments, testing

67

kits and processes lack consistency amongst 97 institutions in Hubei Province and more

68

than 40 institutions in Wuhan, making it hard to centralize and scale-up the testings,

69

deliver the results and admit the infected on a timely manner. The above mentioned

70

technical issues of the clinical testing lead to the controversy about the effectiveness of

71

the nucleic acid testing by the doctors, experts and officials, which converted into the

72

social panic. On February 4th, the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan for

73

the novel coronavirus disease even adapted the imaging features of pneumonia (by CT-

74

scanning) as the diagnosis standard of COVID-19 in Hubei Province published by the

75

National Health Commission [3].

76
77

Though the province-scale quarantine is unprecedented, however the number of

78

suspected infections kept increasing due to a series issues with regard to the nucleic

79

acid testing, which leading to serious delay of both diagnosis and hospital admission.

80

To cope with that, the Wuhan government made another key strategic decision to build

81

an emergent clinical virus testing infrastructure on Jan 29th, i.e. the Huo-Yan Laboratory,

82

with a testing capacity over 10,000 per day (Figure 1). Huo-Yan was expanded into a

83

site of 2,000 m2 within a week from an existing laboratory that continuously delivers

84

testing results. Since Huo-Yan put into use on Feb 5th, its testing capacity kept stably

85

increasing due to the automated nucleic acid extraction device and optimization of

86

procedure. Then Huo-Yan have achieved 14,000 testing capacity per day on Feb 9th

87

along with the original site and exceeded 20,000 testing capacity per day on Mar 1st.

88

And finally substantially contributed to achieve the “daily settlement” (no suspected

89

cases each day) raised by Hubei Provincial government starting by Feb 16th. On Feb

90

19th, the sixth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan for the novel coronavirus

91

disease [3] recalled the practice of using imaging features of pneumonia for the diagnosis

92

of COVID-19 in Hubei Province.

93
94

Testing is the key to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, for only by

95

identifying the infected can they be isolated and treated, as well as to stop the

96

transmission. So far, there was no empirical data and numeric model to clarify the

97

impact of standardized and large-scale clinical testing platform on the prevention and

98

control of contagion. Here we present a novel differential model with non-linear

99

transfer coefficients and competitive compartments to evaluate the trends of suspected

100

cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities.

112

hospitals, the local disease control and prevention institutions and the clinical testing

113

laboratories in Hubei Province increased from c.a. 3,000 to over 30,000 tests per day.

114

In the period of simulation (Feb 25th-March 6rd), Huo-Yan had finished over 163,000

115

testings by March 6th, with a team of 130 personals. Besides, the 20 teams of 83

116

personals sent by CCDCP together with local lab professionals and supporting

117

personals, had finished 105,641 testings by the end of February. In Wuhan, the 23 most

118

qualified hospitals could perform over 7,000 tests per day. The specifics of the testing

119

carried out in Hubei Province were as follows:

120

1) From January 19th, since the testing kits became available to hospitals and medical

121

institutions, the daily testing capacity (TC) of Hubei Province was expected to be over

122

3,000;

123

2) From Jan. 26th to Feb. 11th, the daily testing capacity of clinical testing laboratories

124

increased rapidly. Testing capacity of the Huo-Yan Laboratory, TCHY (t) increased to

125

10,000 per day on Feb 4th, and Huo-Yan accounted for 30%-45% of the testing in Hubei

126

Province.

127

3) From February 11th to March 1st, TCHY (t) increased from 10,000 to 20,000 per day，

128

delivered 40%-50% of the testing results in Hubei Province.

129
130

Estimation of the total infected population of novel coronavirus and other pathogens

131

According to the modified SEIR model by Yang et al [1], after taken the whole province

132

quarantine measures in Hubei, the infected cases decreased from 43,000 on Feb 25th to

133

34,000 on Mar 6th. The suspected patents were usually with characteristics of fever and

134

influenza-like illnesses (ILIs), and the existing epidemiological data showed an

135

incremental trend of ILIs patients from 2015 to 2017 in Wuhan, along with annual ILIs

136

prevalence of 4.5% in Wuhan [4]. The ILIs cases in the 1st quarter of each year accounted

137

for about 20% (varying from 17% to 46%), therefore we estimated the annual total

138

infected patients of ILIs other than coronavirus could be over 460,000 in the first quarter

of 2020 in Hubei Province, which would lead to over 5,000 patients with similar

140

symptom of COVID-19 per day.

141
142

Model for predicting suspected cases

143

A novel model was used to illustrate the influence of testing capacity on the prevention

144

and control of COVID-19 (Figure 3). Unlike the common dynamic model used only

145

linear differential equations, this model applied the increasement of testing capacity

146

into account. Since the quarantine measures in Hubei, the contact probability among

147

people was reduced, which significantly reduced the possibility of large-scale

148

transmission. Meanwhile, due to quarantine, people were more alert to fever and other

149

symptoms, leading to more patients surged into the hospital and a continuous

150

increasement suspected cases. The purpose of nucleic acid testing was to 1) identify

151

patients with COVID-19 from the uninfected, and allow them to be hospitalized; 2)

152

after the symptoms disappear, the inpatient with more than twice negative testing results

153

(the interval must be more than 24 hours) could be discharged [3].

154
155

The conversion efficiency from suspected to hospital admission depended on the testing

156

capacity (TC(t)), the number of existing and newly discovered the suspected cases,

157

however there was a bottleneck of nucleic acid testing. As soon as the daily testing

158

capacity was greater than the existing suspected plus the newly suspected of the day,

159

the “daily settlement” of suspected cases could be achieved.

Results

193

The simulation result corresponded well with the trend of suspected cases by Health

194

Commission of Hubei Province, and the positive rate of the tests per day was around

195

50%, also consistent with the positive rate data from Huo-Yan. The effect of increased

196

testing capacity was significant, which was largely up to the government’s decision and

197

the expansion of the hospitals and clinical testing laboratories (Figure 4).

198
199

Due to the insufficient testing capacity at the beginning of the province-scale quarantine,

200

the number of suspected cases rose to over 23,000, which became a “dammed lake” for

201

delayed diagnosis and led to social panic.

202
203

If the testing capacity did not rapidly increased, the suspected cases could have reached

204

a maximum of 33,700, resulting in a doubled isolation cost in term of room-days and

205

ten thousands medical personals in addition to the over 40,000 medical workers and

206

doctors which had been sent to Hubei Province. The diagnosis for over 30,000

207

suspected cases would be delayed, half of which are positive results and could cause

208

further transmission. The turning point of the increment of suspected cases would be

209

delayed for 6 days and the achievement of “daily settlement” would be realized at least

210

11 days later.

211
212

If the established testing capacity was fully used, over 22,800 suspected cases could be

213

diagnosed on time rather than being delayed, and accordingly, the isolation cost could

214

be reduced by at least 72%, the turning point of the increment of suspected cases could

215

arrive one week earlier, and “daily settlement” could be realized 12 days in advance.

216
217

Under the ideal scenario, if Hubei Province was capable of carrying out more than

218

10,500 tests per day at the very beginning of the epidemic, there would be no “suspected

219

cases” in the daily official COVID-19 epidemic report, but only the number of

220

diagnosed cases, i.e., either positive or negative, because all of the suspected cases

221

would be “settled” daily.

222
223

Conclusions

224

Novel coronavirus related diseases have been officially defined as pandemic on March

225

11th 2020 by WHO. The quarantine of an entire district, city or a region could be

226

adopted as part of the measures by the government. In Italy, more than 15 million people

227

were placed in the country-based quarantine on March 8th [5]. Spain has announced it is

228

placing its 47 million citizens under partial lockdown for 15 days. Hereby it would be

229

worth determining the required testing capacity, referring Huo-Yan as an example in

230

the public decision-making process. Timely and accurate clinical test is essential for

231

identifying the infected, cutting off the transmission, and protecting the susceptible. The

232

large-scale, precise, and reliable testing capacity is highly required to reduce the panic

233

accompanied by the drastic quarantine measures.

234
235

To increase the testing capacity is a systematic project, among which the qualified

236

laboratory spaces, the standardize of training medical panels, the supplement of the

237

equipment, reagents, consumables and protective materials, and the automation of the

238

testing procedure were of most importance. Here are the suggestions deduced from the

239

simulation:

241

1) The large-scale standardize testing platform and QC protocols were the premise of

242

in the quarantine, which were the prerequisite for the diagnosis of suspected cases,

243

isolate infectious patients, release isolation of convalescent and uninfected healthy

244

population, and also the screening of key communities and groups. The practice

245

from the centered platform could be summarized and replicated to other laboratories.

246

The quality of the diagnostic kits and the accuracy, timeliness, safeties of the

247

laboratories must be constantly compared and inspected. Unstandardized testing

248

process would cause inconsistency in testing results and led to distrust on the testing

249

results.

250

2) Encourage the laboratories to increase testing capacities and keep continues

251

delivery results at the same time. During emergencies, any changes in the testing

252

process could cause samples accumulation, and the best solution could be continues

253

applying new knowledge, know-hows in small scale and quickly replicate to the

254

whole testing assembly line. This principle works in deploying new laboratory

255

spaces, automation equipment, SOP and etc.

256

3) Keep the outsourcing clinical testing laboratory the same priority and responsibility

257

as the in-house laboratories. Despite of the high efficiency of the outsourcing

258

laboratory, some hospitals are not willing to perform the outsourcing diagnostic

259

tests just because they regard the risk of inaccurate testing results of the outsourcing

260

laboratories “incontrollable”.

261

4) Central planning of the diagnostic testing and comprehensive tracking of the

262

potential testing capability to achieve “daily settlement”. Once there are standardize

263

testing capacity, arrange the samples to fill the excess capacity immediately.

264

5) Sufficiently supplement the sampling kits and the corresponding trainings to the

265

medical panels. Other issues that require training on the sampling process including

266

the barcoding and information input of the samples, and the inactivation of the

267

pathogen before testing.

269

infrastructure for both common time and emergencies against contagion, and should

270

be put into use as early as possible in any epidemic. A good estimation of the testing

271

capacity for nucleic acid testing of COVID-19 could be over 10,500 samples per

272

day for a region of 60 million population with over 43,000 infected patients.

273
274

With Huo-Yan Laboratory as a reference model, combining with high-throughput

275

sequencing, nucleic acid detection, immunoprotein analysis and other large-scale

276

standardized and automated analysis methods, we can build infrastructure in the field

277

of public health against the pandemic, so that large and small cities could have their

278

own detection capabilities of 100 to 1,000 or 10,000 people when facing various

279

epidemics, we can take it easy to ensure our life safety, biological safety and economic

safety.
