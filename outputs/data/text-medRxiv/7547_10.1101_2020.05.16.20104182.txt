Abstract
Since December 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is outbreak from China and
infected more than 4,666,000 people and caused thousands of deaths. Unfortunately, the
infection numbers and deaths are still increasing rapidly which has put the world on the
catastrophic abyss edge. Application of artificial intelligence and spatiotemporal
distribution techniques can play a key role to infection forecasting in national and
province levels in many countries. As methodology, the presented study employs long
short-term memory-based deep for time series forecasting, the confirmed cases in both
national and province levels, in Iran. The data were collected from February 19, to
March 22, 2020 in provincial level and from February 19, to May 13, 2020 in national
level by nationally recognised sources. For justification, we use the recurrent neural
network, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, Holt winter's exponential
smoothing, and moving averages approaches. Furthermore, the mean absolute error,
mean squared error, and mean absolute percentage error metrics are used as evaluation
factors with associate the trend analysis. The results of our experiments show that the
LSTM model is performed better than the other methods on the collected COVID-19
dataset in Iran.

demand for health services, shortcoming of medical
protection, lack of expertise and mismanagements in
developing countries has caused many difficulties for
COVID-19 controlling and preventions. However,
classifying and identifying sensitive areas in spatiotemporal
distribution and transmissions of COVID-19, can be an
important strategy to prevent the spread of the virus to other
regions. Time series techniques based on deep learning can
be proper approaches to forecast the behaviour of virus in
order to achieve a correct and reliable prediction. Deep
learning models for time series are used to predict the
number of coronavirus infections over time. These models
can forecast the near future and help to reduce the negative
effects of the coronavirus.
In this article, we propose a deep-based approach for time
series COVID-19 dataset to forecast the near future. We
collect the data from February 19, to March 22, 2020 in
provincial level and from February 19, to May 13, 2020 in
national level by nationally recognised sources in Iran. Our
experimental results show the effectiveness of the used

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 is known as COVID-19 or
2019-nCoV which is an infectious disease. This virus leads
to acute respiratory syndrome in many patients. It is also
known as SARS-CoV-2 and is currently considered as
international public health emergency [1]. The first alarm of
COVID-19 disease was in December 2019 in Wuhan (capital
of Hubei province) in China and has since spread globally
were ongoing today as coronavirus pandemic [2,3]. The
Secretary-General of the United Nations describes the
COVID-19 disease as a global catastrophe 4 which directly
threatens the human health, and affects the economic, social,
environmental developments all around the world. This
disease may change characteristics and epidemic mutates
spatially and geographically based on global environmental
changes which have not yet been sufficiently recognised [5].
In the other hand, by rapidity globalisation and concentration
of population in cities, non-compliance of supply and

infection data were not announced and this is the reason for
collecting only until this date. It should be noted that the
studied data are gathered by presented sources and conducted
the long short-term memory-based deep learning (LSTM
network) and several comparisons algorithms on the original
data which has no interference on infections database in the
studied time period.

2.2 Time series forecasting procedure
2. Materials and Methods

The long short-term memory-based deep learning
approach known as LSTM network used to the time series
forecasting of infectious rate in Iran in two provinces and
national levels from specific time period. Unlike traditional
recurrent neural networks (RNN) where rewritten content at
any time steps, the LSTM neural network is able to make
decisions about retaining current memory through the
specific gates. Intuitively, if the LSTM unit detects an
important feature in the input sequence in the initial steps, it
can easily transmit this information over a long distance.
Therefore, it receives and maintains such long-term
dependencies [12,13]. Time series forecasting can be found
in several application domains, such as business, economics,
inventory control, weather forecasting, and signal processing.
By using LSTM’s time-related advantages for infection
development forecasting, we are able to forecast temporal
near future and contagious progress in Iran. In this regard,
the provinces datasets (province level) are trained for 22 days
and then tested for 12 days, all infection until 22 March in
Iran increased to 21638 cases. Meanwhile, for entire country
(national level) dataset is trained for 67 days and then tested
for 19 days where covered the infection data from February
19 to May 13, 2020 (86 days). The LSTM neural network
was implemented with Adam optimizer; the implementation
was in TensorFlow (Python deep learning library).

Since COVID-19 disease outbreak from the Wuhan city in
China to the whole world, the scientists and specialists have
different paths to recognising, analysing, controlling,
improving, and cure this disease. In this circumstance,
several epidemiological models are introduced by scholars
which highly useful for estimating the dynamic transmission,
targeting resources, and intervention strategies [6,7].
Therefore, the accurate forecasting of the future of COVID19 requires the utilised of artificial intelligence techniques to
overcome epidemiological models limitations. The presented
study uses the long short term memory-based deep learning
for time series forecasting of COVID-19 infectivity
spatiotemporal distribution in Iran.

2.1 Data description
In this study, we collected COVID-19 confirmed data
from February 19 (first infected) to March 22, 2020 in
provincial level and February 19 to May 13, 2020 in national
level. The provincial level data sources are from Iran
ministry
of
health
and
medical
education
(http://behdasht.gov.ir) [8], Islamic republic news agency,
IRNA (https://www.irna.ir) [9] and Iranian student’s news
agency, ISNA (http://www.isna.ir) [10] reports. The national
level data sources are from Iran ministry of health and
medical education, statements of Dr. Kianush Jahanpur
(spokesman for Iran ministry of health and medical
education). Fig. 1 presents the infectivity rate as first day in
31 provinces of Iran. Furthermore, the Fig. 2 shows the
infection variation during the February 19 to March 22, 2020
in each province. As seen in these figures, the Tehran,
Isfahan, Mazandaran, Qom, Gilan, Alborz, Markazi,
Khorasan Razavi, East-Azarbaijan, and Yazd provinces have
the most affected and high risk until March 22, 2020.
Prevalence of COVID-19 in Iran started on February 19,
2020 according to the report of the worldometers website
[11]. Base on the report of the ministry of the health in Iran,
by 2 reported COVID-19 cases, the virus is spread all over
the country (on March 22, the confirmed cases reach to
21638). Fig. 3 shows the province level of the national
distribution maps for new COVID-19 confirmed cases in
Iran. It is noteworthy that after March 22, the province level

2.3 Justification progress
In order to assess the capability of used technique, we
used several forecasting methods to evaluate the results. We
employed recurrent neural network (RNN), seasonal
autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), Holt
winter's exponential smoothing (HWES), moving averages
approaches in the comparisons. Some scholar used the
forecast for the trend analysis of COVID-2019 pandemic
development [14–21]. Thus, in this study RNN, SARIMA,
HWES and Moving Average methods used as comparative
procedures for LSTM. Meanwhile, the mean absolute error
(MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) criteria’s [22,23] are used as
evaluation metrics.

confirmed cases until March 22, 2020. This statistic has
shifted significantly between March 3 to 5 and March 10 to
13, 2020; but the infections number has fallen in recent days,
see Fig. 4. The LSTM based forecasting is very close to real
data and the model error rate is very low for all used metrics.
After Tehran, Isfahan has a high number of confirmed
infection cases with nearly about 9.1 percent on March 22,
2020. According to Fig. 5, the predicted data from the LSTM
model for Isfahan is very close to reality. On March 5 to 8
and March 11 to 15 has significant shift in infections
numbers in this province. The highest pollution level for
Isfahan is on March 11 which is also the first peak day of
comparison, see Fig. 5b. Mazandaran province had the third
most risk-able provinces of Iran until March 22, 2020 with
about 7.9% of confirmed infection cases as shown in Fig. 6.
The highest incidence days in this province are on March 6,
7, and 13 with 180, 305, and 192 cases. Qom province was
about 6.3% of all infection until reviewed date, as shown in

3. Results and Discussion
In order to forecasting the time series two steps are
considered for evaluating the COVID-19 pandemic
development in Iran which are the province and national
levels. In province level, we select 4 critical provinces,
named Tehran, Isfahan, Mazandaran, and Qom, see Fig. 3.
Based on the results of LSTM, we observed that high quick
infections in near future for these provinces. As national
level, the algorithm implemented to assess and forecast
COVID-19 prevalence in the country at coming days. In the
second experiment, we employ 33 days collected data for the
provinces. In this dataset we consider 22 days as training and
12 days as test data. Figures 4 to 7 show the results of time
series forecasting for Tehran, Isfahan, Mazandaran, and Qom
provinces.
The Tehran city with about 22.7% of the total number of
infections is the first place in Iran which has the largest

Fig. 7. According to the results for these provinces the
LSTM based algorithm has very high performance to
forecast the infection rates.In national level, the prepared
data (data sources mainly from Iran Ministry of Health and
Medical Education [8]) which is gathered from February 19
to May 13, 2020 for entire country. Based on the collected 86
days’ data, 67 days are selected for training and 19 days for
testing in the LSTM network. The total number of infected
cases on May 13, 2020 was 112,725 which are obtained daily
in this study. By evaluating and comparing to other methods,
the proposed model has the highest proximity to reality in
terms of forecasting. Furthermore, based on the error rate
(MAE, MSE, MAPE), the proposed model has less error rate
compare to RNN. Figure 8 shows the forecasting progress
for the national level variation of the infection cases in Iran.
As seen in this figure, the LSTM-based forecasting has
higher accuracy. Meanwhile, figure 9 depicts the results of
probable future in the next 21 days. According to this figure,
we observe a descending course for infection development in
Iran in coming two weeks.

4. Conclusion
The presented study attempted to use the LSTM neural
network for time series modelling and forecasting of
COVID-19 disease in Iran in the provincial and national
levels. Provincial data collected from February 19 to March
22, 2020 and national data collected from February 19 to
May 13, 2020 based on nationally recognised sources (e.g.
Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education; IRNA;
ISNA). As methodology, the proposed model used a long
short-term memory-based deep learning. We also compared
the model to RNN, SARIMA, HWES, and moving averages
approaches. Meanwhile, the MAE, MSE, and MAPE metrics
were used to comparisons. Based on our experimental
results, the LSTM model performed better than the other
methods and gave less error values for infection development
in Iran. According to the results, it can be stated that in the
last days of the week, the infection cases will be decrease if
the people follow current conditions and avoid crowded
areas. According to the proposed model, the downward trend
is likely to continue for up to three weeks (it should be noted
that the rate of COVID-19 decay depends on various factors
such as the person’s immune system, contact with others,
underlying disease, exposure to polluted cities, noncompliance with social distances, travel to polluted cities and
other factors). It seems that by the forecasting and
evaluations, Iran has passed the first peak of the disease, but
is possible to return the second disease peak in probable
future.
