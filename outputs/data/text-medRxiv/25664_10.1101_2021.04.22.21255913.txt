The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general
community is still unclear. Here, we used the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection
Survey, a large community-based survey of individuals living in randomly selected private households
across the UK, to assess the effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
(Oxford-AstraZeneca; ChAdOx1) vaccines against any new SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests, split
according to self-reported symptoms, cycle threshold value (<30 versus 30) as a surrogate for viral
load, and gene positivity pattern (compatible with B.1.1.7 or not). Using 1,945,071 RT-PCR results
from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May
2021, we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV2 infections 21 days after the first dose (61%, 95% CI 54 to 68% versus 66%, 95% CI 60 to 71%,
respectively) with greater reductions observed after a second dose (79%, 95% CI 65 to 88% versus
80%, 95% CI 73 to 85%, respectively). Largest reductions were observed for symptomatic infections
and/or infections with a higher viral burden. Overall, COVID-19 vaccination reduced the number of
new SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the largest benefit received after two vaccinations and against
symptomatic and high viral burden infections, and with no evidence of difference between the
BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines.

Initially, those in care homes, over 80 years old, and frontline health and social care workers were
prioritised for vaccination4. Clinically vulnerable people and those ≥70 years were the next priority
groups, followed by remaining adults in decreasing age order. As of 14 April, over 32 million (62%) UK
adults (≥18 years old) had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose5, and mostly one dose only
following the extension of the dosing interval to 12 weeks to maximise initial coverage6. UK
inhabitants were invited to receive a COVID-19 vaccine independent of antibody status, although
those testing PCR positive just before their scheduled vaccination had to reschedule their
appointment to a later date to minimise the chances of an outbreak at vaccination sites.

Large randomised trials estimated efficacy against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
infection of 70% (95% CI 55% to 81%) after two ChAdOx1 doses7, and 95% (95% CI 90% to 98%) after
two BNT162b2 doses8. Whilst trials provide unbiased effect estimates, trial participants may differ
from the general population in many ways, and so it is essential to assess effectiveness in the
community, particularly given differences between real-world vaccine deployment and the licenced
dosing schedule. Comparing vaccine effectiveness in the community is also important as the trials
used different outcome definitions (e.g. start of at-risk period 147 vs 78 days after the second dose)
and populations (e.g. smaller proportion >55 years in the ChAdOx1 vaccine trial (12%7 vs 42% for
BNT162b28)).

Furthermore, both trials were largely conducted before the SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7, became
dominant in the UK9. This variant is more transmissible and potentially causes more severe disease10-

Ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of different vaccines across different subgroups is critical –
especially amongst older adults, who were underrepresented in the ChAdOx1 trials. Real-world
studies are starting to appear, with an analysis from Israel estimating 92% (95%CI 88 to 95%)
effectiveness against symptomatic PCR-confirmed infection ≥7 days after the second BNT162b2
dose15. A study among healthcare workers in England found an effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55-85%)
21 days after a first dose and 85% (95% CI 74-96%) after a second dose of BNT162b2 against PCRpositive infections16. Another study assessing the early effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1
vaccine in older adults (≥70 years) in England showed a single dose of either vaccine was ~60%
effective against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed infection and ~80% effective against
hospitalisation17. The evidence on effectiveness against asymptomatic infection is limited, with one
study among 13,109 healthcare workers from Oxfordshire, UK, showing a 64% (95% CI 50 to 74%)
reduction in any SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive result following a single BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 dose9.
Another study among 3,950 healthcare workers, first responders, and other essential and frontline
workers from the US estimated 80% (95%CI 59 to 90%) and 90% (95%CI 68 to 97%) vaccine
3

On 8 December 2020, the UK was the first country to start a COVID-19 vaccination programme
following the emergency use authorisation of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNtech) by UK’s
Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency1. Additional COVID-19 vaccines have since been
approved, including the Oxford-AstraZeneca adenovirus-vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCOV-19
(termed here ChAdOx1)2, and more recently an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by
Moderna, mRNA-12733. To date, most vaccinated individuals in the UK received one or two doses of
the BNT162b2or ChAdOx1 vaccines, which are the vaccines focused on in the current study.

. Concerns have been raised that some of its defining mutations may affect the efficacy of vaccines
and natural infection-derived immunity to (re)infection13. A subset of 8,534 participants from the
initial ChAdOx1 trial were followed for a longer period to assess protection against different viral
variants, but wide confidence intervals meant it was difficult to conclude whether efficacy was lower
against B.1.1.7 (70%, 95%CI 44% to 85%) than other lineages (82%, 95%CI 70% to 89%)14.

effectiveness 14 or more days after 1 or 2 doses of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines
respectively18. Most recently, a study in 10,412 residents of long-term care facilities showed 65% and
68% protection against SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive results 28-42 days after vaccination with ChAdOx1
and BNT162b2 vaccines respectively19.

However, existing studies have either investigated defined sub-populations9 18 19 or have relied on
results from symptomatic testing programmes15 17, potentially leading to bias from vaccination status
influencing test-seeking behaviour of cases not requiring healthcare. Large community-based studies
where testing is done in a systematic manner (independent of both vaccination status and
symptoms) are lacking. We therefore used the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection
Survey (CIS) – a large community-based survey of individuals aged 2 years and older living in
randomly selected private households across the UK – to assess the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and
ChAdOx1 vaccines – as implemented in the UK – against any SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test performed
in the survey20, where RT-PCR tests were done on a fixed schedule, irrespective of symptoms, vaccine
status and prior infection. We assessed vaccine effectiveness based on overall RT-PCR positivity, and
split according to self-reported symptoms, cycle threshold (Ct) value (<30 versus 30) as a surrogate
for viral load, and gene positivity pattern (compatible with B.1.1.7 or not).

From 1st December 2020 to 8th May 2021, 383,812 individuals from 216,953 households provided
1,945,071 RT-PCR results from nose and throat swabs in the COVID-19 Infection Survey (median [IQR]
5 [4 to 6]), of which 12,826 (0.8%) were the first positive in an infection episode and 1,932,245
(99.3%) were negative. The characteristics at each visit where these swabs were taken, and hence
included in analyses, are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The median (IQR) age at included visits
was 55 years (40 to 68), 6% occurred in those reporting non-white ethnicity, 4% reporting patientfacing health/social care work or working in a care home (high priority group for vaccination), and
27% reporting a long-term health condition (priority group for vaccination).

We classified each visit according to vaccination status and previous infection (Supplementary Table
2), classifying time from vaccination empirically based on modelling days since first vaccination as a
continuous non-linear effect (Extended Data Fig. 1). The baseline group was visits occurring >21 days
before vaccination in those with no evidence of previous infection (1,012,808 visits, 10,721 new PCRpositives). 21,442 visits (105 PCR-positives) occurred in unvaccinated participants with evidence of
previous infection, a median 125 days (IQR 106 to 161) from first positive (study antibody, study
swab, or external test in the national programme) to included visit. As <4% visits in each vaccinated
group occurred in individuals with evidence of previous infection before vaccination (Supplementary
Table 2), visits were classified based on vaccination history alone. As there was insufficient data to
estimate effects of vaccination dependent on previous infection status, we therefore estimate the
effectiveness of vaccination as implemented in the UK. 137,575 visits (95 PCR-positives) occurred a
median 16 days (IQR 7 to 30) after a second dose; among the 99,267 individuals that received a
second dose, the median days between the first and second dose was 73 (IQR 63 to 77).

In new infections, Ct values (inversely related to viral load) increased with increasing time from first
vaccination and number of doses (Figure 1A; Supplementary Table 3). The highest Ct values were in
those who had received two vaccine doses, with a similar distribution to those not vaccinated but
previously PCR or antibody-positive. Ct values were lowest in those not vaccinated and not
previously PCR or antibody-positive.

The percentage of PCR-positive cases self-reporting symptoms was highest in those not vaccinated
and not previously PCR or antibody-positive (58% >21 days prior vaccination), and lowest in those
with two vaccine doses (17%) and those not vaccinated but previously PCR or antibody-positive ≥4
months ago (10%, Figure 1B). Well-recognised COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, loss of taste/smell)
were most commonly reported in unvaccinated individuals and not previously PCR or antibodypositive.

In unadjusted analyses, the percentage of positive PCR tests remained stable over the first 20 days
following vaccination, but decreased from 21 days onwards regardless of having received one or two
doses (Extended Data Fig. 2). Adjusting for multiple potential confounders, the vaccine effectiveness
[(1-odds ratio)*100] against new PCR-positives, with or without symptoms, was 56% (95% CI 51 to
61%) in those 8 to 20 days after vaccination versus the baseline group, with no evidence of a
difference versus those vaccinated 0 to 7 days ago (P=0.251). Vaccine effectiveness was 64% (95% CI
59 to 68%; P<0.001) in those ≥21 days since first vaccination with no second dose, marginally more
than those vaccinated 8 to 20 days ago (P=0.066) (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table 4; coefficients for
all factors in Supplementary Table 5). Odds of testing positive were reduced 72% (95% CI 70 to 75%)

The largest vaccine effectiveness was estimated among those post second vaccine dose (80%, 95% CI
74 to 84%; P<0.001), significantly greater than for those having received only one dose ≥21 days
previously (P<0.001). There was no evidence that reductions in odds of testing positive differed
between having received two vaccine doses and not being vaccinated but PCR or antibody-positive
>4m previously (P=0.523) (Supplementary Table 4).

The benefits associated with vaccination were much greater for infection episodes with Ct<30 as
evidence of high levels of viral shedding compared with Ct≥30 (Figure 2B), with vaccine effectiveness
against testing positive with Ct<30 estimated at 91% (95% CI 85 to 94%; P<0.001 post-second dose),
a greater benefit compared to the 75% (69% to 79%) effectiveness following one dose ≥21 days ago
(P<0.001) and with no evidence of difference versus those not vaccinated but PCR or antibodypositive >4m previously (P=1.00). Similarly, benefits associated with vaccination were much greater
for self-reported symptomatic infection episodes (Figure 2C), with an estimated vaccine effectiveness
against testing positive with self-reported symptoms of 95% (95% CI 90 to 97%; P<0.001) post-second
dose, significantly higher than with one dose ≥21 days ago (P<0.001) (Supplementary Table 4), but
again without evidence of difference versus those not vaccinated but PCR or antibody-positive >4m
previously (P=1.00). In comparison, the estimated vaccine effectiveness against new infection
episodes with no self-reported symptoms was 58% (95% CI 43 to 69%; P<0.001) post-second dose.
Whilst overlapping, positives with Ct<30 also differed to positives reporting symptoms e.g. 4,731
(37%) of all positives had Ct <30 and symptoms reported, and 2,125 (17%) had Ct<30 and no
symptoms reported (Supplementary Table 3). Effects of vaccination on infections compatible and
not compatible with the B.1.1.7 variant appeared similar, but small numbers of positives in the latter
group led to large uncertainty in estimates (Figure 2D; Supplementary Table 4).

There was no evidence that vaccine effectiveness against new infections differed between the
BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccine (Figure 3A; Supplementary Table 6) whether the vaccine was
received 0 to 7 days ago (P=0.799), 8 to 20 days ago (P=1.00), ≥21 days ago (P=0.940), or post second
dose (P=0.709). ≥21 days after the first dose , the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines
was 66% (95% CI 60 to 71%) versus 61% (95% CI 54 to 68%), respectively and after 2 doses 80%
(95% CI 73 to 85%) versus 79% (95% CI 65 to 88%) respectively. There was also no evidence that
reductions in odds of new infections differed between those post second BNT162b2 dose and those
not vaccinated but PCR or antibody-positive >4m previously (P=0.704). Effects were similar
considering infections with Ct<30 and 30 (Figure 3B), and with and without self-reported symptoms
(Figure 3C), with the impact of both vaccines attenuated to similarly degrees for infections with
Ct30 and without self-reported symptoms.

There was evidence of differences in the effect of vaccination on new infection between those aged
under or over 75 years (global heterogeneity for all vaccination terms P=0.011, Figure 4A). This was
driven by greater benefits in those ≥21 days since first vaccination with no second dose, where
reductions in odds were 72% in those aged ≥75 (95% CI 64 to 78% reduction) and 60% in those <75
(95% CI 54 to 65%) (interaction P=0.007). There was no evidence of differences in the effect of
vaccination on new infection between those reporting or not reporting long-term health conditions
(global heterogeneity for all vaccination terms P=0.897).

While most potential confounders are unlikely affected by vaccination itself, work location, mode of
travel to work, and contacts with care homes including visiting relatives, could theoretically be both
confounders and affected through vaccination and prior infections through risk compensation.
Sensitivity analyses excluding these factors resulted in nearly identical estimates for visits 1-21 days
before vaccination, and very similar vaccine effectiveness ≥21 days since first vaccination with no
second dose (64%, 95% CI 59 to 68% versus 60%, 95% CI 54 to 65%) and post second dose (80%, 95%
CI 74 to 83% versus 77%, 95% CI 70 to 82%) (Supplementary Table 7) .

The Ct threshold of <30> was selected on the basis of it being used in the UK for algorithms for
review of low level positives at the laboratories where the PCR tests were performed and as a
threshold for attempting whole genome sequencing. We also performed a sensitivity analysis with an
arbitrary threshold of Ct <25> and found this increased the estimated vaccine effectiveness against
‘low Ct’ and ‘high Ct’ infections as lowering this threshold shifts both groups to a lower Ct value
(higher viral load). For example, the estimated effectiveness ≥21 days after the first dose was 79%
(95% CI 73 to 84%) for Ct <25 and 55% (95% CI 47 to 61%) for Ct≥25, while these values are 75% (95%
CI 69 to 79%) and 50% (41 to 58%) with a threshold of 30, respectively.

The main study strength is its design as a large-scale community survey recruiting from randomly
selected private residential households, providing a representative sample of the UK general
population. Participants are tested regardless of symptoms, allowing us to additionally consider
vaccine effectiveness against infection without reported symptoms. The availability of Ct values
allowed us to compare vaccine impact on viral loads, using Ct as a proxy21. Scheduled visits provide
an unbiased sampling frame which we exploited for our logistic regression, rather than having to
censor individuals at last tests in the study using time-to-event analyses, and assume all infections
between visits were identified. Participants were asked about demographics, behaviours, and work,
allowing us to control for a wide range of potential confounders that are unavailable in record
linkage studies performed to date.15

The study design also has limitations, particularly with individuals tested initially at weekly and then
monthly visits. Vaccination status was based on self-report in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland,
potentially leading to some exposure misclassification. However, the vast majority of visits were for
people living in England, where there was good agreement between self-reported and administrative
vaccination data (98% on type and 95% on date). Antibody status was only measured in a subsample
of study participants, meaning that some participants infected before joining the survey or not
detected at survey visits will be misclassified as having no prior antibody-positive test. Similarly, any
positive episodes occurring between visits and not captured by the national testing programme will
be missed, leading to contamination of the “not vaccinated, no previous PCR or antibody-positive”
groups, possibly diluting the observed effects of vaccination. We used national testing programme
positives only for exposure classification to avoid potential bias due to testing behaviour being
influenced by vaccination and prior infection status. However, because participants can therefore
only have a new positive outcome at scheduled visits, some of the “new” positives episodes could
have occurred sometime previously; we therefore stratified time from vaccination to reduce the
impact of this. Older infections would be expected to have a higher Ct values, which might partly
explain the differences between positives with Ct<30 and 30, at least shortly after vaccination.
Imperfect sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests may bias absolute risk, but would result in unbiased
relative risk provided that outcome misclassification is non-differential to vaccination status and all
non-cases are correctly classified (i.e. 100% specificity). PCR test specificity is likely very high
(>99.99%)12 20, and therefore any bias here is expected to be small. Due to relatively small numbers of
infections post-vaccination, power to detect differences between vaccine types and differential
vaccine effectiveness in subgroups was relatively low.

260
261
262

An important potential issue with observational studies evaluating vaccine effectiveness is that
individuals are not supposed to be vaccinated if they tested positive in the last 4 weeks,22 and
individuals may reduce their number of contacts in response to the knowledge that they will soon

The results from this large community surveillance study show that vaccination against COVID-19,
with either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 - vaccine, significantly reduced the odds of individuals testing PCRpositive with a new SARS-CoV-2 infection, with greatest reductions in new infections observed in
individuals with Ct<30 and self-reported symptoms, and in those who had received 2 vaccine doses.
Reductions afforded by vaccination were similar to those not vaccinated but PCR or antibody-positive
>4m previously. The protective effect of vaccination was more pronounced in infections with Ct<30
and with self-reported symptoms. There was no evidence of any difference in effectiveness between
BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines, or in those with long-term health conditions. We observed greater
reductions in new infections in those aged ≥75 years versus those under 75 after one dose, but this
difference was not apparent after 2 doses.

receive a vaccination. We found that 643 individuals tested positive 1 to 21 days before receiving
their vaccination – due to the design and logistics of the survey they might have received their test
results after the date of vaccination – suggesting that ensuring social distancing at vaccination
locations remains important. Rather than representing a biological effect, the reduced risk observed
in the 21 days prior and 0-7 days after vaccination could be due to this reverse causality, specifically
changes in behaviour due to either receiving the vaccination invitation letter, knowledge that
individuals from their age or risk group are about to get vaccinated in their area or postponement of
a planned vaccination visit due to a positive COVID-19 test in the 28 days prior to their scheduled
vaccination appointment. In the hypothetical situation where all infections are detected immediately
and adherence to guidance is perfect, there would be zero new infections observed 1 to 21 days
before vaccination, emphasising the large temporal impact reverse causality can have. In theory, an
unmeasured confounder could also explain the reduction in positive tests 1 to 21 days before
receiving the vaccination compared to >21 days before receiving the vaccination; however, this
would need to be a strong time-varying confounder that is at most weakly associated with calendar
time as the latter was included in the model using a flexible tensor spline that modelled the
interaction between non-linear effects of age and calendar time, and was also allowed to vary by
region/country. Given this, it is much more likely that reverse causality underlies the lower odds of
positive tests before and shortly after vaccination. Because a reduction in contacts and acquisition of
infections in the week before vaccination will also reduce the likelihood of testing positive in the
following week, it will be important for future studies trying to evaluate the effectiveness of
vaccination to carefully construct the appropriate comparator. Here we used study visits from those
that are not vaccinated, not previously positive, ≥21 days before vaccination as the baseline group to
overcome these issues when estimating the impact of vaccination itself.

Our estimated effect of two vaccine doses on symptomatic infections is similar to that in the key
Phase III clinical trials7 8, but slightly higher than other non-randomised studies which have
considered this outcome but focused on specific populations or potentially affected by changes in
test-seeking behaviour associated with vaccination9 15 17 18,19. Higher Ct in infections identified post
vaccination has also been demonstrated in older adults in care homes19. Our estimated reduction in
risk of new PCR-positives for those not vaccinated but infected >4m previously (69%) was slightly
lower than the ~80% (95% CI 75.4 to 84.5%) estimated elsewhere23, but we observed greater
reductions against symptomatic (95%) and Ct<30 (91%) infections, suggesting this could be related to
test seeking behaviour.

Consistent with two recent studies9,14, we found vaccination to be as effective against the B.1.1.7
variant as non-B.1.1.7 variants. Our study supports this in a broader population, including positives
from individuals not reporting symptoms and for the BNT162b2 vaccine in addition to the ChAdOx1
vaccine. Our study had good power to estimate vaccine effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 variant as it
was conducted over the period when B.1.1.7 became dominant in the UK. This is particularly relevant
as the variant has now been detected in over 40 countries worldwide24,25, and the major Phase III
vaccine trials were conducted before this strain was dominant7 8. We observed a slightly greater
reduction in new infection episodes in those vaccinated and aged ≥75 years, compared with those
<75 years – an effect that was no longer apparent after the second dose – potentially due to the
combination of vaccination with reduced social contact in the former group. We currently do not
have evidence of the vaccine being less effective in older individuals as seen elsewhere with natural
re-infections23, although would note that, as described above, vaccine effectiveness also includes a
non-biological behavioural component and there may be compensation for lower biological activity
in older individuals with lower behavioural risk.

There was no evidence of any difference in effectiveness between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines
post first or second doses. However, we cannot exclude the existence of small differences in vaccine
effectiveness due to infrequent infections. There are very few direct head-to-head comparisons of
both vaccines, especially after second doses, and it is important that differences between separate
randomised trials are not directly attributed to the vaccine before considering other differences
between trials, including different outcome definitions, populations, and circulating SARS-CoV-2
variants.7,8

Similar to other studies8 9 16 18, we found greater reductions in new positives after two vaccine doses
compared with one dose, particularly in reducing infections with self-reported symptoms and low
Ct/high viral load. In the UK, the interval between vaccine doses was extended to 12 weeks to
maximise initial coverage and reduce hospitalisations and/or deaths; our findings highlight the
importance for increased protection of individuals getting the second vaccine dose. Nonetheless, the
significant reduction in positivity after only one dose supports the decision to maximise initial
vaccination coverage.

While some infections, particularly those with Ct30, could represent historical infections contracted
prior to vaccination given the timescales and prior negatives post vaccination, some will undoubtedly
reflect new infections after vaccination. Together with other evidence, this suggests that vaccination
does not completely prevent infection following virus exposure, yet minimises progression to more
severe infection15. The fact that vaccinated individuals can still be infected, even if predominantly
with lower viral burden and/or asymptomatic infections, means that onwards transmission remains a
possibility, albeit at lower efficiency26. Overall, approximately one fifth of infections with Ct<30 were
from individuals not reporting symptoms during their episode. These infections could be particularly
relevant for transmission as those individuals may not be aware of their infection status despite
having relatively high viral load. Maintaining measures such a social distancing may therefore still be
needed to control virus spread until enough of the population is vaccinated.

334
335
336
337

We have also shown two vaccine doses to be as effective as prior natural infection. This could be an
important consideration during policy development over COVID-status certification or so-called
COVID passports, and supports considering both prior PCR or serological testing and vaccination data
for this27.

Looking forward, one key question will be whether immunisation offers long-term protection against
COVID-19. A recent study showed the rate of waning and longevity of neutralising antibodies varies
greatly amongst individuals with prior COVID-19 infection and suggested that, if similar rates of
waning are seen after vaccination or new variants that render vaccines less effective emerge and
spread effectively (such as B.1.351 or P.1, which were too rare to assess in our study), more frequent
vaccine administration is likely needed28. Overall, we have shown COVID-19 vaccination to be
effective in reducing the number of new SARS-CoV2 infections, with the greatest benefit received
after two vaccinations, and against symptomatic and high viral burden infections, and no difference
in efftiveness between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) is a large household survey
with longitudinal follow-up (ISRCTN21086382, https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19infection-survey/protocol-and-information-sheets) (details in20). The study received ethical approval
from the South Central Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee (20/SC/0195). Private households are
randomly selected on a continuous basis from address lists and previous surveys to provide a
representative sample across the UK. Following verbal agreement to participate, a study worker
visited each selected household to take written informed consent for individuals aged 2 years and
over. Parents or carers provided consent for those aged 2-15 years; those aged 10-15 years also
provided written assent. All participants who completed the enrolment visit were offered a £50
voucher, and one £25 voucher for each further visit. For the current analysis we only included
individuals aged 16 years and over who were potentially eligible for vaccination.

Individuals were asked about demographics, behaviours, work, and vaccination uptake
(https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey/case-record-forms). At the first visit,
participants were asked for (optional) consent for follow-up visits every week for the next month,
then monthly for 12 months from enrolment. At each visit, enrolled household members provided a
nose and throat self-swab following instructions from the study worker, which is comparable to or
even more sensitive than swabs done by healthcare workers29. From a random 10-20% of
households, those 16 years or older were invited to provide blood monthly for antibody testing.

Swabs were couriered directly to the UK’s national Lighthouse laboratories (Glasgow and the
National Biocentre in Milton Keynes (to 8 February 2021)) where samples were tested within the
national testing programme using identical methodology. The presence of three SARS-CoV-2 genes
(ORF1ab, nucleocapsid protein (N), and spike protein (S)) was identified using real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), analysed using UgenTec Fast Finder 3.300.5 (TagMan 2019-nCoV assay kit V2 UK NHS ABI
7500 v2.1; UgenTec, Hasselt, Belgium). The assay plugin contains an assay-specific algorithm and
decision mechanism that allows conversion of the qualitative amplification assay raw data into test
results with little manual intervention. Samples are called positive if either N or ORF1ab, or both, are
detected. The S gene alone is not considered a reliable positive29, but could accompany other genes
(ie, one, two, or three gene positives).

Blood samples were couriered directly to the University of Oxford, where they were tested for the
SARS-CoV-2 antibody using an ELISA detecting anti-trimeric spike IgG30. Before 26 February 2021, the
assay used fluorescence detection as previously described (positivity threshold 8 million units)3. After
this, it used a commercialised CE-marked version of the assay, the Thermo Fisher OmniPATH 384
Combi SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), with the same antigen
and a colorimetric detection system (positivity threshold 42 ng/ml monoclonal antibody unit
equivalents, determined from 3840 samples run in parallel).

564

This analysis included participants aged 16 years or over (i.e. those who theoretically could have
received vaccination), and all visits with positive or negative swab results from 1 December 2020 to 8
May 2021.

Participants were asked about their vaccination status at visits, including type, number of doses and
date(s). Participants from England were also linked to administrative records from the National
Immunisation Management Service (NIMS). We used records from NIMS where available, otherwise
records from the survey, since linkage was periodic and NIMS does not contain information about
vaccinations received abroad or in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Where records were
available in both, agreement on type was 98% and on dates 95% within ±7 days. The main analysis
included any type of COVID vaccination, but there were only sufficient numbers to provide separate
estimates for ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 in analyses that evaluated results by vaccine type, so other
vaccines were excluded from these analyses.

PCR-positive results may be obtained at multiple visits after infection, so we grouped positive tests
into ‘episodes’. Whole genome sequencing is available on only a subset of positives, and only a
subsample provide monthly blood samples for antibody status, so positive episodes were defined
using study PCR results. Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of re-infection as
positive tests occurring at least 90 days after the onset of primary infection31, but also incorporating
multiple consecutive negative tests, we defined the start of a new ‘infection episode’ as the date of
either: i) the first PCR-positive test in the study (not preceded by any study PCR-positive test by
definition); ii) a PCR-positive test after 4 or more consecutive negative tests; or iii) a PCR-positive test
at least 90 days after the start of a previous infection episode with one or more negative tests
immediately preceding this. Positive episodes were used to classify exposure groups and outcomes
(see below).

587

Exposures

588
589

At each study visit, a participant was classified into one of eight different exposure groups based on
current vaccination status, study antibody and PCR tests, and (for exposure classification only)
positive swab tests linked from the English national testing programme32 (prior to visit), as follows:

We chose these vaccination status categories empirically based on the odds of infection episodes
when modelling days since first vaccination as a continuous effect, allowing for non-linearity by using
restricted cubic splines (Extended Data Fig. 1). Exposure group ii (Not vaccinated, not previously
positive, 1-21 days before vaccination) was included because there is likely a certain degree of
transient reverse causality where individuals are avoiding contact with others prior vaccination and
vaccination appointments have to be rescheduled if someone test positive in the weeks before the
scheduled visit (21-day cut-off reflecting the period where odds dropped below 0.50 based on
Extended Data Fig. 1). Visits from participants that were not vaccinated, previously positive were
further split by whether the first evidence of the positive test was <4 months ago or longer, because,
as not everyone underwent antibody testing, by necessity our definition of a new positive episode
was based on PCR positives only. More positive tests due to intermittent prolonged carriage might be
expected for visits with a more recent time since the index positive episode, despite the fact that
individuals were considered at risk again for a new positive episode only after having at least 4 or
more consecutive negative tests or at least 90 days since the start of the index positive with at least
one negative study result before the new episode. The 4 month cut-off was arbitrary being
approximately the median time since the first evidence of positivity (median 125 days). As antibody
status before vaccination is not available for all participants, we defined prior positivity by having
either a positive antibody measurement >90 days before the visit or a previous PCR-positive episode.
The choice of 90 days was arbitrary, but designed to exclude ongoing infections acquired previously
being misattributed to current visits. Visits from vaccinated individuals (groups (iii)-(vi)) were defined
irrespective of previous positivity (Supplementary Table 2 & 4) to reflect the impact of vaccination as
being implemented in the UK (without regard to prior infection). Visits from the same participant
were classified in different groups depending on their status at each visit.

Analysis was based on visits, since these occur independently of symptoms and are therefore
unbiased. Only the first test-positive visit in the first new positive infection episode starting after 1
December was used, dropping all subsequent visits in the same infection episode and all negative
visits before the first time a participant could be considered “at risk” for a new positive episode (as
defined above), to avoid misattributing ongoing PCR-positivity to visit characteristics and immortal
time bias respectively. Primary analysis included all first new positive infection episodes. Secondary
analyses considered infection severity, by classifying positives by cycle threshold (Ct) value (<30 or
≥30) and self-reported symptoms. The threshold Ct value of 30 is somewhat arbitrary, but
corresponds to ~150 copies/ml,26 and is consistently used in the UK for many purposes, including
algorithms for review of low level positives at the Lighthouse Laboratories where the PCR tests were
performed and a threshold for attempting whole genome sequencing. For each positive test, a single
Ct was calculated as the arithmetic mean across detected genes (Spearman correlation>0.98), then
the minimum value was taken across positives in the infection episode to reflect the greatest
measured viral burden within an episode. To allow for pre-symptomatic positives being identified in
the survey, any self-reported symptoms at any visit within 0 to 35 days after the index positive in
each infection episode were included (questions elicit symptoms in the last 7 days at each visit).
Finally, positive infection episodes were classified as compatible with the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant
(those positive at least once for ORF1ab+N across the episode and never S-positive) and those that
were incompatible (ORF1ab+N+S or ORF1ab+S or N+S at least once across the episode). B.1.1.7 has
deletions in the S gene leading to S gene target failure, and ORF1ab+N positivity only remains a good
proxy for B.1.1.7 from whole-genome sequencing from mid November 202033. Positives where only a
single N or single ORF1ab gene were detected were excluded from this secondary analysis.

The following potential confounders were adjusted for in all models as potential risk factors for
acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection: geographic area and age in years (see below), sex, ethnicity (white vs
non-white as small numbers), index of multiple deprivation (percentile, calculated separately for
each country in the UK)34-37, working in a care-home, having a patient-facing role in health or social
care, presence of long-term health conditions, household size, multigenerational household, ruralurban classification38-40, direct or indirect contact with a hospital or care-home, smoking status, mode
of travel to work, work location, and visit frequency. Details are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

Associations between the different exposure groups and outcome (first positive test in an infection
episode vs test-negative) were evaluated with generalised linear models with a logit link. Robust
standard errors were used to account for multiple visits per-participant. To adjust for substantial
confounding by calendar time and age, with non-linear effects of age which are also different by
region, we included both as restricted cubic splines with knots at the 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%
percentiles of unique values and interactions between these splines and region/country (regions for
England and country for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). Furthermore, given previous
observations of different positivity rates by age over time20, we added a tensor spline to model the
interaction between age and calendar time with the restriction that the interaction is not doubly
non-linear41. We considered effect modification by age of vaccination by fitting this same model, but
also including an interaction between vaccine exposure group and age <75 vs ≥75 years, or long-term
health conditions. There were no positives in those aged ≥75 years in one previously infected
exposure group, so these groups were excluded from subgroup analysis by age. Pairwise
comparisons of the exposure groups were performed using Tukey adjustments for the pairwise
comparisons. Analysis was based on complete cases (>99% observations) (Supplementary Table 2).
