ABSTRACT

Objective

To establish the prevalence and risk factors for the development of suspected or confirmed coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK).
Design

Cross-sectional observational study.
Setting

UK-based primary and secondary care.
Participants

HCWs aged ≥18 years working between 1 February and 25 May 2020.
Main outcome measures

A composite endpoint of laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, or self-isolation or
hospitalisation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
Results

Of 6152 eligible responses, the composite endpoint was present in 1806 (29.4%) HCWs, of whom 49
(0.8%) were hospitalised, 459 (7.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 1776 (28.9%) reported selfisolation. The strongest risk factor associated with the presence of the primary composite endpoint was
increasing frequency of contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases without adequate personal
protective equipment (PPE): “Never” (reference), “Rarely” (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, (95% confidence
interval: 0.87 to 1.29)), “Sometimes” (1.7 (1.37 to 2.10)), “Often” (1.84 (1.28 to 2.63)), “Always” (2.93,
(1.75 to 5.06)). Additionally, several comorbidities (cancer, respiratory disease, and obesity); working in
a ‘doctors’ role; using public transportation for work; regular contact with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 patients; and lack of PPE were also associated with the presence of the primary endpoint.
1382 (22.5%) HCWs reported lacking access to PPE items while having clinical contact with suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 cases. Overall, between 11,870 and 21,158 days of self-isolation were required by
the cohort, equalling approximately 71 to 127 working days lost per 1000 working days.
Conclusions

Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was more common in HCWs than in the general population. Risk
factors included inadequate PPE, which was reported by nearly a quarter of HCWs. Governments and
policymakers must ensure adequate PPE is available as well as developing strategies to mitigate risk for
high-risk HCWs during future COVID-19 waves.

INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis that has challenged healthcare systems around the
world. As of 09 August 2020, there were over 19 million confirmed cases and at least 721,000 deaths
worldwide.1 Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been identified to be at risk of nosocomial COVID-19
infection.2–6 In the United States (US), over 124,000 HCWs have been infected with COVID-19,7 and up to
16% of those infected in the UK were thought to be key workers, a category that includes both HCWs as
well as other essential workers from other industries.8

The prevalence of COVID-19 in HCWs is thought to be higher than in the general population due to
exposure to higher viral loads from increased contact with infected individuals.5,9,10 The prevalence of
COVID-19 amongst HCWs is variable with limited data comparing different staff roles and workplace
environments (i.e. secondary versus primary care).11–15 Recent reports of HCW deaths have also revealed
that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups appear to represent a greater proportion of these
deaths.3,4 The reasons for this preponderance of BAME groups and COVID-19 severity in HCWs as well as
the general population are likely to be complex and multifactorial.18 Similarly, HCW-related mortality
from COVID-19 in the UK is reported as one of the highest globally, yet the reasons for this are poorly
understood.16

Due to the nature of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, HCWs exposed to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs)
are at potentially higher risk of developing COVID-19.5,17,18 However, what constitutes an AGP remains
contentious, with conflicting international and national guidance.19,20 Furthermore, shortages of
personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the pandemic and beyond remains a concern for

HCWs.21,22 Taken together, the workplace environmental risks for HCWs with different exposures to
COVID-19 and access to PPE remain unclear.

We therefore designed a UK-wide cross-sectional study to understand the prevalence and possible risk
factors for the reporting of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection amongst HCWs. We aimed to
capture details on socio-demographics, occupational exposure, and use of PPE to help expand the
evidence base for HCWs and policymakers.

METHODS

We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of UK-based HCWs between 4–25 May 2020 in
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. We included all HCWs aged 18 years or above and
working at any time since 1 February 2020. Healthcare workers practicing in both primary (community
and social care facilities) as well as secondary (hospitals) care were eligible. The study was prospectively
registered as a service evaluation project at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (Service
Evaluation ID: 10834) and was deemed to not require ethical approval by the Research and
Development Department and the Health Research Authority Decision Tool.

Study design

We designed an online survey using Knack (Evenly Odd Inc., Philadelphia, USA), an online data capture
and database system. A multi-phased process involving several authors (JK, RP, KE, IA, DW, CM) was
used to construct, revise and ratify the final survey. An initial draft of questions for the survey was
created by JK and RP and sent to the remaining authors for review. Based on feedback received,
modifications were made and questions compiled, followed by a second round of review and testing by
all authors on the online system. This version of the survey was piloted in a convenience sample of 93
participants. One change was made as a consequence: an expanded list of specialties was implemented.

The final survey comprised 33 closed questions and five free-text entries, divided into five sections: (1)
participant characteristics; (2) work details; (3) self-isolation and COVID-19 status; (4) workplace
exposure characteristics; and (5) PPE (supplementary material). Free-text entries were used for gender
identity (if not the same as sex at birth), ethnic background (if not within one of the listed groups),
number of days of self-isolation (if greater than 14 days, with conditional limits) and an ‘Other

Comments’ question. The survey covered experiences from the period 1 February 2020 to the date
when each HCW participated in the study.

Survey administration

The survey was disseminated electronically using a web link which directed potential participants to the
survey form. This web link was shared on several relevant social media platforms and via e-mail. We
engaged several organisations and Royal Colleges to assist with dissemination to their respective
membership (a list of endorsing organisations is reported in the supplementary material).

Definitions

Several survey response variables were grouped a priori to facilitate analyses. We defined a collective
‘BAME’ ethnic group as those participants who identified as ‘Asian or Asian British’, ‘Black, African, Black
British or Caribbean’, ‘Mixed or multiple ethnic groups’, and ‘another ethnic , in keeping with
contemporary reporting.3,23,24 Occupational roles were grouped into five subgroups: (1) Doctors - all
doctors; (2) Dentists and dental staff - dentist, dental nurse, and dental hygienist; (3) Nurses, midwives
and associated staff - healthcare assistant, maternity care worker, midwife, nurse, and nursing
associate; (4) Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) - dietician, healthcare scientist (e.g. lab-based),
occupational therapist, operating department practitioner, optician, paramedic, pharmacist,
phlebotomist, physician associate, physiotherapist, psychologist, radiographer, speech and language
therapist, technician (clinical), and therapist (Other); and (5) Other - administrative staff, domestic
services, manager (care home), ‘other’, porter, senior carer (care home), support worker/assistant, and
wellbeing/activity coordinator (care home). In line with Public Health England (PHE) guidance,20 higher
risk areas were considered to be the following: COVID-19 pod/bay/ward, day case surgery unit,

emergency department (ED), endoscopy unit (upper respiratory, ENT or upper GI endoscopy), intensive
care (ICU)/High dependency unit (HDU), and operating theatre.

We originally included an option for “Intersex” when enquiring about sex and gender identity to support
inclusivity based on published guidance.23–25 However, during the study, several HCWs and members of
the public expressed concern regarding this approach, leading to a removal of the option for “Intersex”,
leaving only “Male” and “Female” as options for sexual identity.

The primary endpoint of this study was a composite outcome of any of the following: (1) self-isolation
due to COVID-19 symptoms or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, (2) hospitalisation with suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 and (3) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (via reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction or antibody testing).

Data analysis

We report our findings according to STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) guidance (supplementary material).25

Statistical analyses were conducted in R Version 4.0.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). Continuous data are reported using mean (standard deviation, SD) or median
(interquartile ranges, IQR) where appropriate for measures of central tendency and spread. Categorical
data are reported as numbers (percentages, %). A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Relationships between categorical variables and outcome measures are presented as univariate odds
ratios with accompanying p-values (Pearson’s Chi-square test with Yates’ continuity correction). A
planned analysis of free-text entries in “Other Comments” will be reported in a separate paper.

To identify risk factors for COVID-19 amongst HCWs, we modelled the association between covariates
chosen a priori and the COVID-19 composite endpoint using univariable and multivariable logistic
regression modelling. As questions on comorbidities and tobacco smoking were optional in the survey,
those participants who did not answer these questions were identified as “Prefer not to say”. For those
participants who answered “No” to regular clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases
without adequate PPE, they were regarded as having a frequency of “None” for clinical contact without
adequate PPE. Findings from the regression analysis are reported as adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI) and accompanying p-values. Quality of the final model was assessed by the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).
Two further subgroup analyses were conducted in participants who had regular clinical contact with
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients and in those who had regular exposure to AGPs conducted in
suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Code for all analyses is available on request.

Patient and Public Involvement

As the survey was designed by HCWs, and the target population was HCWs, patient and public
involvement was not sought.

Work details

A total of 5518 participants were HCWs based in England (89.7%), followed by 321 (5.2%) in Scotland,
213 (3.5%) in Wales and 100 (1.6%) in Northern Ireland. Based on region, 1770 (28.8%) responses were
received from Greater London, with all other regions contributing less 5.5% each. Figure 2 shows
responses stratified by main healthcare facility. Healthcare worker roles were grouped into doctors
(1770 (28.8%)), nurses, midwives and associated staff (2516 (40.9%)), dentists and dental staff (198
(3.2%)), AHPs (1118 (18.2%)), and Other (550 (8.9%)). eTables 1 to 4 summarises responses into HCW
roles and grades (supplementary material).

A total of 3902 (63.4%) HCWs reported regular clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
patients. Of all participants, 2296 (37.3%) responded as having had regular exposure to AGPs performed
in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Data for areas of clinical contact and the AGPs that
participants were exposed to are summarised in eFigure 1 and eFigure2, respectively (supplementary
material).

COVID-19 status

A total of 1776 participants (28.9%) self-isolated because of COVID-19 symptoms (eFigure 3,
supplementary material) or testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those who self-isolated, 840 (47.3%)

self-isolated for 1–7 days, 708 (39.9%) for 8–14 days, and 228 (12.8%) for more than 14 days. The total
number of days of self-isolation in this cohort was between 11,870 and 21,158 days. The mean (SD)
duration of self-isolation for participants who self-isolated for more than 14 days was 23.4 (8.8) days. In

addition, 228 participants (12.8%) self-isolated more than once. Forty-nine (0.8%) participants were
hospitalised for suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Responses for testing for SARS-CoV-2 revealed a total
of 1407 (22.9%) participants who were tested during the period covered by the survey: 948 (15.4%) had
never tested positive or were awaiting test results, 20 (0.3%) were positive on blood testing and 439
(7.1%) were positive on oral/nasal swab testing.

Personal Protective Equipment

With regards to PPE, 4334 (70.4%) participants answered that they had received sufficient training in the
use of PPE. Throughout the timeframe of interest, 1382 (22.5%) participants had been in a situation
where they lacked access to items of PPE when having clinical contact with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 patients. Figure 3 summarises the PPE items that participants reported lack of access to under
these situations. Furthermore, 1306 (21.2%) participants had been in clinical contact with suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 patients without adequate PPE. The top three reasons for these encounters
without adequate PPE were ‘Patient not suspected/confirmed’, ‘Lack of PPE availability’, and ‘Senior
instruction’ (summarised in eFigure 4 of supplementary material).

Univariable and multivariable modelling against the COVID-19 composite

The results from univariable and multivariable analyses of covariates from the survey and the presence

No difference in the presence of the COVID-19 composite endpoint was seen between different ethnic
groups. This persisted with constituent ethnic groups replacing the collective BAME group: Asian or
Asian British (adjusted OR 0.96 (0.81 – 1.14), p-value = 0.643), Black, African, Black British or Caribbean
(adjusted OR 1.03 (0.79 – 1.33), p-value = 0.845), Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups (adjusted OR 0.99
(0.69 – 1.40), p-value = 0.937), and Another ethnic group (adjusted OR 0.96 (0.67 – 1.36), p-value =
0.828) (eTable 6, supplementary material).

Being a current or ex-smoker (within 1 year) was associated with a significant decrease in odds for the
COVID-19 composite endpoint compared to participants who never smoked. To assess if this effect was
due to collider bias following adjustments for comorbidities in our model, an additional model was
constructed with comorbidities removed (eTable 7, supplementary material). However, in this model,
being a current or ex-smoker (within 1 year) still had reduced odds for the presence of the composite
endpoint (adjusted OR 0.79 (0.64 – 0.98), p-value = 0.034).

In a subgroup analysis of those who had regular clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
patients (3902 (63%)), participants working in higher risk areas as defined by PHE15 made up 81.7% of

this subgroup. Working in an inpatient clinic area was associated with a significant increased risk of
reporting the primary endpoint (adjusted OR 1.41 (1.01 – 1.97), p = 0.043). The following areas were
associated with a significant decreased risk: home visits (adjusted OR 0.68 (0.47 – 0.98), p = 0.040),
ICU/HDU (adjusted OR 0.78 (0.65 – 0.94), p = 0.007), operating theatre (adjusted OR 0.71 (0.57 – 0.87), p
= 0.001), radiology (adjusted OR 0.62 (0.42 – 0.91), p = 0.016) and other areas (adjusted OR 0.69 (0.48 –
0.98), p = 0.044). eTable 8 (supplementary material) summarises the model for this subgroup analysis.

In terms of exposure to AGPs, a separate subgroup analysis of participants who had been regularly
exposed to AGPs used in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (2296 (37.3%)) showed that 95.8%
of this cohort were exposed to procedures considered by PHE to be AGPs18 (i.e. this excludes ‘CPR’,
‘nebulisers’ and ‘other’ as AGPs during the study period). In this subgroup, no particular AGP was
associated with a significant change in risk on multivariate analysis (eTable 9, supplementary material).

DISCUSSION

Principal Findings

We describe the characteristics of a sample of UK-based HCWs working during the COVID-19 pandemic
and relate their experiences to the development of COVID-19 infection-related outcomes. The overall
prevalence of the primary composite endpoint amongst HCWs was 29.4% over the period from 1st
February to 25th May 2020. A number of risk factors were explored using regression modelling of the
survey responses. Additionally, we report a substantial number of working days lost from self-isolation
due to symptoms and estimate between 11,800 and 21,100 working days lost during the study period,
translating to between 71 to 127 working days lost per 1000 working days (assuming a 40-hour work
week per HCW). We also report that 22.5% of participants had encountered a situation where they
lacked PPE items and identified a variety of PPE items that were not available.

Comparison with other studies

The prevalence of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 amongst HCWs is higher in our sampled population
compared to other sources.5,6,11–13 Previous estimates have ranged from as low as 1.73% through a
population survey-based approach11 to as high as between 7.7 – 18% via testing of healthcare staff.6,12,13
A study amongst HCWs involved in tracheal intubation using a similar primary endpoint reported an
overall incidence of 10.7% over a median follow-up period of 32 days.5 The use of a composite endpoint
facilitated capture of outcomes from individuals who were plausibly at risk of testing positive for SARSCoV-2, but who were never tested. Indeed, 77.2% of our total sampled population (n = 4745) had never
been tested. During the time period, HCWs had to self-isolate based on clinical symptoms alone due to
lack of mass testing.26 Drawing definitive prevalence conclusions from the data reported herein is
challenging due to the self-reported nature of study conduct, but the magnitude of the reported
prevalence cannot be ignored.

Our data did not suggest any difference between White and BAME groups within the HCW population
for developing the COVID-19 composite endpoint, after adjusting for comorbidities (including obesity).
However, amongst the hospitalised group, there was a higher proportion of BAME HCWs compared with
the total sampled population (40.8% vs. 23.7%), particularly ‘Asian or Asian British’, and ‘Black, African,
Black British or Caribbean’. Increased focus on the BAME community has resulted from findings of more
severe COVID-19 infection amongst individuals of BAME origin.3,4,23 PHE have previously reported on the
disparities in risks and outcomes for COVID-19 infection, identifying a higher prevalence of positive tests
for SARS-CoV-2 and more severe disease amongst BAME groups within the UK, though the effects of
occupation and comorbidities (including obesity) were unaccounted for.27,28 Thus, despite similar
susceptibilities to the disease, it remains the case that HCWs from BAME origins may be at risk of more
severe disease and death.

Adequate training and correct use of PPE (particularly during donning and doffing) are important in
reducing the risk of transmission of respiratory infectious disease from patient to HCWs18,29,30 and this
was reflected in our results. This may also explain our finding that HCWs exposed to regular AGPs in
suspected or confirmed COVD-19 patients were less likely to have the presence of the primary endpoint.
Given the importance of PPE use to protect against viral transmission,29,31,32 it is unsurprising that
participants who lacked access to PPE items, and those who were more frequently exposed to suspected
or confirmed cases of COVID-19 without adequate PPE had a higher risk of the presence of the COVID-19
composite endpoint. That nearly a quarter of UK HCWs reported being in such a situation is notable.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of our study include a relatively large sample size and the inclusion of HCWs from all
backgrounds and work environments to facilitate risk comparisons using a standardised survey. We
captured granular information that has otherwise been poorly reported in prevalence studies in HCWs.
For example, medical history and details regarding the use, or lack thereof, of PPE have not been
elsewhere reported. We did not limit our recruitment to primary or secondary care, and thus the
associations we report are generalisable across a wide range of healthcare settings.

Several limitations need to be addressed. First, data were gathered using a survey-based approach
which risks selection and recall bias. We also could not capture data from HCWs who died from COVID19 infection, or those who were too ill to respond. However, our methodology allowed us to rapidly
capture both objective and subjective granular data from a large number of participants. Second, we
were unable to determine a denominator to quantify a response rate for this observational study. Third,
the use of a composite outcome to detect suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection in HCWs may
have resulted in an overestimation of prevalence. However, this definition is in keeping with that used in
other studies5 and internationally.7 Availability of testing for HCWs was also limited during early phases
of the pandemic, thus clinical diagnoses were often relied upon. On the other hand, data have estimated
that 7% of HCWs are asymptomatic seroconverters,11,33 and thus our data could potentially represent an
underestimation of COVID-19 transmission. Fourth, we sought some subjective data, although this was a
pragmatic decision to maximise detail in responses. Fifth, several changes to national guidance and
policies were made throughout the study period15,37 which may confound responses regarding PPE.
Finally, all data herein are subjective and represent hypothesis-generating associations in the
responding participants. Objective analyses are required to determine the findings we reported.

19
Conclusions and Implications

We found a reported prevalence estimate of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection of nearly a
third, based on a COVID-19 composite endpoint, amongst HCWs within the UK. We also present several
risk factors associated with reporting of this endpoint, lack of PPE being an important consideration. As
a consequence of self-isolation, between 11,000 to 21,000 days of clinical service was lost. In future,
important considerations for policymakers are to ensure adequate PPE supplies to all HCWs in
preparation for a potential surge in COVID-19 cases and accessible, rapid, accurate testing strategies to
enable improved healthcare workforce planning.
