Abstract
Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak rapidly evolved into a pandemic, there is an urgent
need for rapid development, identification and confirmation of efficacious antiviral
prophylaxis. In this setting, the existing drugs chloroquine (CQ) and
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which has suggestive evidence of efficacy against SARSCoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease has become prime candidates to be
repositioned as therapeutic and preventative agents, and a growing number of clinical
trials have been registered to study their preventative potential for at-risk populations
using a range of dosing schemes and outcome measures. This rapid systematic review
protocol aims to provide streamlined and timely synthesis on methodologies and
results of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in hopes
that this will constructively inform further research as well as public health policy.

BACKGROUND
Since its reported outbreak in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 virus causing corona virus
2019 (COVID-19) disease has exploded from a few people suffering a respiratory
disease to a pandemic of over a million cases. Current methods of infection control is
largely confined to public and personal health measures, while vaccine development
maybe as much as 18 months away from deployment (Higgins-Dunn, 2020).
Besides vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis is the other major pharmaceutical
intervention that can be effective. Antivirals are potentially prophylactic and has been
successfully applied pre- and post-exposure against viral infections (De Clercq, 2013).
In the case of COVID-19, the repositioning the old anti-malarial chloroquine (CQ)
and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has received much attention as they
have in-vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al., 2020) and have some
preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy against COVID-19 (Gao et al., 2020; Gautret
et al., 2020). The two agents have thus been proposed as potential prophylaxis against
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 (Chang & Sun, 2020; Nicola & Esposito, 2020) but
they are nevertheless untested in the prophylaxis setting, and multiple trials targeting
different populations with a total proposed enrolment of over a hundred thousand
subjects world-wide using a range of doses as well as outcomes have already been
registered to date.
Notwithstanding a living systematic review protocol has been proposed to
assess clinical trials for COVID-19 (Maguire & Guérin, 2020), and published
systematic reviews evaluating CQ and HCQ's role as treatment for COVID-19
(Kapoor & Kapoor, 2020) or assessing clinical trials using CQ and HCQ as treatment
while specifically excluding prevention studies (Rana & Dulal, 2020), there is as yet
no protocol for systematically assessing clinical trials that address the preventative

efficacy of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and we aim to fulfil
the gap.
As a choice of review methodology, we decided on a rapid systematic review
because a traditional systematic review with its concomitant rigours of methodology
can take up to two years to conduct which may be inordinately long to be informative
to researchers and policy makers in the face of a rapidly evolving pandemic. Whereas
rapid reviews would be a streamlined form of knowledge synthesis geared to be
informative in a timely manner (Khangura et al., 2012), and would be more suitable to
the subject and context of this review.

METHODS
Protocol and registration
This manuscript complies with the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews
and Meta-Analyses’ (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and metaanalyses (Shamseer et al., 2015) and the protocol for this systematic review was
registered on INPLASY (https://doi.org/10.37766/inplasy2020.4.0101).

Review Questions
There are primary, secondary and tertiary questions to be addressed by this review:
I. Primary
a) Does prophylactic CQ or HCQ reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection?
b) Does prophylactic CQ or HCQ reduce the severity of COVID-19 in those
subsequently infected, as measured by range or symptoms and laboratory or
radiologic abnormalities, need or duration of hospitalization and ICU stay, and
subsequent mortality?

II. Secondary:
a) What are the comparative efficacies of various dosage regimen (choice of CQ
versus HCQ, dose strength and duration of treatment) for prophylactic CQ or HCQ in
specific at risk populations against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?
b) What is the compliance rate and what are the adverse effects of prophylactic CQ or
HCQ at various dose strengths and treatment durations?
III. Tertiary:
a) What is the quality of the preventative trials assessing CQ and HCQ as prophylaxis
against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19?
b) How could such trials be optimized to allow better future assessment of the
intervention outcomes?
c) How can the results of such trials potentially inform health policy in the pandemic?

Search method and selection procedure
The main search resources will be 23 national, regional and international clinical trial
registries including the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (Table 1).
The search period will be up to the present date of the search. The following search
terms will be used: ("covid-19" OR "covid 19" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "n-cov" OR
"sars-cov-2" OR "sars-cov2" OR "2019-ncov" OR "SARS-Coronavirus-2" OR
"SARS-Coronavirus2") AND (“chloroquine” OR “hydroxychloroquine”). We will
eliminate any duplicates records from different registries and record the reasons for
exclusion of trials at various stages of the search as well as outline the selection
process in a PRISMA flow diagram. For all included trials, the source clinical trial
registry database will be searched and the related trial record identified in order to
supplement data extraction. Additional corroborative searches will be executed using

Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Embase,
and without any language or publication status restrictions. The Infectious Diseases
Data Observatory (IDDO) website which documents clinical trial registrations related
to COVID-19 (Maguire & Guérin, 2020) will also be consulted . In order to identify
articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we will a) scan the
reference bibliographies of other pertinent systematic reviews on the search terms,
and evaluate in full text all the articles they include, b) scan the reference lists of
selected narrative reviews and other documents relevant to the subject, c) conduct
cross-citation search in Google Scholar, as well as review relevant news websites in
English and Chinese for any newly announced or unregistered trials. Grey literature
searching will also be conducted for technical or research reports of planned, active or
completed clinical trials from industry, international and government agencies, and
scientific research groups.

Eligibility criteria
Study eligibility criteria for this systematic review and meta-analysis will be assessed
in accordance with established Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes
and Study designs (PICOS) descriptions (Guyatt et al., 2011):
I) Participants
This will include healthy but at-risk subjects who otherwise are without contraindications to participate, as defined by the authors of the trials. Studies including
subjects already infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be excluded.
II) Interventions
The interventions are the preventative use of CQ or HCQ alone or in combination

with other prophylactic agents. We will not restrict our criteria to any dosage,
duration, timing or route of administration.
III) Comparisons
The comparison will be placebo or other agents chosen by authors (CQ or HCQ with
or without other prophylactic agent versus placebo and other same prophylactic agent)
or no treatment (CQ or HCQ versus observation). Trials assessing CQ or HCQ plus
other agents will be eligible if co-interventions are identical in both intervention and
comparison groups.
IV) Outcomes
We will not use outcomes as an exclusion criteria during the selection process, but
will include all outcomes included by authors of the trials grouped under primary or
secondary outcomes. Examples of primary outcomes include seroconversion,
incidence and prevalence of subsequent clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation
of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease, subsequent severity of COVID-19
disease, hospitalization rate, ICU admission rate, death rate and loss of work-hours (or
number of sick days) in those newly infected after intervention is undertaken.
Examples of secondary outcomes include side-effects of active intervention and
compliancy rates. Such primary and secondary outcomes can be presented in a
‘Summary of Findings’ table, and a table with all the outcomes can be presented in an
appendix.
V) Study Design
Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) will be included.

Data extraction

Using standardised forms, two researchers will independently extract data on study
design, setting, participant characteristics, intervention and comparison details
including dosage, duration, timing and route of administration, outcomes assessed and
time of measure, as well as funding source or conflicts of interests as reported by
authors of the trials. In the case of the need for further clarification on trial details, we
will directly contact the principle investigators of the trials. We will resolve
disagreements by discussion, and an independent arbiter will adjudicate any
unresolved disagreements.

Quality and risk of bias assessment
Two researchers will independently assess risk of bias for each RCT study using the
Jadad scale (Oxford Quality Scoring System)(Clark et al., 1999). This is composed of
five points in total; two for randomization, two for blinding, and one for the drop out
rate, and gives an output in reference to the quality of the trial. In case of discrepancy
between the two researchers, a third party will be asked to apply the scale to
independently address the discrepancy. Additionally, researchers intend to
qualitatively summarize the risk of bias across different studies for each of six
domains: (1) random sequence generation (2) allocation concealment (3) blinding
methods (4) incomplete outcome data (5) selective outcome reporting (6) other biases,
as referenced by the Cochrane collaboration network (Higgins et al., 2011).

Data synthesis and statistical analysis
If there are more than one trial and they are clinically homogeneous, we will conduct
meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, 2014), using the inverse
variance method with random effects model. For any outcomes where data was

insufficient to calculate an effect estimate, a narrative synthesis will be employed. For
binary outcomes, we will summarize using risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI. For
continuous outcomes, we will use mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD)
to summarise the data using a 95% CI. The Mantel-Haenszel method (Suesse & Liu,
2019) will be used to pool effect estimates of binary outcomes and inverse variance
for continuous outcomes. Cochrane Q test will be used to assess heterogeneity
between studies (Higgins et al., 2003), and I2 testing will be done to quantify
heterogeneity between studies (Higgins & Thompson, 2002), with values > 50%
representing moderate-to-high heterogeneity. Either a random or fixed-effect model
will be used to pool the data depending on the level of heterogeneity detected and the
number of studies involved. Subgroup analysis will also be performed to identify
possible causes of significant heterogeneity between studies. In case we identify
significant differences between subgroups (test for interaction <0.05), we will report
these results separately. If there are at least 10 trials available to be included in this
study, we will conduct funnel plot and Egger test to check for reporting bias (Sterne et
al., 2011)

Dissemination of information
The current protocol will be revised periodically and adapted as necessary in
accordance with updated RCTs assessing CQ and HCQ prevention in the changing
context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and updates will be accessible online via the
Inplasy registry. Results of the baseline review as well as updates will be published in
as preprint and submitted to an open source, peer-reviewed journal.
