Abstract

22

As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, it is increasingly important to under-

23

stand the factors that influence its transmission. Seasonal variation driven by responses

24

to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several

25

coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on SARS-CoV-2 remains largely

26

unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of

27

SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of

28

temperature, humidity, UV radiation, and population density with estimates of trans-

29

mission rate (R). Using data from the United States of America, we explore correlates

30

of transmission across USA states using comparative regression and integrative epidemi-

31

ological modelling. We find that policy intervention (‘lockdown’) and reductions in indi-

32

viduals’ mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but in their

33

absence lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased

34

SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered

35

a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may

36

lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or

37

behavioural changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of

38

COVID-19, its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.

Introduction

40

In late 2019 a novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan City (Hubei, China) 1 began to

41

rapidly spread through the human population. Since March 2020 this disease, COVID-

42

19, has been recognised as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation 2 . The

43

causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a close relative of the 2003 SARS coronavirus 1 , although

44

it appears to have several differences including a higher basic reproduction number 3

45

(R0 ; the average number of people infected by a carrier at the onset of an epidemic).

46

Understanding the factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 transmission is key for understanding

47

the current patterns of transmission and for refining predictions of the future spread of

48

SARS-CoV-2. Other coronaviruses display seasonal cycles of transmission and up to 30%

49

of seasonal ‘colds’ are caused by coronaviruses 4 . Thus, as many Northern-hemisphere

50

countries relax the non-pharmaceutical interventions initially imposed to control COVID-

51

19, there is a pressing need to understand whether seasonality will enhance or drive a

52

‘second wave’ of COVID-19 outbreaks as they move into autumn or winter 5 .

53

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus which is structurally (if not phylogenetically)

54

similar to other RNA viruses such as influenza, MERS, and HcoV-NL63 6 , that are known

55

to display seasonal dynamics due to their physical properties. For example, high temper-

56

atures and low humidity can have a negative effect on influenza transmission by reducing

57

the efficiency of respiratory droplet transmission 7,8 . Similar effects are seen in transmis-

58

sion of coronaviruses 9–11 , where high environmental temperatures break down viral lipid

59

layers to inactivate virus particles that are in the air or deposited on surfaces 10,12 . How-

60

ever, assessing the role of environment during a disease outbreak is challenging 13 because

61

human factors such as population density, herd immunity, and behaviour are likely the

62

main drivers of transmission 14–16 . Moreover, the non-pharmaceutical control measures

63

and behavioural changes in response to COVID-19 have been unprecedented in the mod-

64

ern era. These difficulties have hindered the quantification of the impact of environment

65

on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, making it harder to generalise and synthesise observations

66

across regions with their differing climates. Despite these caveats, various early studies

67

have already reported effects of environmental variables such as temperature, humidity,

68

UV levels, and wind-speed on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 17–24 . While, in general,

69

most studies appear to support increased transmission rates under cool, dry conditions 18 ,

70

conflicting results have been observed 21,25 and collectively the environmental signal ap-

71

pears to be weak 5 . Much of the variability in these early results is likely due to the use

72

of inappropriate response variables (such as cases or fatalities) which fail to capture the

73

intrinsic variations in transmission intensity driven by the effects of non-pharmaceutical

74

intervention measures 5 . Furthermore, COVID-19 has taken hold in many places with

75

diverse climates and there are obvious examples of high transmission rates under hot,

76

humid conditions, e.g. in Brazil 26 .

77

Accurate assessment of the role environmental factors have played so far in the spread

78

of SARS-CoV-2 may provide insight into the future seasonality of the disease. This is

79

because seasonal outbreaks of viruses are often driven by their responses to favourable

80

(seasonal) changes in weather 27 . Most epidemiological forecasts make use of some variant

81

of the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) framework and/or focus on the impacts of

82

government-level mitigation (e.g. Kissler et al. 28 , Walker et al. 29 ). Few epidemiological

83

models incorporate environmental impacts and, when they do, they assume COVID-19

84

responds in a manner identical to related coronaviruses because we lack data on SARS-

85

CoV-2’s environmental (and thus seasonal) responses (e.g. Baker et al. 18 ). This is

86

despite theoretical demonstrations of the potential role of environment in driving future

87

seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 22,30 and the empirical evidence in structurally-similar viruses

88

outlined above. Efforts to incorporate climate into COVID-19 forecasting have focused

89

on regression-type models of cases and fatalities (e.g. Araujo and Naimi 17 ), which are

90

unreliable when diseases are in the growth/expansion phase 31 . Furthermore, such models

91

conflate environmental controls on occurrence with other drivers such as public health

92

interventions (e.g., the effects of lockdown measures to contain the pandemic) 31 as both

93

are changing similarly through time. Such models are unlikely to yield useful insights

94

and may be misleading to policymakers 13 . To address this knowledge gap, there is a need

95

for a true synthesis of environmental modelling with well-established epidemiological

96

approaches.

97

Here we investigate the role of environment in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by incor-

98

porating environmental factors into an existing epidemiological framework that has been

99

applied globally 32–34 , and to the USA in particular 35 . The USA is a large country with

100

great variation in climate across which case and policy intervention data are comparable,

101

permitting us to disentangle the role of environmental drivers in SARS-CoV-2 transmis-

102

sion. We begin by exploring associations between the environment (temperature, hu-

103

midity, UV radiation, and population density) and transmission intensity independently

104

estimated before and during stay-at-home orders (henceforth termed “lockdown”). We

105

used the basic reproduction number (R0 ) for our pre-lockdown transmission intensity

106

estimates, and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt , the reproduction number, R,

107

at a given time, t) averaged across an appropriate time-window for our during-lockdown

108

estimates. After confirming a potential role for the environment, we verify and more

109

accurately quantify the relative roles of temperature and population density by integrat-

110

ing them into an existing semi-mechanistic epidemiological framework 35 . While we find

111

strong evidence that temperature and population density are associated with SARS-CoV-

112

2 transmission, we emphasise that our findings also re-confirm that the major drivers of

113

transmission rates are public policy and individual behaviour. Through our use of exist-

114

ing, robust sources of forecasts and models, our findings can be easily incorporated into

115

workflows already used by policymakers, as we detail here.

Results

117

When analysed jointly, the R0 of all USA states are fairly well predicted by all explanatory

118

variables included in the regression model (i.e. population density, temperature, absolute

119

humidity and UV radiation), with an overall model adjusted r2 of 58% (supplementary

120

table S1). However, UV radiation is a very weak predictor of R0 , while temperature

121

and absolute humidity show sufficiently strong correlations with each other (r = 0.85)

122

that we cannot disentangle their contributions to R0 due to high inflation of variances

123

(supplementary table S1). This is further demonstrated through principal components

124

analysis, where temperature and absolute humidity fall along the same principal compo-

125

nent axis (supplementary figure S1). We therefore focused on temperature as the best

126

fitting climate variable (assessed by Pearson’s r, supplementary table S2).

127

When regressed against temperature and log10 -transformed population density only, we

128

find that R0 significantly increases with population density and decreases with tempera-

129

ture (fig. 1; both p < 0.001, table 1). We see a stark difference, however, when analysing

130

Rt during lockdown (defined as the mean Rt recorded over the 14 day period following a

131

stay at home order): much less of the variation in Rt is explained by the regression model

132

(adjusted r2 = 18%), vastly lower model coefficients for explanatory variables (i.e., much

133

lesser correlations; supplementary table S3, but note that population density is still a

134

significant predictor), and much lower Rt estimates overall (paired t39 = 21.1; p < 0.001;

135

figure 1b). Additionally, if we regress the combined R0 and Rt estimates against tem-

136

perature and population density, using lockdown as a binary interaction term, we find

137

a significant interaction between lockdown and temperature (p < 0.001, supplementary

138

table S5), i.e. lockdown mediates the effects of climate on transmission.

139

The strong correlates of population density and temperature on R0 across the United

140

States were echoed in our climate-driven Bayesian modelling of daily variation in Rt .

141

Posterior medians of the scaled coefficients of (log10 -transformed) population density and

142

daily temperature were 0.68 and −0.48, respectively. These coefficients were strongly

143

supported (both Bayesian probabilities > 99.9%), and suggest that greater population

144

density is approximately 1.4 times a greater driver of higher transmission than colder

145

0.68
≈ 1.4). Changes in mobility (such as those induced by stay-at-home
temperature ( 0.48

146

measures) have the potential to mitigate these impacts of both population density and

147

temperature (figure 3). Our model suggests that even quite large variation in underlying

148

transmission driven by either variation in temperature through time, or in population

149

density across space, can be mitigated by reductions in mobility (see also supplementary

150

figure S2). Critically, however, the posterior distributions are skewed, particularly for

151

population density: high population density may be difficult to mitigate except through

152

large mobility reductions (as shown by the credibility intervals in figure 3). We emphasise

153

that other transmission mitigation decisions, such as hand-washing, mask-wearing, and

154

physical distancing, were not assessed in our model. We highlight that the posterior

155

estimates of environment and average mobility were correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.30 for

156

temperature and r = −0.32 for population density). This likely results from correlated

157

changes in mobility and temperature through time, and makes the estimated mobility

158

reductions in figure 3 conservative (i.e., we potentially report larger mobility reductions

159

than would be necessary to mitigate environmental effects).
Table 1: Population density and temperature are drivers of R0 at state-level
in the USA. Multiple r2 = 0.6037, adjusted r2 = 0.5822, F2,37 = 28.18, p < 0.001.
Scaled estimates are coefficients when predictors are scaled to have mean = 0 and SD
= 1. Scaling our explanatory variables means our coefficients are measures of the relative
importance of each variable. In contrast to our epidemiological modelling, temperature
is a greater driver of pre-lockdown R0 than population density (log10 -transformed). * =

Discussion

161

Here, by combining epidemiological models and outputs with spatial climate data, we

162

show that environment (specifically cold, but also the correlated low-humidity conditions)

163

can enhance SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the USA. Critically, however, these envi-

164

ronmental impacts are weaker than that of population density which is, itself, a weaker

165

driver than policy intervention (i.e., lockdown). Below, we suggest that the accuracy of

166

forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, in particular across seasons, could be improved

167

by incorporating temperature, as well as population density, in a robust, reproducible

168

manner as we have done here.

169

The role that environment plays in transmission

170

Across these state-level USA data, we found a significant negative effect of temperature

171

on SARS-CoV-2’s R0 and a significant positive effect of population density. An important

172

caveat to this, however, is the collinearity between temperature, absolute humidity, and

173

to a lesser degree, UV levels. The strong correlations between these environmental drivers

174

mean that we are unable to discern the effects of each in a single model and therefore we

175

focus on temperature as the most reliable environmental predictor. After accounting for

176

the effect of population density on transmission (table 1), temperature’s effect is striking

177

(figure 2). We also tested the effects of our predictor variables on Rt for times where

178

strict lockdown measures were in place. When these mobility restrictions are in place, we

179

observe no significant effects of temperature on Rt , i.e. the effects of lockdown dampen

180

any environmental effects so as to make them inconsequential (figure 1b; supplementary

181

table S3). Furthermore, under lockdown conditions the overall transmission rates are

182

vastly reduced. Through our epidemiological modelling approach we are able to account

183

for these effects (as mobility changes are explicitly incorporated), and find that higher

184

population densities and lower temperatures drive increased Rt . Moreover, the formula-

185

tion of our epidemiological model ensures that under high mobility reductions, changes

186

in environment have little effect on Rt , mirroring our regression findings (see Methods

187

and supplementary figure S2).

188

The precise physiological mechanisms for temperature-dependant inactivation in SARS-

189

CoV-2 are still not known, but animal models for influenza have shown that increased

190

viral transmission at lower temperatures can be due to effects on the host 7,8 . In animal

191

models, this is proposed to be due to the combined effects of higher titres of viral particle

192

shedding and greater viral stability in nasal passages of those housed in cooler condi-

193

tions 8 . In addition to host effects, the persistence time of the virus outside of the body

194

is expected to be negatively affected by higher environmental temperatures, which cause

195

viral inactivation via breakdown of their lipid layers 10,12 . We emphasise that both the

196

direct host effects, and the potential effects of environment on viral stability, are likely

197

moderated (if not mitigated) by indoor heating 37 , although the same may not always be

198

true of humidity. Contact rate is related to population density 16 , and so it is unsurprising

199

that population density was a significant factor in our analysis (figure 1a). We stress that

200

temperature was not a driver of transmission under lockdown and the effects of popula-

201

tion density were lessened (figure 1b): outdoor conditions and population density matter

202

little for indoor transmission.

203

There are important methodological caveats to our findings. Dynamics and reporting

204

between USA states are known to be variable 38 , introducing a level of uncertainty to our

205

findings. Furthermore, lockdown measures were (and continue to be) quite heterogeneous

206

across the USA, with different states displaying different levels of response to COVID-

207

19 39 . Through our epidemiological modelling approach we are able to account for these

208

different state-level responses using google mobility data. We can also observe other

209

potential confounding factors in these analyses. Across the USA, the north-eastern states

210

in the vicinity of the major transport hub of New York City (e.g., NY, NJ, ME, PA, RI,

211

and CT) tend to have generally higher R0 than predicted, whilst west-coast states (e.g.,

212

WA, CA, and OR) have lower R0 than predicted (fig 2a). While this type of effect could be

213

due to preemptive protective measures taken by states prior to COVID-19 outbreaks, we

214

likely mitigated this by removing states that initiated non-pharmaceutical interventions

215

before our first time-step (see methods). A further confounding factor may be seen if

216

temperature affects human behaviour, thus making it difficult to disentangle the effects

217

of climate from changes to mobility. We do find a link between the average mobility and

218

temperature coefficients in our Bayesian modelling, suggesting a degree of collinearity,

219

however (perhaps surprisingly), we see no direct correlations between daily temperature

220

and recreational mobility trends for parks (see supplementary information). Again, this

221

highlights the importance of human behaviour as a confounding factor in analyses of

222

environmental drivers on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Future work should consider finer-

223

grained population density, as well as the presence of major transport hubs in a given

224

region.

225

Policy relevance of our findings

226

Our results comparing SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate before and during lockdown sup-

227

port the idea that the major driver of transmission is public health policy 32,40,41 (see figure

228

1). Once stay-at-home measures were implemented across the USA, we can find no mean-

229

ingful signal of temperature on transmission. This provides two important, and timely,

230

insights for policy-makers: summer weather is no substitute for mitigation, and policy can

231

prevent transmission in the winter. At the coarse scale of USA states, population den-

232

sity is a greater driver of transmission intensity than temperature in our epidemiological

233

modelling (log10 (population density) ≈ 1.4× larger scaled coefficient than temperature).

234

It should be considered whether thresholds for adaptive and/or intermittent lockdown

235

might be more precautionary (i.e., lower) in colder, more densely-populated regions.

236

However, we strongly suggest that this should neither be in order to allow other regions

237

to actively relax restrictions, nor conducted without further examination of finer-scale

238

disease dynamics. When making decisions about the relative importance of climate and

239

population density, it is important to account for the magnitude of variation in the two

240

variables. Temperature varies widely across the US, and that differences in transmission

241

rates between states (contrast, for example, Minnesota and Florida in figure 2) may vary

242

due to climate does not imply that more modest climate differences within a state drive

243

differences through time or across space. Regardless, our analysis is too spatially coarse

244

to address such variation. Even quite large variations in climate are more straightforward

245

to mitigate than population density differences (figure 3), and so we suggest that regions

246

with higher population density should continue to be monitored carefully. Finally, we

247

emphasise that population density and temperature are well-known to be strongly cor-

248

related across USA states (see also figure 2); this does not affect our model fitting of

249

coefficient estimates, but it does affect their interpretation. A more densely-populated

250

state is also likely to be warmer, and so we suggest that both factors (and others, such

251

as mobility) should be taken into account when trying to a priori estimate a region’s

252

transmission rate.

253

These results have strong implications for modellers considering the potential impacts

254

of seasonality on the virus. Such work has already considered the role that seasonality

255

might play by assuming responses of structurally similar and/or related diseases are

256

adequate proxies for SARS-CoV-2 18 . These assumptions are broadly correct, but here

257

we parameterise and quantify the magnitude of this effect for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings

258

suggest that previously unexplained variation among regions’ transmission, such as in

259

our independently-estimated R0 data, can be accounted for by environmental factors.

260

Further, our results support a role for daily temperature changes in transmission, but, we

261

emphasise, do not conflict with other studies suggesting that seasonal forecasting plays

262

a secondary role to mitigation and/or number of susceptible individuals. Such studies 18

263

assumed SARS-CoV-2 responds to climate to broadly similar extents that we find here.

264

What our results do suggest, however, is that future forecasting work should consider the

265

use of the environment to enhance predictions of disease spread. In countries such as the

266

USA with continental climates that swing between extremes of heat and cold, we suggest

267

policy-makers should assume that transmission will increase in winter (and potentially

268

autumn/fall). The timing of the seasons are broadly predictable, and so this is an area

269

in which policy could be proactive, not reactive.

Conclusion

271

There is no single cause of, or solution to, the current COVID-19 pandemic, and all drivers

272

must be placed in perspective. Here we suggest that both environment, and daily weather,

273

may play a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The major driver of transmission,

274

and our best method of controlling it, is public policy, as this and many other studies

275

have shown 40,41 . The role of environment in transmission has become controversial, in

276

part because of the application of models to case prevalence, rather than fundamental

277

epidemiological parameters such as R that we model here. We call for more researchers

278

to work directly with epidemiologists to identify those components of epidemiological

279

modelling that can be informed by outside specialists’ areas of expertise. By working

280

together, we can efficiently increase epidemiological research capacity to better combat

281

and control this pandemic.

Methods

283

We explored the association between environmental covariates and SARS-CoV-2 trans-

284

mission intensity using two approaches. First, we took existing state-level estimates of

285

R0 and during-lockdown Rt for the USA 35 , and regressed them against environmental

286

data in order to test for potential pre- and during-lockdown patterns. In the second

287

approach, we modified and fitted the existing semi-mechanistic epidemiological model

288

used to generate the R0 and Rt estimates above, and fitted it to the observed death

289

time series whilst explicitly incorporating the effects of the most important aspects of

290

environment (temperature and population density) on the virus. This second model

291

makes use of daily weather observations and provides a rigorous framework to quantify

292

the drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the USA. The first approach mitigates

293

potential biases arising from the autocorrelation of the initiation of lockdown and the

294

cessation of winter in the USA in the second approach, since our independent regression

295

focuses on initial transmission (i.e., R0 ). Below, all software packages given in italics

296

are R packages (version 3.6.3) 42 unless otherwise specified. Code to reproduce our anal-

297

yses, download source data, and update models with new data as it becomes available,

are given in both the supplementary materials and at our team’s GitHub repository

Data collection

301

We collated global population density data from the Center for International Earth Sci-

302

ence Information Network (CIESIN) 43 , and hourly temperature (T ), relative humid-

303

ity (RH) and surface UV radiation (in J m−2 ) estimates for 2020 from the Copernicus

304

Climate Change Service 44 . All the above data were at the same spatial resolution of

305

0.25x0.25◦ . The amount of water vapour air can hold increases with temperature and,

306

since in other viruses the absolute humidity (AH) of air can drive transmission more

307

than relative saturation 37,45 , we calculated absolute humidity from our data using the

308

the Clausius–Clapeyron relation and the ideal gas law 22,45 :

313

(461.53 J kg−1 K−1 ).

314

We used the Climate Data Operators program 46 to compute daily means for each of our

315

climate variables. Finally, we averaged the value of each covariate (median) across the

316

state-level administrative units given by GADM shapefiles 47 (the 50 USA states, plus

317

Washington DC).

318

Independent validation of the impact of environment on R0

319

To validate the impact of the environment on R0 we used an existing dataset of SARS-

320

CoV-2 transmission rate estimates for each of the states of the USA 35 . We used the

321

basic reproduction estimates (R0 , before the implementation of any non-pharmaceutical

322

interventions) as a fundamental measure of virus transmissibility in each state.

323

In these data, R0 is estimated as Rt=0 where t = 0 occurs 30 days prior to the first 10

324

cumulative deaths recorded for each state 32,35 . The date upon which R0 is estimated

325

therefore differs between states. To account for these temporal differences, we took the

326

means of our daily climate variables across the 14 days prior to t = 0 for each state

327

as an approximation for the conditions under which each population first experienced

328

COVID-19. To test the impact of the environment on R0 , we performed multiple linear

329

regression on R0 with temperature, absolute humidity, UV radiation, and population

330

density as predictors. To compare environmental effects on the reproduction number un-

331

der mobility restriction measures (i.e., lockdown), we took the average (mean) Rt across

332

the 14 days following a state-wide stay-at-home mandate and regressed these against

333

the environmental predictors averaged across the same time period. We used 14 days

334

again here for consistency with our environmental comparison to R0 . Although mobility

335

restrictions may differ in magnitude between states, these effects are incorporated into

336

the estimates for the Rt parameter. In 7 states (Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, Ne-

337

braska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming) no state-wide stay-at-home mandate

338

was declared. In a further 4 states (Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, and Utah), t = 0 occurred

339

after non-pharmaceutical interventions had already been instated. These 11 states were

340

therefore excluded from the independent validation analyses.

341

Integrative modelling of the impact of environment on SARS-

342

CoV-2 transmission

343

To further assess the potential impact of environment on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we

344

modified the semi-mechanistic Bayesian model 35 that generated the R0 and Rt estimates

345

used above to incorporate both population density and daily temperature (the best fitting

346

climate variable; see results), as follows:

Rt,m = (µ+ct,m C +pm P )·2InvLogit(−

X

region
state
(Xt,m,k αk )−Xt,m,1 αr(m)
−Xt,m,2 αm
−) (2)

347

Where µ captures overall transmission common to all states, c the coefficient for temper-

348

ature (Ct,m ; in degrees C) at time (t) in state m, p the coefficient for population density

349

(Pm ) of state m (log10 -transformed people per km2 ). We standardised ct,m and pm to have

350

a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, in order to make their absolute magnitudes mea-

351

sures of the relative importance of each term and thus facilitate their comparison. We

352

placed strong, conservative priors on these new model terms, specifically:

ct,m , pm ∼ N ormal(0, 0.5)

353

µ ∼ N ormal(3.28, 0.5)

(4)

354

For µ, this is the same as the prior used in the original (non-climate) model 35 (but see

355

our caveat below about this term). The other terms are unchanged from their original

356

definitions given in Unwin et al. 35 , and we briefly describe them below. InvLogit is

357

the inverse logit transformation applied to a series of hierarchically-nested terms (αk ,

358

region
state
αr(m)
, and αm
) multiplied by Google mobility data 36 (Xt,m,k ) with a weekly AR(2)

359

autocorrelated error term for each state (; see Unwin et al. 35 for more details). Xt,m,k are

360

three US-wide measures of the impact of changing mobility across states (a daily proxy

361

for lockdown intensity) on ‘average’ across retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy,

362

and workplace trips (Xt,m,1 ), in ‘residential’ areas (Xt,m,2 ), and using public ‘transit’

363

(Xt,m,3 ). We focus on the vector αk , whose three entries assess the impact of mobility

364

comparably across the country (and thus are each analogous to c and p). The terms

365

region
state
address differences in average mobility across eight broad geographic
αr(m)
and αm

366

regions [the Great Lakes, Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, Northeast Corridor, Pacific

367

North-West, South Atlantic, Southern Appalachia, and the South (‘TOLA’); indexed by

368

r(m)] and for transit across individual states (m), respectively. While we attempted to

369

address comparable hierarchically-nested temperature responses in this model, we felt

370

the correlation between changes in Xt,m,k and ct,m were inducing fitting problems and

371

so opted for a model simpler (and so more conservative) in its novel components. In

372

this model formulation, temperature and population density essentially contribute to a

373

latent transmission rate, which is then mediated by the mobility terms to produce the

374

realised Rt . Although an interaction between mobility and environment (as found in our

375

regression modelling, see Results) is not explicitly modelled, this formulation produces

376

results analogous that finding, i.e. when mobility reductions are high (“lockdown”),

377

environment has little effect on the realised Rt (see supplementary figure S2).

378

We emphasise that the model presented here differs from the original model by fitting

379

a common µ across all states, instead of allowing each state to have a different baseline

380

µ that was hierarchically drawn from a common parameter (itself termed µ in Unwin

381

et al. 35 ). This difference ensures identifiability of our model parameters, since the (la-

382

tent, and hierarchically pooled) state-wise means are strongly driven by both population

383

density and environment that are now included in the model (see results). Our model,

384

which was directly adapted from the code in Unwin et al. 35 , was fit using rstan 48 with

385

5 independent chains (each with 3,000 total iterations and a warm-up of 1,000). Full

386

model coefficients and outputs are given in the supplementary materials (supplementary

387

388

values for each state through time were realistic and sensible and all chains had mixed

389

and converged.
