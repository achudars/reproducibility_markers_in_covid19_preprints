Abstract
Approximately 10% of infants will experience COVID-19 illness requiring advanced care (1). A
potential mechanism to protect this population could be provided by passive immunity through
the milk of a previously infected mother. We and others have reported on the presence of SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk (2-5). We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
IgA in the milk of 75 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 88% of samples are
positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity
as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA positive
specimens were also positive for Spike-specific antibodies bearing the secretory component.
Levels of IgA antibodies and antibodies bearing secretory component were shown to be strongly
positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested
compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of hightiter in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6
weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant
Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally,
COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing
antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC50
range, 2.39 – 89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities
were found to be strongly positively correlated. These data are highly relevant to public health,
not only in terms of the protective capacity of these antibodies for breastfed infants, but also for
the potential use of such antibodies as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given that secretory IgA is
highly stable not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all mucosa including the
gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs (6).

Background
Though COVID-19 pathology among children is typically more mild compared to adults,
approximately 10% of infants under the age of one year experience severe COVID-19 illness
requiring advanced care, and an ever-growing number of children appear to exhibit signs of
“Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19” weeks
or months after exposure (1, 7). Furthermore, infants and young children can also transmit
SARS-CoV-2 to others and the efficacy of vaccines available for adults have not yet been
evaluated for young children or infants (8). Certainly, protecting this population from infection is
essential (9).
One potential mechanism of protection is passive immunity provided through breastfeeding by a
previously-infected mother. Mature human milk contains ~0.6mg/mL of total immunoglobulin
(10). Approximately 90% of human milk antibody (Ab) is IgA, nearly all in secretory (s) form
(sIgA, which consists of polymeric Abs complexed to J-chain and secretory component (SC)
proteins) (11). Nearly all sIgA derives from the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), via the
entero-mammary link, though there is also homing of B cells from other mucosa (e.g., from the
respiratory system), and possibly drainage from local lymphatics of systemic IgA to the
mammary gland (11). Unlike the Abs found in serum, sIgA found in milk is highly stable and
resistant to enzymatic degradation not only in milk and the infant mouth and gut, but in all
mucosae including the gastrointestinal tract, upper airway, and lungs (6). Notably, after two
hours in the infant stomach, the total IgA concentration decreases by <50%, while IgG
concentration decreases by >75%; importantly, though total SC concentration decreases by
~60%, there ia no decrease in the stomach of infants born pre-term (within the first 3 months of
life) – a population highly vulnerable to infection (12).

Previously we reported on 15 milk samples obtained early in the pandemic from donors recentlyrecovered from a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 (2). In that preliminary study, it was
found that all samples exhibited significant IgA binding activity against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.
Eighty percent of samples further tested for Ab binding reactivity to the receptor binding domain
(RBD) of the Spike exhibited significant IgA binding, and all of these samples were also positive
for RBD-specific secretory Ab reactivity with only small subsets of samples exhibiting specific
IgG and/or IgM activity, strongly suggesting the RBD-specific IgA was sIgA. In the present
study, we report on the prevalence and isotypes of Spike-specific milk Ab from a larger cohort of
donors obtained 4-6 weeks post-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the durability of these
Abs up to 10 months post-infection, and on SARS-CoV-2-directed neutralization by Abs in a
subset of these samples,

Methods
Study participants
Individuals were eligible to have their milk samples included in this analysis if they were
lactating and had a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 4-6 weeks prior to the initial
milk sample used for analysis. Certain participants were also able to continue participation in the
study and provide a follow-up sample 4-10 months after confirmed infection. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Mount Sinai Hospital (IRB 19-01243).
Milk was frozen in participants’ home freezers until samples were picked up and stored at -80°C
until Ab testing. Pre-pandemic negative control milk samples were obtained in accordance with
IRB-approved protocols prior to December, 2019 for other studies, and had been stored in

laboratory freezers at -80°C before processing following the same protocol described for
COVID-19 milk samples.
ELISA
Levels of SARS-CoV-2 Abs in human milk were measured as previously described (2). Briefly,
before Ab testing, milk samples were thawed, centrifuged at 800g for 15 min at room
temperature, fat was removed, and the de-fatted milk transferred to a new tube. Centrifugation
was repeated 2x to ensure removal of all cells and fat. Skimmed acellular milk was aliquoted and
frozen at -80°C until testing. Both COVID-19 recovered and control milk samples were then
tested in separate assays measuring IgA, IgG, and secretory-type Abs, in which the secondary Ab
used for the latter measurement was specific for free and bound SC. Half-area 96-well plates
were coated with the full trimeric recombinant Spike protein produced, as described previously
(13). Plates were incubated at 4°C overnight, washed in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T), and
blocked in PBS-T/3% goat serum/0.5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Milk was used
undiluted or titrated 4-fold in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS and added to the plate. After
2h incubation at room temperature, plates were washed and incubated for 1h at room temperature
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human-IgA, goat anti-human-IgG (Fisher), or
goat anti-human-secretory component (MuBio) diluted in 1% BSA/PBS. Plates were developed
with 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) reagent followed by 2N hydrochloric acid (HCl) and
read at 450nm on a BioTek Powerwave HT plate reader. Assays were performed in duplicate and
repeated 2x.
IgA extraction from milk
Total IgA was extracted from 25 – 100mL of milk using peptide M agarose beads (Pierce)

following manufacturer’s protocol, concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (10 kDa
cutoff; Millipore Sigma) and quantified by Nanodrop.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay
Neutralization assays were performed using a standardized SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-based assay with ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing 293T cells
as previously described (14). Briefly, pseudovirus was produced by transfection of 293T cells
with SARS-CoV-2 Spike plasmid, followed 8 h later by infection with a VSVΔG-rLuc reporter
virus. Two days post-infection, supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation (14).
A pre-titrated amount of pseudovirus was incubated with serial dilutions of extracted IgA for 30
min at room temperature prior to infection of cells seeded the previous day. Twenty hours postinfection, cells were processed and assessed for luciferase activity as described (14).
Analytical Methods
Control milk samples obtained prior to December 2019 were used to establish positive cutoff
values for each assay. Milk was defined as positive for the SARS-CoV-2 Abs if OD values
measured using undiluted milk from COVID-19-recovered donors were two standard
deviations (SD) above the mean ODs obtained from control samples. Endpoint dilution titers
were determined from log-transformed titration curves using 4-parameter non-linear
regression and an OD cutoff value of 1.0. Endpoint dilution positive cutoff values were
determined as above. Percent neutralization was calculated as (1- (average luciferase RLU of
triplicate test wells – average luciferase expression RLU of 6 ‘virus only’ control wells)
*100. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess significant differences in the grouped
COVID-19-recovered and control extracted IgA neutralization capacities. The concentration

of milk IgA required to achieve 50% neutralization (IC50) was determined as described
above for endpoint determination. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman
correlations. All statistical tests were performed in GraphPad Prism, were 2-tailed, and
significance level was set at p-values < 0.05.

Results
Ab profile in milk from COVID-19-recovered donors 4-6 weeks after infection.
Skimmed acellular milk was aliquoted and frozen at -80o C until testing. Undiluted milk
samples obtained 4-6 weeks post-infection from 75 COVID-19-recovered donors, and 20 prepandemic milk samples obtained prior to December, 2019 were screened in our IgA ELISA
against recombinant trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Sixty-six of 75 samples (88%) were positive
for Spike-specific IgA, with the COVID-19 samples exhibiting significantly higher Spikespecific IgA binding compared to controls (Fig. 1a; p<0.0001). Following this initial screening,
40 of the Spike-positive samples were further titrated to determine binding endpoint titers as an
assessment of Ab affinity and/or quantity (Fig. 1b). Thirty-eight of 40 (95%) Spike-reactive
samples exhibited positive IgA endpoint titers and 19 of these samples (50%) were ≥5 times
higher than the endpoint titer of the positive cutoff value, and were therefore designated as
‘high-titer’ (Fig.1c).
Additionally, 20 samples assayed for Spike-specific IgA were also assessed for Spike-specific
secretory Ab (by detecting for SC), and IgG. Nineteen of these undiluted milk specimens (95%)
from convalescent COVID-19 donors were positive for Spike-specific secretory Abs compared
to pre-pandemic control milk (Fig. 2a). One sample (COV125) was negative for specific IgA
but positive for specific secretory Ab, while another sample (COV123) was positive for

specific IgA but negative for specific secretory Ab. Eighteen undiluted milk samples (95%)
exhibiting Spike-specific secretory Ab activity also exhibited positive endpoint titers (Fig. 2c).
Of the samples found to be high-titer for Spike-specific IgA, 7 were also high-titer for specific
secretory Ab (70%). Mean OD values for undiluted milk and endpoint titers were used in
separate Spearman correlation tests to compare IgA and secretory Ab reactivity (Fig. 2e). It
was found that IgA and secretory Ab levels were positively correlated (using ODs: r=0.77,
p<0.0001; using endpoint titers: r=0.86, p<0.0001). Additionally, 15/20 undiluted milk
samples from COVID-19-recovered donors were positive for Spike-specific IgG compared to
pre-pandemic controls (75%; Fig. 2b), with 13/15 of these samples exhibiting a positive
endpoint titer (87%; Fig. 2d), and 2/15 designated as high titer with values ≥5 times cutoff
(13%). No correlation was found between IgG and IgA titers or between IgG and SC titers (data
not shown).

Durability of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific milk IgA response
To assess the durability of this sIgA-dominant response, 28 pairs of milk samples obtained
from COVID-19-recovered donors 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection were assessed
for Spike-specific IgA. All donors exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA titers of
the period of follow-up. Mean endpoint titers from the early to the late milk samples grouped
were not significantly different (Fig. 3a). Fourteen donors (50%) exhibited >10% decrease in
IgA titer, 12 donors (43%) exhibited >10% increase in IgA titer, and 2 donors (7%) exhibited
no change in titer (Fig. 3a). Notably, only 2 donors (7%) exhibited >50% decrease in titer over
time. Furthermore, examining a subset of these samples with the longest follow-up, obtained 710 months after infection, mean endpoint titers measured from the early to the late milk

samples were also not significantly different (data not shown). These longest follow-up
samples included 5 donors (36%) with >10% decrease in IgA titer, 8 donors (57%) with >10%
increase in IgA titer, and 1 donor (7%) with no change in titer (Fig. 3b). Only 1 donor (7%)
exhibited >50% decrease in titer, and as with the larger durability cohort, all donors exhibited
persistently significant Spike-specific IgA titers.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity of total milk IgA from COVID-19-recovered donors
Total IgA was extracted from 8 COVID-19 and 8 control milk samples analyzed for Spikespecific Ab profile. All 8 COVID-19 samples had been shown to exhibit positive Spike-specific
IgA and secretory Ab titers (Figs 1-2). Neutralization capacity was tested using a Vesicular
Stomatitis Virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus assay, wherein the native VSV surface protein G is
replaced by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, as described previously ((14); Fig. 4). At the maximum
concentration tested (200ug/mL total purified milk IgA), 6/8 (75%) COVID-19 samples
exhibited >50% neutralization (mean, 87% neutralization; range, 70% - 100%), while only 1/8
control samples (13%) achieved this benchmark (94% neutralization; Fig. 4a). Mean percent
neutralization values at 50ug/ml extracted IgA were grouped and compared among COVID-19
and pre-pandemic control samples. COVID-19 samples exhibited significantly greater
neutralization compared to controls (p=0.0064; Fig. 4b). As well, when the concentration of IgA
required to achieve 50% neutralization (IC50) was determined, 7/8 pre-pandemic controls did
not achieve 50% neutralization (IC50>200ug/mL while, for the COVID-19 samples, 2/8 did not
achieve 50% neutralization, and the mean IC50 for the 6 COVID19 specimens that displayed
neutralizing activity was 33.6ug/mL of total IgA (range, 2.39 – 89.4ug/mL; Fig. 4c). Finally, we
compared the neutralization IC50 titers to the IgA endpoint titers measured for these samples

(Fig. 1). There was a significant positive correlation between IgA binding and neutralization
capacities (r=0.83, p=0.0154; Fig. 4d). Notably, the 2 non-neutralizing COVID-19 IgA samples
also exhibited the lowest IgA endpoint titers (COV121, COV130; mean IgA endpoint titers of 19
and 17, respectively), while the 6 neutralizing samples exhibited high Spike-specific IgA binding
titers (Figs. 1c, 4c).

Discussion
There has been no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmits via human milk, with sporadic cases of
viral RNA (not infectious particles) detected on breast skin (3); however, there have been reports
of viral RNA in the milk (reviewed in (15)), though collection methods in these reports did not
necessarily include masking, cleaning of the breast, or even handwashing to avoid contamination
from the donor’s environment. As such, the WHO and CDC recommend that infants not be
separated from SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers, and that breastfeeding should be established and
not disrupted (depending on the mothers’ desire to do so), in combination with masking and
other hygiene efforts (16, 17).
We and others have reported SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs in milk obtained from donors with
previously confirmed or suspected infection (2-5). Here, we have significantly expanded our
earlier work in which we reported on SARS-CoV-2 Ab prevalence among 75 COVID-19recovered participants whose milk samples were obtained 4-6 weeks after confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection. Indeed, we have confirmed among this much larger sample set that a SARSCoV-2 IgA Ab response in milk after infection is very common. This IgA response dominates
compared to the measurable but relatively less frequent IgG response that is markedly less
robust. Importantly, a very strong positive correlation was found between Spike-specific milk

IgA and secretory Abs, using both ELISA OD values of Ab binding in undiluted milk as well as
Ab binding endpoint titers, indicating that a very high proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 Spikespecific IgA measured in milk after SARS-CoV-2 infection is sIgA, confirming our early reports.
This is relevant for the effective protection of a breastfeeding infant, given the high durability of
secretory Abs in the relatively harsh mucosal environments of the infant mouth and gut (6, 12).
These data are also relevant to the possibility of using extracted milk IgA as a COVID-19
therapy. Extracted milk sIgA used therapeutically would likely survive well upon targeted
respiratory administration, with a much lower dose of Ab likely needed for efficacy compared to
systemically-administered convalescent plasma or purified plasma immunoglobulin.
All COVID-19 IgA samples analyzed that had been designated as ‘high titer’ for Spike-specific
IgA exhibited significant Spike-directed neutralization capacity, wherein IgA binding endpoint
titers and neutralization IC50 values were found to be significantly correlated. Of the 3 samples
examined for neutralization capacity that exhibited positive but not high titer Spike-specific IgA,
2 were non-neutralizing. It should be noted that these were all samples obtained 4-6 weeks after
infection, and future samples may exhibit neutralization as the Ab response matures. These data
extend the recent analyses of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization using diluted whole milk (3, 5).
Critically, our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10
months after infection revealed that for all donors, Spike-specific IgA titers persisted for as long
as 10 months, a finding that is highly relevant for protection of the breastfeeding infant over the
course of lactation, and also pertinent to the size of a potential donor pool for collection of milk
from COVID-19-recovered donors for therapeutic use of extracted milk IgA. Notably, even after
7-10 months, only 5 of 14 samples exhibited >10% decrease in specific IgA endpoint titers,
while 8 of 14 samples actually exhibited an increase in specific IgA titer. These highly durable or

even increased titers may be reflective of long-lived plasma cells in the GALT and/or mammary
gland, as well as continued antigen stimulation in these compartments, possibly by other human
coronaviruses, or repeated exposures to SARS-CoV-2.
Given the present lack of knowledge concerning the potency, function, durability, and variation
of the human milk immune response not only to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but across this
understudied field in general, the present data contributes greatly to filling immense knowledge
gaps and furthers our work towards in vivo efficacy testing of extracted milk Ab in the COVID19 pandemic context and beyond.
