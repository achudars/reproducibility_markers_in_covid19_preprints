Abstract

24

The benefits of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for tracking the viral load of SARS-

25

CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, have become apparent since the start of the pandemic.

26

However, most sampling occurs at the wastewater treatment plant influent and therefore can only

27

monitor SARS-CoV-2 concentration and spread within the entire catchment, which can

28

encompass multiple municipalities. Furthermore, most WBE only quantifies the virus, and

29

therefore miss crucial information that can be gained by sequencing SARS-CoV-2. Here we

30

demonstrate feasibility of sampling at the neighborhood or building complex level using a mix of

31

quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted sequencing to provide a more

32

refined understanding of the local dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains. When coupled with the

33

higher-level treatment plant samples, this creates an opportunity for health officials to monitor

34

the spread of the virus at different spatial and temporal scales to inform policy decisions.

35

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of tracking SARS-CoV-2 at the neighborhood, hospital,

36

and nursing home level with the ability to detect one COVID-19 positive out of 60 nursing home

37

residents. The viral load obtained was correlative with the number of COVID-19 patients being

38

treated in the hospital. Sequencing of the samples over time demonstrated that nonsynonymous

39

mutations fluctuate in the viral population, and wastewater-based sequencing could be an

40

efficient approach to monitor for vaccine or convalescent plasma escape mutants, as well as

41

mutations that could reduce the efficacy of diagnostics. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 was

42

detected by untargeted RNA sequencing, qPCR and targeted whole genome amplicon

43

sequencing were more reliable methods for tracking the pandemic. From our sequencing data,

44

clades and shifts in mutation profiles within the community were traceable and could be used to

45

determine if vaccine or diagnostics need to be adapted to ensure continued efficacy.

1.1 Introduction

50

Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) is a rapidly growing field for the surveillance of

51

pathogen load within human populations. Since it was discovered that SARS-CoV-2, the

52

causative agent of COVID-19, can be quantified from feces (Wu et al., 2020b), WBE has been

53

adapted to tracking the pandemic. Indeed, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based

54

wastewater testing has been implemented by several countries and states to track the COVID-19

55

pandemic by monitoring the viral load in wastewater (Achak et al., 2020; Ahmed et al., 2020;

56

Bivins et al., 2020; Crits-Christoph et al., 2021; Foladori et al., 2020; Gonzalez et al., 2020;

57

Gormley et al., 2020; Hamouda et al., 2020; Haramoto et al., 2020; Hart and Halden, 2020;

58

Kitajima et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Murakami et al., 2020; Weidhaas et al., 2020;

59

Westhaus et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2020a). To maximize the information gathered from

60

wastewater-based testing, we propose that targeted sequencing should be used in tandem with

61

qPCR to determine the viral load and identify the dominant viral strain in circulation, including

62

mutations that could affect diagnostic or therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, WBE implemented

63

within catchments at the neighborhood or building level will enable a more refined map of

64

COVID-19 hotspots.

65

WBE has gained popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its ability to track the

66

amount of the virus in a population using non-invasive sampling techniques (Murakami et al.,

67

2020). Most studies sample influent to the wastewater treatment plant, which provides the ability

68

to monitor the entire catchment, but does not have the resolution to gain a more detailed

69

understanding of virus hotspots within that catchment. Hotspot information would be helpful for

70

contact tracers to focus on neighborhoods, or for COVID-19 conscious individuals to determine

71

what part of town is safest to go grocery shopping. The objectives of the current study were to

72

demonstrate the application of WBE to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within a city and

73

develop analytical pipelines to maximize information collected from these samples. In this work,

74

wastewater was sampled from manholes located at mapped sewer junction points in the same

75

city to provide a refined picture of COVID-19 prevalence in those communities.

76

WBE primarily focuses on viral load as the measure used to track SARS-CoV-2 prevalence

77

and spread, but the technology exists for obtaining a more nuanced view of the viral strains and

78

mutations that are in the samples. In this work, we explored not only qPCR to determine the viral

79

load, but also targeted whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, and untargeted RNA

80

sequencing to determine if SARS-CoV-2 can be detected without enrichment along with other

81

pathogens of public health concern. Ideally, a wastewater-based tracking method should be

82

optimized to understand all pathogen dynamics over time in a population. This can be achieved

83

by non-targeted sequencing methods.

84

The sampling locations in this study were chosen specifically to enable comparison of viral

85

load in wastewater to known case load or resident population numbers mapped to the sewer

86

junction points. Two manholes used for sampling were located directly outside of major

87

hospitals known to be treating COVID-19 patients, one was located outside of a nursing home,

88

and a fourth manhole was located downstream of a residential neighborhood. The neighborhood

89

also has a known number of residents, but an unknown number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore,

90

the data collected could inform an estimated viral load in the community which may be

91

correlated to the number of cases. Furthermore, two different RNA extraction methods and two

92

sequencing approaches were used and evaluated to determine the most viable method to provide

93

as much information as possible from each sample.

94

1.2 Materials and Methods

95

1.2.1 Wastewater sample collection.

96

One-liter sample collections were conducted at four specific locations in Toledo, OH from

97

manhole access once a week for three weeks. The first week of sampling, at three locations, the

98

sample collections were grab samples due to low flow. The fourth location, Promedica Toledo

99

Hospital, was collected as a 24-hour composite using an autosampler (ISCO 3700C). The

100

subsequent collections at all locations were 24-hour composite samples. In low flow situations, a

101

bucket was used to collect wastewater prior to use of the autosampler to ensure enough volume

102

was present for the composite collection. All samples were collected between 10 AM and 12 PM

103

EST and placed on ice in coolers during transportation to the analytical laboratory. As back up

104

during analysis, 250 mL of each wastewater sample was stored. The following sample metadata

105

was gathered each week during each sample collection: time of collection, method of collection,

106

pH of samples, ambient temperature, and water temperature at time of collection.

107

1.2.2 Viral particle concentration.

108

To encourage detachment of virions from organic material in the wastewater, 107 mL of

109

glycine buffer (0.05M glycine, 3% beef extract, pH 9.6) was added to 750 mL of wastewater and

110

mixed for one minute (Vlok et al., 2019). The samples were then centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 30

111

minutes. The supernatant was filtered through 0.22 micron filters to remove bacteria, fungi, or

112

eukaryotic cells present in the samples. The virions were precipitated from the filtrate using a

113

PEG-8000/NaCl solution ((PEG/NaCl) 320g/L PEG-8000, 70 g/L (w/v) NaCl) at a ratio of one-

114

part PEG/NaCl to three parts filtrate (Wu et al., 2020a). Mixtures were gently stirred for 12 hours

115

at 4°C. Precipitated virions were collected by centrifugation for 90 minutes at 13,000 x g at 4°C.

116

Pellets were resuspended in 600 µL 1x PBS. The volume changes throughout processing were

117

captured to enable back calculation of total viral load.

118

1.2.3 Viral RNA extraction.

119

Two methods were used for RNA extraction. First, RNA was extracted from the collected

120

viral preparations using TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher, Cat# 15596026) following the

121

manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quantity and quality were measured by NanoDrop. Second,

122

viral RNA was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52904) following the

123

manufacturer’s protocol.

124

1.2.4 qPCR.

125

Each RNA sample was analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain

126

reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting the nucleocapsid gene segment (N1) to determine the SARS-CoV-

127

2 viral load. Briefly, 5 µL of 4X TaqMan Fast Viral One-Step Master Mix (ThermoFisher, Cat#

1.2.5 RNA Virus metagenomics.

138

Total RNA was sequenced from each sample. RNA libraries were prepared using the Rapid

139

RNAseq kit (Swift, Cat# R2096) from Swift Biosciences and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq

140

using two NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kits v2.5 (150 Cycles, 75x 75 bp). No template control

141

libraries were prepared alongside RNAseq samples, but not sequenced. Data were analyzed

sequences in the refseq database using BlastN or BlastX- DIAMOND to identify pathogens in

148

the wastewater samples.

149

1.2.6 COVID-19 amplicon sequencing.

150

Samples were tested specifically for SARS-CoV-2 by amplicon sequencing using the SNAP

151

SARS-CoV-2 Kit (Swift, Cat# SN-5X296 and COVG1-96) from Swift Biosciences. Briefly, first

152

strand cDNA was synthesized from 11 µL of total RNA from each sample using the Superscript

153

IV First Strand Synthesis System with random hexamers (Invitrogen, Cat# 18091050) following

154

the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting cDNA (10µL) was used as template for the SARS-

155

CoV-2 Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to sequencing, the samples were

156

quantified by Qubit HS DNA kit (Invitrogen, Cat# Q32851), pooled, and sequenced on an

157

Illumina MiSeq 300 cycle V3 flow cell (Illumina, Cat# MS-102-2002). Samples were batched by

158

week to enable high depth of coverage for single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The

159

amplicon data were aligned to the NCBI Reference Sequence NC_045512.2 (Severe acute

160

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome) and analyzed using

161

the pipeline provided by Swift Biosciences. A positive control and a no template control were

162

processed and quantified. The no template control was not sequenced, but the positive control

163

was sequenced demonstrating full genome coverage of reference sequence NC_045512.2.

170

management team and the Toledo-Lucas County Public Health Department to ensure the sites

were in locations with a high probability of SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Two sites were the direct

1.4.2 Known case load at sampling sites by week and qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2.

183

The RNA extracted by the TRIzol reagent did not show evidence of any SARS-CoV-2 in the

184

samples, however, the QIAamp Viral/Pathogen RNA preparations produced detectable levels of

185

SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR in 9 of the 12 samples (Table 1). For comparison, the percentage of

186

known COVID-19 cases in the hospitals and nursing home were determined by dividing the

187

number of known COVID-19 positive patients by the total number of inpatients, and a weak

188

positive correlation is observed between the number of infected and viral load in the wastewater.

1.4.4 Non-targeted RNAseq detection of SARS-CoV-2

198

In theory, RNAseq should afford direct SARS-CoV-2 signature detection in wastewater without

199

requiring enrichment. However, despite following viral concentration protocols, a large amount

200

of the sequence data was found to map to other organisms such as bacteria, bacteriophage, and

201

eukaryotic organisms (Figure 3). Reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in only five out

202

of the twelve samples, with at most 3 reads mapping to the viral genome, despite there being an

203

average of 11M raw reads per sample and 3M filtered reads per sample. SARS-CoV-2 was

204

detected in Cresthaven samples collected week 1 (3 reads) and week 2 (3 reads), and St.

205

Vincent’s samples collected in week 1 (1 read), week 2 (2 reads), and week 3 (2 reads). This low

206

coverage is not sufficient for confidence in reporting presence of the pathogen at the local level.

207

Due to the relatively small genome and other larger genomes present in the wastewater, the

208

SARS-CoV-2 reads were likely obscured. We therefore recommend tracking the pandemic using
g

209

a local surveillance level (residential neighborhoods or buildings) combined with a targeted

210

enrichment method, such as amplicon-based sequencing.

215

Despite removal of microorganisms and enrichment for viral particles, a large portion of the

216

sequencing data (51-90%) mapped to bacteria, and a fraction of the data (1-19%) mapped to

217

macroorganisms, which demonstrates our viral preparation also included RNA from lysed cells

218

220

pathogens (Figure 4). While not pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, this finding

221

demonstrates that other pathogenic organisms can be identified and tracked using wastewater

222

sequencing, and therefore non-targeted wastewater sequencing could be continued after the

223

pandemic wanes to improve our understanding of pathogen distribution within local

224

communities and healthcare facilities. Several pathogenic categories of interest were detected in

225

the hospitals, nursing home, and community, including microbes associated with nosocomial

226

infections, gastroenteritis, cystitis, pneumonia, septicemia, and tetanus (Figure 5) from

227

assembled contigs. The etiological agents identified for nosocomial infections included the

228

Acinetobacter species: A. baumannii A. junii SH205, and A. Iwoffii SH145. Campylobacter jejuni

229

subsp. jejuni BH-01-0142, a known cause of gastroenteritis, was identified in the Cresthaven

230

neighborhood, the Continuing Healthcare nursing home, and St. Vincent’s Hospital. The

231

causative agent of cystitis identified in the first week of testing at Continuing Healthcare was

232

Escherichia coli UTI89. This data suggests that WBE can be utilized to track contagions outside

233

of a pandemic and could be a beneficial tool for future epidemiological and biosurveillance

234

studies.

1.4.5 Amplicon sequencing

248

The whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 was enriched from the wastewater samples by targeted

249

amplicon sequencing, enabling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion

250

mutations (indels) to be identified when aligned to the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 Genome

251

Wuhan HU-1. Table 2 presents non-synonymous mutations identified in the Toledo samples that
at

252

are unique (previously unobserved) or existing mutations (previously observed). Of the twelve

253

samples analyzed in this study, nine were COVID-19 positive based on qPCR. Sequencing the

254

positive samples, only five produced full genomes with enough coverage for confident calls:

255

weeks 1 and 2 from the Cresthaven neighborhood and weeks 1, 2, and 3 from St. Vincent’s

256

hospital (Table 2 and Figure 6). The mutations identified enabled Clade classification.

Community samples taken from the Cresthaven neighborhood fell into Clade GH, which carries

258

the Spike D614G mutation. St. Vincent’s data showed several mutations at variable penetrance

259

indicating multiple strains are present in these samples (Figure 6), therefore the Clade was

260

described as Other. Despite having multiple strains present, all three weeks had SARS-CoV-2

261

sequences carrying the Spike D614G mutation.

267

A week-to-week comparison of Cresthaven samples yielded highly similar existing

268

nonsynonymous mutation loads with ten mutations observed in both weeks. In addition, different

269

unique nonsynonymous mutations were observed, and one existing nonsynonymous mutation

270

was lost from week 1 to week 2. All three weeks from St. Vincent’s had five existing

271

nonsynonymous mutations in common (NSP2_T85I, NSP3_M1788I, NSP12_P323L,

272

NSP16_R216C, and Spike_D614G). However, St. Vincent’s weeks 1 and 2 had an additional

273

five existing nonsynonymous mutations in common (NSP5_L89F, NSP14_N129D, NS3_Q57H,

274

NS8_S24L, and N_P67S), demonstrating that nonsynonymous mutation load has changed over

275

time.

276

Similarly, the number of SNPs and indels in the whole genome sequencing data changed

277

over time at each site (Table 3). The three genes most targeted by diagnostics were prone to both

278

SNPs and indels, demonstrating the importance of continuous monitoring by sequencing as the

279

pandemic continues. Over the three weeks of this study, the viral population present in the

280

effluent from St. Vincent’s underwent the most striking changes, with the total number of SNPs

281

and indels increasing each week. Importantly, two deletions found in the S protein in the third

282

week of sampling (7/28/20) at St. Vincent’s was represented in 34% of the data; a deletion of a

283

full codon, ΔACC23493-23496, found in 9% of the data, and one was found at 25%: ΔG24696.

1.5 Discussion
The objective of this work was to first demonstrate the utility of wastewater surveillance at

288

the neighborhood or hospital level and then to identify the best method for tracking SARS-CoV-

289

2 and other pathogens to enable a population-based approach to pandemic biosurveillance. Our

290

data have demonstrated that while total RNAseq, targeted whole genome sequencing, and qPCR

291

methodologies can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, a combination of qPCR to

292

identify viral load and targeted whole genome sequencing to detect mutations provides deeper

293

insights to support public health decisions during pandemic surveillance than qPCR alone.

294

RNAseq, while identifying other pathogens present in the samples such as microbes that cause

295

nosocomial infections, periodontitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, or cystitis, did not recover

296

enough reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 to detect the viral pathogen with any confidence.

297

However, the non-targeted surveillance technique would effectively alert hospitals and long-term

298

care facilities to potential issues with nosocomial pathogens or residents that may have infections

299

that need to be treated and can otherwise go undiagnosed such as cystitis due to asymptomatic or

300

recurrent infections. Use in community settings would alert neighborhoods to potential norovirus

301

or Salmonella outbreaks and help public health officials pinpoint restaurants or grocery stores

302

selling contaminated products.

303

Utilizing amplicon sequencing to target and sequence the full SARS-CoV-2 genome enabled

304

mutation analysis of the viral population identified in the wastewater samples. As demonstrated

305

recently, new strains of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging which are hyper transmissible, and

306

potentially could carry mutations in the Spike protein that could be vaccine or convalescent

307

plasma therapy escape mutants (England, 2020; Kemp et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2021). Also, the

308

Spike, N, or Orf1ab genes are diagnostic targets so any SNP or indel identified in these genes

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.18.21251939; this version posted February 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

309

that could affect primer or probe binding of a diagnostic test are of high interest and need to be

310

reported to the scientific community to enable improved diagnostics. Indeed, several mutations

311

have been identified that affect different COVID-19 diagnostic tests (Wang et al., 2020).

312

Furthermore, nonsynonymous mutations in the Spike protein could indicate the potential for

313

vaccine escape and will need to be characterized to understand impact on vaccine efficacy.

314

Sequencing from wastewater samples within a city or at hospital effluent can aid in surveillance

315

of these mutations and reduces the burden on supplies, as instead of sampling, quantifying and

316

sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in individuals, wastewater enables population sampling, reducing the

317

number of assays and reagents used during surveillance.

318

With both convalescent plasma and the vaccines targeting the spike protein, it is imperative

319

that nonsynonymous mutations be monitored in this gene. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that

320

spike protein mutations increase in SARS-CoV-2 as a patient is treated with convalescent

321

plasma, indicating the antibodies are placing evolutionary pressure on the virus that selects for

322

mutations in this therapeutic target (Kemp et al., 2020). All Toledo wastewater samples

323

sequenced carried the Spike G614D mutation, which may confer higher transmissibility to the

324

virus, and is characteristic of clade G. Indeed, three of the sequenced samples were categorized

325

as GH and one as GR. In a study in Asia, clades GH and GR were found to contain high levels of

326

SNPs, indicating a lot of diversity in these strains (Sengupta et al., 2020). Mutation analysis of

327

wastewater samples collected in Toledo OH during July 2020 did not find signature for the two

328

SARSCoV2 clade 20C/G variants that were later identified in Columbus, OH (Tu et al.,

329

2021). Likewise, the strain UKB.1.1.7 (clade 20I/501Y.V1)(England, 2020; Galloway et al.,

330

2021), also thought to be hyper transmissible and bearing mutations in the S protein, was not

331

present in July 2020 Toledo, OH wastewater samples. However, another spike mutation,

332

Spike_N370K, was observed in week 1 of the Cresthaven neighborhood, and two deletions

333

(ΔACC23493-23496 and ΔG24696) were observed in week 3 at St. Vincent’s. Therefore,

334

wastewater-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can identify spike protein mutations which may

335

impact transmission and response to the vaccine or convalescent plasma therapy.

336

Most wastewater-based epidemiology takes place at the influent to a wastewater treatment

337

facility, providing a large catchment that encompasses multiple municipalities. In contrast, our

338

work focused on sampling effluent from a neighborhood, two hospitals, and a nursing home.

339

While these sites provided smaller population sizes and can have flow rate issues (some of our

340

sample locations could not provide 24-hour composites due to low flow), sampling at regions

341

within a city provides more refined information on where strains are circulating in the

342

community. For example, strains circulating in Cresthaven were all in the clade GH, while a

343

strain identified in Promedica Toledo Hospital belonged to clade GR, and strains at St. Vincent’s

344

were categorized as Other. While all strains bore some mutations in common, each week’s

345

sample had mutations unique to that sampling, demonstrating that mutations are common in

346

SARS-CoV-2, and several strains are present in one city.

347

While population size is a concern, qPCR from effluent of our smallest population, that of

348

the nursing home Continuing Healthcare, was able to detect the single case of COVID-19 in

349

week 3, from a population of 60 residents. Since Ohio has implemented weekly testing of

350

nursing home residents, this detection was confirmed by the public health department’s data. The

351

case load data from St. Vincent’s hospital demonstrated an increase in hospitalized COVID-19

352

cases over time, and our qPCR data correlates with this trend, indicating that with more

353

sampling, a predictive model could be developed and validated to identify an approximate

354

number of infected people present in the catchment over time. Using data from the ongoing

355

study, we are currently working to develop and validate candidate models.

356

Another highly discussed aspect of wastewater-based epidemiology is the degradation of

357

target viral RNA during its transit through the sewer system. While SARS-CoV-2 RNA is intact

358

enough at the inlet to the wastewater treatment plant for qPCR identification, sequencing

359

samples taken closer to the source, such as the effluent from a building or a neighborhood may

360

provide less degraded samples for whole genome sequencing, and therefore provide a better

361

representation of the viral mutations in circulation. In the future, we would like to compare RNA

362

quality of samples from different locations within a catchment to optimize viral sequencing.

363

1.5.1 Conclusions

364

This study has demonstrated that wastewater epidemiology at the local level can be used to

365

determine the viral load in a neighborhood or building and identify strain variants in circulation.

366

Total RNAseq from wastewater samples, while effective in identifying bacterial pathogens in

367

circulation, was not able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 for biosurveillance purposes, due to

368

the low abundance of the viral RNA in comparison with all other RNA in the sample. Therefore,

369

it is recommended that a combination of qPCR and targeted sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 be

370

utilized to track the pandemic and provide early warning of new strains circulating in the

371

population which could otherwise evade detection by diagnostics or indicate vaccine escape

372

mutants. The use of wastewater in to track mutations is limited by the methods to

373

bioinformatically deconvolute the viral sequences, and therefore in this work we presented the

374

mutations identified without separating the sequences into individual genomes. Future directions

375

will incorporate long read sequencing or linked read sequencing to enable deconvolution into

376

individual viral strains. Furthermore, a comparison of genomic sequences from samples at

377

wastewater treatment plants versus the local manholes utilized in this study would determine if

378

the time between viral shedding in waste and collection impacts viral RNA integrity limiting the

379

use of genomic sequencing to building or neighborhood wastewater samples for high quality full

380

genome sequences.
