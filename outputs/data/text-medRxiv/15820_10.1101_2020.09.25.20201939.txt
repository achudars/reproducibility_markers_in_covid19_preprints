Abstract

2

Background

3

As in many other settings, peak excess mortality preceded the officially reported ‘first wave’

4

peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus, Brazil, reflecting delayed case recognition and

5

limited initial access to diagnostic testing.

6

Methods and Findings

7

To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate

8

and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic’s trajectory and infer the cause of its decline

9

using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing

10

from mid-April 2020 due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model

11

that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a self-isolated

12

population fraction reduced the population-wide attack rate required to drop the effective

13

reproduction number below one from 62 % to 47 %, and reduced the final attack rate from 86%

14

to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained

15

susceptible to infection.

16

Conclusions

17

Our models indicate that the development of herd immunity amongst the mixing proportion of

18

the Manaus population had effectively halted the COVID-19 epidemic by late July 2020. Given

19

uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social

20

and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying

21

immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks

remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that

Introduction

25

Globally, marked differences have been observed in morbidity and mortality due to SARS-

26

CoV-2 infection. This variability mostly reflects the extent and timeliness of spontaneous and

27

imposed changes in social mixing and the sensitivity of surveillance systems to detect cases

28

and deaths [1]. Many countries that successfully constrained the initial epidemic through

29

distancing measures are now experiencing second waves in still-susceptible populations [2].

30

Estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2 in the range 2 to 6 [3, 4] suggest that population immunity

31

of approximately 50-80% is required to achieve herd protection. However, heterogeneous

32

behaviour, infectivity and immunity within subpopulations could plausibly decrease this

33

threshold to 10-20% [5]. Controversy remains regarding the extent of population exposure

34

required to achieve such constraint [6].

35

Comparison of population attack rates to inform this question is made challenging by

36

imperfect case ascertainment, compounded by limited diagnostics and overwhelmed health

37

systems, particularly in high incidence settings. Assessment of epidemic activity therefore

38

requires the use of less biased metrics than confirmed case reports. Excess mortality is an

39

objective measure which, with cause-of-death certification, can be used as an indicator of

40

direct and indirect COVID-19 associated mortality [7]. With hospitalisations data, it can

41

inform retrospective estimation of cumulative cases and deaths [8].

42

Brazil experienced a severe first wave of COVID-19 disease, with mass mortality reported in

43

many states, mainly in the north where seasonality of respiratory infections contributed to

44

higher vulnerability. A socialized health system provided free and global access to tertiary care

45

hospitals, but inequalities might explain different mortality rates in the population [9]. In

46

Manaus, the highly urbanised capital of Amazonas state, the first case of COVID-19 was

47

reported on 13 March 2020 [10]. By 11 August 2020, 37,597 cases and 2,051 deaths were

48

reported [11].

49

However, burial and death records indicate far higher mortality than official reports, suggesting

50

late recognition of importation and underreporting. Previous studies have assumed that the first

51

wave in Manaus was significantly mitigated by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [12].

52

While these restrictions may have partly constrained early transmission, local reports indicate

53

that implementation was highly variable [13]. Moreover, a possible role for immunity is

54

suggested by the observation of declining cases and deaths over a period in which restrictions

55

were officially eased.

56

We use death certificate and hospitalisation records to parameterise an epidemiological model

57

of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus. The model allows inference of age- and gender-

58

stratified infection-fatality ratios to explore evidence for development of herd immunity as a

59

driver of local epidemic resolution, with implications for the ongoing risk posed by SARS-

60

CoV-2 to this population.

61

Methods

62

Excess mortality and reported causes

63

Death certificate data from January 2015 to July 2020 were sourced from the Brazilian

64

Ministry of Health Mortality Information System (SIM). Information on age, gender, and

65

cause and date-of-death was recorded. Cause of death was reported using the World Health

66

Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10). The

67

2010 population census and the 2019 municipal population estimates were accessed from the

68

Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This project was approved by the

71

Background mortality was calculated by averaging the number of deaths observed per week,

72

commencing on January 1 each year, for the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Background

73

mortality was further stratified by gender and into 5-year age bands, culminating at 75+. For

74

each subgroup, we subtracted this five-year average from deaths observed for the period

75

between March 19 and June 24 of 2020 to determine excess deaths. This period was selected

76

as excess mortality was first observed in the week beginning on March 19 and the data returned

77

to baseline background mortality in the week beginning on June 25.

78

The age and gender structure reported in the 2010 population census was used to estimate the

79

2019 population size for each age and gender class. Population estimates were aggregated into

80

5-year age bands. The 5-year population estimates for 2019 were used to determine excess

81

mortality, as a proportion of the population.

82

The ICD-10 codes assigned to each death certificate were aggregated into 7 categories: diseases

83

of the respiratory system (J00-J99), circulatory system (I00-I99), endocrine system (E00-E99),

84

unattended (R98) and unknown cause of death (R99), coronavirus infection (B34.2) and all

85

remaining codes were categorised as ‘other’. All analyses were performed using R software.

86

Hospitalisation data

87

Hospitalisation data for patients admitted to all hospitals (private and public) in Manaus from

88

January 2020 to July 2020 was accessed from the Influenza Surveillance Information System

89

(SIVEP-Gripe). Data entry in this system is compulsory by law. A deidentified line list

90

included patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, investigations, clinical

91

management and outcome data.

92

Daily admissions to both hospital and intensive care units (ICU) were aggregated each week

93

in 2020 and stratified into 3 age bands (0-29, 30-64 and 65+). For each week, the proportion

94

of hospital and ICU admissions within each age group was determined. Between April and

95

July, the proportional distribution of hospital and ICU admissions across the three categories

96

remained fairly stable, with no evidence of rationing of service access on the basis of age.

97

Epidemiological model

98

We developed a stochastic, discrete-time, susceptible-infected-recovered epidemiological

99

model for Manaus which we calibrated using daily time-series data from the death-certificate

100

and hospitalisation records. The model assumed an initial population size equal to that of

101

Manaus in 2019 (2,182,761), which was split into N=36 age/gender groups based on

102

proportions reported in the 2010 census (i.e., 5-year age classes up to an age of 75 years, and

103

then a pooled age class for all individuals aged 75 years and over). To allow inference on the

104

background mortality rate in each age/gender group, the model was initiated on January 1,

105

2020, approximately two months prior to the introduction of COVID-19. The model was

106

terminated after n=202 days on July 20, 2020, to ensure complete reporting of both death

107

certificates and hospitalisations over the modelled period. The model detailed below was fitted

108

within a Bayesian framework using JAGS (v. 4.3.0) software [14] and a mixture of informative

109

and uninformative priors (for full details of the model code, including details of all prior

110

distributions, see Supplementary Appendix S1).

111

COVID-19 introduction and virus transmission. We initialised the model by allowing

112

importation of COVID-19 cases into Manaus over the week beginning March 5, 2020 (one

113

week before the first reported case), and inferred an importation model such that the number

114

of introduced cases into each group in each day of this first week arose from a Poisson process

115

with a common mean inferred from the data. To model community transmission, we inferred

116

a reproduction number on day t that was modified by an index of human mobility
𝑅𝑡 = 𝑒 (log(𝑅0) +

117

𝑎𝑋𝑡 )

(1)

118

where 𝑅0 is the basic reproduction number, 𝑋𝑡 is the mobility covariate and a is the inferred

119

coefficient. We derived the time-series 𝑋𝑡 by first averaging daily data for five separate indices

120

of community mobility (available as the mobility change relative to baseline for

121

retail/recreation, grocery/pharmacy, parks, transit stations and workplaces, accessed from

122

www.google.com/covid19/mobility), and then smoothed the series with a 7-day moving-

123

average smoother. We then assumed the effective reproduction number 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑓(𝑖,𝑗,𝑡) in group i due

124

to mixing with group j on day t is
𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑓(𝑖,𝑗,𝑡) = 𝑅𝑡 𝑄𝑖 𝑀𝑖,𝑗 𝑆𝑖,𝑡

125

(2)

126

where 𝑄𝑖 is the susceptibility of group i to infection, 𝑀𝑖,𝑗 is the rate of mixing between the two

127

groups, and 𝑆𝑖,𝑡 is the time-varying proportion of susceptible (previously uninfected)

128

individuals remaining in the focal group. Based on previous studies [15, 16], we used prior

129

means for the susceptibilities of 0-15, 15-60, and 60+ year old age classes of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.3,

130

respectively.

131

Mixing between groups was governed by an age-structured mixing matrix reported previously

132

for Brazil [17], which we corrected to be symmetrical (by averaging the upper and lower

133

triangles), scaled to a mean of 1/𝑁, and applied equally to both genders. The expected number

134

of new cases in each group each day was then calculated as

135

𝐶𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑁
𝑗=1 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑓(𝑖,𝑗,𝑡) (𝑐𝑗,1:(𝑡−1) ∙ 𝑔(𝑡−1):1 )

136

where 𝑐𝑗,1:(𝑡−1) is the case-history vector for group j and 𝑔(𝑡−1):1 is the portion of the generation

137

interval distribution relevant to those cases. We used the same generation interval distribution

138

as Mellan et al. [12] which concentrated >99% of an individual’s infectivity within the first 3

139

weeks of infection (median generation interval=5 days).

140

To account for heterogeneity in transmission, we assumed the offspring distribution in group i

141

due to mixing with infectious individuals from group j on day t was governed by a negative

142

binomial distribution with mean equal to 𝐶𝑖,𝑡 and variance equal to 𝐶𝑖,𝑡 (1 + 𝐶𝑖,𝑡 /∅𝑖,𝑡 ), where
∅𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑘𝐶𝑖,𝑡 /𝑅𝑡

143

(4)

144

and 𝑘 is the overdispersion parameter, such that smaller values of k represent greater

145

transmission heterogeneity (i.e., the more transmission is due to a small number of people,

146

including by so-called “superspreaders”). Given no previous study has documented strong

147

evidence of different susceptibility between genders, we first generated the expected number

148

of new cases in each age class (regardless of gender), and then assumed gender-specific cases

149

arose from a binomial distribution with probability equal to the proportion of the total

150

susceptible individuals for that age class attributable to each gender.

151

Background and COVID-induced mortality. We developed a model for the expected

152

number of deaths per day which was comprised of three components. First, we modelled the

153

background (pre-COVID-19) death rate 𝑑𝑖 estimated separately for each group. Second,

154

available data on the time from symptom onset to death for confirmed COVID-19 cases (from

155

the Manaus hospitalisation records) were used to infer a 4-parameter (𝑦0 , 𝑢min , 𝑢0 , 𝑏) mortality

156

distribution (𝑚) as a function of the time x since symptom onset (𝑥 ∈ {-5, …, N-5}) of the form

157

158

where 𝑎 is the average time from infection to symptoms, which was fixed at 5 days [3, 18, 19].

159

Finally, we modelled the infection-fatality ratio in each group 𝑖 (𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑖 ) as a log-linear function

160

of age and gender, with prior distributions on this components’ parameters based on a recent

161

meta-analysis of COVID-19-induced mortality [20]. Together, these components yielded the

162

following model for the expected number of deaths

163

𝐷𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑑𝑖 + 𝐼𝐹𝑅𝑖 ∑𝑁
𝑗=1(𝑐𝑗,1:(𝑡−1) ∙ 𝑚(𝑡−1):1 )

(6)

164

and the observed number of deaths each day was assumed to arise from a Poisson distribution

165

with mean equal to 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 .

166

Hospitalisations due to COVID-19. Hospitalisations were modelled in a similar way to

167

COVID-induced deaths, in that available data on the time from symptom onset to

168

hospitalisation were used to infer a 4-parameter hospitalisation distribution (ℎ) of the same

169

functional form as that used for the mortality distribution above. We modelled the infection-

170

hospitalisation ratio in each group 𝑖 (𝐼𝐻𝑅𝑖 ) as a logistic function of age and gender. Daily

171

hospitalisations were assumed to arise from a Poisson distribution with mean equal to

172

𝐻𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐼𝐻𝑅𝑖 ∑𝑁

173

Model scenarios. Given no data were available on whether some portion of the Manaus

174

population has been self-isolating since March 2020, we initially fitted a ‘baseline’ model to

175

death-certificate and hospitalisation data which assumed homogeneous age-structured mixing

176

across the entire Manaus population. We compared these model outcomes to those from a

177

second model that permitted a self-quarantined proportion (𝑃) of the population which could

178

not be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Communication with local experts including authors

179

on this paper suggested that more wealthy residents of Manaus had been able to greatly reduce

180

social interactions during the first epidemic wave and avoid exposure to the virus. We reviewed

181

detailed socio-demographic data on Manaus [21], but were not able to source quantitative

182

estimates of the relevant population fraction. However, we considered that this would not

183

exceed the upper 2 income quintiles (40%) of the population but was likely to be greater than

184

the wealthiest 10%, and accordingly, chose a non-informative uniform (0.1,0.4) prior on this

185

population fraction.

186

Herd-immunity threshold. To estimate the herd-immunity threshold for the baseline model

187

scenario, we calculated the discrete-time next-generation matrix from the mixing matrix and

188

posterior means for 𝑅0 and age-structured susceptibilities 𝑄. We then calculated the

189

deterministic reproduction number (𝑅) as the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix, and

190

estimated the herd-immunity threshold as 1 − 1⁄𝑅 . For each model, we also derived another

191

estimate of this threshold that incorporated the inferred age/sex distribution of cases, by

192

calculating the population-wide attack rate at which the expected number of offspring per case

193

(𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑓 multiplied by the normalised case-infectivity vector) fell below one.

194

Results

195

We calculated 3,457 excess deaths in Manaus, Brazil, between 19 March and 24 June 2020

196

(Supplementary Table 1) representing 0.16% of the city’s population. Males 30 years and over

197

experienced greater excess mortality than females; individuals aged 75 years or more

198

accounted for 39% of the excess (Fig 1A). During this period, 7% of the 75+ male population

199

in Manaus died (Fig 1B). COVID-19 deaths were first reported from 26 March and increased

200

weekly thereafter in keeping with improved access to diagnostics and/or increasing prevalence

201

(Fig 2), comprising 53% of the total excess. Other reported causes of death included respiratory

202

diseases, unattended and unknown causes of mortality, cardiovascular, endocrine and cancer-

203

related mortality, the majority of which were compatible [22] with a clinical diagnosis of

204

COVID-19 or are known comorbidities associated with severe outcomes (Fig 2).

205

Stochastic transmission models captured the observed peak in excess deaths in late April,

206

including age and gender variation (Fig 3, Figs S1 and S2). The models also captured

207

synchronous peaks in hospitalisations (Fig 3, Figs S3 and S4), although model fit to these data

208

was poorer, potentially reflecting delayed recognition of COVID-19 cases and/or capacity

209

exceedance during the epidemic peak.

210

Despite their different assumptions about the proportion of the Manaus population at risk, the

211

two model scenarios yielded equivalent fits to the data (Fig 3A, B). The baseline model

212

estimated heterogenous transmission (k=0.065 [0.047, 0.093], mean [95 % credible intervals]),

213

a mean time-to-death of 13 days (Fig S5), and inferred a population-wide attack rate of 85.7

214

[84.6, 86.7]% by 20 July. Attack rates were lowest in younger age classes (Fig 3A,i), reflecting

215

lower susceptibility assumed for people under 15 years.

216

Infection fatality rate (IFR) estimates for the baseline model ranged from almost zero for both

217

genders aged 30-35 years, to 3.0 [2.8, 3.3]% and 7.4 [6.8, 8.0]% for females and males over 75

218

years, respectively (Fig 4). At a population level, reduced mobility resulted in variable Rt, while

219

the expected offspring per case fell below one after April 12 (Fig S6), when the estimated

220

attack rate was 61.8 [61.1, 62.6]%. The traditional estimate of the herd-immunity threshold

221

based on the discrete-time next-generation matrix calculated from this model was 71.8 %.

222

Outcomes were similar for the second model which estimated 𝑄 = 24.5 [23.0, 25.1]% of the

223

Manaus population was effectively removed from the susceptible pool. Relative to the baseline

224

model, this second model estimated the expected offspring per case fell below one after April

Discussion

228

Early time-series modelling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazilian states up to 6 May 2020

229

used an unstructured model informed by state-level mobility indicators and reported deaths

230

[12]. The model inferred population attack rates ranging from 0.13% to 10.6%, for Minas

Gerais and Amazonas, respectively, and predicted ongoing epidemic growth throughout May.

232

Other modelled R0 estimates based on reported COVID-19 cases from Amazonas state have

233

similarly anticipated continued growth in cases through the month of June [13]. These models

234

could neither explain nor accurately forecast observations of epidemic decline in Manaus.

235

Our analysis of excess deaths and hospitalisations in Manaus identifies rapid epidemic growth

236

from late March, peaking in late April, with a return to baseline mortality in early June. These

237

age- and gender-stratified models inferred heterogeneous transmission consistent with previous

238

studies of SARS-CoV-1 [23] and SARS-CoV-2 [24]. In the baseline model, the expected

239

offspring per case fell below one at a population-wide attack rate of 61.8%. This model

240

suggests the herd-immunity threshold was exceeded in Manaus, with resulting attack rates

241

inferred to be 86% by July 20 2020. In contrast, the attack rate stabilised at 65 % for the second

242

model which estimated the risk of infection applied to c. 75% of the population only. Both

243

models suggest that, primarily due to herd protection, the expected number of offspring per

244

cases fell below one in early April.

245

Although both models estimated declining SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time due to herd

246

immunity, their implications for the possibility of subsequent waves are qualitatively different.

247

Although there are currently no data to support the assertion that some fraction of the Manaus

248

population self-isolated, we consider the second model is likely more realistic because: (1) the

249

estimated infection-fatality ratios are higher than reported from high-income countries [25]

250

which we anticipate to be plausible; and (2) a population attack rate of 65% is more consistent

251

with recent estimates based on a Manaus blood bank serosurvey [26] which reported the largest

252

increase in seropositivity over the month of April.

253

We focus on Manaus as the epicentre of the COVID-19 epidemic in Amazonas, avoiding

254

conflation of case numbers in this dense city of more than 2 million people with slower

255

growing rural outbreaks across the state [6]. Given known information bias associated with

256

limited early testing capacity, we used excess deaths and hospitalisations as the most

257

objective indicators of epidemic activity presently available. Detailed cause-of-death data

258

support the hypothesis that the majority of excess mortality over this time was COVID-19

259

related.

260

An important caveat is that estimated attack rates accumulate all infections and are agnostic to

261

the presence or degree of symptoms. Severity of the clinical course of COVID-19 is associated

262

with magnitude and persistence of the host immune response [27]. In consequence, our

263

estimates of ‘exposure’ cannot be directly related to predicted antibody seroprevalence at the

264

end of the first wave [28]. It is reasonably anticipated that population immunity will wane over

265

time, requiring robust memory responses [29] to prevent reinfection or modify the clinical

266

course [30].

267

Our findings support emerging evidence that population heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2

268

transmission, attributable to a range of biological and sociological factors, reduces the herd

269

immunity threshold [24, 31, 32]. Reduction of superspreading events through constraints on

270

mixing group sizes is concordant with genomic studies showing successive extinction of

271

imported strains under the influence of social and mobility restrictions [33].

272

While future infection clusters and outbreaks remain possible in Manaus due to unexposed

273

subgroups, population-level immunity will likely constrain widespread transmission unless

274

immunity wanes. As in other settings, underlying vulnerability of older age groups may be

275

further exacerbated over time by reduced health seeking behaviours of individuals with pre-

276

existing and new medical conditions [34]. Social measures should be informed by

277

understanding of key enablers of superspreading and amplification, awareness of at-risk

278

populations and tailored to context depending on population experience of the first wave.

279

Excess mortality data are not sufficiently timely to support real-time decision making, but in

280

areas with limited testing may be a more reliable indicator of past epidemic activity than

281

confirmed cases. To accurately support response to and assess the impact of the COVID-19

282

and other public health emergencies, improved access to diagnostics, and strengthening of

283

reporting systems are needed in low- and middle-income settings. Cross-sectional and

284

longitudinal seroprevalence studies are essential to understand markers and maintenance of

285

immunity to inform prediction of long-term epidemiologic trends and bridging to likely vaccine

286

impacts [26, 35].

the (A) mortality distribution and (B) hospitalisation distribution, as a function of time since

454

infection. Vertical bars indicate empirical frequencies derived from hospitalisation records

455

for Manaus. In (A), the dashed line indicates the mortality distribution used by a previous

Fig S6. Estimates from the baseline model (mean ± 95 % credible intervals) of: (A) the

459

impact of personal mobility on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt); and (B) the

460

population-level effective reproduction number (Reff) over time, which here is calculated as

461

the sum of the products of all 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑓(𝑖,𝑗,𝑡) and the normalised case-infectivity vectors at each

462

time t. In the latter, Reff rises initially as the case distribution converges on the stable

463

distribution, and Reff < 1 indicates the switch to negative epidemic growth due to the

464

development of herd immunity.
