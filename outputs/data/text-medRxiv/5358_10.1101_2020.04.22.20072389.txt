Abstract
Many countries are currently in a lockdown state due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. One key aspect to
transition safely out of lockdown is to continuously test the population for infected subjects. Currently,
detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), and
requires dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on Reverse
Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. This
protocol is applied directly on SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step
required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared its results to the
standard method. We further succeeded to apply the protocol on self-sampled saliva from confirmed
cases. Since the proposed protocol provides results on-the-spot, and can detect SARS-CoV-2 from
saliva, it can allow simple and continuous surveillance of the community.

Introduction
During a pandemic, surveillance is crucial for minimizing viral spread. The common and approved
detection method worldwide requires professional experience in sampling, performing the reaction
and analyzing the results. Moreover, it requires dedicated machines, and chemical reagents as well as
sophisticated sample collection and transport logistics. Due to these laborious and cumbersome
requirements, the number of detection tests per day is limited, and many patients in the community
are not sampled, let alone sampled frequently. Such limited surveillance necessitates global and strict
quarantine requirements, which threaten the global economy.
Detection is key. We believe that a simple and easy detection method, preferably one that can be
performed and interpreted on-the-spot could relieve some of the current limitations, and help
execute an efficient and safe exit strategy from lockdowns. Fast and simple serological tests that can,
in principle, be applied in households, are being developed [1]. However, anti-viral antibodies can be
detected only several days after the infection onset, and can persist even after clearance of the virus.
A stage at which the patient is not contagious anymore [2]. Hence, the presence of antibodies detected
in such home-kits are an indirect indication on previous viral exposure. These tests do not account to
the actual viral load—a critical parameter for minimizing the spread.
Detection of viral nucleic acids in patients is the gold standard detection method to date. It is currently
performed at hospitals by professionals. As opposed to antibodies, detection of the viral RNA is a
direct measure for the contagiousness of the patient. At this stage of the current COVID-19 pandemic,
it is clear that the availability and throughput of standard methods for viral nucleic acid detection is
limited both by resources and accessibility to the community.
Standard detection methods for viral RNA in patients include RNA purification, reverse transcription
and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). These processes are time consuming, require multiple biochemical
reagents, lab-grade instruments and trained professionals [3]. Fortunately, to date, alternative
molecular biology methods can overcome these limitations. One of these methods is colorimetric
Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) [4]. LAMP is performed at a single and constant
temperature allows a one-step reverse transcription and its results can be visualized by color change
(for graphical presentation see Fig. 1a). Due to the need for reverse transcription, this method is called
reverse-transcribed (RT)-LAMP. Altogether, these advantages eliminate the need for sophisticated lab
equipment [5-7]. Here, we adjusted RT-LAMP for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from clinical
diagnostic swabs of human patients, without RNA purification steps. The primers we used were
previously designed and validated by Zhang et al. [4] (see primers table). We studied samples from
positive and negative patients for the SARS-CoV-2. The samples were confirmed by approved RNA
purification and quantification at the Rambam Health Care Campus (RHCC) hospital.

Results
Optimal conditions of colorimetric RT-LAMP SARS-CoV-2 detection
We first applied RT-LAMP on purified RNA from COVID-19 positive and negative swabs. As in Zhang et.
al., [4] the RT-LAMP results agreed with the standard RT-qPCR results (Fig. 1b). To simplify the detection
method, we sought to test the RT-LAMP reaction on clinical diagnostic throat and nose swabs from
patients. These swabs were kept in universal transfer media (UTM). To these samples, we added an
inactivation step by heating the UTM to 95°C for 5 minutes. Inactivated samples from confirmed
patients were found to be positive by the RT-LAMP reaction (Fig. 1c). We then evaluated this RT-LAMP
protocol on a cohort of 99 patients that were tested at the hospital. This pool included 27 positive
samples with a wide range of viral load and 72 negative samples. Samples were previously evaluated
by the standard RT-qPCR test. The detection limit of this RT-LAMP protocol was at cycle threshold (Ct)
of 27.8 (Fig. 1d, Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table 1), with 7 true positives (TP), 20 false negatives (FN),
72 true negatives (TN), and no false positives (FP) (Fig. 1e, Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table 1).
Although there were no false positives, the rate of TP was very low. Hence, we were interested to
improve the RT-LAMP protocol of detection from clinical diagnostic patient swabs. Since these swab
samples may contain enzymatic inhibitors that might affect the efficiency of viral RNA detection, we
have tested the addition of proteinase K and guanidine hydrochloride to the process. Proteinase K was
added to the UTM sample taken from the original tube, and guanidine hydrochloride to the RT-LAMP
reaction step. We first compared the two protocols on eight patients with low, medium and high Cts.
Out of seven patients with positive results of RT-qPCR (Ct<37), two were clearly RT-LAMP positive in
the former protocol and four in the new protocol. We concluded that these adjustments improved
the RT-LAMP efficiency of viral RNA detection directly from clinical diagnostic swab samples (fig. 1f).
Lastly, we tested samples from patients confirmed to be infected with viruses other than SARS-CoV2. We tested a few patients that were previously confirmed to be infected by other viruses (HSV, RSV,
Influenza and Enterovirus). As shown in figure 1g, this RT-LAMP reaction was negative for patients
infected with these viruses, and positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Adjusted protocol on cohort of 83 suspected patients
With this adjusted protocol, we set to validate it on an additional cohort of 83 patients suspected of
SARS-CoV-2. These patients were tested at RHCC by the standard RT-qPCR, 31 were negative and 52
were positive with a wide range of Ct values (14-35). We were interested in finding the optimal
incubation time to yield the best rate of true positives without increasing the rate of false negatives.
We performed the RT-LAMP reaction for up to 40 minutes, and evaluated the colorimetric results at
time-points 30, 35 and 40 minutes. With time, the number of TP increased, the number of FN
decreased, with no change in the numbers of TN and with one FP throughout (Fig. 2a, b, Fig. S2 and
Supplementary Table 2). Time-points 35 and 40 showed the highest TP rate in samples with low
(Ct<26) and medium (26<Ct<29) Ct values (Fig. 2d, Fig. Supplementary Table 2). Hence, in these
conditions, time-points 35 and 40 were better altogether. Figure 2c shows the results of the adjusted
method at time point 40. These results were compared to the RT-qPCR Ct values of the same patients.
RT-LAMP was most sensitive in detection of positive patients with viral load that corresponds to low

and medium Ct values. Under Ct 28.8, the true positive rate of RT-LAMP was 93%. Test results were
interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard.

Applying RT-LAMP protocol on saliva samples from confirmed patients
Human to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly through saliva droplets [8]. A comparison
between saliva samples to the standard swabs showed a higher viral load in the saliva [9]. Moreover,
the FDA has recently approved saliva as a possible way of sampling for COVID-19
(https://www.fda.gov/media/136875/download). Therefore, we next performed RT-LAMP on human
saliva samples. Saliva samples were self-collected from three different confirmed patients, and one
suspected negative subject. In parallel, we also performed the standard RNA purification and RT-qPCR
reactions in the hospital setting. The confirmed patients were found positive in both RT-LAMP and RTqPCR from saliva, and the suspected negative subject was confirmed negative (Fig. 3a). Here, as a
positive control for the reaction and saliva sampling, we tested for the human gene POP7, in addition
to gene N of SARS-CoV-2. POP7 was detected in all saliva samples (Fig. 3a).
Due to the isothermal property of the reaction and the fact that the test is detectable in saliva samples,
the reaction can potentially be performed in any constant heat source. Self-sampling can be done in
a thermal-cup as shown in (Fig. 3b).

Discussion
RT-LAMP is a rapid and simple method to detect purified RNA of SARS-CoV-2 [4]. In this study, we were
interested to test its potential as a direct detection method for viral presence in suspected COVID-19
patients. To do so, we adjusted and validated the RT-LAMP protocol for direct detection from clinical
diagnostic patient swab samples. Our experiments were performed side-by-side to the standard RTqPCR method at the hospital. We compared RT-qPCR Ct values to the RT-LAMP results of more than
180 different patients. Upon calibration, this direct RT-LAMP method successfully detected patients
with medium to high viral loads, while yielding very few false-positives.
We demonstrate the optimal protocol for immediate off-the-shelf use of RT-LAMP on COVID-19
patients in the current pandemic. This protocol does not include RNA purification step. Besides a
constant heat source, (e.g. a thermal mug), no sophisticated equipment is required. This protocol
takes about an hour from sampling to detection, with very few reagents, and can potentially be
performed by non-professionals or self-performed. These features allow its implementation around
the globe, including in rural areas.
The next development steps required before clinical application are further adjustment of the protocol
on saliva samples, tested on a large cohort, and compared to the standard method. Upon such further
development, such a SARS-CoV-2 detection method can be applied as a surveillance tool for sampling
larger populations of the community. Its simplicity, availability of products and low cost, makes it easy
to continuously monitor suspected subjects. With further development, this method can be applied
to medical clinics, points of entry, nursing homes, workplaces, etc. Importantly, this method can be
easily adjusted to other emerging pathogens as well.

Methods:
Samples collection:
Swabs from both throat and nose were previously collected to one tube by healthcare providers and
sent to the Virology laboratory at the Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel. The swabs were
stored in 1-2 ml of Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Saliva samples were self-collected directly into
sterile cups, and kept at 4 °C until tested.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR):
Viral RNA was extracted by either of three automated nucleic acid extraction systems: (1) easyMAG ®
/ EMAG (Biomeriuex); (2) magLEAD® 5bL (Precision System Science); (3) MagEx (STARlet) using the
following protocols: (1) 2 ml lysis buffer, 0.5 ml sample and 50 μl elution buffer; (2) 270 μl lysis buffer,
130 μl sample and 50 μl elution buffer; (3) 300 μl lysis buffer, 400 μl sample and 50 μl elution buffer,
respectively. Following viral RNA extraction, RT-qPCR was performed using either of two commercial
kits: (1) Allplex™ 2019-nCoV (Seegene); (2) Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for Detecting SARS-2019nCoV (BGI), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Additional RT-qPCR reaction mix was created
manually, using custom made primers (Primers table) as follows: The probe IC was synthesized with a
5' FAM/CY5 Fluorophore moiety and 3' ZEN/IBFQ quencher. Each of the manual reactions was
assembled in a total volume of 25 µl. 12.5µl 2X Ag-Path One-step mix (Ambion), 1 µl primers, 1µl of
Reverse Transcriptase enzyme, 5 µl of the sample’s RNA extracted previously and H2O to a final volume
of 25 µl. All RT-qPCR reactions were executed in either of two systems: (1) Quantstudio (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.) or (2) CFX96 RealTime PCR machines (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 30
minutes at 50 °C, 10 minutes at 95 °C and 45 cycles of two-step incubations: (1) 15 seconds at 95 °C ;
(2) 30 seconds at 55 °C. Fluorescence was measured during step 2 of each cycle.
Colorimetric RT-LAMP Reaction:
5 μl of UTM samples were diluted in 40 μl of DNase RNase free water (Biological Industries, 01-8691B) and 2 μl of Proteinase K (1.22 mg/ml final concentration) (Seegene, 744300.4.UC384). Samples
were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Inactivation of proteinase K was obtained by
incubating the reaction tubes at 95 °C for 5 minutes. Next, colorimetric RT-LAMP reaction was
performed in a total volume of 20 µl per reaction using 10 µl WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master
Mix (New England BioLabs Inc., M1800), 2 µl primers mix (see Primers Table), 1 µl Guanidine
hydrochloride (Sigma, G4505), to a final concentration of 40 mM, and 7 µl of the inactivated sample.
The reaction was then incubated for 30-40 minutes at 65 °C. The proteinase K inactivation step and
the reaction step were performed in a closed lid heating-block or, for a proof of concept, in a thermoscup, using warm water. In the case of a thermos-cup, temperature was monitored by a simple
thermometer. After 20 minutes of incubation, samples were monitored for color change every 5
minutes, by the naked eye, until reaching 40 min incubation. Samples were considered negative if the
original pink color of the phenol red was maintained and positive if the phenol red color turned
orange-yellow.

Fig. 3: Applying the RT-LAMP protocol on saliva samples.
a, RT-LAMP tests on saliva from 4 volunteers. Each tube represents one tested volunteer. Results of
t=0 and t=35 are shown. Upper panel, RT-LAMP reaction using POP7 primers as a positive control.
Middle panel, RT-LAMP reaction with no primers control. Lower panel, RT-LAMP reaction using SARSCoV-2 gene N primers. The same samples were analyzed by the conventional hospital RT-qPCR
protocol. The RT-qPCR results and Ct values are shown under the relevant samples. b, Graphical
illustration of the potential of RT-LAMP protocol to perform self-saliva testing.
