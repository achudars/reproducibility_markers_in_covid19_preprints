ABSTRACT
Objectives: To assess physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients who adhered or
not to social distancing measures due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our secondary aim
was to compare physical activity estimates between objectively measured and selfreported physical activity level.
Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we assessed physical activity level
using accelerometers and a validated questionnaire in 33 post-bariatric patients who
reported to be adherent (n=15) or not (n=18) to social distancing measures.
Results: Patients adherent to social distancing measures spent more time in sedentary
behavior (1.1 hours/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-tovigorous physical activity (-12.2 min/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to
non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for light-intensity physical activity.
Bland-Altman analysis comparing objective and subjective physical activity estimates
showed a bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity of 2.8 hours/day and 8.5 min/day, respectively.
Conclusion: Post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing measures
due to the Covid-19 outbreak were more inactive and sedentary than non-adherent ones.
Additionally, questionnaire data widely underestimated sedentary behavior. Strategies
to increase or at least sustain physical activity levels in post-bariatric patients exposed to
social distancing measures are necessary during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity (1), resulting in
substantial weight loss, remission of type 2 diabetes (2), and improved overall
cardiometabolic profile (3). Weight loss often peaks 1 year following bariatric surgery,
and then it is commonly followed by a partial and gradual weight regain after 2 years
(3). However, when physical activity is increased during the post-surgery period,
patients may exhibit a superior initial weight loss and long-term weight maintenance
(4), which is paralleled by sustained improvements in cardiometabolic health (5).
Despite the acknowledged benefits of increasing physical activity in the post-surgery
period, most patients remain physically inactive and sedentary (6).
As of March 24, 2020, Sao Paulo government adopted a set of social distancing
measures (including a “stay-at-home” order) to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. In this
scenario, one could expect increases in physical inactivity and sedentary behavior due to
social distancing exposure, a condition that could deteriorate the overall health of
patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.
To shed light on this, we assessed physical activity levels in post-bariatric
patients who reported to be adherent or not to social distancing during the Covid-19
pandemic. As a secondary objective, we compared physical activity estimates between
objective and self-reported methods. Our hypotheses were as follows: (i) patients who
were adherent to social distancing would be more inactive and sedentary compared to
those who were non-adherent; (ii) self-reported physical activity would show poor
agreement with objective estimates (by accelerometer).

Experimental design and participants
We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Data were collected between
April 20 and July 9, 2020, period in which the social distancing measures were in place
in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Thirty-three patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were
recruited from the outpatient Bariatric Surgery Clinic (Clinical Hospital, School of
Medicine, University of Sao Paulo). Inclusion criteria were as follows: being ≥ 18 years
old, having a surgery elapsed time ≤ 12 months, and not presenting with any Covid-19
symptoms.
Patients were asked about compliance with social distancing measures by phone
interview. They were considered to be “adherent” when they answered “I always
comply with social distancing” (n=15), whereas those who answered “I never comply
with social distancing” or “I sporadically comply with social distancing” (n=18) were
considered to be “non-adherent”.
This trial was approved by the local ethical committee. Patients signed an
informed consent form prior to participation.

Physical activity level
Physical activity level was measured using ActiGraph GT3X® accelerometers
(ActiGraph, Pensacola, Florida) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(IPAQ) short version.
All participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer for 7 days during
waking hours, except when bathing, on a belt on the right side of the waistline. Data

were exported in 60-s epochs using ActiLife 6 software, v. 6.11.9, and analyzed
following standard criteria (7). Freedson cut-points were used to classify epochs in
sedentary time (<100 counts/min), light-intensity physical activity (≥ 100 and <1952
counts/min), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (≥1952 counts/min) (8).
Sedentary time was reported as total time per day and also accrued in bouts ≥ 30 min.
Data was adjusted to a wear time of 16 hours/day to avoid bias due to differences in
wear time among participants.
We administered the IPAQ short version through a phone call interview. The
IPAQ short form, which enquires about physical activity and sedentary time in the past
seven days. Time spent per day in each activity was calculated as the number of days
multiplied by the number of hours reported for each activity and then averaged to seven
days. A Brazilian validated version of the questionnaire was used in this study (9).

Statistical analysis
Dependent variables were tested using independent-sample T-tests. BlandAltman technique was used to calculate the bias and limits of agreement between
accelerometer and IPAQ for sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,
using Graph Pad Prism 7. Of note, we decided not to use the Bland-Altman analysis for
light-intensity physical activity because IPAQ assesses walking activities exclusively,
which certainly underestimates time spent in the light-intensity domain. Data are
presented as mean (95% confidence intervals [95%CI]) or absolute and relative
frequency (n[%]). Significance level was set at p≤0.05.

Patients were 48.1 years (44.3, 52.0) and 27 (81.8%) were women. Twenty-five
(75.8%) and 8 (24.2%) underwent Y-in-Roux gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy
surgery, respectively. Post-operative time was 7.1 months (6.2, 8.0) and body mass
index was 35.7 kg/m2 (33.3, 38.1). Fifteen patients were classified as adherent and 18 as
non-adherent to social distancing.
Patients who were adherent to social distancing spent more time in sedentary
behavior (1.1 hours/day [95%CI: 0.1, 2.2]; p=0.045) and less time in moderate-tovigorous physical activity (-12.2 min/day [95%CI: -23.8, -0.6]; p=0.040) compared to
non-adherent ones. No difference was observed for prolonged sitting ≥30 min (0.6
hours/day [95%CI: -0.2, 1.5]; p=0.147) and light-intensity physical activity (-0.9
hours/day [95%CI: -1.9, 0.1]; p=0.80). Only three (20%) patients were classified as
physically active among those who were adherent to social distancing, whereas 8
(44.4%) were classified as physically active among non-adherent ones.
Grouping all patients, mean time spent in sedentary behavior, light-intensity
physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were 9.5 hours/day (9.0,
10.1), 6.1 hours/day (5.6, 6.7), and 19.5 min/day (12.7, 26.3), respectively.
Questionnaire data showed that patients spent 4.8 hours/day (3.8, 5.9) in sedentary
behavior, 0.2 hours/day (0.1, 0.4) walking, and 8.3 min/day (1.6, 15.0) in moderate-tovigorous physical activity. Bias for time spent in sedentary behavior and moderate-tovigorous physical activity were 2.8 hours/day (-2.8, 8.4; Figure 2, panel A) and 8.5
min/day (-28.5, 45.6; Figure 2, panel B), respectively. Bias did not differ between
patients who were adherent or non-adherent to social distancing (data not shown).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess physical activity levels using
validated accelerometers in post-bariatric patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our
main findings suggest that post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing
were more inactive and sedentary than those who were non-adherent. Physical inactivity
and sedentary behavior are potential risk factors that could deteriorate cardiometabolic
health in post-bariatric patients and is of particular importance to those exposed to
social distancing measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The data showing that patients exposed to social distancing spent less time in
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and more time in sedentary behavior suggest that
the set of social distancing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has come at
detriment of physical activity. Inactivity and sedentary behavior associate with chronic
diseases and all-cause mortality (10, 11). Even short-term exposure (14 days) to
inactivity and sedentariness results in metabolic dysfunction, muscle wasting, fat
accumulation, and impaired physical capacity in healthy individuals (12). In patients
who have undergone bariatric surgery, the repercussion of physical inactivity and
sedentary behavior during the post-operative period is underexplored; however, higher
physical activity has been associated with better cardiometabolic risk factors (5).
Furthermore, exercise training has been shown to improve insulin resistance (13),
vascular function (14), and inflammatory markers (14), and attenuate the loss of bone
and muscle mass (15, 16). Thus, increasing physical activity could be a key strategy to
improve overall health among post-bariatric patients and are confined during the
pandemic.

Physical activity questionnaires are commonly used due to their easy-of-use and
low cost. However, questionnaires might be misleading due to their poor validity and
reliability (17). When compared to objectively measured physical activity, individuals
usually overreport their time spent in physical activity (18), whereas underreport
sedentary time (19), which seems to be more pronounced among individuals with
obesity (18). To our knowledge, our study was the first to compare sedentary behavior
data between objective and self-reported tools in post-bariatric patients. Patients
underreported their sedentary time by 2.8 hours/day (29.5%), concurring with data from
a recent meta-analysis (19). Interestingly, however, our patients underreported
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by 8.5 min/day (42.9%), contrasting with
previous literature (18, 20). Due to the expected difficulty of collecting objective
physical activity data during the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers might be inclined to
use questionnaires. However, healthcare professionals and police-makers should
exercise caution when interpreting these data as the agreement of self-reported and
objective methods is widely poor, as evidenced by the current study.
The main strength of this study is the concomitant use of validated
accelerometer and questionnaire, which allowed characterizing physical activity as well
as identifying the limitation of assessing physical activity using subjective methods
during the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the comparison between patients who were
adherent and non-adherent to social measures enhances our ability to establish
causation. The limitations of this study include the reduced sample size and the crosssectional nature of the study, which hampers a definitive conclusion on the causal effect
of social distancing on physical activity.
In conclusion, post-bariatric patients who were adherent to social distancing to
contain the Covid-19 pandemic were more inactive and sedentary than those who were

non-adherent. Given the increased burden of cardiovascular diseases related to
inactivity and sedentary behavior, strategies to increase physical activity level in postbariatric patients, particularly those exposed to social distancing, are of emergent need
during the Covid-19 pandemic.
