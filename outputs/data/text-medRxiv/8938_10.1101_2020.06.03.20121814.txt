ABSTRACT

To explore the variation in understanding, attitudes and uptake of COVID-19
health advice during the 2020 pandemic lockdown by health literacy.
Objectives:

Study design:

Setting:

National cross sectional community survey.

Australian general public.

Participants:

Adults aged over 18 years (n=4362).

Knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to COVID-19; health
literacy and socio-demographic factors.
Main outcome measures:

People with inadequate health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19
symptoms (49% vs 68%; p<0.001), were less able to identify behaviours to prevent infection
(59% vs 72%; p<0.001), and experienced more difficulty finding information and
understanding government messaging about COVID-19 than people with adequate health
literacy. They were less likely to rate social distancing as important (6.1 vs 6.5, p<0.001) and
reported more difficulty remembering/accessing medication since lockdown (3.6 vs 2.7,
p<0.001). Importantly there was higher endorsement of misinformation beliefs related to
COVID-19 and vaccination in people with lower health literacy. Similar results were
observed among people who primarily speak a language other than English at home.
Results:

: Our findings show important disparities by health literacy and language in
COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that have the potential to
undermine efforts to reduce viral transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health
outcomes in Australia. Those with the greatest burden of chronic disease are most
disadvantaged, and most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19.
Addressing the health literacy needs of the community in public health messaging about
COVID-19 must now be a priority in Australia.
Conclusion

INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus pandemic represents the biggest public health challenge Australia and the
world have faced in living memory. Because COVID-19 spreads so rapidly, the pandemic has
placed unprecedented strain on health systems globally. People at greater risk of a severe
response to COVID-19 include those aged over 60 years, in aged care facilities, with
compromised immune systems (e.g. cancer) and those with chronic medical conditions (1).
Although data is still emerging, it suggests that people with chronic disease and
multimorbidity are particularly susceptible (2). There are well known social inequalities in
chronic disease with higher rates in more disadvantaged populations. Perhaps predictably,
evidence of large disparities in COVID-19 deaths by ethnicity and socioeconomic groups has
emerged in the US and UK (2, 3).
Currently there are no proven antiviral treatments and no vaccine. This means that to
control the spread of COVID-19 we are largely reliant on individual behaviour to comply
with restrictions and follow recommended advice on behaviours such as physical distancing,
voluntary testing, self-isolation, and hand hygiene. Lockdown measures can enforce some of
these behaviours, for example, by restricting travel, requiring returning travellers to selfisolate, closure of public recreational spaces, dramatically limiting individual contacts, and
an extensive shift to attend work or school remotely. These combined efforts to slow the
spread of COVID-19 have had notable success in Australia. However, different levels of
engagement with these lockdown measures within our community may lead to hotspots or
even a second wave, and certain groups may be more severely affected by COVID-19.
Since an effective response to the virus requires individuals to modify their behaviour, their
engagement with public health information is a pivotal element. This has meant being able
to process and understand rapidly evolving public health messages, and then actioning
them. It is well known that people vary in their ability to understand, access and action
health advice and make informed health decisions –a set of skills commonly called “health
literacy”(4). Health literacy has emerged as one of the strongest psychosocial determinants
of health outcomes and explains a range of health inequalities by age, ethnicity and
socioeconomic position (5). Concern about the quality and appropriateness of
communication for people with lower health literacy, and for other vulnerable population
subgroups early on in the lockdown campaign, has been expressed (6). This was alongside

widespread concern about inconsistent messaging (e.g. on sending children to school) and
lack of clarity over key preventive behavioural advice (physical distancing).
We set out to explore the understanding, uptake and impact of COVID-19 health advice
during the 2020 pandemic lockdown among a diverse national sample. Our aim was to
understand if vulnerable populations might be further disadvantaged in their understanding
and attitudes regarding COVID-19 prevention measures. We examined variation in
knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and psychosocial outcomes by health literacy and key
sociodemographic factors.

METHODS

Setting:
The survey was carried out in collaboration with a sister survey conducted in the United
States in March (7)(Wolf et al 2020). The adapted Australian version of the survey was
conducted between April 17 -22 2020, when lockdown had been in place for 3 weeks.
th

nd

Study design:
A cross-sectional survey was conducted using the online platform Qualtrics. This study was
approved by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2020/212).
Participants:
Participants were aged 18 years and over, able to read and understand English and currently
residing in Australia. Participants were recruited via social media (Facebook and Instagram)
and Dynata, a large market research company with over 600,000 online panel members.
Participants recruited via social media were given the opportunity to enter into a prize draw
for the chance to win one of ten $20 gift cards upon completion of the survey. Participants
recruited via Dynata received points for completing the survey, which can be redeemed for
gift vouchers, donations to charities or money.

Measurements:
Sociodemographic variables including age, gender, educational status, employment status,
country of birth, area of residence, number in household, primary language spoken at
home, and self-identification as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander were collected. In
addition, health insurance status, self-reported chronic diseases and self-reported overall
health were obtained. Changes in consumption of unhealthy snacks and alcohol intake was
assessed (8). We assessed health literacy using Health Literacy single item screener (8) and
eHealth Literacy Scale (eHeals) (9), and numeracy using the Subjective Numeracy Scale (10).
The Consumer Health Activation Index (CHAI) was used to determine patient activation (11).
Anxiety and depression were measured using self-reported history of anxiety, depression
and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (12). Participants were asked to indicate their
awareness and concerns (7), perceived financial impact (13), knowledge, sources of
information, personal preparedness (14), behaviour change, daily impact and support for
misinformation of COVID-19 (15) (Box 1 in the Appendix lists the items).
Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all participant characteristics (Table 1) and study
outcome measures (Supplementary Table S1). Associations between key participant
characteristics (see Tables 1-2) and outcomes were examined in univariable analyses using
Χ tests, t-tests, or analysis of variance (as appropriate). To explore variation in outcomes by
health literacy adequacy, multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate
marginal means (with 95% confidence intervals) for continuous outcomes, and generalised
linear models with a modified Poisson approach (16) to estimate relative risks (with 95%
confidence intervals) for dichotomous outcomes. All multivariable models controlled for age
group, gender, number of chronic health conditions, language spoken at home, private
health insurance status, and employment status. Statistical analyses were conducted in
Stata/IC v16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).
2

Sample size was calculated to achieve a specified level of precision in estimates at a 6month assessment in the prospective cohort, accounting for potential loss to follow-up with
each assessment wave.

RESULTS

We had a total of 4,362 respondents. Sample characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The
mean age was 42.6 years (SD 17.4; range: 18-90 years) with 60% female respondents. Most
participants (75%) were born in Australia, with 94% speaking English as their primary
language at home, 35% had no tertiary qualifications and 36% did not have private health
insurance. The presence of at least one chronic health condition was reported by 48% of the
sample. Inadequate health literacy (assessed by the SILS) was reported by 13% of the
sample.

COVID-19 Awareness and Concern

Awareness and concern about COVID-19 across sample demographics are shown in Table 2.
Notably, older participants (aged 56 to 90 years) rated the seriousness of the threat of
COVID-19 as higher than younger participants, but also reported being less nervous, had
lower anxiety, and a greater proportion believed they were not likely to get sick than in
younger age groups. The perceived seriousness of the threat also increased with number of
chronic health conditions reported. Participants who reported speaking a language other
than English (LOTE) at home rated the threat of COVID-19 lower, with a greater proportion
indicating that they were not likely to get sick compared to those who primarily spoke
English at home.

Multivariable analyses examining differences in outcomes by health literacy after adjusting

for other sociodemographic variables are displayed in Table 3 (full model estimates are

provided in Supplementary Tables S2-S5). Compared to participants with adequate health

literacy, individuals with inadequate health literacy rated the seriousness of the threat to be

significantly lower (p<0.001), had higher anxiety (p<0.001), and reported COVID-19 to have

a greater impact on their financial situation (p<0.001). Participants with inadequate health

literacy were more likely (p=0.018) to think that they would not get sick from COVID-19

compared to participants with adequate health literacy.

COVID-19 knowledge and information
On average, participants estimated that 61.3% of people who get COVID-19 will have only

mild symptoms, and that approximately 6.5% of people who are infected with COVID-19 in

Australia will die as a result (Supplementary Table S1). Most participants (60%) were able to

provide at least three key symptoms of COVID-19, and more than two-thirds of the sample

(71%) could describe three government-recommended prevention methods. Differences in

knowledge of symptoms and preventative measures by sociodemographic factors are

shown in Table 2. After controlling for other sociodemographic factors, participants with

inadequate health literacy were significantly less likely (p<0.001) to be able to name three

key symptoms of COVID-19, and less likely to be able to report three preventative methods

(p<0.001).

Participants reported spending on average 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) per day getting news or

learning about COVID-19. The three most frequently endorsed sources of information were

public television (67.6%), social media (64.4%) and government websites (63.9%).

Sociodemographic disparities in understanding government messaging was evident (Table

2); younger participants, females, those with inadequate health literacy, poorer general

health, primarily speaking English at home, and those without private health insurance

reporting greater difficulty understanding. After adjusting for other sociodemographic

factors, individuals with inadequate health literacy reported significantly more difficulty

(p<0.001) understanding government messaging in relation to COVID-19.

Behaviour change and impact
Changes to plans due to COVID-19 were reported by the vast majority (92%) of the sample,

with 84% agreeing that COVID-19 has impacted their daily routine. Only 9% of the total

sample felt “not at all” personally prepared for widespread outbreak of COVID-19.

Compared to before the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions, 26% reported drinking more

alcohol, and 37% reported eating more unhealthy snacks. Variations in behaviour change

and impact as a function of sociodemographic factors are shown in Table 2.

After controlling for other sociodemographic factors (Table 3), individuals with inadequate

health literacy were less likely (p=0.014) to have made changes to their plans, and less likely

to report social distancing as important (p<0.001), but much more likely to feel personally

unprepared for widespread outbreak (p<0.001) compared to those with adequate health

literacy. Individuals with inadequate health literacy were less likely to have increased their

alcohol intake (p=0.013), but not eating unhealthy snacks (p=0.20) compared to those with

adequate health literacy. Of those taking regular prescription medication, individuals with

inadequate health literacy reported it was more difficult to remember and access

medication during lockdown (p=0.013).

Support for misinformation
Across the sample, support for misinformation about COVID-19 was generally more

prominent in younger age groups, males, those with inadequate health literacy, fewer

chronic health conditions, and those who spoke a LOTE at home (Table 2). After controlling

for other sociodemographic factors (Table 3), those with inadequate health literacy were

significantly more likely to agree that the effectiveness of vaccines is made up (p<0.001), the

threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated (p=0.029), the benefits of herd immunity for

COVID-19 are being covered up (p=0.022), and that government restrictions are stronger

than what is needed (p=0.003), compared to individuals with adequate health literacy.

DISCUSSION

Our findings show important disparities in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviours

related to COVID-19 that have the potential to undermine efforts to reduce viral

transmission and may lead to social inequalities in health outcomes in Australia. People with

lower health literacy had poorer understanding of COVID-19 symptoms, were less able to

identify behaviours to prevent infection, and experienced more difficulty finding

information and understanding government messaging about COVID-19. They were less

likely to rate social distancing as important and reported more difficulty remembering and

accessing medication since lockdown. They felt less prepared and more anxious about

COVID-19, reported experiencing greater financial toxicity but also perceived they were less

likely to get sick from COVID-19. Similar patterns were observed among those who primarily

spoke a LOTE at home. Notably, there was markedly higher endorsement of misinformation

beliefs in people with lower health literacy and LOTE background, which is a concern as

these items relate to ongoing efforts to prevent viral transmission and trust in vaccination -

the major hope for mitigating COVID-19 worldwide.

The findings support our earlier concerns about the low level of attention paid to health

literacy in COVID-19 public health messaging (6).

In our preliminary analysis of health

information presented on government websites we found readability scores to be higher

than the level suitable for the average Australian (reading Grade 8), and far higher than the

grade required for low literacy communities (Grade 5) including those with English as a

second language. The findings echo results reported in the US (Chicago) sister survey

conducted in March (7).

Here, even larger social disparities in key knowledge, attitude and

prevention behaviours were reported.

Although Australia is in a much more favourable

position in relation to COVID-19 than the US for many reasons, the need for ongoing

attention to social variation in community uptake of public health messages remains. Until

an effective vaccine is available, our primary defence against the spread of COVID-19 is

behaviour change. Effective behaviour change relies on diverse communities and patient

groups being able to understand, trust and act on evolving health advice.

Our

comprehensive survey of over 4000 Australians suggests there are important knowledge

and attitude gaps which may threaten efforts to reduce viral transmission in Australia.

A systematic review of communication during the H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic in 118 studies

(17) reported a consistent association between social inequalities in communication and

emergency preparedness outcomes. Trust in sources of information, worry and levels of

knowledge about the disease, and routine media exposure as well as information-seeking

behaviours, were related to greater likelihood of adoption of recommended viral infection

prevention behaviours. The review suggests that when inequalities are addressed in

communication the effectiveness of the pandemic response can be increased.

Limitations of study

The recruited sample is large and diverse but is not statistically representative of the

Australian population. The proportion of Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds

was small and we had very few Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants in our

sample (2%), although this similar to the national estimate of 3.5%.

Future surveys need to

target these groups as we were unable to do so with limited time and funds for this project.

Our sample of adults with low health literacy is similar to other studies we have conducted

(~15%)(18).

The single item measure of health literacy used for assessment is simple and

non-stigmatising to administer, however it under-reports problems with health literacy,

identifying only those with very low health literacy levels (19). It was correlated with our

additional related measure of numeracy, ehealth literacy and graphical literacy (all P values

<0.001). Future studies should use more comprehensive literacy measures to understand

the associations with key knowledge, attitude and behaviour outcomes related to COVID-19.

Conclusion

COVID-19 presents a disproportionate burden to people with chronic disease, who are also

more likely to have poorer health literacy and speak a language other than English at home.

Health messages must be tailored to meet the needs of these groups as our study shows

important disparities in understanding, beliefs and behaviours that may put already

vulnerable people at greater risk. Those with the greatest burden of chronic disease are

most disadvantaged, and most likely to experience severe disease and die from COVID-19. It

is imperative that health advice reaches them in a way they understand and can implement.

Addressing the health literacy needs of the community in public health messaging about

COVID-19 must now be a priority in Australia.
