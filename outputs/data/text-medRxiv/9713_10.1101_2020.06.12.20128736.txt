Abstract

21

The urgent need for large-scale diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 has prompted pursuit of

22

sample-collection methods of sufficient sensitivity to replace sampling of the nasopharynx (NP).

23

Among these alternatives is collection of nasal-swab samples, which can be performed by the

24

patient, avoiding the need for healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment.

25

Previous studies have reached opposing conclusions regarding whether nasal sampling is

26

concordant or discordant with NP. To resolve this disagreement, we compared nasal and NP

27

specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort consisting of individuals clinically

28

suspected of COVID-19 and outpatients known to be SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive undergoing

29

follow-up. We investigated three different transport conditions, including traditional viral

30

transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, for each of two different nasal-swab collection protocols

31

on a total of 308 study participants, and compared categorical results and Ct values to those

32

from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was

33

performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100

34

copies viral genomic RNA/mL transport medium). We found high concordance (Cohen’s kappa

35

>0.8) only for patients with viral loads above 1,000 copies/mL. Those with viral loads below

36

1,000 copies/mL, the majority in our cohort, exhibited low concordance (Cohen’s kappa = 0.49);

37

most of these would have been missed by nasal testing alone. Previous reports of high

38

concordance may have resulted from use of assays with higher LoD (≥1,000 copies/mL). These

39

findings counsel caution in use of nasal testing in healthcare settings and contact-tracing efforts,

40

as opposed to screening of asymptomatic, low-prevalence, low-risk populations. Nasal testing is

41

an adjunct, not a replacement, for NP.

Introduction

43

Controlling the COVID-19 pandemic will require a massive expansion of testing for SARS-CoV-

44

2 in several different clinical and epidemiological contexts. Until recently, nasopharyngeal (NP)

45

swabs were the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) preferred

46

specimen type, as these specimens were thought to provide the most robust detection of patient

47

infection. However, there are conflicting reports as to which of several specimen types bear the

48

highest viral load1–3, and ultimately the “preferred-specimen” specification was removed from

49

interim CDC guidance on 29 April 20204. Sensitivity is a complex issue, however, as detection in

50

the upper airways (nasopharynx and oropharynx) is affected by multiple factors including

51

duration of illness prior to testing5 as well as the limit of detection (LoD) of the RT-PCR assay

52

used6.

53

Availability of NP swabs and the resources to establish NP collection sites with specimen

54

collection personnel have remained critical bottlenecks. To resolve these issues, healthcare

55

systems have adopted multiple different strategies, including engaging industrial manufacturers

56

to mass produce novel 3D-printed NP swabs7, as well as evaluating different specimen types

57

and alternative sample-collection strategies8–16. Assessment of nasal swabs is a rapidly growing

58

area of interest, specifically because this specimen type involves a less invasive procedure than

59

NP swabs, as only the anterior-to-mid-turbinate area of the nasal passages is accessed.

60

Accordingly, such samples can be self-collected by patients with a simple set of instructions,

61

alleviating the need for highly trained medical personnel for specimen collection and reducing

62

use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in short supply.

63

Many of the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (FDA EUA) RT-

64

PCR assays have approval for use of nasal swabs as a specimen type, but how well nasal

65

swabs perform compared to NP swabs remains unclear. To date, nasal-swab studies have

66

shown conflicting results, with some researchers reporting similar test performance to NP swabs

67

and others finding decreased sensitivity8,10,12–16. Reconciling these differences is challenging, as

68

these studies employed different sampling materials, collection methods, and RT-PCR assays.

69

To address these conflicting reports, here we describe results of a six-arm, 308-subject study

70

comparing two different healthcare-worker nasal-swab collection procedures and three different

71

transport conditions, including in viral transport media (VTM) and dry transport. We discuss our

72

findings in the context of prior reports (including preprints), to more systematically assess nasal-

73

swab test performance and its potential role(s) in addressing diagnostic and epidemiologic

74

needs in the COVID-19 pandemic.

75

Materials and Methods

76

Trial design. Participants were adults over 18 years of age tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the

77

normal course of clinical care, based either on clinically suspected COVID-19 infection or follow-

78

up after previous SARS-CoV-2-positive RT-PCR testing. Participants were asked to be

79

swabbed twice, first with one of the nasal swabs under study (see below for swab-collection

80

protocols) and then with a standard NP swab. To control for potential variability related to self-

81

swabbing, sample collection was performed by trained nurses or respiratory-therapy staff

("study staff") with training and oversight from the respiratory therapy department at Beth Israel

83

Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) drive-through/walk-up (“drive-through”) COVID-19 testing

84

sites. Individuals with known thrombocytopenia (<50,000 platelets/µl) were excluded from the

85

study to avoid risk of bleeding. This study was reviewed and approved by BIDMC’s institutional

86

review board (IRB protocol no. 2020P000451).

87

Transport conditions and swabs used. Standard nasal swabs were compared under three

88

different specimen-transport conditions: (i) a guanidine thiocyanate (GITC) transport buffer, part

89

of the Abbott multi-Collect Specimen Collection Kit, catalog no. 09K12-004; Abbott Laboratories,

90

Abbott Park, IL), (ii) dry, with no buffer; and (iii) in modified CDC viral transport media (VTM)

91

(Hank's balanced salt solution containing 2% heat inactivated FBS, 100µg/mL gentamicin,

92

0.5µg/mL fungizone, and 10mg/L Phenol red, produced by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical

93

Center [BIDMC] Clinical Microbiology Laboratories17). The nasal swab used was the included

94

Abbot swab for the GITC arm and the Hologic Aptima Multitest Swab otherwise (catalog no.

95

AW-14334-001-003; Hologic Inc. Marlborough, MA). The NP swab used was the Copan BD

96

ESwab collection and transport system swab (catalog no. 220532; Copan Diagnostics Inc.,

97

Murietta, CA).

98

PCR compatibility. Although all swabs are routinely used for PCR testing, as a double-check

99

each swab type was assessed for PCR compatibility by overnight incubation in 3 mL of modified

100

CDC VTM (allowing potential PCR inhibitors time to leech into media), spiking 1.5 mL of media

101

with 200 copies/mL of control SARS-CoV-2 amplicon target (twice the LoD of our system),

102

vortexed, and tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 Assay on an Abbott m2000

103

RealTime System platform18, the assay and platform used for all testing in this report, following

104

the same protocol used for clinical testing (see below). All swabs examined in this study passed

105

this quality-control testing for lack of RT-PCR inhibition based on observation of Ct values within

106

expected quality control limits17.

107

Swab collection protocols (Fig. 1). For Procedure 1, for each naris, the swab tip was inserted

108

into the nostril, the patient was told to press a finger against the exterior of that naris, and the

109

swab was rotated against this external pressure for 10 seconds (Fig. 1a); this procedure was

110

repeated with the same swab on the other naris, and then the swab was placed into the

111

collection tube for transport to the laboratory for testing. For Procedure 2, the swab was inserted

112

into the naris until resistance was felt, and the swab was then rotated for 15 seconds without

113

external pressure (Fig. 1b); this procedure was repeated with the same swab on the other naris,

114

and the swab was then placed into the collection tube for transport15. The NP-swab sample was

115

collected from a single naris by standard technique: insertion to appropriate depth, 10 rotations,

116

removal, and placement into transport-media tube containing VTM4. To maximize collection of

117

material from the nares, in all cases sampling using the nasal swab (both nares) was performed

118

first, before the NP swab.

119

Sample processing and testing. Samples were sent to the BIDMC Clinical Microbiology

120

Laboratories for testing. Dry swabs were eluted in 2mL of Abbott mWash1 (100mM Tris with

121

guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) and detergent). Swabs transported in GITC buffer were

122

supplemented with 1mL of Abbott mWash1 solution to achieve minimum volume requirements

123

for testing. Tests were performed with 1.5mL of sample media using the Abbott RealTime

124

SARS-CoV-2 assay for EUA for use with nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs18. This dual-target

125

assay detects both the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and N

126

(nucleocapsid) genes with an in-lab verified LoD of 100 copies/mL6,17.

127

Statistical analyses. RT-PCR results reported categorically as either positive or negative, and

128

these were used for concordance testing by Cohen's kappa19.

129

For analyses based on cycle-threshold (Ct) values, for discordant samples (positive nasal-

130

swab/negative NP-swab result or vice versa), the negative result was assigned a Ct value of 37,

131

the total number of cycles run. Conversion to viral load was performed as described previously6.

132

We tested whether Ct values for a given set of nasal swabs differed from the Ct values for the

133

paired NP swabs (the controls) using Wilcoxon’s paired t-test. This tested the null hypothesis

134

that values for controls and prototypes are drawn from the same underlying distribution; p>0.05

135

was interpreted as no difference. We used bootstrapping to test whether the n results for a

136

given arm exhibited appreciable differences from others, specifically by testing whether a given

137

arm differed from random samples from (i) results pooled across the three arms that used the

138

same nasal-swab sampling procedure or (ii) all results. For each bootstrap test, we sampled n

139

data points at random from the larger pool to create a synthetic dataset, calculating Cohen’s

140

kappa on this synthetic dataset, and repeating this process for 100,000 synthetic datasets to

141

create a distribution (histogram) of kappa values; this distribution constitutes a null model of the

142

kappa one would expect to observe by chance in a sample of n results, given the data in the

143

larger pool. Using this distribution, we then calculated the probability of observing a kappa at

144

least as high as the kappa actually observed for the n results from a given arm, to test for

145

consistency with expectation; inconsistency (p<0.05 or p>0.95) would reject the null hypothesis

146

that the study arm and the larger pool are statistically indistinguishable (as measured by kappa).

147

For completeness, we performed the same bootstrap analysis to compare Procedure 1 results

148

to all results and to compare Procedure 2 results to all results.

149

We used Python (v3.6-3.8) and its NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and ct2vl libraries for the

150

above analyses and related visualizations.

151

Literature review. We searched Pubmed and the preprint servers bioRxiv and medRxiv

152

through June 1, 2020 for all literature on nasal-swab sampling for SARS-CoV-2 and extracted

153

sample sizes, collection methods, RT-PCR assay information, and 2x2 contingency table data

154

comparing nasal swabs to NP swabs wherever available.

155

Results

156

Table 1 shows the numbers of patients tested in each of the six arms of our nasal- vs. NP-swab

157

study. Visual inspection of plots of the Ct values of the nasal swab vs. NP-swab controls

158

suggested worse performance for nasal swabs across all six arms, with no obvious differences

159

between the two swab procedures or among the dry-swab, VTM, or GITC collection methods

160

(Fig. 2). Statistical testing confirmed that results for each arm were indistinguishable from the

161

overall results, supporting the functional equivalence of all swab/transport-condition

162

combinations (Table 2). For concordant positives, comparison of Ct values between nasal and

163

NP swabs showed higher Cts for nasal swabs than for NP swabs, suggesting slightly but

164

consistently lower yield from the nasal swabs (Wilcoxon p=9×10-11). Consistent with this

165

conclusion, there was a marked increase in false negatives for NP-swabs with higher Ct values

166

(lower viral loads), resulting in low concordance overall (Cohen’s kappa=0.49) (Fig. 2).

167

Our overall finding of low concordance was in contrast to some previous reports, which have

168

found nasal-swab collection to exhibit excellent sensitivity as well as Ct-value concordance13,15 ,

169

but was consistent with others10,14, including, for example, one recent study at a New York,

170

USA, hospital that also noted lower nasal-swab concordance for higher Ct values16. Close

171

review of these previous reports revealed that they differed in the type of specimen and/or result

172

they used as a reference (e.g. any test-sample positive versus using NP swabs as the gold

173

standard) and in the parameters they used in order to describe test performance (e.g. positive

174

percent agreement versus sensitivity). To control for at least the latter, we extracted 2x2

175

contingency-table data from these reports to facilitate comparison to each other and to our own

176

results (Table 3). Notably, many of these studies used a modified version of the CDC assay that

177

did not report a LoD. Furthermore, of the studies that report the Ct values of their results, no

178

viral-load conversion was provided, which is important since different RT-PCR assays and

179

platforms have unique conversions between Ct value and viral load. Therefore, we were unable

180

to systematically compare nasal-swab performance at low viral loads in these reports. These

181

differences left open the possibility that inconsistent comparative performance of nasal-swab

182

sampling might be explained largely by differences assay LoD, and possibly also by patient viral

183

load. (We note that while the nasal-swab sampling protocols and transport media conditions

184

varied between studies, our results suggest these differences are unlikely to affect detection).

185

We therefore revisited the trend we observed of a rise in nasal-swab-negative discordant results

186

(false negatives) with higher Ct value. Recently we demonstrated that Ct values for the SARS-

187

CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and platform used in the present study are reliable quantitative measures

188

of viral load, and introduced a conversion from Ct value to viral load6. Building on those findings,

189

here we asked what the concordance would have been, for our nasal-vs.-NP data, had the LoD

190

of our assay been higher than its actual 100 copies/mL. Specifically, we re-calculated kappa for

191

different LoD cutoffs, and found that kappa rose steeply from ~0.5 (low concordance) to 0.8-0.9

192

(excellent concordance) as the LoD cutoff was increased from 100 copies/mL through 1,000

193

copies/mL and beyond (Fig. 3). This finding strongly supports the view that nasal swabs miss

194

many if not most patients with low viral load (below ~1,000 copies/mL), but is reliable for

195

patients with medium or high viral loads, potentially resolving disagreements among previous

196

reports.

197

Discussion

198

It is widely acknowledged that resolving the damage that the COVID-19 pandemic has wrought

199

to health, the economy, and society will require distributing and scaling up testing to

200

unprecedented levels. For this reason, there is great and widespread interest in developing

201

alternatives to NP-swab sampling for COVID-19 diagnosis. Governments and medical

202

institutions alike have expressed interest in adopting nasal swabs as an alternative, as the self-

203

administration of these swabs would allow vastly increased testing capacity, save PPE, and

204

ease the burden on healthcare workers. Independently, the ability to transport swabs to testing

205

locations without need of transport media such as VTM would further streamline testing

206

processes. Reflecting this interest in nasal swabs, the US CDC has removed the “preference”

207

specification for NP swabs from their interim guidance and note that nasal swabs are an

208

acceptable alternative specimen as of 29 April 20204. However, confidence in population-scale

209

testing strategies based on nasal swabs is complicated by conflicting reports as to how well they

210

perform relative NP swabs, the antecedent gold standard, as we have described.

211

Our results strongly suggest that concordance between nasal and NP swabs depends on the

212

LoD of the PCR assay used to measure positivity, with high concordance for medium-to-high

213

viral loads and low concordance for low viral loads, which may lie below the LoDs of various

214

assays currently in widespread use (Fig. 3)6. We find that nasal swab samples reliably detect

215

patients with viral loads ≥1,000 copies/mL but miss many patients who have lower viral loads,

216

the majority in our study6. A complete biological explanation will require further study; however,

217

one possibility is that in cases of high viral load, replicating virus may be more likely to spread to

218

respiratory epithelium bordering and/or in the deeper portions of the anterior nares, where it can

219

be recovered by nasal swab.

220

our findings may reconcile disagreements in prior reports, which have compared nasal swab

221

performance only as a function of Ct values which are not comparable from study to study, not

222

viral load, as we have done here,. We hypothesize that the outpatient/urgent care testing sites

223

in these studies may have selected for patients early in the course of disease, when viral load is

224

high13,15. For example, one study13 that showed high concordance used an assay with a

225

negative Ct cutoff of 40, and only a handful of patient samples had Ct values above 35.

226

Although again the viral loads were not reported, the discrepancy between cutoff and Ct values

227

suggested preferential sampling of patients with only high viral loads. (Note that a Ct value of 35

228

can correspond to different viral loads in different assays and the LoD of this assay was 4,167

229

copies/mL, over 40 times the cutoff in the assay we used.) Notably, the patient population in the

230

present study consisted of both first-time and individuals with repeat testing for test of cure.

231

Many of the latter have been observed to exhibit low-level viral load for multiple weeks in the

232

absence of severe symptoms and enrichment of these patients may impact the overall

233

performance of NP and nasal swabs in individual studies. In other studies, such differences may

234

be more or less obscured depending on the limit of detection of the assay in use which may

235

straddle the 1,000 copies/mL threshold we found for nasal swabs to consistently detect

236

infection.

237

Interestingly, we found no difference among transport media conditions and between sampling

238

protocols, suggesting that lower sensitivity of nasal swab sampling is an overall limitation of the

239

anatomical location of nasal swabs and that the protocols and media conditions we tested are

240

interchangeable. Thus, for patients above a critical threshold of 1,000 copies/mL (Fig. 2), nasal

241

swabs collected in VTM, GITC transport medium, and as dry swabs are all likely to perform

242

equally well in the population, providing multiple potential options for specimen acquisition.

243

Our results suggest several settings in which nasal swabs may and may not best be used. Peak

244

infectiousness is likely to occur near or shortly before symptom onset20,21 and nasopharyngeal

245

viral load is often undetectable a week after symptom onset2. Lower-sensitivity testing would

246

therefore likely miss patients with early developing presymptomatic infections and patients

247

presenting multiple days after symptom onset. Notably, for those presenting later to care, a

248

false-negative diagnosis could bear significant clinical implications in not only erroneously

249

reassuring the patient and clinical team, but also excluding them from potentially useful and

250

rationed therapies such as remdesivir22 or others. Importantly, based on viral load distribution in

251

first-time tested individuals at our institution, ~20% of newly presenting SARS-CoV-2 positive

252

individuals would be missed if sampled solely using nasal swabs6, highlighting the potential

253

magnitude of this problem.

254

Nevertheless, nasal swabs provide considerable advantage in terms of ease of collection and

255

potential self-collection. Based on our results, they would serve best in high-test-volume, point

256

prevalence screens in healthy populations, for example, in businesses and universities, where

257

identification of highly infectious individuals will be a prelude to targeted testing with the most

258

sensitive techniques possible to quell outbreaks and forestall local spread. Conversely, nasal

259

swabs should not be used for screening symptomatic and especially hospitalized patients,

260

where the more sensitive and resource intensive nasopharyngeal sampling would be justified,

261

and help direct care and most appropriate use of infection control resources. In summary, whilst

262

nasal swabs are a welcome addition to the armamentarium of tools needed to combat COVID-

263

19, we should be well aware of possible limitations in diagnostic sensitivity and use this

264

resource judiciously.

Nasal swabs were inserted as far as comfortably possible and
at least 2–3 cm inside one nostril, rotating the swab 5 times
and leaving in place for 5–10 seconds.
Supervised self-collected nasal swab used a CLASSIQSwab™
that the patient was instructed to insert into one nostril to
the depth of 3-4cm and rotate for 5-10 seconds before
storing the swab in RNA storage media (DNA/RNA Sheld,
Zymo Research Corp)
Nasal swabs collected with a foam swab (Puritan 25-1506
1PF100) via inserting in the vertical position into one nasal
passage until gentle resistance and leaving the swab in place
for 10-15 seconds and rotating. Swabs were stored in viral
transport media.
Mid-turbinate swabs collected with a nylon flocked swab
(MDL NasoSwab A362CS02) via inserting in the horizontal
position into the nasal passage until gentle resistance is met,
leaving the swab in for 10-15 seconds and rotating
Dry nasal samples were obtained with swabs supplied with
the Abbott assay (Puritan Medical Products 25-1506 IPF100).
Nasal samples were obtained from both nares.

1. Insert the swab horizontally into the first nostril until you meet resistance.
The entire length of the bulb should be completely inside the nose. This
might make the participant feel like sneezing; reposition if necessary.

En#re bulb is inside nose—DO BOTH NOSTRILS!!!

5. Remove swab from nose, place swab into the appropriate tube, and seal the
tube tightly.

4. Twirl the swab around for a full 15 seconds in the second nostril.

3. Remove the swab from the first nostril and then insert the same swab
horizontally into the second nostril, again until you meet resistance. Again,
the entire length of the bulb should be completely inside the nose.

2. Twirl the swab around for a full 15 seconds in the first nostril.

Please watch 3:55-4:05 of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jTvoVk1B4E

NASAL SWABBING INSTRUCTIONS

1. As reasonably needed, tilt the patient's head back to improve access to the
anterior nares. For each naris (nostril), perform following.
2. Insert the swab tip into the nostril and press against the inner wall of the naris.
3. Press against the exterior naris, so that you may feel the pressure applied by
the swab against your finger.
4. Rotate the swab for 10 seconds, against the pressure of your finger (clockwise,
counterclockwise, or both).
5. Remove swab from first naris and repeat on the opposite naris.
6. After thoroughly swabbing each nares, place swab into the appropriate tube.
With your finger, gently
press the side of the nose
against the swab, as you
rotate the swab with the
other hand

Concordance (measured by Cohen’s kappa) plotted against assay LoD. With LoD of 100

308

copies/mL (yellow arrowhead) the Abbott assay detects false negatives in nasal-swab samples,

309

resulting in low concordance (0.49; yellow dotted line). An assay with LoD of 1,000 copies/mL

310

(blue arrowhead) would have missed these false negatives, which would have yielded a high

311

observed concordance (0.82; blue dotted line).
