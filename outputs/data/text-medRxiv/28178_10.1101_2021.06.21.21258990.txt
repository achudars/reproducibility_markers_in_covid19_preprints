Abstract
Importance: While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against disease, breakthrough infections may
occur in the context of rising variants of concern.
Objective: We paired random and passive surveillance nucleic acid testing with analysis of viral whole
genomic sequences to detect and describe breakthrough infections, focusing in a university community.
Design: Anterior nasal swabs were collected from individuals for a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)
for detection of SARS-CoV-2. A subset of NAAT positive samples was sequenced to determine variants
associated with infections. Included in the testing and sequencing protocol were individuals that were fully
vaccinated.
Setting: This study was performed as part of a surveillance program for SARS-CoV-2 on a university
campus with 49,700 students and employees.
Participants: Surveillance testing was random and included approximately 10% of the population each
week. Additionally, individuals self-identified with COVID-19 related symptoms or those that had close
contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were also tested.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus which causes COVID-19.
Some infections are asymptomatic or cause mild symptoms, while other individuals are severely disabled
or die from their disease. COVID-19 has caused 582,769 deaths in the United States to date. With the
development and rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, the positivity rate across the nation has started to
decrease. Reinfections are reported from 2-12%2,3. A vaccine breakthrough infection is defined as the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen collected from a person ≥14 days after
they have completed all recommended doses of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized
COVID-19 vaccine (CDC), and reports of reinfections are accumulating4. Currently, in the United States,
one is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after a two-dose vaccine (e.g., mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-

BioNTech or Moderna) or two weeks after a one-dose vaccine (e.g., adenoviral vectored vaccine from
Johnson & Johnson Janssen). At the time of this publication, variants of concern are on the rise. The most
prevalent variant of concern within this population included here is B.1.1.7, followed distantly by P.1 and
B.1.429. Understanding these breakthrough infections are important as it can help guide public health
officials, pharmaceutical industries, and medical providers to determine the next steps in development of
booster vaccines, efficacy of our vaccines against reinfection and find out if the current vaccines are limiting
infections if exposed to variants.

Methods
This is a retrospective analysis of results that were obtained from students and employees in a university
setting. Data were obtained in deidentified format from the electronic health record system from One-toOne Health. Approval from the One-to-One Health review board was obtained. The Institutional Review
Board from the Purdue University Human Research Protection Program determined that viral genome
sequencing of deidentified remnant RNA samples included in this study is not research involving human
subjects (IRB-2021-438). Individuals were tested either through a random surveillance program or because
of COVID-19-like symptoms or exposure. Due to the testing protocol at the time of this publication,
individuals that were fully vaccinated were still included in surveillance testing. Anterior nasal swabs were
collected in PrimeStore MTM (Longhorn Vaccines and Diagnostics) and submitted to the Animal Disease
Diagnostic Lab at Purdue University for a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (TaqPath COVID-19 Test
Kit, ThermoFisher Scientific). Viral whole genome sequencing was performed on at least 15% (34% on
average) of positive samples per week in the Carpi Lab using MinION Mk1B or GridION Mk1 Nanopore
devices (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT, UK). High-accuracy basecalling was performed using
Guppy v4.2.4 and consensus genome sequences were generated following the ARTIC bioinformatics
pipeline v.1.1.3. Lineages were assigned using Pangolin v.2.4.2, according to the system described in
Rambaut et al 20205. Samples that were sequenced were randomly selected based on Ct values (Cts ≤30
could be included). Additionally, samples were specifically selected for sequencing, including S drop out
samples (no spike gene detected but other two targets were positive), samples from those with history of
travel (both within and outside the US), and samples from fully vaccinated individuals and from those with
reinfections. This report reviews data from 14 individuals that were fully vaccinated.

Results
The data from our cohort demonstrated that from February 10, 2021 to May 10, 2021, we performed 2,551
nucleic acid amplification tests from samples from fully vaccinated individuals, and of these, 14 represent
breakthrough infections (0.55%, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.92). In comparison, we tested 65,877 samples from
unvaccinated/partially vaccinated individuals during the same time period, of which 1,482 were positive by
NAAT (2.25%, 95% CI: 2.14 to 2.37). Of the breakthrough infections, six of these individuals received the
Pfizer vaccine, five received the Moderna vaccine, and three received the J&J vaccine. Some of these
individuals carried high viral loads, based on Ct values (Table 1). Many of these breakthroughs were
associated with variants of concern (VOCs - B.1.1.7 and P.1) according to the CDC classification (Table 1).
Asymptomatic infections composed 9/14 (64%) of the cases, and the majority of cases were detected in
females (10/14, 71%).
Contact tracing reports for these 14 individuals were reviewed to assess if their identified close contacts
tested positive afterward. One of 13 cases (one report was unavailable for review) had a close contact test
positive. This one positive was caused by a B.1.1.7 VOC.

Discussion
B.1.1.7 has been shown in multiple studies to have minimal impact on neutralization by post-vaccination
sera6. It is probable that the breakthroughs with this particular variant are more likely a result of increased
circulation of this variant during this time point. This variant composed approximately 31% of the total
positive samples during the period of this particular breakthrough, with at least 12 other variants composing
the other 69% in this population. P.1 contains the E484K mutation, which mediates escape from vaccineinduced humoral immunity7. Notable mutations in the breakthrough infection associated with the B.1.617.2
lineage includes L452R and P681R in the spike protein. P681R mutation is found in the furin cleavage site,
which mediate increased rate of membrane fusion, internalization, leading to higher viral loads and
increased transmissibility8. Interestingly, B.1.2 has markedly declined within this population, so detection of
this lineage in association with one vaccine breakthrough case was an interesting finding, however no
notable mutations except for the linked D614G and P314L were detected in this B.1.2 viral genome.
These data demonstrate that each of the vaccines have associated breakthrough infections, and with these
small numbers we cannot report that one is more or less effective in our population. Of note, the J&J vaccine
during this period was temporarily removed from the market due to investigation. Females have composed
approximately 63% of reported breakthrough cases9. Females are overrepresented in this group as well.
While approximately 45% of vaccine breakthroughs have been reported from those aged 60 and above,
these data show that these infections also occur in college-aged individuals. Given that the majority of these
breakthroughs were detected through surveillance from asymptomatic individuals on a university campus,
it is likely that this age group and asymptomatic infections are underrepresented with regard to reported
vaccine breakthrough cases. However, the data reviewed in this report suggests that these breakthrough
infections may not have much clinical significance because only 1 in contact case was identified. However,
it is important to note that once identified as positive for SARS-CoV-2, these individuals were placed in
isolation so further spread would be minimized or prevented.

Conclusion
These results provide genomic evidence of breakthrough infections and suggest that fully vaccinated
individuals, including those with asymptomatic infections, are less likely to serve as a source of infection for
others; however, this finding requires further investigations. Notably, the percentage of positives in this
group was significantly lower than in the unvaccinated/partially vaccinated cohort. Fewer detected
breakthrough infections in the full-vaccinated group reinforces the need to get vaccinated in order to
decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observations provide support for the need of sustained
efforts to diagnose asymptomatic infections and characterization of variants.
