ABSTRACT

31

Determinants of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the development of

32

well-standardized, reproducible antibody assays to be utilized in concert with clinical trials to

33

establish correlates of risk and protection. This need has led to the appearance of a variety of

34

neutralization assays used by different laboratories and companies. Using plasma samples

35

from COVID-19 convalescent individuals with mild-to-moderate disease from a localized

36

outbreak in a single region of the western US, we compared three platforms for SARS-CoV-2

37

neutralization: assay with live SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus assay utilizing lentiviral (LV) and

38

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) packaging, and a surrogate ELISA test. Vero, Vero E6,

39

HEK293T cells expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and TZM-bl

40

cells expressing hACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) were evaluated.

41

Live-virus and LV-pseudovirus assay with HEK293T cells showed similar geometric mean

42

titers (GMTs) ranging 141–178, but VSV-pseudovirus assay yielded significantly higher GMT

43

(310 95%CI 211-454; p < 0.001). Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) titers from live-virus

44

and all pseudovirus assay readouts were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.81–0.89). ND50

45

titers positively correlated with plasma concentration of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike and

receptor binding domain (RBD) (r = 0.63–0.89), but moderately correlated with nucleoprotein

47

IgG (r = 0.46–0.73). There was a moderate positive correlation between age and spike

48

(Spearman’s rho=0.37, p=0.02), RBD (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein IgG (rho=0.45,

49

p=0.003). ND80 showed stronger correlation with age than ND50 (ND80 rho=0.51 (p=0.001),

50

ND50 rho=0.28 (p=0.075)). Our data demonstrate high concordance between cell-based

51

assays with live and pseudotyped virions.

INTRODUCTION (5500 words)

54

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory

55

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused more than 63 million confirmed infections

56

and over 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of November 30th, 2020

57

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). Тo minimize virus transmission and reduce

58

mortality, regulations enforcing mask use and limiting close contact were implemented in many

59

countries. An initial success of these orders with an observable reduction in cases led to

60

relaxed social distancing orders and lockdowns. This in turn has been followed by a new surge

61

of infections, with case rates and mortality exceeding the initial outbreaks. It is clear that the

62

reopening of society and return to a pre-pandemic lifestyle will be possible only after safe and

63

efficacious vaccines and therapies are developed and implemented.

64

The efficacy of most licensed vaccines correlates with pathogen-neutralizing antibodies elicited

65

by vaccination (1). Humans can mount neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses against SARS-

66

CoV-2 during natural infection (2–5). Epidemiologic data suggest that reinfection rates seem

67

low, albeit increasing numbers of sporadic reinfections are being reported (6, 7). A crucial

68

unknown at this time is what immune responses are associated with protective immunity.

69

Recent studies suggest passive infusion of monoclonal antibodies can alter COVID-19 disease

70

progression. Infusion of convalescent sera is more controversial regarding its efficacy. In order

71

to determine what constitutes protective immunity in human populations, well-standardized,

72

reproducible antibody assays are required to establish correlates of risk and protection. The

73

current study evaluates several assays that are under validation for use to determine

74

correlates of protection in vaccine studies evaluating immune responses in persons with

75

symptomatic COVID-19. These assays include a live-virus neutralization assay, which is

76

notable because work with live SARS-CoV-2 requires Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment;

77

something not readily available at many institutions and not easily amenable to high-

78

throughput experiments.

79

To avoid these barriers and improve assay feasibility, a variety of live-virus neutralization

80

assays use recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) containing GFP or luciferase reporter

81

genes at the ORF7 locus of the viral genome (8, 9). These recombinant viruses replicate

82

similarly to SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in vitro and successfully infect primary airway

83

epithelial cell cultures. A fluorescence-based rSARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay yielded

84

comparable results to plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) in nAb detection from

85

convalescent patient plasma (8). With a shorter turnaround time (24-48 hours for reporter virus

86

vs. 3 days for PRNT), rSARS-CoV-2 provides a useful high-throughput platform to study nAb

87

responses, but still requires a BSL-3 laboratory for assay set up and readout.

88

Reporter assays using pseudotyped viruses, which are restricted to a single round of

89

intracellular replication, allow experiments to be carried out in BSL-2 environments.

90

Pseudotyped viral particles can be created with two packaging platforms: lentiviral/retroviral

91

and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (10–13). Both packaging systems have been used for

92

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus reporter neutralization assays and have been tested on multiple cell

93

types expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

94

(14–16). Human lung carcinoma Calu-3 cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, and

95

green monkey kidney epithelial Vero cells were the most susceptible for VSV-pseudovirus

96

entry (17). Both Calu-3 and Caco-2, but not Vero, cells express endogenous transmembrane

97

serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry; however,

98

there were no significant differences in VSV-pseudovirus entry between the three cell types

99

(17). Vero E6 cells have the highest level of ACE2 expression and both Vero and Vero E6 cells

100

exogenously expressing TMPRSS2 were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (17–19).

101

HEK 293T cells transfected to express human ACE2 were also developed and tested in

102

pseudovirus neutralization assays (20).

103

Binding antibody (bAb) assays are an alternative to cell-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization

104

assays (15, 21, 22). Major advantages of bAb assays include their cost, speed and safety. The

105

receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is the major target for

106

nAbs (23–25), and bAb assays are therefore based on the detection of antibodies that

107

compete with ACE2 for RBD binding. As opposed to measuring actual virus neutralization,

108

surrogate bAb assays report percent binding inhibition between RBD and ACE2, which is then

109

interpreted as percent neutralization. Competitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (15) and

110

ELISA (21, 22) have both been developed for this purpose. While they provide inexpensive

111

and rapid detection of RBD-targeting nAbs, bAb assays cannot measure neutralization via

112

non-RBD spike protein epitopes or concerted action of antibodies targeting different epitopes.

113

In the current study, we used plasma samples from convalescent individuals with mild-to-

114

moderate COVID-19 disease to compare three different SARS-CoV-2 neutralization platforms:

115

1) a live recombinant SARS-CoV-2 assay, 2) pseudovirus-based assays, and 3) a surrogate,

116

ELISA-based test. In addition, two different pseudovirus packaging systems and three different

117

cell lines were characterized. We also examined the correlation between neutralization and the

118

concentration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-, spike- and RBD-specific IgG.

METHODS

121

Study Population & Specimen Collection. Residents of Blaine County, Idaho ≥18 years of

122

age volunteered for study participation by completing a secure online intake form. Study

123

volunteers were selected for participation using a two-phased approach. In the first phase,

124

study volunteers were randomly selected for participation after stratification by ZIP code, and

125

within ZIP code, age, gender and race/ethnicity. In the second phase, all volunteers who were

126

Blaine County first responders and their families were selected for participation. Selected

127

volunteers were invited for study participation in May 2020 and sent an electronic consent

128

statement. Following enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire in REDCap, a secure

129

software tool, to collect demographic information and symptom histories since January 15,

130

2020. Appointments for sample collection were scheduled upon survey completion. Blood was

131

collected into 10 mL vials containing acid citrate dextrose and shipped overnight to the Fred

132

Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1200´g for

133

15 mins and aliquoted into cryovials. One aliquot was submitted for Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG

134

assay (Abbott). Others were heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 ºC, frozen at -80 ºC and

135

distributed to testing laboratories. Study participants were informed of the qualitative results of

136

the Abbott IgG Serology assay via email within one week since obtaining test results. This

137

study was approved by the Fred Hutch Institutional Review Board and all study materials were

138

provided in both English and Spanish.

139

Protein antigens. A recombinant form of a synthetic construct (SARS_CoV_2_ectoCSPP

140

(26); GenBank: QJE37812.1) of the spike (S) glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1

141

was produced in human HEK293 cells (FreeStyle™ 293-F Cells, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA)

142

using a lentivirus expression system (27) and purified by nickel affinity and size-exclusion

143

chromatography. Purity and solution monodispersivity were confirmed by comparative

144

reduced/non-reduced PAGE, analytical size-exclusion chromatography, and static/dynamic

145

light scattering on Uncle (Unchained Labs, Pleasanton, CA) and showed uniform trimerization.

146

The recombinant protein was modified by replacing the native leader sequence with a murine

147

Igk leader, removing the polybasic S1/S2 cleavage site (RRAR to A), stabilized with a pair of

148

proline mutations (2P), and incorporating a thrombin cleavage site, a T4 foldon trimerization

149

domain, a hexa-histidine purification tag, and a C-terminal Avi-Tag (28). After purification, the

150

protein was sterile filtered and aliquoted in DPBS, no calcium, no magnesium (ThermoFisher).

151

An analogous RBD-only version of this construct, swapping a TEV protease (29) site for the

152

Thrombin site, was also produced following identical protocols. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2

153

spike glycoprotein was produced as described elsewhere (23). Both spike protein preparations

154

were tested in binding assay and no difference in recognition by serum and plasma samples

155

from different convalescent subjects was found. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was purchased

156

from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and tetanus toxoid from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland).

VSV-pseudovirus. The codon-optimized sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

158

(YP_009724390.1) with a truncation of the 19 C-terminal amino acids (D19) was cloned into a

159

pcDNA3.1(+) vector (ThermoFisher) under control of the human CMV promoter to generate

160

pcDNA3.1(+)-SARS-CoV-2-D19. The C-terminal truncation leads to a deletion of the ER-

161

retention signal, localizing the spike protein to the cell surface, which enhances pseudovirus

162

packaging (30). VSV(G*ΔG-luciferase) system was purchased from Kerafast (13, 31). Twenty-

163

four hours prior infection with VSV(G*ΔG-luciferase), 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA-

164

WuhanCoV-S-D19. Next day, supernatant was harvest, centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000xg,

165

aliquoted and stored at -80 ºC. TCID50 was measured by infecting Vero cells (catalog number

166

CCL-81; ATCC) with serial 2-fold dilutions of the prepared pseudovirus.

167

LV-pseudovirus. An expression plasmid encoding codon-optimized full-length spike of the

168

Wuhan-1 strain (VRC7480), was provided by Drs. Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett at

169

the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health (USA). The D614G mutation was

170

introduced into VRC7480 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Site-

171

Directed Mutagenesis Kit from (catalog number 210518; Agilent Technologies). The mutation

172

was confirmed by full-length spike gene sequencing. Pseudovirions were produced in HEK

173

293T/17 cells (catalog number CRL-11268; ATCC) by transfection using Fugene 6 (catalog

174

number E2692; Promega). Pseudovirions for 293T/ACE2 infection were produced by co-

175

transfection with a lentiviral backbone (pCMV-ΔR8.2) and firefly luciferase reporter gene

176

(pHR'-CMV-Luc) (32). Pseudovirions for TZM-bl/ACE2/TMPRSS2 infection were produced by

177

co-transfection with the Env-deficient lentiviral backbone pSG3ΔEnv (kindly provided by Drs

178

Beatrice Hahn and Feng Gao). Culture supernatants from transfections were clarified of cells

179

by low-speed centrifugation and filtration (0.45 µm filter) and stored in 1 ml aliquots at -80oC.

Detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a commercial serologic assay.

181

Plasma samples were tested at the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-

182

certified University of Washington Virology lab using the Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay

183

(Abbott) under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization. The assay

184

is a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay that measures IgG antibodies to the SARS-

185

CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Qualitative results and index values reported by the instrument

186

were used in analyses. Recommended index value cutoff of 1.40 was used for determining

187

positivity (33).

188

Luminex SARS-CoV-2 IgG binding antibody assay. Protein antigens were coupled to the

189

Bio-Plex Pro Magnetic COOH beads in a ratio of 10 μg of antigen per 2.5 x 106 beads in a two-

190

step carbodiimide reaction. First, beads were washed and resuspended in Activation Buffer

191

(100 mM MES, pH 6) and then incubated with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS, catalog

192

number 24520; ThermoFisher) and 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethlyaminopropyl]carbodiimide-HCl (EDC,

193

catalog number 77149; ThermoFisher) also dissolved in Activation Buffer for 20 minutes on an

194

end-over-end rotational mixer at room temperature protected from light. Activated beads were

195

washed three times in Activation buffer. For coupling, antigen was mixed with activated beads

196

and reaction was carried out for 2 h on a rotational mixer at room temperature protected from

197

light. Conjugated beads were washed three times with Wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20,

198

1% BSA, 0.1% NaN3) and finally resuspended in Wash buffer at 107 beads/ml. Beads were

199

stored at 4 ºC for no longer than 30 days.

200

Antigen-specific IgG was measured using two replicate dilutions. Beads were blocked with

201

phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Gibco) containing 5% Blotto (Bio-Rad) and 0.05% Tween-20

202

(Sigma) and incubated for 1 hour with serially diluted plasma samples. Next, beads were

203

washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS and incubated with anti-human IgG Fc-PE

204

(catalog number 2048-09; Sothern Biotech). After incubation with secondary antibody, beads

205

were washed and resuspended in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 and binding data

206

were collected on Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad). Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)

207

was measured for a minimum of 50 beads per region. Background was established by

208

measuring the MFI of beads conjugated to antigens but incubated in Assay buffer. Background

209

MFI values were subtracted from all readings. We also trialed unconjugated beads and beads

210

conjugated to a decoy antigen with the same plasma samples used in testing and did not

211

detect non-specific binding above the assay background described above. Pooled sera from

212

normal human donors collected in 2015 – 2016 was included as the negative control for

213

SARS-CoV-2 antigens. For the positive control we used convalescent plasma from a subject

214

with PCR-confirmed severe COVID-19.

215

An IgG standard curve run in duplicate was used to estimate IgG concentration. Anti-human

216

IgG Fab-specific (Southern Biotech) was conjugated to the same bead regions used to

217

conjugate to antigen proteins. IgG-coupled beads were blocked, washed and incubated with

218

serially diluted human standard IgG (catalog number I4506; Sigma) for 1 h. Standard beads

219

were washed and incubated with anti-human IgG Fc-PE and MFI was measured as described

220

above. MFI readings and associated IgG concentrations were fitted to a four-parameter logistic

221

curve (4PL) using the R packages nCal and drc. A standard curve for each experiment was

222

used to obtain the effective concentrations of IgG in serum using the MFI measured with

223

antigen-coated beads. Since serum samples were also run as a dilution series we used the

224

median of the estimated concentrations from the dilutions that yielded MFIs between 100 and

226

concentration of the minimum (maximum) MFI.

227

Live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Assay was carried out in BSL-3 suite. Vero E6 cells

228

were seeded at 2x104 cells/well in a 96-well plate 24 h before the assay. Seventy five pfu of

229

the recombinant SARS-CoV-2-nanoLuc virus (rSARS-CoV-2-nLuc) (9) were mixed with Ab at

230

1:1 ratio and incubated at 37ºC for 1h. A 8-points, 3-fold dilution curve was generated for each

231

sample with starting concentration at 1:50. Virus and Ab mix was added to each well and

232

incubated at 37ºC + 5% CO2 for 48h. Luciferase activities were measured by Nano-Glo

233

Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following manufacturer protocol using SpectraMax M3

234

luminometer (Molecular Devices). Percent neutralization was calculated by the following

235

equation: [1-(RLU with sample/ RLU with mock treatment)] x 100%.

236

VSV pseudovirus neutralization assay. Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81™) were seeded at

237

2x104 cells/well in a black-walled 96-well plates 24 hours before the assay. A 7-point, 3-fold

238

dilution curve was generated with starting sample dilution at 1:20 in a separate round-bottom

239

96-well plate. 3.8x102 TCID50 of rVSV(G*ΔG-luciferase) pseudovirus with SARS-CoV-2-D19

240

spike protein (PsVSV-Luc-D19) was mixed with the plasma dilutions. Plasma-virus mixture

241

was incubated at 37 ºC in 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. After incubation, plasma-virus mixture was

242

transferred onto the Vero cells. Cells were then incubated at 37 ºC, 5% CO2 for 18-20 hours.

243

Luciferase activity was measured by Bio-Glo Luciferase Assay System (catalog number

244

G7940; Promega) following manufacturer protocol using 2030 VICTOR X3 multilabel reader

278

SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT). Assay was performed according

279

to manufacturer (GenScript) protocol and recommendations as follows. Capture plate was

280

incubated with plasma samples diluted 1:10, washed and probed with secondary antibody.

281

Assay was developed via TMB (ThermoFisher) and OD at 450 nm was measured using

282

SpectraMax M2 reader (Molecular Devices). Positive and negative controls were provided in

283

the kit. Binding inhibition was determined via the following formula: Inhibition = (1 – (OD of

284

sample / OD of Negative control)) × 100%. Percent binding inhibition was interpreted as a

285

percent neutralization. In order to determine ND50, plasma samples were serially diluted

286

starting from 1:10 and assay was performed as described above.

([RLUsample – bkgd] / [RLUVO – bkgd]). The neutralization vs. dilution curve was then fit with a

293

4PL model that was used to estimate the dilution at which there would be 50% or 80%

294

neutralization. For samples with all dilutions having <50% neutralization the result was right

295

censored at the highest concentration. Patient demographic information (sex and age) was

296

extracted from a RedCap survey database. Abbott assay results (including index value) were

297

extracted from the laboratory information system (Sunquest Laboratory).

298

Correlations were estimated between pairs of neutralization or binding antibody readouts using

299

Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r); measures in units of neutralization and IgG concentration

300

were logged prior to estimating correlation. Log-transformed ND50 values and IgG

301

concentrations were approximately normally distributed with few outliers and a low level of

302

censoring, justifying use of Pearson’s correlation and linear regression. Left censored values

303

were given a value of half the level of detection, which corresponded to the first dilution for

304

each neutralization assay. Student’s t test was also on log-transformed values. Association of

305

neutralization and IgG concentration with age and BMI were conducted using Spearman’s

306

rank-based correlation and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests were used to compare neutralization

307

and IgG in two groups of individuals (e.g. gender, presence of symptom score >2). Statistical

308

significance was determined based on a p-value < 0.05.

(84%) people consented and completed the enrollment survey. Of these, 967 participants

315

presented for specimen collection between May 4-19, 2020, and 222 (22.8 %) with blood

316

drawn had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein according to the Abbott Architect test

317

(index value ≥1.40).Out of these, we randomly selected forty positive samples to evaluate

318

different platforms of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody assays. Participants had a median

319

age of 51.5 years and a range between 23 and 81 years (Table 1). According to the survey,

320

only one participant reported being hospitalized and four participants (10%) were self-

321

described as asymptomatic. Among participants reporting different symptoms (Table S1),

322

57.5% had fever while fatigue (87.5%), cough (72.5%), headache (67.5%) and chills (65%)

323

were more prevalent. Based on this, our cohort can be described as representing mild-to-

324

moderate symptomatic infections.

325

Cell-based assays provided comparable estimates of neutralization activity. We tested

326

forty heat-inactivated plasma samples in four different cell-based neutralization assays each

327

with a different pair of target cells and virus (Table 2): live recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-

328

CoV-2-nLuc) with Vero E6 cells, a lentivirus pseudotyped by SARS-CoV-2 spike (LV-

329

pseudovirus) with HEK 293T cells expressing human ACE2 (293T/ACE2) or TZM-bl cells

330

expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (TZM-bl/ACE2/TMPRSS2) and a vesicular stomatitis

Fifty percent neutralizing dilution (ND50) is a standard numerical parameter to compare virus-

337

neutralization is observed, are used together. We serially diluted plasma samples to generate

338

titration curves and estimated ND50 and ND80 relative to positive and negative controls (Fig.

339

S1–S3). All four cell-based neutralization assays performed comparably and generated

340

titration curves necessary for ND50 and ND80 estimation using a four-parameter logistic model

341

(Fig. S1–S3). On average, the slope parameter for neutralization curves with rSARS-CoV-2-

342

nLuc was higher compared to other assays (slope B=3.3 vs. 0.6, 1.4, 1.5 for LV-pseudo/293T,

343

LV-pseudo/TZM-bl and VSV-pseudo/Vero, respectively; all p < 0.001). Geometric mean ND50

344

from the assay with rSARS-CoV-2-nLuc (141, 95% CI 94-213) did not differ (p=0.2) from the

345

LV-pseudo/293T assay (178, 95%CI 112-283; Fig. 1A, Fig. S4A). However, the LV-

346

pseudo/TZM-bl assay showed significantly lower geometric mean ND50s compared to LV-

347

pseudo/293T (Fig. 1A, Fig. S4A). The VSV-pseudo/Vero assay produced significantly higher

348

ND50 values (geometric mean ND50 of 310, 95%CI 211-454) compared to both the SARS-

349

CoV-2/VeroE6 assay and the two LV-pseudovirus assays (Fig. S4A) suggesting that it is

350

easier to neutralize VSV-based pseudovirus in Vero cells compared to other approaches.

351

The assay platforms also differed in their capacity to detect neutralization. In the live-virus

352

assay, LV-pseudo/293T and LV-pseudo/TZM-bl neutralization was detectable at the lowest

353

dilution for 31, 37, and 34 samples, respectively, and therefore permitted estimation of the

354

ND50; ND50 of the remaining samples was censored at the lowest dilution (Fig. 1A). In

355

contrast, VSV-pseudo/Vero permitted estimation of ND50 for all 40 samples (Fig. 1A). With the

356

sVNT, only 31 of 40 samples showed neutralization above 20%, a negative cutoff value

357

according to the manufacturer’s protocol, at the lowest dilution 1:10 (Fig. S3A). To estimate

358

ND50, we selected 13 of these 31 samples and tested them in serial dilutions (Fig. 1A, Fig.

359

S3B). Samples were selected to represent different percent neutralization observed at 1:10

360

dilution. The resulting ND50 was significantly lower (29.5 95%CI 18.2-47.9) than in the cell-

361

based assays, further supporting the conclusion that the surrogate assay had lower sensitivity

362

compared to the cell-based assays.

363

We used the same 4PL models to estimate ND80 titers. Though ND80 was consistently lower,

364

the correlation with ND50 was high ranging from Pearson’s r=0.87 for the live-virus assay to

365

r=0.97 for the VSV-pseudovirus assay. Similar to ND50, the ND80 titers also differed among

366

the assays (Fig. 1B, Fig. S4B) with the SARS-CoV-2/VeroE6 assay reporting the lowest

367

number of samples with ND80 titers above the limit of detection (24/40) and VSV-pseudovirus

368

assay showing the highest (39/40). The live-virus assay also showed the smallest difference

369

between ND50 and ND80 titers (Fig. S5, Table S2), a direct consequence of the steeper

370

titration curves observed for this assay (Fig. S1A). For pseudovirus-utilizing assays the

371

difference between ND50 and ND80 was greater and ranged between 2.7 and 4.2-fold. Due to

372

inability to reach 80% neutralization for the many samples in sVNT, we could not calculate

373

ND80 (Fig. S3).

374

Strong correlation among neutralization assays. Next, we conducted a correlation analysis

375

of the ND50 and ND80 values derived from each of the five neutralization assays (Fig. 2, Fig.

376

S6). The live-virus and all three pseudovirus neutralization assays generated ND50 values that

377

were highly correlated across samples (Pearson r = 0.81 – 0.89) with the highest correlation

378

observed between the two LV-pseudovirus assays (Pearson r = 0.89, 95% CI [0.81, 0.94],

379

p<0.001). ND50 reported by the sVNT showed the lowest correlation with the ND50 values

380

from the cell-based assays (Pearson r = 0.41 – 0.60). In contrast, correlation was greater

381

between the percent neutralization measured at 1:10 dilution and the outcomes of the cell-

382

based assays (Pearson r = 0.73 – 0.80); correlation between ND50 and percent neutralization

383

at 1:10 dilution was modest (r = 0.59).

384

Similar correlation was observed for ND80 outcomes for cell-based assays (Fig. 2B) with

385

Person’s r ranging between 0.69 – 0.88. Only a few samples showed neutralization greater

386

than 80% in sVNT (Fig. S3) and thus correlation between sVNT ND80 and other assays was

387

not estimated.

388

Plasma concentration of IgG binding antibodies correlated with neutralization potency.

389

Prior studies of SARS-CoV-2 individuals showed that the serum titer of spike and RBD-binding

390

IgG antibodies was a correlate of neutralizing potency (14, 34, 35). Using quantitative,

391

Luminex-based immunoassay, we measured concentration of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD

392

and nucleoprotein in each of the serum samples; IgG to tetanus toxoid was also measured as

393

a proxy for overall IgG level and state of humoral immunity (Fig. 1C). The mean concentration

394

of nucleoprotein-specific IgG measured in the Luminex assay was 7.3 µg/ml (95%CI [5.3, 10])

395

while the concentration of both spike and RBD IgG was lower at 2.8 (95%CI [1.9 – 4.1]) and

396

2.1 µg/ml (95%CI [1.4, 3.3]), respectively. Concentration of tetanus-specific IgG was higher

397

than IgG to SARS-CoV-2 antigens for all individuals (mean 14.5, 95%CI [11.1, 18.9]). Although

398

Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay is designed and used for qualitative detection of IgG against

399

the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, the instrument reports index values that can be used in

400

quantitative analyses (Fig. 1D).

401

Pearson correlation analysis revealed that levels of RBD and spike IgG correlated strongly

402

(Pearson’s r = 0.89, 95% CI [0.81, 0.94]) (Fig. 2A). Nucleoprotein-specific IgG measured in our

Luminex immunoassay was highly correlated with the quantitative index of the Abbott Architect

404

nucleoprotein IgG assay (Pearson’s r = 0.95, 95% CI [0.91, 0.97]). Correlation between levels

405

of nucleoprotein IgG measured either in Luminex or Abbott assay moderately correlated with

406

concentration of spike and RBD-specific IgG with Abbott indexes showing higher r values

407

(Pearson’s r ranging 0.58 –0.68). There was no significant correlation of tetanus-specific IgG

408

with SARS-CoV-2 spike, spike RBD or nucleoprotein IgG (all p > 0.05).

409

We then examined the relationship between concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and virus

410

neutralization (Fig. 2, Fig. S7). We found that IgG concentrations to each of the SARS-CoV-2

411

antigen was positively correlated with neutralization potency measured with each of the

412

neutralization assays (Pearson’s r = 0.46 – 0.83; Fig. 2A). The correlation of live-virus

413

neutralization ND50 with concentration of spike (Pearson r = 0.83, 95% CI [0.7, 0.91]) and

414

RBD-specific (0.83 95% CI [0.7, 0.91]) IgG was comparable to the correlations observed with

415

the other neutralization assays. Nucleoprotein-specific IgG concentration as well as the

416

quantitative index from the Abbott test were only moderately correlated with ND50 obtained in

417

cell-based assays, with r ranging between 0.46 – 0.63. In contrast the correlation of

418

nucleoprotein-specific IgG was higher with the percent neutralization measured with the sVNT

419

(Luminex, Pearson’s r = 0.69, 95% CI [0.49, 0.83] and Abbott, r = 0.76, 95% CI [0.54, 0.85]).

against SARS-CoV-2 (36). We asked whether ND50 titers obtained from each neutralization

427

found a moderate positive correlation between age and concentrations of spike-specific

428

(Spearman’s rho=0.37, p=0.02), spike RBD-specific (rho=0.39, p=0.013) and nucleoprotein-

429

specific (rho=0.45, p=0.003) IgG. Similarly, there were positive correlations between age and

430

neutralization titer, though the correlations tended to be higher with ND80 compared to ND50

431

titer (Fig. 3). For example, the correlation coefficient of age with live-virus neutralization ND80

432

was rho=0.51 (p=0.001), compared to rho=0.28 (p=0.075) for ND50. No consistent significant

Discussion

437

In this study we conducted a detailed comparison of different SARS-CoV-2 neutralization

438

assays using a set of 40 plasma samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals

439

with mild-to-moderate disease involved in a county-wide outbreak of COVID-19. These data

440

show a high level of congruency among cell-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. The

441

50% and 80% neutralization titer readouts of cell-based assays were highly correlated with

442

each other and with the concentration of RBD and spike-specific IgG. The results of the

443

ELISA-based sVNT were also positive correlated with the other neutralization assays, however

444

the correlation was modest in comparison. Though levels of spike-specific IgG were highly

445

correlated with neutralization, this does not indicate that all spike-specific binding IgG have

446

neutralization activity, rather it implies that individuals who produce spike-specific binding

447

antibodies are also likely to make neutralizing IgG. The correlation between nucleoprotein-

448

specific IgG and neutralization was consistently lower than the correlations of spike and spike

449

RBD-specific IgG with neutralization. This is consistent with known mechanisms of

450

neutralization, which involve binding and/or blocking the spike:ACE2 receptor binding domain;

451

the moderate correlations of nucleoprotein-specific IgG with neutralization may indicate that

452

presence of any SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG is a biomarker of the presence of neutralizing

453

antibodies as well. The association of age with both the plasma concentration of spike-specific

454

IgG and neutralization titer suggests that the previously reported association of high

455

neutralization titer among older individuals may be mediated by higher concentrations of spike

456

and spike RBD-specific IgG. Whether this is a result of prior infections with seasonal

457

coronaviruses or an effect of age on the developing immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is not

458

clear yet.

459

Previously, in a cohort of severely ill COVID-19 patients, deceased individuals were reported to

460

have higher concentrations of nucleoprotein- than spike- and RBD-specific IgG, and the

461

opposite scenario was associated with survival (37). In our study, individuals with mild-to-

462

moderate disease also demonstrated higher concentrations of nucleoprotein IgG compared to

463

spike and RBD IgG suggesting that the immune response to spike and nucleoprotein differ in

464

milder forms of disease. Of interest, we did not see any correlation between the neutralizing

465

potency of plasma and BMI. As our cohort was largely uniform with regard to disease severity,

466

our study cannot comment on the association between spike and nucleoprotein antibodies and

467

disease severity.

468

With the set of cell lines used for the assays in this study, we were able to address questions

469

regarding the influence of proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike on virus neutralization by

470

serum antibodies which is important for choosing an assay that would provide more

471

physiologically relevant outcomes. Although there was no significant difference observed in

472

virus titer at 48 h post infection on the wildtype Vero cells and Vero cells expressing furin, at

473

the early time point cells expressing protease showed a higher virus titer (9). Proteolytic

474

cleavage was also shown to be essential for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on other cell types (9, 17).

475

Therefore, cell lines expressing TMPRSS2 or a related protease would allow testing for the

476

possible role of proteolytic cleavage of the spike glycoprotein in virus infectivity. In contrast to

477

this reasoning, comparison of different cell types used for pseudovirus assays revealed that

478

the presence of TMPRSS2 is not critical for assay performance. As such, TZM-bl cells

479

designed to express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 showed no significant difference compared to

480

293T cells that do not express TMPRSS2 endogenously and were only expressing ACE2.

481

TZM-bl cells are widely used in HIV research for neutralization assays with both live viruses

482

and pseudoviruses due to the assay robustness and reproducibility (38, 39).

483

A neutralization platform based on Vero cells and VSV-pseudovirus demonstrated the highest

484

sensitivity among assays tested. This could be explained by lower affinity of interaction

485

between SARS-CoV-2 and simian ACE compared to the human ACE2 and by different density

486

of spike glycoprotein on the surface of VSV pseudovirus. While increased sensitivity may lead

487

to overestimation of neutralization potency, it can also be useful for specimens with low

488

neutralizing activity or when sample volume is limited such as for mucosal secretions and

489

washes. However, the high correlation between the live-virus assay and Vero/VSV-

490

pseudovirus assay suggests that data obtained in the latter can accurately reflect the sample

491

potency to neutralize wildtype SARS-CoV-2.

492

ELISA-based assays have two major limitations: i) inability to account for synergistic action of

493

antibodies targeting different epitopes; and ii) detection only of antibodies that block interaction

494

the virus glycoprotein (24, 40). For example, synergistic action of antibodies against RBD and

496

the S2 domain has been reported (41). There are two ways of performing such a surrogate

497

assay: soluble biotinylated ACE2 competing with serum antibodies for binding to immobilized

498

RBD or spike, or an opposite version with soluble RBD and immobilized ACE2 (21). Abe et al.

499

found that an assay with soluble ACE2 and immobilized RBD was more sensitive and yielded

500

ND50 values that correlated with ND50 titers obtained in the classical cell-based PRNT with a

501

coefficient of determination of 0.6. The GenScript assay that we have tested in our study

502

utilizes immobilized ACE2, which likely explains why we were not able to measure ND50 titers

503

for the majority of samples. Of note, samples used by Abe et al. were also collected from mild-

504

to-moderate COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, a surrogate assay can be used cautiously as

505

an alternative to cell-based assays to obtain preliminary qualitative results, to rapidly

506

distinguish between samples with high and low neutralizing potency, and when a cell-based

507

assay is not available or reasonably feasible.

plasma samples from 40 COVID-19 convalescent patients. (A) ND50 and (B) ND80

709

neutralization titer measured using five SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. Each assay

710

defined its own lower limit of detect (LOD) based on the initial dilution: 50-fold for SARS-CoV-

711

2/VeroE6, 20 for the LV and VSV pseudovirus assays and 10 for the sVNT. Data below the

712

LOD (open triangle) is plotted at LOD/2. Number and percent of samples above the LOD is

713

indicated above each plot. (C) Antigen-specific IgG concentration measured using a Luminex

714

bead-based assay. (D) Index values for each sample from the Abbott Architect nucleoprotein

715

IgG assay. For each assay the box represents the extend of the inter-quartile range (IQR) with

716

a line indicating the median; whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR.
