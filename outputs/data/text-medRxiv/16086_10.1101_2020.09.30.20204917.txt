ABSTRACT:
Background: Brazil has the third-highest number of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
cases worldwide. Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is
challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19
cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology.
Methods: We used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from
March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals
across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic
diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following:
fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a
suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage
weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of
COVID-19 cases.
Results: After calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19
occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported
ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human
development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19
cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively,
p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing.
Conclusion: In this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated
that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported. The estimated
per reported case ratios were higher in areas with worse socioeconomic status.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of
the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. This infectious disease was first
reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread to countries all over the
world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on
March 11, 2020, and approximately twenty-five million people have been infected by August
29, 2020.[1] With high transmissibility and absence of an effective antiviral therapy or
vaccine, the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded a rapid public health response to
implement effective methods of disease tracking to mitigate and contain the disease spread.
Although COVID-19 case reporting requires accurate testing using RT-PCR or serology,
widespread testing has shown to be impractical, with highly heterogeneous per-capita testing
rates across different regions in the world, depending on test production inputs, resources
and allocation constraints.[2] On the other hand, suspected COVID-19 cases can be
identified based on patient-reported symptoms and history of exposure to SARS-COV2,
which can be useful in a pandemic scenario, particularly in settings with test shortage.[3] This
approach can be implemented on a large scale using mobile apps and web-applications,
capable of reaching thousands of patients within days. Indeed, digital technology has been
used in the COVID-19 pandemic response in different ways, such as screening of infection,
contact tracing, predicting clinical outcomes and providing capacity for virtual care.[4] Digital
technology initiatives have been successfully applied in the United Kingdom, United States,
Germany and other countries, helping to track the disease spread in real time for a fraction of
the cost and with reasonable accuracy.[5-7] However, it is unknown whether digital health
technologies can help in developing countries, which face several challenges imposed by
socioeconomic factors, lack of availability of digital devices and limited access to the internet.

We, therefore, described the results from the largest web-based collaborative COVID-19
application in Brazil - called Together Against COVID. We used the Together Against COVID
database to estimate the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 cases in each Brazilian
federative unit, and compared them with the respective rates of reported cases. We also

pandemic in Brazil, the world's third most-hit country and the current epicenter of the
pandemic.
METHODS
Study Design and Population
This was a nationwide, large survey-based study including all brazilian federative units. On
March 21st, 2020, we started a non-governmental web-based application called Juntos
Contra

o

COVID

-

Against

in

available

in

juntoscontraocovid.org. After consenting, each participant filled in a form answering
questions on current symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. When they
completed the form, they had access to a map showing the location of suspected COVID-19
cases. Participants received a weekly email to update their symptom status.
The survey had no pre-specified eligibility criteria, ranging from all ages. No symptoms nor
prior known contact with the coronavirus was used as an inclusion criteria. Furthermore, no
exclusion criteria were predefined. Participants from all over the country were able to
contribute in a collaborative fashion. For this study, we presented data collected up to August
29th, 2020.
Recruitment Strategy
The primary recruitment method was the snowball strategy - where previous participants
invite known potential participants to enter the survey. This organic sampling method was

followed by social media engagement and news portals sharing. However, the latter served,
primarily, as a focus for the snowball recruitment strategy.
Two main strategies were used to enhance patient recruitment. The first relied on social
media and message platforms. Predetermined messages and images were created to
publicize the platform as a free, collaborative and useful tool - where people could navigate
through a map and check if their surroundings had suspected COVID-19 cases. This strategy
worked as a mainstream method to enhance individuals’ access to the web-platform, where
they were invited to participate in the research project, sharing their symptoms and health
information. The second strategy leaned on publicizing the platform in nationwide news
channels. The overall reach of the platform was over 5 million Brazilians.
Clinical and Socioeconomic Covariates
We collected data on self-reported age, gender, COVID-19 test result, fever, cough,
dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, comorbidities (diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular
disease, pulmonary disease, renal disease, rheumatic disease, cancer and chronic corticoid
use), close contact with suspected COVID-19 case, close contact with confirmed COVID-19
case, travel history to known COVID-19 community transmission area and residence
address. Each participant’s home address was geocoded, and matched to the respective
census block from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) database.[8] We
obtained each census block average income and number of individuals per household from
the 2010 Brazilian census.[8] Income level was displayed in 2010 Brazilian minimum wage
(equivalent to US$ 377.00).
Suspected COVID-19 case definition
We defined suspect COVID-19 cases based on the Brazilian Health Ministry's definition,
which is similar to the WHO's suspect case definition for global surveillance.[9, 10]
Accordingly, there are three scenarios where a patient is a suspected COVID-19 case:

I - Patient evolves with fever and at least one of the following signs and symptoms: cough,
dyspnea, nasal flaring; and travel history to local transmission area, according to WHO, up to
14 days before the first symptoms; or
II - Patient evolves with fever and at least one of the following signs and symptoms: cough,
dyspnea, nasal flaring; and close contact with a suspected COVID-19 case, up to 14 days
before the first symptoms; or
III - Patient evolves with fever or at least one of the following signs and symptoms: cough,
dyspnea, nasal flaring; and close contact with confirmed COVID-19 case, up to 14 days
before the first symptoms;
A participant who filled in any of the above rules was defined as a suspected COVID-19
case.
Data Management
All data were maintained on an AWS hosted Structured Query Language (SQL) database.
Participants were identified by an anonymous hash value created upon form completion. This
value was used to track multiple responses from the same user given a pre-established
email pattern.
Statistical Analysis
We performed a stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis to estimate the population
level prevalence of COVID-19 cases. A Federative unit was used as stratum, the census
block as the first stage (primary) sampling unit, and individuals as the second-stage sampling
unit. Sampling weights were defined by the inverse of the probability of at least one census
block response within each federative unit and the inverse of the probability of the individual
response within the respective census block. To account for selection bias from survey
responses, sampling weights were adjusted using the general regression method for

calibration with age, sex and census block average income level (< ½, ½ to <1, 1 to <2, 2 to
<3, 3 to <5, and 5 and above minimum wage) as auxiliary variables. Age- and sex-specific
population totals were obtained from the 2020 estimated population size for each federative
unit according to the IBGE.[8] Income level category-specific population totals were obtained
from the 2010 Census data. The model performance was checked by comparing the final
estimated average age, sex and income levels from the survey analysis with official
population data from IBGE Census.
From this model, we estimated the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 cases by
federative unit and compared them with the reported cases. Finally, we performed a logistic
regression model using the same survey-based approach to evaluate the association of
income level and number of individuals per household (< 2, 2 to < 3, and 3 and above) with
the rates of COVID-19 cases. The analyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (Stata
Corp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
From March 21 to August 29, we obtained responses from 243 461 individuals in 3277 cities
in Brazil, including all the 26 states and the Federal District (additional info in Supplementary
table 1). Among participants with suspected COVID-19, the most common symptom was
fever (76%) followed by cough (75%), anosmia (40%), ageusia (40%) and dyspnea (38%),
and 44% of them reported contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days
(Supplemental figure 1).
Table 1 shows the descriptive characteristics of the sample, along with data after survey
weighting and calibration methods, and the population demographics according to Brazilian
census.[11] Compared with Brazilian population, our sample had an over-representation of
women between 20 and 60 years old, and an under-representation of individuals younger
than 20 years old and older than 80 years old. Moreover, it was over-represented by
individuals living in regions with higher income per capita. After weighing and calibration, the

By August 29, 2020, the Ministry of Health reported 3,761,391 COVID-19 cases, as
displayed in Figure 1A. Nevertheless, we estimated that 10,339,461 cases occurred in the
same period, with different relative distributions among the federative units (Figure 1B, table
2). Overall, the ratio between the estimated and reported COVID-19 cases was 2.75:1 in
Brazil, but this ratio highly varied across states, with higher ratios in the states of Pará (PA),
Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Pernambuco (PE) (Figure 1C). In Mato Grosso (MT), Mato

Grosso do Sul (MS), Maranhão (MA), Amapá (AP) and Alagoas (AL) we estimated fewer
cases than officially reported (Figure 1C). The figure 1D displays the Human Development
Indexes (HDI) in each state according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
(IBGE)[8] with the lowest indexes in the North and Northeast regions. State-level
estimated/reported COVID-19 case ratios appeared to be inversely associated with HDI and
COVID-19 testing rates, with higher ratios in states with lower HDI and lower testing rates
(Figure 2).

upper-middle income regions and an uptrend from upper-middle (3 to < 5 minimum wage) to
the upper income stratum (5 and over minimum wage, figure 3A). The estimated COVID-19
rates in the lower income stratum were approximately three times higher than the rates in the
upper-middle income stratum (68 vs 20 per 1000 people) and twice the one in the upper
income stratum (68 vs 39 per 1000 people, Figure 3A). On the other hand, self-reported
COVID-19 testing was the most common in the highest income stratum (123 tests per 1000
people) compared to other strata (p<0.001, Figure 3B).
While the COVID-19 case rates were inversely associated with census-block average income
[Odds Ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.67, 0.82, p<0.001) per category
increase], they were directly associated with the average number of individuals living in the
same household (OR 1.94, 95% CI: 1.61, 2.36, p<0.001, per category increase, Table 2). In
a multivariate analysis, the association between COVID-19 case rates and income remained
similar after adjusting for number of individuals per household (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69, 0.87,
p<0.001)
The COVID-19 rates varied across age strata, with the highest rates in the population
between 20 and 39 years and the lowest ones between 60 and 79 years old. Noteworthy,
COVID-19 was more common among individuals with comorbidities, particularly those with
self-reported cardiovascular diseases, than those with no comorbidities (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the cumulative incidence rates of COVID19 using a web-based collaborative tool in Brazil. In this population-based survey, the
estimated COVID-19 case rate was 2.75 times higher than it has been reported. Underreporting of COVID-19 varied across states, as reflected by different estimated/reported
COVID-19 ratios, and it appears to be higher in states with lower HDI. The rates of COVID-

19 cases were higher in neighborhoods with lower income levels, but the rates of selfreported COVID-19 testing was almost twice higher in the highest income compared with the
lowest income neighborhoods. Our study shows how digital technology can help understand
the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Brazil, which could be replicated in other developing
countries. Better understanding of the factors leading to higher case rates among lower
income communities can help inform public authorities to better allocate resources and
develop strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Previous studies used digital technology to track COVID-19 cases based on self-reported
symptoms. A multinational Consortium involving a digital health care company and a
multidisciplinary team of scientists in the United States and the United Kingdom developed a
mobile app to provide real-time epidemiology of COVID-19 during the outbreak.[12] Data
from this app have shown that a symptom-based prediction model could estimate the time
changes in the incidence of COVID-19 cases days before the officially reported cases.[12]
Other countries in Asia and Europe have also implemented mobile apps for different
purposes, such as identification of potential cases and tracing contacts of COVID-19 patients
to recommend self-isolation.[13] Our study adds that digital technology can be combined with
official data to detect the spread of COVID-19 earlier and identify the most affected areas.
Previous studies also suggested under-reporting of COVID-19 cases using sero-prevalence
and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) data.[14-17] A population-based study in
Southern Brazil estimated that, for each reported case, there were approximately 10
infections, as reflected by the prevalence of individuals who tested positive for anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG antibodies, similar to what has been found in other countries.[15,17]
Asymptomatic cases - 15% to 40% of COVID-19 infections - can only partially account for
these differences.[14] A study from the Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica
da Gripe (SIVEP-Gripe) system found an increase in SARI cases with unknown etiology in
Brazil from March to May, 2020 that were 2.3-fold higher than the SARI due to COVID19.[18] In the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo in the southern of Brazil, confirmed COVID-

19 diagnosis among SARI cases was less likely in areas with lower per-capita income.
Similarly, our study found that COVID-19 case rates from self-reported symptoms were 2.75fold higher than the reported cases, with higher estimated/reported ratios in states with lower
HDI and lower testing rates.[18] This may imply non-equitable access to testing and
diagnosis, but the reasons for under-reporting of COVID-19 are complex and multifactorial,
involving both healthcare delivery, cultural aspects and socioeconomic characteristics.
We showed a significant association between COVID-19 case rates and socioeconomic
factors. Areas with lower income and more people living in the same house were associated
with higher rates of COVID-19. Social distancing may be seemingly impossible in small,
overcrowded and poorly ventilated houses with a single room, enhancing the transmission of
respiratory viruses whenever a family member develops symptoms.[19-21] Although there is
a lack of data on the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in poor communities, a study suggested
that a hypothetical pandemic of a new strain of influenza would have greater impact in a lowincome country, such as Papua New Guinea, than in a developed country, mainly due to a
larger number of individuals per household.[19] Consistent with this hypothesis, the
prevalence of COVID-19 was not associated with income strata and number of individuals
per household in the seroprevalence study in Spain.[14] This suggests that the higher
transmissibility in crowded households may particularly affect lower-income countries. Policy
strategies that address crowded households when an individual is tested positive can be
important tactics to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in low-income settings. On the other
hand, our data showed that the association between COVID-19 rates and income remained
almost unchanged after adjusting for the number of individuals per household, suggesting
that other factors play an important role in this association.
We found that the COVID-19 case rates were higher, but testing rates were lower, among
census blocks with lower average income. This underscores the heterogeneous access to
healthcare even when there is universal health coverage. Individuals in the lower income
strata, who were at higher risk of COVID-19, were less likely to receive testing and, therefore,

to self-isolate.[22] In addition to the disease itself, poor communities face difficulties indirectly
caused by the pandemic, such as a drastic reduction in income and a loss of community
targeted support.[23] Besides that, low-income people may be more reluctant to social
isolation due to: family responsibilities as a food and wage provider; less flexible jobs; fear of
losing their position and lack of formal jobs.[24-26]
Digital technology can be a powerful tool to quickly provide valuable epidemiological
information at a low cost. Disease tracking, contact tracing, diagnosis support, clinical status
monitoring and telemedicine are among applications that have been implemented in different
countries to fight against this pandemic.[4] The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be
worse in low income settings with weaker healthcare systems, which will increase the world
health disparities due to the effect of the negative social determinants. Despite the concerns
on limited access to the internet, we demonstrated that low-cost digital initiatives coupled
with effective social engagement can be extremely useful to provide important data on
disease activity in a developing country with continental proportions.
Our study has limitations that deserve attention. First, we used a web-based application that
relies on spontaneous survey responses. Although access to the internet has been reported
in 79% of households in Brazil, our sample was under-represented by elderly and lowincome individuals.[30] Appropriate weighing and calibration helped mitigate this limitation,
as estimated demographics became similar to census-based population data. Second, most
COVID-19 cases were defined by self-reported symptoms and history of contact with a
suspected/confirmed case, which may overestimate the number of symptomatic infections
and does not account for asymptomatic infections. Nevertheless, this strategy is a feasible
approach to evaluate large population-based surveys, particularly in settings with insufficient
tests for screening every suspected case, such as most regions in the world during this
pandemic. Finally, a noteworthy aspect of this initiative was its collaborative and non-profit
nature. Over 30 professionals and over 10 companies from various fields gathered resources
and expertise to help brazilians stay aware of their surroundings while also contributing to

science. This study proves that it is possible to conduct nationwide high-level research in
developing countries with limited resources.
What is already known in this subject?
- Developed countries have successfully used digital technologies to gain insights about
epidemiological and clinical data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic
- There is limited evidence on the use of such technologies in developing countries.
What this study adds?
- More than 240.000 patients were assessed for COVID-19 symptoms and epidemiological
data in Brazil using a low cost digital web-application.
- It proved to be a safe and viable method in developing countries, such as Brazil,
enabling insights on under notification and the impacts of wage on infection and testing.

Distribution of officially reported (A) and survey-based estimated (B) COVID-19 cases per 1000
inhabitants according to the federative unit, ratios between reported and estimated cases (C) and the
Human Development Index (D) according to the federative unit. The highest rates of COVID-19 cases
were observed in the North and Northeastern regions, but the number of estimated cases was higher
than reported in all federative units. The estimated/reported COVID-19 ratios were higher in the
Northeastern region, particularly in states with lower Human Development Indexes.
