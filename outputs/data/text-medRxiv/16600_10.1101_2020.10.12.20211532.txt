Abstract

26

Background: As the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the US,

27

policymakers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts

28

multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of online crowdfunding to defray these

29

costs. We examined the online crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19

30

pandemic in the US.

31

Methods: On May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns created

32

between January 1 and May 10, 2020 on GoFundMe and identified the subset of COVID-related

33

campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored incidence of

34

COVID-related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time and compared campaign

35

characteristics to non-COVID-related campaigns after March 11 when the pandemic was

36

declared.

37

Results: We found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe online

38

crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-related campaigns. However,

39

as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19

40

cases declined more than tenfold across all states. COVID-related campaigns raised more money,

41

had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other

42

campaigns in the study period.

43

Conclusions: Online crowdfunding appears to be a transient stopgap, predicated on the novelty

44

of an emergency rather than the true sustained need of a community. Rather, crowdfunding

45

activity is likely an early marker for communities in acute distress that could be used by

46

governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.

71

Background

72

As the number of coronavirus 2019 cases (COVID-19) precipitously accelerated in

73

March throughout the United States (US), government and public health departments marshalled

74

their pandemic responses. Support efforts quickly became necessary as shortages of medical

75

supplies and testing worsened by the continued spread of the virus affected health care

76

organizations, medical offices, and nursing homes(1). While the first effects of the pandemic

77

were health-related, the economic ramifications including rapidly increasing unemployment and

78

loss of revenue quickly followed the spread of the disease and public health efforts to contain

79

it(2,3). Temporary and permanent closure of small businesses, furloughing whole sectors of the

80

economy (e.g. airline and restaurant industries), and food price inflation added social, financial,

81

and medical strains to the population(4,5). Subsequent effects of the pandemic such as the

82

increased number of deaths and associated funeral costs added additional financial stress to the

83

lives of Americans.

84

Online crowdfunding has become an increasingly popular tool to finance medical

85

treatment, respond to financial hardships and natural disasters, and defray the downstream

86

economic impacts of personal healthcare costs(6,7). Despite anecdotal reports of the increased

87

use of online crowdfunding to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19(8), details on if and

88

how crowdfunding has been used for COVID-19 relief efforts remain unclear. We evaluate

89

online crowdfunding campaigns in the US in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic on the

90

GoFundMe platform, which represents 90% of the social crowdfunding market in the US as of

91

2018(9).

93

We extracted (on May 16, 2020) all active US campaigns created between January 1 and

94

May 10, 2020 on GoFundMe, the largest online crowdfunding platform in the US. The time

95

frame reflects approximately 2 months before and after the World Health Organization (WHO)

96

declaration of the pandemic on March 11, 2020. We used the BeautifulSoup library(10) to web

97

scrape all data available for the GoFundMe campaigns and excluded all campaigns that

98

originated outside the US. We list all extracted data fields in Appendix Table 1. We used

99

keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify and label the subset of COVID-related

100

campaigns (Appendix Table 2). The University of Texas Southwestern Human Research

101

Protection Program Policies, Procedures, and Guidance did not require institutional review board

102

approval as all data were publicly available.

103

We examined weekly new COVID-related campaigns juxtaposed with the weekly new

104

COVID-19 cases both nationally and by state or territory. We evaluated the incidence of

105

campaigns by state adjusted for new COVID-19 cases by week to determine the relationship

106

between disease burden and campaign initiation. To allow for comparison among states, we

107

defined week 0 as the first week that each state had at least 100 new weekly cases. We displayed

108

all states, but only highlighted the top six states by overall campaigns by million. Given the

109

presence of zip code level data, we also explored more granular community trends. We also

110

evaluated changes in COVID-related campaigns per million for each state and campaign

111

categories over time.

112

We compared campaign characteristics, including fundraising, campaign information,

113

and campaign category, for COVID-19 and non-COVID-related campaigns over the same time

114

period from March 11th to May 10th. We used Mann-Whitney U, ߯ , and Fisher’s exact testing

115

where appropriate to determine significance. Alpha level of significance was set a priori at 0.05

and all hypothesis testing was two-sided. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons as this was

117

an exploratory study and should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating. Analyses were

118

performed using Python, version 3.7.2 (Python Software Foundation).

119

Results

120

Of 310,695 total new campaigns created between January 1 and May 10, 2020, we

121

analyzed 232,827 campaigns from the US across all categories. Twenty-two percent of these or

122

51,763 campaigns were identified as COVID-related and collectively raised $237,418,235 by

123

May 10, 2020. The vast majority of COVID related campaigns were established after March 11th

124

(50,828 or 98.2%). New GoFundMe campaigns had a peak in mid-March, mainly due to new

125

campaigns related to or referencing COVID-19 and declined in April (Figure 1). This COVID-

126

related increase in campaigns was observed before the national peak of new COVID-19 cases in

127

April. Subsequently, the incidence of new campaigns declined while the incidence of new

128

COVID-19 cases remained steady or declined slightly.

129

Adjusting for the weekly incidence of COVID-19 cases, all US states had their peak of

130

new COVID-related campaigns within 2 weeks of their first week when 100 new cases were

131

diagnosed in that state. For many states, the rate of COVID-related campaigns per case dropped

132

by at tenfold after the first 2 to 3 weeks (Figure 2). Population rich states that also had early

133

spread of COVID-19 like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Washington, and Illinois had

134

the most COVID-related campaigns per million inhabitants (Figure 3), but were ultimately

135

among the states with the lowest COVID-related campaigns per 1,000 cases during the study

136

period.

137

From March 11th to May 10th 2020, non-COVID-related campaigns (n=91,631) raised a

138

median of $625 ((interquartile range [IQR], $135–$2300) while COVID-related campaigns

139

(n=50,828) raised a median of $930 IQR, $220–$3,075), nearly 50% more per campaign (p <

140

0.001). Fundraising goals were higher in COVID-related (median [IQR], $5,000 [$2,000 to

141

$10,000]) than non-COVID-related (median [IQR], $4,000 [$1,250 to $10,000]) campaigns (p

142

<0.001). Even with the higher fundraising goals, COVID-related campaigns (median [IQR],

143

25.0% [5.5% to 69.5%]) raised a higher percent of the fundraising goal than non-COVID-related

144

campaigns (median [IQR], 22.2% [5.0% to 65.5%]) by date of data extraction (p <0.001).

145

COVID-related campaigns (median [IQR], 23 [0–163]) had significantly more Facebook shares

146

than non-COVID-related campaigns (0 [0–145]) (p <0.001). COVID-related campaigns also had

147

a longer narrative in their campaign description, were more likely to be listed as a charity, and

148

more likely to have the campaigner be the same as the beneficiary (Table 1).

149

Creators of COVID-related campaigns selected the following categories most commonly

150

(in descending order by number of campaigns): 1) Accidents & Emergencies, 2) Medical Illness

151

& Healing, 3) Community & Neighbors, 3) Business & Entrepreneurs, 5) Funerals & Memorials

152

(Exhibit 5). Accidents & Emergencies as well as Community & Neighbors Medical Illness &

153

Healing had the earliest peaks (Figure 4a). A week later, the category Business & Entrepreneurs

154

peaked, but this appeared to be driven by an isolated spike on March 24th (Figure 4b). Medical

155

Illness & Healing peaked next within the following 2 weeks. As these initial spikes decreased

156

significantly, Funerals & Memorials campaigns lagged the first peak by 4 weeks. Compared to

157

non-COVID-related campaigns after March 11th, COVID-related campaigns had more

158

campaigns in Accidents & Emergencies, Community & Neighbors, and Business and

159

Entrepreneurs and less campaigns in Funerals & Memorials and Animals & Pets.

161

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, people were more likely to create COVID-19

162

campaigns. There was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe online crowdfunding

163

campaigns in March, mostly attributable to COVID-related campaigns. COVID-related

164

campaigns raised more money than other campaigns, had a longer narrative description, and

165

were more likely to be shared on Facebook. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed,

166

its novelty wore off. As COVID-19 became a familiar ubiquitous problem, the number of

167

campaigns per COVID-19 cases declined across all states. This observation may be explained by

168

potential campaign developers weighing the effort required to create a campaign with a shrinking

169

potential for reward. Initially, the novelty and uniqueness of COVID-19 cases and with it, the

170

chance of a campaign to “go viral”, reach many people, and generate large donations may have

171

convinced potential campaign builders that COVID-related illness or financial hardships might

172

be perceived as causes that others would support. As the issue became widespread and the

173

ability to set a campaign apart as a worthy cause became more difficult, the effort (cost) of

174

creating a campaign may have been outweighed by the perceived likelihood of funding. As

175

others have found, the concept of worthiness and augmenting one’s “illness narrative” become

176

important factors in generating campaign appeal, influence, and ultimately fundraising

177

success(11–13). The states with the earliest disease burden had the least campaigns per case

178

indicating a lack of a case-dependent response, supporting the hypothesis that potential campaign

179

designers perceive common illnesses as less likely to receive the attention of donors over time.

180

While raising millions of dollars, our study suggests that online crowdfunding does not

181

function as a true financial safety net. Medical expenses related to COVID-19 in the US are

182

estimated to be in excess of $163 billion if 20% of the population were to be infected (on August

183

26, 2020, approximately 1.8% of the population had a confirmed infection)(14). Rather,

184

crowdfunding more likely functions as a weathervane indicating a novel crisis. Further,

185

crowdfunding is heavily swayed by marketing and storytelling as it points a majority of the funds

186

towards a few cases rather than aiding the many(8,15).

187

The large number of categories for COVID-related GoFundMe campaigns tells a

188

poignant story of the broad, destructive effect that COVID-19 had on society. Beyond creating

189

the need to cover unexpected costly medical expenses, COVID-19 devastated small businesses,

190

skyrocketed unemployment, created food and housing insecurities, generated unexpected

191

expenses such as funeral costs, and increased debt(5). The campaign categories reflected the

192

progression of the COVID-19 funding response with the earliest peaks for accidents and

193

emergencies and the late growth and plateau for funerals and memorials. Spike in business

194

campaigns was likely heavily based around the launch of the Small Business Relief Initiative on

195

March 2(16).

196

As newly generated GoFundMe campaigns showed a temporal correlation to the

197

pandemic’s effect on society, we contemplated that GoFundMe campaigns may actually serve as

198

an early marker for any community in distress. To explore this hypothesis, we isolated

199

campaigns from smaller communities that have been affected by a natural disaster including

200

Puerto Rico (earthquake from January 6-7, 2020), Nashville (tornado from March 2-3, 2020),

201

and Mississippi (tornado from April 12-13, 2020). We were able to discern an immediate peak

202

for GoFundMe campaigns following each event (Appendix Figure 1).

203

While GoFundMe campaigns failed to meet the needs of those seeking support as

204

demonstrated by the small fraction of funding goals met by data extraction date, it appears

205

however to be an accurate, early marker for a community, region, state, or country in distress.

206

This measure is not limited to medical emergencies and extends to natural disasters. Future

207

research will show what type of negative events that affect communities may be reflected by a

208

spike in GoFundMe campaigns. We propose the development of a measure using rapid rise in

209

new GoFundMe campaigns as an early indicator of community distress.

210

While we were able to analyze the full available set of GoFundMe campaigns, which

211

strengthened our study, it had several limitations. First, we used data from one crowdfunding

212

platform only. While GoFundMe is the largest platform in the US by number of campaigns, our

213

study may have suffered from selection bias. Because of the large number of campaigns, we are

214

unable to validate that campaigns using COVID-related keywords were indeed designed to

215

mitigate the effect of COVID-19. Moreover, while we note significant differences in campaign

216

and funding characteristics between COVID-related and non-COVID-related campaigns, future

217

work will be important to further understand reasons for these differences and their implications

218

on long-term crowdfunding. Lastly, we only analyze the first few months of COVID-related

219

campaigns; therefore, more longitudinal analysis will be important to understand more

220

completely how peaks and troughs in COVID-19 incidence nationally and in particular,

221

communities affect campaign frequency.

222

Conclusions

223

Online crowdfunding activity leverages a galvanized public reaction early in a public

224

health emergency like COVID-19. However, as disease spread persists and economic burden

225

continues to grow nationally, the creation of new campaigns fades. Online crowdfunding appears

226

to be a transient stopgap, predicated on the novelty of an emergency rather than the true

227

sustained need of a community.

228

More importantly than its rather weak effect of mitigating the effect of the crisis,

229

crowdfunding activity is likely an early marker for communities in acute distress. It could be

230

monitored by local, state, and federal government agencies such as Federal Emergency

231

Management Association (FEMA) as an early marker for emergencies and need for support.

232

Future research will determine what emergencies generate the strongest signals in crowdfunding

233

activities.
