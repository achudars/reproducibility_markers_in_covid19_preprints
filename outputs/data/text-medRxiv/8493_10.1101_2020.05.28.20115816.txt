Summary

14

Online-available information has been considered an accessory tool to estimate

15

epidemiology and collect data on diseases and population behavior patterns. This study

16

aimed to explore the potential use of Google and YouTube relative search volume to

17

predict social distancing index in Brazil during COVID-19 outbreak and verify the

18

correlation between social distancing measures with the course of the epidemic. Data

19

concerning the social distancing index, epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Brazil and

20

the search engines trends for “Coronavirus” were retrieved from online databases.

21

Multiple linear regression was performed and resulted in a statistically significant model

22

evidencing that Google and YouTube relative search volumes are predictors of the social

23

distancing index. The Spearman correlation test revealed a weak correlation between

24

social distancing measures and the course of the COVID-19 epidemic. Health authorities

25

can apply these data to define the proper timing and location for practicing appropriate

26

risk communication strategies.

Introduction

29

The World Health Organization have recently declared South America as the new

30

coronavirus epicenter, mainly because of the situation in Brazil that registers the most

31

cases and deaths in Latin America [1]. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, robust risk

32

communication is urgently needed particularly in the most affected countries [2]. Internet

33

query platforms, which allows to interact with internet-based data, have been considered

34

a source of potentially useful and accessible resources, especially aimed to identify

35

outbreaks and implement intervention strategies [3, 4]. Online-available information has

36

been considered as a surrogate tool for estimating epidemiology and gathering data about

37

patterns of disease and population behavior [5-7].

38

As the online queries on COVID-19 increases globally reflecting the interest of

39

people to be aware about this emerging infectious disease, mining online data and search

40

patterns on electronic resources might provide a better support to manage this worldwide

41

health crisis [8]. Internet searches and social media data have been reported to correlate

42

with traditional surveillance data and can even predict the outbreak of disease epidemics

43

several days or weeks earlier [9]. Evidence points that Google Trends could potentially

44

define the proper timing and location for practicing appropriate risk communication

45

strategies for affected populations and be employed to predict outbreak trends of the novel

46

coronavirus [2, 5, 10].

47

Previous investigations reported the use of Internet search engines as source of data

48

for public health surveillance and diseases incidence prediction worldwide, as zika, in

49

Brazil and Colombia [11]; influenza, in the United States [12]; malaria, dengue fever and

50

chikungunya, in India [13]; and Middle East respiratory syndrome, in Korea [14].

51

However, there are no reports on assessing the relative search volume (RSV) of search

52

engines to predict social distancing behavior during infectious diseases outbreaks.

53

Predictions might support in health resource management and planning for

54

prevention purposes [5]. As COVID-19 treatment protocol is still uncertain it is especially

55

important to prevent the virus dissemination in society [15]. Currently, the virus spread

56

prevention approaches focus on hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine [16].

57

Social distancing is designed to reduce interactions between people in a broader

58

community, in which individuals may be infectious but have not yet been identified hence

59

not yet isolated. This measure is particularly useful in settings where community

60

transmission is believed to have occurred, but where the linkages between cases is

61

unclear, and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is

62

considered insufficient to prevent further transmission [15, 17, 18]. Collective infection

63

control measures can reduce the disease incidence, though at the price of a prolongation

64

of the epidemic period [19]. Therefore, it is important to raise information on these

65

measures.

66

A recent study that assessed the impact of online information on the individual-

67

level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic concluded that in order to

68

enhance individuals' motivation to adopt preventive measures such as social distancing,

69

actions should focus on raising consciousness on the severity of the situation, in addition,

70

information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping

71

perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention [20]. Thus, the aim of the

72

present investigation was to predict social distancing index (SDI) through Google and

73

YouTube search trends and investigate the correlation between the SDI with

74

epidemiological data on COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil.

75

Methods

76

In Brazil, the current market share of Google among the search engines is over 97%

77

[21]. Google Trends (https://trends.google.com/trends/) data is a randomly collected

78

sample of Google search queries, each piece of data is categorized and tagged with a

79

topic. Each data point is divided by the total searches in a specific location over a time

80

period to compare relative popularity. Google Trends portrays search frequency output

81

as a normalized data series and the resulting numbers are scaled on a range of 0 to 100

82

based on a topic proportion to all searches on all topics. Scores represents search interest

83

relative to the highest point on the graph for that time period and geographic location. A

84

value of 100 is the peak popularity of a term. A value of 50 indicates that the term is half

85

as popular as it was at its peak of popularity [22]. This same methodology was applied to

86

YouTube search trends. To the present investigation the Brazilian Portuguese

87

correspondent topic for “coronavirus”, which held most popularity, was used.

88

The Social Distancing Index was created to help combat the spread of COVID-19,

89

since its launch it has been improved with the sole objective of providing an increasingly

90

accurate data for public authorities and research institutes. In order to achieve the index,

91

highly accurate geolocation data was treated with a distance algorithm. Polygons from all

92

regions of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics were adopted in order to

93

ensure a more accurate categorization and more reliable data [23]. Data is available on

94

Inloco website, displayed as map and chart.

95

Epidemiological data concerning COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil were collected

96

from the Brazilian government Health Ministry database, available online [24]. Statistical

97

data on daily new cases, cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and

98

recovered cases were retrieved.

99
100

All databases were assessed for data collection on 23 May 2020, and the
information corresponds to the period from 23 February to 20 May 2020.

101

Data were submitted to statistical analysis, all tests were applied considering an

102

error of 5% and the confidence interval of 95%, and the analyzes were carried out using

103

SPSS software version 23.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). Although the hypothesis of

104

normal distribution of data was not confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the

105

statistical analysis was performed by the application of nonparametric tests. The strength

106

of the association between distinct measures was tested with Spearman rank correlation.

107

Multiple linear regression was performed to verify whether Google and YouTube relative

108

search volumes are predictors of the social distancing index in Brazil.

109

Results

110

The multiple linear regression analysis resulted in a statistically significant model

111

[F (2,85) = 32,045; p<0.001; R2=0.430]. Therefore, Google RSV (β = 1.226; t = 7.887;

112

p<0.001) and YouTube RSV (β = -0.930; t = -5.980; p<0.001) are predictors of the social

113

distancing index in Brazil. The equation that describes this relationship is (SDI) = 34.347

114

+ 0.422 (Google RSV) + (-0.359) (YouTube RSV).

115

In Brazil for the time span analyzed the mean SDI score was approximately 43%,

116

the maximum of social distancing observed during this period was 62.2%. In mean scores

117

over 3312 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed daily. In the moment of data

118

collection, the reported total number of cumulative deaths, confirmed cases and recovered

119

cases were 18859, 291579 and 116683, respectively. The mean values of search engines

120

RSV are shown in table 1.

121

Correlation between SDI and the other studied variables was found to be varying

122

from weak to moderate, statistically significant correlation was found with all measures

123

tested except for cumulative recovered cases, as shown in table 2.

125

Evidence suggests that collective isolation measures have been highly effective in

126

controlling the spread of the COVID-19 [16, 25]. However, maintaining isolation for

127

many months may have even worse consequences than an epidemic wave that runs an

128

acute course, the isolation measures should be thoughtfully planned and executed based

129

on current stage of pandemic [26]. As observed in table 1 the mean score for SDI was

130

43.126 with a discrete standard deviation when compared with the standard deviation of

131

the daily new cases. A weak correlation was found between the isolation measure with

132

epidemiological data from COVID-19, this may represent that in Brazil social isolation

133

measures are poorly associated with the course of the disease in the country. In addition,

134

these findings may be correlated with failure to control the increase in cases that were

135

added daily, on average, by 3312.26 new cases, during the period covered by this

136

investigation. The absence of concise social distancing policies and, furthermore, the

137

political instability at the center of the Brazilian government poses a deadly distraction in

138

the middle of a public health emergency [1].

139

The weak correlation between social distancing and the course of the disease can

140

also be observed in the time series pattern seen in figure 1 (section A), where while the

141

number of cases per day and cumulative deaths show an ascending pattern, the social

142

distancing index remains with slight changes, with the exception of a slight increase at

143

the end of March, when cases start to show an ascending profile. At the end of the time

144

series, when the daily new cases are at peak, SDI was under de mean observed in the

145

evaluated period.

146

A correlation was found between search engines RSV and SDI (table 2). To further

147

investigate this correlation a multiple linear regression was performed, data extracted

148

from this analysis showed that Google RSV and YouTube RSV are predictors to social

149

distancing. In figure 1 (section B) it is possible to observe de matching behavior of this

150

measures along the time series, with a similar pattern of peaks and decrease starting at the

151

end of April.

152

The positive correlation found with Google RSV may be associated with the access

153

to information, since raising awareness on the severity of the situation and the importance

154

on following the advice from health organizations is a key point on achieving self-

155

isolation intention [20].

156

The negative association observed between YouTube RSV and SDI through de

157

multiple linear regression may correlate with the low quality of YouTube content on

158

COVID-19 reported in previous studies [27-29], since misinformation can hinder the

159

communication of health professionals and organizations with general public and even

160

reduce compliance with treatments or medical advices [30, 31].

161

The findings of the present study support the evidence that online-available

162

information can potentially assist conventional epidemiologic tools for estimating data

163

about patterns of disease and population behavior [5, 6]. Relative search volume of

164

Google and YouTube could define the proper timing and location for practicing

165

appropriate risk communication strategies. Health authorities might apply these data to

166

measure the effect of the transmission of information on the population and to obtain

167

feedback from research statistics.
