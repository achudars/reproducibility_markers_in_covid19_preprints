Abstract
In this work we present an analysis of non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented
around the world in the fight against COVID-19: Social distancing, shelter-in-place,
mask wearing, etc measures to protect the susceptible, together with, in various degrees,
testing & contact-tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected. The majority of
countries have relied on the former, while ramping up their testing and tracing
capabilities. We consider the examples of South Korea, Italy, Canada and the United
States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we show that
in each of the four countries their combination of social-distancing and testing/tracing
to date have had a significant impact on the evolution of their pandemic curves. In this
work we estimate the average isolation rates of infected individuals needing to occur in
each country as a result of large-scale testing and contact tracing as a mean of lifting
social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that an average
isolation rate of an infected individual every 4.5 days (South Korea), 5.7 days (Canada)
and to 6 days (Italy) would be sufficient. We also find that a rate of under 3.5 days will
help in the United States, although it would not completely mitigate the second wave
the country is currently under.

Introduction

1

In late 2019, a novel betacoronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 emerged from a live animal

2

marketplace in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has since inflicted a worldwide

3

pandemic of a disease now referred to as COVID-19. The disease is highly contagious,

4

with an estimated R0 between 2.2 and 4.6 [1, 2] although it is important to consider that

5

R0 is not strictly biologically determined but rather heavily influenced by host

6

behavioural and environmental factors [3]. The incubation period has been found to be

7

5.1-5.2 days, while 97.5% of patients display symptoms within 11.5 days [1, 4]. The

8

disease spreads primarily through the respiratory tract and respiratory secretions.

9

As of July 16 2020, there have been a total of 13.7 million confirmed cases of

July 26, 2020

10

COVID-19 worldwide, and over 580,000 deaths (WHO COVID-19 Situation Report 89,

11

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/

12

situation-reports). All outbreaks, apart from that of Hubei Province continue to be

13

active, with new cases reported daily, though a number of countries have clearly passed

14

a (first) peak. Countries have taken various degrees of social distancing measures:

15

lockdowns, shelter-in-place, banning gatherings, sport events, closing schools, mask

16

wearing etc. (e.g. [5–8]) in an effort to suppress the disease, or at least prevent it from

17

overwhelming a country’s critical care capacity. While proven effective to slow the

18

spread, these measures have had a large effect on daily lives and economies throughout

19

the world. Countries who managed to stave off their first wave, are now in the process

20

of implementing (in various degrees) relaxation measures, in an effort to restore, as

21

much and as safe as possible, their socio-economic landscapes. It is thus critical to

22

further examine and devise strategies which will allow more phasing out of social

distancing measures while preventing a resurgence of outbreaks [9], [10].

24

In this work, we fit a disease transmission model to daily case reports in four

25

developed countries in order to assess the effectiveness of their COVID-19

26

countermeasures. We chose these due to the fact that they implemented

27

countermeasures in various degrees and combinations, with differing outcomes to date.

28

We begin with the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States, three countries

29

which have relied principally on social distancing via universal shelter-in-place measures,

30

while testing and contact tracing was implemented at an increased pace only after the

31

pandemic was more-or-less established in their populations. We compare their pandemic

32

evolution scenarios to that of South Korea, a country which has had and still has a tight

33

control on COVID-19 through a combination of early aggressive testing and contact

34

tracing, paired with social-distancing measures. We show that an analogous strategy

35

can still provide, from this moment onward, a feasible path to further relaxing

36

social-distancing in Italy, Canada and by extension other countries with similar

37

pandemic profiles. The case of the United States stands apart: while coordinated large

38

scale, frequent testing and contact tracing will help decelerate the current U.S.

39

pandemic trajectory, this must be accompanied by a tightening rather than relaxation

40

of social distancing measures if that country’s outbreak is to be brought under control.

41

The structure of the paper is as follows: in Section 2 we introduce our model main

July 26, 2020

42

ideas, notation, and assumptions. We follow in Section 3 with the presentation of our

43

fitted infection curves for Italy, Canada, the U.S., and South Korea, wherein we infer

44

the net effect to date of social distancing, testing & contact tracing on the decrease of

45

the transmission rates in each of the 4 countries. We then evaluate scenarios for

46

countries to phase out social distancing while preventing a resurgence of COVID-19

47

outbreaks by assuming an increase in testing and contact tracing. We are able to derive

48

the frequency with which a tested (infected) individual and an exposed (traced)

49

individual need to be detected and isolated in order for each country to maintain an

50

effective reproduction number of 1 (that is to say, each country maintains a ”slow burn”

51

of their pandemic) while assuming a major relaxation of social-distancing rules. We

52

present a thorough discussion and conclusions in Section 5. Additional mathematical

53

background is included in Appendix A.

Materials and methods

2.1

55

The SEIRL model

56

The transmission of an infectious disease in a homogeneously mixed population is often

57

described by a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model [11] or its variants, most

58

notably a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR); see [12] for a recent review.

59

A SEIR model normalized to population size N is described by 4 differential equations

60

of the form:

61

ds
dt
de

di
dt
dr
dt
with s =

r=

= −βsi

(1)

= βsi − σe
= σe − γi
= γi

s + e + i + r = 1 and where β is the rate of effective

contacts, 1/σ = Tlat is the mean latent period (which may differ from the incubation
period), and 1/γ = Tinf is the mean duration of infectiousness, with both times having
exponential distributions. We also have the auxiliary equation for the cumulative
number of cases,
dc
= σe
dt
The daily incidence of cases on day i is then

62

inci = ci − ci−1

In turn, a SIR model is similar to (1) but without the E compartment, thus only 3

differential equations subject to s + i + r = 1.

64

The spread of an infectious disease can be halted if its effective reproduction number

can be decreased below 1. The effective reproduction number of both the SIR and SEIR

compartmental disease transmission models is

γ

67

(3)

In both the SIR and SEIR model, when s ≈ 1 and we are near the disease-free

68

equilibrium (1, 0, 0, 0), the early growth of both i and inc is exponential (see e.g. [12]):

i(t) = i0 eρt , inc(t) = inc0 eρt

(4)

In the SIR model, the growth factor ρ is given by

ρSIR = β − γ = γ(R0 − 1),

70

(5)

One then can express R0 in terms of ρ:

R0SIR =

71

ρSIR + γ
γ

(6)

In a similar manner, in the SEIR model we have [12]:

ρSEIR =

−(σ + γ) +

p
(σ − γ)2 + 4σβ
2

72

(7)

and by solving for β from Equation 7 we get:

R0SEIR =

(ρSEIR + σ)(ρSEIR + γ)
.
σγ

73

(8)

In the limit as σ → ∞, the SEIR model reduces to the SIR model, and accordingly, as

74

can readily be shown by L’Hospital’s rule:

75

lim =

σ→∞

(ρSEIR + σ)(ρSEIR + γ)
ρSIR + γ
=
σγ
γ

(9)

For COVID-19, as for other pandemics (e.g. SARS, MERS, the 1918 Spanish flu),

July 26, 2020

69

76

we can assume the entire population to be initially susceptible. Therefore, in the early

77

stages of an outbreak, Ref f ≈ R0 . We will also assume that infection with COVID-19

78

confers subsequent immunity, which does not wane significantly over the time horizon

considered here. Thus, whether they die or recover, an infected person is considered

80

removed from the pool of susceptibles. In the absence of a vaccine or other control

81

measures, s(t) = 1 − c(t), where c(t) is the cumulative number of people infected at

82

time t.

83

From Equation 3, assuming β to be given, we see that Ref f can be decreased in two

84

ways: by decreasing s at a rate higher than that due to infection alone; or by increasing

85

γ. The former can be considered an abstraction of social distancing measures, since

86

these effectively take a part of the population “out of circulation” as far as disease

87

transmission is concerned. The latter can be achieved by identifying and isolating

88

infected individuals early, thus cutting short Tinf .

89

To explicitly depict the role of control measures, we adapt the SEIR model to a
pandemic setting by adding an isoLated (L) compartment. As before, we include the

91

auxiliary equation for C, the cumulative number of infected. The resulting SEIRL

92

model, is described by:

= −βsi
= βsi − σe − κ1 e
= σe − (γ + κ)i

= σe

where as in the standard SEIR model, β is the mean rate of effective contacts,

94

1/σ = Tlat is the mean latent period, and 1/γ = Tinf is the mean infectious period.

95

Finally, 1/κ1 = Tisol,lat and 1/κ = Tisol,inf are the mean times for the latent and

96

infectious, respectively, to be isolated as a consequence of either testing or contact

97

tracing.

Its effective reproduction number is then given by (see Appendix A - CHECK)

It can be shown (see Appendix A) that the exponential growth rate (Equation 4) of

100

infected near the disease-free equilibrium is

104

Estimating R0 from early exponential growth

105

While growth is still exponential, we have from (Equation 4) that

106

log(inc(t)) ∝ ρt

(11)

i.e. a log-linear plot of incidence versus time will have slope ρ. Indeed, early exponential

107

growth can be seen to be a near-universal feature in COVID-19 daily case count data

108

from around the world. Figures 1 and 2 plot log(inc) versus time for South Korea, Italy,

109

Canada and the U.S., using time series data of daily new cases compiled by the Johns

113

In all four countries the initial linear phase is clearly apparent, followed by a
transition to sub-exponential growth. This transition is sharpest for South Korea, where

115

growth switches abruptly to decay around 1 March. Regression fit results for ρ and the

in Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1. In all four cases, the transition to sub-exponential

119

growth occurred at or after the time that widespread protective measures were first

120

invoked.

121

Inferring R0 from ρ requires choosing values for the mean latent and infectious

122

periods. The sum of these is the mean serial interval:

Tser = Tlat + Tinf = σ −1 + γ −1

July 26, 2020

123

(13)

Estimates of the serial interval of COVID-19 range from 3.95 to 6.6 days [14–17]. We

124

adopt a value of Tser = 5 days. The latent period of the disease is not well constrained,

125

but it can be shown (Appendix A) that for a given value of Tser and ρ, the maximum

126

value of R0 is obtained when Tlat = Tinf = Tser /2. We assume this “worst-case”

127

scenario and let Tlat = Tinf = 2.5 days.

various combinations. South Korea was the first to impose measures, followed by Italy,

133

where the measures were ordered and coordinated eventually country-wide. In Canada

134

most provinces enacted similar measures over the course of 1-2 weeks around March 20,

135

2020, while the United States has had the more heterogeneous spread of similar

136

measures, depending on specific states.

137

We interpret the transition to sub-exponential growth (Figs 1 and 2) as the first

138

signature of the effect of these measures in a given country, and use this as the starting

139

point to infer the net effect that these measures have had up to the end of June 2020.

140

For each country, we fit the SEIR model solutions for daily incidence

141

{incmodel,1 , ..., incmodel,n } to daily case reports. The model output is multiplied by a

142

factor kf , where k is an estimate of the fraction of symptomatic cases reported,

143

obtained using delay-adjusted case fatality rates [22], and f is the fraction of cases

144

which are symptomatic, estimated to be f = 0.5, from a recent CDC report 1 .

145

We compute − log L, the normal negative log likelihood of the time series of

146

observed daily incidences, {incobs,1 , ..., incobs,n }, given the model output, as a function

147

of model parameters

148

x = (i0 , q1 , q2 , ..., qm )
where i0 is the initial number of infected and the qi are reduction factors on the rate of

149

disease transmission, varying over time, such that βi0 = qi β (see Table 1). R0 for each

150

country is fixed at the respective values obtained via regression above. Parameters are

the one which minimizes L.

Large-scale frequent testing and contact tracing

as a way to relax social-distancing measures and

186

control the spread - the SEIRL model

187

Theoretical estimates

188

As presented in Section 2, for a given set of values of β, σ and γ, Equation 10 gives us a

189

closed form expression for Ref f,SEIRL as a function of κ and κ1 . This relationship is

190

and σ = γ = 15 . In the latter case,

191

depicted as a surface plot in Fig 7 for σ = γ =

1
2.5

Ref f,SEIRL is nearly twice as large as in the former. It is interesting to note, though,

192

that for both cases, the combinations of κ and κ1 that make Ref f,SEIRL = 1 (i.e. the

193

intersections of the respective surfaces with the R0 = 1 plane) are quite similar. This

194

can be understood as follows: As σ and γ become small compared to κ1 and κ,

195

respectively, it is the latter which increasingly dominate the rate at which

196

exposed/infected people are isolated.

compute average isolation rates due to testing and tracing that would ensure an

201

effective reproduction number of 1, while assuming that the effective contact rates β

202

will reverse to their values near the disease-free equilibrium, before any other social

203

distancing measures were employed. We further assume that the isolation rate due to

204

contact tracing ( κ1 ) is the same as the isolation rate due to testing (κ) and we used

205

Equation 14. We present our results compactly in Table 2 below.

209

our estimates for the 2 countries and compute the isolation rates due to testing and

Numerical results

212

We present next pandemic forecasts under different testing and contact tracing rates, in

213

the four countries under consideration. We show how the theoretical estimates arise in

214

the context of the simulated pandemic evolution in each of the 4 countries.

215

We depict first Canada and Italy, as they have with similar estimates, in several
respective testing and contact tracing scenarios:

testing, or testing plus contact-tracing, accompanied by a cessation of distancing

In Fig 9 below, We clearly see that for values of κ−1 = κ−1
1 shorter than the

218

thresholds given in Table 2, a second pandemic wave is averted in each respective

219

country. This threshold is the least stringent in Italy, where about 6% of the population

220

(accounting for asymptomatic and/or unreported cases) is inferred to have been infected

221

in the first wave, as opposed to Canada.

222

Next we present the simulations for South Korea and the United States: We see

223

that the isolation rates are the most stringent (lowest values in days) for the U.S., where

224

the value of R0 inferred from the initial exponential rise of cases is right now higher

225

than that of the other three countries (≈ 1.2). In the case of the United States, a

226

large-scale testing and tracing operation alone will not be able to curtail the current

227

epidemic curve around, thus strong social-distancing measures will be still be needed.

228

Current testing guidelines for social-distancing relaxation measures are established

229

by the WHO in such a way that countries can relax these if positivity rates for testing

230

are under 5% for 14 days in a row. Currently, South Korea is at 1.08%, Italy = 2.39%,

231

Canada = 4.34% and U.S. = 6.28%

Discussion

In keeping with other published findings for these and other countries, our results

241

suggest that the COVID-19 countermeasures taken in South Korea, Italy, Canada and

242

the United States have had a substantial impact on the course of the disease. Even

243

accounting for estimated under-reporting, the number of cases in these countries

244

appears thus far to have been suppressed by roughly one order of magnitude in Italy

245

and the U.S., two orders of magnitude in Canada, and three orders of magnitude in

246

South Korea. The development of effective vaccines and treatments is still critical to the

247

future control of this disease, however in the interim, non-pharmaceutical interventions

248

are the only recourse and can be effective.

249

Modeling studies and the United States case show that, barring a proportion of

asymptomatic cases so large that the majority of people have already been infected, a

251

second wave of disease is inevitable if distancing measures are halted or relaxed early.

252

As shown in the case of the US, it is vital not to rush into a relaxing of distancing

253

measures. As illustrated in Figures 9 to 10, if a change in control strategy causes Ref f

254

to exceed 1, how quickly a second wave builds depends on the number of cases at the

255

time the change has occurred. South Korea has a small number of cases, so (slightly)

256

exceeding Ref f = 1 would result in a gradual climb of cases.

257

In this work, we have attempted to quantify the level of testing which would be

258

needed to allow a country to make a near-complete return to a normal functioning of its

259

society. Among the countries considered here, we estimate that a frequency of isolating

260

individuals based on testing combined with contact-tracing raging from once every 6.2

261

days (Italy) to once every 3.5 days (U.S.) would work to keep the pandemic under a

262

“slow-burn” control. These estimates assume a test with sensitivity at or near 100% and

263

immediate isolation once a subject tests positive. Though reaching these targets would

264

necessitate an undeniably large logistic effort, home-test kits availability4 combined

265

with further advances in mobile device-based contact tracing

5

can make these strategies

267

Our work is subject to a number of limitations. We are simulating large,

268

heterogeneous, geographically widely-distributed populations with an unstratified

269

disease transmission model. Although we have taken the proportion of asymptomatic

270

COVID-19 cases to be 50%, informed by a recent CDC report, assuming asymptomatic

271

infection confers immunity, this would mean a smaller remaining pool of susceptibles

272

and thus a lower current effective reproduction number. Estimates of R0 from time

273

series data of cases depend, as always, on the assumed latent and infectious periods. As

274

we have demonstrated through (Fig 7), if these periods are longer than the isolation

275

time, then it is the latter which principally drives the disease dynamics. Thus, our

276

findings about threshold isolation times are relatively robust against the possibility of a

277

substantially longer COVID-19 serial interval.

Conclusion

Testing and tracing policy directions must be strongly dependant on public cooperation

280

and compliance. Populations will become anxious to resume more normal work, school

281

and social schedules, while compliance with measures will become harder to enforce.

The population must be relied on to comply with self-isolation if testing positive for the

virus, as well as self-isolation upon being exposed to an infected person. Last,

sustainable supply chains, accuracy and reliability of possible tests as well as privacy

285

issues around electronic contact tracing technology all present important, though not

vaccines and treatments, the testing and tracing policies together with NPI measures are

288

much more desirable and should be the one to strive for in the immediate short-term.

Local exponential growth around a disease free

equilibrium with s(0) ≤ 1 in an SEIRL model

352

We want to find a relation between the exponential growth of the infected compartment

353

in an SEIRL model (10) and the reproductive number R0 around a disease-free

354

equilibrium of the type (s(0) = s̃ ≤ 1, 0, 0, 0) which arises as a possibility in a first wave

355

(s̃ = 1) or a second wave of a pandemic such as COVID-19 (s̃ < 1).

356

In this case, we conduct a similar computation as in [12], but considering the 4
dimensional system of equations for s, e, i, l leads us to the Jacobian of the SEIRL:

Again we note that the linearized equations for s and l are decoupled from the equations

Its characteristic equation is:

positive. This implies that ρ1 6= ρ2 ∈ R and clearly ρ2 < 0. We check whether ρ1 > 0 by

Inequality (16) simply shows that in order to not have an exponential growth from

We note that β and γ are disease-dependent values on which we cannot exert control.

374

However, κ and κ1 are parameters on which we can exert an exogenous control

(specifically to increase them, thus raising the upper bound on fractions s̃ with no

376

Continuing as in [12], we express β as a function of s̃, σ, γ, κ, κ1 from (15) and we
get:

Following [23], we can use the next generation matrix to deduce R0 as the dominant
eigenvalue of the next generation matrix:

Now using the expression of β in that of R0 we are able to express the effective
reproductive number as a function of the exponential growth and of γ, σ, κ, κ1 :

R0 =

R0 =

(σ + κ1 + ρ1 )(γ + κ + ρ1 )
and Ref f = s(t)R0 , ∀t > 0
(σ + κ1 )(γ + κ)

Similar to (8) we denote by R0S(Q)EIRL :

R0SEIRL =

388

(σ + κ1 + ρ1 )(γ + κ + ρ1 )
(γ + κ)σ

Clearly, if κ = κ1 = 0 then R0SEIRL reduces to R0SEIR in (8) of Section 2.

389

Let us now note that we have shown that the exponential growth factor (15), as well
as the R0SEIRL , are dependent on the rates κ and κ1 , that is to say, we denote by

ρ(κ, κ1 ) =

−(σ + κ1 + γ + κ) +

Let us express the reproductive number, in general, as a function of Tlat =
