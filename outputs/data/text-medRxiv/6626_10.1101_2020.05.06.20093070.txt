ABSTRACT
Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are regularly complicated by respiratory
failure. While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with
worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the
thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of
neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9
(calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and
respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n=172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin
in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive
protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in
identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as
oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=94 patients),
calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19
requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n=32) as compared to those who remained
free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, p<0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely
with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of
inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to hundreds of countries
and territories and has been declared a global pandemic. Severe COVID-19 results in death
due to progressive hypoxemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ
failure [1]. The role of the host response in this progression remains to be fully defined.

S100A8 (myeloid-related protein 8/MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) are calcium-binding proteins
that belong to the S100 family. They exist mainly together as a biologically-functional
heterodimer known as S100A8/A9 or calprotectin. Calprotectin is found in abundance in
neutrophils, where it can account for almost two-thirds of soluble protein in the cytosol.
Calprotectin may also be detected at low levels in monocytes, macrophages, platelets, and
squamous epithelial cells [2]. Upon neutrophil activation or death, calprotectin is released
extracellularly where it has microbicidal functions (via heavy-metal chelation) and also serves as
a pro-inflammatory ligand for innate receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation
endproducts (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [3]. Given its small size, easy diffusion
between tissue and blood, and resistance to enzymatic degradation, calprotectin is a sensitive
and dynamic marker of neutrophil activation anywhere in the body [4, 5]. High levels of
calprotectin have been found in many types of infectious and inflammatory diseases—including
sepsis, myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, and adult-onset Still’s
disease—where it tracks closely with disease severity [6-10].

While work to date exploring COVID-19 pathophysiology has focused especially on
macrophages and their products such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β, it has also been
observed that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in
COVID-19 [11-13]. Furthermore, our group and others have also revealed a potentially
pathogenic role for neutrophil-derived extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 [14, 15]. There
remains though a paucity of information about neutrophil catalysts, checkpoints, and effector
mechanisms in COVID-19—all of which could add actionable context to our understanding of
the COVID-19 thrombo-inflammatory storm. Here, to better understand the potential role of
neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured calprotectin in the blood of patients hospitalized with
COVID-19 and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Serum samples were obtained from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a large
academic hospital (Supplemental Table 1). In some cases, sera were stored at 4°C in the
clinical laboratory for up to 48 hours before being frozen. Interestingly, we found that
calprotectin levels are stable in both serum and plasma for up to six days at 4°C (Supplemental
Figure 1), which is in line with past research on the topic [16]. As compared with serum
samples from 47 healthy controls, the COVID-19 samples showed markedly higher levels of
calprotectin (Figure 1A). For 36 patients, longitudinal sera were available. Nine of those
patients showed a clinically meaningful change in oxygenation status during the period of
collection (six worsening and three improving). Notably, calprotectin levels trended upward in
the six patients for whom oxygenation worsened (Figure 1B). We next asked how calprotectin
compared to commonly available clinical measurements. Specifically, we assessed potential
correlations with C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, absolute neutrophil count,
absolute lymphocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. Calprotectin demonstrated a
positive correlation with C-reactive protein (Figure 1C), ferritin (r=0.31, p=0.0002), lactate
dehydrogenase (r=0.52, p<0.0001), absolute neutrophil count (Figure 1D), and platelet count
(r=0.39, p<0.0001). There was no correlation with absolute lymphocyte count (Figure 1E), and
a negative correlation with hemoglobin level (r=-0.34, p<0.0001). In summary, calprotectin is
markedly elevated in the sera of patients with COVID-19 and may rise as clinical status
deteriorates.
We next determined each patient’s clinical respiratory status at the time calprotectin was
measured. As compared with patients breathing room air, patients requiring mechanical
ventilation had significantly higher levels of calprotectin (Figure 2A). Interestingly, differences
were also appreciated between patients requiring noninvasive oxygen support (such as nasalcannula oxygen) and mechanical ventilation (Figure 2A). In contrast, C-reactive protein did not
discriminate between patients requiring noninvasive oxygen support and those requiring
mechanical ventilation (Figure 2B). To further evaluate the potential clinical utility of
calprotectin, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis based on
requirement for mechanical ventilation. As compared with C-reactive protein, ferritin, and lactate
dehydrogenase, calprotectin had a superior area under the curve (Figure 2C). Beyond clinical
respiratory status, oxygenation efficiency can also be measured by comparing pulse oximetry
(SpO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). We tested the correlation between calprotectin
and SpO2/FiO2 ratio, and found a striking negative association (Figure 2D). A less robust

association was also appreciated for C-reactive protein (Figure 2E). In summary, calprotectin
levels strongly associate with severe respiratory disease requiring mechanical ventilation.

To confirm these findings, we also obtained plasma from 119 of the 172 patients. As compared
with plasma samples from 50 healthy controls, the COVID-19 samples showed markedly higher
levels of calprotectin (Supplemental Figure 2A). Furthermore, for the COVID-19 patients,
plasma calprotectin demonstrated a distinct negative correlation with SpO2/FiO2 ratio
(Supplemental Figure 2B), and positive correlations with C-reactive protein (Supplemental
Figure 2C) and absolute neutrophil count (Supplemental Figure 2D). We also found positive
correlations between calprotectin and markers of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release
including cell-free DNA (Supplemental Figure 2E) and myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes
(Supplemental Figure 2F).

Finally, of the 172 patients with serum samples evaluated here, 94 had sera available from the
first two days of their hospitalization. When some of the aforementioned correlation analyses
were reanalyzed with just these 94 samples (Supplemental Figure 3), we found a strong
negative correlation with SpO2/FiO2, and strong positive correlations with C-reactive protein and
absolute neutrophil count. Most importantly, calprotectin levels were significantly higher in those
individuals who required mechanical ventilation at any point during their hospitalization (n=32),
as compared with those who did not (p<0.0001, Figure 2F). C-reactive protein was also
analyzed (when available on the same day as the calprotectin measurement) and was found to
be predictive of any mechanical ventilation with a p-value of 0.0054 (Figure 2G). Taken
together, these data suggest a compelling relationship between neutrophil activation, as defined
by serum calprotectin levels, and severe respiratory disease in COVID-19.

In summary, we report markedly elevated levels of serum and plasma calprotectin in the
majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Furthermore, we found that high levels of
serum calprotectin on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization tracked with a requirement for mechanical
ventilation at any point during the admission, a finding that should be assessed in larger
prospective cohorts. These data provide strong evidence in support of neutrophils as potential
players in moderate-to-severe cases of COVID-19.

Our study raises the need to investigate the specific form of neutrophil activation and/or cell
death that floods COVID-19 blood with excess calprotectin. Tissue damage and neutrophil

necrosis are potential sources of passive calprotectin release [17]. At the same, active
calprotectin secretion has been documented upon stimulation of neutrophils with complement
C5 and fMLP [18]. Engagement of neutrophil PSGL-1 by E-selectin can also trigger neutrophils
to actively release calprotectin in calcium ion-dependent fashion (TLR4 and its downstream
MyD88 and Rap1-GTP trigger release via this same mechanism) [19]. A newer consideration
regarding active calprotectin release is NETosis [14, 20]. NETs are extracellular webs of DNA,
histones, and microbicidal proteins that appear to perpetuate many types of lung disease
including smoking-related disease, cystic fibrosis, and ARDS. NETs leverage calprotectin as an
antimicrobial strategy against Candida [21] and Aspergillus [22], but, when left unchecked,
NETs are also an important source of macrophage activation and microvascular occlusion.
Whether passive calprotectin release in necrotic lung tissue or active release via NETosis (or
another mechanism) is most important to COVID-19 pathophysiology awaits further research.

In addition to being an inflammatory marker, calprotectin may also have a direct role in the selfamplifying thrombo-inflammatory storm of COVID-19 via engagement and activation of innate
immune sensors such as RAGE [23, 24] and TLR4 [25, 26]. Depending on the system,
calprotectin has also been detected both upstream [27] and downstream [28] of IL-6, which has
emerged as a possible therapeutic target in COVID-19. As a key alarmin molecule of the
immune system, calprotectin modulates the inflammatory response by recruiting leukocytes and
stimulating cytokine secretion [29]. Calprotectin also induces reactive nitrogen and oxygen
species [30, 31] and triggers microvascular endothelial cells to take on thrombogenic and proinflammatory phenotypes characterized by increased vascular permeability and synthesis of
cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules [29]. Furthermore, calprotectin is a potent
stimulator of neutrophils themselves, promoting degranulation and phagocytosis [32, 33], as
well as NETosis [34]. Intriguingly, crosstalk between neutrophils, platelets, and calprotectin
appears to play a role in both arterial and venous thrombosis [34, 35], which are being
increasingly identified as complications of COVID-19 [36, 37].

As we await definitive antiviral and immunologic solutions to the current pandemic, we posit that
anti-neutrophil therapies [38-40] may be part of a personalized strategy for some individuals
affected by COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to respiratory failure. In this context,
calprotectin is well-positioned to be an early indicator of patients with COVID-19 likely to
progress to respiratory failure and who therefore require immunomodulatory treatment.

EXTENDED METHODS
Human samples. Serum and plasma samples from 172 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were
used in this study. Blood was collected into serum separator tubes or EDTA tubes by a trained
hospital phlebotomist. After completion of biochemical and hematological testing ordered by the
clinician, the remaining serum and plasma was stored at 4°C for up to 48 hours before it was
released to the research laboratory. Serum and plasma samples were immediately divided into
small aliquots and stored at -80°C until the time of testing. All 172 patients had a confirmed
COVID-19 diagnosis based on FDA-approved RNA testing. This study complied with all relevant
ethical regulations, and was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board
(HUM00179409), which waived the requirement for informed consent given the discarded
nature of the samples. Healthy volunteers were recruited through a posted flyer; exclusion
criteria for these controls included history of a systemic autoimmune disease, active infection,
and pregnancy. For serum analysis, 47 controls were used (36 females and 11 males with
mean age of 38.8 ± 11.3). For plasma analysis, 50 controls were used (37 females and 13
males with mean age of 41.5 ± 13.4).
Quantification of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin). Calprotectin levels were measured with the
Human S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer DuoSet ELISA (DY8226-05, R&D Systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification of cell-free DNA. Cell-free DNA was quantified in sera using the Quant-iT
PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, P11496) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantification of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes. Myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes were
quantified similarly to what has been previously described. This protocol used several reagents
from the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche). First, a high-binding EIA/RIA 96-well plate
(Costar) was coated overnight at 4ºC with anti-human myeloperoxidase antibody (Bio-Rad
0400-0002), diluted to a concentration of 1 µg/ml in coating buffer (Cell Death kit). The plate
was washed two times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), and then blocked with 4%
bovine serum albumin in PBS (supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 hours at room
temperature. The plate was again washed five times, before incubating for 90 minutes at room
temperature with 10% serum or plasma in the aforementioned blocking buffer (without Tween
20). The plate was washed five times, and then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature
with 10x anti-DNA antibody (HRP-conjugated; from the Cell Death kit) diluted 1:100 in blocking

buffer. After five more washes, the plate was developed with 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate (Invitrogen) followed by a 2N sulfuric acid stop solution. Absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader
(BioTek). Data were normalized to in vitro-prepared NET standards included on every plate,
which were quantified based on their total protein content.

Statistical analysis. When two groups were present, normally-distributed data were analyzed
by two-sided t test and skewed data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test. For
three or more groups, analysis was by one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test with correction
for multiple comparisons. Correlations were tested by Spearman’s method. Data analysis was
with GraphPad Prism software version 8. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.
