Abstract:

12

On 23 and 30 March 2020 the Mexican Federal government implemented social distancing measures

13

to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. We use a mathematical model to explore atypical transmission

14

events within the confinement period, triggered by the timing and strength of short time perturbations

15

of social distancing.

16

significant reduction of the effective contact rate in the early weeks of the intervention. However,

17

”flattening the curve” had an undesirable effect, since the epidemic peak was delayed too far, almost

18

to the government preset day for lifting restrictions (01 June 2020). If the peak indeed occurs in late

19

May or early June, then the events of children’s day and mother’s day may either generate a later

20

peak (worst case scenario), a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence (middle case

21

scenario) or the same peak date as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak

22

interval of slower decay.

25

On 23 March 2020, the Mexican Federal government officially established mitigation measures

26

to control the COVID-19 epidemic.

27

non-mandatory social distancing recommendations was issued. One week later, on 30 March 2020,

28

a Sanitary Emergency was declared, ordering the suspension of all non-essential activities in the

29

public and private sectors, until 30 April 2020, a date that was later extended to 01 June 2020.

30

The aim of these measures was to lower the incidence to manageable levels in terms of the expected

31

number of critical cases [1]. On 16 April 2020, the federal government announced that, for Mexico

32

City, the epidemic peak (day of maximum incidence) would occur on 08-10 May 2020 [2,3]. On May

33

8th, this estimate was corrected and moved to no later than 20 May 2020 [4, 5]. A gradual lifting

34

of social-distancing measures was announced to start on 01 June 2020. Unfortunately, government

35

predictions seem to be underestimating the time of maximum incidence, since the epidemic curve

36

has not shown clear signs of having reached the peak by mid-May. If conditions remain constant

We show that social distancing measures were successful in achieving a

37

with respect to the population compliance of the mitigation measures, then the peak could occur

38

by late May or early June [6, 7], coinciding with the date set for the lifting of social-distancing.

39

However, things may be more complicated than this. There are two holidays, children’s day and

40

mother’s day, where mobility increases; these events may have an important impact on the epidemic

41

curve and thus on the strategy to implement the lifting of social-distancing, not considered in the

42

early forecasts.

43

In this paper, we explore the possible impact of such short time periods where the population

44

does not follow the social distancing measures, and use Mexico City as an example to show the

45

consequences of different scenarios. First, in Section 2 we explain the methods and data used for

46

the analysis. Then, in Section 3, we describe the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in

47

Mexico City, including an evaluation of the mitigation measures using the Richards model. Then,

48

using a Kermack-McKendrick model [6], we generate scenarios that describe the impact of the two

49

aforementioned holidays on the shape of the epidemic curve for Mexico City. Finally, the discussion

50

and conclusions are presented in Section 4.

53

Data for the COVID-19 epidemic was provided by the Secretarı́a de Ciencia, Tecnologı́a e Innovación

54

of the Government of Mexico City through the COVID-19-CDMX database [8]. This data set

55

contains details on all the confirmed and suspected COVID-19 individuals such as sex, age, residence

56

region, date of symptoms onset, etc. Records are available from 22 February 2020 to 19 May 2020.

57

Due to reporting delays and delays imposed by the incubation period of the virus, we do not use

58

the last 14 days of data in all of our estimations.

2.2

Richards model

We fit the Richards model to the epidemic curve [9] to estimate the growth rate for two different
periods, 22 February 2020 to 22 March 2020, and 23 March 2020 to 27 April 2020, to have an
approximation of the reduction in the growth rate r resulting from the social distancing measures
implemented by the federal government. We assume that the cumulative cases curve of COVID-19,
C(t), can be described by the solution of


a 
C(t)
C 0 (t) = rC(t) 1 −
,
K

(1)

60

where r is the infection growth rate, K is the final epidemic size, and a is a scaling parameter to

61

account for the asymmetry of the epidemic curve. This model is an extension of the simple logistic

62

growth model that has already been used to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in China [9].

63

The parameters a, r, and K must be estimated from the observed data. We use a statistical

64

approach through Bayesian inference [10, 11]. Technical details of the estimation process can be

65

found in Appendix A.

66

2.3

67

To evaluate the impact of atypical events, we use the model developed in [6] under the scenario

68

that 70% of the general population is confined and 30% is not. This split of the population occurs

69

when social distancing measures are implemented on 23 March 2020. The non-confined population

70

includes workers with essential economic activities in government and industry, or individuals

71

that work in the informal economy. In Mexico City, the informal economy represents 49% of

72

the economically active population [12]. Once under confinement, this population abandons the

73

confinement at a rate ω that we call the confinement-failure rate. This is the parameter we use as

74

a proxy for population mobility. For more details on the mathematical model, we refer the reader

75

to [6]. Figure 1 shows the model diagram.

Mathematical model setup

76

Since individuals under confinement fail to comply with the social-distancing indicatives at a

77

rate ω (baseline ω0 = 0.005/day), they become part of the other subpopulation. The model assumes

78

that, in both groups, the effective contact rate is actually reduced, but the subpopulation under

79

confinement has the largest reduction of the two.

80

In the next section, we model the atypical increase in mobility on children’s and mother’s days

81

as follows: i) in each case, we assume the increased mobility lasts only for a period of τ days, and

82

ii) the increased mobility on these dates is reflected on an increase of the compliance-failure rate

83

ω0 by a factor k. For these dates, the new compliance-failure rate is kω0 .

84

85

3.1

86

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico can be presented in several forms. Figure 2

87

shows confirmed cumulative cases reported by date of symptoms onset, by the date of arrival at the

88

hospital, and by the date when tests were confirmed. It also shows that the growth pattern in each

89

one is different. For example, if we focus on cases reported by the date of test confirmation (green

90

bars), the cumulative cases show that the epidemic is still in the exponential growth period. On

91

the other hand, for the cases reported by symptoms onset (blue bars), cumulative cases show linear

92

growth. In this work we use this last representation (symptoms onset) since it describes the growth

93

of the epidemic in terms of active cases. Figure 3 shows the number of confirmed and suspected cases

94

by symptoms onset. Suspected cases are those individuals that present COVID-19-like symptoms

95

but are still waiting for test results. As of 19 May 2020, in Mexico City, there are 6973 suspected

96

cases, which amounts to 46% of the 15283 confirmed cases at the same date. Certainly, not all

97

suspected cases will be confirmed as COVID-19 cases. If we consider that the positivity rate in

98

Mexico City is approximately 35%, then 2440 of those 6973 suspects will be confirmed, a fraction

99

that represents 16% of the total confirmed cases. The still increasing tendency of the number of

100

suspected cases shown to date, lends support to the hypothesis that for Mexico City the peak of the

101

epidemic has yet to be reached. This is an important consideration regarding the end of confinement

102

measures and the impact of atypical events on the dynamics of transmission on the shape of the

103

epidemic curve.

104

We have already pointed out that some suspected cases are waiting for test results, but it is

105

equally possible that many of them are yet to be tested. According to the official daily published

106

data, the number of tests has dropped significantly since the first week of May (Figure 4). This

107

does not necessarily mean that there are fewer tests but rather, that there is an important delay in

108

the reporting of results. This possibility is consistent with Figure 3 that shows that the number of

109

suspected cases has indeed increased since the beginning of May. It is possible too that there is a

110

saturation in the laboratories that apply the tests and this could be causing a lag in the reported

111

cases or that tests for the general population are being canalized elsewhere due to the increase

112

in mortality and hospitals’ demand. This also could explain why there are many suspected cases

113

that started symptoms in March and April that have not yet been confirmed. In summary, the

114

most recent observations of the number of confirmed cases are still incomplete. It will take at least

115

two weeks before we have data to conclusively decide whether Mexico City is really close to the

116

maximum incidence peak or not.

117

3.2

118

Table 1 shows the parameter estimates for the two periods. It can be seen that, before the start

119

of social distancing on 23 March 2020, the growth rate is approximately 1.062 with a 95% interval

120

(0.408,3.197). After 23 March 2020, the growth rate is 0.103 with a 95% interval of (0.096, 0.119).

121

This gives us an average reduction of 90% of the epidemic growth rate in the early days of the

122

implementation of social distancing measures. Figure 5 shows the observed daily data and the fit

123

of the model before and after the isolation measures. Richards model also provides information

124

about the maximum cumulative incidence (epidemic size). Our estimations project, at the date

125

of writing, a maximum incidence to occur between 22-May and 15 June, 2020. Given the overall

126

decreasing magnitude of the reproductive number Rt (described below) at the time of writing, we

127

cautiously provide results for K as an illustration of a possible scenario (see Table 1).

Reduction in epidemic growth rate

128

Figure 6 shows the evolution of the instantaneous reproduction number Rt in Mexico City until

129

5 May 2020, four days after mother’s day. It is computed using the algorithm in [13, 14] with a

130

mean intergenerational period of 4.7 days [15]. Note that the Rt trend shows a slight increase

131

just around 30 April and 01 May. Transmission events occurring in these days will be reflected

132

within 14 days, both as increased incidence and mortality. At the date of writing, we still do

133

not have the information to explore this possibility. We can conclude, however, that although

134

the social-distancing measures were indeed effective by reducing transmission as evidenced by the

135

reduction of the epidemic growth rate after 23 March 2020, they also pushed the peak towards the

136

end of the month, at the earliest.

137

3.3

138

In Mexico, social-distancing measures are focused on social-distancing and non-pharmaceutical

139

interventions (NPIs) to reduce contact between individuals. However, in Mexico City, increases in

140

population mobility that last a few days have been observed [16]. This increased mobility weakens

141

the strength of the NPIs and, therefore, may have an impact on disease transmission. This section

142

explores the consequences of bursts of increasing mobility near the peak day of the epidemic curve.

143

As already mentioned before, there are two important holidays (in terms of population mobility)

144

within the period of confinement: 30 April, children’s day, and 10 May, mother’s day. There exists

145

evidence that population mobility slightly increased [16] in these two days. To study the effect,

146

we use the periods A): 29-30 April 2020, which are weekdays and B): 08-10 May 2020, a weekend.

147

For these periods, the confinement-failure rate is kω0 , where k = 2 or 5. The magnitude of k is

148

arbitrary but, relative to ω0 = 0.005/day, it is a small perturbation.

Effect of atypical events on social-distancing measures

149

Our scenarios are:

150

• Scenario I with two cases: I.1) k = 2 in A and B, I.2) k = 5 in A and B.

151

• Scenario II with two cases II.1) k = 2 in A, k = 5 in B; I.2) k = 5 in A, k = 2 in B.

152

Scenario I assumes that both periods have equal ω. This is a baseline case since mother’s day in

153

Mexico is an extremely important family date whose popularity is well beyond that for children’s

154

day. Scenario II addresses this difference. It considers an unequal outflow from social-distancing.

155

We look at the impact of these two events on the epidemic peak, assuming that the peak occurs in

156

early June.

157

Figure 7 shows our simulations for both scenarios. Case I.2 is clearly the worst-case scenario

158

(black dashed line). After the perturbation, the incidence peak is higher and later for several weeks.

159

The epidemic size increases too. Scenario I.1 (black line), on the other hand, is comparatively

160

benign. The peak is still reached on the baseline date, then there is an interval of about a month

161

where the epidemic curve decreases with a lower rate than the baseline case. Afterward, the decrease

162

is essentially at the same speed as that for the original curve (blue). Case II.1 (red dashed line)

163

occurs when the children’s day period (29-30 April) has a lower confinement-failure rate than the

164

mother’s day period (08-10 May). Observe that when the peak is reached, the incidence curve does

165

not show a significant decay but rather, enters into a plateau phase that lasts several weeks after

166

the baseline peak date (blue curve). On the other hand, in scenario II.2 (red line), the largest

167

increase in the confinement-failure rate occurs for fewer days (children’s day period), producing an

168

epidemic curve similar to the one in scenario II.1.

169

Remark: We illustrate the effect of these atypical events with the specific holidays above, but

170

the exercise can be viewed in more general terms. Figure 8 shows the consequences of increased

171

mobility in short periods occurring before or after the incidence peak. In this case, the mobility

172

increases for three days by a factor of k = 10 times the baseline containment failure rate (i.e.,

173

ω = 10ω0 ). The worst case scenario occurs when the atypical event is located on the exponential

174

growth phase of the curve and far from the maximum incidence (black discontinuous line). A less

175

extreme scenario occurs when the increase in population mobility is located after and far from the

176

incidence peak (green discontinuous line). For completeness, in Appendix B, we show simulations

177

for a mobility increase of only five-fold the baseline value. This scenario is, hopefully, the one that

178

will occur in Mexico City, but at the time of writing, the incidence data for the days around 10

179

May 2020 is still incomplete and the mobility impact cannot be yet verified.

We have presented an analysis of the current COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico, illustrating some

183

implemented by the country’s federal health authorities on 23, 30 March 2020 were effective in

184

mitigating the epidemic growth rate in the weeks after this date. This result is supported by our

185

estimate of the reduction of the epidemic growth rate using Richard’s model, and also with the

186

sustained downward trend of the effective reproductive number until 29 April 2020 (right up to

187

children‘s day, on 30 April). The analysis of the precise epidemiological situation in Mexico is

188

difficult because, among other things, the COVID-19 test rate is very low [17]. Moreover, its high

189

positivity rate (in the interval 21% to 40% in Mexico City for the first week of May [8]) indicates

190

a large under-reporting of cases that affects the estimates of true mortality and incidence rates.

191

Our analysis relies on the confirmed cases reported by the General Directorate of Epidemiology.

192

Nevertheless, the available data shows that although the aim of flattening the epidemic curve has

193

been achieved in Mexico City and, on average, in the whole country, the Mexican case shows

194

that mitigation measures cannot be only concerned with spreading the infections over a longer

195

period and reducing the incidence peak. Timing is of utmost importance [18]. For Mexico City, the

196

government originally forecasted the peak to occur by 8-10 May 2020, setting the date for liberation

197

of mitigation measures for 30 May. The peak has not yet been reached by 20 May (when this report

198

is being written), pushing the likely dates for it to occur either close to the end of May or, likely,

199

beyond 01 June 2020, the new revised date set for lifting mobility restrictions and the start of the

200

reactivation of the economy. In this context, events where a high increase in mobility takes place,

201

like what possibly occurred on children’s day and mother’s day (30 April and 10 May, respectively),

202

may impact the epidemic curve before the peak occurs.

203

We have used a mathematical model previously developed [6], to generate plausible scenarios

204

that may affect the epidemic curve, as related to the timing and strength of perturbations of

205

social distancing measures. We have explored the effect of pulses of unusual activity (within the

206

confinement period) on the epidemic curve of COVID-19 in Mexico City. These are necessarily

207

theoretical results, but we believe they illuminate the importance of counting with reasonable

208

estimates for the timing of maximum incidence. We have already mentioned that mitigation

209

measures will be lifted on 01 June 2020 as announced in early April 2020, and that the current

210

epidemic trend strongly indicates that the peak will occur past the middle of May. If it was to

211

occur in late May or early June as predicted by other models [6,7], then the events of children’s day

212

and mother’s day may either generate, depending of the magnitude of ω, a later peak (worst case

213

scenario), a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence (middle case scenario) or the

214

same peak date as in the original baseline epidemic curve but with a post-peak interval of slower

215

decay (Figures 7 and 8).

216

Mathematical models are essential in the fight against COVID-19. They are tools for evaluating

217

mitigation measures, estimating mortality and incidence, and projecting scenarios to help public

218

health decision-makers in their very difficult and important task of controlling the epidemic. In this

219

paper, we have used mathematical models to evaluate and generate scenarios. Although precise

220

forecasting is not our aim, we consider that these results can be helpful for decision-makers.

Parameter estimation of the growth rate

232

Let Yj , for j = 1, 2, ..., n, be the number of observed cumulative cases at time tj , with tj given in

233

days. We assume that Yj follows a Negative Binomial distribution with mean value C(tj |a, r, K)

234

and dispersion parameter α. Here, C(tj |a, r, K) is the solution of Richards model presented in (1).

235

Assuming that, given the parameters, the observations Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yn are conditionally independent,
then

E[Yj |a, r, K, α] = C(tj |a, r, K)
V ar[Yj |a, r, K, α] = C(tj |a, r, K) + αC(tj |a, r, K)2

(2)

236

The Negative Binomial distribution allows to control the variability of the data by considering

237

over-dispersion, which is common for epidemiological data. If α = 0, then we return to the Poisson

238

model which is often used in this context.

239

Let θ = (a, r, K, α) be the vector of parameters to estimate. The inclusion of the parameter

240

α, which is related to the variability of the data, not to the Richards model, is necessary since in

241

practice this variability is unknown. Then, the likelihood function, which represents how likely it

242

is to observe the data under the Negative Binomial assumption and Richards model if we knew the
parameters, is given by

Consider the parameters a, r, K, and α as random variables. Assuming prior independence, the

244

joint prior distribution for vector θ is

π(θ) = π(a)π(r)π(K)π(α),

245

where π(a) is the probability density function (pdf) of a Uniform(0,1) distribution, π(r) is the

246

pdf of a Uniform(0,5), π(K) is the pdf of a Uniform(Kmin , Kmax ), and π(α) is the pdf of a

Gamma(shape=2, scale=0.1). To select the prior for parameter r, we consider that other estimations

248

of r are close to 0.3 [9]. In addition, there is no available prior information regarding the final size

249

of the outbreak K. This is a critical parameter in the model and, to avoid bias, we assume a

250

uniform prior over Kmin and Kmax . To set these last to values, we consider that the minimum

251

number of confirmed cases is the current number of observed cases Y (tn ) times 10 and 5, i.e.,

252

Kmin = yn ∗ 10 and Kmin = yn ∗ 5, for the periods before and after 23 March 2020, respectively. To

253

set the upper bound for K, we consider a fraction of the total population Kmax = N ∗ 0.02, where

254

N is the population size of Mexico City. This fraction was determined base on the observations of

255

other cities such as New York, where the total population size is similar to Mexico City and the

256

proportion of infected represents one of the worst case scenarios up to date.
Then, the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest is

π(θ|y1 , . . . , yn ) ∝ π(y1 , . . . , yn |θ)π(θ),

257

and it does not have an analytical form because the likelihood function depends on the solution of

258

the Richards model, which is non-linear in the parameters. We analyze the posterior distribution

259

using an MCMC algorithm that does not require tuning called t-walk [19]. This algorithm generates

260

samples from the posterior distribution that can be used to estimate marginal posterior densities,

261

mean, variance, quantiles, etc. We refer the reader to [10] for more details on MCMC methods and

262

to [11] for an introduction to Bayesian inference with differential equations.

Figure 9a shows the change in the epidemic curve when mobility increases for a single period lasting

265

three days. We show how the location of this perturbation with respect to the peak date, affects the

266

epidemic curve for a low confinement-failure rate ω. If the perturbation occurs in the exponential

267

growth phase, the total incidence (area under the curve Figure 9b) will be higher than when the

268

event is located further to the left of the peak. When the event occurs in the declining phase of the
