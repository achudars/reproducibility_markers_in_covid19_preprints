Abstract
Over 200,000 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been determined for viruses isolated from
around the world. These sequences have been critical for understanding the spread and evolution of
SARS-CoV-2. Using global phylogenomics, we show that mutations frequently occur in the C-terminal
end of ORF7a. We have isolated one of these mutant viruses from a patient sample and used viral challenge experiments to demonstrate that ∆115 mutation results in a growth defect. ORF7a has been implicated in immune modulation, and we show that the C-terminal truncation results in distinct changes
in interferon stimulated gene expression. Collectively, this work indicates that ORF7a mutations occur
frequently and that these changes affect viral mechanisms responsible for suppressing the immune response.

Introduction
The spillover of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the human population has resulted in a global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) with more than 2.1 million deaths worldwide
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) (Andersen et al., 2020). While
much of the research on this virus is focused on the Spike
protein, recent reports demonstrate that accessory proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 might be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis
by modulating antiviral host responses (Young et al., 2020;
Zhang et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 uses multiple strategies to

evade host immunity. Accessory proteins ORF3b, ORF6 and
ORF7a antagonize various steps of type I interferon (IFN-I)
production and signaling, while ORF8 disrupts antigen presentation by downregulating MHC-I (Konno et al., 2020; Lei
et al., 2020; Miorin et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020; Zhang et
al., 2020). To occlude signal transmission from IFN receptors,
ORF7a subverts phosphorylation of STAT2, suppressing transcriptional activation of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)
that can otherwise restrict viral replication (Martin-Sancho et
al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020). While the proposed function for
ORF7a is intracellular, antibodies against ORF7a are elevated
in the serum of COVID-19 patients (Hachim et al., 2020).
Work that is currently under review indicates that recombinant ORF7a protein interacts with CD14+ monocytes and
triggers expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
(Zhou, Z. et al., 2020). However, it is unclear if these interactions happen in COVID-19 patients. Together, these data
suggest that ORF7a plays a dual role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating both the IFN and inflammatory responses.

SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance identifies naturally occurring truncations of ORF7a that limit immune suppression.
— 2/11

Here, we show that C-terminal mutations in ORF7a occur
frequently in samples isolated from patients around the globe.
These mutations are not derived from a single lineage and
they do not persist over time. Using samples collected from
infected patients, we have isolated a virus containing a deletion mutation in ORF7a that truncates the C-terminal half of
the protein. In vitro viral challenge experiments demonstrate
that this mutation results in a replication defect and obviates
viral suppression of the immune response. Collectively, these
data suggests that ORF7a truncations are defective in suppressing the host immune response, which may explain why
these mutations quickly disappear in the immunocompetent
population.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance identifies truncation of ORF7a accessory protein
Genome sequencing has been used to track the rise and
spread of new SARS-CoV-2 lineages over the course of the
pandemic (https://www.gisaid.org/) (Bedford et al., 2020;
Korber et al., 2020). As part of this effort, we sequenced
SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients in Bozeman,
Montana (Figure 1A, Table S1). In total, we determined
56 whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from patients between April and July of 2020 using
an amplicon-based Nanopore protocol from the ARTIC network (https://artic.network/) (Quick et al., 2017; Tyson et
al., 2020). To place the local outbreak in the context of the
global SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary trends, we aligned 56 whole
genome sequences isolated from patients in Bozeman to 4,235
genomes subsampled (10 genomes per month per country)
from 181,003 SARS-CoV-2 genomes downloaded from the
GISAID. The subsampling protocol removes redundancy and
bias introduced by uneven distribution of the global SARSCoV-2 sequencing effort. The resulting alignment was used to
build a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1B). Of the 56 SARS-CoV-2
genomes determined from patients in Bozeman, only one was
derived from the WA1 lineage (lineage A in Figure 1B) that
was introduced to Washington state from Wuhan, China in
January 2020 (Bedford et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020).
The remaining 55 genomes associate with clade B.1 and its
offshoots, which are characterized by the D614G mutation
in the spike and have prevailed globally since the spring of
2020 (Rambaut, Andrew et al., 2020)(Figure 1B). The genetic
variability in SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Bozeman (April to
July 2020) represents fourteen independent viral lineages, reflecting multiple introductions of the virus to the community
from many different sources (Figure S1A).
During the annotation of these genomes, we noticed a reoccurring (7 out of 56 genomes) 115 nt deletion in the gene
encoding accessory protein ORF7a (27,549 - 27,644 nt). The
ORF7a∆115 mutation was found in patient swabs collected
over a period of 1.5 months (Table S1). RT-PCR and Sanger
sequencing verified that all these seven ORF7a∆115 variants

are bona fide mutations and not a sequencing artifact (Figure
S1B, C). In addition to the ORF7a∆115 deletion, these genomes
also share 10 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared to
the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome. Seven of the 10 SNVs
are found frequently worldwide and are a signature of the
B1.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (Rambaut, Andrew et al., 2020).
The remaining 3 mutations are rare, do not co-occur in any
other genomes on GISAID, and lead to amino acid changes in
ORF3a (Q38P, L95F) and N (R195I) proteins. Interestingly,
one of the genomes in the ORF7a∆115 cluster has two additional SNVs that likely were acquired during circulation in the
community. This virus was sampled from a patient 41 days
after sampling the first ORF7a∆115 variant, which agrees well
with estimated SARS-CoV-2 mutation rates (2 nucleotides /
month) (van Dorp et al., 2020).
To determine if the ORF7a∆115 genotype is unique to Bozeman we downloaded an alignment of 180,971 SARS-CoV-2
genomes from GISAID, extracted ORF7a sequences and determined their mutational profiles. In total, we identified 845
unique ORF7a gene variants that are different from the WuhanHu-1 reference sequence. Next, we looked for mutations with
major effect on the ORF7a amino acid sequence. We identified 189 unique ORF7a variants (825 total sequences) with
frameshifts, deletions or missense mutations causing premature stop codons (Figure 1C). To understand the evolutionary history of these mutations, we integrated these genome
sequence into our phylogenetic analysis. Detected ORF7a
variants appear to have emerged independently on every continent and were not confined to any single lineage (Figure 1B;
Table S1). Next, we aligned translated ORF7a sequences to
look for patterns. Most of the identified ORF7a mutations
(126 out of 189) truncate the C terminus but preserve the
N-terminal half of the protein (Figure 1C and D). A portion
(36.5%) of these truncated ORF7a variants appeared in two or
more patient samples (116 max). While some of these ORF7a
mutants appear to have arisen on multiple independent occasions, others come from genomes that form monophyletic
clades, suggesting that viruses with ORF7a truncations are
capable of transmission within a host population (Figure 1C).
ORF7a truncation changes protein localization

ORF7a is a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal
immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) ectodomain, stalk, transmembrane (TM) domain and a short cytosolic tail (Figure 2A).
The two β sheets of the ectodomain are held together by two
disulfide bonds (i.e., Cys23-Cys58 and Cys35-Cys67) (Figure
2B). The cytosolic tail of ORF7a contains a dilysine (KRKTE)
ER retrieval signal (ERRS) that mediates protein trafficking
to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Nelson
et al., 2005).
The ∆115 nt mutation in ORF7a introduces a premature
stop codon that eliminates β 5, β 6 and β 7, two of the cystines
that form disulfides (Cys58 and Cys67), the TM and the cytosolic tail (Figures 2A and B). This truncation is expected
to destabilize the protein structure and significantly impact

protein function and trafficking in the host cell. To determine how loss of TM and sorting signal affects protein localization, we cloned and expressed Flag-tagged wildtype and
truncated ORF7a proteins in HEK 293T-hACE2 cells. The
wildtype ORF7a accumulated in the perinuclear region of the
cell, which is consistent with the previously reported ERGIC
localization (Figure 2D) (Martin-Sancho et al., 2020; Nelson
et al., 2005). In contrast, the truncated ORF7a is distributed
throughout the cytoplasm and does not associate with specific
subcellular compartments, which is consistent with the loss
of the TM domain and the ERRS signals required for protein
targeting (Figure 2E). Overall, we predict that the extent of
the truncation and the loss of intracellular targeting is likely
to affect ORF7a function (Gordon et al., 2020; Taylor et al.,
2015).

ORF7a mutation has no collateral effect on ORF7b

The ORF7a gene overlaps with the downstream ORF7b
gene (Figure S2). To determine if the ∆115 mutation in ORF7a
impacts ORF7b, we first examined whether it eliminates a
transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS) that is required for
subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) synthesis. None of the TRSs identified via direct RNA sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 overlap
with the ∆115 mutation site (Kim et al., 2020), suggesting
that ORF7b transcription is not affected (Figure S2). To confirm this prediction, we used RT-PCR with primers that detect
ORF7a and ORF7b sgRNAs (Figure 2F). In this assay, we
infected 293T-hACE2 cells (MOI = 0.05) with ORF7aWT or
ORF7a∆115 viral strains and extracted total RNA from cells at
24 hours post infection (hpi). Both viruses produced specific
RT-PCR products corresponding to ORF7a and ORF7b sgR-

impact ORF7b translation, we probed cell lysates 24 hpi with
an anti-ORF7b antibody (Figure 2G). We detected ORF7b
protein in both viral strains with band intensities that suggest
similar expression levels. Collectively, these data indicate
that the ORF7a∆115 mutation has no collateral effect on the
adjacent gene.

limited replication that resulted in only 18.6-fold and 7-fold
RNA level increase at 120 hpi in VeroE6 and 293T-hACE2, respectively. This growth defect reaches statistical significance
starting at 6 hpi in Vero E6 cells (p-value = 0.0135) and 24
hpi in 293T-hACE2 cells (p-value = 6.2*10-5 ).

ORF7a truncation results in a replication defect

To determine if this phenotype results from a defect in
viral egress only, or if viral RNA replication in the host is
also affected, we examined early steps in the infection. We
extracted total RNA from the infected 293T-hACE2 cells at
0.5, 6 and 24 hpi, and measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA with
RT-qPCR. Compared to wildtype, ORF7a∆115 RNA level was
reduced 2.1-fold inside the host at 6 hpi (p-value = 0.002) and
4.3-fold at 24 hpi (p-value = 0.02) (Figure 3C). This decrease
in viral RNA in the host cell differs from the corresponding decrease in the supernatant RNA at 24 hpi (4.3-fold vs 16.8-fold,

To determine if ORF7a truncations impact viral replication,
we infected 293T-hACE2 and Vero E6 cells with ORF7aWT
and ORF7a∆115 viruses at an MOI 0.05 and measured viral
RNA levels using RT-qPCR (Figure 3A and B). In this assay, we used viral strains sharing the same haplotype (C241T,
C3037T, C14408T, A23403G) that defines the SARS-CoV-2
B.1 lineage and its derivatives (Figure S3A) (Rambaut, Andrew et al., 2020). Over the course of 120 hours, ORF7aWT
viral RNA level increased 960-fold in supernatants from Vero

respectively; Figure 3B, C). This disparity suggests that the
ORF7a∆115 mutation might affect genomic RNA replication
and transcription, as well as viral egress.
ORF7a∆115 mutation alters host Type I interferon response
to SARS-CoV-2.

The ORF7a protein is not essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication (Xia et al., 2020). When overexpressed in vitro, ORF7a
suppresses type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling (Xia et al., 2020). Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) exert anti-viral activities and
thus we hypothesized that the replication defect in ORF7a∆115
results from impaired suppression of host anti-viral immune
responses. To test this hypothesis, we measured expression
of type I IFN response genes upon infection with ORF7aWT
and ORF7a∆115 strains using an RT-qPCR array targeting 91
human transcripts (Table S2). The array included 3 reference
genes that we used to normalize expression of 88 target genes.
In agreement with recent transcriptomic studies, we detected
a type I IFN-mediated antiviral response after infecting HEK
293T-hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Figure 3D, Figure
S3B) (Banerjee et al., 2020; Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Out
of 88 type I IFN response genes included in the RT-qPCR
array, 42 were differentially expressed (≥2-fold change, pvalue <0.05) in ORF7aWT infected cells and 55 in ORF7a∆115
infection, as compared to the non-infected control (Figure
3D, Figure S3B). Both viruses stimulated expression of multiple type-I interferon genes, antiviral ISGs, interleukins and
proinflammatory cytokines (Table S2).
To understand the effect of ORF7a∆115 on the host type
I IFN response, we compared expression of genes targeted
with RT-qPCR array between the two viruses. In general,
the ORF7a∆115 variant induces elevated type I IFN response
to the infection (Figure S3C, D). Analysis of genes differentially expressed between the two viral infections produced
an asymmetric volcano plot gravitating towards upregulation
(Figure 3E). A subset of ISGs had expression levels that are
significantly different (p-value <0.05) between the two viral
infections (Figure 3E, F, Table S2). This subset includes sensors (TLR7), signal transducers (MYD88, OAS2), transcriptional regulators (IRF3, IRF5) and restriction factors (GBP1,
IFITM3, MX1) known to combat infections by RNA viruses
(Schoggins, 2019). One of these differentially expressed ISGs
(IFITM3) restricts SARS-CoV-2 entry (Shi et al., 2020; Zang
et al., 2020). Additionally, polymorphisms in IFITM3, MX1
and TLR7 are linked to the severity of COVID-19 (Andolfo et
al., 2020; Jin, R. et al., 2020; Pati et al., 2021). This upregulation of ISGs indicates that the ORF7a∆115 mutation limits viral
suppression of the IFN-I response, which is consistent with
previous work suggesting that ORF7a prevents transcriptional
activation by STAT1/STAT2 complex (Xia et al., 2020). Collectively, our data show that a naturally occurring truncation
variant of the ORF7a protein alters the host innate immune
responses to the in vitro infection.

Discussion
In this study, we use genomic surveillance and phylogenetics to identify ORF7a variants that have emerged globally
throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Local occurrence of
ORF7a mutations has been reported by others (Addetia et al.,
2020; Holland et al., 2020; Rosenthal et al., 2020). However,
the effect of these mutations on viral fitness and host immune
responses has not been investigated. Here we have isolated an
ORF7a∆115 variant and show that this mutation results in an
in vitro growth defect. This defect is coupled with elevated
IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 and specifically ISGs.
Interferon systems are a frontline of host defense that signals infection and elicits an antiviral state (McNab et al., 2015).
Pretreatment with type I, type II and type III IFNs restricts
SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in cell culture (Mantlo
et al., 2020; Miorin et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 deploys multiple proteins (e.g., nsp6, nsp13, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and
ORF9b) to shut down IFN signaling and dampen innate immune responses (Jiang et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020; Xia et
al., 2020). In particular, when overexpressed ORF7a subverts
STAT2 phosphorylation, blocking IFN-dependent transcriptional activation of antiviral ISGs (Xia et al., 2020). Both
type I and III IFNs signal through the JAK-STAT pathway
and overlap substantially in the transcriptional responses they
induce (Kotenko and Durbin, 2017). Therefore, ORF7a likely
suppresses both IFN types, however its role in suppressing
the type III IFN response has yet to be verified (Xia et al.,
2020). The ORF7a∆115 variant impairs viral replication in
HEK 293T-hACE2 as well as in Vero E6, the latter of which
do not express type I IFN genes (Emeny and Morgan, 1979;
Osada et al., 2014). While type I IFN genes are deleted in
Vero E6 cells, the type III IFNs are intact and are activated
upon infection with RNA viruses, which results in ISG upregulation (Stoltz and Klingstrom, 2010; Wang et al., 2020).
Taken together, these data suggest that the growth defect of
the ORF7a∆115 strain in Vero E6 cells might result from a type
III IFN-dependent response that the virus fails to suppress.
Cytokine profiling and RNA-seq of clinical samples reveal
suppressed or delayed IFN responses in COVID-19 patients
(Arunachalam et al., 2020; Hadjadj et al., 2020; Lucas et
al., 2020). Dysregulated immune responses coupled with exacerbated inflammatory cytokines drive pathogenesis of the
disease and correlate with its severity (Jin, X. et al., 2020;
Tay et al., 2020; Zhou, F. et al., 2020). Here, we detected enhanced IFN signaling in cells infected with a naturally occurring ORF7a∆115 variant of SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate that
major truncation and loss of protein targeting (Figure 2) limit
the ability of ORF7a to suppress IFN signaling. Given the
importance of the IFN response in COVID-19, we anticipate
that ORF7a mutations might affect SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Clinical comparisons will be required to examine this
potential effect on COVID-19 features.

SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance identifies naturally occurring truncations of ORF7a that limit immune suppression.
— 7/11

Deletions in ORF7a, 7b and ORF8 have previously been
reported (Addetia et al., 2020; Holland et al., 2020; Rosenthal
et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020). Similar deletions emerged in
MERS- and SARS-CoV, which were linked to viral attenuation (Chinese, 2004; Muth et al., 2018). A 382-nt deletion
in ORF8 is associated with milder SARS-CoV-2 infection
in patients (Young et al., 2020). While this mutation affects
clinical features of COVID-19, it has no evident effect on viral replication or host transcriptional responses in human cell
culture (Pekosz et al., 2020). Overexpression of ORF8 results
in post-translational downregulation of MHC-I, therefore the
protein might modulate the interaction between infected cells
and immune system (Zhang et al., 2020).

Plasmids
Human-codon optimized dsDNA gene fragments (gBlocks) encoding for
SARS-CoV-2 C-terminally FLAG-tagged ORF7aWT and ORF7a∆115 proteins were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Sequence
of ORF7a from Wuhan-Hu-1 reference (genbank MN908947.3) was used
for ORF7aWT gBlock. The gene fragments were cloned into the pEGFP-N1
(Clontech cat# 6085-1) backbone to replace the eGFP gene.

Limitations of Study

The viral replication defect and cellular immune responses
presented here were performed using in vitro cell culture.
While HEK 293T-hACE2 and Vero E6 cells support virus
entry and replication (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Chu et
al., 2020), they may not recapitulate particular aspects of an
in vivo infection (Takayama, 2020). We anticipate that the in
vitro results presented here will provide important context for
clinical comparisons, similar to those recently published for
ORF8 (Young et al., 2020).

Materials and Methods
EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell cultures
HEK 293T-hACE2 cells (BEI, NR-52511) were generously provided by
Dr. Seth Pincus (Montana State University) and maintained at 37C and 5%
CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, cat. #12100061) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ATLAS Biologicals,
Lot. #F31E18D1), sodium bicarbonate (3.7 g/L), 50 I.U./mL penicillin and
50 µg/mL streptomycin. Vero E6 cells (ATCC R cat. #CRL-1586) were
maintained at 37C and 5% CO2 in Eagle’s Modified Eagle Medium (EMEM,
ATCC R , cat. #30-2003) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
ATLAS Biologicals, Lot. #F31E18D1) and 50 I.U./mL penicillin and 50
µg/mL streptomycin. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma.

inoculum at limiting dilutions. Inoculated cells were overlayed with either
0.75% methylcellulose, DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% penstrep and incubated for 4 days. Cells were fixed and stained with 0.5%
methylene blue in 70% ethanol. Plaques were counted and the overall titer was
calculated. Viral stocks identity was confirmed via whole genome sequencing
on Oxford Nanopore. All SARS-CoV-2 experiments were performed in a
BSL3 laboratory.

Symptom onset data and clinical test results
Suspect cases of COVID-19 were tested in a CLIA lab and instructed to selfquarantine until notified of the RT-qPCR test results. All laboratory confirmed
positive cases of COVID-19 were contacted via telephone by local public
health nurses to complete contact tracing. During this interview, the nurses
collected recorded symptoms, symptom onset date, travel history, contact
with other known laboratory confirmed cases, close contacts and activities
on the two days before symptom onset up until notification of a positive
test. Data collection was conducted as part of a public health response. The
study was reviewed by the Montana State University Institutional Review
Board (IRB) For the Protection of Human Subjects (FWA 00000165) and was
exempt from IRB oversight in accordance with Code of Federal regulations,
Part 46, section 101. All necessary patient/participant consent has been
obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.

METHOD DETAILS
Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
RT-qPCR was performed using CDC primers (N1 and N2) and probes from
the 2019-nCoV RUO Kit (IDT# 10006713). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified using one-step RT-qPCR in ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
according to CDC protocol (https://www.fda.gov/media/ 134922/download).
In brief, 20 µL reactions included 8.5 µL of Nuclease-free Water, 1.5 µL of

Primer and Probe mix (IDT, 10006713), 5 µL of TaqPath 1-Step RT-qPCR
Master Mix (ThermoFisher, A15299) and 5 µL of the template. Nucleasefree water was used as negative template control (NTC). Amplification was
performed using following program: 25C for 2 min, 50C for 15 min, 95C for
2 min followed by 45 cycles of 95C for 3 s and 55C for 30 s. Run data was
analyzed in SDS software v1.4 (Applied Biosystems). The NTC showed no
amplification throughout the 40 cycles of qPCR.

RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing
For sequencing 10 µL of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 positive patient sample
was reverse transcribed using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
according to the supplier’s protocol. The protocol developed by ARTIC
Network was used to generate and sequence amplicon library that covers
whole SARS-CoV-2 genome on Oxford Nanopore using ligation sequencing
kit (SQK-LSK109) (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) (Grubaugh et al., 2019;
Tyson et al., 2020). Briefly, two multiplex PCR reactions were performed
with primer pools from ARTIC nCoV-2019 V3 Panel (IDT, Table S3) using
Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). Reactions were
performed with the following thermocycling conditions: 98C for 2min, 30
cycles of 98C for 15 s and 65C for 5 min. Two resulting amplicon pools for
each patient sample were combined and used for library preparation. After
end repair (NEB E7546) samples were barcoded using Native Barcoding
Expansion Kits EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114 from Oxford Nanopore. A
total of 24 barcoded samples were pooled together and Nanopore adaptors
were ligated. After clean-up 20 ng of multiplexed library DNA was loaded
onto the MinION flowcell for sequencing. A total of 0.3 Gb of raw sequencing
data was collected per patient sample.

SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly
MinKNOW software was used to basecall raw Nanopore reads in highaccuracy mode. ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline for COVID-19 was used to analyze reads (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Pipeline included demultiplexing with guppy barcoder and generating consensus sequences with minimap2
and calling single nucleotide variants with nanopolish relative to Wuhan-Hu1/2019 reference genome (Li, 2018; Quick et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2020).
Consensus sequences were uploaded to GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/),
accession IDs are provided in Supplemental Table S1.

RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing
To verify the ORF7a∆115 mutation we used RT-PCR with primers that flank
the deletion region (Table S3). Reactions were performed with Q5 HighFidelity DNA Polymerase in 25 µL volume (New England Biolabs) using
following program: 98C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 98C for 15 s and 65C for 5
min, 35 cycles. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels stained with
SYBR Safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The remaining volume of the reaction
was purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research) and sent
to Psomagen for Sanger sequencing. Each PCR product was sequenced with
both forward and reverse primers used for PCR. To detect sgRNAs of ORF7a
and ORF7b primers annealing to Leader region of SARS-CoV-2 and inside
the ORF were used (Table S3). PCR products were cut out from 1% agarose
gel and purified with Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit. Purified products
were sequenced with forward and reverse primers. Sequence was verified by
aligning to SARS-CoV-2 genome in UGENE software (Unipro).

Phylogenetic and ORF7a mutational analysis
An alignment of 181,003 SARS-CoV-2 genomes was downloaded from
the GISAID database at 9:11 AM on 2020-11-11, and sequences without
corresponding metadata entries were removed. The nucleotide positions
encoding ORF7a in the reference sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1; EP ISL 402125)
were extracted for the remaining 180,971 sequences, and ORF7a sequences
with 100% sequence identity were clustered using CD-HIT (with settings:
-c 1 -aL 1). One representative was randomly selected from each of the 846
ORF7a sequence clusters and mutations in each nucleotide and translated
sequence were determined using the Biostrings package in R. Graphs of
these mutations were rendered with the ggplot2 package. To construct a
phylogenetic tree of global and Bozeman SARS-CoV-2 sequences, up to ten
sequences from each country in the world were selected for each month of
the pandemic using the Filter utility in the Augur pipeline (–group-by country
year month – sequences-per-group 10). This resulted in an alignment of 4,235
GISAID sequences. Then, the NextClade online tool was used to determine

the quality of 73 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (% genome covered) sequenced
from Bozeman patients. 56 Bozeman sequences that were determined to be
of “Good” quality were merged with the alignment of GISAID sequences,
as well as an alignment of 669 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes that
had non-synonymous mutations in ORF7a. The bat coronavirus RaTG13
(MN996532.2) and the Wuhan- Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were also
merged, resulting in an alignment of 4,959 full genome sequences, and
positions that are hypervariable or prone to sequencing artifacts were masked
with a VCF file downloaded from EMBL at 12:45PM on 2020-05- 29. The
alignment was trimmed of columns composed of 90% or more gaps using
Trimal (-gt 0.9), and IqTree was used to construct a maximum likelihood
phylogeny (-m GTR -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05). Branch lengths and internal nodes
were rescaled on the resulting tree using TreeTime, and tree was re-rooted to
the RaTG13 sequence using the APE package before being visualized with
the ggTree package in R.

Western Blot
293T-hACE2 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen,
L3000-015) with plasmids encoding for ORF7aWT, ORF7a∆115 or control
pEGFP-N1 plasmid. To detect ORF7b expression cells were infected with
ORF7aWT or ORF7a∆115 SARS-CoV-2 strains at MOI = 0.05. After 24
hours, cells were washed two times with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer
(150 mM sodium chloride, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2%
SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) at 4C for 30 min. The lysates were clarified by
centrifugation (10,000 g, 20 min) and stored at -80C. For Western blot lysates
were mixed with 6xLaemmli SDS-PAGE buffer and heated at 98C for 5 min,
resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF (ORF7b) or
nitrocellulose (ORF7a) membrane using Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic
Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, #1703930). Membranes were blocked and probed
with indicated antibodies. The proteins were visualized using Pierce ECL
Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, #32106) and exposed
to X-Ray film (sc-201696, Santa Cruz Biotech).

Immunocytochemistry
HEK 293T-hACE2 were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine
3000 (Invitrogen REF: L3000-015) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were either transfected with expression vectors for SARS-CoV-2
ORF7aWT, SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a∆115 , or mock transfected. 24 hours after
transfection, cells were detached and seeded at 50% confluency on glass
coverslips (Fisherbrand, #12-545-80) pre-coated with poly-D-lysine (Cultrex,
#3439-100-01) in a 24 well plate. The next day, media was removed, and
cells were washed with PBS and fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol on ice
for 10 minutes. Half of the methanol was replaced with PBS three times
before the methanol solution was discarded and cells were washed three times
in PBS (5 minutes each wash). Cells were blocked with 1% BSA (Fisher
Scientific BP9703-100) in PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. After blocking, cells were stained with mouse monoclonal
anti-Flag antibody (Invitrogen, MA1-91878) (1:200 in 1% BSA in PBST)
overnight at 4C. The next day, cells were washed 3X in PBS (5 min each)
and stained with secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA in PBST for
1 h at RT in the dark (Goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor488; Invitrogen, A11001).
After 3x PBS washes nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 5
minutes at RT. Coverslips were then mounted with ProLong Gold antifade
mounting media (Invitrogen, P36934) on Superfrost Plus microscope slides
(#22-037-246). Immunostained cells were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal
microscope.

SARS-CoV-2 replication assays
HEK 293T-hACE2 and Vero E6 cells were seeded in the 48-well plate and
infected with ORF7aWT or ORF7a∆115 SARS-CoV-2 strains at MOI = 0.05
in 50 µL of the cell culture media. Infections were performed in triplicates.
Next, 0.5 h post infection (hpi) 500 µL of the fresh cell culture media was
added to each well. The supernatants (140 ul) from the infected cells were
harvested at the following time points 0.5, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 120 hpi. The
RNAs from the supernatants were extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (QIAGEN) and used as an input in RT-qPCR with CDC N1 and N2
primers and probes as described above. Relative quantification was used
(∆Ct method) to calculate viral replication versus 0.5 hpi timepoint as 2-∆Ct.
The infected cells were harvested 0.5, 6 and 24 hpi and washed with PBS.
Total RNA from cells was extracted using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Cat No./ID:

74104) with on-column DNase digestion step (QIAGEN, 79254) according to
the manufacturers protocol. Viral RNA was quantified using RT-qPCR CDC
N1 primers and probe. Human ACTB endogenous control was quantified
with TaqMan assay (ThermoFisher, 4333762T). ∆∆Ct method was used to
normalize viral RNA level to host RNA and 0.5 hpi. Viral replication was
calculated for each replicate as 2-∆∆Ct.

Type I interferon response assay
HEK 293T-hACE2 were seeded in the 48-well plate and infected with
ORF7aWT or ORF7a∆115 SARS-CoV-2 strains at MOI = 0.05 in 50 µl
of the media. After 30 min on infection the 500 µL of the cell culture media
was added to each well. At 24 hpi the cells were washed once with PBS,
detached using Trypsin and the total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit
(QIAGEN, Cat No./ID: 74104) with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN,
Cat No./ID: 79254) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Non-infected
cells were processed using the same protocol with mock infection. After
extraction, 0,5-1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed Reverse using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to
the supplier’s protocol. The cDNA was diluted 10-fold in water and analyzed
with Type I interferon response (SAB Target List) H96 qPCR array. Each
reaction contained 2 µL of cDNA, 10 µL of 2X SsoAdvanced Universal
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 8 µL of water. Reactions were performed on QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System instrument with following
thermocycling conditions: 95C for 2min, 40 cycles of 95C for 5 s and 60C
for 30 s. After amplification, melt curve analysis was performed to examine
product specificity. Assay was performed in triplicates for non-infected cells
and both viruses. Run data was analyzed in PrimePCR Analysis software
(Bio-Rad). Expression of IFN-I response genes was normalized to geometric
mean of 3 reference transcripts (TBP, GAPDH, HPRT1) and non-infected
control (∆∆Ct method).

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical analyses were performed in RStudio v1.2.1335. Moving averages (n = 7) for symptom onset and positive COVID-19 tests data were
calculated using geom ma function from tidyquant package and plotted with
ggplot2 in RStudio. RT-qPCR data is shown as mean of three biological
replicates (each with three technical replicates) ± standard deviation (SD).
Replication of viruses and expression of IFN-I response genes was compared
using Student’s t-test. Medians of IFN-I response between two viruses were
compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Significance levels: * p <0.05, **
p <0.01, *** p <0.001 or ns (no significant difference, p >0.05).
