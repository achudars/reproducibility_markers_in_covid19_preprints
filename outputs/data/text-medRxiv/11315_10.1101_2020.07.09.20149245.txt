Dynamics of RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 Detection Rates
Prior to and After Symptom Onset
Scott Sherrill-Mix

Abstract
Effective RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treatment, surveillance and control of the COVID19 pandemic. A recent meta-analysis 1 suggested that testing prior to the onset of symptoms is likely to
miss the majority of infected individuals. These findings cast severe doubts on the effectiveness of mass
screening efforts intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 prior to the onset of symptoms and decrease community
transmissions from pre-/asymptomatic individuals 2–4 . However, alternative analyses and additional data
described herein refine these estimates and suggest that many SARS-CoV-2 infections could potentially be
detected prior to symptom onset.

Main
In a recently published study, Kucirka et al. 1 collected data from seven studies of RT-qPCR testing of
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 5–11 and concluded that detection of SARS-COV-2 was very difficult
prior to symptom onset and effectively impossible earlier than three days prior to symptom onset. However
the polynomial logistic regression model used for this analysis has the potential to underestimate uncertainty
in time periods with sparse data and unfortunately only three tests from a single patient were available
prior to the onset of symptoms. In order to more adequately account for this uncertainty, we developed a
Bayesian autoregressive moving average state space model (B-ARMA-SSM) and used Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampling to estimate posterior probabilities for parameters of interest from the data collected by
Kucirka et al. 1
For the day of and days following symptom onset, the detection rates estimated by the B-ARMA-SSM
and the polynomial model of Kucirka et al. 1 closely resembled each other (Figure 1). Both models estimated
a peak in detection rates 3–4 days after symptom onset followed by a progressive decline in the probability
of a positive detection. However in the days prior to symptom onset, the two models differed markedly
in their estimates of detection rates and in their confidence in these estimates. In spite of the data only
containing three tests in this time period, the polynomial model estimated very low detection rates, ostensibly
precisely and with little potential for error. In contrast, the B-ARMA-SSM estimated higher probabilities of
presymptomatic detection while displaying a much larger amount of uncertainty in its estimates (Figure 1).
For example, at 4 days prior to symptom onset the B-ARMA-SSM estimates a detection rate of 35% (95%
credible interval: 6–76%) while the polynomial model estimates a detection rate of 0% (95% CrI: 0–0%).
Intuitively, the larger confidence intervals seem more appropriate given the limited testing available but
without further data it is unclear which of these estimates is more likely to reflect reality.
Fortunately, additional data has become available allowing a test of the predictive powers of these models.
We identified 7 additional studies 2,3,12–16 by following the PubMed search strategy described previously 1 .
These new data contained 381 results from qPCR testing of 124 patients, including 21 patients measured
prior to symptom onset. Combined with the previous seven studies, these data contained the results of 1619
RT-qPCR tests.
Fitting the B-ARMA-SSM to this combined data produced an updated estimate with remarkable similarity to its previous predictions (Figure 2). In addition, the estimates fell well within the credible intervals
previously predicted by the model suggesting that the B-ARMA-SSM was able to adequately account for
uncertainty in the data. In contrast, the new data did not seem to agree with the predictions made by the

polynomial model. For example, the polynomial model predicted a 0% probability of detection earlier than
3 days prior to symptom onset yet 8 out of 13 tests administered between 4–7 days prior to symptom onset
were positive (Figure 2).
Overall, the B-ARMA-SSM estimated that in the combined data RT-qPCR detection rates averaged 80%
(95% CrI: 65–89%) on the day of symptom onset, increased to 86% (95% CrI: 76-92%) at three days after
symptoms and then fell steadily further into infection. Similarly, detection was estimated as increasingly
unlikely the earlier a patient was sampled prior to the onset of symptoms. For example, at 4 days prior
to symptom onset, the average detection rate was estimated at 56% (95% CrI: 30-79%) and at 8 days
prior to symptom onset, rates were estimated at 21% (95% CrI: 5-55%). Thus, detection of SARS-CoV-2
in presymptomatic individuals must be approached cautiously but is not nearly as difficult as previously
suggested.
The relatively high false negative rates in SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing predicted here and previously 1
is worrisome. Of course, what is a “false negative” depends greatly on the purpose of testing. If tests are
intended to provide documentation of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection then negative tests late in infection do
indeed represent false negatives. However with the rapid development of serological testing, the more likely
use for RT-qPCR testing is to detect positive cases prior to the onset of symptoms and to monitor viral
clearance after symptom onset. In these cases, many “false negatives” are likely to be due to the reduction
viral load to undetectable, and potentially less transmissible 2,4,15,17,18 , levels rather than a failure of PCR
testing. Thus at later time points, the false negative rate is likely overestimated. A similar problem arises in
the interpretation of rates prior to symptom onset where it is unclear if a false negative is due to a missed
test or instead because the patient has not yet been infected or reached significant levels of viral load.
In interpreting these data, it is also important to consider the limitations inherent to opportunistically
collected data. The collected studies varied in techniques, assays and patient populations and some studies
were estimated to have significantly higher or lower detection rates. For example, the van Kampen et al. 15
study was estimated to have the highest predicted detection rate with an estimated 97% (95% CrI: 94–95%)
probability of detection in infected patients at three days after symptom onset. In addition, these analyses
ignore censoring in the patient data. If a patient tests negative several times in a row then their doctor will
often not continue to test them which would bias late stage data towards towards patients with prolonged
disease. However, patient death or loss to followup due to more extreme disease progression could have an
opposing effect. Further data from prospective sampling of at risk patients is essential to further characterize
this critical period.
Population-wide screening efforts are being implemented in an attempt to reduce spread from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. An understanding of detection rates is
critical to these efforts. The preliminary analyses presented here suggest that, although testing will certainly
miss some infections, the detection of many presymptomatic individuals is indeed possible and offers the
potential to greatly reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 19? .

Methods
Data from seven studies 5–11 analyzed previously was obtained from Kucirka et al. 1 . Additional data was
collected from seven additional studies reporting testing in patients who developed symptoms, were tested
multiple times and tested positive at least once 2,3,12–16 . Where raw data were unavailable, data were
digitized from published plots. Data from Arons et al. 2 was provided by personal communication. Only
nasopharyngeal swabs were used from Xiao et al. 12 and tests detecting ≥ 1 PCR target were counted
as positives. Only upper respiratory tract samples were used from van Kampen et al. 15 The data from a
preprint by Kujawski et al. 8 in the initial data was replaced by data from the final publication by COVID-19
Investigation Team 20
In order to estimate the longitudinal progression of detection rates in SARS-CoV-2 patients, we developed
a Bayesian autoregressive moving average state space model (B-ARMA-SSM). This model attempts to reduce
potential misinterpretations in data sparse time periods by assuming simply that the detection rate on a
given day should on average resemble that of the previous day and that increases or decreases in detection
rate on a previous day will on average tend to continue. These probability are not directly observed but
are inferred from the counts of positive and negative tests. To anchor the model, detection at 20 days prior

to symptom onset is given a low prior probability. Differential detection rates in the individual studies are
modeled as a constant multiplicative change in odds ratio drawn from a normal distribution of potential
study offsets. The probabilities of RT-qPCR detection were thus:
xj,t ∼ Binomial(nj,t , pj,t )
logit(pj,t ) = βj + µt
µ−20 ∼ Normal(−8, 4)
µt = µt−1 + t if t > −20

Normal(0, σ)
if t = −19
t ∼
Normal(t−1 , σ) if t > −19
βj ∼ Normal(0, ψ)
σ ∼ Gamma(1, 1)
ψ ∼ Gamma(1, 1)
where xj,t is the number of positives out of nj,t total tests from study j at t days after symptom onset
with estimated binomial probability pj,t and study effect Bj . The posterior probabilities of the Bayesian
model were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as implemented in Stan 21 and analysis and
plotting were performed in R 22 .
