At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: COVID-19 associated respiratory failure leads
to a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. It is clear that there is heterogeneity in the
viral-induced host response leading to differential outcomes, even amongst those
treated with mechanical ventilation. There are many studies of COVID-19 disease which
use intubation status as an outcome or an inclusion criterion. However, there is less
understanding of the post intubation course in COVID-19.
What This Study Adds to the Field: We have developed and validated a novel
subphenotyping model based on post-intubation organ dysfunction trajectory in COVID19 patients. Specifically, we identified clear worsening and recovering organ dysfunction
trajectory subphenotypes, which are more predictive of outcomes than illness severity at
baseline. Dynamic inflammatory markers and ventilator variables rather than baseline
severity of illness, demographics and comorbidities differentiate the worsening and
recovering subphenotypes. Trajectory subphenotypes offer a potential road map for
understanding the evolution of critical illness in COVID-19.

Abstract
Rationale.

COVID-19-associated

respiratory

failure

offers

the

unprecedented

opportunity to evaluate the differential host response to a uniform pathogenic insult.
Prior studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have identified
subphenotypes with differential outcomes. Understanding whether there are distinct
subphenotypes of severe COVID-19 may offer insight into its pathophysiology.
Objectives. To identify and characterize distinct subphenotypes of COVID-19 critical
illness defined by the post-intubation trajectory of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) score.
Methods. Intubated COVID-19 patients at two hospitals in New York city were
leveraged as development and validation cohorts. Patients were grouped into mild,
intermediate, and severe strata by their baseline post-intubation SOFA. Hierarchical
agglomerative clustering was performed within each stratum to detect subphenotypes
based on similarities amongst SOFA score trajectories evaluated by Dynamic Time
Warping. Statistical tests defined trajectory subphenotype predictive markers.
Measurements and Main Results. Distinct worsening and recovering subphenotypes
were identified within each stratum, which had distinct 7-day post-intubation SOFA
progression trends. Patients in the worsening suphenotypes had a higher mortality than
those in the recovering subphenotypes within each stratum (mild stratum, 29.7% vs.
10.3%, p=0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p=0.002; severe stratum, 53.7%
vs. 22.2%, p<0.001). Worsening and recovering subphenotypes were replicated in the
validation cohort. Routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and respiratory variables rather

than demographics and comorbidities were predictive of the worsening and recovering
subphenotypes.
Conclusions. There are clear worsening and recovering subphenotypes of COVID-19
respiratory failure after intubation, which are more predictive of outcomes than baseline
severity of illness. Organ dysfunction trajectory may be well suited as a surrogate for
research in COVID-19 respiratory failure.

Main text

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented opportunity to explore a large
cohort of patients infected with a single pathogen thus providing a window to examine
patient variability in response to a uniform insult. Despite this opportunity, distinct
subphenotypes of severe-COVID-19 associated respiratory failure remain largely
unexplored(1-3). SARS-CoV-2 infection often leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure
requiring treatment with mechanical ventilation which meets clinical and pathologic
criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)(4-6). In COVID-19 respiratory
failure, like other forms of ARDS, there is significant risk of morbidity and mortality.
However, there is clear heterogeneity in outcomes, even in those treated with
mechanical ventilation(4, 5, 7-9). The baseline clinical characteristics and predictors of
mortality of those requiring mechanical ventilation have been described(4, 7, 8, 10).
These studies offer some insight into a differential host response but are limited to
characterizing patients at baseline.
In prior studies of ARDS(11, 12), unique subphenotypes have been described,
which identify hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory populations with differential
demographics, clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers and outcomes. These
subphenotypes are primarily characterized by host response inflammatory markers and
patterns of organ injury, but are agnostic of the type of insult or infection. In COVID-19,
baseline risk stratification may be insufficient to characterize subphenotypes that
accurately reflect the complexity of the disease arc(13). Serial, temporally ordered,

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)(14-17) and comprehensive Electronic
Health Records (EHR) data are well suited to develop data-driven subphenotypes(18),
where the goal is to identify coherent patient groups with similar clinical courses.
Dynamic time warping (DTW)(19) is a well-established technique for evaluating the
similarities among temporal sequences(20, 21). DTW is particularly well suited to
evaluate longitudinal changes in organ dysfunction in COVID19. Characterizing a more
complete representation of the disease course in COVID19 may offer insight into its
pathophysiology.
We used DTW to conduct a two staged post-intubation trajectory analysis of
SOFA-based organ dysfunction in patients with COVID19 to identify unique
subphenotypes. In order to understand the differential disease course, we then explored
clinical

demographics,

characteristics, inflammatory markers, and treatments predictive of these trajectories.

Methods

This was a retrospective two staged modeling analysis on two cohorts of intubated
COVID-19 patients. The overall workflow of our study is illustrated in Figure 1.

Study design and cohort description
We used individual patient data from two New York Presbyterian (NYP) system
hospitals located in New York city: the New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell

Medical Center (NYP-WCMC), an 862-bed quaternary care hospital, and the New York
Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital (NYP-LMH), a 180-bed non-teaching academic
affiliated hospital. Patients were admitted from Mar 3, 2020 to May 12, 2020. SARSCoV2 diagnosis was made through reverse-transcriptase–PCR assays performed on
nasopharyngeal swabs. The critical care response to the pandemic has been previously
described(22). The NYP-WCMC cohort was used as the development cohort to derive
subphenotypes, and the NYP-LMH cohort was used for validation. The focus of this
study was critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated with intubation
(Supplemental Appendix 1).

Data collection
We collected all data from either the Weill Cornell-Critical carE Database for Advanced
Research (WC-CEDAR), Weill Cornell Medicine COVID Institutional Data Repository
(COVID-IDR), or via manual chart abstraction (REDCap). WC-CEDAR aggregates and
transforms data from institutional electronic health records for all patients treated in
ICUs in NYP-WCMC and NYP-LMH(23). The COVID-IDR contains additional aggregate
EHR data on all patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at NYP-WCMC or NYP-LMH.
The REDCap database contains high-quality manually abstracted data on all patients
who tested positive for COVID-19 at NYP-WCMC or NYP-LMH(24). In our analysis, the
patient information incorporated included demographics, laboratory tests, vital signs,
and respiratory variables obtained from WC-CEDAR, comorbidity information obtained

from the REDCap database, and medication data obtained from the COVID-IDR. Data
analyzed were detailed in Supplemental Appendix 2.

SOFA calculation
The SOFA score is the sum of six organ dysfunction subscores, including
cardiovascular, central nervous system (CNS), coagulation, liver, renal, and
respiration(14, 17). In this study, the CNS, coagulation, liver, and renal subscores were
derived according to the standard SOFA scoring system(14). The respiration subscore
was calculated using a combination of the traditional and modified scoring method(25).
The cardiovascular SOFA subscore was calculated with additional vasopressors
according to a norepinephrine equivalency table, where phenylephrine and vasopressin
were converted to a norepinephrine equivalency(26). SOFA scores were derived every
24 hours from the time of intubation, and the worst score within that 24-hour data period
was selected for each patient .(14)

Inclusion exclusion criteria
We included patients with positive results on viral RNA detection by real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test from nasopharyngeal swabs
specimens and treated with mechanical ventilation at the ICU in NYP-WCM and NYPLMH. We excluded patients who were less than 18 years old. Since our aim was to
identify clinically meaningful organ dysfunction progression patterns of intubated
patients, trajectories with low quality (20 (5.7%) patients missing over 50% SOFA

records) and outlier trajectories (10 (2.9%) patients with unchanged or heavily fluctuated
within the 7-day window after intubation) were excluded from the analysis
(Supplemental Appendix 3 and Figure E-1).

Subphenotyping model description
SOFA scores were derived every 24 hours and post intubation 7 day SOFA trajectories
were constructed for analysis. Missing values within a trajectory were imputed based on
the last observation carried forward (LOCF) strategy.
A two-staged subphenotyping method was performed to derive SOFA trajectory
subphenotypes (Figure 1). In the first stage, we used baseline SOFA to group patients
with a similar upfront risk of death(17), as additive organ dysfunction has previously
been identified to be associated with poor outcomes in COVID19(8). We partitioned the
patients into three baseline severity strata (mild, intermediate, and severe) according to
their SOFA scores within the first 24 hours after intubation. The SOFA score cut-offs
were set to 0-10, 11-12, and 13-24 in order to obtain a balanced distribution of patients
across the three strata. In the second stage, we identified the subphenotypes with
similar 7-day SOFA progression patterns. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)(19) was
adopted to evaluate the similarities between pairwise patient SOFA trajectories within
each baseline stratum and then hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC)(27) was
performed on these similarities to derive the similar patient clusters as trajectory
subphenotypes. DTW can account for the differences among the evolution
heterogeneity among the temporal curves and is thus able to evaluate their similarity
more robustly.(19) The optimal numbers of subphenotypes were determined by clear

separation illustrated by clustergram according to the McClain index(28). DTW was
implemented with Python 3.7 based on tslearn package 0.3.1 and HAC was performed
with Python 3.7 based on scikit-learn package 0.22.2.
To validate these findings, we replicated these subphenotypes from the NYPLMH cohort.

Clinical outcomes
We analyzed 30-day all-cause mortality as the primary outcome for patients within each
phenotype. Successful extubation or need for tracheostomy within 30 days after
intubation were secondary outcomes.

Statistical analysis
We examined the associations between patient characteristics and clinical variables
and the identified trajectory subphenotypes, to see if there are early markers that can
discriminate

them.

peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure, driving pressure, static compliance, minute
ventilation, ventilatory ratio, and tidal volume indexed to ideal body weight at day 1 and
day 3 post-intubation.
Univariate statistical tests were performed in those association analyses.
Specifically, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, with Tukey HSD post hoc test),
Kruskal–Wallis test (with Dunn post hoc test), student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Chisquare test, and Fisher’s exact test have been used whenever appropriate. The pvalues were then corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR)
estimation. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for the between-strata/subphenotypes
comparisons was also applied based on the generalized linear model (GLM) with
adjustment on age at baseline. All statistical tests were performed with Python 3.7
based on statsmodels package 0.11.1.

Subphenotype prediction modeling
We trained a random forest model with the trajectory subphenotypes as targets and the
patient clinical characteristics at specific time points after intubation as input predictors
to define if these trajectory subphenotypes can be predicted early. Our implementation
was with Python 3.7 based on scikit-learn package 0.22.2. Candidate predictors
included demographics, comorbidities, medications prescribed around the intubation
event, SOFA subscores, laboratory tests, vital signs, and respiratory variables as
described above. Prediction performances were measured by area under the receiver
operating characteristics (AUC-ROC). The importance of predictors was visualized as a
heatmap to demonstrate their contributions on subphenotype prediction.

Results
Patients and baseline severity strata
A total of 318 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from the NYP-WCMC cohort
were included for analysis, consisting of 100 females (31.45%) and an average age of
62.78 േ 14.34. One day post-intubation the mean SOFA score for this cohort is 11.89 േ
2.56. A total of 84 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from the NYP-LMH were
included as a validation cohort, consisting of 33 (39.29%) females and an average age
of 66.06 േ 13.06. One day post-intubation the mean SOFA score is 12.51 േ 2.25. The
clinical characteristics of both cohorts are summarized in Table 1.

For the NYP-WCMC cohort, patients were first partitioned into mild, intermediate, and
severe strata based on the SOFA scores within one day after intubation, consisting of
76 (23.29%), 116 (36.48%), and 126 (39.62%) patients, respectively; while for the NYPLMH validation cohort, the three strata consist of 10 (11.90%), 35 (41.67%), and 39
(46.43%) patients, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the patients in both NYP-WCMC
and NYP-LMH cohorts exhibit additive patterns of post intubation baseline organ

dysfunction according to the SOFA subscores. Specifically, CNS and respiration
dysfunction were present in the mild stratum; the intermediate stratum had additional
cardiovascular dysfunction on top of CNS and respiratory dysfunction compared to the
mild stratum; and the severe stratum had renal dysfunction in addition to all other organ
failure. Liver and coagulation dysfunction were rare in all strata. Patients in the severe
stratum were generally older and were more likely to suffer from chronic comorbidities
at baseline.

SOFA trajectory subphenotypes
The clustergrams built upon the pairwise SOFA trajectory distance matrix derived by
DTW are shown in Supplemental Figure E-2. The optimal number of subphenotypes
within each stratum as determined by the McClain Index(28) are shown in Supplemental
Table E-1, suggesting two being the best choice across all strata in both cohorts. Figure
2 demonstrates the individual averaged SOFA curves for patients in the two
subphenotypes across all strata: a worsening subphenotype of which SOFA score
increased within the 7-day observation window, and a recovering subphenotype of
which SOFA score improved. The clinical characteristics of these subphenotypes were
summarized in Table 2. Overall, there was no marked difference in terms of
demographics, comorbidity burden, and pattern of organ dysfunction (distribution of

subphenotypes within each baseline severity stratum at baseline. This suggests that,

medications prescribed within each subphenotype and didn’t find significant signal as
well (Supplemental Table E-3). In addition, clinical characteristics and medications of
the subphenotypes re-derived in the NYP-LMH validation cohort were summarized in
Supplemental Tables E-2 and 4.

30-days clinical outcomes
Statistics of 30-day post-intubation clinical primary and secondary outcomes (mortality,
extubation, and tracheostomy) of subphenotypes were illustrated in Figure 2A and
Supplemental Figure E-3A. The worsening subphenotypes, across baseline strata,
suffered from a significantly higher risk of mortality within the 30-day window after
intubation (worsening vs recovering, mortality proportion: mild stratum, 29.7% vs. 10.3%,
p=0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p=0.002; severe stratum, 53.7% vs.
22.2%, p<0.001). The recovering subphenotypes, across all baseline strata, showed
significantly higher extubation proportions within the 30-day window compared to the
worsening subphenotypes (recovering vs. worsening, extubation proportion: mild
stratum, 76.9% vs. 27.0%, p<0.001; intermediate stratum, 54.7% vs. 31.7%, p=0.018;
severe stratum 50.0% vs. 14.8%, p<0.001). There was no significant difference of 30day tracheostomy detected between the subphenotypes. Importantly, the recovering
subphenotype within the severe baseline stratum had a lower mortality risk compared to
the worsening subphenotypes at mild and intermediate baseline strata.
The trajectory subphenotypes derived in the NYP-LMH validation cohort had
similar trends in all three clinical outcomes within the 30-day window after intubation
(see Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure E-3B). Across all baseline strata, the

worsening subphenotypes accounted for higher risk of mortality (worsening vs
recovering, mortality proportion: mild stratum, 57.1% vs. 0.0%, p=0.200; intermediate
stratum, 31.8% vs. 7.7%, p=0.211; severe stratum, 83.3% vs. 17.4%, p<0.001), while
the recovering subphenotypes showed higher extubation proportion within 30-days after
intubation (recovering vs. worsening, extubation proportion: mild stratum, 33.3% vs.
14.3%, p=0.490; intermediate stratum, 69.2% vs. 27.3%, p=0.015; severe stratum, 48.1%
vs. 9.1%, p=0.017).

Correlation of subphenotypes with early-stage markers
Vital signs, laboratory variables, and respiratory variables were evaluated to identify
early-stage markers predictive of the two-stage classification. First of all, the three
baseline strata of the NYP-WCMC cohort were observed to be well separated by a
series of clinical variables in addition to the differential organ dysfunction pattern noted
above (Supplemental Table E-5). For instance, ANOVA(or Kruskal–Wallis test) results
showed significantly increased laboratory values like procalcitonin, ferritin, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine, and decreased carbon dioxide within the severe
stratum, at day 1 post-intubation; Vital sign such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
and urine output volume and respiratory variables such as peak inspiratory pressure
(PIP) were also observed to separate the strata; the mild stratum was associated with
significantly decreased levels of troponin, creatinine, and glucose. Detailed statistical
analyses are described in Supplemental Table E-5. Statistics of these clinical variables
across baseline strata within the NYP-LMH validation cohort showed similar signals and
were detailed in Supplemental Table E-6.

We further evaluated the clinical variable values at day 1 and day 3 postintubation to compare the worsening and recovering subphenotypes within each
baseline stratum. Markers, which significantly separated the worsening and recovering
subphenotypes (p-value<0.05), varied across different baseline strata (Supplemental
Table E-7). Specifically, on day 1, laboratory tests including white blood cell (WBC)
count, procalcitonin, CRP, creatinine, neutrophil count, and globulin, and respiratory
variables such as minute ventilation and ratio of tidal volume to predicted body weight
(PBW) were found to significantly differentiate the trajectory subphenotypes within the
mild stratum. Markers that significantly separated the trajectory subphenotypes within
the intermediate stratum on day 1 included AST, creatinine, LDH and FiO2. The severe
stratum had more markers separating the worsening and recovering subphenotypes on
day 1, including laboratory tests like lymphocyte count, platelet count, triglycerides,
procalcitonin level, ferritin, troponin, LDH, creatinine, and AST, respiratory variables
such as PIP, PaO2, PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio), and SpO2. In addition, more markers
separating subphenotypes emerged within each stratum on day 3 after intubation. For
instance, additional day 3 markers including GCS, platelet, sodium, and glucose were
found within the mild stratum. For the intermediate stratum, GCS, albumin, WBC count,
lymphocyte percentage, CRP, sodium, neutrophil percentage and count, carbon dioxide
level, urine output volume, and P/F ratio were found to be additional markers on day 3.
The additional markers found within the severe stratum on day 3 included vital signs
GCS and temperature, lymphocyte percentage, hemoglobin level, albumin level,
potassium level, ESR, CK, carbon dioxide level, and lactic acid, positive end-expiratory

pressure (PEEP), plateau pressure, minute ventilation, static compliance, driving
pressure, FiO2, and ventilator ratio.
As shown in Supplemental Table E-8, most markers identified within the NYPWCMC cohort showed consistent signals within the NYP-LMH subphenotypes, even
though some significance vanishes, as the confidence intervals were wide.

Subphenotype prediction models
We trained random forest models for predicting the worsening and recovering trajectory
subphenotypes within each baseline stratum according to the early stage marker values.
Overall, as shown in Supplemental Figure E-4, within the mild, intermediate, and severe
strata, the prediction models achieved the AUC-ROCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval

respectively, with the predictor values evaluated at day 1 post-intubation. AUC-ROCs of
the models increased to 0.77 (95% CI, [0.66, 0.89]), 0.77 (95% CI, [0.74, 0.81]), and
0.80 (95% CI, [0.75, 0.85]), with the predictor values evaluated at day 3 post-intubation;

0.95]), with the predictor values evaluated at day 5 post-intubation.
Importance of the predictors were illustrated as heatmaps, where color intensity
represents the normalized importance of specific predictors (Supplemental Figure E-5).
Generally, predictor importance varied as the progress of time. Models trained on day 13 after intubation were observed to involve more contributions from the laboratory tests,
vital signs, respiratory variables than other predictors; SOFA subscores, especially

cardiovascular, CNS, and renal subscores showed relatively higher importance over
models trained on day 4 or 5 data within the intermediate and severe strata. Age
contributed to day 1-3 prediction to some extent, while other demographics, medications
and comorbidities showed weak importance in prediction.

Correlation to blood type
We finally assessed ABO/RH blood type distribution across the subphenotypes
(Supplemental Tables E-9 and 10). Overall, there is no significant signal detected.

Discussion:
In this study, we identified novel trajectory subphenotypes of COVID-19 patients with an
objective machine learning approach. The subphenotypes we identified are based on
organ dysfunction trajectory over 7-days following intubation, which is different from
existing data-driven subphenotyping methods that focus on patient data at a specific
timestamp (12, 30, 31). The use of novel methodology, in addition to the robust size of
our cohort, ensure that the identified trajectory based subphenotypes are less likely to
suffer from cognitive bias(13) and are likely to be temporally stable(32). More concretely,
we adopted a divide and conquer approach to identify the subphenotypes. Prior
research has identified that additive organ dysfunction is predictive of increased
mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS(8). Therefore, we divided the patients into
three different baseline strata (mild, intermediate and severe) according to additive

SOFA based organ dysfunction. We identified two salient trajectory subphenotypes
within each stratum.
Importantly, the baseline demographics, comorbidities and pattern of organ
dysfunction did not differ between the worsening and recovering subphenotypes at each
stratum. This suggests the existence of differential progression pathways that are
irrespective of baseline risk factors for severe disease. This finding is unique compared
to other subphenotyping projects as we are including a more complete picture of the
disease course(12, 30, 31). It also highlights the temporal heterogeneity of COVID-19
and the importance of avoiding prognostication based on early post intubation clinical
characteristics. We found that the worsening subphenotypes in the baseline mild and
intermediate strata showed an even higher risk of death compared to the recovering
subphenotype within the baseline severe stratum (Figure 3). Indeed, there is an urgent
need to understand the pathophysiology of progressive non-pulmonary organ
dysfunction in this disease.
We assessed the differences between a broad range of laboratory tests, vital
signs, and respiratory variables in the worsening and recovering subphenotypes.
Importantly, basic laboratory tests and inflammatory markers were differentially
associated with the worsening and recovering subphenotypes over time, which
suggests that there is value in clinically following markers such as D-dimer, LDH, ferritin,
procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. In the mild stratum, markers from the regular blood
panel such as total white blood cell count and neutrophil counts, while inflammatory
markers, such as ferritin and LDH, differentiate in the severe stratum. Laboratory tests,
vitals and inflammatory markers in the intermediate stratum were less able to

distinguish between the worsening and recovering subphenotypes. However,
differences emerged over a longer time horizon (e.g., day 3). This further highlights the
dynamic nature of COVID-19 and the difficulty in early prognosis in the critically ill
population, despite severely deranged baseline organ dysfunction and inflammatory
markers.

subphenotypes from patient baseline characteristics and early-stage clinical feature
values. Models were built on at successive time points (day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) after
intubation. Predictive performances measured by AUC-ROC improved as the number of
days increased. The predictors’ importance to differentiating worsening and recovering
subphenotypes showed varying patterns (Figure E-5). Importantly, aside from age and
BMI, demographics, baseline comorbidities, and medications prescribed around
intubation did not contribute to discriminating the subphenotypes in any of the strata.
The persistence or development of renal failure, predicts subphenotype assignment
later in the severe and intermediate strata, respectively. The persistence of vasodilatory
shock in the intermediate stratum predicts the worsening subphenotype. While the
development of thrombocytopenia, is discriminative late in the severe stratum.
Interestingly, over the course of the first 7 days following intubation, liver failure
remained rare. At different points in the course, inflammatory markers such as creatine
kinase and D-dimer predicted worsening and recovering subphenotypes.
Our study was conducted on the two NYP system hospitals. Woresning and
recovering SOFA subphenotypes, clinical characteristics, and outcomes from the
validation cohort was consistent with the original subphenotypes. Although, due to the

limited size of NYP-LMH validation cohort, statistical significance of some markers
vanished, most of the results reflected the development cohort’s findings. This
consistency ensures the existence of the worsening and recovering trajectory
subphenotypes at each baseline stratum of the critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Limitations
While this study presents a step forward in the efforts to parse the progression
heterogeneity of critically ill patients with COVID-19, several limitations remain. The first
limitation could be SOFA’s inadequacy in tabulating organ dysfunction in COVID-19
associated respiratory failure. For example, COVID-19 is associated with a different
pattern of hypercoagulability compared to sepsis, which is reflected in the preserved
platelet count in most this cohort’s patients.(33) Also despite elevations in liver
chemistries in many patients, hyperbilirubinemia was rare. Despite this limitation, SOFA
trajectory subphenotypes predicted mortality and will allow for future comparisons with
other diseases.
Second, we did not use the progression of inflammatory markers such as Creactive protein, D-dimer or ferritin, which are known risk factors for this disease, to
identify the subphenotypes. Nor did we stratify patients based the severity of respiratory
failure alone. Instead, we chose to see how these factors interacted with traditional
organ dysfunction, as most patients with COVID19 die from multisystem organ failure
and not refractory respiratory failure(8, 9).
Third, differentiating trajectory subphenotypes in this critically ill population was
difficult, as AUC-ROC metrics of prediction modeling using data at day 1 post-intubation
were around 0.7. By restricting our analysis to a very high-risk population, we
17

decreased the discriminative power of many of our biomarkers to predict outcomes. All
patients were high risk. However, we have added to our understanding of patients with
critical COVID-19, by documenting the natural history of organ dysfunction in this
population. Future research efforts, with novel biomarkers, are needed to predict
worsening and recovering subphenotypes at an earlier time point in those with
respiratory failure.
Fourth, the surge conditions in New York City during the study period could affect
the study. Care may have been influenced by the surge conditions during this difficult
time. However, all patients were cared for in a critical care environment and despite the
massive patient burden, the all cause 30-day mortality was 25.9%.

Conclusions
In a population of critically ill patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure, there are
distinct worsening and recovering organ dysfunction trajectory subphenotypes.
Worsening status was predictive of poor outcomes in all strata regardless of baseline
severity. These findings highlight the importance of supportive care for sequential organ
failure in addition to respiratory failure in this disease. Trajectory based subphenotypes
offer a potential road map for understanding the evolution of critical illness in COVID-19.
We call for further analysis.

Figures

Figure 1. A schematic of the analysis plan. Intubated patients of two cohorts, New
NYP-WCMC and NYP-LMH cohorts were analyzed, as development and validation
cohorts, respectively. 7-day post-intubation SOFA trajectories were constructed. A twostage subphenotyping model was then performed on the top of the SOFA trajectories.
Statistical testing and prediction modeling were finally performed to identify markers at
early-stage after intubation for separating the identified trajectory subphenotypes.

Supplementary Materials

Appendix 1. Patient care.
Care of the patient was at the discretion of each attending physician. Patients were
intubated prior to arrival to the ICU. Daily briefings were held during the surge to
reinforce best practices and evidence related to caring for acute hypoxemic respiratory
failure. Volume control ventilation targeting a tidal volume of 6-8 mls/kg IDBW and a
plateau pressure < 30 cm/h20 was recommended. No particular PEEP titration protocol
was mandated, however the ARDSnet moderate and high PEEP documents were made
available to practitioners. Propofol was the first sedative of choice with the addition of
opiates for dyspnea and perceived pain. An even to positive fluid balance was
suggested on days one and two of mechanical ventilation. Patients with hypotension
despite volume loading were treated with vasopressors, norepinephrine as the first
choice to target a MAP of 65 mmhg. Prone positioning was suggested if a patient had a
PF ratio of <150 despite optimization of PEEP and vent synchrony. Neuromuscular
blockade was suggested in cases of refractory hypoxemia. Inhaled nitric oxide was
available in cases of refractory respiratory failure at the discretion of the treating
intensivists. Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation support was not offered due to
resource limitations. HProphylactic anticoagulation was recommended for all patients
and a higher dose prophylactic regimen was implemented during the course of the
surge. Enoxaparin was the recommended first choice anticoagulation, even in the
setting of renal insufficiency with strict monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels. Heparin was
used for patients with concern for active bleeding or patients unable to tolerate

azithromycin was used to treat most patients as an antiviral. Remdesivir was available
through compassionate use and through several clinical trials. Off label use of IL-6
inhibition was directed by consultation with infectious disease physicians. Choices
regarding antibiotics and other therapeutics were at the discretion of treating intensivists
with consultation with infectious disease physicians.

Appendix 2. Data description.
In this study, all data were collected from either the Weill Cornell-Critical carE Database
for Advanced Research (WC-CEDAR)(1), Weill Cornell Medicine COVID Institutional
Data Repository (COVID-IDR)(2), or via manual chart abstraction (REDCap). A wide
range of data were included for analysis, including:

● Demographics include age, sex, race, and body mass index (BMI) were obtained
when admitted to ICU.

● Chronic comorbidities were assessed at ICU admission and collected via chart
abstraction.

Comorbidities

studied

include

coronary

artery

disease,

cerebrovascular accident (stroke), heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
pulmonary disease, renal disease, cirrhosis, hepatitis, active cancer, transplant,
inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency viruses, rheumatologic

● Medications prescribed were collected from the COVID-IDR database.
Medications screened include tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids
(such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone),
enoxaparin, heparin, and antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone, azithromycin, piperacillintazobactam, meropenem, vancomycin, and doxycycline). Enoxaparin was further
assessed as prophylactic dose (<.5 mg per KG), high prophylactic dose (<1 mg per KG),
and treatment dose (>1 mg per KG), while heparin was assessed as prophylactic

dose (subcutaneous delivery) and treatment dose (intravenous delivery).

● In order to identify markers associated to identified subphenotypes, we assessed
a broad spectrum of laboratory tests related to organ failure, including alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), albumin level, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total
bilirubin, carbon dioxide, creatine kinase (CK) level, creatinine,

C-reactive

protein (CRP) level, D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin level,
globulin level, glucose level, hemoglobin level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
lactic acid level, lymphocyte percentage and count, neutrophil percentage and
count, platelets level, potassium level, procalcitonin level, sodium level, troponin
level, triglycerides, and white blood cell (WBC) count.

● Several vital signs were also assessed, including Glasgow Coma Scale score
(GCS), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), temperature.

● Clinical variables reflecting respiratory status of patients were also studied,
including fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2),
PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio), and oxygen saturation (SpO2).

● Several parameters of ventilator setting were studied, including driving pressure,
minute ventilation, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) level,
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), PH, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP),
plateau pressure, static compliance, tidal volume, tidal volume to predicted body
weight (PBW) ratio, and ventilator ratio.

● ABO/RH blood type data were collected from COVID-IDR database.

Appendix 3. Inclusion exclusion criteria
Inclusion: We included patients with positive results on viral RNA detection by real-time
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test from nasopharyngeal
swabs specimens and treated with mechanical ventilation at the ICU in NYP-WCMC
and NYP-LMH.
Exclusion:
•

Patients who were less than 18 years old when admitted to ICU were excluded
for analysis.

•

Since our aim was to identify organ dysfunction progression patterns within 7days after intubation, missing too many (>50%) SOFA data may mislead
understanding the trajectory trends. Hence, we excluded patients with ൑3 days
SOFA data. Specifically, 20 patients of NYP-WCMC cohort were excluded,
among which 9, 3, and 3 dead within day 1, 2, 3 after intubation, respectively, 2
have no records, and 2 and 1 only have 2- and 3-days SOFA data, respectively.

11 patients of NYP-LMH cohort were excluded, among which 2, 5, and 4 dead
within day 1, 2, 3 after intubation, respectively.
•

Outliers such as unchanged or heavily fluctuated trajectories which may hamper
the model to capture clinically meaningful SOFA progression trends were
excluded for analysis. Specifically, 7 unchanged trajectories of NYP-WCM cohort,
and 3 and 5 heavily fluctuated trajectories within 7-day post-intubation of NYPWCMC and NYP-LMH cohorts were excluded for analysis.

The overall inclusion exclusion criteria were provided in Figure E-1.
