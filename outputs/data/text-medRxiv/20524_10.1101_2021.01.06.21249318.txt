Abstract

We present a mathematical model for the simulation of the development of an outbreak of COVID-19 in a slum area under dierent interventions. Instead of representing interventions as modulations of the parameters of a free running epidemic we introduce a model structure that
accounts for the actions but does not assume the results.

The disease

is modelled in terms of the progression of viremia reported in scientic
works. The emergence of symptoms in the model reects the statistics of a
nation-wide highly detailed database consisting of more than 62000 cases
(about a half of the conrmed by RT-PCR tests) with recorded symptoms
in Argentina. The stochastic model displays several of the characteristics
of COVID-19 such as a high variability in the evolution of the outbreaks,
including long periods in which they run undetected, spontaneous extinction followed by a late outbreak and unimodal as well as bimodal
progressions of daily counts of cases (second waves without ad-hoc hypothesis). We show how the relation between undetected cases (including
the asymptomatic cases) and detected cases changes as a function of
the public policies, the eciency of the implementation and the timing
with respect to the development of the outbreak. We show also that the
relation between detected cases and total cases strongly depends on the
implemented policies and that detected cases cannot be regarded as a
measure of the outbreak, being the dependency between total cases and
detected cases in general not monotonic as a function of the eciency in
the intervention method. According to the model, it is possible to control
an outbreak with interventions based on the detection of symptoms only
in the case when the presence of just one symptom prompts isolation and
the detection eciency reaches about

80%

of the cases. Requesting two

symptoms to trigger intervention can be enough to fail in the goals.

Introduction

Ever since the emergence of COVID-19 [1], mathematical models have been
proposed to examine, illustrate and forecast the possible evolution of the pandemic, as well as recommending public measures for managing it.

Modelling

epidemics has to deal with a variety of diculties at dierent levels and the
present pandemic is not an exception.
This work adopts a stochastic approach following a line of thought developed over the last century [2, 3, 4, 5] that rests on counting populations in its
natural form and evolving their numbers at characteristic events. In relation to
them, ODE models represent the evolution of average fractions of populations
in a large-population limit [6, 7, 8, 9]

1 . In this respect, one of our aims is to ex-

plore, at least within the limited scope of the situation considered, the relevance
of stochasticity in our perception of the pandemic.
A good part of the literature has addressed the phenomena of asymptomatic
carriers of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

Unfortunately, the label

asymptomatic has been used with dierent meanings, going from 'not presenting the expected symptoms at the moment of infecting someone else', as in
[11, 13] to never, in the course of the infection, presenting symptoms [18]. In
all cases, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic are considered as objective categories pertaining to the relation between the infected person and the infectious
agent. The inuence of the actions of the public health system and the perception of illness by the patients in building these categories has not been properly
examined, thus preventing any improvement of these actions.
In previous modelling work either asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2
have not been considered or they have been incorporated using an ad-hoc hypothesis, such as that the ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases is
constant (see, e.g., [19]). In contrast, our model incorporates a detection component based in what it is known of detection policies. Another sharp dierence
with earlier work is that we model a variable contagiousness and not only a
variable contagious period. Furthermore, intrinsic stochasticity is included in
contrast with the extrinsic stochasticity (added a-posteriori

among the pre-existing papers.
In this work we will take a complex systems view. We begin by acknowledging that the COVID-19 epidemic is no longer a free-running epidemic but
rather one in which there is a strong interaction between the public health system and the population dynamics of the outbreaks. Changes in the evolution
of an outbreak trigger changes in the consideration of which characteristics of
the COVID-19 cases should (or should not) trigger public action.

This indi-

cates that there is a clear interaction between these systems and they cannot
be considered independent. To illustrate the point we will use the various criteria of COVID-19 case used in our home country (HGS), Argentina, following
recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO). We will produce
compartments that relate to the evolution of the case in medical or biological
terms as well as to the categories corresponding to the dierent protocols to be
applied to the case.
The response to an epidemic requires not only the mobilisation of public
resources but the participation of the public as well. To organize the actions
required for each individual case COVID-hot-lines and web-servers have been
organized world wide. Such help services indicate which measures to take by
those that suspect they are developing COVID-19, and prompt ocial actions if
needed. Hospitals and health centres, as well as help services, are coordinated in
their actions by protocols. A main tool of these protocols is the
criterion.

suspected-case

This criterion regulates state intervention and depends on clinical

symptoms of the (potential) patient and other circumstances.

The criterion

constitutes a dicult balance between the administration of resources (for example use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits and
laboratories), the developmental stage of the epidemic, the mortality risk of the
case and more.

As in any decision taken under real circumstances (limited

resources), establishing the suspected-case criterion implies trade-os.

When

diagnostic resources such as RT-PCR tests are limited, a conict emerges:
should we reserve them for individual diagnosis (for example, to conrm diagnostic by symptoms in cases of doubt or concern) or perhaps use them in epidemiological surveillance (triggering actions such as contact tracing or sample
pooling monitoring) as well? In any intermediate cases: in which proportions?
Should the general criterion depend on being a

contact

of a COVID-19 case?

Does it make sense to require weaker symptoms for the population which is aware
of having epidemiological contact with COVID-19 cases rather than for the

munitarian

com-

cases that cannot account for how they could have been infected?

Actually, it could make sense if by such measures we were able to achieve a
more ecient use of a scarce resource to be reserved for diagnosing related to
treatment (a private/individual criteria contrasting to public/epidemic criteria).
The question must be put: is it correct to focus our attention in travellers and
their contacts at the beginning of the outbreak? Is eciency really boosted by
requiring two relevant symptoms of a list for potentially communitarian cases
and only one to people with epidemiological contacts?

In the context of the

propagation of SARS-CoV-2, what are the consequences of such decisions? We
will address these questions implementing a model apt for answering them.

To set the grounds for our model, we analyse data collected by the Public
Health Ministry of Argentina, made available to us through the COVID-19 initiative under the Ministry of Science and Technology. The model incorporates
medical ndings regarding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as actions
taken by the health authorities and to a certain extent the social behaviour of
the population. We apply the model to small slums (variously called in SouthAmerica:

villas miseria, villas de emergencia, cantegril, favelas, etc.)

where the

conditions of homogeneous contact, frequently used to simplify the modelling
task, are closer to be fullled. We show how the model predicts epidemic circulation below the detection level for surprisingly long periods of time. Also, we
illustrate that average epidemics are not good representatives to grasp the dynamics, and that the undetected (mild, unrecognized, presymptomatic, asymptomatic) cases are in good proportion the result of public policies coupled to
the characteristics of the illness. The outcome of three forms of surveillance and
public action are comparatively analysed.
In Section 2 we describe the model, from its basis supported in both biology
and social behaviour all the way to the algorithm implementing a Markov Jump
process [3, 4]. Results are presented in Section 3 and discussed in the following
Section 4. Section 5 nally sums up the Conclusions.

the clinical presentation. This new item acknowledges the existence of the illness regardless of any presence in risk zones or close contact with probable or
conrmed cases.
Also the concept of
risk contacts

close contact

evolved during the period. By 31 January

7 considered only recent (within 14 days) travel or cohabitation

with a COVID-19 patient (apart from special considerations for sanitary operators). The concept evolved to that of close contact, becoming highly detailed in
what regards social distance (2m, 15 min) and hygiene already by 27 February
2020

8.

At the end of May, specic instructions for

contact tracing 9

(already opera-

tive, though) had been developed.
The criteria for identication of cases shifts focus along the pandemic. At
the beginning, the focus is in the virus import from other regions where it is
active, while the local diusion becomes relevant only some weeks/months later.
The trade-o in the identication generates classes of contagion depending on
the criterion.
Along with the case criteria, surveillance and control criteria are developed.
At the beginning of the pandemic,

passive surveillance

(i.e., to wait for the

spontaneous appearance of patients, except perhaps for travellers) was the most
common attitude.

Soon after, many countries developed dierent degrees of

contact-tracing (with varying success), even revealing preexistent aws in the
various national health and care systems.
In Appendix A we show the evolution of the criteria in Argentina and its
relation with Italy's case.
The decision of what to consider a

suspected case, and when further actions

are to be taken, is a critical one. However, it is not clear which is the overall
criteria, meta-criteria, adopted by Italy or Argentina, presumably upon recommendations of WHO. It appears that the meta-criterion is to keep an even
level of certainty of being a COVID-19 case for each individual case. It is then
pertinent to explore whether this goal is achieved or not and if such goal is
epidemiologically sound.

Viremia, symptoms and contagiousness

An important ingredient of any model concerning the evolution of the disease
requires the description of a contagion mechanism at the individual level. It is
important to relate when, how much and how long a person is in a contagious
condition to the evolution of the disease in the agent.
Upon contagion, the infected individual gradually develops larger and larger
levels of virus, in pace with the viral reproduction capabilities in the infected
patient.

Eventually, a maximum level is reached and the viremic load subse-

quently declines along with a recovery from infection.

This process may be

interrupted at any time because of complications, be them virus-based or any
other.

12 Report of symptoms is not an obligation for the sanitary units.

We assume therefore that the viremic load is the biological origin of both
the severity of illness for an average infected individual and the capability to
transmit the virus. In simpler words, the quantity of virus in each individual
regulates how ill she/he is and with which eciency the infection can be passed
along.
Symptoms, severity and contagiousness are dierent from person to person,
but they follow an approximate sequence from zero up to a maximum value,
subsequently decaying towards zero again.

From the day of clear symptom

onset we adopt a model for the viremic load, based in early ndings [18, 21]
from the initial period of the pandemic where individual cases could be traced
in detail. We model the viremia from days 5 to 10 using a gamma distribution.
The

presymptomatic period

(a period usually of weak symptoms) is modelled

in three stages, a rst non contagious compartment lasting a day in average,
followed by a low contagion compartment, lasting about two days, with the
same viremic level than the last day of contagion and nally followed by a
compartment with higher contagiousness lasting also about two days.

by a stage with higher viremic levels but still no detection symptoms.

The duration and distribution of the presymptomatic days, from contagion
to symptoms, described in this form is supported by the distribution of times
between the appearance of earlier symptoms and the day of diagnostic for the
data collected in Argentina (see Figure 2). In fact, the observed mean for the

slightly less than ve days before the onset of recognized symptoms and the
decision of swabbing.
After the presymptomatic period, symptoms usually appear clearly until
they gradually decline. We assume the symptomatic compartments to last in
average one day each, with viremic levels as in the nal part of Fig. 1.
For the sake of dealing with a pandemic, symptoms in themselves are only
an ingredient. They facilitate the possibility of detecting infected patients, especially when the pandemic constrains the sanitary authorities to keep a passive
attitude. In any case, the appearance of symptoms on each individual depends
not only on the viremic load but also on the individual condition of each patient.

ponent. The biological component was discussed above: We assume both the
probability of detection and the probability of contagion to be proportional to
the viremic levels of infected individuals, modelled according to Figures 1 and
2. This assumption rest partly on the observations in [18, 21]. However, recent
work ([22], appeared after this submission) suggests that there are other mechanisms operating as well, depending on the patient's response to the infection
and deserving a deeper analysis. The modelling prole is summarized in Table
2. The social component reects the ability of the sanitary authorities to enforce
measures in order to (a) detect infected individuals and reduce the chances of
contagion (by isolation, hospitalisation, etc.) and (b) eectively inuence social
behaviour, aiming to reduce the chances that infected, undetected individuals
may transmit the disease.

2.1.3

About slums

Slum areas have a very specic social structure.

They have high population

density and intense poverty, resulting in homes shared by several generations
(sometimes with just one bedroom), larger number of homeless people in comparison to the rest of city, precarious services (water, electricity, sewage, . . . ),
as well as strong internal ties and social organizations such as community run
food assistance and other internal solidarity networks. Stay at home policies
cannot be sustained, to the point that sometimes the whole slum area has been
locked allowing for its internal life to continue undisturbed. The contact structure for individuals in slums is more homogeneous and with larger contact rate
than the surrounding cities.

2.1.4

The detection of cases as a function of the surveillance protocol

The decision of admitting a case as a probable case of COVID-19 depends not
only on the biological/health condition of the case (i.e., the viremic level, presence of symptoms, etc.) but also on the expectations of the health services, HS,
as we have discussed in Section 2.1.1 and Appendix A. Since the chances for a
contagious person to produce new cases depends on a-priori expectations, the
expectations change the removal rate of contagious people (e.g., by isolating the
person). Furthermore, the condition of being suspected a-priori is mostly hereditary. The suspicion increases the probability of detection and the detection of a
case makes those infected by the case more likely to be detected. Let us call

T,

traceable, those with larger probabilities of detection a-priori, and U,untraceable,
those with smaller probabilities of detection. Let us further consider the limit
situation where all

T

are traced and detected with certainty and no

U

is ever

detected. Such an idealized, limit situation will result in two independent epidemics, for no

No real situation is expected to reach this limit case, hence, in a

U cases are detected with lesser probability and later
T may escape tracing and detection when still conta-

gious. The inheritance of the tracing classes is then imperfect and there is only
one, mixed-type, epidemic. We represent this situation by a probability table

Mathematical/Computational support

The general approach is based on a Markov-jump process following the setup
of the Feller-Kendall [3, 4] algorithm.

The compartments

Xi , i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , N

involved in the process are the dierent classes of individuals taken into account
(to be described below) and the stochastic dynamics evolves by expressing the
number of individuals on each compartment as a function of time. Transitions
between compartments are given by Markov jumps triggered by dierent
and characterized by an event probability rate

events

WÎ± (X), Î± = 1, Â· Â· Â· , E .

relation between events, compartments (populations) and stochastic dynamics

The stochastic dynamics proceeds by establishing the behaviour of

General properties of Markov jump processes are assumed to hold for this
problem, in particular that events are independent of each other (although related indirectly by the dependence of the rates on the populations).

These

properties add up to the following two results [3, 23, 24, 25]:

The data usually discussed in the news and websites is the number of conrmed COVID-19 cases. In the present model this data is represented by the

the number of susceptible individuals.

The outcome of the model is presented by computing a few realisations
(typically

of the Feller-Kendall algorithm. No matter how parameters are

chosen, there exists a non-zero probability of early disease extinction (as it is in
any Markov jump process), particularly when the onset of the epidemics contains
very few infected individuals (1 or

on a population of a few thousands). The

model allows for ruling out early extinctions, considering that the epidemics that
are tracked, and concern us, are those that avoid early extinction and come to
be noticeable.
The actual evolution of the pandemic is intrinsically stochastic. Borrowing
from the modelling language, there is only one realisation of the real process,
namely the one we are currently experiencing.

There is no second run, al-

though many weakly coupled contagion chains may be running simultaneously
within e.g., a larger city.
With this in mind, we stress that the averaging of realisations is not a substitute for the real process. It has a limited value, in that it highlights features
that are recurrent, while it smears out what is less frequent. Moreover, no realisation of the stochastic process is more true than any other.

Predictions

based only on the averaging of realisations may serve as a clue about what to

2.3.2

Contagion, removal and HS policies

We consider in detail the mechanisms of contagion and removal, as well as their
relation with both the evolution of the disease in the infective individual and
the HS policies.
Contagion within the system is taken to be strictly proportional to the
viremic levels

V (k).

The proportionality constants

Î²T, Î²U

may vary accord-

ing to social strategies and attitudes.
The eventual removal of an infected individual in the model is governed by
the competition between two mutually exclusive events. Either the individuals
evolve to the next stage in the viremic levels (i.e., they are still infected and
capable of contagion) or they are removed from the contagion chain for whatever

it is worth to indicate that the growth exponent of infected cases and that of
detected cases is not the same, being the latter smaller than the former, specially
in less eective regimes as

H

and

F +.

As a consequence, basic reproductive

numbers inferred from the early development of the pandemic that had assumed
that detected cases are roughly proportional to the actual cases underestimate
the growth rate.

See Figure 5.

Note that the gap between growth rates is

larger for the lower detection eort as compared with the higher (red/green vs
blue/magenta pairs).

3.2.3

Undetected/detected ratios

The ratio between total cases and detected cases of COVID-19 has been the
subject of several works. In particular Malani et al. [28] and MuÃ±oz et al. [29]
address the situation in slums, reporting ratios of

10 : 1

[28] and

5:1

[29]

15 .

The latter study was performed at least one month after most cases occurred,
although with the outbreak still running. The majority of the registered cases
had occurred before 6 June, when the tracking method in use was of type

F +.

After 6 June, the tracking sharpened to any two symptoms, a medium form
of

I.

We show averaged ratios in Figure 6 but it is worth to keep in mind

that there are usually large uctuations present. The gure shows that in all
situations there is a tendency to a sharp increment of the ratio at the beginning
of the outbreak followed by a maximum level and subsequently a monotonic
decrement.

15 The accuracy of serological tests used to evaluate a-posteriori the prevalence of COVID-19
can be questioned based on works that indicate that not all people presenting immunological
reactions to the virus develop humoral antibodies [30, 31, 22]

3.2.4

Dynamical mechanisms

The most remarkable features present in the simulations are the diverse forms in
which the stochasticity and the particularities of the contagious process manifest
globally.

Despite being seeded with two traceable cases, it is not uncommon

(probability larger than

0.01)

to observe the outbreak to remain with sporadic

cases up to 50 days and only then the recognisable bell-shaped of the daily
cases begins. We show one of such cases in Figure 7, left panel. In the centre
panel we show a two waves outbreak under policy

IH

and a dierent shape of

two waves with a long delay between them is shown in the right panel. The
dierence among realisations suggests that stochastic epidemic outbreaks are
not just an average outbreak plus noise.
As expected, the epidemic size depends strongly on the policy applied. It is
interesting to show the transition of the probability distribution as a function of
the intensity of the control measures. In Figure 8 we show histograms after 100
simulations for the total number of infections in a population of 5000 individuals.
While extinctions of the epidemic with a low number of cases are always possible,
they are infrequent in the Low intensity case, they begin to be noticeable in
the Medium intensity and are dominant in the High intensity situation. This
transition is known as the stochastic equivalent of the transition in deterministic
equations when the basic reproductive number moves from above one to below
one and has been discussed elsewhere [32, 33, 34].
The number of

detected cases, i.e., people diagnosed as infected with SARS-

CoV-2, depend in no trivial form of the detection policy and intensity.

We

show in Figure 9 that the relation is not monotonic. In general, an increase in

the number of cases detected (policies

but also in an increase (H ).

In fact, the design of the model only assures that the

probability

of detection

increases with increasing intensity. If the total number of cases is low, the total
number of detected cases will also be low, despite a higher detection probability.
We can see as well that the eorts made with a passive policy (H ) produce only
little changes in the development of the epidemic.

Discussion

In the present model biological aspects are intertwined with sanitary policies.
These policies are not considered in terms of their desired eects translated as
eective parameters of an otherwise free running epidemic but rather mechanistically, changing not only parameter values but the structure of the model
as well. By doing so, we allow policies to manifest not only what they were intended for, but also unexpected features. The same can be said with respect to
the coupling between intrinsic randomness and dynamics which results not only
in the expected daily uctuations of the outbreak but presents low-frequency
uctuations as well. These low-frequency uctuations account, by themselves,
for the possibility of silent circulation of the virus for prolonged intervals of
time as well as for the awakening of extinguished outbreaks due to contagion
outside the simulated community.

The eective coupling of control measures

and intrinsic randomness represents an additional diculty for any attempt at
predicting the evolution of a single/particular epidemic outbreak.
Although it should be clear from the setup adopted in this work, it is worth
recalling that all realisations of a stochastic model are on an equal footing. Any
of them respond to the process in its own right.

A strength of the present

approach is the capability of displaying a variety of possible epidemic outcomes.
Indeed, Figure 4, Right and 7 show that dramatic dierences in epidemic size (for
the same stochastic process), second waves and late development of outbreaks
are not unlikely to occur.
Figures 5 and 6 show that the ratio of undetected to detected cases is not
constant in the course of an epidemic and even worse, the growth rate of undetected cases is larger than that of detected cases. Hence, epidemic size is likely
to be underestimated when computed through recorded cases. Finally, Figure
8 illustrates how the stochastic outcomes can be translated into probabilities of
e.g., having a given epidemic size.
One important goal of this work is to assist in the issue of resource allocation
when dealing with a pandemic. HSs throughout the world dier in equipment,
logistic capabilities, exibility, etc., depending on the preexisting policies and
infrastructure. The working conditions dier even locally within the same city,
as discussed above. Where should resources go? Will low-cost (and lower eciency) strategies under a longer period of time be preferred to high-cost (and
higher eciency) strategies with a shorter time-span?
In our model we mimic the HS decisions by considering two groups of individuals: Those that are early identied and recognized as potential patients,

T,

and the rest,

U,

of which the HS is initially unaware. We do not deal with

nancial costs, but we can compare highly-eective and less eective strategies
throughout time.

Preventive intervention strategies accrue costs in terms of

isolating contagious people and testing.

The kind of intervention considered

in the present work is based upon tracking oligosymptomatic people but not
searching for completely asymptomatic cases, thus a good indicator of costs is
the total number of cases detected. The best strategy of all those considered
in this respect is the

I

strategy with an ecient,

H,

search method, which is

able to inhibit the development of outbreaks. The strategy has fewer detected
cases and smallest overall size ( see Fig. 8, right panel and Figure 10, upper left
panel).
We compare two distributions of detected cases for equal eciency of detection, see Figure 10. The comparatively few detected in the
constitute most of the outbreak, while
cases.

A short side of the

I

panel of Figure 10

adds a larger number of undetected

policy is that the eective suocation of an epi-

demic outbreak in slum areas cannot by itself prevent recurrent late outbreaks
triggered by external contagion (see Figure 11). Hence, the alert state of the
HS will have to be maintained for longer times.

However, the advantages of

strategy under a medium or low detection success, thus having a higher

failure rate in avoiding outbreaks, is not so considerable. As it can be seen in
the gure, combining a suboptimal policy with a suboptimal tracking (F

lower right panel) is expected to be more cost eective than an optimal policy

with suboptimal tracking (IM , lower left panel) in terms of detection, although
the overall size of the epidemic is expected to be lower in the

I

situation, while

the necessary social eort is larger.
Despite our simulations have been seeded in all cases with two infected people
and only epidemic outbreaks that do not get extinguished for 19 days have been
considered, some runs do not develop an outbreak and some others produce
an outbreak only because of external contagion (from outside of the simulated
neighbourhood), an eect than can occur in a completely dierent time scale as
is shown in 11
Also, we illustrate that the average epidemic is not enough to grasp the relevant diversity of possible scenarios of real (unique) outbreak dynamics, and that
the undetected (mild, unrecognized, presymptomatic, asymptomatic) cases are
in good proportion the result of public policies coupled to the characteristics of
the illness.
Limitations: As mentioned previously, one of the assumptions of the present

model is the homogeneity of contacts through the population. For that reason,
it only makes full sense when applied to small communities. The proper path to
surpass this constraint is to raise the level of detail, identifying subpopulations
with some common property (e.g., age segregation, mobility, local connement,
etc.) that are in weakly mutual interaction. This is a costly approach from the
point of view of experimental design, since each new level of detail demands a
detailed understanding of the specic interactions.

Some eort in this direc-

tion has been to identify superspreaders, a possibility that recently became

Conclusions

The modelling goal of this work was to conceive mechanisms for the interplay of the epidemic disease and the adopted social measures.

The epidemic

is not just biologically given in terms of e.g., a basic reproductive number or
a herd-immunity level that are taken to be virus-specic and independent of
social organisation. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a free running epidemic or
one addressed with pre-established measures, but rather one where dynamically
evolving interventions are the rule. The way in which interventions change the
dynamics and the observations (monitoring) of the epidemic must be considered.
All too often the analysis of the epidemic by the political components of the
HS's, in practice consider a biologically given epidemic, and interventions that
aect its evolution only in the way they were intended. This reasoning leads to
false alternatives between herd immunity, vaccines and connement, with the
hidden assumption that social behaviour cannot (or must not) be modied. On
the contrary, this work suggests that what we (collectively) do inuences the
level of risk to which we are exposed.

Social behaviour can modify epidemic

outcomes [36].
We observe that an increment in the number of daily detected cases does not
necessarily imply an improvement on how the epidemic is being managed, nor
a worsening of the outbreak. Case-detection cannot be understood separately
from the HS policy. Lower detection may be an indicator of success in the proper
context. Hence, to translate the statistics for one country to another country is
far from straightforward. More locally, the transfer of information from detected
(registered) cases to estimated number of cases from seroprevalence studies is
not independent of the adopted HS policy and depends as well of the timing
with respect to the development of the outbreak.
Randomness plays a substantial role in COVID-19 dynamics, a role that
departs from the signal+noise analysis framework. Low frequency, or coherent
uctuations, are relevant at the level of outbreaks in slums and there is no reason

to believe the same is not going to be true in larger, heterogeneous, settings. The
immediate consequence is that averaging and uncontrolled approximations to
the average outbreak will be aligned with intuitions but could be misaligned with
a reality displaying a largely unpredictable form. The stochastic behaviour is
aected as well by the social management of the epidemic, coupling two usually
neglected contributions and making prediction of outcomes even more dicult.
The intervention of health authorities had been from below in most countries.

By from below we mean a sequence of interventions going from non-

intervention and passing through increasing levels of action until reaching lock
downs in desperation.

Such an approximation has to be revised, it is an ap-

proach that privileges something dierent than people's health.

If our model

is correct, it is possible to control the outbreaks with interventions that target mostly the symptomatic population.

Such a method will have to target

for isolation of any one presenting a single symptom of those compatible with
COVID-19. The cost of more certainties is to lose control of the outbreak, being forced to apply lock downs, thus immobilising the productive forces of the
healthy people rather than the comparatively small group that is potentially
infected by SARS-CoV-2.
The decision of requiring more symptoms to declare a case as COVID-19
suspect whenever the patient has no identied contact with conrmed cases
facilitates the circulation of the virus even when a highly ecient detection
protocol is used.
Asymptomatic cases quite often are undetected cases as well, but the reverse
is not true. Classifying or referring to undetected patients as asymptomatic can
be viewed as an ethical matter. The term asymptomatic puts the blame on
the virus and helps to dispense social failures. In contrast, undetected places
the burden on society and should help to x attention in what we can do better.
Thus, if we are forced to err because of incomplete information the way we err
must be ethically considered.

Criteria of suspicious case in Argentina

The early evolution of the criteria (we omit the specications for sanitary operators) for a case to be suspicious in Argentina is as follows (we indicate correspondence with Italy's resolutions):
29 February 2020 (Corresponds to Italy's January resolution)
There are two ways to be considered a suspected case:

1. The person has fever and signs of respiratory infection (cough, diculty in
breathing) and a requirement for hospitalisation
and no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation and a
history of travel or residence in mainland China in the 14 days prior to the
onset of symptoms.
2. The person has fever and signs of respiratory infection (cough,
odynophagia, diculty in breathing) and either
a history of travel or residence in the province of Hubei (China) in the 14 days
prior to the onset of symptoms
or known close contact with a probable or conrmed case of COVID-19
infection, in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms
or exposure in a health centre in a country where conrmed cases of
COVID-19 have been attended, in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms
or visited or worked in a live animal market in any city in China.

5 March 2020 (Corresponds to Italy's late February resolutions)
The person has fever and one or more respiratory symptoms (cough, diculty
in breathing, odynophagia) without another aetiology that fully explains the
clinical presentation, and that in the last 14 days either has been in contact
with conrmed or probable COVID-19 cases or has a history of travel or
presence in areas with local transmission of SARS CoV-2

16 March 2020 (Corresponds approximately to Italy's 9 March resolution) In
addition to the previous situation, a new suspected case begins to be
considered: Any person with severe acute respiratory disease who requires
mechanical ventilation due to their respiratory symptoms, without other
aetiology that explains it, even without epidemiological link.

21 March 2020
Travel history to specic countries is substituted by travel abroad.
Specications are given for severe acute respiratory disease, dened as
pneumonia and one of the following:
Respiratory rate:> 30 / min,
Sat O2 <93% (ambient air),
Mechanical assistance requirement,
Increase in inltrates> 50% in 24-48 hours,
Altered consciousness,
CURB-65â‰¥ 2 points,
Unit of Intensive Therapy requirement,
and without another aetiology that explains the clinical picture.

The issue of travel or residence in areas of local transmission (either
community or by conglomerates) of COVID-19 in Argentina is added.
In the case of pneumonia, the other conditions raised on 21 March are no
longer required.

8 April 2020
Cases added:
Health workers presenting fever and and one symptom among (cough,
odynophagia or diculty in breathing)

16 April 2020
To the requirements raised on 5 March, in the case of symptoms that could
accompany fever, the following is added: anosmia/dysgeusia.

13 May 2020
Anyone presenting fever (37.5ÂºC or more) and one or more of (cough,
odynophagia, diculty in breathing, anosmia, dysgeusia) of recent
presentation, without another clinical explanation AND precedents of
travelling to (or residence in) places with viral circulation or contact with
conrmed cases of COVID-19
Anyone presenting anosmia/dysgeusia is to be observed by 72hs and then
tested.
Health workers with two or more of the described symptoms.
6 June 2020
Anyone presenting two or more of (fever -37.5ÂºC or more-, cough,
odynophagia, diculty in breathing, anosmia, dysgeusia) AND (having being
present in a zone with viral circulation OR residing in a popular
neighbourhood -slum-) OR requiring hospitalization)
Health workers and any with close contact with a COVID-19 case presenting
ate least one symptom.

4 August 2020
Three symptoms added to the set: headache and vomits and diarrhoea.

11 September 2020
Added symptom: myalgia
Anyone presenting fever (37.5ÂºC or more) and one or more of (cough,
odynophagia, diculty in breathing, anosmia, dysgeusia) of recent
presentation, without another clinical explanation.
Anyone presenting anosmia/dysgeusia.
For health workers and inhabitants of popular neighbourhoods the requisite
is of one symptom.
