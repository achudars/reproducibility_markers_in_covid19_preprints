Abstract
Testing and case identification are key strategies in controlling the COVID-19

3

pandemic. Contact tracing and isolation are only possible if cases have been identified. The

4

effectiveness of testing must be tracked, but a single comprehensive metric is not available to

5

assess testing effectiveness, and no timely estimates of case detection rate are available

6

globally, making inter-country comparisons difficult. The purpose of this paper was to

7

propose a single, comprehensive metric, called the COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) scaled

8

from 0 to 100, that incorporated several testing metrics. The index was based on case-fatality

9

rate, test positivity rate, active cases, and an estimate of the detection rate. It used

10

parsimonious modeling to estimate the true total number of COVID-19 cases based on deaths,

11

testing, health system capacity, and government transparency. Publicly reported data from

12

188 countries and territories were included in the index. Estimates of detection rates aligned

13

with previous estimates in literature (R2=0.97). As of June 3, 2020, the states with the highest

14

CovTI included Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Thailand, and some island

15

nations. Globally, CovTI increased from April 20 (x̄=43.2) to June 3 (x̄=52.2) but declined in

16

ca. 10% of countries. Bivariate analyses showed the average in countries with open public

17

testing policies (59.7, 95% CI 55.6-63.8) were significantly higher than countries with no

18

testing policy (30.2, 95% CI 18.1-42.3) (p<0.0001). A multiple linear regression model

19

assessed the association of independent grouping variables with CovTI. Open public testing

20

and extensive contact tracing were shown to significantly increase CovTI, after adjusting for

21

extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and centralized forms of government. This

22

tool may be useful for policymakers to assess testing effectiveness, inform decisions, and

23

identify model countries. It may also serve as a tool for researchers in analyses by combining

24

it with other databases.

Introduction

2

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection of the Severe Acute

3

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many

4

countries, states, and territories to enact public health measures to reduce its spread, including social

5

distancing, contact tracing, stay-at-home orders, shuttering of schools, closure of public spaces, and

6

border closures [1,2].

7

Testing, case identification, and isolation are critical activities to breaking the transmission

8

chain [3]. Other measures, including social distancing and use of face masks, are also needed [4]. In

9

order to assess testing and inform decisions about resuming economic activities, many countries

10

and institutions have tracked testing-related metrics.

11

Thus far, the approach of many countries has generally been to specify several separate

12

metrics related to testing, such as incidence, test positivity rate, number of hospitalizations, and

13

mortality rate, with benchmarks for each criteria that are used to justify removing measures in

14

phases [5,6]. However, many of these metrics rely on cases that have been identified through active

15

diagnostic testing. One challenge, though, is the substantial proportion of the infected population

16

that is asymptomatic [7,8]. Consequently, diagnostic testing has been inadequate to reveal what

17

proportion of the population is infected, with real infections in most countries estimated to be 10 to

18

15 times, and sometimes even >100 times, higher than the reported number of cases [9–11].

19

Furthermore, predicating reopening dates on incidence may disincentivize testing, since increased

20

diagnostic testing will inherently uncover more cases and, thus, delay reopening. Another criticism

21

is that some criteria, such as the “downward trajectory,” specified by the US Centers for Disease

22

Control [5], are vague. Thus, metrics used by policymakers and politicians to inform decisions

23

should not only be quantitative but also encourage widespread proactive testing, such as the

24

proportion of the total number of infections that have been detected [12]. However, estimating the

25

detection rate/underreporting is challenging.

1

The level of undetected cases has been estimated with models using transmission

2

simulations and flight data [13,14]. Generally, these approaches require location-specific inputs,

3

limiting scalability and transferability. Alternatively, deaths seem to be a good indicator of true

4

number of COVID-19 infections in the population [15]. Deaths have been used in past pandemics to

5

estimate the true size of the pandemic given limited case identification [16]. The infection-fatality

6

rate (IFR) of COVID-19 based on serological testing and comprehensive diagnostic testing has been

7

shown to be between 0.7% and 1% [17–20], indicating that approximately 100 infections have

8

occurred to each death. However, factors such as health system capacity, demography, and political

9

regime impact the IFR [21]. Furthermore, heterogeneity in definitions of COVID-19-related deaths

10

and testing strategies cause differences in completeness of the death count [22]. Thus, if deaths are

11

used as an indicator of the true number of infections, adjustments may be necessary for testing,

12

health system capacity, and government transparency.

13

A single, comprehensive metric that is scalable across all countries and territories would

14

allow comparisons across states and identify ones most successful in more completely detecting the

15

presence of infections in the population. It would also allow for statistical techniques, such as

16

multiple linear regression, so researchers could comprehensively assess policy decisions in

17

combination with other databases. Comprehensive metrics for COVID-19 and inter-country

18

comparisons have been developed [23–25], but none that focus exclusively on testing or explicitly

19

incorporate the true number of infections or detection rate, to the best of the authors’ knowledge.

20

Thus, there is still a need for a single comprehensive metric that can overcome shortcomings in

21

reported data to assess testing effectiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

22

Therefore, a single comprehensive metric that assesses testing effectiveness by

23

incorporating an estimate of the true total number of COVID-19 infections in the population was

24

developed using publicly reported data universally accessible across nearly all countries and

25

territories. Model estimates of true period prevalence and detection rate were validated against

26

comparable estimates in the literature. The metric was then used to assess factors associated with

comprehensively assess COVID-19 testing outcomes and identify effective policies.

Methods and materials

Data input

5

Data on COVID-19 were collected from the Worldometer website, which collects data

6

directly from government communication channels and is managed by an international team of

7

developers, researchers, and volunteers [26]. The data collected from Worldometer included total

8

cases (C), total deaths (D), total recovered (R), active cases (A), population (P) (in millions), and

9

total tests (T). These data have been reported explicitly or implicitly by the website since at least

10
11

April 6, 2020. Prior to this date, subsets of these data were available.
Two other input data included the Global Health Security Index Detection and Reporting

12

sub-index (Isys) [27] and the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index (Idem) [28]. The Isys

13

assesses a health system’s capacity for early detection and reporting during epidemics of potential

14

international concern. This index is available for 195 countries and has a scale from 0 to 100, where

15

100 indicates perfect detection and reporting. Isys values were not available for Hong Kong and

16

Taiwan. The value for Hong Kong, Isys=78, was imputed as the average between South Korea

17

(Isys=92.1) and Singapore (Isys=64.5), which were assumed to have comparable health systems.

18

Similarly, the value for Taiwan, Isys=81, was imputed as average between South Korea (Isys=92.1)

19

and Japan (Isys=70.1). All other states without a value (n=17) were imputed as 42, which was the

20

global average. Idem is a projected measure of the degree of democracy; it is calculated for 167

21

countries and states and has a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates the highest degree of

22

democracy. This value was assumed to act as a proxy for transparency in data reporting. All states

23

without a value (n=24) were imputed to be 5.4, the global average.

Definition of key indicators
Several key indicators were computed from the input data, representing important
epidemiological indicators used in the analysis.

8
9
10

Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
The CFR is the proportion of total deaths, D, among closed cases (sum of D and R).

11

However, some countries, including the Netherlands and United Kingdom, have not reported the

12

number of recoveries, and others have not tracked recoveries in real-time. Additionally, the closed-

13

case definition of CFR can overestimate the CFR in the early stages of an epidemic because of the

14

relatively small number of closed cases [29]. Therefore, an alternative estimate of CFR was

15

calculated as the ratio of deaths, D, to cases, C. Logically, the ratio of D:C is lower than D:(D+R)

16

because C includes unresolved cases with unknown outcomes. Linear regression of these two ratios

17

using data from the Worldometer [26] showed the relationship to be: D:(D+R) = 1.99*(D:C)

18

(R2=0.58, n=178). Thus, the CFR used in our further analysis was the minimum of either the

19

reported closed-case CFR or 2 times the ratio of D:C (Eq. 1).

While the reported number of tests from specific countries or territories may represent multiple tests

4

conducted on a single individual or even number of specimens, no adjustment was attempted to

5

account for such heterogeneity in the various definitions of the TPR. In some cases, T was not

6

available and thus TPR was not calculated.

Tests per Capita (TPC)

Similar to TPR, no adjustments were made to account for inter-country heterogeneity in

Estimating true number of infections and detection rate
It can be assumed that the reported number of cases, C, in a country represents a subset of

18

the true number of infections. Some infections will go undetected, but as detection of cases

19

increases, C will approach the true number of infections. Thus, the true number of infections (Inf) is

20

some factor, f, higher than the cases that have been identified (Eq. 4).

We conceptualized this factor, f, to be a function of the level of testing, the approach to

quality and completeness of the data. We then used the CFR, TPR, TPC, Isys, and Idem to formulate

2

numerical values for f. Two separate formulations of f (f1 and f2) were defined, and the maximum of

3

each of the two factors was used in the following analysis, as described below.

4
5
6

Factor 1 (f1)
Health system capacity and government transparency affect the completeness of data. To

7

account for this, two multipliers were constructed: msys (Eq. 5) to adjust for the health system

8

capacity using Isys—an indicator of a health system’s ability to detect and report cases; and mdem

9

(Eq. 6) to adjust for government transparency using Idem—an indicator of government transparency

10

in reporting data.

(6)

14
15

The mathematical relationships between the index and the multiplier in each of these

16

equations follow declining relationships asymptotic to 1 and the principle that when health system

17

capacity (Isys) or government transparency (Idem) are reduced, the multipliers increase, representing

18

increased underreporting.

19

Additionally, another indicator of underreporting is a high ratio of deaths to cases, D:C. If

20

all infections have been identified as cases and all cases resolve, then this ratio will approach the

21

infection fatality rate (IFR), which has been estimated for COVID-19 to be around 1% or less [17].

22

That is, for every recorded death, at least 100 infections occurred. Thus, if the ratio of 100D:C

23

exceeded 1, it was used together with msys and mdem to determine f1, otherwise 1 was used and f1

24

was determined by the product of msys and mdem only (Eq. 7).

Factor 2 (f2)
Inadequate or low testing levels may also affect the completeness of the data. Therefore, a

5

second factor incorporated data on testing (Eq. 8). This factor was comprised of two multipliers:

6

mTPR (Eq. 9) based on TPR—an indicator of adequate testing relative to disease prevalence—and

7

mTPC (Eq. 10) based on TPC—an indicator of adequate testing relative to the population.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested testing capacity is adequate when

12

TPR is <10% [30]. If TPR is greater than 10%, it was inferred that increasingly more cases were

13

undetected and that the multiplier mTPR would be equal to the ratio of the TPR to that 10%

14

benchmark (Eq. 9).

It was further assumed that if TPC was greater than 100,000 per million, or 10% of the entire

18

population, TPC was extensive enough not to contribute to underreporting (i.e., mTPC = 1).

19

Logically, as TPC decreases, the likelihood of undetected infections increases. The assumed

20

relationship between the multiplier mTPC and TPC followed a step-wise logarithmic relationship

(Eq. 10).

The true number of infections, Inf, was estimated as the product of C and the maximum of
the two factors, whichever was highest (Eq. 11).

When possible, Inf was compared against national estimates from other empirical estimates

Detection Rate (DR)
With an estimate of the true number of infections, it was possible to estimate what

14

percentage of the infections (including asymptomatic) have been detected. The total number of

15

cases, C, was divided by Inf to estimate the DR in each country or territory. The inverse of the

16

factor, 1/f, represents the DR. Estimates of the DR were compared to DRs published in the

literature.

Calculation of the COVID-19 Testing Index
The COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) consists of four sub-indices, each based on a single

21

key indicator. The key indicators used were the DR, TPR, CFR, and proportion of cases that are

22

active (i.e., A/C). These indicators were chosen since they are commonly used as metrics and are

computable with the methods described above. The relationship between each sub-index and its

2

indicator was built on two principles. First, each sub-index was scaled from 0 to 100 with 0

3

representing the worst indicator value and 100 the best indicator value. Second, a square root

4

mathematical relationship was used to scale the sub-index. A square root function was chosen as a

5

simplistic way to reflect the complex reality, in which each marginal change of an indicator in the

6

undesired direction (e.g., increase in TPR or decrease in DR) represents an increasingly higher risk

7

of an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic or a worse testing response. These sub-indices were

8

combined in a weighted average to compute CovTI.

9
10

Detection Rate sub-index (DRsi)

11

If infections are undiagnosed, those individuals can actively spread the disease unknowingly.

12

Without timely diagnosis, effective contact tracing cannot occur. Therefore, undiagnosed infections

13

critically contribute to unchecked spread of COVID-19 and subsequently represent inadequate

14

response. Thus, DRsi was given 40% weighting in computing the CovTI (Eq. 16). As the detection

15

rate decreases, the DRsi decreases (Eq. 12).

(12)

18
19

Test Positivity sub-index (TPsi)

20

The TPR is a commonly used testing metric for COVID-19 [31]. A high TPR represents a

21

reactive, rather than proactive, approach to testing. Accordingly, as TPR increases, the TP si decreases

22

(Eq. 13). If TPR was not available, a dummy value of 20 was used. TPsi was given 20% weighting in

computing the CovTI.

Case-Fatality sub-index (CFsi)

The WHO has suggested that the CFR should be around 1 to 2 percent if the response is

adequate. If CFR is higher, only severely infected patients are being diagnosed. Accordingly, if CFR

4

increases beyond the minimum benchmark of 2%, CFsi decreases (Eq. 13). If the CFR is less than

5

2%, the CFsi is 100. CFsi was given 20% weighting. If the CFR was 0%, a dummy value of 50 was

Active Case sub-index (ACsi)

11

Finally, a fourth sub-index accounts for how active the epidemic is in a country. If the

epidemic is relatively active in the country, it is less likely the testing is adequate, and the increase

13

reflects inadequate case identification. It provides a metric to incorporate progress as cases resolve.

The CovTI was calculated as the weighted average of the four sub-indices (Eq. 16) described

12

May 13, 2020, which is three weeks prior to June 3, 2020, approximately the average time from

(co-island), or has limited land connections (limited land) or archipelago (see details in S1 Table).

15

Crude bivariate analyses using two-tailed two-sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance

16

(ANOVA) were used to test whether the means between groups were different. A multiple linear

17

regression (MLR) model was developed by using forced entry of all factors with p>0.20 in crude

18

analysis. Factors were removed using backwards stepwise method (p >0.05) with Bayesian

19

Information Criterion (BIC) used to assess model fit and overparameterization. Analyses were

20

performed in Stata 14 [33].

True number of infections

OECD = Organization for Economic Development

Globally, the model estimated that approximately 68.2 million people have been infected in

5

the period prior to June 3, 2020, compared to the reported 6.47 million cases (mean multiplier

6

factor, f, =10.5, range = 1.5 to 165). In other words, for every reported case it is estimated that 9.5

7

infections have gone unreported.

Detection rate

10

Globally, the DR was estimated to be 9.5% (range = 0.6-66.6%). The countries estimated to

11

have the highest detection rates were Australia, Singapore, Iceland, and Hong Kong (Table 2), each

12

estimated to have detected at least 50% of all infections.

Temporal Comparison
Comparing the index from April 20 to June 3, the global average of CovTI increased nearly

4

10 points from 43.2 to 52.2 (Fig 2). The index in most countries (89.9%) increased over this time

5

period. Some countries, such as Australia, increased substantially, while other countries, such as

6

Germany and USA, increased comparably to the global average increase. Other countries (10.1%)

7

had index values that decreased, including Russia, Canada, and Brazil.

15

associated (p<0.0001) with CovTI (Table 5). Additionally, the trend demonstrated that increasing

Discussion

3

We developed a novel comprehensive metric, entitled the CovTI, that attempts to measure

4

effectiveness of testing during the COVID-19 pandemic at the country level and is derived from key

5

epidemiological indicators computable from data available across nearly all countries, as reported

6

on the Worldometer website and other similar databases [26]. Previous research has assessed

7

government response [23] and suggested specific indicators to facilitate inter-country comparisons

8

[24]. However, this is the first published metric to comprehensively assess testing outcomes with a

9

focus on detection/underreporting. The results showed that testing and contact tracing

10

independently contribute to better detection and should be used in conjunction with one another.

11

The results showed that the parsimonious model yielded estimates of true period prevalence

12

consistent with previous estimates as shown below.

13
14
15
16

National testing policy impact on testing outcomes
Testing effectiveness, as indicated by CovTI, was strongly associated with contact tracing
and testing policies. This validates the model’s ability to track COVID-19 testing outcomes and

1

further provides confirmation that countries that prioritize policies and dedicate resources

2

specifically to testing and contact tracing have effectively reduced underreporting and improved

3

testing-related health outcome metrics, such as the CFR.

4

The results also show that increasingly more inclusive policies for testing (for example,

5

open public testing vs. symptomatic testing) and contact tracing (e.g., extensive vs. limited) yielded

6

progressively better detection rates and testing outcomes. Therefore, countries should aim to

7

increasingly expand these efforts. Additionally, contact tracing and testing independently

8

contributed to better outcomes, even after adjusting for other factors. Hence, policies should ensure

9

increased testing is paired with increased contact tracing capacity.

10

High values in the proposed index showed correlation with countries that have been

11

recognized for their success in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including Taiwan,

12

Australia, Iceland, and South Korea. These countries are recognized for their high testing rates and

13

comprehensive contact tracing programs [36,37]. Thus, this analysis provided quantitative evidence

14

supporting policy recommendations to facilitate strong national leadership, expand diagnostic

15

capacity, rapidly enact comprehensive contact tracing, and proactively test for COVID-19 [36,37].

16
17
18

Extrinsic factors affecting testing outcomes
This analysis found that island nations had better testing effectiveness outcomes compared

19

to non-island nations. Geographical isolation is an obvious advantage to controlling infectious

20

disease [38]. The results also showed an association of higher CovTI with authoritarian and unitary

21

forms of government. This result suggests an association between better testing outcomes and more

22

centralized forms of government. Previous research has shown associations between the level of

23

democracy and CFR, where the time trajectories of CFR increase more steeply for democracies than

24

for autocracies, i.e. democracies have higher CFR than autocracies [21]. A higher CFR indicates

25

poorer testing effectiveness, i.e. lower CovTI (Fig 1). Here we show that centralized governments

26

have higher CovTI and lower CFR, which is consistent with Sorci et al. [21]. Thus, extrinsic factors

1

affect a country’s ability to implement testing strategies. Combining this metric with other

2

databases that can account for other possible factors, such as trust in government institutions,

3

demographics, or urban/rural distribution, could further elucidate other extrinsic factors related to

4

COVID-19 testing.

Estimate of true number of cases and detection rate
A parsimonious empirical model was used to estimate the true number of infections and

8

inferred detection rate by back-calculating from reported deaths with adjustments for health system

capacity, government transparency, and testing levels. The results were comparable to more

10

complex modeling approaches based on similar principles [34,35]. The findings suggested that

11

nearly 90% of global infections remain unreported, which is consistent with previous estimates

12

showing that true number of infections are many times higher than reported cases [9–11]. In

13

addition, other authors have used different models to estimate the true number of cases as a

14

percentage of the population in various European countries. For example, period prevalence in Italy

15

was estimated at 4 percent in April [39] and 4.4 percent in France in May [40]. Several of the

16

hardest affected countries early in the pandemic had an estimated period prevalence between 3 and

17

7.5 percent [41]. These estimates were generally consistent with our estimates (Table 3).

18

Seroprevalence of antibodies is often touted as a reliable means to estimate period

19

prevalence and past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Efforts are underway in June 2020 across England,

20

Germany, and the United States, among others, to randomly sample the population and determine

21

country-level seroprevalence. However, due to the specificity of the serological tests, false positives

22

can substantially affect the accuracy of the results[42] Therefore, models and parsimonious

23

estimates may continue to play an important role in estimating the true number of infections.

Herd immunity
The estimates of this model further agree with models in the hardest hit countries, such as

3

Italy or Spain, which estimate that more than five percent of the population in those countries have

4

been infected [41]. However, such a low proportion of the population presumably with antibodies is

5

far from conferring herd immunity that may inhibit future disease transmission. It is important to

6

note that, while these proportions are much higher than the officially reported cases, they do not

7

represent herd immunity—a concept considered important to fully reopening society. Although

8

herd immunity depends on the basic reproductive number (R 0) [43], which varies with effectiveness

9

of interventions, some estimates specify a threshold of 50 to 60 percent seroprevalence to achieve

10

herd immunity [44], while others, accounting for differential susceptibility, estimate the threshold

11

may be as low as 20 percent [45]. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest that herd immunity is not

12

yet occurring at the national level of the countries analyzed.

13
14

Excess deaths

15

Reported deaths are an important indicator. However, excess deaths (i.e., total mortality in

16

excess of seasonal averages) are substantially higher than the reported COVID-19 deaths in many

17

locations, including Brazil, Jakarta, New York City, and Ecuador [46]. These excess deaths suggest

18

such locations have not accurately captured deaths related to COVID-19 in official figures [47].

19

Different definitions of attributable deaths substantially affect data. For example, Russia had

20

previously used a very limited definition for inclusion determined via autopsy that does not count

21

many deaths even if the patient previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [48]. On the other hand,

22

some countries have opted to exhaustively include any presumptive death to COVID-19 in official

23

data. Belgium has included unconfirmed deaths within their COVID-19 death total [49]. In such a

24

case, COVID-19 deaths are greater than excess deaths [46]. These examples of limited or

25

conservative death definitions impact this model’s estimates. Nevertheless, substantial differences

26

between excess deaths and deaths attributed to COVID-19 may indicate insufficient testing or

1

policy decisions that systematially exclude some deaths. While proxy factors, including the

2

adjustments for government transparency and health system capacity, were included to mitigate this

3

factor, it is likely the model estimates will not sufficiently adjust in cases of excessive deaths across

4

such wide ranging scenarios. Including data on excessive deaths could improve the validity of the

5

model; however, such data is usually reported with a lag of several weeks or not reported at all.

6
7
8
9

Sources of uncertainty
Several assumptions were made to generate this model. Most notably, the model assumes
specific and universal relationships between deaths and total number of infections, implying an

10

inherent IFR. Advances in therapeutics and differences in health system capacity will influence this

11

rate, though [21]. In addition, several factors including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and blood

12

groups are known to affect the mortality and hospitalization rates [50–56]. Future analyses may

13

combine CovTI with databases that include these factors. The model also assumes specific

14

relationships between proxy indicators, such as the Global Health Security Index and Democracy

15

Index, and data outcomes. While the direction of the relationship is arguably evident, the magnitude

16

and shape of the relationship is unknown. Furthermore, this model aims to be parsimonious (i.e.,

17

not introducing excessive parameters or uncertainty) and is, by nature, deterministic. The decision

18

to include a minimum number of variables and data was strategic, but a stochastic approach could

19

better illustrate the uncertainty and sensitivity to the above assumptions. The model also reported

20

estimates of total number of cases and detection rates. These values should be used cautiously as a

21

comparative tool, rather than exact values.

22

Conclusion

23

This report described a novel comprehensive metric (COVID-19 Testing Index, CovTI) that

24

evaluates the overall effectiveness of COVID-19 testing in the current pandemic using real-time

25

publicly reported data among 188 countries and territories. The metric incorporated case-fatality

rate, test positivity rate, proportion of active cases, and an estimate of detection rate based upon

2

reported death data by adjusting for heterogeneity in testing levels, health system capacity, and

3

government transparency. The estimated detection rate of COVID-19 aligned satisfactorily with

4

previous empirical and epidemiological models. National policies that allow open public testing and

5

extensive contact tracing were significantly associated with higher values of CovTI, which reflects

6

improvements in the estimated detection rate. Extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and

7

centralized forms of government, were also shown to be associated with higher COVID-19 testing

8

outcomes. Countries should commit to expanding policies on testing and contact tracing in order to

9

reduce levels of undetected infections and reduce disease transmission. Applications of this metric

10

include combining it with different databases to identify other factors that affect testing outcomes or

11

using it to temporally track a holistic measure of testing outcomes at the national level.
