Abstract
Conceptualizing the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic response as a complex
adaptive system is useful to study its key features of emergence, interdependency, and adaptation
yet practical guidance for mixed methods researchers remains limited. This study contributes an
illustrative example and discussion for guiding how a mixed methods convergent sequential
research design, informed by complexity theory and drawing upon open-access datasets, can
rapidly generate complex case study descriptions. This article serves as an essential reference for
identifying points of integration within a sequential convergent design using text mining to
manage large data volumes and studying complex phenomena using a complexity-informed case
study-mixed methods approach to generate novel public health insights.

This study contributes an illustrative example and discussion for guiding how a mixed methods
convergent sequential research design, informed by complexity theory and drawing upon openaccess datasets, can rapidly generate complex case study descriptions. The case studied in this
article draws upon open-access datasets to examine how public health briefings can be used to
build the necessary credibility and trust for effective public health communications during the
unprecedented and rapidly changing conditions surrounding the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic in Alberta (Canada). In the convergent sequential design, qualitative and quantitative
findings are integrated in the follow-up phase for the purpose of generating a more complete
understanding of the initial phase findings. Specifically, this article focuses on the procedures
involved in the follow-up phase generating the meta-inferences from the cross analysis of the
integrated findings at six key fluctuation periods identified in the initial quantitative phase. Full

details of the initial quantitative phase and discussion of the integrated findings are provided
elsewhere (see Bulut & Poth, 2020; Poth, Bulut, Otto, & Aquilina, 2020). We conclude this
article with discussing how attending to three key concepts of complex adaptive systems—
emergence, interdependency, and adaptation—informed the generation of the complex case
description. To begin, we present some background information on the public health crisis
surrounding the COVID-19 global pandemic to explain the conceptualization of the public health
response as a complex adaptive system (CAS) and the overall aim of the intrinsic case study of
the onset of the global pandemic in Alberta (Canada) to inform effective public health
communications. Then we explain the usefulness of complexity theory for studying a CAS and
the application of a case study-mixed methods design with a nested convergent sequential
approach for generating complex case descriptions quickly.

The Global Public Health Crisis Surrounding The COVID-19 Pandemic Response as a
Complex Adaptive System
The public health crisis surrounding COVID-19—an infectious disease caused by a novel
coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2—and the
declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020,
disrupted and changed in nonlinear and unpredictable ways how people around the world live
their lives and interact with others. Phenomena that defy simplistic analyses of cause and effect
and that have the capacity to adapt to contextual changes are known as a CAS (Weaver, 1948).
Conceptualizing the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic response as a CAS is
useful to guide its study because it is influencing and being influenced by a large number of
interacting and interrelated contexts for which there is no central control and such as response

requires ongoing adaptation to changing circumstances. A key component of the initial public
health response to the COVID-19 global pandemic involved the use of regular publicly
accessible media briefings led by public health officials representing regional, national and
international health authorities and government bodies. These media briefings became a key
source of information about emerging understandings about the virus transmission rates and
methods as well as changes to risk factors and preventive measures that needed to be conveyed
in a timely and accurate manner within the rapidly evolving local, national, and international
circumstances.

Studying the public health response to this unprecedented global pandemic as a CAS requires
attending to the key concepts of a CAS in the following three ways: First, that emergence results
from the ability of a CAS to self-organize and be affected by other influences means that
communications will necessarily convey new understandings about the virus as they become
available. Second, that interdependency results from systems being interconnected and parts
entwined with other parts of society means that the public health communications will
necessarily involve information about various sectors as well as being influenced by and
influencing to various sectors (e.g., industries, restaurants, continuing care facilities, hospitals,
and others). Third, that adaptation resulting from living systems surviving and thriving within
their constantly changing environments means that the public health communications will
necessarily need to reflect up-to-date information that is both accurate and timely. Therefore, the
study of a CAS requires appropriate designs and data sources for measuring their nonlinear
trajectories and assessing the patterns emerging within the systems that are continuously selfforming and interacting with each other. Generating in-depth descriptions and insights about the

nature of the patterns of communication and how the patterns changed and evolved over time
was the focus of the current empirical study with the overall aim of informing effective
communication practices during the onset of a global pandemic.

The Usefulness of Complexity Theory for Studying a CAS Using a Case Study-Mixed
Methods Design
Complexity theory is an umbrella term for the study of complexity and complex systems. A CAS
is a special case of complex systems where the whole is more complex than its parts (Holland,
1999). The study of CAS requires new design approaches because it is no longer possible to
study only the parts of the system and the system itself in isolation. Instead it is necessary to
study the interconnections including the possible influences to and results from the interactions
within the system and surrounding systems (Poth & Bullock, 2020). Case study and mixed
methods, alone as well as in combination, are well established research approaches known to
require extensive time to complete (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Guetterman & Fetters, 2018).
A case study involves developing an in-depth description of a case within its real-life bounded
system often defined by place, time, and people (Creswell & Poth, 2017). Case studies draw
upon diverse data sources relevant to the case studied and can involve the integration of both
qualitative and quantitative research in the case description (Yin, 2017). In the widely utilized
typology advanced by Creswell and Plano Clark (2018), mixed methods case studies are
included as one of four complex designs and described as particularly useful for studying
complex systems. Our study is guided by the innovative distinction of the designation case
study-mixed methods (CS-MM) design (Gueterman & Fetters, 2018) where the parent case study
approach is characterized by an intrinsic purpose, a holistic case description, and a nested mixed

methods design as a means to address the time constraints associated with data collection,
analysis, and interpretations.

Our study design addressed the feasibility challenges we experienced as researchers to keep pace
with the rapidly evolving context of the global pandemic. With the overall aim of generating a
comprehensive understanding of the patterns of effective, rapid public health communications,
we use a CS-MM to guide our development of a complex case description through gathering and
integrating diverse sources of data drawing upon open-access datasets and text mining
techniques. Recently, the availability of existing big data stored in the form of text has motivated
researchers to apply modern text mining techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling,
and text classification) to organize, analyze, and gain insights from textual data. The primary
goal of text mining with big data is to analyze information to discover patterns (Aggarwal &
Zhai, 2012). The further use of data and text mining techniques has been identified as an
emerging area for methodological innovations in mixed methods research (Creswell & Plano
Clark, 2018; Poth, 2018).

Application of a Complexity-Informed CS-MMR Design with a Nested Convergent
Sequential Approach for Generating Complex Case Descriptions Quickly
A convergent sequential design represents a departure from the three core design typologies
articulated by Creswell and Plano Clark (2018). Common to both the convergent sequential
design and the explanatory sequential design is an initial quantitative phase. The designs are
distinguishable by the types of data and mixing purpose for the follow-up phase; whereas the
explanatory sequential design traditionally uses qualitative results to explain the initial

quantitative findings, the convergent sequential design uses the integration of quantitative and
qualitative results to generate more complete understandings of the initial quantitative findings.
The second phase of the convergent sequential design has a similar mixing purpose to the
convergent design that is another core design typology described by Creswell and Plano Clark
(2018).

The sequential aspect of the convergent sequential design allows researchers to find or choose a
subsample from the larger quantitative results in the initial phase. Researchers have shown a
great deal of interest in text mining techniques to process large volumes of data more quickly,
extract hidden information, and use the knowledge in decision making (Aggarwal, 2015;
Aggarwal & Zhai, 2012). We are not alone in our application of text mining to study the global
pandemic. Recently researchers around the world have employed sentiment analysis to analyze
sentiments and opinions that people shared about the COVID-19 pandemic through social media
posts (e.g., Barkur et al., 2020; Medford et al., 2020; Samuel et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).
With the rapid growth of textual data in today’s digital world, text mining is likely to remain a
crucial technique that social scientists will employ to better understand complex societal
problems yet it remains an under-utilized approach within mixed methods research designs. In
this study, the two sequential design phases realized the overall objective of generating a
complex case description quickly; the first phase used text mining to identify key fluctuations in
sentiment messaging and word counts across the case and the second phase involved the cross
analysis of the integrated findings at each of the key fluctuation periods. The case description is
guided by attending to the emergence, interdependencies, and adaptations of topic areas and
message contents related to key areas of effective public health communications and risk

assessments necessary to convince the public to follow recommendations during a pandemic
(CDC, 2018; Tumpey et al., 2018). Through the use of a convergent sequential approach nested
within a CS-MM design, this study begins to address the methodological and practical gaps by
generating empirically based meta-inferences from open-access datasets.
Method
In the convergent sequential mixed methods research design, qualitative and quantitative
findings are integrated in the follow-up phase for the purpose of generating a more complete
understanding of the initial phase’s findings. In this study, convergence in the follow-up phase
was assessed across six key fluctuation periods identified in the initial phase to generate the
meta-inferences informing the complex case description (see Table 1).

Selection and Bounding of the Intrinsic Case Studied
Alberta, a Western Canadian province offers an intrinsic context in which to study a localized
response to the pandemic situated within a country with long-established democratic rights and
values, freedom of the press, credible statistical sources, and a publicly-funded healthcare
system. With a population of more than four million, Alberta represents approximately 11% of
Canada’s total population with a smaller, on average, proportion of residents over the age of 65
(13% compared with 17.5% nationally) (Statistics Canada, 2019). In 2019, the Economist ranked
Canada the seventh most democratic nation in its Democracy Index, tied with Denmark and
ahead of all other nations in the Americas (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2019). Its mass media
communications have a high level of media freedom evidenced by its ranking as sixteenth of 180
countries in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index (Reporters Without Borders, 2020). Formed in
1971, Statistics Canada is globally recognized as a producer of credible statistics for all the
provinces as well as for the federal government; it regularly releases open-access datasets and
provides statistical capacity-building around the world (Government of Canada, 2020a). Since

1962, Canada’s publicly funded healthcare system has covered all essential basic needs delivered
through the ten provincial and three territorial systems, and is governed by the Canada Health
Act adopted in 1984 (Government of Canada, 2020b).

The federal and provincial structures in the area of public health create unique opportunities for
coordination; the Public Health Agency of Canada was established in 2004 amidst the
coronavirus outbreak of SARS-CoV-1 and provides oversight at the national level. Dr. Teresa
Tam has served since 2017 in the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada role as the lead health
professional and primary spokesperson on public health related matters for the government of
Canada (“Chief Medical Officer of Canada”, 2020). The vast majority of Canadians (88%) rated
the national public health response to COVID-19 in August 2020 as “good” (Devlin &
Connaughton, 2020) and cases and infection rates are considered by external assessments to be
lower than many global counterparts (Bejan & Nicolova, 2020). A recent survey found
Canadians have a high level of trust in public health officials on COVID-19 (Carleton, 2020)

When considering death rate as the single most fair and reliable statistic in ascertaining how hard
hit any area has been hit by COVID-19, Alberta’s death rate at 58.6 per million is much lower
when compared with other provinces (as of September 21, 2020): Quebec at 648 per million and
Ontario at 194 per million (tableau public, September 15, 2020). The Chief Medical Officer of
Health in Alberta serves as the primary spokesperson representing the Office of the Chief
Medical Officer of Health and provides public health expertise to support health surveillance,
population health and disease control initiatives on issues of public health importance to the
province (Government of Alberta, 2020a). Dr. Deena Hinshaw was appointed to the role in 2019

and has been widely recognized as effective in her public health communications during the
pandemic: “the wise and empathetic chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw deserves
credit for helping to keep Alberta’s death rate so low while keeping the economy so open.”
(Staples, 2020d).

We define the current case boundaries as the province of Alberta (location), March 5 to July 5,
2020, (onset), and Dr. Deena Hinshaw and her office (producers and communicators of the
media briefings). The publicly accessible briefing transcripts provide a proxy for the
communications from public health officials to members of the Alberta public. The onset date is
defined by the first day the briefings were delivered on a regular (almost daily) basis until July 5,
2020.
Data Source Selection and Collection
The study drew upon three sources of data: media briefing transcripts, case statistics, and a key
event timeline (see Figure 1). This study did not require ethics approval because we used existing
research datasets available through the public domain with no new data collected. To examine
the public health communications hosted by Dr. Deena Hinshaw, media briefing transcripts were
downloaded in Word format from the government of Alberta’s COVID-19 pandemic website
(https://www.alberta.ca/covid). To examine the change in number of daily new Alberta
confirmed cases of COVID-19, case statistics were downloaded and aggregated in excel
spreadsheet format from the government of Alberta’s interactive COVID-19 data application
website (https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm). To contextualize the public
health messaging within the rapidly evolving and embedded local, national and international
contexts surrounding the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta, a timeline of key

and entered them into a timeline table drawing upon new sources that were local (e.g., folio,

Canadian National Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Canadian Healthcare Network), and
international (e.g., British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Cable News Network (CNN), and
World Health Organization WHO).

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES
identify positive and negative sentiments at the word, sentence, and document levels (Yi et al.,
2003). For this study, we used the sentiment scores from a previous study in which sentiment
analysis was applied to extract sentiment scores from the textual data in the media briefings (for
a full description, see Bulut & Poth, 2020). In brief, word tokenization in the tidytext (Silge &
Robinson, 2016) and tokenizer (Mullen et al., 2018) packages in R (R Core Team, 2020) were
applied to sentences in the media briefings to split them into individual words. After filtering out
stop words (e.g., the, a, that, on), the remaining words were merged with the Bing lexicon (Hu &
Liu, 2004) in order to categorize the words as either positive or negative. For each media
briefing, the sentiment score was calculated as the difference between the number of positive and
negative words. Descriptive analysis involved the use of word counts in the media briefings. The
goal of descriptive analysis was to identify the media briefings in which Dr. Hinshaw’s briefing
was either very short or very long. Purposefully we defined the fluctuations to include four days
to balance feasibility of analysis with the realities that case counts and news can be delayed by a
day or two.

The second phase of the design involved conducting a cross analysis of the integrated findings at
each of the key fluctuation periods identified in the first phase to generate the meta-inferences
informing the complex case description. We used the qualitative dominant crossover mixed
analysis (Onwuegbuzie & Hitchcock, 2015) to generate the integrated findings at each of the six
key fluctuation periods across the case involving findings from four data sources: qualitative
themes from the media briefing transcripts, key timeline events from the online news searches,
key topics and associated terms from the quantitative topical modelling, and new case statistics
from the quantitative descriptive analysis.

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES

To begin, two of the authors independently conducted the qualitative analysis of the subset of
media briefings organized chronologically by fluctuation period. This work was guided by a
three stage coding cycle (Saldaña, 2015). In the first stage, we read all the transcripts delivered
during key fluctuation periods (N = 16) to familiarize ourselves with the data, and then we
undertook a line-by-line initial coding approach of the briefings (Charmaz, 2014). This openended coding method allowed us to remain aware of the possibilities emerging from the data and
to develop a preliminary code list which was then reviewed by the authors, revised, and
organized by five themes and 11 sub-themes (Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2018). The codes
were then applied to the subsequent transcripts for key fluctuation periods. A document analysis
of the key events during each key fluctuation at local, national, and international levels were
noted. Topic modeling was used to generate insights from the clustering of similar word groups
and expressions that characterize the media briefings across the months using the topicmodels
package (Grün & Hornik, 2011) in R (R Core Team, 2020). Topic modeling is an exploratory
text mining technique to discover topics covered in a set of documents by grouping similar
words and expressions (Ramage et al., 2009; Wallach, 2006). New case statistics was analyzed
using R (R Core Team, 2020) to identify important daily fluctuations (e.g., spikes in new cases
and sharp declines) in new confirmed cases of COVID-19. New case counts were chosen over
the total number of cases because that enabled the detection of a large daily fluctuations in the
number of confirmed cases, was more easily comparable to the Canadian statistics, and was
deemed more accurate.

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES
Integration was undertaken at each of the six key fluctuation periods using the qualitative themes
as the organizational framework on which to converge the quantitative findings from topic
modelling and case statistics to generate a more complete description of the key fluctuations;
both were guided by a qualitative crossover mixed analysis approach (Onwuegbuzie &
Hitchcock, 2015). The application of the concepts of emergence of new understandings,
interdependency of the local, national, and international contexts, and adaptation of new
measures and protocols meant that the processes involved in integration were iterative and spirallike as the integrated findings were represented narratively in the case description. In so doing,
we embraced the iterative flexibility described by Heinrich and colleagues (2016) and spiral
metaphor proposed by Schoonenboom (2019) to respond to contextualizing opportunities for the
key timeline events as connections were made between the narrative data to bring new meaning
to the numerical data.

Team Approach
Throughout the study, the interdisciplinary team of four researchers met to bring together their
diverse expertise to move the research forward and in, so doing, embodied the concept of team
integration described by Fetters and Molina-Azorin as one which “involves leveraging personal
and professional background experiences that lead one to consider, and hold valuable,
qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods procedures for making sense of the world” (2017, p.
296). The first author brought extensive experience in applying complexity science to mixed
methods as well as qualitative case research experiences to lead the overall design, integration
and methodological purpose. The second author brought extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiences to lead the first phase and contribute to implementation and writing. The third author

was a doctoral student who was actively acquiring diverse experiences across diverse research
methodologies and contributed to the data collection analysis and integration. The fourth author
brought experience in emergency outbreak management and public health expertise. Together
the team generated case meta-inferences that would otherwise have been inaccessible by the
researchers working alone.
Phase 1: Identification of Key Fluctuations Periods from Initial Quantitative Findings
The initial phase findings identified six key fluctuations periods to serve as the points of
integration in the follow-up phase. Figure 2 and 3 presents the data trends in sentiment analysis
word counts of the media briefings respectively. Table 2 summarizes the sentiment scores and
descriptive results to justify the selection of the key fluctuation periods (see also Bulut & Poth,

The Pandemic Leadership Response Prior to March 5
The context changed rapidly during the first three months of 2020. The risk assessment for
Canadians remained low on January 3, when Dr. Tam reported no cases of COVID-19 in Canada
and noted: "It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't
think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned," (Slaughter, 2020). By the end of
January, the WHO had declared a global health emergency and Canada’s first three cases had
been reported along with further reassurances from Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, of
the measured responses the government was taking: “I can reassure Canadians that the health
risk to Canadians continues to be low. We are taking all necessary precautions to prevent the
spread of infection… Preventative measures are in place in airports” (Staples, 2020c). By midFebruary, Dr. Hinshaw, on February 14—a month before the Canadian border would close and

weeks before the first case would be detected in Alberta— communicated information about the
virus, provided directions about needed actions, and called for unity in our response, stating:
“Whatever the future of coronavirus, we are stronger together. Don’t let the virus divide us”
(Staples, 2020b). On March 5, Dr. Deena Hinshaw began providing regular public health
briefings at 3:30 in the afternoons. She assured Albertans of their preparation, saying during the
initial briefing: “we have been preparing for this since the first virus emerged in January.”

Case Meta-inference 1: Communicating Risk Assessments and Measures
Dr. Hinshaw began each briefing by updating the numbers of new cases, total cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths. Figure 4 compares the low consistent rates of new case trends in
Alberta with the greater fluctuation in total new cases in Canada. During the initial briefings and
throughout the month of March, Dr. Hinshaw repeatedly cautioned to isolate following travel
and when not feeling well. Dr. Hinshaw led by example when, in mid-March, she, herself came
down with a cold, which was not COVID-19 related, and she described the situation to model
how to self-isolate properly (Staples, 2020b). She made a point about each person’s contribution
to manage risks as best as possible: “I encourage every Albertan to take an active role in their
health and our collective health as we respond to this pandemic.”

As cases initially increased in Alberta, the overall sentiment messaging was more negative and
Dr. Hinshaw’s messaging shifted to emphasize the realities of the trends: “These are significant
case numbers, and they underscore the seriousness of the situation that we face.” The lag
between exposure and symptoms was seen as a threat to others: “many of the new cases that are
currently being diagnosed were exposed up to two weeks ago before control measures were fully

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES
in place.” A further foreshadowing of further cases in Alberta in the coming weeks because of
the evolving national and global contexts conveyed with the statement: “As you know, multiple
cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed across the world including a growing number of cases
here in Canada.” As the outbreaks became more numerous throughout March, the sentiment was
more negative than positive and word counts increased until she announced plans to move the
outbreak updates to online postings and to only focus the briefings on unusual outbreaks. Dr.
Hinshaw took great care to provide accurate information evidenced by beginning one of the
briefings with an apology addressing incorrect identification of an outbreak site as active when it
was resolved.

Those at greatest risk were identified as elderly and residents in continuing care facilities; yet
outbreaks at a social gathering eventually linked to cases across the province. This heightened
the risk assessment and a shift in messaging to convey that anyone was at risk: “We continue to
confirm new cases in every zone, and in all age groups. We are all being impacted by this virus.”
This message was relayed around the time that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began selfisolating on March 12, as his wife had tested positive for the virus following travel to the UK
(Staples, 2020b). In providing her risk assessments, Dr. Hinshaw provided sufficient information
to establish trust with her audience evidenced by the following description: “She’s [Dr. Hinshaw
has] quickly become a trusted face for Albertans, calmly delivering the facts as cases of COVID19 are confirmed in the province” (Ramsay, 2020).

Case Meta-inference 2: Demonstrating Empathy and Rapport-Building
Dr. Hinshaw began several initial briefings with the same format; she introduced herself,
identified her role, provided reassurances, and described the risk to Albertans as low. Dr.
Hinshaw acknowledged deaths, anxieties, and supports both frankly and with compassion
evidenced by her provision of a realistic assessment of future deaths following the first death in
the province on March 19, saying: “Though we are doing everything we can to limit cases of
critical illnesses and death from this serious virus, tragically we know that deaths will occur.” By
late March, Hinshaw had gained national attention for her public health leadership and was
described as having “become a sort of guardian angel figure. She gives daily briefings, which are

broadcast live and in which she manages to sound calm, kind and compassionate while being
completely open and truthful about the number of people infected and the precautions that must
be taken to prevent further spread” (Steward, 2020).

Throughout the case, Dr. Hinshaw described sources of anxiety as stemming from the constantly
changing testing guidelines and the influx of information: “Many may feel overwhelmed and
unsure of what’s important to know and what information has changed.” Dr. Hinshaw’s timing
of addressing the general strain being experienced by families by the school and non-essential
business closures in mid-March closely aligned with the news reporting and Alberta’s relaunch
plans (Johnson, 2020; Government of Alberta, 2020b). In her announcing of reopening Dr.
Hinshaw recognized that individuals may be experiencing different reactions: “We have all been
affected by this pandemic. It’s completely natural to feel overwhelmed, sad or scared. You are
not alone in feeling this way.” Dr. Hinshaw repeated information about mental health supports
several times and provided a range of specific ideas for managing the isolation in the briefings
ranging from getting outside (while maintaining distance), using video chats, and a new concept
of ‘cohort families’ where two families agree to isolate from others and to focus on supporting
one another: “Many Albertans out there feel alone, are afraid, or are unable to go out because
they are at high risk of infection. I encourage all of us to reach out to members of the community
who may be in this position.” By openly referencing both general and more specific discomforts,
Dr. Hinshaw connected with the public in ways that were described by others as: “...[Hinshaw]
has always shown calmness, compassion and leadership that mark her daily COVID-19
updates… Hinshaw has been widely commended for her calm and measured delivery in press

briefings, her solid command of the pandemic response and genuine expressions of empathy for
those suffering from the disease” (McMaster, 2020).

Case Meta-inference 3: Updating Information and Actions
Dr. Hinshaw made a declaration that she would keep to keep the public informed: “We will also
continue to be transparent and keep Albertans fully informed of any developments.” Dr.
Hinshaw took care to take responsibility of any missteps evidenced by an apology addressing a
lack of consultation with and notification to operators about changes to visitor policy at
continuing care facilities. Areas of developments in new understandings involved that
transmission was possible when asymptomatic, testing was critical for tracing and isolation, and
preventive measures including enhanced screening.

Canadians were advised to stay home and avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada in
mid-March (Staples, 2020c) and around the world borders were closing including the U.S.Canada border to non-essential travel on March 25 (Staples, 2020d). The Canadian government
passed emergency legislation and introduced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (known
as CERB) (Government of Canada, 2020c) and invoked the Quarantine Act on March 26 which
mandated all returning travellers to isolate for 14 days on March 26 (Staples, 2020d). Strict
measures for social distancing and mass gatherings were introduced in March and described in
Alberta’s Pandemic Response document (Bench, 2020). The guidelines to distance, wash hands,
stay home when sick, and cover coughs and sneezes remained constant and aligned with news
sources. Other preventive measures evolved over time, in response to cases—such as restricting
the size of outdoor gatherings in response to case numbers: “We are making this shift based on

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES
several factors, including an analysis of how the virus is spreading in Alberta and the reduced
risk of gatherings held outdoors.”

The associated words generated by the topic modelling suggest a shift in messaging about
emerging understandings: in March the focus was on awareness of risk, and by June, it shifted to
protection of community. It is also interesting to note that half of the associated words are
common to those two months (see Table 3). Many of the unique words refer to the prevention
measures in place at the time; for example, in March the messages conveyed the need to stay
home, isolate and take the time to care for those at risk (associated words are italicized) whereas
in June the messages expressed the need to protect the public, people, businesses, and facilities
from outbreaks.
Dr. Hinshaw continually highlighted contributions of the government; their planning and
mobilization efforts early on, expanding testing access, and launching the mobile-based tracing
technology in May. There were clear connections between the comments about needing to work
together to prevent the spread of infection and the associated words generated by the topic
modelling. This suggests consistency messaging about needed actions and cautions in both April
and May as the common words related to continue to test, avoid spread and care for people
(associated words are italicized); whereas the unique words in April reflected what was going on
at the time related to outbreaks at facilities, and then in May the focus shifted to supporting
community. As well Dr. Hinshaw regularly recognized the efforts of Albertans as a whole and
groups of individuals for their contributions to the public health response: “Every act–those big
or small–lifts us up as a province and demonstrates how quickly Albertans take action to care for
one another,” and “I want to end today by saying how grateful I am to everyone for following the

public health guidelines…. Let’s continue to take pride in that protection of each other as we
move forward—to enjoy our activities, but with caution and care for those around us.” Dr.
Hinshaw’s masterful ability to point out how the actions can benefit or protect the larger
community is evidenced by the description bestowed upon her by others, “We now count on
Hinshaw. Always reassuring with her quiet, steady delivery. Always reminding us of the simple
steps to protect ourselves. Always urging us to do the right thing, though never scolding”
(Staples, 2020b).

The Ongoing Pandemic Response Since July 5.
On July 5, the number of new cases had stabilized and Dr. Deena Hinshaw stopped providing
regular public health briefings. At the time of this writing (September 22, 2020), the pandemic is
ongoing and it is yet unknown when the public health crisis will cease to require a coordinated
response. As the weather turns colder as winter approaches, there are increased concerns in
Alberta about indoor exposure risks.
Discussion and Implications
Contribution to Public Health Communication Literature
The complex case description reveals novel insights about how public health briefings can build
credibility and trust within the rapidly evolving context of a global pandemic to address the
phase 2 guiding research question (see Table 1). Specifically, we see the masterful weaving of
three key functions of a chief public health officer related to risk assessments and
communications, demonstrations of empathy, and actionable information updates (see Table 4).

The novelty of the virus and the challenges inherent to predicting transmission rates meant that
interpreting case data trends was an essential part of the chief public health officer’s function to
provide credible risk assessments and communications (CDC, 2018). Our case description
provides evidence of the consistent use of the same case statistics from a trusted institution to
inform shifts in risk assessments and the provision of reasoned interpretations of the data as
informing changes to the recommended prevention measures. The risk assessments and
communications were effective when the changes to prevention measures were accompanied by
detailed explanations that the shifts to risk assessments were responding to emerging data trends
from trusted sources.

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES

The unprecedented impacts on the daily interactions of the public meant that explicitly
recognizing the far-reaching, changeable, and unique effects on individuals and groups was
a key feature of the chief public health officer’s function to demonstrate empathy in ways that
resonate with affected audiences (Tumpey et al., 2018). Our case description offers many
illustrative examples of both shared and unique impacts of the virus; from new concerns for
loved ones living in long term care facilities and stresses for families with school closures to new
discomforts associated with physical distancing measures and financial anxieties arising from
business closures. The demonstrations of empathy through expressing sympathy and describing
supports became more candid and specific over time as rapport with the Alberta public was built.

Updating the public on the rapidly changing information surrounding the virus meant
communicating in ways that were understandable and timely was a necessary focus of the chief
public health officer’s work in motivating the general public to heed public health
recommendations (CDC, 2018; WHO, 2012). Our case description draws attention to the
essential role for the briefings to be specific in how the actions affected others and timely as well
as aligned with other information sources. The information was more persuasive when the
benefits of individual and collective actions to protect the larger community was communicated
explicitly and reflected what was also being reported in the news.
Contributions to Mixed Methods Research Practice
This study contributes an illustrative example and discussion for guiding how a mixed methods
convergent sequential research design, informed by complexity theory and drawing upon openaccess datasets, can rapidly generate complex case study descriptions. Specifically, the article

CONVERGENT SEQUENTIAL DESIGN FOR CASE STUDIES
advances mixed methods research practice in two ways and in so doing heeds the calls for
illustrative examples of novel combinations of data procedures constituting methodological
advancements (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Mertens et al., 2016). First, the use of text mining
to manage large volumes of open-access data efficiently for the purpose of identifying atypical
periods of sentiment fluctuation to serve as the points of integration within a sequential
convergent mixed methods design. Our generation of a holistic complex case description from
the cross analysis of the integrated findings at the six key fluctuation periods mitigated the
limitations of either qualitative or quantitative approaches alone more efficiently than had we
collected the data ourselves or analyzed the entire case dataset. Second, the use of a complexityinformed CS-MM design to study complex phenomena for the purpose of generating novel
public health insights aligns with one of the four theoretical conceptions of complexity theory for
mixed methods researchers advanced by Kallenmeyn and colleagues (2020). Our CS-MM design
procedures, informed by complexity theory, provide practical guidance for documenting the
emergent, interdependent, and adaptive realities of the initial public health response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Together, these collective insights along with drawing upon the
interdisciplinary and diverse methodological expertise of the researchers involved in the current
study, we provide an essential reference for others to learn from and build upon.
Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions
Reliance on open access data creates new opportunities for the use of text mining techniques
within mixed methods research designs as an efficient means to detect trends within large
datasets. While the use of media briefings is unique as a means of accessing the message
conveyed by public health authorities, it is also limited because we do not have data about the
impacts of the messages on the public’s behaviour. Future studies could include interviews with

the public health authorities involved in the creation and delivery to seek an ‘insider’
perspective, including Dr. Deena Hinshaw herself, if possible. Our case boundary of the onset
period of the pandemic should be considered in light of the fact the pandemic is ongoing at the
time of writing, and global public health response and communication efforts are continuing.
Future studies could expand the case boundaries to include further data sources and time periods.
Conclusion
The integration of publicly accessible data during the unprecedented and rapidly changing
situation surrounding the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta (Canada) contributes to
novel insights about how public health briefings can build credibility and trust within the rapidly
evolving context of a global pandemic. Specifically, we provide practical examples relating three
key functions of a chief public health officer related to risk assessments and communications,
demonstrations of empathy, and actionable information updates for enhancing the effectiveness
of public health communications during the onset of a pandemic. The current article
demonstrates how text mining procedures within a mixed methods convergent sequential
research design, informed by complexity theory and drawing upon open-access datasets, rapidly
generate complex case study descriptions. This study highlights the usefulness of
conceptualizing the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a complex adaptive
system and calls for further application of complexity science in mixed methods research
designs.
