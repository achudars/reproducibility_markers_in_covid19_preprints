Abstract

38

We report the implementation of a two-step strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2

39

variants carrying the spike deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70). This spike deletion resulted in a

40

S-gene target failure (SGTF) of a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Whole genome

41

sequencing performed on 37 samples with SGTF revealed several receptor-binding domain

42

mutations co-occurring with

43

detection of the variant of concern 202012/01 in France on December 21th 2020.

More importantly, this strategy enabled the first

44

Since September a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70) has attracted

45

increasing attention. This deletion was detected in the cluster-5 variant identified both in

46

minks and humans in Denmark. This cluster-5 variant carries a receptor binding domain

47

(RBD) mutation Y453F and was associated with reduced susceptibility to neutralizing

48

antibodies to sera from recovered COVID-19 patients [1–3]. The

49

occurred with two other RBD mutations of increasing interest [4]: N439K that is currently

50

spreading in Europe and might also have reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

51

[5]; and N501Y that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 recently

52

detected in England [6]. Although the impact of ΔH69/ΔV70 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

53

is not clear, enhanced surveillance is urgently needed. Herein we report the implementation of

54

a two-step strategy enabling a rapid detection of VOC 202012/01 or other variants carrying

55

ΔH69/ΔV70.

56

ΔH69/ΔV70 associated with S-gene target failure of a three-target RT-PCR assay

57

As part of routine SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance performed at national reference centre

58

(NRC) for respiratory viruses (Lyon, France) [7], a 6-nucleotide deletion (21765-21770)

59

within the S gene was identified in two nasopharyngeal samples collected on September 1st

60

and 7th , respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis had been performed with the

61

Applied Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,

62

USA) that includes the ORF1ab, S, and N gene targets. For these two samples, a S-gene target

63

failure (SGTF) was reported while ORF1ab and N targets were positive with Ct values < 25

64

(Figure 1A).

65

The mean coverage for the whole genome sequences generated was 6903x and 6898x,

66

respectively and the S deletion 21765-21770 was present in 100% of the reads. Using CoV-

67

GLUE online resource [8], we found that the S deletion 21765-21770 led to the removal of 2

68

amino acids (ΔH69/ΔV70) in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit of the S protein

ΔH69/ΔV70 has also co-

69

(Figure 1B). The whole genome sequencing (WGS) method used was the amplicon-based

70

ARTIC v3 protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019) combined with Nextera DNA Flex

71

library and sequencing on NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, USA). To confirm the

72

presence of the deletion, one sample was also sequenced with an untargeted metagenomic

73

protocol that yielded the same sequence. Of note, this metagenomic approach could not be

74

applied for the second sample due to low viral load [9].

75

Although the coordinates of the primer/probe binding regions were not available for the

76

TaqPath kit, the manufacturer confirmed that the S deletion H69-V70 was in the area targeted

77

by the test.

78

ΔH69/ΔV70 screening with RT-PCR followed by WGS

79

We then performed a retrospective analysis of RT-PCR results obtained using the TaqPath kit

80

from August 3rd to December 20th. We selected only positive samples with a Ct value < 25 for

81

the N target, the most sensitive target of the test. By doing so, we found that 59/9,266 (0.6%)

82

of positive tests had no amplification of the S gene. No significant increase of the SGTF was

83

noticed over time; the proportion ranging from 0% (week # 32, 33, 34, 42, 48-51) to 2.91%

84

(week # 35; Figure 2). Among the 59 samples with SGTF, 36 were available for WGS. These

85

36 samples were collected from August 5th to November 11th (18/36 were collected after

86

October 9th). A total of 11 samples that presented an amplification of the S target were also

87

sequenced. The sequencing results were fully concordant with the RT-PCR profiles (100% of

88

the samples with SGTF had the S deletion ΔH69/ΔV70, while 100% of the S-gene positive

89

samples did not contain

90

detected and are summarized in Table 1. The most frequent S mutations co-occurring with

91

ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion were S477N and D614G that were found in 21/36 samples (58.3%). The

92

co-occurrence of N439K and D614G mutations was found in 10/36 samples; the first sample

ΔH69/ΔV70).

For samples with SGTF, other S mutations were

93

containing this combination of mutation was collected on August 5th. Of note the complete

94

combination of S mutations detected in cluster-5 variant was not found.

95

The 2-step strategy presented herein and based on a screening with TaqPath Kit followed by

96

WGS for samples with SGTF has been implemented in France since December 20th. On

97

December 21th, the virology laboratory of university hospital of Tours reported a SGTF on a

98

nasopharyngeal sample from a patient with a recent travel history from England (London).

99

The sample was addressed to NRC for WGS and the detection of VOC 202012/01 (lineage

100

B.1.1.7) was confirmed on December 25th that corresponded to the first detection of this

101

variant in France (GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_735391).

102

Discussion and conclusion

103

According to CoV-GLUE resource [8] (last update from GISAID: December 14th), the S

104

deletion 21765-21770 has been identified in 4,632 sequences worldwide (>99% in Europe)

105

Interestingly, only 16 sequences containing this deletion were sampled between March 15th

106

and July 23th corresponding to the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Herein,

107

using data obtained with TaqPath RT-PCR kit, we found an overall prevalence of 0.6%,

108

suggesting a limited circulation of variants presenting the

109

second wave of the pandemic in Lyon, France.

110

It should be underlined that N439K, Y453F, or N501Y RBD mutations that can co-occurred

111

with ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion might be associated with an increased affinity to ACE2 or reduced

112

sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [3, 5, 10–12]. It has been hypothesized that the

113

ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion might compensate some RBD mutations and might be involved in the

114

transmissibility of variant containing these mutations [4, 6]. In addition, it has been recently

115

shown that the combined

116

antibodies [13]. As the N-terminal domain may interact with lung receptors [14] and might be

117

a target of neutralizing antibodies [15, 16], further studies are needed to understand the

118

consequences of

119

response.

120

Importantly, the TaqPath kit used for this study did not lead to a false negative conclusion as

121

the two other targets remain positive. The data presented herein emphasize that the TaqPath

122

RT-PCR assay is a useful and cost-effective tool enabling a rapid, large-scale screening of

123

SARS-CoV-2 variants with ΔH69/ΔV70. Samples with SGTF should be further addressed to

124

national referral laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. This 2-step strategy can contribute to

125

the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 which has been found to be more

126

transmissible than non-VOC lineage [17]. This strategy is currently being reinforced in France

127

as national diagnostic platforms have mainly implemented the TaqPath RT-PCR kit.
