Summary
Background Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic. It
is essential to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and uncover potential risk factors for
severe disease to reduce the overall mortality rate of COVID-19.
Methods Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 93 severe
non-ICU patients at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included in this study. Medical records,
including
demographic,
platelet
counts,
heparin-involved
treatments,
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were
analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors.
Findings Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46
nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count
(PLT) less than 50×109/L, of whom 76% (19/25) had a platelet decrease of >50% compared to baseline;
96% of these patients (24/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52·2% (24/46) had
severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6·7% (1/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal
replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81·3% of critical CRRT
patients (13/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a
marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with
heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naïve patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT
may occur in COVID-19.
Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a
progressive platelet decrease. Exposure to a high dose of heparin may trigger further severe
thrombocytopenia with a fatal outcome. An alternative anticoagulant other than heparin should be used
to treat COVID-19 patients in critical condition.

Introduction
Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
that is structurally related to the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has
developed into a global pandemic, with two million infections and 130000 deaths.1-3 Currently, the
mortality of COVID-19 has reached as high as 13%, such as in France and Italy.4 In China,
approximately 81% of COVID-19 patients have been mild cases, whereas 14% have been severe cases
with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that require ventilator support, and 5% have been
critical patients who need intensive care unit (ICU) admission.5 The survival rate of critical patients is no
more than 50%. Elderly people and people who have underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for
developing more serious complications, such as septic shock, ARDS, acute kidney injury (AKI), and
fulminant myocarditis.6,7 Approximately 81% of deaths occurred among people aged >60 years in
China.5
As a new infectious disease, COVID-19 is characterized by severe acute respiratory injury and
hyperinflammation-related syndromes. The poor prognosis predictors uncovered by retrospective studies
include hypercytokinemia6, significantly elevated hallmarks of an inflammatory response (e.g. IL-6, Creactive protein (CRP), and serum ferrin) and organ failure (e.g., aspartate or alanine transaminase (AST
or ALT), cardiac troponin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)),7,8 and SARS-CoV-2-related RNAemia.9
Additionally, severe thrombocytopenia, elevated neutrophils, and reduced lymphocyte have also been
reported extensively in critical patients.10,11 Combined with progressive pulmonary lesions on CT
imaging, these findings may be helpful to establish more appropriate clinical guidance for critically ill
cases.
A low platelet count or thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of severe disease and
mortality in patients with SARS and COVID-19 for reasons that are not fully understood.12 Heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a well-recognized complication of heparin therapy, and can occur
spontaneously, independent of heparin.13-15 HIT is caused by the binding of heparin to platelet factor 4
(PF4) released from activated platelets, as antibodies against the heparin-PF4 complex are induced in
some patients. Subsequently, the antibody-PF4-heparin complex binds to the platelet FcγIIa receptor,
inducing platelet activation and aggregation, activation of the coagulation pathways and an eventual loss
of circulating platelets, with a prothrombotic state.16,17 Nevertheless, HIT can be induced in the absence
of proximate heparin exposure, so-called spontaneous HIT, by negatively charged bacterial, nucleic
acids, and hypersulfated chondroitin.18-20 Most patients who develop spontaneous HIT have proximate
episodes of infection or major surgery.18
In this study, 61 critical ICU patients and 93 severe non-ICU patients hospitalized from February 8
to April 03 at Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China), an emergency hospital established in for COVID19 patients, were included. We found that a substantial percentage of the critical ICU patients (31·1%,
19/61) who showed severe, progressive decreases in platelet counts, often with fatal outcomes. Further
analysis showed an elevated level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies (HIT antibodies) in critical patients,
which suggested that HIT contribute greatly to the fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients in critical
condition.

Methods
Patients and data collection
Sixty-one patients with confirmed COVID-19 in critical condition were admitted to Wuhan
Huoshengshan Hospital, a hospital established for severe and critical COVID-19 patients, from February
8 to March 18. Every patient had stayed in the intensive care unit for more than three days (herein and
after referred to as ICU patients) and had at least three consecutively detected platelet counts data.
Another 93 patients with severe COVID-19 who had never stayed in the ICU were randomly selected
from the hospital (herein and after referred to as non-ICU patients). The diagnosis of COVID-19 was
made according to Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19.21 Viral RNA was confirmed in all patients
by reverse transcription real-time PCR in the clinical laboratory of the hospital, except for patient P11
who was RNA-positive before admission to the hospital but turned to be negative during the
hospitalization. The clinical outcomes were recorded up to April 03, 2020. Routine blood tests and
coagulation tests were performed in the hospital laboratory on admission and during the hospitalization.
Demographic data for the patients, including information on age and gender, are shown in
supplementary table S1. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Huoshenshan Hospital
(Wuhan, China).

Anti-heparin-PF4 antibody assay (HIT assay)
Human anti-heparin-PF4 complex antibodies (IgG) were detected using an antigen-sandwiched
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit produced by Jonln Biological Company (Cat
JL12174). Briefly, 50 µl of serum was added to a microwell coated with heparin-PF4 complex,
incubated at 37°C and washed with washing buffer. Then, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
hepairn-PF4 was added, incubated, and carefully washed, HRP activity was determined by the ability to
convert the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue products. The amount of HIT
antibodies was quantified using a set of calibration standards provided by the manufacturer.
Serum C3a determination
Serum C3a levels were determined by a two-antibody sandwich ELISA similar to the HIT assay. In
the assay, the microplate well was coated with anti-C3a antibody (capturing antibody), and the presence
of C3a in patient’s serum was quantified with an HRP-conjugated C3a antibody.
Statistical analysis
For the survival rate and qualitative data comparisons among different groups, the P-value was
calculated using the Chi-Square Test (χ2) or Fisher’s exact test in R (version 3.6.2). A t-test was used to
determine the significant difference. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were presented
as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM.
Results
Severe, progressive thrombocytopenia was observed in critical COVID-19 patients
To address the fact that many patients in the ICU received transfusions, the complete blood count
data during hospitalization were analyzed. As expected, decreased red blood cell count (RBC) and
hemoglobin (RGB) were observed in most ICU patients (figure 1A). To our surprise, a progressive,
severe decrease in platelet count (PLT) occurred in critical ICU patients with fatal outcomes (figure 1A
and S1A, and table 1), but rarely occurred in ICU survivors (figure 2 and table 1) and non-ICU patients
with severe COVID-19 (figure S1B). As shown in table 1, severe thrombocytopenia (PLT≤50×109/L)
was observed in 1·1% of non-ICU patients (1/93), whereas it occurred in 41% of ICU patients (25/61),
of whom 96% were ICU nonsurvivors (24/25). Moreover, approximately 52·2% of the ICU
nonsurvivors (24/46) had a PLT count less than 50×109/L, compared to 6·7% among ICU survivors
(1/15) (table 1). Notably, 21·7% of ICU nonsurvivors (10/46) had critical thrombocytopenia, with PLT
less than 10×109/L in the very late phase (1-3 days before death) of the disease (figure 1B and table 1).
Significant PLT decreases (a decrease of >50% at the last sampling date compared to that at the
admission date) were also observed in 56·5% of ICU nonsurvivors (26/46) but in neither ICU survivors
nor non-ICU patients (figure 1C).
Analysis the variations in PLT in nine ICU nonsurvivors (patient P1-P6 and P16-P18) during
hospitalization in detail found that PLT began to decrease 20-40 days after the onset of the illness and
progressively decreased to a critical condition in the next 5-30 days (figure 1A and S1A).
Countermeasures such as transfusion with blood cells, platelets or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) showed
little if any effect on the PLT decreases (figure 1A and S1A), suggesting that progressive PLT
exhaustion occurred in dying COVID-19 patients for unknown reason other than blood coagulation
factor exhaustion. Administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), an inhibitor of inflammation that has been
suggested for used in COVID-19 by Chinese guidelines for COVID-19, seemed to be able to reverse the
changes in PLT transiently in patient P1-P6, except P2, but severe thrombocytopenia recurred a few
days after the administration (figure 1A). As a control, only one out of fifteen ICU survivors (patient
P57) showed extremely low PLT, but without a progressive PLT decrease (figure 2A and 2B). These
results suggested that severe thrombocytopenia with progressively platelet count decrease occurred in
most critical COVID-19 patients before a fatal outcome.
Continuous renal replacement therapy and heparin exposure induce critical thrombocytopenia

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is commonly used in the ICU for correction of
metabolic acidosis, removal of cytokines and other indications in critical COVID-19 patients. However,
among 16 CRRT patients (P2-P17), CRRT triggered a sharp decrease in PLT in most patients (figure 1A,
3A, S1A, and S1C). Notably, among the CRRT-treated COVDI-19 patients, patient P15, the only
survivor of CRRT with moderate pneumonia but critical kidney failure, and patient P11, who was viral
RNA-negative from the time of admission to the hospital, showed no decline in PLT after CRRT
treatment compared with other CRRT treated COVID-19 patients (figure 3A), suggesting that CRRT
could induce a significant decrease in PLT in critical patients with severe COVID-19 characteristic
pneumonia.
Accordingly, a seriously reduced PLT to less than 50×109/L was observed in 81·3% of CRRT
patients (13/16) after CRRT therapy, of whom 46·2% (6/13) further decreased to a level less than
10×109/L in a few days after CRRT treatment (figure 3B and S1C). Comparing with that, only 26·7% in
non-CRRT ICU patients (12/45), and 1·1% in non-ICU patients (1/93) had a decreased PLT less than
50×109/L (table 1). Moreover, a significant PLT fall of more than 50% was also observed in CRRT
patients (56·2%, 9/16) compared to non-CRRT ICU patients (40%, 18/45) (P=0·061) (figure 3C),
particularly for non-CRRT ICU survivors (7·1%, 1/14) (figure 3D). For non-CRRT patients, the average
decrease in PLT in nonsurviving patients was 39·6%, compared to -6·55% (i.e., increased by 6·55%) in
survivors (figure 3D), indicating that a significant decrease in PLT may be a risk factor for high
mortality in COVID-19.
In concert with severe thrombocytopenia, 11 out of 16 ICU patients treated with CRRT died within
three days post CRRT, and the other four died within 6-10 days post CRRT treatment (figure 1A and
3A). The only surviving patient (P15) was admitted to the ICU because of critical kidney failure but not
severe SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia, as mentioned above. The survival rate of patients who
received CRRT treatment was only 6·3% (1/16), far lower than the ICU patients who did not receive
CRRT treatment (31·1%, 14/45) (figure 3E, left panel). These data collectively suggested that CRRT
might contribute to the high mortality of critical COVID-19 patients by inducing severe
thrombocytopenia.
The progressive decrease in PLT in ICU patients suggested the possibility of HIT, since lowmolecular-weight heparin (enoxaparine, LMWH) is routinely used as an anticoagulant in CRRT therapy
in the hospital. LMWH is also widely used in elderly, bedridden ICU patients for the prevention of
thrombosis and the management of coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In
all 45 ICU patients without CRRT, 27 patients received LMWH. A higher but not statistically significant
(P=0·09) percentage of these patients had severe thrombocytopenia (PLT≤50×109/L) than did patients
without LMWH (37·0%, 10/27 vs 11·1%, 2/18) (table 2). A lower survival rate was also observed in the
non-CRRT patients exposed to heparin compared with non-CRRT patients without heparin exposure
(25·9%, 7/27 vs 38·9%, 7/18) (figure 3E, right panel). Consistent with the fact that a smaller dose of
LMWH was applied in non-ICU patients just for flushing of the central venous catheter, a mild PLT
decrease was found only in four out of 93 non-ICU patients who received heparin, while the lowest
number was 50-117×109/L (figure S1B). A progressive PLT decrease to a level around 50×109/L was
observed in only one of these four patients. These findings indicate that heparin exposure may be a risk
factor for severe COVID-19.
High risk of HIT in critical COVID-19 patients
Heparin exposure is correlated with the severe thrombocytopenia, suggesting that HIT might be
responsible for severe thrombocytopenia in COVID-19. To substantiate this hypothesis, HIT antibodies
against heparin-PF4 complexes, a marker of HIT, were analyzed using an ELISA kit. Higher levels of
HIT antibodies were detected in the available sera from 14 COVID-19 ICU patients (sera from all ICU
patients were always unavailable due to death or discharge), but not in mild COVID-19 patients,
convalescent COVID-19 patients, or healthy people (figure 4A). To our surprise, an elevated HIT
antibodies level was also observed in some of these ICU patients before CRRT implementation, or
before heparin exposure in non-CRRT patients, suggesting that heparin pre-exposure was not absolutely
required to induce HIT in critical COVID-19 patients (figure 4B). Accordingly, among 11 heparin-naïve
nonsurvivors, seven patients experienced a progressive decrease in PLT, and four of them had a PLT
decrease of more than 50% (figure 4C).
Consistent with the elevated HIT antibodies, complement activation shown by C3a accumulation
was also observed in these patients (figure 4D). The concentration of serum HIT antibodies was largely

correlated with C3a levels (figure 4E). It has been reported that the release of heparin from master cells
could be induced by complement activation, which may indicate the potential role of endogenous
heparin in spontaneous HIT after viral infection.22,23 Moreover, as reported by other studies, a higher
percentage of neutrophils was observed in nonsurviving critical COVID-19 patients, which may further
contribute to the severity of HIT, but not in surviving critical COVID-19 patients (figure 4F and
S1D).10,24 In addition to laboratory tests, venous and arterial complications, including deep venous
thromboembolic complications, were observed in patients who died of COVID-19 by autopsy.25 Among
three nonsurviving ICU patients who received an autopsy, hyaline thrombus and other thrombi were
found in patient P12, who showed a progressive decrease in PLT. Bleeding in lung tissues but no
thrombi were observed in patient P17 with constantly low PLT counts (figure S1A). Furthermore, no
obvious bleeding or thrombi occurred in patient P5, who had a significant decrease in PLT counts, but
the lowest point was well above 100×109/L. Confirmed vein thromboembolism (VTE) in ICU COVID19 patients by CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or ultrasonography was also reported recently.26
Although the platelet activation assay was not performed because of the limited capacity of
Huoshenshan Hospital, current results still strongly suggested that HIT or spontaneous HIT, induced by
the virus or a secondary bacterial infection, may occur in COVID-19, which would be significantly
boosted and aggravated by further heparin exposure with a high dose, thereby resulting in a fatal
outcome.
Discussion
Severe thrombocytopenia and thrombosis-induced systemic clotting in severe and critically ill
COVID-19 patients resulted from complicated factors that greatly enhanced the risk of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection may directly lead to endothelial damage, thereby triggering platelet
activation and aggregation, a coagulopathy mechanism similar to that reported for SARS-CoV.27
Moreover, the serious complications of COVID-19 also result in elevated levels of D-dimer,28 a fibrin
degradation product that indicates DIC, and antiphospholipid antibodies, an autoantibody that induces
thrombi in large veins and arteries.29 All these factors contribute to increased platelet consumption and
eventually thrombocytopenia.
Here, we show that HIT occurred frequently in severe COVID-19 patients who received heparininvolved therapy, or were heparin-naïve (as spontaneous HIT). The widely used diagnostic criteria of
HIT include: 1) HIT antibodies to complexes of heparinoid (heparin or similar glycosaminoglycans) and
PF4; 2) HIT antibodies-mediated platelet activation; 3) a progressive PLT decrease of at least 40-50% or
more from baseline; 4) onset of thrombocytopenia occuring within five to ten days after initiation of
heparin or 24 to 48 hours after heparin re-exposure; and 5) thrombosis in patients treated with
heparin.20,30,31 In this study, severe thrombocytopenia (PLT<50×109/L), a >50% of PLT decrease, rapid
decrease upon CRRT treatment (high level of heparin exposure), high levels of HIT antibodies, and
venous, arterial and even deep venous thrombi in patients who died of COVID-19 basically fits the
clinical definition of HIT. Notably, HIT antibodies and a progressive decrease in PLT were also detected
in heparin-naïve patients (i.e., before CRRT or other heparin exposure), even in non-ICU patients (figure
4B), indicating the occurrence of spontaneous HIT in COVID-19 patients, which probably results from
virus itself or a secondary bacterial infection, such as PF4-conjugated Staphylococcus aureus or
Escherichia coli, or severe tissue damage.18 Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), an autoimmune
disorder similar to HIT, has been reported in HKU1 coronavirus infected patient.32 In non-ICU patients,
a progressive PLT decrease is rarely occurred, either because of the less severe viral and secondary
bacterial infection or the far lower level of heparin exposure, since heparin was primarily administered
for flushing the central venous catheter but not for prevention blood clots and treatment of venous
thrombosis in ICU patients. The moderate PLT decrease in non-ICU patients with HIT is transient and
can be recovered during convalescence. Although a protective effect of heparin-involved anticoagulation
in severe COVID-19 has been reported by Tang et al.,33 the potential risk of HIT should be cautioned
when it’s used to treat critical ICU patients with a high dosage.
Our findings strongly indicated the occurrence of HIT in severe COVID-19, although current
evidence did not fully meet the rigorous definition of spontaneous HIT proposed by Warkentin et al.20
because of the limited medical and laboratory capacity in de novo established Huoshenshan Hospital for
COVID-19 patients. The platelet serotonin-release assay (SRA) for highly pathogenic HIT in sera
containing both heparin-dependent and heparin-independent platelet activation antibodies, should be
performed later, which will provide more solid evidence of HIT in COVID-19.34
In patients with HIT, anti-heparin-PF4 IgG could be generated as early as the first day of heparin
treatment, indicating a preimmunization by antigens highly similar to heparin-PF4 complexes. This

preimmunization may be resulted from spontaneous HIT. For preimmunized patients, subsequent
exposure to a high dosage of heparin in anticoagulation therapy, such as CRRT and coagulation control,
will significantly boost the preformed B cells via a lot of heparin-PF4 complexes, thereby prompting the
activation and consumption of platelet, resulting in progressive thrombocytopenia and extensive
coagulation in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. This may explain the high mortality in critically ill
patients receiving CRRT (93·8%, 15/16). As an important supportive treatment for critically ill patients
with sepsis or AKI, CRRT is used to efficiently remove proinflammatory mediators accumulated in the
blood and maintain fluid balance in hemodynamically unstable patients,35 which has been recommended
for renal failure and renal replacement therapy in the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19.36
However, accumulating clinical data showed that there were nearly no survivors among critical COVID19 patients who received CRRT treatment, indicating that patients did not benefit from CRRT.6,8,11 Here,
we show that serious HIT may be responsible for the high fatality of CRRT in critical COVID-19
patients. Therefore, we suggeste that the clinical occurrence of HIT in COVID-19 patients, especially
critical patients, should be detected and monitored carefully. For those COVID-19 patients strongly
suspected of having HIT, the physician should stop all heparin-involved therapy and initiate an
alternative anticoagulant other than heparin, such as platelet aggregation inhibitor prostacyclin, direct
thrombin inhibitors (e.g., lepirudin), nonheparin glycosaminoglycan with anti-factor Xa activity (e.g.,
fondaparinux), or regional citrate anticoagulation, to avoid the risk of HIT-induced thrombosis in
COVID-19 patients.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Severe, progressive thrombocytopenia in nonsurviving COVID-19 patients in the ICU.
(A) Day-by-day variations of platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, and neutrophils percentages in six
nonsurviving patients (P1-P6) during ICU admission are shown. Treatments with tocilizumab,
transfusion, CRRT, and heparin exposure is labeled in the figure. PLT, platelet (×109/L); HGB,
hemoglobin (g/L); Neut%, neutrophils percentage; TCZ, tocilizumab treatment; CRRT, continuous renal
replacement therapy; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin treatment; RBC, red blood cells; FFP,
fresh frozen plasma. (B) Platelet count ranges (×109/L) in 15 surviving and 46 nonsurviving COVID-19
patients. The percentage of patients with each platelet counts range is shown in the figure. (C) Platelet
count decrease of each patient was calculated by (PLT#(admission day)-PLT#(the last day))/PLT#(admission
day)*100%. The percentage of surviving or nonsurviving COVID-19 patients with a >50% decrease of
platelet is shown in the figure. The data is shown as mean ± SEM and analyzed using a two-tailed
Student’s t-test. Differences were considered significant at **P<0·01, as indicated.
Figure 2. Platelet counts in 14 surviving ICU patients without CRRT treatment. (A) Day-by-day
variations of PLT#, HGB, and Neut% in 5 surviving patients without CRRT treatment (P48-P52) during
ICU admission is shown in the figure. Treatments are labeled as in figure 1A. (B) The trend lines of dayby-day platelet count in other surviving ICU patients without CRRT treatment (P53-P61).
Figure 3. CRRT treatment induces severe thrombocytopenia and death in critical COVID-19
patients. (A) The trend lines of day-by-day platelet count variation in CRRT-treated patients (P7-P15).
P15 is the only surviving patient. (B) The average platelet counts before (1 day before or the same day
as CRRT) and after (the last available data before death) CRRT. (C) The decrease percentage of platelet
count in COVID-19 patients treated with or without CRRT. The average PLT decrease and the
percentage of CRRT or non-CRRT treated patients with a >50% decrease of platelet is demonstrated. (D)
The decrease percentage of platelet count in recovered (surviving) or dead (nonsurviving) COVID-19
patients without CRRT treatment. The average PLT decrease in surviving or nonsurviving patients is
demonstrated. (E) Survival rate in COVID-19 patients treated with or without CRRT or heparin. The
data are presented as the mean ± SEM and were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Differences
were considered significant at **P<0·01, as indicated.
Figure 4. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in critical COVID-19 patients. (A) Level of heparinPF4 complexes antibodies (HIT antibodies) in serum of critical patients (ICU), severe patients (nonICU), convalescent patients (recovered non-ICU) and healthy controls. (B) HIT antibodies levels in
patients before CRRT (CRRT patients) and nonsurviving patients without CRRT or other heparin
exposure. (C) PLT decrease in nonsurviving COVID-19 patients without CRRT, with or without heparin
exposure. (D) As in (A), serum C3 levels were determined. (E) The correlation between the level of HIT
antibodies and C3a is fitted by a regression line with R2=0·87544. (F) Neutrophil percentage among
white cells in survivors and nonsurvivors is shown. The data are presented as the mean ± SEM and were
analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Differences were considered significant at **P<0·01,
***P<0·001, as indicated.
