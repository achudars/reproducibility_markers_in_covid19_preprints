ABSTRACT

67

Background: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may protect from reinfection and disease,

68

providing the rationale for administration of plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

69

antibodies (nAb) as a treatment for COVID-19. The clinical factors and laboratory assays to

70

streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely

71

understood. Methods: Adults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a

72

convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike

73

protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. Results: Amongst 250 consecutive persons

74

studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or

75

more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers ≥1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer

76

included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR

77

2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease

78

severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating

79

characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that

80

corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb

81

titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart

82

(P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.

83

Conclusions: Nab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard

84

commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing.

85

Functional nAb levels were found to decline and a small proportion of COVID-19 survivors lack

86

adaptive immune responses.

INTRODUCTION

89

Since its emergence in late 2019, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-

90

CoV-2) infection has spread globally, with devastating effects in many communities. At this

91

time, no vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection have

92

been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Passive immunotherapy with

93

convalescent plasma, hyperimmune gamma globulin, or monoclonal antibodies is beneficial for

94

treatment or prophylaxis of several infections(1), and these approaches are under investigation in

95

patients with COVID-19. Both single donor and pooled immunoglobulin products currently

96

prioritize collection of convalescent donor plasma with high levels of neutralizing antibodies

97

(nAb).

98
99

NAb assays are challenging to perform and have biosafety concerns. A better understanding of

100

the predictors and correlates of high nAb titers could be useful for improving access to high

101

quality therapeutic plasma products. In addition, it is uncertain how durable acquired immunity

102

will be in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Protection from several other respiratory viruses

103

after natural infection is temporary and incomplete(2, 3) and longitudinal information concerning

104

nAb levels may assist modeling the future of the outbreak until effective vaccines become widely

105

used. We evaluated antibody levels in candidate plasma donors recovered from virologically-

106

documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and examined the trajectory of antibody levels in a subset of

107

donors over time. Further, we compared nAb titers with two rapid commercially available assays

108

to determine whether these assays could substitute for time- and labor-intensive nAb

109

measurements that require a BSL-3 facility.

RESULTS

111

Participant characteristics

112

We enrolled 250 consecutive persons interested in convalescent plasma donation with a median

113

age of 51 years (range 19-91); 48% were men (Table 1). The median duration of COVID-19

114

symptoms was 15 days (range 0-49), and the median number of days between positive PCR

115

testing and initial antibody testing was 61 days (range 14-112). Eighteen (11%) of participants

116

reported hospitalization including 9 (4%) who received ICU-level care. The most common

117

symptoms reported were fatigue (86%), fever (74%), muscle aches (73%), cough (72%),

118

anosmia/ageusia (61%), and headache (60%) (Supplemental Figure 1A). The most commonly

119

reported underlying comorbidities were lung disease (14.4%), heart disease (13.6%),

120

hypertension (12.8%), cancer (12.8%), hyperlipidemia (9.6%), and diabetes (9.6%)

121

(Supplemental Figure 1B).

122
123

Clinical correlates of neutralizing antibody response

124

Among the 250 participants, 12.8% had nAb titers below 1:40, 27.6% had titers of 1:40, 34.4%

125

had titers of 1:80, and 25.2% had titers of 1:160 or greater (Figure 1). Next, we examined the

126

clinical correlates of nAb titers of 1:80 or greater, as this group was eligible for donation to a

127

pooled immunoglobulin product protocol. In a univariable analysis, older age (OR 1.04 per year,

128

95% CI 1.02-1.06), male sex (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.35-3.82), the presence of fever (OR 3.12, 95%

129

CI 1.73-5.61) or difficulty breathing (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.26-3.54) during the acute illness

130

episode, hospitalization denoting more severe disease (OR 9.98, 95% CI 2.31-43.16), and having

131

diabetes (OR 5.36, 95% CI 1.55-18.48) were significantly associated with higher nAb titers

132

(Table 2). In a multivariable analysis, older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03 [95% CI 1.00-1.06]),

133

male sex (AOR 2.08 [95% CI 1.13-3.82]), the presence of fever during the acute illness episode

134

(AOR 2.73 [95% CI 1.25-5.97]), and hospitalization (AOR 6.59 [CI 1.32-32.96]) remained

135

significantly associated with higher nAb titers (Table 2). A longer interval in time between the

136

diagnostic PCR and antibody testing was also associated with lower nAb titers (OR 0.97 [CI

137

0.96-0.99]) (Table 2).

138
139

Comparison of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements

140

Circulating IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens were measured using IgG

141

immunoassays for anti-S1 (Euroimmun) and anti-NP (Abbott). Amongst the 250 sera analyzed at

142

the initial time point, 23 (9.2%) of samples were negative by the manufacturer’s criteria versus

143

11 (4.4%) by a z-score threshold of 3.0 for the Abbott assay. For the Euroimmun assay, 20

144

(8.0%) were negative by a z-score threshold of 3.0 versus 30 (12.0%) by the manufacturer’s

145

criteria. A minority of samples demonstrated discordant results (Figure 2); overall, 15 (6%) were

146

discordant for seropositivity using z-score thresholds of 3.0 versus 19 (7.6%) using

147

manufacturers’ thresholds.

148
149

Quantitative assay results were generally concordant. Neutralizing antibody titers correlated with

150

z-scores from the anti-S1 Euroimmun assay (Pearson correlation of 0.49, P<0.001) and with the

151

Abbott anti-NP assay (Pearson correlation of 0.39, P<0.001) (Figure 2A, B). Z-scores of the

152

Euroimmun and Abbott assays also correlated with each other (Pearson correlation of 0.69,

153

P<0.001) (Figure 2C). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to

154

summarize the sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott and the Euroimmun assays for detecting

155

nAb titers ≥ 1:40, ≥ 1:80 and >1:160 (Supplemental Figure 2). The area under the curve (AUC)

156

for the Euroimmun assay was slightly greater than for the Abbott assay across all three nAb

157

levels.

158
159

The criteria for positivity in the binding IgG tests was subjected to further analysis focusing on

160

nAb cutoffs of ≥ 1:80 or higher. A z-score of 3.0 in the Euroimmun assay had a sensitivity of

161

99% and specificity of 17% for a nAb titer ≥ 1:80 (Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 2B). To

162

estimate optimal cutoffs, we used Youden’s index(4), which indicated that at an optimized z-

163

score cut-off of 34.2, the Euroimmun assay had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 72%. A z-

164

score of 3.0 in the Abbott assay had a sensitivity of 100% but a specificity of only 11%. Using an

165

optimized z-score cut-off of 32.6, the Abbott assay had a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of

166

81%. Because the optimal therapeutic titer of convalescent plasma is unknown, we also

167

calculated the sensitivity and specificity of both IgG binding assays to predict nAb titers ≥ 1:160;

168

as expected, these z-scores were higher (Table 3).

169
170

Antibody titers over time after recovery from COVID-19

171

Lower nAb titers were associated with a longer time after symptom resolution according to our

172

multivariable analysis (Table 2). In a cross-sectional visualization of serologic data from persons

173

with a nAb titer of 1:40 or greater at the initial blood draw, nAb titers, anti-S1 IgG, and anti-NP

174

IgG levels all demonstrated trends towards lower antibody levels with increased interval between

175

symptoms and blood sampling (Supplemental Figure 3). To further investigate this initial

176

observation, 41 participants enrolled during April 2020 who had nAb titers of 1:40 or greater

177

returned for a second blood draw to examine antibody kinetics. Neutralization titers decreased

178

over time in all but four participants. From these data, nAb half-life was calculated at 66.2 days

179

(95% CI 55.5-82.5) (Figure 3A). A decline in anti-S1 IgG and anti-NP IgG levels over time was

180

also observed in 83% and 98% of participants, respectively (Figures 3B and 3C). Given our

181

observation that compression of ODRs and resultant z-scores occur at higher levels of IgG, half-

182

life calculations were not performed for these latter assays.

183
184

Clinical characteristics and repeat serologic results from seronegative participants

185

We identified seven participants who lacked circulating antibody responses by all three assays,

186

despite having documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Amongst these, one had been asymptomatic

187

and one had been hospitalized for COVID-19 (Table 4). Five (71%) were women with a median

188

age of 48 (range 40-62). The median time between positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody

189

testing was 42 days (range 30-87). The previously hospitalized participant with consistently

190

negative antibody results across all three antibody tests had received infliximab for vasculitis one

191

week prior to becoming infected with H1N1 influenza, followed one week later by infection with

192

SARS-CoV-2. Six seronegative participants had a repeat blood draw, a median time of 43 days

193

(range 20-55) after the first. Serologic test results remained negative in all individuals by all

194

three assays (Table 4).

195
196

To further investigate the immune status of the seronegative individuals, we performed IFN-γ

197

ELISPOT using PBMCs from follow-up samples of the six persons with repeat blood draws, and

198

peptides from SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Previous work has shown that the majority of T

199

cell responses in COVID-19 survivors recognize these viral proteins(5). As comparators, we

200

tested a subset of seropositive persons and pre-2019 healthy donors. We detected robust T cell

201

responses in convalescent PBMCs from convalescent SARS-CoV-2-seropositive individuals,

DISCUSSION

206

Our characterization of a large cohort of potential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors

207

provides several useful observations relevant to protection after natural infection or vaccination

208

and the manufacture of antibody-based therapeutics. We found that a significant proportion

209

(40%) of persons failed to meet a protocol-driven nAb threshold (≥ 1:80) for contribution to a

210

pooled immunoglobulin product. Clinical factors associated with higher levels of nAb,

211

specifically male sex, older age, higher disease severity, and shorter interval from recovery, were

212

identified; this information could streamline future donor recruitment. Repeat testing

213

demonstrated a decline of functional nAb over time, suggesting that these clinical characteristics

214

are most valuable when used early after recovery. We also found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG

215

results from two widely accessible and commercially available immunoassays could reliably

216

predict high nAb titers when used relatively early after COVID-19. Test cutoffs were

217

empirically derived that can assist in selecting donors with increased likelihood of having high

218

nAb titers. Finally, approximately 3% of our cohort, all with documented SARS-CoV-2

219

infection, did not exhibit adaptive immune responses in multiple antibody and T cell assays.

220
221

Pending full approval of antiviral drugs or a preventative vaccine, much effort has focused on

222

passive immunization for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, ranging from single-donor

223

plasma and pooled immunoglobulin products to recombinant antibodies(6-8). Pooled products

224

have a track record of safety and efficacy for other pathogens including respiratory viruses(1),

225

and are most efficiently manufactured from plasma containing higher amounts of functional

226

antibody. While the immunoglobulin isotypes and functional activities associated with improved

227

COVID-19 outcomes remain an active area of investigation(9), neutralization of viral entry is

228

thought to be a desirable attribute that corresponds to protection. Thus, qualifying plasma

229

donation for NIH hyperimmune globulin protocol NCT04344977 has focused on high nAb titers.

230

Observational data from a single donor plasma program generally support the premise that

231

neutralizing antibodies are desirable, with lower mortality rates noted for persons receiving

232

plasma containing the top quintile of anti-S binding antibodies(6). A small randomized

233

controlled trial also found a trend towards a shorter time to clinical improvement and lower

234

mortality with convalescent plasma(10). We therefore sought to identify clinical characteristics

235

associated with plasma neutralizing antibodies and compared two widely used SARS-CoV-2

236

antibody tests for ability to predict nAb titers of 1:80 or greater.

237
238

Our clinical findings of an association between higher nAb titers with male sex, older age, and

239

hospitalization are consistent with a recent report from another convalescent plasma candidate

240

donor study(11) and other reports concerning recovered individuals(12-14). The relationship

241

between greater infection severity, and presumably greater antigen load, with higher acquired B

242

cell responses is paralleled by data by others showing an association between more severe

243

infection with higher T cell responses in general, and, in particular, circulating CD4+ T follicular

244

helper (cTFH) responses(15). TFH cells provide critical positive signals to antigen-specific B cells

245

in lymph node germinal center (GC) reactions promoting avid and long-lasting antibody

246

responses.

247
248

Our cross-sectional analyses also found a trend towards lower nAb titers with increased elapsed

249

time between antibody testing after symptom resolution. This was confirmed in longitudinal

250

analyses of 41participants re-evaluated approximately 3 months after their first test. A quarter of

12

251

the re-evaluated participants had nAb titers below 1:40 at the second time point, and declines in

252

circulating anti-S1 and anti-NP IgG levels were found in >80% of participants over the relatively

253

short period of time between the two blood draws. A critical and currently unresolved issue for

254

SARS-CoV-2 infection is the extent to which prior infection prevents or ameliorates various

255

characteristics of re-infection, including disease, viral shedding, and transmission potential. It is

256

likely that protection efficiency will vary according to clinical characteristics of the host and of

257

the initial infection, with time after initial infection, and with the virologic or clinical endpoint

258

under consideration. The issue of antibody durability has been addressed in prior cross-sectional

259

and longitudinal studies, obviously limited by the recency of the pandemic. Decreases in SARS-

260

CoV-2 nAb titers have been observed in some prior studies(13, 16, 17) but not others(18). The

261

decline of nAb titers over time and the low somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes

262

recovered from SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells(19) both suggest that ineffective help

263

from TFH CD4 T cells is occurring in germinal centers. While circulating TFH-like SARS-CoV-2-

264

reactive CD4 T cells have been detected in the blood(15), autopsy data from fatal COVID-19 is

265

consistent with poor germinal center reactions(20). Overall, waning immunity after natural

266

infection raises concern for re-infection over time as observed for other respiratory viruses,

267

including the endemic coronaviruses(2, 3). Data on protection from re-infection with SARS-

268

CoV-2 are incomplete at this time, with case reports of re-infection(21) contrasting with cohort

269

data from an occupational outbreak in which persons with baseline SARS-CoV-2-specific

270

circulating antibody were protected from infection(22). Additional research will be required to

271

address the immunologic and clinical parameters associated with protection from re-infection

272

after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

274

With regard to test performance, we found a slightly stronger correlation between nAb titers and

275

anti-S1 IgG levels using the Euroimmun assay compared to anti-NP IgG levels determined using

276

the Abbott assay. We were able to establish cutoffs using z-scores for each assay that had good

277

performance for predicting nAb titers of 1:80 or greater, or 1:160 or greater, which should be

278

useful as the clinical efficacy of single-donor and pooled immunoglobulin products continue to

279

be defined. The superior performance of the anti-S1 assay is not unexpected given that

280

antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 bind to the S protein present on the surface of infectious

281

virus. This finding is also consistent with studies that have shown that the detection of NP-

282

binding antibodies does not always correlate with the presence of nAb(23).

283
284

In the present study, we used z-scores to standardize serologic results to the same scale and to

285

account for local test performance characteristics(24). Despite using a relatively conservative

286

positivity threshold of 3 standard deviations above our assay-specific negative control means,

287

these z-score positivity thresholds were lower than manufacturer-recommended thresholds for

288

both assays. Accordingly, a larger number of samples were considered “negative” by both assays

289

using manufacturer-recommended thresholds compared to z-scores. Although continuous values

290

are obtained and accessible for both Abbott and EU assays, it is worth noting that both are EUA-

291

approved as qualitative and not quantitative assays. Although the Euroimmun assay appears to be

292

have a wider analytic range in comparison to the Abbott assay, both assays yield results that

293

plateau at different thresholds. Thus, values at higher levels for both assays would require

294

dilution of high-titer sera to achieve linear results. However, even in the absence of re-assay after

295

dilution, however, we were able to discern declines in binding IgG titers over time within-

296

subjects, similar to our observations for nAb.

297
298

A small proportion (3%) of participants tested negative on all three antibody assays despite

299

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in previously collected respiratory specimens. Each seronegative

300

COVID-19 survivor tested also had low T cell responses, similar to pre-2019 healthy controls,

301

while seropositive subjects had abundant interferon-gamma producing cells in the blood, similar

302

to other reports(25). While false positive PCR results are possible, all subjects except one, who

303

was a household contact of a person with symptomatic and PCR-confirmed COVID-19, had a

304

clinical syndrome consistent with COVID-19. Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients

305

with COVID-19 have been found to have lower antibody levels and also were more likely to

306

sero-revert in the early convalescent phase(14). Discordance between positive PCR and negative

307

circulating antibody may be related to timing of the blood draw after illness, milder symptoms

308

correlating with lower or briefer antigen exposure, and/or an unrecognized immune suppression.

309
310

Our study has some limitations. First, although our sample population included a clinically

311

diverse population with respect to age, sex, and clinical presentation, the cohort was

312

predominantly white. Additional studies in minority populations at risk for worse outcomes will

313

be needed to determine the generalizability of these results. Second, our study was mainly cross-

314

sectional, and longitudinal data were obtained on only a subset of the cohort. Third, in analyzing

315

the decline of neutralizing antibody titers, a titer of 1:20 was used as a surrogate for all titers

316

<1:40, since this value was the next serial 2-fold titer below the lowest positive result. We chose

317

this conservative surrogate value to avoid the possibility of over-estimating the rate of decline in

318

neutralizing antibody titers. Fourth, we focused on blood immune responses. It is possible that

319

the seronegative individuals in our study mounted a mucosal humoral or T cell response that

15

320

could provide protection against re-infection. Probing mucosal and T cell immunity may be

321

important in understanding the immune response of subjects with milder infection.

322
323

In summary, our data provide important information regarding the predictive value of clinical

324

factors and commercially available immunoassay results for high nAb titers. This information

325

could aid in streamlining the selection of potential convalescent plasma donors and increase

326

access to and efficiency of donor sample testing. Since transfusion of plasma with higher

327

antibody titers has been associated with improved outcomes(6), and since higher titer plasma is

328

the most suitable for the creation of pooled products, our data further suggest that plasma

329

donations should be sought closer to the resolution of symptoms, rather than later, to optimize

330

yield. A minimum level of nAb necessary for protection has not been established and it is

331

unknown whether persons with low titers will boost their immune responses upon re-exposure.

332

However, our data raise concern that functional antibodies show a quantitative decline over a

333

relatively short period of time after recovery in those with relatively mild infections. Further

334

insight into these issues is critical to monitoring herd immunity and implementation of

335

immunization programs.

METHODS

337

Study description

338

Seattle-area participants were recruited for potential donation of single donor plasma units

339

(NCT04338360), and plasma for manufacture of a pooled anti-SARS-CoV-2 product

340

(NCT04344977). Both studies required age 18 or greater and PCR-positivity to SARS-CoV-2;

341

criteria for donation for the pooled product also included a nAb titer of ≥ 1:80(26). Participants

342

provided demographic and clinical information, including positive SARS-CoV-2 results, and a

343

blood sample.

344
345

Serologic assays

346

Plasma from EDTA and heparinized blood and serum were prepared within 12 hours of

347

collection. Serum and plasma for IgG assays were stored at 4°C and assays performed within 72

348

hours of sample processing. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood within 12 hours of

349

phlebotomy using standard Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved in

350

liquid nitrogen in 90% fetal calf serum/10% DMSO. EDTA plasma was stored at -80°C for

351

neutralization assays.

352
353

Serologic testing was performed using two FDA-authorized (via Emergency Use Authorization),

354

CE-marked immunoassays; both are approved to provide qualitative results, although both yield

355

quantitative values. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA from Euroimmun (Lubeck, Germany)

356

measures antibodies to recombinant spike protein (S1 domain), containing the receptor binding

357

domain that interacts with ACE2(27). All testing and analyses were performed according to the

358

manufacturer’s protocols, with the OD ratio (ODR) calculated using the kit calibrator. The

17

359

manufacturer-provided reference range is as follows: ratio <0.8 (negative), ratio ³ 0.8 to <1.1

360

(borderline), and ratio ³ 1.1 (positive). The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent

361

microparticle immunoassay (Abbott ARCHITECT, Abbott Park, IL, USA) measuring antibodies

362

to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) was performed per the manufacturer’s instructions.

363

Equivalent to an ODR, the kit calibrator was used to establish the assay index result. Index

364

values ³ 1.4 are considered positive by the manufacturer.

365
366

To standardize results and facilitate comparisons, ODR scores for each sample were converted to

367

z-scores (number of SDs above the negative control mean) as follows: z-score = (Test ODR –

368

Mean negative control ODR) / Mean negative control standard deviation (SD)(24). Negative

369

control sera had been collected between 2015 and 2019 from healthy community blood donors

370

and from patients tested in the clinical laboratory by western blot for potential HSV infection

371

(N=78 for Euroimmun and N=136 for Abbott). ODR were converted to z-scores as follows: For

372

Euroimmun, z-score = (ODR – 0.26)/0.13 and for Abbott, z-score = (index result – 0.08)/0.14).

373

A conservative z-score ≥ 3 was considered positive to minimize false positive results.

374
375

Neutralizing antibody titers were performed using a fluorescence reduction neutralization assay

376

(FRNA) with authentic SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1-A12/2020 from the US Centers

377

for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) at the NIH-NIAID Integrated Research

378

Facility at Fort Detrick, MD, USA. In these experiments, a fixed volume of diluted virus was

379

incubated with an equivalent volume of test plasma for 1 hour at 37 °C prior to adding the

380

suspension to Vero E6 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA, #CRL-1586). The virus was allowed

381

to propagate for 24 hours prior to fixing the cells. Following fixation, the cells were

382

permeabilized and probed with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-specific rabbit primary antibody

383

(Sino Biological, Wayne, PA, USA, #40143-R001) followed by an Alexa594-conjugated

384

secondary antibody (Life Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA, #A11037). The total number of

385

infected cells in four fields per well with each field containing at least 1000 cells was quantified

386

using an Operetta high content imaging system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Plasma

387

was tested using two-fold serial dilutions from 1:40 to 1:1280 with four replicates per dilution.

388

Results are reported as the highest dilution of plasma leading to at least 50% reduction of SARS-

389

CoV-2 titers. Each assay was controlled with internal addition of an S-specific neutralizing

390

polyclonal antibodies. If a 1:40 dilution did not lead to at least 50% reduction of viral titer,

391

results were reported as <1:40 even though some inhibition of virus propagation may have been

392

present. To enable analysis of nAb kinetics over time, a value of 1:20 was used as a surrogate for

393

results <1:40 since this value was the next serial 2-fold titer below the lowest positive result.

394
395

T cell assays

396

To measure T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, PBMCs were thawed and plated at 2.5-3 X 105

397

cells/well in duplicate. Stimuli were 9 pools of SARS-CoV-2 peptides (Genscript, Piscataway,

398

NJ, USA) corresponding to the S, membrane (M), and NP proteins of SARS-CoV-2 strain

399

Wuhan (Genbank MN908947.3) in pools of 50-56 peptides/pool. Peptides 13 amino acids long

400

and overlapping by 9 amino acids were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL for each peptide

401

and 0.2% DMSO. Negative control was 0.2% DMSO; positive control was 1.6 μg/mL

402

phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P, Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA). Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ELISPOT

403

was performed as described(28). All subjects appropriately had too-numerous-to-count positive

responses to PHA. Results are reported as spot-forming units/106 PBMCs for the background-

405

subtracted response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools.

406
407

Statistics

408

Univariable analysis was performed using a t-test for continuous variables and Chi-square test

409

for categorical variables. Variables with P<0.2 in univariable analysis were candidates for

410

multivariable models using logistic regression and were retained in the models if they remained

411

significant or substantially modified the effect of another factor. Statistical significance was

412

defined as two-sided P<0.05. The sensitivity and specificity for high nAb titers by the Abbott

413

and the Euroimmun assays were plotted by generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

414

curve. SPSS software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis and to generate

415

ROC curves, the latter with default parameters. Youden’s index was calculated for all points of

416

the ROC curves, and the maximum index value was used to select the optimal z-score cut-off(4).

417

Longitudinal analysis of nAb levels was performed using linear mixed effects models with the R

418

package lme4(29).

421

Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the University of Washington and all
