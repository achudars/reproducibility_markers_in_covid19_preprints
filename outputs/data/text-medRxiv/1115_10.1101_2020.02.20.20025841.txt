We report the kinetics of the immune response in relation to clinical and
virological features of a patient with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19) requiring hospitalisation. Increased antibody-secreting cells,
follicular T-helper cells, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and IgM/IgG SARSCoV-2-binding antibodies were detected in blood, prior to symptomatic
recovery. These immunological changes persisted for at least 7 days following
full resolution of symptoms, indicating substantial anti-viral immunity in this
non-severe COVID-19.
On 30/01/2020, a 47-year old woman from Wuhan, Hubei province, China presented
to an emergency department in Melbourne, Australia. Her symptoms commenced 4
days earlier with lethargy, sore throat, dry cough, pleuritic chest pain, mild dyspnoea
and subjective fevers (Fig.1a). She had travelled 11 days prior to presentation from
Wuhan via Guangzhou to Australia. She had no contact with the Huanan seafood
market or known COVID-19 cases. She was otherwise healthy, non-smoker, taking
no medications. Clinical examination revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, pulse rate 120
beats/minute, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths/minute, and
oxygen saturation 98%, while breathing ambient air. Lung auscultation revealed
bibasal rhonchi. At presentation day (d) 4, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time
reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal
swab specimen. SARS-CoV-2 was again detected at d5-6 from nasopharyneal,
sputum and faecal samples, but was undetectable from d7 (Fg.1a). Blood C-reactive
protein was elevated at 83.2, with normal lymphocyte counts (4.3x109/L [range 4.012.0x109/L]) and normal neutrophil counts (6.3x109/L [range 2.0-8.0x109/L]). No
other respiratory pathogens were detected. Her management was intravenous fluid
rehydration without supplemental oxygenation. No antibiotics, steroids or antiviral
agents were administered. Chest radiography demonstrated bibasal infiltrates at d5,
which cleared on d10 (Fig.1b), and she was discharged to home isolation on d11.
Symptoms resolved completely by d13 and she remained well at d20 post-onset of
symptoms. Progressive increase in plasma COVID-19-binding IgM/IgG antibodies,
from d7 until d20 was observed (Fig.1c).
There are currently no data defining immune responses leading to viral clearance and
clinical resolution of COVID-19. We addressed this knowledge gap by analysing the
breadth of immune responses in blood prior to patient recovery. As antibody-secreting
cells (ASCs) are key for the rapid production of antibodies following viral Ebola
infection1,2, influenza virus infection and vaccination2,3; and activated circulating
follicular T helper (cTfhs) are concomitantly induced following influenza
vaccination3, we first determined the frequency of CD3-CD19+CD27hiCD38hi ASCs
and CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+ cTfh responses at 3 days prior to symptomatic
recovery. ASCs appeared in blood at the time of viral clearance at d7 (1.48%) and
peaked on d8 (6.91%). Emergence of cTfhs occurred concurrently in blood at d7
(1.98%), with the frequency increasing on d8 (3.25%) and d9 (4.46%) (Fig.2a). The
peak of both ASCs and cTfhs was markedly higher in the COVID-19 patient than the
baseline levels in healthy controls (average±SD: 0.61±0.40% and
1.83±0.77%, respectively, n=5). Both ASCs and cTfhs were still prominently present
at convalescence (d20) (4.54% and 7.14%, respectively; Fig.2a). Our study provides
evidence on the recruitment of both ASCs and cTfhs in patient’s blood whilst still

unwell and 3 days prior to resolution of symptoms, indicating their importance in
anti-viral immunity towards SARS-CoV-2.
Since co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR is well defined as the key phenotype of
CD8+ T-cell activation towards viral infections, we analyzed activation of CD8+ Tcells by CD38/HLA-DR co-expression. In accordance with previous reports on Ebola
and influenza1,4, CD38+HLA-DR+ co-expression on CD8+ T-cells rapidly increased
from d7 (3.57%) to d8 (5.32%) and d9 (11.8%), with a decrease at d20 (7.05%)
(Fig.2b). Furthermore, the frequency of CD38+HLA-DR+ co-expression on CD8+ Tcells in this patient was markedly higher than on CD8+ T-cells in healthy
individuals (1.47±0.50%, n=5). Similarly, CD38+HLA-DR+ co-expression increased
on CD4+ T-cells between d7 (0.55%) and d9 (3.33%) in the patient, compared to
healthy donors (0.63±0.28%, n=5), although at lower levels than CD8+ T-cells.
CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells, especially within CD8+ T-cells, produced higher amounts
of granzymes A/B and perforin (~34-54% higher) than their parent (CD8+ or CD4+
populations, Fig.2b). Thus, the emergence and rapid increase in activated
CD38+HLA-DR+ T-cells, especially CD8+ T-cells, at d7-9 preceded resolution of
symptoms.
We also analysed CD16+CD14+ monocytes, related to immunopathology, and
activated HLA-DR+CD3-CD56+ NK cells (Fig.2c). We detected reduced frequencies
of CD16+CD14+ monocytes in peripheral blood at d7-9 (1.29%, 0.43%, 1.47%,
respectively), compared to healthy controls (9.03±4.39%, n=5). This might indicate
efflux of CD16+CD14+ monocytes from blood to the site of infection, which remained
low at d20 (2.24%). Low levels of activated HLA-DR+CD3-CD56+ NK cells were
found in both the COVID-19 patient and healthy controls.
As high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines are predictive of severe
clinical outcomes for influenza5, seventeen pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines
were quantified in patient’s plasma. We found low levels of monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; CCL2), important for the recruitment of
monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells to the site of infection (Fig.2d). However, these
MCP-1 levels were similar to healthy donors (22.15±13.81, n=5), patients infected
with influenza A (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV) at d7-9 (33.85±30.12, n=5) and
a patient with a known human coronavirus infection HCoV-229e (hCoV, 40.56).
Substantial levels of RANTES (CCL5), involved in homing and migration of
activated T-cells that express CCR5, were also detected in COVID-19 plasma but
these were comparable to healthy donors (p=0.412), IAV/IBV-infected patients
(p=0.310) and a hCoV-patient. Thus, in contrast to severe avian H7N9 disease with
highly elevated IL-6 and IL-8, and intermediate IL-10, MIP-1β, IFN-γ5, minimal proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were found in this patient with CoVID-19, even
while symptomatic at d7-9.
Given that interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP)-rs12252-C/C was linked to severe influenza5,6, we analysed the
IFITM3- rs12252 SNP in this patient with COVID-19. Interestingly, the patient had
the ‘risk’ IFITM3-rs12252-C/C variant (Fig.2e), associated with clinical compromise
for 2009-pH1N16 and severe/fatal avian H7N9 disease5. As the relative prevalence of
IFITM3-rs12252-C/C risk variant in a healthy Chinese population is 26.5% (data
from 1,000 genome project)5, further investigations of the IFITM3-rs12252-C/C allele

in larger cohorts of patients with COVID-19 and its correlation with disease severity
is worth pursuing.
Collectively, our study provides novel contributions to the understanding of the
breadth of the immune response during a non-severe case of COVID-19. This patient
did not experience complications of respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, did not require supplemental oxygenation and was discharged within a
week of hospitalization, consistent with non-severe but clearly symptomatic disease.
We provide evidence on the recruitment of immune populations (antibody-secreting B
cells, follicular T-cells, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells), together with IgM-IgG
SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies, in patient’s blood prior to resolution of clinical
symptoms. We propose that these immune parameters should be characterised in
larger cohorts of patients with COVID-19 with different disease severity to
understand whether they could be used to predict disease outcome and to evaluate
new interventions to minimise severity and/or to inform protective vaccine
candidates. Furthermore, our study indicates that robust multi-factorial immune
responses can be elicited towards the newly-emerged SARS-CoV-2, and similar to the
avian H7N9 disease7, early adaptive immune responses might correlate with better
clinical outcomes.

QIAamp DNA Mini Kit, QIAGEN) to amplify the exon 1 rs12252 region using
forward
(5′-GGAAACTGTTGAGAAACCGAA-3′)
and
reverse
(5′CATACGCACCTTCACGGAGT-3′) primers2.
Cytokine analysis
Patient’s plasma was diluted 1:4 before measuring cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-1β, IFN-α, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1,
CD178/FasL, granzyme B, RANTES, TNF, IFN-γ) using the Human CBA Kit (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA). For RANTES, sera/plasma was also diluted
to 1:50. Healthy donors D6-D10 were of a mean age of 32 (range 22-55 years; 40%
females).
Whole blood staining and flow cytometry
Fresh whole blood (200μl per stain) was used to measure CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+PD1+
follicular T cells (Tfh) and CD3-CD19+CD27hiCD38hi antibody-secreting B cell
(ASC; plasmablast) populations as described3 as well as activated HLADR+CD38+CD8+ and HLA-DR+CD38+CD4+ T cells, inflammatory CD14+CD16+ and
conventional CD14+ monocytes, activated HLA-DR+CD3-CD56+ NK cells, as per the
specific antibody panels (Supplementary Table 1; gating strategy is presented in
Supplementary Fig.1). After the whole blood was stained for 20 mins at room
temperature (RT) in the dark, samples were lysed with BD FACS Lysing solution,
washed and fixed with 1% PFA. Granzymes/perforin staining (patient d20) was
performed using the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set after
the lysis step. All the samples were acquired on a LSRII Fortessa (BD). Flow
cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 software. Healthy donors D1-D5
were of a mean age of 35 (range 24-42 years, 40% females).
Detection of IgG and IgM antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 -infected vero cells
Immunofluorescence antibody tests for the detection of IgG and IgM were performed
using SARS-CoV-2-infected vero cells that had been washed with PBS and
methanol/acetone fixed onto glass slides. Ten μL of a 1/20 dilution of patient plasma
in PBS from days 7, 8, 9 and 20 were incubated on separate wells for 30 mins at
37°C, then washed in PBS and further incubated with 10μL of FITC-conjugated goat
anti-human IgG and IgM (Euroimmun, Lűbeck, Germany) before viewing on a
EUROStar III Plus fluorescent microscope (Euroimmun). Prior to detection of IgM
antibodies, samples were pre-treated with RF-SorboTech (Alere, Rűsselsheim,
Germany) to remove IgG antibodies and rheumatoid factors, which may cause falsenegative and false-positive IgM results, respectively.
