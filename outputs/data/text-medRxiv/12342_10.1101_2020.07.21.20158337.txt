Abstract
Quantitative real-time PCR methods have been used to perform approximately 278 million
tests for COVID-19 up to mid-July 2020. Real-time PCR involves a rate limiting step where
the samples are measured in situ during each PCR amplification cycle. This creates a
bottleneck limiting scalability and as a consequence reducing access to inexpensive reliable
testing at national and international scales. We investigated endpoint PCR for the qualitative
detection of SARS-CoV-2 sequences on synthetic RNA standards and hospital patient
samples. The endpoint PCR detection limit is constrained only by the stochastics of low copy
numbers and reliably detected single copies of synthetic RNA standards. On a set of 30
patient samples, endpoint PCR found one additional positive sample and was able to confirm
an indeterminate sample as negative. These results were found using 4 μl reagent and 1 μl of
sample representing an 80% reduction in required RNA extract input and PCR reagent
volumes relative to the NHS protocol (20 μl reagent and 5 μl sample). These results indicate
that endpoint PCR should be the method of choice for large scale testing programmes. Based
on the experience from ultra-high throughput genotyping efforts a single workflow using 384well plates has similar PCR capacity (250 Million) to that required for all testing done
worldwide during the first 7 month of the pandemic.

Introduction
COVID-19 has emerged rapidly from a few cases in Wuhan, China,1–3 to a global pandemic
caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is believed to have jumped to humans from an
animal host and is one of a host of betacoronaviruses affecting a wide range of animals.4–7
This family of pathogens was considered a pandemic threat before the current international
crisis began and has defied nearly all attempts to control or eliminate it due to a combination
of high infectiousness, undetected carriers and silent transmission.8–10 Improved mass scale
methods for detecting viral RNA would aid population surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and put
the world in a stronger position for fighting this and other viral diseases.

Real-time PCR is the current standard recommended by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) globally for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This was accepted under emergency
regulations in many countries and is now moving to more permanent status. This dominance
of testing emerged during the early stages of the pandemic via a WHO listing of diagnostic
protocols for COVID-19.11 At last update, this included seven protocols developed in China,
France, USA, Japan, Germany, Hong Kong, and Thailand targeting a range of SARS-CoV-2
sequences.11,12 Each protocol used real-time PCR reflecting the availability of instrumentation
and expertise in the labs creating the protocols. The universality of real-time PCR methods in
the early tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 created a preference in favour of this readout
method which has persisted.

Although real-time quantitative PCR is a standard method in diagnostic as well as research
labs and universities,13 it can be argued that real-time fluorescence signal reading and
monitoring is not always required for tests that require only a qualitative binary (Yes/No)
interpretation for both surveillance as well as diagnostic screening purposes. Industrial scale
qualitative PCR using rapid water-bath temperature cycling followed by endpoint readout was

described first in 1993 with a scale of 46,000 parallel reactions in 384-well plates.14,15 This
progressed to 1536-well formats by 200516 and capacity has since grown such that a single lab
using endpoint PCR can carry out 1.5 million PCRs per day at reasonable cost for
absence/presence SNP genotyping.17–19 A single 384-well plate industrial PCR system is
capable of 800,000 samples per day (146 M per 6 months) and with full 24/7 could exceed
this.

Endpoint PCR and low-cost reagent mixes underpin a cost-saving revolution in genetics such
that genotyping is now less costly than phenotyping.20–22 As an example, the KASP endpoint
assay system underpins hundreds of papers since 2019 (c.f.

19,22,23

). There have been

thousands of papers in the last decade proving the robustness of end-point PCR on over 400
genomes particularly for important food crops. Cost and performance comparisons have
appeared in the literature and industrial scale PCR cost has been well below US$1/data point
for several years and costs as low as US$0.064/data point documented.22–24 A similar cost and
scale revolution in SARS-CoV-2 testing would enable high-quality monitoring in even the
poorest of countries.

Scale limitations create a range of sampling, storage and processing issues. For example, false
negatives (FN) have been an ongoing problem with FN rates as high as 50% reported.25,26
With limited capacity, retesting of patients or samples is not always feasible. The ultra-high
throughput capabilities of endpoint PCR technologies provide an opportunity to correct this.
Further, at least in the UK, the cycle threshold and copy number values provided by real-time
PCR are not being used to inform clinical practice in any way and, to our knowledge, this is
true worldwide. Therefore, the extra unused information provided by real-time methods is
creating an unnecessary and costly bottleneck. Real-time PCR is providing the same Yes/No
result for the presence/absence of a short length nucleotide sequence that endpoint PCR can

provide at lower cost and higher throughput. Endpoint PCR has been demonstrated in forensic
science27 and for detection of other infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B,28 Ebola,29 and
HIV30 with some authors indicating endpoint methods are more sensitive than real-time.30

Here, we investigated endpoint PCR as an alternative to real-time PCR for COVID-19
(SARS-CoV-2 RNA) testing. We compare the two techniques on authentic positive samples
collected at Kent hospitals during the pandemic and report detection limits using hospital
patient samples and a dilution series using synthetic SARS-COV-2 sequences.

Materials and Methods
Sensitivity Standards.
Synthetic RNA controls containing nominally 106 copies/μl of the Twist Bioscience, Control
2 sequence (GISAID Wuhan-Hu-1; Genbank ID MN908947.3; Twist Bioscience) were
diluted to a starting concentration of 100,000 copies per

μl

using the mass information

provided by the manufacturer. Standards were prepared by serial dilution to obtain 10,000,
1,000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 copies per μl in 0.1mM Te (10mM Tris, pH 8.3, 0.1 EDTA).
These were tested using 2 μl aliquots using 10 replicates.
Samples and extraction.
A set of 30 anonymised combined nasopharyngeal & oropharyngeal samples collected from
patients presenting to Kent Hospitals Trust with COVID-19 symptoms were considered.
Using NHS in-house testing 19 of these samples were positive, 10 negative, and 1
indeterminate. All samples were extracted using either the Promega extraction kit or the
Abbott M2000 method. The ensuing Promega extracts underwent PCR by either GeneFinder
COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp Kit or the Viasure SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR Detection Kit.

The Abbott M2000 extracts were part of the single-flow closed extraction and PCR analyser
process. The specific extraction methods are described below:

Promega Extraction:
300 μl of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sample in Sigma Virocult® MW951S –
MWE (Medical Wire) collection medium was inactivated post-collection by adding 300 μl of
Promega Lysis Buffer (1:1). 30 μl proteinase K was added to 300 μl of the resulting solution
which was then extracted with Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega) giving 50

μl of sample for PCR tests.
M2000 Extraction:
500 μl of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sample in Sigma Virocult® MW951S –
MWE (Medical Wire) collection medium was combined with 500 μl of Promega Lysis Buffer
and 500 μl of the resulting solution was extracted with the M2000 extraction apparatus as
specified by the manufacturer resulting in 90 μl of RNA eluate for PCR tests.

The extracted RNA eluates were stored at -80°C prior to analysis.

PCR
The anonymised samples’ RNA eluates were tested using two protocols. First, the samples
were analysed using the Kent Hospitals diagnostic protocols. The Hospital RT-PCR
diagnostic protocols used GeneFinder RealAmp kit for RdRp (RNA dependent RNA
polymerase), E (envelope), N (nucleocapsid) sequences; Abbott RealTime SARS-C0V-2
Amplification Reagent kit for the RdRp and N sequences; and Viasure SARS-CoV-2 Real
Time PCR kit for orf1ab (open reading frame 1ab) and N sequences. The samples had no
specified pre-test selection in terms of which assay was used as all of the assays were

validated and verified to be of comparable performance criteria (sensitivity, specificity) set
against clinical as well as analytical external controls as part of a multi-option diagnostic
pathways for dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Hospital real-time PCRs:
Both the GeneFinder RealAmp PCR and the Viasure SARS-CoV-2 Real Time PCR assays
used 5

μl

of RNA eluate added to 20μl of respective assay’s detection mastermix which

then underwent PCR reaction in a 25 μl reaction (96-well plate).

The Abbott RealTime SARS-C0V-2 assay utilised 15 μl of RNA eluate from Abbott M2000
extraction added to 90μl of assay detection mastermix prior to real-time PCR in the Abbott
M2000 analyser.

Endpoint PCR:
The same RNA eluates from the 30 anonymised samples underwent endpoint PCR as follows.
1 μl of the RNA eluates were run in a final reaction volume of 5 μl of commercial RT-PCR
mastermix optimized to facilitate endpoint readout and containing 500 nM TMROX according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (ProbeSure™ Covid19 One Step RT-PCR endpoint mix;
COV-1010-1; 3Cr Bioscience). This mix contains primers and probes for the N1, N2 SARSCoV-2 genes and and RNaseP control using the sequences: (2019-nCoV_N1-Forward Primer

Results and Discussion
Sensitivity tests and standards
To test the sensitivity of the endpoint system replicate (N = 10) standards for each gene were
measured (Figure 1) giving 20 measurements per concentration. Of the 160 measurements,
one at 200 copies/well resulted in an indeterminate result due to a pipetting failure (no TMROX
was observed). No negative controls amplified. The N1 and N2 replicates gave

normalised values of 0.0501±0.0017 (N=10) and 0.1052±0.0032 (N = 10), respectively. We
considered any value further than 10 sd from the negative controls (0.07 and 0.14) to be
detected. Between 20-20,000 copies/well, the genes were detected in all cases except the
indeterminate well and formed a tight cluster distant from the negative controls (Figure 1a).

Below 20 copies/well, stochastic effects were seen such that the signal levels varied and, as
expected, copies were not detected in all wells (Figure 1b, 1c, and 1d). The 2 copies/well
standard amplified sufficiently to be detected in 13 out of 20 cases, 0.2 copies/well amplified
in 2 out 20 as did 0.02 copies/well. A simulation consisting of 10,000 repeats of 20 draws
from a Poisson distribution having means of 20, 2, 0.2, and 0.02 gave means of 20, 17.2, 3.62,
and 0.398 wells, respectively, for the number of wells expected to have at least one copy of
the sequences. This was in reasonable agreement the 20, 13, 2, and 2 wells with detected
genes. The lowest concentration is high relative to the expected mean; however, our
simulation gave 2 or more amplifications in approximately 6% of the 10,000 trials. The
variability expected from a Poisson process under these conditions can be seen in the
histograms produced by the simulations (Figure 1e). These results indicate that the endpoint
PCR strategy can detect SARS-CoV-2 genes with excellent sensitivity down to levels where
variability is dominated by the stochastics of single copies. The quality of the data makes
detection of the genes straightforward and well suited to either manual or automated analysis.

above the negative control) gives very high confidence that a positive sample has been
detected in the hospital samples (Figure 2). This yields a simple yes/no answer. Although the
positive samples were slightly lower than the positive controls, they form a tight readily
interpretable cluster far away from the negative samples and negative controls. This is a

feature of reagent mixes suited to endpoint PCR because they are designed such that the
fluorescence intensity reaches the same level independent of the input RNA concentration.
This results in simple interpretation that can be easily automated for large scale screening or
done manually.

To demonstrate the endpoint method, a set of samples were evaluated that had been
previously measured in Kent Hospitals on patients presenting to hospital with COVID-19
symptoms. These samples were measured with RNase P as a positive control (Figure 2) and
read using both real-time PCR (Figure 3a and 3b) and endpoint PCR (Figure 3c) for the
SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 sequences in a reaction volume of 5 μl. The real-time PCR CT
values ranged from 12-37 and were comparable to those found by the NHS testing lab (CT
from 14-37) in a 25 μl reaction (96 well plate). The decisions when compared to the previous
results obtained in the Kent Hospitals Laboratory were nearly 100% concordant. One sample
found to be negative by NHS testing was positive for the N1 gene but not N2. This sample is

assigned as a positive. In addition, the indeterminate NHS sample was found to be negative.

Discussion and Conclusion
We demonstrated that endpoint PCR is an excellent method for detection of SARS-CoV-2
RNA from patient samples and synthetic standards. Its sensitivity and variability are limited
only by the stochastics of low copy numbers. It was able to detect an additional positive
sample and resolve an “indeterminate” result as negative. It provides a simplicity of readout
giving a clear yes/no answer while removing an equipment bottleneck in testing workflows.
This confirms previous work using endpoint PCR for other diseases. Endpoint PCR is
inherently more scalable because the thermocycling step is done in parallel prior to readout

rather than in situ. Real-time PCR limits instrument throughput by monitoring the increased
fluorescence as thermocycling takes place. As such, endpoint PCR should be the method of
choice for mass testing populations in hospitals, schools, factories, cities, and countries and is
readily adaptable to any disease where a sequence is known.

The real-time PCR methods currently in near universal use reflect the equipment and
methodology available in the labs that developed the tests for SARS-CoV-2. Real-time
methods have struggled to keep up with testing requirements and the widespread use of 96well plate technology is not the best use of valuable reagents under these conditions. Up to the
time of writing (15 July 2020), a total of 278,143,685 tests have been reported worldwide. A
single endpoint PCR workflow using 384-well plate formats operating 140 plates an hour 24/7
could have provided 220M (million) RNA PCR results over 198 days. This capacity estimate
is meant as an indicator of the scale that has been realised industrially on DNA on difficult
samples (plants). Two to three such platforms will give robustness and provide opportunity
for replicate analysis. Until vaccines are available or clinical interventions improve, finding
and isolating people with COVID-19 is the only way to fight the disease. Endpoint PCR can
realistically provide the PCR capacity needed at country scale and reasonable cost.

Existing real-time PCR labs can switch to endpoint PCR by switching chemistries while using
existing equipment which can be replaced as needed. Many countries and industrial
organisations may already have much of the required equipment lowering the overall costs
and the up-front cost of an installation with 800,000 sample/day capacity is circa £2.3 million.
This is insignificant in comparison to the growing loss of life and the economic damage done
by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even the richest countries will be unable to withstand further
extended periods of reduced economic activity leaving an impossible task balancing health
and economic hardship. Endpoint PCR methods can provide country scale PCR capacity for
