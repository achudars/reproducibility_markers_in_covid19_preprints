Abstract
As of March 13, 2020, Europe became the center of COVID-19 pandemic. In
order to prevent further spread and slow down the increase in confirmed cases and
deaths, many countries in European Union have taken some interventions since
mid-March. In this study, a metapopulation model was used to model the outbreak of
COVID-19 in Europe and the effectiveness of these interventions were also estimated.
The findings suggested that many countries successfully kept the reproduction
number ùëÖ ùë° less than 1 (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Spain, and France) while other
countries exhibited ùëÖ ùë° greater than 1 (e.g., United Kingdom, Cyprus). Based on the
assumed reopen strategy, this study also revealed that a 2-week delay in response
predicted approximately 2,000 deaths and 200,000 cases (daily peak value), while a
3-week delay predicted approximately 5,000 deaths and 600,000 cases (daily peak
value). Therefore, a quick response upon signs of a re-emerging pandemic in the
world is highly imperative to mitigate potential loss of life and to keep transmission of
Covid-19 under control.

Outbreak Dynamics

Introduction

On January 24, 2020, France reported the first case of COVID-19 and by March
17, all European countries had at least one confirmed case when Montenegro
confirmed a COVID-19 case [1]. As of March 13, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) considered Europe as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic
when the number of new reported cases and deaths became greater than those in
China [2]. On March 17th, the European Union closed all external borders and the
next day more than 250 million people were in lockdown across Europe along with
already prescribed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [3,4].
The NPIs for some European countries were summarized by Flaxman et al.,
(2020) who classified NPIs into five categories: lockdown, public events ban, school
closure, self-isolation, and social distancing recommendations [5]. These NPIs were
mainly implemented in mid-March 2020 for most European countries and they have
been proven successful in controlling the spread of COVID-19 pandemic by reducing
ùëÖùë° < 1 (Rt: Effective Reproduction Number, defined as the actual average number of
infectious individuals per infection at time t).
Recently, as the number of new reported cases and deaths decreased, many
European countries announced relaxation of NPIs and reopening of borders. In this
analysis, we aimed to estimate the effectiveness of NPIs in mitigating the spreading of
COVID-19 for countries in European Union and to model potential risks associated
with lifting NPIs.
Materials and methods
Source of Data
The spreading of COVID-19 was modelled through a mobility network of
passenger air travel. The first quarter of 2019 data were downloaded from Eurostat on
June 12, 2020 [6] and used to describe the inter-country mobility in the transmission
model. We drew the COVID-19 outbreak data of all 28 countries of the European
Union from the reported confirmed and death cases until June 16, 2020 [7].
Epidemiology Model
A metapopulation model was used to model the mobility between countries of
European Union as described by Ruiyun et al., (2020). In this model, besides to the
number of people who were S (susceptible), E (exposed), ùêºùëü (infected, documented),
ùêºùë¢ (infected, undocumented), the parameters were also included in this model as
described in Equation 1:

where,

ùëÖ ùë°: The effective reproduction number,
ÔÅ¢: Transmission rate due to documented infection population,
ÔÅ≠: Reduced factor of transmission rate for undocumented infection
population,
ÔÅ°: The fraction of documented infected by the total infected population,
Z: The average latency period, and
D: The average duration of infection.
To calibrate the transmission model against daily incidence and daily death,
EAKF (ensemble adjustment Kalman filter) and IF-EAKF (iterated filtering-EAKF)
were implemented for different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic [8,9]. In phase one,
defined as the time period from February 12, 2020 through March 2, 2020, the
IF-EAKF algorithm was used and its parameters were set as ùõΩ ‚àà [0.3,1.5] , ùúá ‚àà
[0.2,1.0] , ùëç ‚àà [2,5] , ùê∑ ‚àà [2,5] , ÔÅ° ‚àà [0.02,1.0], ÔÅ± ‚àà [0.01,10.0] . In phase two,
defined as the time period from March 3, 2020 through June 16, 2020, the EAKF
algorithm was implemented and its parameters were set as ùõΩ ‚àà [0.05,1.5] , ùúá ‚àà
[0.1,1.0] , ùëç ‚àà [2,5] , ùê∑ ‚àà [2,5] , ÔÅ° ‚àà [0.05,1.0], ÔÅ± ‚àà [0.01,1.0] . As there were many
outbreaks at the same time for European countries, the model was initiated by using
the same strategies described by Pei Sen et al., 2020. ùê∏ and ùêºùë¢ were randomly
drawn from uniform distributions [0,12ùê∂ ] and [0,10ùê∂] eight days prior to the
reporting date (ùëá0 ) of the first case. Here, ùê∂ was the total number of reported cases
between ùëá0 and ùëá0 + 4.
Reopening Strategy

The control measures were further relaxed on June 17, 2020 for all 28 countries.
ùëÖùë° for all countries were maintained with values higher than 1.5. For countries with
ùëÖùë° values lower than 1.5, the corresponding values were set as 1.5. The daily
incidence and daily death for six weeks were projected using the calibrated models
and after a response time of 2 or 3 weeks, a 25% weekly reduction of transmission
rates were assumed.

Results and Discussion
As seen in Table 1, the inferred parameters (¬±95% CI) were reported for the
best-fit model ranging from February 12, 2020 through March 2, 2020. The results
showed that only 6% of total infections were reported during this period. A high
proportion of infection population (94%) was not reported because of mild or
asymptomatic infections or due to low detection rate. Our result showed that those
undocumented infections were contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic with

approximately half the level of contagiousness (ÔÅ≠=0.52; 95%CI: 0.46, 0.58) which is
similar to the result reported by Ruiyun et al., (2020). Owing to no symptoms and
poor prevention awareness, most undocumented infections do not seek medical care.
Based on the reasons mentioned above, those undocumented infections facilitate the
rapid spread of COVID-19.
After March 2, 2020, many NPIs were implemented in European countries at
different dates. Therefore, the same ÔÅ¢ was not used for all 28 countries. The EAKF
algorithm was used to fit the daily incidence and death to estimate the R t values for
different countries (Figure 1). As seen in Table 2, many countries successfully kept
the ùëÖùë° value less than 1, (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Spain, France) while other
countries exhibited ùëÖ ùë° greater than 1 (ùëÖùë° > 1), (e.g., United Kingdom, Cyprus),
indicating insufficient control of the pandemic.
The estimated European ascertainment rate was declined from 0.2 to 0.06 in
mid-April with a rapid COVID-19 spread indicating that the increase of testing
capacity was insufficient to keep up with the increase in infections (Figure 2). Once
there was an observable decrease in cases in mid-April with increased testing capacity,
the ascertainment rate was increased back to its earlier levels (~0.2).
Furthermore, reopening and potential risks were also investigated. In this study,
an assumed NPI relaxation was modelled on June 17, 2020 for potential effects on
infections and deaths in these European countries. In these instances, the R t was
anticipated to be ‚â•1.5 for all countries, depending on the Rt prior to June 17 th. The
difference in COVID-19 impacts was specifically investigated if NPIs with 25%
efficiency were implemented each week following either a 2- or 3-week initial
response time delay. A 3-week response time to re-implement NPIs predicted large
numbers of confirmed infections and deaths (Figure 3). In the meantime, a 2 -week
delay predicted approximately 2,000 deaths and 200,000 cases (daily peak death),
while a 3-week delay predicted approximately 5,000 deaths and 600,000 cases (daily
peak death). Therefore, quick action upon signs of a re-emerging pandemic in these
countries was imperative to mitigate potential loss of life. Finally, it should be noted
that this model would support implementation of the most effective NPIs very early in
an effort to reduce Rt < 1 in these countries.
