Abstract
Objective: To describe the global academic response to COVID-19 during its early stages. The
responsiveness of investigators, editorial teams, and publishers was explored.
Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric review of COVID-19 literature. A parallel search of Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) literature was performed for comparison of outcomes.
Data sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The search for COVID-19 studies was
performed between 1st November 2019 and 24th March 2020. The search for MERS studies
was performed one year earlier between 1st November 2018 and 24th March 2019.
Main outcome measures: Investigator-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the
volume and type of published research. Editorial-responsiveness was assessed by measuring
the time from manuscript submission to acceptance and the availability of original data to
support the study results. Publisher-responsiveness was assessed by measuring the time from
manuscript acceptance to first publication and the provision of open access.
Results: In total, 398 of 2835 COVID-19 and 55 of 1513 MERS search results were eligible.
Most COVID-19 studies were clinical reports (n=242; 60.8%) and the majority of these were
case series (n=105; 43.4%) and single cases (n=65; 26.9%). The times from manuscript
submission to acceptance (median: 5 days (IQR: 3-11) vs 71.5 days (38-106); P<0.001) and
acceptance to publication (median: 5 days (IQR: 2-8) vs. 22.5 days (4-48.5-; P<0.001) were
strikingly shorter for COVID-19. Almost all COVID-19 (n=396; 99.5%) and MERS (n=55; 100%)
studies were available with open-access. Data sharing was infrequent, with original data
available for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 and 10 (18.2%) MERS studies (P=0.203).
Conclusions: The early academic response to COVID-19 was characterised by investigators
aiming to define the disease. These studies were made rapidly and openly available by
editorial and publishing teams. Data sharing practises are an essential target for improvement
as the pandemic progresses.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly since it began in the city of Wuhan in late
2019[1]. The outbreak has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation
(WHO), reflecting its spread to more than 200 countries worldwide[2]. As of April 2020, there
has been more than 100,000 deaths and the number of those affected continues to rise[3].
In response to this unprecedented situation, healthcare systems around the world have taken
urgent action to scale up medical staffing, equipment, and infrastructure. In the United
Kingdom (UK), this is demonstrated by the construction of new field hospitals, the return of
thousands of retired healthcare workers, and the re-purposing of many acute and urgent
hospital services[4]. The role that science and data play in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic
must also be recognised. Robust and rapidly-available evidence is essential for improving the
detection and treatment of the virus as well as for reducing its transmission. It is the
responsibility of all members of the academic community to facilitate this transfer of knowledge
so that patients around the world receive the best evidence-based care available.
There is limited information about how the academic community has responded to COVID-19
and how this can be further guided during times of global crisis. There is a need for
Investigators to respond urgently to new clinical needs across all sectors of healthcare and to
work in unfamiliar environments. Journal editors must facilitate rapid and robust peer review
whilst making difficult editorial decisions based on little previous academic background.
Publishers must mobilise quickly to enable timely publication of manuscripts so that research
outputs can be realised and implemented into practice. An early understanding of this
response is important so that the academic community can identify early challenges and
respond appropriately as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.

Methods
Ethics & Governance
As a review of published literature, approval by a research ethics committee was not
applicable. Since only bibliometric outcomes were considered, rather than outcomes of direct
relevance to research participants, this review was not eligible for registration on the
PROSPERO database. There were no changes to the research design or outcomes during
the course of the study. The results are reported with consideration to the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Checklist[5].
Aims & Objectives
The study aimed to examine the responsiveness of the academic community to COVID-19
during its early stages. The following objectives were predefined:
1. To explore investigator-responsiveness by describing the volume and type of research
accepted in peer-reviewed journals.
2. To explore editorial-responsiveness by describing the time taken to facilitate
editorial/peer review and the availability of original data as a condition of publication
3. To explore publisher-responsiveness by describing the time taken for accepted
manuscripts to be available and the provision of open access publication.
Study Design
This was a systematic, cross-sectional, bibliometric review of existing literature related to
COVID-19. To facilitate comparisons of outcomes in a unique setting, a comparable review of
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was also performed and used as a non-COVID19 control. MERS was chosen as a suitable comparator because it similarly represents a
respiratory illness caused by a zoonotic coronavirus, but was not classified as a pandemic or
a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO during the search period[6].

Definitions
In line with the WHO, COVID-19 describes the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and MERS describes the disease caused by the
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV)[7]. The early stages of
COVID-19 was defined as the period between the first known human case and its classification
as a pandemic on 11th March 2020[2]. Availability of original data was considered to be an
editorial responsibility since this is recommended by the International Committee of Medical
Journal Editors for clinical trials and can be enforced as a condition of publication[8]. Openaccess was defined by the model of Gold open-access, where articles and related content are
freely accessible at the point of publication. Fully open-access journals were defined by their
listing on the Directory of Open Access Journals (ttps://doaj.org).
Search Strategy
Systematic searches of MEDLINE (via OvidSP) and EMBASE (via OvidSP) were performed
by a single investigator on 25th March 2020. For COVID-19, time limits were set between 1st
November 2019 and 24th March 2020. This start date was chosen to represent the earliest
plausible time of the first human report. The end date reflected the official WHO classification
of COVID-19 as a global pandemic (11th March 2020) along with a 14-day lag period for
manuscripts already in production. For MERS, a comparable search was performed between
1st November 2018 and 24th March 2019. The difference in year was chosen to represent a
non-COVID-19 control period. The results of both searches were first deduplicated and saved
offline for inspection. Two independent investigators then screened titles, abstracts, and fulltexts for possible inclusion, with discrepancies addressed through re-examination and
discussion. A full outline of search strategies is available in Suppl. Table 1.
Study Eligibility Criteria
For published studies, any COVID-19- or MERS-related manuscript available online or in print
within the defined time periods was eligible for inclusion. Eligible studies had to report primary

data. This included studies which performed analyses using open source datasets, but not
studies which reported systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Studies of animals or pre-clinical
models were eligible, but only if the outcomes contributed to human rather than veterinary
medicine. Articles published in non-English languages and other grey literature (such as
conference abstracts) were excluded since these are not practically accessible by the global
academic community.
Study Outcomes
Academic responsiveness was considered across three groups of the academic community.
Investigator-responsiveness was explored by measuring the volume and type of research
(pre-clinical, clinical, modelling) published in peer-reviewed journals. Editorial-responsiveness
was explored by measuring the time taken for editorial/peer-review, defined as the number of
days between manuscript submission and acceptance. The availability of original data to
support the results was also explored. Data were considered available if individual
observations (or source code in the case of modelling studies) were provided as a
supplementary file, in a controlled-access repository, or if an explicit statement of availability
from authors was present. Where the status of data sharing was unclear, corresponding
authors were contacted and non-responses were considered to represent an absence of data.
Publisher-responsiveness was explored by measuring the time taken for manuscripts to
complete production, defined as the number of days between acceptance and first availability
online or in print. Publisher responsiveness was also assessed by exploring the incidence of
open access publication.
Data Collection
Data were collected by a single investigator and checked by an independent investigator for
accuracy. Data sources included full-text manuscripts and editorial-related content. Data
points of interest were country of origin (according to the corresponding institution), manuscript
format (short communication/letter or full-text), journal subject category, and subject category

ranking (according to Thomas Reuters Journal Citation Reports). For clinical studies,
additional data of interest were population (adults, children, pregnant adults, or healthcare
workers), study design (case report, case series, observational, or interventional) and clinical
focus (definition of disease, diagnosis/screening, treatment, prevention, or resource use).
Definition of disease related to studies describing clinical features and outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented descriptively using averages and measures of variance. Continuous data
were analysed using the student’s t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Categorical data
were analysed using χ2 or Fisher’s Exact test. All statistical comparisons of COVID-19 and
MERS studies were pre-planned. A single sub-analysis of data sharing practices was
performed with the exclusion of case reports since these may or may not provide the full
complement of data within the reported manuscript. The level of statistical significance was
set at P<0.05.

Results
Study Characteristics
Across both searches, 398 of 2835 COVID-19 search results and 55 of 1513 MERS search
results were eligible for inclusion (Figure 1 & Figure 2). The majority of COVID-19 studies were
authored from institutions in China (n=254; 63.8%) whereas the majority of MERS studies
were authored from the United States (n=14; 25.5%). A greater proportion of COVID-19
studies were published as letters or short communications (n=158; 39.7%) compared to MERS
(n=4; 7.3%). Infectious Diseases (n=117; 29.4%) and General & Internal Medicine (n=78;
19.6%) were the most common journal subject categories for COVID-19, with the majority
(n=248; 62.3%) of manuscripts published in the first quartile of category-specific rankings. In
contrast, the most common category for MERS studies was Virology (n=15; 27.3%) (Table 1).
Investigator Responsiveness
The first eligible COVID-19 study was reported on 21st January 2020. The volume of reports
increased rapidly during the early stages of the disease, with 23 published in January 2020
(5.8%), 169 in February 2020 (n=42.5%), and 206 in March 2020 (51.8%). This compared to
a median of 9 MERS studies per month (range: 5-20) published during the control period
(Figure 3). The majority of COVID-19 studies were clinical (n=242; 60.8%), followed by preclinical (22.6%), and modeling studies (15.6%). Case reports (n=65; 26.9%) and case series
(n=105; 43.4%) were the predominant designs for clinical studies and most of these set out to
define the disease (n=125; 51.7%). Almost all clinical studies explored general adult
populations (n=209; 86.4%), with a handful exploring other groups, including children (n=16;
6.6%), pregnant adults (n=7; 2.9%) and healthcare workers (n=10; 4.1%) (Table 2). In
contrast, MERS studies were mostly pre-clinical (n=37; 67.3%), followed by clinical (n=13;
23.6%), modeling (n=1; 1.8%) and other miscellaneous (n=3; 5.5%). MERS clinical studies
mainly comprised of case series and observational designs (both n=5; 38.5%) and most set

out to define the disease or explore issues of diagnosis/screening (both n=5; 38.5%). The
majority explored general adult populations (n=11, 84.6%).
Editorial Responsiveness
The time taken for editorial- and peer-review was available for 257 (64.6%) COVID-19 studies
and 52 (94.5%) MERS studies. The median time from submission to acceptance was much
shorter for COVID-19 studies (median: 5 days; interquartile range (IQR): 3-11) compared to
MERS (median: 71.5 days; IQR: 38-106) (P<0.001). The median time for COVID-19 short
communications was shorter than for full-texts (4 days, IQR: 2-7.5 vs. 6 days, IQR 3-13;
P<0.001), whereas no significant difference in time was found between study designs (case
report: 4.5, IQR 2-10 vs. case series: 5, IQR 2.25-10 vs. observational: 6, IQR 3-13; P=0.645).
Original data were available via a supplement, data repository, or through direct request from
the study authors for 104 (26.1%) COVID-19 studies compared to 10 (18.2%) MERS
(P=0.203). When case reports were excluded, data were available for 95 of 333 (28.5%)
COVID-19 studies and 10 out of 54 (18.5%) MERS studies.
Publisher Responsiveness
The time taken for production processes was available for 280 (70.4%) COVID-19 and 52
(94.5%) MERS studies. The median time from acceptance to first publication was significantly
shorter for COVID-19 (5 days, IQR: 2-8) compared to MERS (22.5 days, IQR: 4-48.5;
P=0.001). There was no significant difference in the time for production between letters/short
communications (median: 5, IQR: 1.5-8) and full-texts (median: 5, IQR: 2-8) (P=0.617). Neither
was there a significant difference in production time between study designs (case report: 5,
IQR: 3-8 vs. case series: 5, IQR 2-8 vs. observational: 5, IQR: 3-7.75) (P=0.954). A total of
396 (99.5%) COVID-19 manuscripts were available with open-access, including 275 (69.4%)
manuscripts published in hybrid journals (open-access not mandated). Unexpectedly, all 55
(100%) MERS manuscripts were also available with open access, including 26 (47.3%)

Discussion
The results demonstrate a rapid academic response to COVID-19 during its early stages.
Investigators initially responded with case reports and case series in an attempt to describe
the disease. These were highly published, often in major general medical or highly ranked
specialty journals. The volume of interventional studies exploring treatments was low, but this
is expected to change as ongoing trials reach completion. The editorial and production times
for COVID-19 studies were strikingly shorter compared to MERS controls and almost all
manuscripts were openly accessible at the point of publication. In contrast, only one-in-four
COVID-19 manuscripts were published with original data available to support the results.
During times of medical crisis and global disease, rapid dissemination of information is
essential to inform frontline treatments and prevention. This review provides an early insight
into the challenges of the COVID-19 academic response. Even from the early stages, it is
evident that data sharing practices are lacking and are a target for improvement as the
pandemic progresses. A key strength of this review is the ability to identify this promptly and
inform the study design, data management, and consent procedures of future research. A
weakness of the review is the incomplete representation of the research pathway. Whilst
investigators, editors, and publishers are essential for generating and disseminating research,
other groups such as funding bodies, research ethics committees, regulatory agencies, and
patient/stakeholder groups also play important roles. Measuring the response of these groups,
however, is challenging since it relies on data which are not openly available or straight
forward to measure. Another weakness is the focus on peer-reviewed publications. It is likely
that a wider body of unpublished data exist following editorial rejection or through investigators
making results available on non-peer reviewed platforms. These are important data, but it is
proposed that further work to confirm their rigor and stability (i.e. changes made during parallel
submission and peer-review) is required before wider consideration.
The academic response during times of global disease has been explored in the past. In a
bibliometric analysis of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis, the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081414; this version posted May 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

difference in median submission-to-acceptance intervals between SARS and non-SARS
articles was 106.5 days (95% CI 55.0 to 140.1) and the difference in median acceptance-topublication intervals was 63.5 days (18.0 – 94.1) [9]. In another bibliometric review of the West
African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), the academic response was shown to be organised
around a small number of individuals with extensive global networks. This demonstrated the
role and importance of strategic planning through international cooperation and expertise[10].
More recently, two early analyses of COVID-19 research found that most data were generated
from China and called for increased academic output, particularly in the form of interventional
trials of new treatments[11,12]. As suggested by the previous EVD response and the current
data, this must be done with global coordination and in the spirit of open science. As more
studies emerge during the COVID-19 pandemic, data sharing will be critical for allowing
scrutiny of results, reducing unnecessary duplication, and enabling rigorous pooled analyses.
This study raises important considerations for the dissemination of data during the COVID-19
pandemic. Firstly, the urgency for information and the need for rigorous peer review must be
balanced, particularly in studies that are controversial, preliminary, or practice-changing. Preprint publication is an alternative to fast-track editorial processes provided that audiences can
accept the lack of prior editorial review[13]. Secondly, open-access publication is essential so
that the global medical community can learn freely from each other. In this study, almost all
articles were available with open-access for both COVID-19 and MERS research. It is likely
that this represents and extended effort by publishers to share knowledge, since only 45% of
the scholarly literature in 2015 was published with open-access[14]. Finally, in an age of
electronic dissemination, it is clear that journals are not the only platform for reporting research
data. International bodies such as the WHO publish regular COVID-19 situation reports and
social media has emerged as a rapid source of knowledge transfer[3,15]. There remains a
need to balance pragmatic and timely dissemination of results (not just limited to academic
journals) with the assurances and validation brought by traditional peer-review.

There is no question that the academic response to COVID-19 from investigators, editors, and
publishers has been prompt. Data sharing is an early unmet challenge and a commitment
from all members of the academic community is required. Secure access data repositories
exist to facilitate this safely, as do guidelines for data stewardship and management[16]. As
the pandemic develops, it is likely that the anatomy of COVID-19 research will shift from efforts
to describe the disease towards efforts to treat and prevent it. As with previous global
diseases, a research agenda will be essential to ensure the global response remains
coordinated and relevant[17]. Further auditing of the academic response will be important so
that the academic community can identify and address new challenges as they emerge.
