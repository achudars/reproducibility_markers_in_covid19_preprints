ABSTRACT
Introduction
Risk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are defined but stratification of mortality
using non-laboratory measured scores, particularly at the time of pre-hospital SARS-CoV-2
testing, is lacking.

Methods
Multivariate regression with bootstrapping was used to identify independent mortality
predictors in a derivation cohort of COVID-19 patients. Predictions were externally validated
in a large random sample of the ISARIC cohort (N=14,231) and a smaller cohort from Aintree
(N=290).

Results
983 patients (median age 70, IQR 53-83; in-hospital mortality 29.9%) were recruited over an
11-week study period. Through sequential modelling, a 5-predictor score termed SOARS
(SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) was developed to correlate COVID-19
severity across low, moderate and high strata of mortality risk. The score discriminated well
for in-hospital death, with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.82,
0.80 and 0.74 in the derivation, Aintree and ISARIC validation cohorts respectively. Its
predictive accuracy (calibration) in both external cohorts was consistently higher in patients
with milder disease (SOARS 0-1), the same individuals who could be identified for safe
outpatient monitoring. Prediction of a non-fatal outcome in this group was accompanied by
high score sensitivity (99.2%) and negative predictive value (95.9%).

Conclusion
The SOARS score uses constitutive and readily assessed individual characteristics to predict
the risk of COVID-19 death. Deployment of the score could potentially inform clinical triage
in pre-admission settings where expedient and reliable decision-making is key. The
resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission provides an opportunity to further validate and
update its performance.

INTRODUCTION

Rapid and accurate prediction of the probability of adverse clinical outcomes is central to
the management of global outbreaks of infection. [1-3] Stratification by predicted risk, most
commonly for death, can support clinical judgement and potentially assist clinicians in
community settings to decide how urgently to refer patients to hospital. Used appropriately,
predictive scores can also help inform treatment-related decision making. The pandemic
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lends itself to
predictive modelling by having a large at-risk population and a high adverse event rate
including death.

Although the recent incidence of COVID-19 has decreased in some parts of the world, many
countries are already experiencing a ‘second wave’ of new cases. It is widely anticipated
that viral transmission will continue to surge in the months ahead, particularly with the
onset of winter in the northern hemisphere. Not all patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will
require hospitalisation but even among those who initially experience mild symptoms, a
sizeable proportion remain at risk of subsequent life-threatening clinical decline. The
availability of a practical pre-hospital predictive tool to triage patients for safe discharge to
an outpatient (virtual) monitoring system versus direct admission to hospital for observation
or treatment would be highly advantageous.

Reliable prediction tools to differentiate between levels and sites of clinical care already
exist and have been successfully implemented in pre-hospital practice. For example, both
the CURB-65 and CRB-65 scoring systems for the assessment of community-acquired
pneumonia include recommendations for out-of-hospital care. [4, 5] Recent research by the
ISARIC-4C Consortium has provided an accurate tool to similarly prognosticate for COVID19-attributed death in hospitalised patients but its reliance on laboratory-measured indices
limits its applicability outside the institutional environment. [6] Prognostic evaluation of
individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of diagnostic testing is
potentially achievable but has yet to be examined.

Our objective was to develop and evaluate an easy-to-apply and accurate prediction score
that could identify, early in the illness course, which patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
might benefit from an urgent hospital assessment or could be safely monitored in their own
home. To develop the initial risk score, we used multivariate logistic regression to explore
the relationships between a large panel of candidate predictors and COVID-19 death.
Iterative modelling resulted in a pragmatic predictive score based on five widely available
patient variables. The scoring of patients against these selected predictors permitted three
distinct risk classes to be defined. The performance of the score was then assessed against
two validation cohorts – a large and randomly selected subgroup of the ISARIC study
patients and a smaller single-hospital cohort, the latter to better reflect local population
characteristics and practice.

METHODS

Study design and characteristics of the derivation cohort
All individuals aged 18 or over who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction between 1st March and 16th May 2020 after
presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) at Watford Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS
Hospitals Trust were prospectively recruited. Baseline clinical characteristics and investigation
results were collected according to a pre-specified protocol. Patients were either referred to
the virtual hospital (VH) for outpatient monitoring or admitted to a medical ward. The study
was approved by the National Health Service Health Research Authority (20/HRA/2344; ethics
reference: 283888).

Laboratory, physiologic and radiographic data
All laboratory tests were performed as part of routine clinical care. Nasopharyngeal mucosal
swabs for rRT-PCR were couriered to the regional UK Public Health England laboratory.
Baseline vital observations included all the parameters recommended by the National Early
Warning Score. [7] Chest radiographs acquired in ED were collated and scored at the end of
the recruitment period.

Location and level of care
Following presentation, patients who were clinically judged to have mild illness were referred
to the virtual hospital for subsequent monitoring. To avoid missing early clinical deterioration
in the post-assessment period, they were observed for up to 24 hours in hospital. Patients
who remained admitted after the first 24 hours but who did not require additional respiratory
support beyond wall-based oxygen were managed on designated medical wards. Where
clinically indicated, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was provided on such wards
or on the intensive care unit (ICU); intubation and mechanical ventilation were undertaken
on the ICU.

Identifying predictors of death in the derivation cohort
The primary outcome of the study was hospital discharge or in-hospital death. TRIPOD
recommendations were followed for multivariate model evaluation and reporting. [8] 75
baseline clinical and non-clinical variables were initially collected based on their reported
association with COVID-19 and analysed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression with
bootstrap resampling. [3-5,9] Candidate predictors of death were assessed for potential
clustering effects and missing at random values were addressed by multiple imputation with
chained equations (MICE), [9] with 10 – 20 random draws to account for data variability.

Development and external validation of the clinical risk score
The large external cohort comprised a randomly selected sub-population of the ISARIC 4C
derivation population (N=20,000 provided; 14,231 with complete data for scoring). The
primary data of these individuals were submitted by 260 hospitals across England, Scotland
and Wales to the prospective ISARIC World Health Organization Clinical Characterization
Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study. [6] We also tested our score against a smaller population of SARSCoV-2-positive cases from Aintree Hospital, Liverpool (N=303 provided; N=290 with complete
data for scoring) as a single-setting validation control.

All performance metrics against external cohorts were analysed using the prediction score
and not the regression model. In the initial stages, a preliminary score comprising 12
independent predictors of death, including Care Home residency, was developed; to enable
external validation against the ISARIC cohort (which did not include residential data), Care

Home status was excluded as a variable to yield an 11-predictor score. Its ability to
discriminate for in-hospital mortality was assessed by the area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC). From this score, a condensed version comprising 5 clinical predictors
was developed for pre-hospital application. Mortality cut-points at each risk level were
assessed to define mild, moderate and high risk classes, followed by determination of positive
and negative predictive values as well as sensitivity and specificity thresholds. Model
performance was further assessed by calibration using a graphical representation of the
Hosmer-Lemeshow ‘goodness-of-fit’ test to depict agreement between the expected
(predicted) and observed (actual) outcome across the entire COVID-19 severity range in both
validation cohorts. The summary relationship between the dependent variable (death) and
different levels of disease severity in the external ISARIC population was expressed as
McFadden’s R2.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were expressed as frequency (%), with significance determined by the
Chi-squared test. Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range) or
mean (standard deviation) and analysed by the t-test, Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U test,
as appropriate. Odds ratios (ORs) were assessed as unadjusted and adjusted values with
respect to in-hospital death, the latter determined by multivariate regression with
bootstrapping of 1000 resamples (10 Bootstrap). MICE was used to generate valid estimates
of randomly missing values in the derivation model. A P value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses including risk modelling calculations were
performed using STATA, version 16 (Stata Corp., Texas, USA).

RESULTS

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the derivation cohort
983 patients (52.5% male) confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR-positive were recruited over the
11-week study period. Five patients remained in hospital at the time of data censoring on 31st
May 2020. The median age of the cohort was 70 (IQR: 53 – 83; range 23 – 99); median age

was lowest in the virtual hospital pathway (53; IQR 43 – 67) and highest amongst hospitalised
patients who did not receive CPAP (77; IQR 61 – 86) (P<0.001) (appendix 1).

The commonest co-morbidities were hypertension (48.4%), pulmonary disease (30.0%),
cardiac disease (26.6%), diabetes mellitus (23.6%), chronic kidney disease (CKD; 20.0%) and
dementia (15.4%). Obesity, defined as BMI >30, was present in 24.7% (243) of the cohort, and
associated with an unadjusted OR for death of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.18 – 2.68, P <0.05).

Overall, 294/983 (29.9%) patients died in hospital, the vast majority (97.3%) aged 50 or over.
The mortality rates of different age brackets in the cohort (compared to the ISARIC and
Aintree validation cohorts) are shown in appendix 2. The univariate OR for death increased
with rising age, and was 14.86 (95% CI: 6.89 – 32.04) for those aged 70 – 79 and 20.87 (95%
CI: 9.93 – 43.86) for those aged 80 or older (table 1). When stratified by maximal levels of
care, mortality rate was lowest in the VH (1.8%) and highest in the ICU group (62.1%)
(P<0.001) (appendix 3).

White Caucasian ethnicity constituted 77.3% (760/983) of the whole cohort while Asian, Black
and other minor ethnicities (BAME) represented 16.5%, 4.5% and 1.7% respectively. Overall,
White ethnicity was associated with the highest proportion of non-survivors (85.0%); in
comparison, patients of Asian (OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38 – 0.85, P<0.01) or Black (OR 0.39, 95%
CI: 0.17 – 0.88, P <0.05) background in this cohort were not at a higher risk of death from
COVID-19. The proportion of non-survivors within each ethnic group was also highest in White
(32.9%), followed by Asian (21.6%), Black (15.9%) and other minority groups (17.6%) (P<0.01).
Of note, White patients were significantly older by median age (74, IQR 58-85) compared to

Care home residency (204/983; 20.8%) was more common amongst non-survivors (P <0.001)
and was associated with an unadjusted risk of death of 3.14 (95% CI: 2.28 – 4.32, P<0.001).
Based on frailty data from 644 patients aged 65 or older, the univariate OR of this predictor
for death was 2.52 (95% CI: 1.73 – 3.69; P<0.001) in those with a group 1 frailty score and 2.56
(95% CI: 1.62 – 4.06; P<0.001) in those with a group 2 frailty score (table 1).

The median time from symptom onset to presentation for the derivation cohort was 6 days
(IQR 2.0 – 11.0), with no difference between survivors and non-survivors. The four
commonest reported symptoms were fever (61%), breathlessness (57.9%), cough (52.8%) and
myalgia (21.7%). Tachypnoea (respiratory rate >24/minute) and hypoxia (SpO2 ≤92% on
ambient air) were evident in 35.9% and 31.4% of patients respectively, and associated with
crude OR for death of 2.15 (95% CI: 1.63 – 2.84, P<0.001) and 3.74 (95% CI: 2.73 – 5.12,

Multivariate regression for independent risk factors of mortality
The bootstrapped multivariable regression analysis included the whole derivation cohort of
983 patients comprising 689 (70.1%) survivors and 294 (29.9%) non-survivors with complete
or multiply imputed values for data. Older age, CKD stage 5, baseline hypoxia, elevated BMI,
tachypnea, leucocytosis and a history of stroke were identified as the strongest independent
predictors of mortality (table 1). In particular, age ≥70 had the highest OR for death over the
other individual variables. Following adjustment for co-variate effects, Care Home residency
was excluded as a predictor of mortality; cut-point analysis also showed that individual blood
markers were not independently predictive.

Iterative modelling to construct an 11-predictor and 5-predictor risk prediction scores
We used values from 770 patients with complete data in the derivation cohort to develop an
initial 11-predictor score that ranged from 1 – 18 points (appendix 4). The lowest score of 1
point reflected the KDIGO categorisation of CKD. [11] In this score, the correlation between
increasing COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality followed a linear dose response
relationship, particularly between a score of 3 (below which no deaths occurred) and 12
(above which no patient survived), and an accuracy (AUROC) of 0.84 (figure 1). A shorter 5predictor score based solely on clinical parameters and scaled from 0 – 8 points was also
developed (table 2; figure 1). This short score, abbreviated to SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age,
Respiratory rate, Stroke history), demonstrated an AUROC of 0.82 and was retained for
further evaluation as a practical pre-hospital risk stratification tool.

External validation and performance of the SOARS score
The performance metrics of the long 11-predictor and 5-predictor (SOARS) scores were
assessed by their ability to discriminate for in-hospital mortality against both the ISARIC and
Aintree validation cohorts (table 3). The longer score showed higher discrimination in the
Aintree (AUROC 0.87) than the ISARIC cohort (0.77). The SOARS score had a slightly lower
AUROC against both cohorts, namely 0.80 (Aintree) and 0.74 (ISARIC). In comparison, the
performance of other scores based solely on different cut-offs of age were associated with
inferior discriminatory ability. Comparison of some of the main population parameters
between the derivation and both external cohorts are shown in appendix 5.

The mortality rate at each level of the SOARS score in the derivation and both validation
cohorts are shown in table 4. For increased applicability, the SOARS score results were
further categorised into three risk classes – low (SOARS 0 – 1), moderate (SOARS 2) and high
(SOARS ≥3) (table 5). Between 2.3 – 3.2% of patients scoring 0 or 1 (low risk) in each of the
three cohorts died due to COVID-19 whereas 2.3 – 6.3% of those scoring 2 (moderate risk)
failed to survive to discharge. Overall, 9 out of every 10 deaths in each of the derivation and
validation cohorts had a SOARS score of 3 or greater. Within this broad range of increasing
scores, the highest proportion of deaths was encountered at SOARS score 4 in both the
derivation cohort and ISARIC validation cohort (28.3% and 34.5% respectively) and at SOARS
score 5 in the Aintree validation cohort (30.9%).

Sensitivity thresholds calculated for the larger validation (ISARIC) cohort showed that the low
risk class (SOARS 0 – 1) comprised 16.6% of patients with an in-hospital mortality of 5.4%,
sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for ruling out death of 99.2% and 95.9%
respectively (table 6). By comparison, 29.8% of patients were classified within the moderate
risk class; their mortality rate was 14.5%, sensitivity 97.0% and NPV 94.6%. The high risk class
comprised 70.2% of the validation cohort who scored across a wide range of SOARS scores,
The NPV and specificity for a prediction of death were thus more variable, from 90.5% and
38.7% respectively for a SOARS score of 3, to 69.8% and 99.8% respectively at the other end
of the scale when the SOARS score was 7. Only one patient scored 8; they survived to
discharge.

Reliability of the risk estimates in the ISARIC cohort, modelled as calibration or goodness-offit between expected (predicted) and observed outcomes using SOARS, showed a calibration
slope of 0.70, calibration-in-the-large (CITL) 0.02 and an expected-to-observed (E:O) ratio of
0.990 (figure 2). Calibration was slightly improved in the Aintree cohort with a slope of 0.80,
CiTL -0.16 and E:O ratio of 1.06. A LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing algorithm)
curve was generated to show differences between these outcomes in both cohorts. The plot
characteristics suggested that the model, whilst demonstrating good concordance, had
greater predictive accuracy in low to moderate risk patients whose predicted probability of
mortality was under 40%. Conversely, overestimation of mortality risk was evident in patients
in the high risk group.

DISCUSSION

We show that prognostic evaluation of a small panel of baseline clinical and demographic
characteristics of patients with COVID-19 enables their subsequent risk of in-hospital death
to be quantified across three strata of risk. Findings were obtained by applying the 5-predictor
SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) score to a large random sample
of the ISARIC cohort and a smaller single-hospital cohort from Aintree, both with individuallevel data. Our objective was to enable risk stratification to be undertaken early, ideally prehospitalisation, during the encounter with COVID-19 suspected individuals. This role is not
met by currently available prediction tools that rely on laboratory measurements.

The SOARS score discriminated well for COVID-19 mortality and its simplicity obviated the
need for complex calculations. It also retained good predictive accuracy in two external
validation cohorts, with performance metrics that were primarily reflected in its high negative
predictive values for mortality amongst patients with the lowest risk scores (0 or 1). This
characteristic is consistent with a high accuracy for predicting a non-fatal outcome in its key
target group, namely individuals with milder COVID-19.

Patients who score SOARS 0 or 1 could be discharged home with advice to re-establish urgent
contact if their symptoms worsened. Patients stratified as moderate risk (SOARS 2) could be
virtually monitored with a pre-defined plan for care escalation if specific thresholds relating
to deteriorating symptoms or self-recorded SpO2 were triggered. Patients in the high-risk class
(score ≥3) are highly likely to be symptomatic and would, in all probability, be referred directly
to the ED for hospital-based management. Thus, the target individuals for the SOARS score
are those with a low or moderate risk of COVID-19 mortality.

Our data concur with other reports that advanced age is the strongest predictor of death from
COVID-19. [12-15] The sharp increase in mortality in patients within the derivation cohort
who were in or beyond their seventh decade of life was reflected in the magnitude of their
respective adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital death, namely 7.4 (aged 70 – 79) and 10.7 (aged
≥80). Even so, predictive models generated with age as the lone variable showed poorer
discriminatory ability than the SOARS score.

The early development of physiological abnormalities in COVID-19 does not always result in
timely clinical presentation. In our study, two measures of acute physiological perturbation
proved to be important predictors of COVID-19 mortality: hypoxia and tachypnoea. Although
persistent hypoxia is more common in non-survivors of COVID-19, its relationship with
tachypnoea remains incompletely understood. [16,17] Fewer than half of patients with
COVID-19 who present to hospital with decreased oxygen saturation report experiencing
subjective breathlessness. [18-21] One reason for this observation might be so-called ‘silent
hypoxia’ where a blunted symptomatic perception of the effects of hypoxaemia is apparent
even when low arterial oxygen tension is evident. [22] This phenomenon may be responsible
for delays in seeking clinical attention. Such danger could be mitigated by accurate risk
assessment including the measurement and tracking of SpO2 in patients who are deemed to
not require immediate hospitalisation. The absence of oxygen determination in the CURB-65
score has been cited as limiting its utility in stratifying COVID-19 patients for outpatient
management. [23]

The SOARS score was constructed with data from hospitalised patients as the very low
adverse event rate amongst non-admitted cases (for example, in the VH pathway) curtailed
the development of a prognostic tool. This issue has previously been highlighted in the
context of CRB-65 where low event rates in community studies of pneumonia made predictive
inferences difficult to conclude. [4] Other scores that have been used in COVID-19 studies
have either not been designed for this disease or have relied heavily on laboratory-measured
data. [24-27]

Our multivariate regression model was bootstrapped to reduce overfitting but not penalized
prior to external validation. In common with other severity scores for COVID-19, we
dichotomized several continuous data parameters which may have potentially obscured nonlinear effects between predictors and outcome, contributing to the difference in AUROC
values between our derivation and validation cohorts and between both validation cohorts.
[6, 24, 26] We also used in-hospital mortality as an unambiguous disease-related primary
outcome rather than 30 or 60-day mortality. The better performance of the SOARS score in
the smaller Aintree validation cohort compared to the much larger ISARIC cohort may have

been due to its more homogeneous case-mix. This comparison suggested that, on balance,
the simplicity of a pre-hospital risk prediction tool, provided it retained acceptable accuracy,
may outweigh any minor diminution of its performance arising from improved practicality.

Other limitations in the study include the occurrence of missing information despite
prospective data collection. The use of multiple imputation to estimate missing values for
multivariate regression and the availability of nearly 85% of observations for constructing the
risk stratification rule helped to mitigate against underestimating their role. The modest
sample size of our derivation cohort was dictated by the incident caseload during the
pandemic. However, selective sampling of the pandemic timeline was avoided by including
all COVID-19 cases from the initial rise to the subsequent decline in new case numbers over
the 11-week study period. Finally, reduced score calibration at the high-risk end suggests that
SOARS may overestimate the probability of death in the highest risk cases. However, the
principal objective of this score was to enhance frontline decision-making in patients with a
low predicted risk of mortality at a time when demand for in-patient resources are likely to
be high.

In summary, prognostication using the SOARS score can be undertaken concomitantly with
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing to inform clinical triaging, including decisions about the
placement of the patient for ongoing care. Analysis of the ISARIC validation cohort in this
study showed that between 16.6% and 29.8% (those scoring up to SOARS 1 or 2 respectively)
could potentially have avoided admission provided a safe alternative to hospitalization was in
place. Prospective studies of SOARS implementation will enable the score to be calibrated
against other independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients to examine its performance under
conditions that may be unique to different localities. Such an opportunity may soon present
itself if SARS-CoV-2 transmission continues to increase in the UK and beyond.

Appendix.

Pre-specified study protocol for clinical data collection

PREDICT COVID Clinical Data Collection protocol
Date: 1st March 2020

Aims
1. To prospectively collect data on all adults (> 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
(COVID-19) presenting to Watford Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, during the first wave of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, including an outcome of in-hospital death or hospital discharge,
2. To develop a prognostic (risk prediction) score using the above derivation data,
3. To construct a practical clinical scoring system for predicting mortality (and risk of morbidity) after
validation of score against external, i.e. independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients from other UK sites,
4. To include and assess outcomes of patients referred to the COVID-19 Virtual Hospital (out-of-hospital
monitoring) in the same NHS Trust,
5. To monitor and characterise surviving patients for up to 12 months from the time of confirmation of SARSCoV-2 infection, including the domains of psychological, physiological and radiological impairment and
recovery.
Primary outcome
In-hospital mortality with minimum 30-day follow-up data.
Secondary outcomes
Longer term mortality and morbidity: radiological, psychological and cardiorespiratory. This will also be
assessed against ongoing health care needs.
Patient inclusion
All adult patients (aged >18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(rRT-PCR) confirmation.
Completed admission and outcomes at 3 months and 12 months.
Inclusion criteria:
• Readily available patient or clinical characteristic to attending clinicians upon presentation to hospital
(Accident & Emergency department, Acute Medical Receiving Unit)
• Blood markers should be commonly measured and results available for review within the first 24
hours of admission
• All parameters relating to oxygen supplementation and advanced respiratory support including one or
more of: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel non-invasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow
nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygenation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) needs

Exclusion criteria
All SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR negative patients irrespective of clinical suspicion of COVID-19.
All individuals aged <18y.

Selection of candidate variables for initial data collection
Candidate variables were chosen based on knowledge of their potential association/s with SARS-CoV-2
infection and clinical disease (COVID-19). A systematic literature search was undertaken to identify these
variables with respect to their predictive association for mortality and other adverse outcomes including
COVID-19 severity and disease-related complications such as requirement for critical care and the
development of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Statistical analysis for derivation and validation modelling
In analysing the data collected from the derivation (West Herts) cohort, categorical variables will expressed as
frequency (%), with significance determined by the Chi-squared test. Continuous variables will be analysed for
median (interquartile range) or mean (standard deviation) outcomes and analysed by the t-test, Kruskal-Wallis
or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Missing data in the derivation cohort will be expected even with
prospective data collection; missingness of data will be assumed to be at random and handled by multiple
imputation by chained equations (MICE) with at least ten imputations, provided the proportion of missingness
for the defined parameter constitutes no more than 20% of the cohort. Collated data will be subjected to
univariate and multivariate logistic regression in order to determine odds ratios (OR) for in-hospital mortality.
The latter will also be internally validated by bootstrapping using a minimum of 1000 re-samples. Predictor
interactions will be analysed by appropriate methodology such as the likelihood ratio (LR) test comparing
broad and narrow (constrained) models.
All performance metrics against external validation cohorts will be analysed using the prediction score and not
with the multivariate regression model. The performance of the derivation model will be assessed for
discriminatory ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic, AUROC) and calibration (graphical
representation of Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis).
All statistical analyses including risk modelling calculations will be performed using STATA, version 16 (Stata
Corp., Texas, USA).
