ABSTRACT (150 words)

52

The quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in wastewater has emerged as a

53

useful tool to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks in the community. This approach was

54

implemented in the metropolitan area of A Coruña (NW Spain), where wastewater from

55

a treatment plant was analyzed to track the epidemic dynamics in a population of

56

369,098 inhabitants. Statistical regression models from the viral load detected in the

57

wastewater and the epidemiological data from A Coruña health system that allowed us

58

to estimate the number of infected people, including symptomatic and asymptomatic

59

individuals, with reliability close to 90%, were developed. These models can help to

60

understand the real magnitude of the epidemic in a population at any given time and can

61

be used as an effective early warning tool for predicting outbreaks. The methodology of

62

the present work could be used to develop a similar wastewater-based epidemiological

63

model to track the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic anywhere in the world.

1. INTRODUCTION

73

According to previous reports, a great proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2

74

are asymptomatic (Bi et al. 2020, Day 2020, Randazzo et al. 2020a, Yang et al. 2020), a

75

condition that depends on many factors such as the mean age in the population and that

76

promotes the undetected spread of COVID-19. A systematic literature review found that

77

at least an important proportion of COVID-19 patients, including symptomatic and

78

asymptomatic people, tested for fecal viral RNA were positive from initial steps of

79

infection (Gupta et al, 2020). This excreta of viral RNA in patients stool occurs for an

80

extended period, importantly even more than a month after the patient has tested

81

negative for their respiratory samples (Chen et al. 2020, Wölfel et al. 2020, Wu et al.

82

2020a, Xing et al. 2020, Xu et al. 2020, Zhang et al. 2020). Therefore, genetic material

83

of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in wastewater (Lodder and de Roda Husman 2020),

84

which has made monitoring of viral RNA load in sewage an excellent tool for the

85

epidemiological tracking of the actual pandemic as well as an extremely efficient early

86

warning tool for outbreaks detection (Randazzo et al. 2020a, Ahmed et al. 2020,

87

Medema et al. 2020, Peccia et al. 2020, Wu et al. 2020b, Wurtzer et al. 2020).

88

Wastewater is a dynamic system and its analysis can provide a faithful reflection of the

89

circulation of microorganisms in the population. Previous studies have evaluated the

90

presence in wastewater of other viruses, such as enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A

91

virus, adenovirus, poliovirus or sapovirus (Ehlers et al. 2005, Hellmér et al. 2014, Hovi

92

et al. 2012, Lizasoain et al. 2018, Mancini et al. 2019). During the present global

93

COVID-19 pandemic, processes to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater were first

94

developed in the Netherlands (Medema et al. 2020), followed by the USA (Nemudryi et

95

al. 2020), France (Wurtzer et al. 2020), Australia (Ahmed et al. 2020), Italy (La Rosa et

96

al. 2020) and Spain (Randazzo et al. 2020a, Randazzo et al. 2020b). In the first study to

97

look at SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, seven cities and Schiphol airport in the

98

Netherlands were monitored during the early stages of the pandemic. Genetic material

99

started to appear at more sites over time, as the number of cases of COVID-19 increased

100

(Medema et al. 2020). In the USA, a wastewater plant in Massachusetts detected a viral

101

RNA load higher than expected based on the number of confirmed cases, reflecting

102

viral shedding of asymptomatic cases in the community (Wu et al. 2020b). Three

103

wastewater plants in Paris measured the concentration of the virus over a 7-week period

104

that included the beginning of the lockdown on March 17th. They found that viral RNA

105

load was correlated with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. They also noted

106

that viral RNA could be detected in the wastewater before the exponential growth of the

107

disease and that the amount of viral RNA decreased as the number of COVID-19 cases

108

went down, roughly following an eight-day delay (Wurtzer et al. 2020). Another study

109

of six wastewater plants in Spain, covering a region with the lowest prevalence of

110

COVID-19, also detected the virus in wastewater before the first COVID-19 cases were

111

reported (Randazzo et al. 2020a). A recent study from Yale University took a different

112

approach by measuring the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage sludge in

113

New Haven (Connecticut, USA), as opposed to wastewater. They tracked viral RNA

114

concentrations against hospital daily admissions and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the

115

community. They found that viral RNA concentrations were highest 3 days before peak

116

hospital admissions, and 7 days before peak community COVID-19 cases, which

117

showed that virus RNA concentration is an earlier indicator of progression of COVID-

118

19 in the community than traditional epidemiological indicators (Peccia et al. 2020).

119

Also, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sludge at concentrations potentially suitable for

120

monitoring was confirmed (Balboa et al. 2020). These studies showed the potential of

121

monitoring SARS-CoV-2 levels in wastewater and sewage sludge to track and even pre-

122

empt outbreaks in the community.

123

During the last decade, Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a

124

highly relevant discipline with the potential to provide objective information by

125

combining the use of cutting-edge analytical methodologies with the development of ad

126

hoc modelling approaches. WBE has been extensively used to predict with high

127

accuracy the consumption patterns of numerous substances, such as the use of illicit

128

drugs in different populations or countries (EMCDDA 2020). Therefore, the

129

development of epidemiology models based on wastewater analysis has been intensive

130

in the last years. Several examples from the literature showed different approaches and

131

strategies to tackle the uncertainty associated with WBE studies. For example, Goulding

132

and Hickman assumed three main sources of uncertainty (fluctuations in flow,

133

uncertainty in analytical determinations, and the actual size of the population served by

134

the wastewater treatment plant) and, using Bayesian statistics, fitted the data to linear

135

regression hierarchical models (Goulding and Hickman 2020). Other modelling

136

approaches (Croft et al. 2020) considered Monte Carlo simulations to deal with

137

uncertainties and with the propagation of errors associated with the parameters that are

138

usually considered in WBE. Again, wastewater inflow variability was highlighted as a

139

prominent source of uncertainty, as well as the stability of the substances in wastewater

140

and their pharmacokinetics. In general, WBE studies showed that despite the wide

141

number of parameters involved in predicting the consumption rate of a specific

142

substance, a correct selection of assumptions combined with a thoughtful modelling

143

process will overcome such uncertainty, leading to accurate results. Recently, a study

144

has confirmed the theoretical feasibility of combining WBE approaches with SARS-

145

CoV-2/COVID-19 data (Hart and Halden 2020).

146

The main objective of the present work was to develop a useful statistical model to

147

determine the entire SARS-CoV-2 infected population, including symptomatic and

148

asymptomatic people, as well as to predict outbreaks, by tracking the viral load present

149

in the wastewater of a treatment plant located in the Northwest of Spain that serves a

150

metropolitan area with near 370,000 residents.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS

152
153

2.1. Sample Collection

154

The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Bens (43° 22' 8.4'' N 8° 27' 10.7'' W, A

155

Coruña, Spain) serves the metropolitan area of A Coruña, which includes the

156

municipalities of A Coruña, Oleiros, Culleredo, Cambre and Arteixo, which correspond

157

to a geographical area of 277.8 km2 and to a population of 369,098 inhabitants (Figure

158

1). The wastewater samples were collected by automatic samplers installed both at the

159

entrance of the WWTP Bens and in a sewer collecting sewage from COVID-19 patients

160

housed on 7 floors of the University Hospital of A Coruña (CHUAC). At the WWTP

161

Bens, 24-h composite samples were collected from April 15th until June 4th, while at

162

CHUAC 24-h composite samples were collected from April 22nd to May 14th (Dataset

163

S1). In addition, samples were collected at 2-h intervals for 24 h on specific days at the

164

WWTP Bens and at CHUAC (Dataset S1). The 24-h composite samples were collected

165

by automatic samplers taking wastewater every 15 min in 24 bottles (1 h per bottle) and,

166

when the 24-h collection ended, the 24 bottles were integrated and a representative

167

sample of 100 mL was collected. For the collection of 2 h intervals, 2 bottles obtained

168

every 2 h were integrated, finally providing 12 bottles per day.

169
170

2.2. Sample processing

171

Samples of 100 mL were processed immediately after collection at 4 ºC. Firstly, 100 mL

172

samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 x g and then filtered through 0.22 µm membranes.

173

Samples were then concentrated and dialyzed using Amicon Ultra Filters 30 KDa (Merck

174

Millipore) in 500 µL of a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCL, 100 mM NaCl y 8 mM MgSO4.

175

Samples were preserved in RNAlater reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) at -80 °C.

177

2.3. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assays

178

RNA was extracted from the concentrates using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit

179

(Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer´s instructions. Briefly, the sample was

180

lysed under highly denaturing conditions to inactivate RNases and to ensure isolation of

181

intact viral RNA. Then, the sample was loaded in the QIAamp Mini spin column where

182

RNA was retained in the QIAamp membrane. Samples were washed twice using

183

washing buffers. Finally, RNA was eluted in an RNase-free buffer. The quality and

184

quantity of the RNA was checked using a Nanodrop Instrument and an Agilent

185

Bioanalyzer. Samples were kept at -80ºC until use.

186
187

RT-qPCR assays were done in a CFX 96 System (BioRad, USA) using the qCOVID-19

188

kit (GENOMICA, Spain) through N gene (coding for nucleocapsid protein N)

189

amplification. Reaction mix (15 µL) consisted of: 5 µL 4x RT-PCR Mix containing

190

DNA polymerase, dNTPs, PCR buffer and a VIC internal control; 1 µL of Reaction Mix

191

1 containing primers and FAM probe for N gene; and 0.2 µL of reverse transcriptase

192

enzyme. The internal control allowed discarding the presence of inhibitors. The cycling

193

parameters were 50 °C for 20 minutes for the retrotranscription step, followed a PCR

194

program consisting of a preheating cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, 50 cycles of amplification

195

at 95 °C for 5 s and finally one cycle of 60 °C for 30 s. RT-qPCR assays were done in

196

sextuplicate.

197
198

For RNA quantification, a reference pattern was standardized using the Human 2019-

199

nCoV RNA standard from European Virus Archive Glogal (EVAg) (Figure S1). To

200

build the calibration curve, the decimal logarithm of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/µL

201

ranging from 5 to 500 were plotted against Ct (threshold cycle) values. Calibration was

202

done amplifying the N gene.

203

2.4. Data collection

204

The model was fully customized to the scenario of the metropolitan area of A Coruña

205

integrating data gathered from different sources:

206

Daily observations at the meteorological station of A Coruña-Bens for the period March

207

1st – May 31st, 2020, including rainfall, temperature, and humidity (source: Galician

208

Meteorology Agency, MeteoGalicia (Dataset S2)).

209

Cumulative and active number of COVID-19 cases in the metropolitan area of A Coruña and

210

from the health area A Coruña – Cee for the period March 1st – May 31st (source:Galician

211

Health Service (SERGAS), the General Directorate of Public Health (Automous Government of

212

Galicia) and the University Hospital of A Coruña (CHUAC) (Dataset S3).) Since flow may be

213

an important variable when determining the viral load in the wastewater, an exploratory

214

data analysis for the volume of water pumped at the WWTP Bens during the lockdown

215

period has been performed using flow data (Dataset S4). This flow study is described in

216

the Supplementary Material section.

217
218

2.5. Backcasting of COVID-19 active cases

219

Preliminary statistical methods have been devised to backcast the number of COVID-19

220

active cases based on reported official cases.

221

Follow-up times (available only until May 7th) for anonymized individual reported

222

COVID-19 cases in Galicia (NW Spain where the WWTP Bens is located, Figure 1)

223

have been used to count the number of cases by municipality based on patient zip codes.

224

Since the epidemiological discharge time is missing, the number of active cases in the

225

metropolitan area of A Coruña could not be obtained but the cumulative number of

9

226

cases was computed. On the other hand, the main epidemiological series for COVID-19

227

were publicly available in Galicia at the level of health areas. However, the definition of

228

one of the series changed from cumulative cases to active cases in April 29th.

229

Thus, the epidemiological series for COVID-19 in the health area of A Coruña – Cee

230

(population 551,937) was used to estimate the epidemiological series for COVID-19 for

231

the metropolitan area of A Coruña (population 369,098). To do this, a linear regression

232

model was used to relate the relative cumulative and active cases (cases per million) of

233

COVID-19 for the health area of A Coruña – Cee. Predicting the rate of active cases and

234

considering the population size in the metropolitan area gives the estimated total

235

number of official active cases in the five municipalities.

236

The previous approach is only possible until May 7th, our database update date. To

237

estimate the number of official active cases from May 8th onwards, another linear

238

regression model has been used to relate the number of active cases in the health area of

239

A Coruña – Cee and in the metropolitan area of A Coruña. Since the number of active

240

cases in the health area has been reported until June 5th, the series of estimated official

241

active cases could be backcasted from May 8th until June 5th.

242

Finally, to transform the official number of COVID-19 cases into the real number, the

243

ratio mean of real cases / mean of official cases was estimated using the official figures

244

of cumulative cases. The results of the seroprevalence study carried out by the National

245

Center of Epidemiology in Spain were used to estimate the number of actual active

246

cases in Galicia: 56,713 for April 27th – May 11th (prevalence 2.1%) and 59,414 for

247

May 18th – June 1st (prevalence 2.2%) (Pollán et al. 2020). Confronting these numbers

248

with the official numbers in May 11th (10,669) and June 1st (11,308) gives estimated

249

ratios of 5.316 and 5.254 in these two periods, with an average of around 5.29. This

250

conversion factor was used to backcast the series of real active cases based on the

10

251

estimated daily official COVID-19 cases in the metropolitan area of A Coruña. Some of

252

these series, including the backcasted series of real active cases, are included in the

253

Dataset S3.

254

2.6. Nonparametric setting of viral load overtime

255

Generalized Additive Models (GAM) using a basis of cubic regression splines (Hastie

256

et al. 1990) and LOESS (Cleveland 1979) nonparametric regression models have been

257

used to fit the viral load along the day on May 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th, and as a function of

258

time at CHUAC from April 22nd to May 12th and at WWTP Bens from April 16th to

259

June 3rd. Several outliers have been removed from the data, corresponding to

260

unexpected and intensive pipeline cleaning episodes (8-hour 70 ºC water cleaning

261

during Thursday-Friday nights) carried out in April 23rd-24th, April 30th - May 1st and

262

May 7th-8th.

263
264

2.7. Viral load models

265

In order to find a useful statistical model to predict the number of real infected cases,

266

including symptomatic and asymptomatic people, well-known regression models, such

267

as simple and multivariate linear models, and more flexible models, such as

268

nonparametric (e.g. local linear polynomial regression) and semiparametric (GAM and

269

LOESS) models, have been formulated. The flexible ones allowed the introduction of

270

linear and smooth effects of the predictors on the response.

271

All these models have been successfully used to predict the number of COVID-19

272

active cases based on the measured viral load (number of RNA copies/L) at WWTP

273

Bens, daily flow in the sewage network as well as other environmental variables, such

274

as rainfall, temperature and humidity.

275

Diagnostic tests (Q-Q plots, residuals versus fitted values plots and Cook’s distance)

276

were used for outlier detection, which improved the models fit. The R statistical

277

software was used to perform statistical analyses (R Core Team, available at

https://www.R-project.org/). Namely, the mgcv library (Wood 2006) was applied to fit

279

GAM models and ggplot2 and GGally (Schloerke et al. 2020, Wickham 2016) to

280

perform correlation analysis, obtain graphical output and fit LOESS models,

281

respectively. The caret R package was used to fit and evaluate regression models.

282
283

Although some RT-qPCR replicates could not be measured when the viral load was

284

scarce, due to the limitation of the detection technique (errors randomly occur when the

285

number of copies/L is under 10,000), 74% of the assays led to three or more measured

286

replications, which gives a good statistical approach. However, conditional mean

287

imputation (Enders 2010) was used for unmeasured replications. Thus, unmeasured

288

replications in an assay were replaced by the sample mean of observed measurements in

289

that assay. In the only assay with all (six) unmeasured replications, the number of RNA

290

copies was imputed using the minimum of measured viral load along the whole set of

291

assays.

3.1. Estimated COVID-19 positive cases in the metropolitan area of A Coruña

296

To model the viral load, the number of COVID-19 positive cases needed to be reported

297

or estimated (Figure 2). However, due to difficulties in determining the exact number of

298

positive cases, mathematical models had to be developed based on data recovered in

299

Dataset S3. Thus, linear regression models (Figure 3) were successfully used to estimate

COVID-19 positive cases in the A Coruña – Cee health area, where the region of this

301

study is located (Figure 1). This was based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients before

302

April 29th (Figure 3A) and, from this date on, on positive cases reported by health

303

authorities in Galicia. A linear regression trend was fitted to predict the proportion of

304

positive cases in the health area of A Coruña – Cee based on the proportion of

305

cumulative cases (Figure 3B). This linear regression fit was finally used to estimate the

306

positive cases in the metropolitan area of A Coruña served by the WWTP Bens, by

307

means of the proportion of cumulative positive cases in the same area, which was

308

directly obtained from the individual patient data.

3.2. Daily variation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the metropolitan area of A

311

Coruña and hospital

312

The evolution of the viral load along the day both at the A Coruña metropolitan area

313

and at the University Hospital Complex of A Coruña (CHUAC) was monitored in order

314

to discern which amount of the viral load detected in the WWTP Bens came from the

315

CHUAC and which from the community. An analysis of the viral load of the 24-h and

316

2-h samples collected at the WWTP Bens and CHUAC, as reflected in Dataset S1, was

317

performed. The RT-qPCR results for 24-h samples are included in Dataset S5 and

318

results for 2-h samples are included in Dataset S6. Because of the small sample size,

319

nonparametric LOESS models were used in order to prevent the possible overfitting of

320

alternatives such as GAM. Figure 4 shows the viral load trends at CHUAC (Figure 4A)

321

and at WWTP Bens (Figure 4B) depending on the hour of the day, during four different

322

days. Figure 4A shows the hourly trend at CHUAC, with a maximum around 08:00,

323

whereas the viral load curves at WWTP Bens (Figure 4B) attained a minimum around

324

05:00 and a maximum between 14:00 and 15:00.

3.3. Lockdown de-escalation in the metropolitan area of A Coruña

326

As expected, the mean viral load decreased with time when measured at CHUAC

327

(Figure 5A, late April – mid May) and at WWTP Bens (Figure 5B, mid April – early

328

June) following an asymptotic type trend (fitted using GAM with cubic regression

329

splines).

330

Time course quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in A Coruña WWTP Bens

331

wastewater correlated with the estimated number of COVID-19 positive cases, as

332

shown in Figure 6. The number of copies of viral RNA per liter decreased from around

333

500,000 to less than 1,000, while the estimated cases of patients infected by SARS-

334

CoV-2 decreased approximately 6-fold in the same period, reaching in both cases the

335

lowest levels in the metropolitan area at the beginning of June.

336
337

3.4. Wastewater epidemiological models based on viral load for COVID-19 real

338

active cases prediction

339

Firstly, a correlation analysis (Figure 7) was done finding that estimated number of

340

COVID-19 positive cases strongly correlated linearly with the logarithm of daily mean

341

viral load at Bens (R=0.923) and with the mean flow (R=-0.362). Nonetheless, a strong

342

inverse linear relationship between estimated COVID-19 positive cases and time was

343

found (R=-0.99).

344
345

Then, different regression models were tested to predict the real number of COVID-19

346

active cases based on the viral load and the most relevant atmospheric variables. The

347

best results were obtained using GAM models depending on the viral load and the mean

348

flow (Figure 8). The effect of the viral load on the COVID-19 estimated active cases

349

showed a logarithmic shape (Figure 8A), which suggested that the number of COVID-

14

350

19 real active cases could be modeled linearly as a function of the logarithm of the viral

351

load. On the other hand, the shape of the effect of the mean flow on the estimated

352

number of COVID-19 real active cases appears to be quadratic (Figure 8B), but its

353

confidence band was wide and contained the horizontal line with height zero, which

354

means that the effect of the mean flow was not significant (p value=0.142). Therefore,

355

the only independent variable that was significant was the viral load, with R2=0.86.

356
357

Since the nonparametric estimation of the viral load effect had a logarithmic shape, a

358

multiple linear model was fitted using the logarithmic transformation of the viral load,

359

daily flow, rainfall, temperature, and humidity. Figure 9 shows the more explicative

360

models for different number of predictors using the R2 maximization criterion, finding

361

that the only significant predictor was the viral load. In fact, when a multivariate linear

362

model depending on three predictors (viral load, daily flow, and rainfall) was fitted, data

363

showed that the only significant explanatory variable was the viral load (p

364

value=1.32·10-8). Table 1 shows that the effect of the other two predictors, daily flow (p

365

value=0.186525) and rainfall (p value=0.099239), were not clearly significant.

366
367

Finally, ignoring the rest of the explanatory variables, only the natural logarithm of the

368

viral load gave a good linear model fit (R2=0.851) that was useful to predict the real

369

number of active COVID-19 cases (Figure 10A). After removing three outliers, the fit

370

improved slightly (R2=0.894), as shown in Figure 10B.

371
372

The final fitted linear model became:

373
374

Y = - 7079 + 1059 · log X

375

where Y denotes the real number of active COVID-19 cases, X is the viral load (number

376

of RNA copies per L) and log stands for the natural logarithm.

377
378

For instance, a viral load of Y = 150,000 copies per liter would lead to an estimated

379

number of X = 5,543 active cases.

380
381

The prediction ability of this fitted linear model, the GAM, and the linear and quadratic

382

LOESS models has been evaluated using a 6-fold cross validation procedure, to prevent

383

overfitting. In all cases, the response variable was the estimated number of real COVID-

384

19 active cases in the metropolitan area (Figure 2), and the explanatory variable, the

385

natural logarithm of the viral load. Table 2 shows the corresponding prediction R2 for

386

each one of the four models, along with the root mean squared prediction error

387

(RMSPE). The smaller this error, the better the predictive ability of the model was. All

388

the models provided quite accurate predictions for the real number of COVID-19 active

389

cases using the viral load, with an error of around 10% of the response range. The

390

model with the lowest prediction error, 9.5%, was the quadratic LOESS model. Flexible

391

models, such as LOESS and GAM, slightly improved the predictive performance when

392

compared with the linear model, which has a prediction error of around 11.4% of the

393

response range. The quadratic LOESS model was also the one with the largest value for

394

R2. Therefore, it provided the best predictive results.

395

Figure 11A shows a scatter plot of the estimated number of COVID-19 active cases in

396

the metropolitan area versus the natural logarithm of the viral load, along with the

397

quadratic LOESS fitted curve. Figure 11B displays the actual and predicted values of

398

real number of COVID-19 active cases. The diagonal line was added to compare with

399

the perfect model prediction.

4. DISCUSSION

401
402

On March 9th 2020, the city of A Coruña, in the region of Galicia, reported the

403

circulation of SARS-CoV-2 for the first time, with data of a COVID-19 outbreak in a

404

civic center that affected 11 people, as well as data on a few more dispersed cases. At

405

that point, a surveillance phase on approximately 250 people began, and the

406

recommendations from the Health Department on cleaning and mobility restrictions

407

were followed (GCiencia 2020a). During these initial days of the COVID-19 epidemic

408

in Galicia, most of the cases were in the municipality of A Coruña. Thus, at noon on

409

March 13th, the Xunta de Galicia (Government of the Autonomous Community of

410

Galicia) reported 90 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Galicia, 43 of them in the A

411

Coruña area (GCiencia 2020b). The Spanish Government declared a state of alarm on

412

March 14th throughout the country, at which point the Galician community still had few

413

cases. Despite this, in a few days the region went from a monitored and controlled

414

situation to an exponential growth of cases (Rey 2020), reaching a peak of 1667 active

415

cases. The cases were distributed in an area that covers the municipalities of A Coruña

416

and Cee, as shown by the data provided by SERGAS (Galician Health Service) in

417

https://www.datawrapper.de/_/QrkrZ. This area does not coincide with the area that

418

discharges its wastewater into the WWTP Bens, which serves the municipalities of A

419

Coruña, Oleiros, Cambre, Culleredo, and Arteixo, but the figures give an idea of the

420

magnitude of the epidemic at that stage. In this context, an exploratory sampling and

421

analysis was carried out on April 15th, which showed the presence of viral genetic

422

material in the wastewater of the WWTP Bens. From April 19th, the 24-hour composite

423

samples were continuously analyzed until early June for this study, although

424

surveillance has continued and will continue at WWTP Bens until the virus disappears.

425
426

The data from wastewater obtained from April 19th onwards has confirmed the decrease

427

in COVID-19 incidence. We showed that time course quantitative detection of SARS-

428

CoV-2 in wastewater from WWTP Bens correlated with COVID-19 confirmed cases,

429

which backs up the plausibility of our approach. Moreover, the seroprevalence studies

430

carried out by the Spanish Centre for Epidemiology showed that cases in A Coruña

431

represented about 1.8 % of the local population. This means that, for a population of

432

about 369,098 inhabitants, the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2

433

contributing their sewage into the WWTP Bens would be around 6,644, which includes

434

people with symptoms and those who are asymptomatic. Considering that the ratio

435

between people with symptoms (reported by the health service) and the total infected

436

population (including asymptomatic people) is estimated to be 1:4, we calculated that

437

reported cases contributing their wastewater into WWTP Bens would be around 1,661,

438

which is close to the maximum number of cases reported in the A Coruña-Cee area

439

(1,667 cases on April 28th). It must be noted that the criteria used by the authorities to

440

report cases varied over time, so this may explain the gap between the graphs reported

441

in the media throughout the epidemic and our Figure 6, where both a decrease in the

442

viral load and in the estimated COVID-19 cases can be observed from mid April to

443

early June.

444

However, the level of the curve at WWTP Bens at the beginning of May was much

445

higher than that corresponding to May 11th. This is due to the effectiveness of the

446

lockdown measures applied in Spain. The May 12th daily curve at CHUAC showed a

447

higher viral load than the one corresponding to May 11th at WWTP Bens, showing the

448

viral load measured at the hospital tends to be higher than at WWTP Bens due to a

449

lower dilution effect, as expected.

450

In the present work, nonparametric and even simple parametric regression models have

451

been shown to be useful tools to construct prediction models for the real number of

452

COVID-19 active cases as a function of the viral load. This is a pioneering approach in

453

the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic since, to our knowledge, WBE studies

454

available are still limited to reporting the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WWTPs

455

and sewer networks, in order to establish a direct comparison with declared COVID-19

456

cases (Randazzo et al. 2020a, Medema et al. 2020, Nemudryi et al. 2020, La Rosa et al.

457

2020, Randazzo et al. 2020b, Polo et al. 2020). The only precedent combines

458

computational analysis and modeling with a theoretical approach in order to identify

459

useful variables and confirm the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of WBE as a

460

prediction tool (Hart and Halden 2020). Other examples of WBE models have been

461

applied to previous outbreaks of other infectious diseases. For example, during a polio

462

outbreak detected in Israel in 2013-2014, a disease transmission model was optimized

463

incorporating environmental data (Brouwer et al. 2018). Given the availability of

464

clinical information on poliovirus, the developed infectious disease model incorporated

465

fully validated parameters such as the transmission and vaccination rates, leading to

466

accurate estimations of incidence. This type of study highlights one of the main

467

challenges we have faced developing our model: the SARS-CoV-2 novelty and the

468

associated scarcity of epidemiologic information. Considering this, our statistical model

469

has minimized the uncertainty implementing a complete set of hydraulic information

470

from the sewer network of the city of A Coruña, available thanks of a joint effort from

471

different local authorities. This ad hoc model can be adapted to other scenarios as long

472

as similar hydraulic information can be obtained from the area where it will be used.

474

Other possible explanatory variables (such as rainfall or the mean flow) did not enter

475

the model. Although this is a bit counterintuitive (dilution should affect the viral load

476

measured), it is important to point out that rainfall fluctuated little during the data

477

collection period mid April – early June: its median was 0, its mean was 2.88 L/m2 and

478

its standard deviation was 6.59 L/m2.

479
480

Therefore, as a consequence of the results of the GAM fit, a simple linear model was

481

considered to fit the estimated number of COVID-19 active cases as a function of the

482

logarithm of the viral load. The percentage of variability explained by the model was

483

reasonably high (85.1%) increasing up to 89.4% when three outliers detected were

484

excluded. Alternative, more flexible models, such as GAM and LOESS, were also

485

fitted. They produced slightly better results in terms of R2 and RMSPE. The quadratic

486

LOESS model avoided overfitting and showed a good predictive ability (R2=0.88,

487

RMSPE=478), the best among all the considered models. However, similar results were

488

found for the linear model that also brings the advantage of simplicity. Therefore, both

489

models, linear and LOESS quadratic, could be successfully used to predict the number

490

of infected people in a given region based on viral load data obtained from wastewater.

491
492

Our models, as described, are only applicable to the metropolitan area of A Coruña, the

493

region for which they have been developed, although can be adapted to any other

494

location. This area has Atlantic weather and it may rain substantially in autumn and

495

winter, which could lead to explanatory variables such as rainfall and/or mean flow

496

becoming significant for those seasons and needing to enter the prediction model. Thus,

497

when applying these models to the same location but in seasons with different climatic

498

behavior, they might need to be reformulated. In addition, the methodology used to

499

build these statistical models could be used at other locations for epidemiological

500

COVID-19 outbreak detection, or even for other epidemic outbreaks caused by other

501

microorganisms. Of course, in that case a detailed data analysis would have to be

502

carried out as well, since specific features of the sewage network or the climate may

503

affect the model itself.

504
505

5. CONCLUSIONS

506

To the best of our knowledge, these are the first highly reliable wastewater-based

507

epidemiological statistical models useful for tracking COVID-19 epidemic that could be

508

adapted for use anywhere in the world. These models allow the actual number of

509

infected patients to be determined with around 90% reliability, since it takes into

510

account the entire population, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. These statistical

511

models can estimate the real magnitude of the epidemic at a specific location and their

512

cost-effectiveness and speed of sampling can help to early alert health authorities about

513

potential new outbreaks, thereby helping to protect the local population.
