Abstract

Background: Remdesivir (RDV) is the only antiviral drug registered currently for treatment of
COVID-19 after a few clinical trials with controversial results. The purpose of this study was
to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19 in real world
settings.
Methods: Patients were selected from 1496 individuals included in the SARSTer national
database; 122 of them received therapy with RDV and 211 were treated with
lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based therapy. The primary end-point of effectiveness was clinical
improvement in the ordinal 8-point scale, which was defined as a 2-point decrease from
baseline to 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of hospitalization. The secondary end-points of
effectiveness included: death rate, rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of
hospitalization in the ordinal scale, rate of the need for constant oxygen therapy, duration of
oxygen therapy, rate of the need for mechanical ventilation, total hospitalization time, and
rate of positive RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 after 30 days.
Findings: Significantly higher rates of clinical improvement, by 15% and 10% respectively,
were observed after RDV treatment compared to LPV/r at days 21 and 28. The difference
between regimens increased with worsening of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and depending on
the baseline score from the ordinal scale. Statistically significant differences supporting RDV
were also noted regarding the rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of
hospitalization and hospitalization duration in patients with baseline SpO 2 ≤90%. In the
logistic regression model only the administration of remdesivir was independently
associated with at least a 2-point improvement in the ordinal scale between baseline and
day 21.
Interpretation: In conclusion, data collected in this retrospective, observational, real world
study supported use of remdesivir for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection particularly in
patients with oxygen saturation ≤95%.

Introduction
In December of 2019, a new pathogen associated with an outbreak of respiratory tract
infections was discovered in Wuhan, China. It was identified as a novel coronavirus termed
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) closely related to already
known betacoronaviruses responsible for epidemics named with the acronyms SARS and
MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). The outbreak of the disease it causes, named
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was announced a global pandemic by the World
Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection
ranges from asymptomatic or mild self-limited respiratory tract disease to severe
progressive pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death
due to multi-organ failure. At the start of the epidemic, only supportive care was available,
but the rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 has raised a desperate need to invent an
antiviral agent active against SARS-CoV-2. At the beginning, the search for effective therapy
focused on drug repurposing and new uses for approved agents with confirmed activity
against other viruses. Among them, a compound of lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r) was
identified. Lopinavir acting as an inhibitor of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
protease, co-administered with ritonavir to increase its bioavailability, was demonstrated to
have in vitro activity against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The positive
impact of LPV/r on clinical outcome and reduction of the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs
were documented in the patients participating in the open-label study performed at the
outbreak of SARS in 2003. Three case reports and one retrospective study described the use
of LPV/r in patients with MERS, suggesting improved clinical outcome [6, 7]. Hence, due to
the structural similarity of all betacoronaviruses, the relevance of LPV/r in the treatment of
COVID-19 was considered. To answer the question of whether this antiviral agent works in
SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cao et al. [8] performed an urgent open-label randomized clinical trial
in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to evaluate the LPV/r efficacy in patients diagnosed
with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the study results were disappointing and no superiority of
LPV/r therapy in terms of clinical improvement, duration of hospitalization, or period of viral
RNA detectability as compared to standard of care (SoC), was documented. The only
difference of statistical significance was observed in the median time to clinical
improvement calculated after exclusion of patients with early death; however, the authors
themselves called this difference “modest” [8]. No positive impact of LPV/r therapy was
documented in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia treated in the
intensive care unit and also in patients with mild to moderate form of COVID-19 compared
to SoC or adjuvant therapy [9, 10, 11].
Since the process of discovery, testing and registration of a new antiviral drug is long-lasting
and cost-intensive with an uncertain chance of success, attention has been paid to
investigational drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. The most promising among
them is remdesivir (RDV), a prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analogue which terminates
viral RNA synthesis by inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), with
established dosing and safety profile. The primary clinical indication of RDV was Ebola virus
disease (EVD). However, despite the encouraging results of the in vivo efficacy evaluation in
an animal model, the randomized phase III clinical trial did not clearly confirm the relevance

of RDV in humans and then this investigational agent was shelved [12]. There was a renewed
interest in RDV concerning SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and confirmed in vitro and
animal models activity against the family of coronaviruses has raised hope for effective
application in the treatment of COVID-19 [13]. Since the inhibitory effect on the recently
emerged novel coronavirus was demonstrated in vitro, clinical trials and compassionate use
programs have started, and the WHO announced the launch of a trial that would include one
group of patients treated with remdesivir [14, 15, 16]. Finally, based on findings from phase
III clinical trials ACTT-1 and SIMPLE-severe, on 1st May 2020 RDV received emergency use
authorization (EUA) for the treatment of COVID-19 issued by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) [17, 18, 19]. Subsequent conditional licences in different countries
worldwide have made remdesivir the first approved antiviral agent for the treatment of
COVID-19.
The purpose of the study is evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of RDV administered
to patients with COVID-19 in real-world settings. Lopinavir/ritonavir based regimen was used
as a comparator instead of undefined and inperfect concept of „standard of care”, applied
usually in COVID-19 studies.
Material and Methods
The study population consisted of patients selected from 1496 individuals included in the
SARSTer national database. This ongoing project, supported by the Polish Association of
Epidemiologists and Infectiologists, is a national real-world experience study assessing
treatment in patients with COVID-19. Patients whose data were collected in the SARSTer
database were treated in 30 Polish centres, between 1 March and 31 August 2020. The
decision about the treatment regimen was taken entirely by the treating physician with
respect to current knowledge and recommendations of the Polish Association of
Epidemiologists and Infectiologists [20, 21]. The current analysis included 333 adult patients
who received regimens based on the antiviral drugs remdesivir or lopinavir/ritonavir
administered for therapy of COVID-19. RDV was administered intravenously once a day with
a loading dose of 200 mg and later a maintenance dose of 100 mg for 5–10 days. LPV/r was
administered orally in a dose of 400/100 mg every 12 hours for up to 28 days. LPV/r was
used mostly at the beginning of the pandemic and due to documented later lack of
effectiveness is considered as a comparator for RDV in this study.
Data were entered retrospectively and submitted online by a web-based platform operated
by "Tiba" sp. z o.o. Parameters collected at baseline included age, gender, body mass index
(BMI), comorbidities and concomitant medications, clinical status at admission, additional
medication dedicated to COVID-19, and adverse events. Baseline clinical status at admission
to hospital was classified as asymptomatic, symptomatic stable with oxygen saturation
(SpO2) >95%, symptomatic unstable with SpO2 91-95%, symptomatic unstable, SpO2 ≤90% or
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
The primary end-point of treatment effectiveness was clinical improvement in the ordinal
scale based on WHO recommendations modified to fit the specificity of the national health
care system. Improvement was defined as a 2-point decrease from baseline to 7, 14, 21 and

28 days of hospitalization. The ordinal scale was scored as follows: 1. unhospitalized, no
activity restrictions; 2. unhospitalized, no activity restrictions and/or requiring oxygen
supplementation at home; 3. hospitalized, does not require oxygen supplementation and
does not require medical care; 4. hospitalized, requiring no oxygen supplementation, but
requiring medical care; 5. hospitalized, requiring normal oxygen supplementation; 6.
hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation with high-flow oxygen equipment; 7. hospitalized,
for invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 8. death.
The secondary end-points of effectiveness included: death rate, rate of no clinical
improvement within 28 days of hospitalization in the ordinal scale, rate of the need for
constant oxygen therapy, duration of oxygen therapy, rate of the need for mechanical
ventilation, total hospitalization time, and rate of positive RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 after 30
days of hospitalization.
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or n (%). P values of <0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant. The significance of difference was calculated by chisquare or Fisher's exact test for nominal variables and by Mann-Whitney U and
Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA for continuous variables. Univariate comparisons were calculated by
GraphPad Prism 5.1 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Forward stepwise logistic
regression models with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as a model selection
criterion were performed with ≥2-point decrease in the ordinal scale between baseline and
day 21 of hospitalization as the dependant variable. Among independent variables tested
were age, sex, BMI, diabetes, coronary artery disease, baseline classification and baseline
score in ordinal scale, as well as therapy with RDV, LPV/r, tocilizumab, dexamethasone,
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, heparin, dexamethasone, convalescent plasma and
azithromycin. Logistic regression models were calculated by use of R and MATLAB
(MathWorks, MA, USA).
Results
Among 333 patients included in the study 122 received therapy with RDV and 211 were
treated with LPV/r. Groups were balanced regarding gender, age and BMI, but in both arms,
there was a predominance of males (Table 1). Patients treated with RDV more frequently
demonstrated a symptomatic unstable course of the disease with SpO2 ≤95% at admission to
the hospital (69%) compared to those receiving LPV/r (57%), but the difference was not
statistically significant. Prevalence of accompanying diseases was higher among patients
treated with RDV, but the difference was significant only regarding ischaemic heart disease
(Table 1). During the therapy with RDV additional medication more frequently included
dexamethasone, convalescents plasma, and low molecular weight heparin, whereas LPV/r
was more frequently administered together with chloroquine and azithromycin (Table 1).
As shown in Figure 1, proportions of categories of ordinal scale were balanced at the
baseline between the two treatment groups. The rate of patients discharged from the
hospital was similar on days 7 and 14, but became higher in patients treated with RDV on
days 21 and 28 (Figure 1). Differences in the score in the ordinal scale between particular

time points and baseline at admission to the hospital are shown in Figure 2. Clinical
improvement measured using an ordinal scale demonstrated significantly higher rates after
RDV treatment compared to LPV/r at weeks 21 and 28 and the difference was 15% and 10%
respectively (Table 2). Additional analysis of clinical improvement using the ordinal scale was
carried out depending on the baseline oxygen saturation at admission to hospital. Difference
between regimens increases with worsening of oxygen saturation during the analysis on
days 14, 21 and 28 (Table 2). A similar tendency was demonstrated depending on the
baseline score from the ordinal scale. On the other hand, the rate of no improvement within
28 days was significantly higher after treatment with LPV/r (Table 2). This tendency was also
demonstrated in analysis carried out with regard to baseline oxygen saturation or baseline
ordinal score, and differences between two regimens increased with either decline of
oxygen saturation or decrease of baseline ordinal score (Table 2). As shown in Table 2 the
rate of no clinical improvement within 28 days of hospitalization and hospitalization duration
was significantly lower in patients treated with RDV if they had baseline SpO2 ≤90%..
In the logistic regression model in patients receiving RDV or LPV/r only the administration of
remdesivir was independently associated with at least a 2-point improvement in the ordinal
scale between baseline and day 21, while older age and use of tocilizumab were negative
predictors of response (Table 3). Interestingly, in patients with older age tocilizumab on the
contrary improved likelihood of response.
Patients treated with LPV/r experienced significantly more adverse events (39%) than those
treated with RDV (20%). The most frequent among those receiving LPV/r were diarrhoea
(25%), nausea (8.5%), vomiting (6.2%) and prolongation of the QT interval (5.2%). Patients
treated with RDV most frequently experienced elevation of aminotransferases (9.8%), and
other adverse events occurred sporadically (Table 2).
Discussion
Since 1st May 2020, the FDA's emergency use authorization has allowed for remdesivir to be
distributed and administered intravenously to treat COVID-19 in patients with severe disease.
It has become possible due to the promising results of phase III clinical trials. Hence, the
antiviral agent which failed to live up to expectation in the treatment of Ebola virus disease
has become a hope for those infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conditional approvals issued in other
countries and regions worldwide in the wake of the decision of the United States federal
agency has enabled the treatment of RDV in patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing
oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support. However, giving access to a new
potential therapy, the need for further research to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
the RDV was highlighted.
Since June 2020 remdesivir has also been available in Poland. Therefore we aimed to assess
the efficacy and tolerability of RDV in real-world experience. LPV/r based regimen was used
as a comparator due to its antiviral mode of action because both agents act by inhibiting viral
proteins. We used this idea instead of undefined and inperfect concept of „standard of care”,
applied usually in COVID-19 studies, which can be recognized in the different way depending
on treating center and period of pandemic. As the lack of benefit of LPV/r treatment compared
to SoC was documented by Cao et al. [8] in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia, in the
current analysis we assumed the efficacy of LPV/r at the level close to placebo. The majority

of patients receiving RDV presented symptomatic unstable status with SpO 2 ≤ 95% at
admission to the hospital (68%). Using the ordinal scale widely applied in COVID-19 trials, we
confirmed that RDV treatment was associated with significantly greater clinical improvement,
defined as a two-point decrease in disease severity, by day 21 (86% vs. 71%, p=0.001) and 28
(93% vs. 83%, p=0.01) compared to the LPV/r arm. A significant difference at day 21 was
observed regardless of the baseline score at admission to the hospital. The detailed analysis
carried out considering the baseline oxygen saturation demonstrated a statistically significant
difference among unstable patients, by day 21 for individuals with SpO2 ≤ 90%, and by day 28
for those with baseline SpO2 91-95%. The possible reason for the lack of difference by day 7
and 14 could be an effect of national regulation used until 31 August 2020, which in practice
ordered hospitalization of the majority of patients for at least 14 days irrespective of
treatment and clinical improvement.
Hence, our findings supported results from clinical trials, including those based on which the
decision of EUA was made [17, 18, 19]. Patients with COVID-19 without reduced oxygen levels
included in the SIMPLE-moderate phase III trial treated with RDV for 5 days were significantly
more likely to have clinical improvement as compared to those receiving SoC alone, whereas
for those randomized to the 10-day regimen a significant difference was not documented [22].
Similar results were obtained for patients with the severe form of COVID-19 defined as oxygen
saturation <95% while breathing ambient air or receiving oxygen support, treated with RDV in
SIMPLE-severe phase III trial. Clinical improvement was demonstrated in 65% and 54% of
patients receiving RDV for 5 and 10 days, respectively [18]. In both trials the assessment was
performed at a time point different from ours , at day 11 for moderate and 14 for severe
disease [18, 19, 22]. Notably, the comparison concerning patients with severe COVID-19 was
not randomized and performed not within one study but between individuals on RDV
treatment included in the SIMPLE-severe phase III clinical trial and concurrent retrospective
real-world cohort study on SoC only [19]. Moreover, not all patients treated with RDV were
included in the comparative analysis. After exclusion of Italian patients on RDV due to lack of
comparative individuals on SoC from the real world experience (RWE) study, 74% of those
treated with RDV fulfilled criteria for clinical improvement as compared to 59% among the
SoC cohort at day 14 (p<0.001).
This imperfection was not shared by another phase III study ACTT-1 designed as a doubleblind, randomized and placebo-controlled trial. The preliminary results of this study confirmed
RDV superiority relative to placebo (normal saline solution) in shortening the time to recovery,
11 vs. 15 days. Patients were assessed daily using an ordinal scale and the primary outcome
measure was the first day on which the patient reached one of the three lowest levels in the
scale meaning "not hospitalized with or without limitation of activities" and "hospitalized not
requiring supplemental oxygen and ongoing medical care". However, the trial is not
completed and final data are still expected [17]. Also, data from the compassionate-use
programme confirmed the benefit of RDV treatment in patients with severe COVID-19,
including those on invasive ventilation, reporting a 68% rate of clinical recovery [23]. Unlike
the above-mentioned studies, no positive impact of RDV relative to placebo was documented
in patients with the severe form of COVID-19 with baseline oxygen saturation < 95% included
in the randomized, double-blind multicentre phase III clinical trial conducted in Wuhan [14].
However, it should be noted that enrolment was prematurely terminated due to control of
the epidemic in Wuhan, and hence the study was underpowered.

The current analysis demonstrated benefit from RDV treatment as compared to LPV/r in terms
of secondary end-points. Among them, a statistically significant difference was found for rate
of no improvement within 28 days in the ordinal scale, whereas for the remaining parameters,
including death rate, the need for constant oxygen therapy and its duration, the need for
mechanical ventilation, rate of positive RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 after 30 days, and
hospitalization length, the positive impact of RDV without statistical significance was
documented. Interestingly, most striking and significant effect of RDV on the length of
hospitalization was observed in patients with baseline SpO2 who needed on average 7 days
less of hospital stay. Our findings on mortality are in line with results achieved in the clinical
trials SIMPLE and ACTT-1 and an observational study conducted among patients with cancer
[17, 19, 22, 23].
Unfortunately, detailed comparison regarding remaining outcomes is not possible due to
different end-points and time of assessment [17, 19, 22].
The tolerability profile of remdesivir in the current analysis was in accordance with clinical
trials with the most frequent transient aminotransferases elevation reported in nearly 10% of
patients. LPV/r was frequently responsible for transient diarrhoea, well known from
experience in HIV infected patients, which did not affect significantly clinical status of patients
and duration of hospitalization.
We are aware of the limitations of our study. Among them, the impact of other therapeutic
agents dedicated to COVID-19 should be pointed out. Baseline characteristics demonstrated
the different distribution of patients with respect to concomitant drugs with a significantly
higher rate of dexamethasone, convalescent plasma and low molecular weight heparin, and a
lower rate of chloroquine and azithromycin among patients treated with RDV. To eliminate
this imbalance as a confounding factor we performed analysis using logistic regression,
demonstrating that in patients receiving RDV or LPV/r only the administration of remdesivir
was independently associated with at least a 2-point improvement in the ordinal scale at day
21. Importantly, in this model we could not prove an additional independent beneficial effect
of dexamethasone or convalescent plasma on this endpoint, while the use of tocilizumab was
only beneficial in older patients.
Other limitations of the current analysis are related to the RWE nature of the research,
including its observational nature and retrospective electronic data capture with possible data
entry errors. Unfortunately, we were not able to increase the number of patients in the study
because of changed national regulations, which allowed the release of a patient from the
hospital without RT PCR negativisation, which could significantly affect ordinal scale
interpretation. However, the major strength of the study is collection of data from a realworld, heterogeneous population, thus being representative for routine practice, and a clearly
defined comparator, unlike in some other studies, which usually used an undefined SoC.
Interestingly, we observed that addition of tocilizumab can improve the likelihood of
improvement, which supports our previous experience with this drug, but possible use of
combined therapy of remdesivir and tocilizumab needs further study [24].
In conclusion, data collected in this retrospective, observational, real-world study with
antivirals as a leading therapy in two competing arms supported the use of remdesivir
compared to lopinavir/ritonavir for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in
patients with oxygen saturation ≤95%.
