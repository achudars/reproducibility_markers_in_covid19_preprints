Abstract
Introduction: Cardiac complications of COVID-19 are potentially life-threatening. The
occurrence of myocardial injury in the context of COVID-19 is multifactorial and has generated
increasing interest.
Methods: A systematic review with meta-analysis of the literature was performed. MEDLINE
and EMBASE were searched. Two independente reviewers evaluated the selected manuscripts
for the outcome “myocardial injury”, defined by troponin elevation above the 99th percentile.
Study heterogeneity and risk of bias were evaluated.
Results: Eight studies, with a total of 1229 patients, were included. The frequency of myocardial
injury was 16% (95% CI: 9% - 27%). The heterogeneity among studies was high (93%).
Conclusions: Myocardial injury may occur in patients with COVID-19, with a frequency of 16%
among current studies. Continuous research is needed to update these findings, as the pandemic
evolves, and to define the implications of myocardial injury in the context of this infection.

Introduction
The association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and adverse outcomes in patients
with COVID-19 has been consistently described. In the series of Ruan et al, among 68 patients
who died, 19% had CVD, versus none among those who survived (p<0,001) [1]. However, there
is also evidence of acute cardiac damage in the context of the infection. Recently, the first proven
case of direct cardiac damage was published, with demonstration of viral particles inside
cardiomyocytes of a patient with COVID-19 with cardiogenic shock who underwent
endomyocardial biopsy [2].
Troponin elevations, suggesting myocardial damage, are frequent in severe infections [3].
Abnormal troponin values have been frequently found in patients with COVID-19, especially
when high-sensitivity troponin is employed. Among the first 41 COVID-19 patients in China, 5
(12%) had acute myocardial injury (manifested by troponin elevations > 99th percentile), and 4
of these needed intensive care treatment [4], demonstrating the increased severity associated with
this presentation. The aim of this study was to therefore evaluate the frequency of acute
myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19.

Methods
A systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the frequency of acute
myocardial injury expressed by abnormal troponin levels (>99th percentile) in hospitalized
patients with COVID-19.

Outcomes
Abnormal troponin levels (>99th percentile), with or without clinical manifestation of
acute cardiac injury.
Study types

Sources of information
Two databases were searched: MEDLINE and Embase. Other manuscripts were manually

Search strategies
Search strategies are described in the Supplementary Material. The search was performed
until 04/02/2020. No language restrictions were applied.

A meta-analysis of random effects was performed by the DerSimonian and Laird method,
and results were shown in forest plots. The measure of effect was the logit of the proportion of
myocardial injury. Heterogeneity was estimated by I2. In the presence of substantial (>50%)
heterogeneity, a meta-regression was performed using clinical and demographic variables as
determinants. The presence of bias was analyzed using a funnel plot and also quantitatively by
Egger´s test.

Results
The PRISMA flowchart is shown in the Supplementary Material. After exclusions, eight
manuscripts were considered eligible for the meta-analysis. The overall quality of the
manuscripts was graded as low to moderate.
Acute myocardial injury
Table 1 depicts the studies which described the occurrence of cardiac injury in
hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The frequencies of myocardial injury ranged from 3.3% to
44.4% [1,4-10]. Figure 2 shows the results of the meta-analysis. In hospitalized patients with
COVID-19, the frequency of myocardial injury was 16% (95%CI: 9%-27%). There was high
heterogeneity among the studies (93%), so a meta-regression was performed (Table 2). Age and
the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were found as a sources of
heterogeneity, and then another meta-analysis was performed with stratification for these
variables (Figure 3). The studies with outlier values (Ruan et al [1] and He et al [5]) were
analyzed separately, resulting in different frequencies of myocardial injury, with 33% in the

worst scenario; however, heterogeneity was still high (92% before stratification and 63% after,
respectively).
Regarding publication bias (Figure 4), even though some asymmetry was observed on the
funnel plot, there was no significant bias (p = 0.3418).

Discussion
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic – an unprecedented situation in modern Medicine
– it is of key importance to learn about the characteristics of the disease and its complications.
Cardiac injury in COVID-19 is a main complication which should be accounted for in patients
who clinically deteriorate, and anticipated in those with risk factors such as prior cardiovascular
disease. Adequate comprehension of its frequency, predisposing factors and characteristics is
therefore desirable.
The definition of acute cardiac injury is controversial, as most studies consider the
elevation of troponin above the 99th percentile as the criterion for myocardial damage, without
necessarily any association with clinical, electrocardiographic or imaging data. Additionally,
different sensitivities of tests and cutpoints for abnormalities may hamper the interpretation of
the studies. Of note, the timing of the troponin measurements was different among the studies,
and patient severity was also variable. These may explain the different frequencies of myocardial
injury between the studies; nonetheless, the overall frequency of 16% depicts an important issue,
which should be underscored.
The mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 may include atherosclerotic plaque
rupture and tipe I acute myocardial infarction, supply/demand imbalance in the context of severe

infection and sepsis, with type II myocardial infarction, or direct myocardial damage, as
demonstrated by Tavazzi et al [2], due to the pathophysiologic substrate (ACE-II receptor) in
cardiomyocytes [11]. All these may be precipitated or aggravated by systemic inflammation and
the “cytokine storm” [1]. Abnormal troponin values, especially if high-sensitivity troponin is
employed, have been frequently reported in patients with COVID-19 since the beggining of the
pandemic. Among the first 41 Chinese patients with COVID-19, 5 (12%) had acute myocardial
injury, and 4/5 needed intensive care support. [4]. Clinical data are key to distinguish the
different disease entities, as shown in case reports; for example, Hu et al [12] described the case
of a 37-year old male, admitted with chest pain and shortness of breath, who was diagnosed with
COVID-19 and displayed ST-segment elevation in inferior leads, troponin T > 10.000 ng/L,
BNP of 21.025 ng/L, but had no coronary stenoses on the CT angiogram. The echocardiogram
revealed severe left ventricular dysfunction, and the final diagnosis was of fulminant myocarditis
with cardiogenic shock. Therefore, it should be emphasized that abnormal troponin results may
be multifactorial and should be interpreted carefully and in conjunction with other data, due to
thir low specificity for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, as Chapman et
al [13] suggest, troponin may also be viewed as an ally, if emphasis is placed on its prognostic
value (and not on the diagnosis of acute coronary artery disease), and also regarding the
epidemiologic issue of recognizing the overall incidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19
patients. Even so, it must be underscored that abnormal troponin levels should not be considered
an indication for procedures such as cardiac catheterization, nor for therapeutic measures such as
the initiation of antiplatelet agentes.

Finally, the current speed of release of data and new publications makes it especially hard
to review the literature, which is fastly evolving. However, a meta-analysis may be useful to

provide an estimate of the frequency of events, which in the present case constitute a particularly
dangerous complication, which should be kept in mind.
Conclusions
In the context of a severe infection, the implications of abnormal troponin measurements
are various, and elevated troponin in COVID-19 may not imply the occurrence of acute
myocardial infarction or myocarditis. Nonetheless, the present review shows that myocardial
injury may occur in 16% of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a frequency which is high
enough to draw attention to this complication.
