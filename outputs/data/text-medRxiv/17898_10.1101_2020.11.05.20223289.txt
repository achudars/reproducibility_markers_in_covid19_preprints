Abstract

28

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are at high risk of severe COVID-19. We

29

measured 436 circulating proteins in serial blood samples from hospitalised and non-

30

hospitalised ESKD patients with COVID-19 (n=256 samples from 55 patients). Comparison

31

to 51 non-infected patients revealed 221 differentially expressed proteins, with consistent

32

results in a separate subcohort of 46 COVID-19 patients. 203 proteins were associated with

33

clinical severity, including IL6, markers of monocyte recruitment (e.g. CCL2, CCL7),

34

neutrophil activation (e.g. proteinase-3) and epithelial injury (e.g. KRT19). Machine learning

35

identified predictors of severity including IL18BP, CTSD, GDF15, and KRT19. Survival

36

analysis with joint models revealed 69 predictors of death. Longitudinal modelling with linear

37

mixed models uncovered 32 proteins displaying different temporal profiles in severe versus

38

non-severe disease, including integrins and adhesion molecules. These data implicate

39

epithelial damage, innate immune activation, and leucocyte-endothelial interactions in the

40

pathology of severe COVID-19 and provide a resource for identifying drug targets.

Introduction

43

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, displays wide clinical

44

heterogeneity from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Patients with severe disease exhibit

45

marked inflammatory responses and immunopathology. The mechanisms underlying this

46

remain incompletely characterised and the key molecular mediators are yet to be

47

determined. The first treatment shown to reduce mortality from COVID-19 in randomised

48

trials was dexamethasone [1], a corticosteroid which has broad non-specific effects on the

49

immune system. Even with corticosteroid treatment, mortality in severe COVID-19 remains

50

significant. There is a wide armamentarium of existing drugs that target inflammation more

51

selectively, providing potential repurposing opportunities for the treatment of COVID-19.

52

Recently, the REMAP-CAP trial has demonstrated efficacy of anti-IL6 receptor blockade in

53

patients admitted to intensive care units with severe disease [2]. In order to select the most

54

promising agents for future trials, we urgently need to better understand the molecular

55

drivers of severe disease. Proteins are the effector molecules of biology and the targets of

56

most drugs. Therefore, proteomic profiling to identify the key mediators of severe disease

57

provides a valuable tool for identifying and prioritising potential drug targets [3].

58
59

Risk factors for severe or fatal COVID-19 include age, male sex, non-European ancestry,

60

obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression [4]. End-stage

61

kidney disease (ESKD) is one of the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 (estimated

62

hazard ratio for death 3.69) [4], and ESKD patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have a

63

mortality of approximately 30% [5–8]. ESKD patients have a high prevalence of vascular and

64

cardiometabolic disease (e.g. hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes), either as a

65

result of the underlying cause of their renal disease or as a consequence of renal failure. In

66

addition, ESKD results in both relative immunosuppression and chronic low-grade

67

inflammation, which may impact viral defence and the host inflammatory response.

68
69

Here we performed proteomic profiling of serial blood samples of ESKD patients with

70

COVID-19, leveraging the unique opportunity for longitudinal sampling in both the outpatient

71

and inpatient settings afforded by a large multi-ethnic haemodialysis cohort (Figure 1a).

72

These data revealed 221 proteins that are dysregulated in COVID-19 versus matched non-

73

infected ESKD patients. Using linear mixed models, joint models and machine learning, we

74

identified proteins that are markers of COVID-19 severity and risk of death. Finally, we

75

characterised the temporal dynamics of the blood proteomic response during COVID-19

76

infection in ESKD patients, uncovering 32 proteins that display altered trajectories in patients

77

with severe versus non-severe disease.

79

Results

80

We recruited 55 ESKD patients with COVID-19 (subcohort A; Table 1). All patients were

81

receiving haemodialysis prior to acquiring COVID-19. Blood samples were taken as soon as

82

feasible following COVID-19 diagnosis. At time of initial sample, 30 patients were outpatients

83

attending haemodialysis sessions and 25 were hospitalised inpatients (Methods, Figure 1).

84

Following the initial blood sample, serial sampling was performed for 51/55 patients. We also

85

recruited 51 non-infected haemodialysis patients as ESKD controls, mirroring the age, sex

86

and ethnicity distribution of the COVID-19 cases (Figure 1 figure supplement 1a-c). We

87

used the Olink proteomics platform to measure 436 proteins (Supplementary File 1a) in

88

256 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients and the 51 control samples. The proteins

89

measured consisted of 5 multiplex ‘panels’ focussed on proteins relevant to immuno-

90

inflammation, cardiovascular and cardiometabolic disease. The 436 proteins assayed

91

showed strong enrichment for immune-related proteins (Supplementary File 1b).

92
93

In addition, we performed the Olink proteomic assays in 52 serum samples from a separate

94

set of 46 COVID-19 positive ESKD patients (subcohort B), and 11 serum samples from

95

ESKD COVID-19 negative controls (a subset of the controls described above). For the large

96

majority of patients only a single timepoint was available. A higher proportion of these

97

patients (41/46, 89%) were hospitalised and had severe disease (Table 2) than in subcohort

98

A (Figure 1, Table 1).

101

Principal components analysis (PCA) of proteomic data from subcohort A demonstrated

102

differences between samples from COVID-19 positive cases and controls, although the two

103

groups did not separate into discrete clusters (Figure 2a-b). To examine the effects of

104

COVID-19 on the plasma proteome, we performed a differential expression analysis in

105

subcohort A between COVID-19 cases (n=256 samples passing quality control from 55

106

patients) and non-infected ESKD controls (n=51) using linear mixed models, which account

107

for serial samples from the same individual (Methods). This revealed 221 proteins

108

associated with COVID-19 (5% false discovery rate, FDR); the vast majority were

109

upregulated, with only 40 downregulated (Figure 3a, Supplementary File 1c). In order to

110

provide a succinct and standardised nomenclature, we report proteins by the symbols of the

111

genes encoding them (see Supplementary File 1a for a mapping of symbols to full protein

112

names). The most strongly upregulated proteins (in terms of fold change) were DDX58,

113

CCL7, IL6, CXCL11, KRT19 and CXCL10, and the most strongly downregulated were

114

SERPINA5, CCL16, FABP2, PON3, ITGA11 and MMP12 (Figure 3 figure supplement 1).

115

Notably, many of the upregulated proteins were chemotaxins.

116
117

We observed that a high proportion of the measured proteins were associated with COVID-

118

19. Given the highly targeted nature of the Olink panels that we used (enriched for immune

119

and inflammation-related proteins), this was not surprising. Nevertheless, to ensure that the

120

Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment of p-values was controlling the false discovery rate at the

121

5% level, we performed two additional analyses (Methods). First, we estimated the FDR

122

using an alternative method (the plug-in method of Tibshirani [9]); this confirmed appropriate

123

FDR control. Second, we used permutation to estimate the distribution of the number of

124

proteins expected to be declared significant under the null hypothesis of no association

125

between any proteins and COVID-19. This showed that the probability of observing the

126

number of differentially abundant proteins we identified was highly unlikely under the null

127

(empirical p < 1x10-5; Figure 3 figure supplement 2).

128
129

Although our COVID-19 negative controls were well matched in terms of age, sex and

130

ethnicity (Figure 1 figure supplement 1a-c), perfect matching of comorbidities was not

131

feasible in the context of the healthcare emergency at the time of patient recruitment. There

132

was a higher prevalence of diabetes in the COVID-19 cases compared to the controls (61.8

133

% versus 47.1%, respectively; Table 1). To evaluate whether differing rates of diabetes had

134

impacted the proteins identified as differentially abundant between cases and controls, we

135

performed a sensitivity analysis adding diabetes as an additional covariate in the linear

136

mixed model. This did not materially affect our findings; estimated effect sizes and -log10 p-

137

values from models with and without the inclusion of diabetes were highly correlated

138

(Pearson r > 0.99, and r = 0.95, respectively; Figure 3 figure supplement 3a-b). Full results

139

from both models are shown in Supplementary File 1c. Similarly, there were also

140

differences in the underlying cause of ESKD in cases compared controls (Table 1). We

141

therefore performed a further sensitivity analysis adjusting for underlying cause of renal

142

failure. This did not make any meaningful difference to our results (Figure 3 figure

143

supplement 3c-d, Supplementary File 1c).

144
145

We also considered the possibility that timing of haemodialysis might affect the plasma

146

proteome. To minimise the impact of this, all samples were taken prior to haemodialysis. For

147

the large majority (86.6%) of samples, the most recent haemodialysis was between 48 and

148

72 hours prior to blood draw. This consistency in timing of blood sampling reduces the

149

potential for impact of this issue. Nevertheless, to evaluate whether timing of haemodialysis

150

might have impacted our results, we performed a sensitivity analysis including time from last

151

haemodialysis as a covariate. Our results were not materially affected by this, with -log10 p-

152

values and estimated effect sizes very highly correlated with those obtained without inclusion

153

of this covariate (Pearson r >0.99 for effect size estimates and for -log10 p-values; Figure 3

154

figure supplement 4a-b, Supplementary File 1c).

155
156

We used the smaller subcohort B (n=52 serum samples from 46 patients with COVID-19;

157

Methods) for validation. We first projected the data from subcohort B into the PCA space of

158

subcohort A to examine how well the separation of cases and controls in the PCA space

159

replicated (Methods). This revealed clearer separation of infected and non-infected patients

160

than in subcohort A (Figure 2c-d), perhaps reflecting the higher proportion of hospitalised

161

patients (41 of 46 patients) in subcohort B (Table 2). We next performed differential

162

abundance analysis in subcohort B and found 201 proteins that were dysregulated in cases

163

versus controls (5% FDR) (Supplementary File 1c). Of the 221 differentially abundant

164

proteins from subcohort A, 150 (69.7%) were also identified in subcohort B at 5% FDR

165

(Figure 4a). Effect sizes in each dataset showed a strong correlation (r=0.80, Figure 4b).

166

This demonstrates that our findings are highly reproducible despite differences in sample

167

sizes and blood materials (plasma versus serum in subcohort A and B, respectively).

168
169

Proteins associated with COVID-19 severity

170

Examination of the principal components plot labelling samples by clinical severity at the

171

time of sampling (defined by WHO severity scores, graded as mild, moderate, severe or

172

critical) demonstrated a gradient of COVID-19 severity, best captured by principal

173

components 1 and 3 (Figure 2 figure supplement 1a). To determine the proteomic effects

174

of COVID-19 severity, we tested for associations between proteins and WHO severity score

175

at the time of blood sampling, using linear mixed models with severity encoded as an ordinal

176

predictor (Methods). This analysis revealed 203 proteins associated with severity (Figure

177

3b, Supplementary File 1d). The majority of these were upregulated in more severe

178

disease, with only 42 down-regulated. A sensitivity analysis adjusting for time since last

179

haemodialysis, made no significant impact on our results (Figure 3 figure supplement 4c-

180

d, Supplementary File 1d). Consistent with previous reports, we found that severe COVID-

181

19 was characterised by elevated IL6. In addition, we observed a signature of upregulated

182

monocyte chemokines (e.g. CCL2, CCL7, CXCL10), neutrophil activation and degranulation

183

(e.g. PRTN3, MPO) and epithelial injury (e.g. KRT19, AREG, PSIP1, GRN). (Figure 3b,c,

184

Figure 5). SERPINA5 and leptin showed the greatest downregulation as COVID-19 severity

185

increased (Figure 3b,c).

186
187

We next asked how does the COVID-19 severity protein signature relate to the proteins that

188

are differentially abundant between cases and controls? The majority (140/203; 69%) of

189

severity-associated proteins were also identified as differentially abundant in the COVID-19

190

positive versus negative analysis (Figure 6a). Log fold changes for proteins in COVID-19

191

versus non-infected patients were correlated with effect sizes in the severity analysis, such

192

that the proteins most upregulated in cases versus controls also tended to show the greatest

193

upregulation in severe disease (Figure 6b). However, there were some notable exceptions

194

(eg CCL20, IL17C, OSM) that were strongly associated with severity but not differentially

195

expressed in infected versus non-infected patients (Figure 6c).

196
197

Supervised learning to predict COVID-19 severity

198

Principal components analysis revealed that some samples from patients who had mild or

199

moderate disease at the time of sampling clustered with samples from patients with severe

200

disease (Figure 2 figure supplement 1a). Examination of the same PCA plot this time

201

labelling samples according to the patient’s overall clinical course (measured by peak WHO

202

severity score over the duration of the illness) (Figure 2 figure supplement 1b), revealed

203

that these samples came from individuals who subsequently developed severe or critical

204

disease. This suggested that molecular changes may predate clinical deterioration. To

205

evaluate this further, we used supervised learning approaches to test if the proteomic

206

signature of the first blood sample for each patient in our dataset could identify whether the

207

patient either had clinically severe COVID-19 at the time of sampling or would develop

208

severe disease in the future. Whereas differential expression analyses consider each protein

209

marker separately, machine learning techniques allow examination of all proteins

210

concurrently, thus capturing non-linear relationships in the dataset. Using Random Forests,

211

we trained a classifier on the first sample for each COVID-19 patient to predict the overall

212

clinical course, defined by peak WHO severity. For the purposes of this analysis, we

213

binarised clinical course into either WHO mild/moderate or severe/critical.

214
215

The Random Forests method achieved 71% accuracy in predicting peak severity. By

216

contrast, using only clinically available predictors (demographics, comorbidities and clinical

217

laboratory results), the Random Forests method achieved 66% accuracy in predicting peak

218

severity. Combining clinical parameters plus proteins did not improve accuracy (71%)

219

compared to using proteomic predictors alone, suggesting that the information contained in

220

the clinical predictors is captured at the proteomic level. While we do not believe that

221

proteomic profiling is likely to enter clinical practice for risk stratification during this

222

pandemic, the features selected by the classifier can highlight proteins of biological

223

importance. We therefore interrogated the model to identify key proteins by calculating

224

feature importance metrics (Methods, Supplementary File 1e). The most important

225

proteins for indicating the presence of current or future severe disease were IL18BP, CTSD

226

(Cathepsin D), GDF15, KRT19, TNFSF11 and IL1RL1 (ST2) (Figure 7a). It is notable that

227

through this distinct analytical approach, KRT19 again emerged as a key biomarker of

228

severe disease.

229
230

Proteins associated with risk of death

231

9/55 patients in subcohort A died. We therefore sought to identify proteins associated with

232

risk of death. To leverage the dynamic nature of repeated protein measurements for

233

prediction of death, we utilised joint models, which combine linear mixed models and Cox

234

proportional hazards models [10,11] (Methods). This analysis identified 44 proteins for

235

which increased concentration was associated with increased risk of death (Figure 7b,

236

Supplementary File 1f), including CST3, IL22RA1, AZU1, CCL28 and SPON1, and 25

237

proteins for which increased concentration was associated with reduced risk of death,

238

including CD84, TNFSF12, TANK, PRKCQ and ADM.

239
240

Associations with clinical laboratory tests

241

A number of routine clinical laboratory tests have well characterised associations with

242

COVID-19 (e.g. elevated inflammatory markers, d-dimer and reduced lymphocyte count)

243

[12]. We therefore compared our proteomic data from COVID-19 patients at each timepoint

244

to contemporaneous clinical laboratory measurements using linear mixed models

245

(Methods). We found associations between plasma proteins and all clinical laboratory

246

measurements except troponin (Figure 8, Supplementary File 1g). Many of these proteins

247

were also markers of severity (e.g. IL6, KRT19, IFN-gamma and CXCL10 were strongly

248

associated with raised CRP and ferritin and reduced lymphocyte counts). Of note CCL7, a

249

monocyte chemokine that was also identified as an important marker of severity by the

250

Random Forests classifier, was associated with lower monocyte count and raised

251

inflammatory markers. Elevated neutrophil count was associated with Oncostatin-M, which

252

regulates IL6, GCSF and GMCSF production, and with the proteases MMP9 and defensin.

253
254

Longitudinal analysis reveals proteins with distinct temporal profiles according to severity

255

The immune response to infection is dynamic, and therefore snapshot measurements

256

provide only partial insights. Leveraging the dense serial sampling in our dataset (Figure 1),

257

we modelled the temporal trajectory of each protein and asked whether or not any protein

258

trajectories differed in patients with a severe/critical versus mild/moderate overall clinical

259

course. This was achieved using linear mixed models that included a term for time from first

260

symptoms and a time x severity interaction term (Methods).

261
262

178 proteins displayed a significant association with time from first symptoms (5% FDR),

263

demonstrating the temporal variability in plasma proteins across the disease course

264

(Supplementary File 1h). Moreover, we identified 32 proteins for which there was

265

significant interaction between time and severity, i.e. proteins displaying differential temporal

266

trajectories between mild/moderate and severe/critical infections (Supplementary File 1h,

267

Figure 9). Among the proteins with the strongest temporal differences according to clinical

268

course were the integrins ITGA11 and ITGB6, the adhesion molecule ICAM1, TNFRSF10B

269

(a receptor for TRAIL) and PLAUR, the receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator. Most

270

of these proteins exhibited rising profiles in the more severe patients but flat profiles in milder

271

cases. ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, also displayed this pattern (Figure 9). In

272

contrast, abundance of ITGA11, which was also identified as reduced in the analysis of

273

infected versus non-infected patients, fell over time in the severe group.

274
275

Testing for proteins associated with ethnicity

276

In the UK, individuals from ethnic minorities are at higher risk of severe disease and death

277

from COVID-19 [4]. We therefore examined whether any of the proteins we measured

278

exhibited differences across ethnicities, analysing COVID-19 positive cases and controls

279

separately (Methods). In COVID-19 negative ESKD patients, no proteins were significantly

280

associated with ethnicity in a multivariable model adjusting for age and sex. In COVID-19

281

positive ESKD patients, there is the potential for protein associations with ethnicity to be

282

confounded by disease severity. To account for this, we included severity as well as age and

283

sex as covariates. A single protein, LY75, was associated with ethnicity in this multivariable

284

model (nominal P 0.0001, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P 0.04, with higher levels in white

285

patients). Using the same within cases analysis strategy in subcohort B, we found no

286

proteins were significantly associated with ethnicity after multiple testing correction, although

287

the nominal P value for LY75 was 0.025. While these analyses failed to identify substantial

288

ethnicity-related variation in the proteins we measured, an important caveat is that there

289

were relatively modest numbers of individuals from each ethnic group, and so statistical

290

power was limited. Larger multi-ethnic studies are needed to adequately address this

291

question.

292
293

Comparisons to other proteomic studies in COVID-19

294

Other studies have used a variety of proteomic platforms to investigate COVID-19. We

295

compared our findings to those of 3 published studies [13–15] and a preprint by Filbin et al

296

[16]. Of the 221 proteins that were differentially abundant in our analysis of COVID-19

297

positive versus negative ESKD patients, 116 associations had been previously reported

298

(Supplementary File 1i). Of the 203 proteins associated with severity, 165 had previously

299

been reported (Supplementary File 1j).

We focussed in more detail on the study by Filbin et al [16] because of the large sample size

302

and the breadth of proteomic assay used. This study comprised 384 patients with acute

303

respiratory distress (306 COVID-19 positive and 79 COVID-19 negative), and measured

304

1,472 proteins using the Olink Explore platform. 417 of these were also measured in our

305

study. Of the 221 proteins differentially abundant in our case/control analysis, 210 were

306

measured in their study. Of these 100 (47.6%) were significant in their analysis of COVID-19

307

positive versus negative respiratory distress. In addition, we observed strong correlation

308

(r=0.69) between the estimated log fold changes in our and their studies (Figure 4 figure

309

supplement 1). Of the 203 proteins associated with severity in our study, 192 were

310

measured in their study. 157 of these were significantly associated with severity, giving a

311

concordance of 81.8%. Thus, despite the differences in study design and clinical

312

populations, we observed notable similarities in our results and those reported by Filbin et al

313

[16].

Discussion

316
317

In this study we performed plasma proteomic profiling of haemodialysis patients with COVID-

318

19. A strength of our study was that we were able to perform serial blood sampling in both

319

the outpatient and inpatient setting, including longitudinal samples from the same individual

320

before and after hospitalisation. This was possible because haemodialysis patients are

321

unable to fully isolate as they must continue to attend for regular dialysis sessions.

322

Moreover, haemodialysis patients represent an important group since ESKD is one of the

323

strongest risk factors for death from COVID-19 [4,6–8]. Data from the UK Renal Registry

324

shows that 7- and 14-day mortality for COVID-19 infected in-centre haemodialysis patients

325

was 11% and 19%, respectively [17]. Data from the Scottish Renal Registry estimates 30-

326

day mortality following a positive COVID-19 test as 22%, and as of 31 May 2020, 28.2% of

327

renal replacement therapy patients who had a positive COVID-19 test had died [18]. In our

328

local population of 1,352 in-centre haemodialysis patients, 315 patients had tested positive

329

for COVID-19 by the end of our study period (31 May 2020), of whom 53% required

330

hospitalisation and 85 (27%) died. The OpenSAFELY study [4] examined ~17 million UK

331

primary care records and linked these to the UK COVID-19 mortality register. Patients with

332

estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30ml/min/1.73m2 had a hazard ratio (HR) for

333

death of 3.56 after adjustment for age and sex.

334
335

In part, the high mortality from COVID-19 in ESKD patients likely reflects the fact that these

336

patients are enriched for cardiometabolic traits that predispose to severe COVID-19.

337

However, in multivariable analyses adjusting for these factors, impaired renal function

338

remains an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 [4]. Moreover, there is an inverse

339

relationship between renal function and risk of death from COVID-19 across the spectrum of

340

chronic kidney disease. These observations support the notion that the state of ESKD per se

341

is an important determinant of outcome in COVID-19. ESKD is well recognised as an

342

immunosuppressed state [19–21], with defects in both innate and adaptive immunity [22–

343

25]. Accordingly, ESKD confers increased vulnerability to viral infections including influenza

344

and respiratory syncytial virus [26–29]. In addition, ESKD results in a chronic low-grade

345

inflammatory state [30]. This tendency to a pro-inflammatory state, combined with reduced

346

ability to respond to viruses, may contribute to the abnormal host response to SARS-CoV-2

347

infection, producing the immunopathology that leads to severe COVID-19.

348
349

Our comparison of COVID-19 positive and negative haemodialysis patient plasma samples

350

revealed 221 proteins that were differentially abundant in COVID-19. The majority of these

351

were upregulated, with strong representation of viral response proteins (e.g. DDX58, IFNG),

352

cytokines/chemokines (e.g. IL6, CCL7, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and epithelial proteins (e.g.

353

KRT19, PSIP1) (Figure 3a). The COVID-19 negative controls in this analysis were carefully

354

matched to cases in terms of age, sex and ethnicity. However, complete matching of clinical

355

characteristics was not feasible; there were differences in the prevalence of diabetes and the

356

underlying causes of ESKD between COVID-19 positive cases and controls (Table 1).

357

Sensitivity analyses adjusting for these covariates gave highly consistent results, indicating

358

that our findings are robust. In addition, we validated our findings when we analysed serum

359

samples from a separate subcohort of COVID-19 positive ESKD patients.

360
361

ESKD is itself likely to significantly impact the plasma proteome. Previous cross-sectional

362

studies have shown that the levels of many circulating proteins have an inverse relationship

363

with eGFR [31,32]. A longitudinal study using an Olink proteomics panel (although not one

364

used in our study) found that for 74% of the 84 proteins measured, protein levels rose as

365

eGFR fell [33]. For many proteins, it is unclear whether this inverse relationship with renal

366

function reflects cause or effect. Some proteins may be increased in chronic kidney disease

367

due to reduced renal clearance, some may be elevated secondary to tissue injury or chronic

368

inflammation, and others may be drivers of renal injury. Regardless, this observation of

369

widespread changes in the blood proteome of kidney disease patients emphasises the

370

importance of using COVID-19 ESKD patients rather than healthy individuals as our control

371

group.

372
373

Analysis within COVID-19 cases revealed 203 proteins associated with disease severity, the

374

strongest of which was IL6 (Figure 3b). Association of IL6 with severe disease is well-

375

established and has already received considerable attention [34,35]. Despite promising initial

376

case reports of IL6R receptor blockade in COVID-19, convincing efficacy was not

377

demonstrated in early randomised trials [36]. More recently, the REMAP-CAP trial has

378

shown the benefit of anti-IL6R therapy when given to critically ill patients on admission to

379

intensive care units [2], indicating that IL6 does contribute to critical illness from COVID-19.

380

Our finding that IL6 was most strongly upregulated in severe disease demonstrates the

381

value of plasma proteomic profiling in identifying putative drug targets.

382
383

Members of the CCL and CXCL chemokine families (e.g. CCL2, CCL7, CCL20 and

384

CXCL10) were strongly associated with severity. Likewise, higher levels of CCL2, CCL7,

385

CCL20 and CXCL10 were associated with lower blood lymphocyte count and higher

386

inflammatory markers (CRP and ferritin) (Supplementary File 1g), which are clinical

387

markers of severe disease and poorer outcome in COVID-19 [37]. Of note, CCL20 is a

388

chemoattractant for lymphocytes [38], and its negative association with lymphocyte count

389

may reflect a direct effect on migration of lymphocytes from the blood into the tissues rather

390

than simply marking severe disease. CCL2 (also known as MCP-1) and CCL7 (MCP-3), are

391

both chemokines for monocytes, and CXCL10 has pleiotropic immunological effects

392

including chemotaxis. These chemokines were also negatively correlated with blood

393

monocyte count, suggesting recruitment of these innate immune cells into damaged tissues.

395

The neutrophil proteases PRTN3 (proteinase-3) and MPO (myeloperoxidase) (Figure 5) and

396

the neutrophil-derived protein AZU1 were associated with severe disease (Supplementary

397

File 1d), indicating that neutrophil activation and degranulation are features of severe

398

COVID-19. Degranulation of neutrophils releasing PRTN3 and MPO could potentially

399

contribute to oxidative damage in the lungs and thus more severe disease.

400
401

A striking finding of our study was the association of disease severity with upregulation of

402

epithelial proteins (e.g. KRT19) and epithelial tissue repair pathways (e.g. PSIP1, AREG,

403

GRN (progranulin)), most likely reflecting lung and vascular damage. KRT19 was notably

404

prominent in our analyses, as well as the study by Filbin et al. [16](Supplementary File 1j).

405

KRT19 is an intermediate filament protein, important for the structural integrity of epithelial

406

cells [39]. These data suggest that severe COVID-19 is characterised by destruction of the

407

lung epithelium and vascular endothelium. Vascular injury might thus explain the high level

408

of vascular thrombosis seen in patients in severe disease. In summary, our data reveal that

409

severe COVID-19 is characterised proteomically by a signature of innate immune activation

410

and epithelial injury.

411
412

69% of proteins associated with severity were also differentially abundant in the case versus

413

control analysis (Figure 6a), and for the large majority of proteins the within-cases severity

414

analysis effect size was proportional to the fold change between cases and controls (Figure

415

6b). This suggests that, in general, the distinction in the plasma proteome between severe

416

and mild COVID-19 is a quantitative difference in the COVID-19 signature, rather than there

417

being an orthogonal signature involving a different set of proteins. Consistent with this

418

concept, examination of PCA plots coloured by severity revealed that while there was a

419

gradient of COVID-19 severity, the samples from severe or critical patients did not form a

420

discrete cluster distinct from those from patients with milder disease (Figure 2 figure

421

supplement 1). However, there were a few exceptions where proteins that were associated

422

with severity were not upregulated in the case-control analysis. These included OSM, IL17C,

423

and CCL20 (Figure 6c). These proteins therefore reflect biological processes specifically of

424

severe disease and may represent therapeutic targets.

425
426

Survival analysis identified 44 proteins associated with increased risk of death (Figure 7b).

427

As expected, many of these were also associated with disease severity, high CRP and lower

428

lymphocyte count (Figure 7 figure supplement 1). In contrast, 25 proteins were associated

429

with reduced risk of death (Figure 7b). One such protein is the multi-functional cytokine

430

TNFSF12 (TWEAK). Although TWEAK can exert pro-inflammatory effects, it also can inhibit

431

the innate immune response [40] and promote tissue repair and endothelial cell proliferation

432

and survival [41], which may be beneficial responses in COVID-19. This illustrates that

433

although proteins associated with inflammation are often thought to be destructive, the

434

inflammatory response also induces a programme for limiting injury and initiating tissue

435

repair. Insufficient activation of such homeostatic mechanisms may contribute to why some

436

individuals get severe COVID-19.

437
438

The host immune response to COVID-19 is a dynamic process, and clinical deterioration

439

typically occurs 7-10 days after first symptoms. Temporal information may therefore be

440

important in determining optimum timing of therapeutic intervention (e.g. blockade of a

441

particular cytokine). By taking serial samples and examining their patterns within individuals

442

over time, we were able to model protein trajectories and found that many proteins display

443

temporal variability during COVID-19. Longitudinal measurements also allow molecular

444

comparison of severe versus mild disease trajectories. By modelling the interaction term

445

between time from first symptoms and overall disease course, we found 32 proteins that

446

displayed distinct temporal profiles in severe vs mild disease. These results point to

447

enhanced leucocyte-endothelial cell interactions indicated by upregulation of cell adhesion

448

molecules (e.g. ITGB6, ICAM1) in severe disease. This endothelial activation may contribute

449

to COVID-19-associated thrombosis discussed above. Management of thrombosis in

450

COVID-19 currently consists of anticoagulation. Our results suggest that disrupting

451

leucocyte-endothelial interactions may be a complementary therapeutic strategy.

452
453

Several proteins associated with either risk of death or clinical severity lie in pathways

454

targeted by existing drugs. PARP1 was identified as an important marker of current or future

455

severe COVID-19, and also was associated with risk of death. PARP1 is associated with

456

inflammatory and vascular disease [42]. PARP1 inhibitors are in use for cancer [43], and our

457

data suggest that re-purposing of PARP1 inhibition in COVID-19 should be explored further.

458

IL33 was associated with both risk of death and clinical severity, and its receptor IL1RL1

459

(ST2) was associated with clinical severity and identified as an important predictor of severe

460

clinical course. Monoclonal antibodies against IL33 and its receptor are in late-stage

461

development for asthma [44], and could also be explored in COVID-19. As discussed above,

462

MPO was associated with clinical severity. MPO inhibitors [45] might have a role in reducing

463

neutrophil-mediated tissue injury in COVID-19. Finally, inhibitors of monocyte chemokines

464

(e.g. CCL2) and their receptors have been developed [46,47], although drugging these

465

pathways is made more challenging by molecular cross-talk. An important caveat is that we

466

cannot determine whether the associations we observed are drivers of pathology in COVID-

467

19 or simply reflect the downstream consequences of inflammation and tissue injury. Future

468

studies using Mendelian randomisation analysis will provide a useful tool for assessing

469

causality and prioritizing drug targets.

470
471

Other groups have studied the plasma or serum proteome in COVID-19 [13–16,48], using

472

either mass spectrometry or immunoassays including the Olink platform. Mass spectrometry

473

is less sensitive than immunoassays and so it likely to be unable to detect many of the

474

cytokines measured here. Conversely, it can provide complementary information by

475

measuring many proteins that our immunoassays did not target. A limitation of our study was

476

that we used Olink panels that measured specific proteins selected on their relevance to

477

inflammation, immunity, cardiovascular and metabolic disease. This bias precluded formal

478

pathway enrichment analysis. In general, our results had greater similarities to studies that

479

used immunoassays over mass spectrometry (Supplementary File 1i-j). 47.6% of proteins

480

differentially expressed in COVID-19 positive versus negative ESKD patients in our study

481

were differentially expressed in COVID-19 positive versus negative acute respiratory distress

482

syndrome patients in the study of Filbin et al [16], who used a different Olink proteomics

483

platform. Moreover, we observed consistent effect sizes (Figure 4 figure supplement 1).

484

These similarities are striking given the difference in clinical populations and control groups;

485

in Filbin et al’s report the controls included patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory infections

486

whereas our control group did not have active infection. The concordance in proteins

487

associated with COVID-19 severity within cases was even higher (81.8%). The similarities

488

suggests a similar plasma proteomic signature of COVID-19 across different clinical

489

populations, particularly the signature associated with severity.

490
491

In summary, this study reveals proteins associated with COVID-19 infection and severity,

492

and demonstrates altered dynamic profiles between patients with severe disease and those

493

with a more indolent course. Our results emphasise the importance of studying and targeting

494

mechanisms that reduce the lung epithelial and endothelial damage to both alleviate the

495

severity of the infection and to reduce the chance of long-lasting complications. These data

496

provide a valuable resource for therapeutic target prioritisation.

505

Research Wales (HCRW) Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/WA/0123: The impact

506

of COVID-19 on patients with renal disease and immunosuppressed patients). Ethical

507

approval was given.

508
509

Subcohort A: We recruited 55 COVID-19 positive haemodialysis patients, either as

510

outpatients or as inpatients (Table 1). All patients were receiving in-centre outpatient

511

haemodialysis prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 was confirmed in all cases with

512

positive nasal PCR for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Patients were recruited during the first UK

513

national lockdown, with recruitment from 8th April – 30th May 2020. Blood was collected in

514

EDTA tubes and centrifuged to obtain plasma, and stored at –80oC. Sample processing was

515

performed within 4 hours of venepuncture. The initial sample was taken as an outpatient for

516

30 patients and as an inpatient for 25. Where feasible, serial blood samples were taken. In

517

total, 259 samples were taken (3 subsequently failed QC – see below). The median number

518

of serial samples was 5 (range 1-10) (Figure 1 figure supplement 1d). 8 patients who were

519

recruited as outpatients were subsequently admitted to hospital with COVID-19 over the

520

course of the study. 27 of 55 (49.1%) patients had severe or critical disease (defined by

521

peak WHO severity). 9 (16.4%) patients died.

522
523

In addition, we recruited 51 COVID-19 negative haemodialysis controls. COVID-19 negative

524

haemodialysis controls were selected to mirror the cases in terms of demographic features

525

(age, sex, ethnicity) (Figure 1 figure supplement 1a-c). These control patients had no

526

clinical features of any other infection.

527
528

Subcohort B: We also recruited a separate set of 46 COVID-19 positive haemodialysis

529

patients (Table 2). These patients were recruited from the same centre, but slightly earlier

530

than subcohort A (recruitment commenced on 30th March 2020). For these patients, blood

531

was collected in serum tubes and centrifuged to obtain serum. At this time, we had very

532

limited access to laboratory facilities and so plasma was not collected from these patients. 5

533

were outpatients and 41 were inpatients, reflecting the fact that UK policy was weighted

534

towards inpatient testing at the time these patients were recruited. 33 of 46 patients (71.7%)

535

had severe or critical disease (by peak WHO severity), and 9 (19.6%) patients died. For 40

536

patients, only one sample from a single timepoint was collected, and for 6 patients, 2

537

samples were collected. To provide controls for subcohort B, we used serum samples from

538

11 non-infected haemodialysis patients (collected at the same time as plasma from a subset

539

of the ESKD control group described above).

Clinical severity scores

542

Severity scoring was performed based on WHO classifications (WHO clinical management

543

of COVID-19: Interim guidance 27 May 2020) adapted for clinical data available from

544

electronic medical records. ‘Mild’ was defined as COVID-19 symptoms but no evidence of

545

pneumonia and no hypoxia. ‘Moderate’ was defined as symptoms of pneumonia or hypoxia

546

with oxygen saturation (SaO2) greater than 92% on air, or an oxygen requirement no greater

547

than 4L/min. ‘Severe’ was defined as SaO2 less than 92% on air, or respiratory rate more

548

than 30 per minute, or oxygen requirement more than 4L/min. ‘Critical’ was defined as organ

549

dysfunction or shock or need for high dependency or intensive care support (i.e. the need for

550

non-invasive ventilation or intubation). Severity scores were charted throughout a patient’s

551

illness. We defined the overall severity/clinical course for each patient as the peak severity

552

score that occurred during the patient’s illness.

553
554

Proteomic assays

555

Plasma and serum proteomic measurements were performed using Olink proximity

556

extension immunoassays (https://www.olink.com/products/). Five 92-protein multiplex Olink

557

panels were run (‘inflammation’, ‘immune response’, ‘cardiometabolic’, ‘cardiovascular 2’ and

558

‘cardiovascular 3’), resulting in 460 measurements per sample. Since a small number of

559

proteins were measured on more than one panel, we measured a total of 436 unique

560

proteins. The Olink assays were run using 88 samples/plate. All plates were run in a single

561

batch. Plate layouts was carefully designed to avoid confounding of potential plate effects

562

with biological or clinical variables of interest. To achieve this, we used an experimental

563

design that combined ensuring case/control balance across plates with random selection of

564

samples from each category and random ordering of allocation to wells. This is outlined in

565

more detail as follows. We ensured that each plate contained a mixture of control and case

566

samples. Specifically, a fixed proportion of each plate was designated for control samples.

567

The allocation of specific control samples to each plate was performed using randomisation.

568

For the case samples, we again used randomisation for plate assignment, with the constraint

569

that once one sample from a given patient was allocated to a plate, all other longitudinal

570

samples from that patient were assigned to same plate. Finally, once all the samples had

571

been allocated to plates, the layout of samples within each plate was determined through a

572

further randomisation step for well allocation.

573
574

Protein annotation

575

We used the Human Protein Atlas version 20.0 [49] for protein annotation (Figure 1 figure

576

supplement 2). We performed enrichment analysis of the 436 proteins that we measured

577

using string-db [50].

579

Normalisation and quality assessment and control

580

The data was normalised using standard Olink workflows to produce relative protein

581

abundance on a log2 scale (‘NPX’). Quality assessment was performed by a) examination of

582

Olink internal controls, and b) inspection of boxplots, relative log expression (RLE) plots [51]

583

and PCA. Following these steps, 3 poor quality samples were removed. In addition, 5

584

samples failed quality control on a single proteomic panel only, with the remaining panels

585

passing QC. For these samples, proteins on the panel that failed QC were set to missing,

586

and the data for the remaining proteins was retained.

587
588

Principal components analysis revealed no substantial impact of plate effects (Figure 2

589

figure supplement 2). 13 proteins were assayed more than once due to their inclusion in

590

multiple Olink panels. For plasma, the median correlation between the assays was 0.986

591

with an IQR of 0.974-0.993 and a range of 0.925 to 0.998. For serum, the median correlation

592

between the assays was 0.991 with an IQR of 0.952-0.995 and a range of 0.737-0.999. We

593

removed duplicate assays at random prior to subsequent analyses.

594
595

For 11 ESKD controls, we had contemporaneous plasma and serum samples. To assess the

596

comparability of these two matrices, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient

597

between the assays for each protein (Supplementary File 1k). 344/436 (78.9%) of proteins

598

had a Pearson’s r > 0.5. We also report the variance of each protein in plasma and serum

599

since low correlation may reflect low variance. The proteins with the lowest estimated

600

Pearson correlation coefficient were AZU1, STK4 and TANK. We highlight that this

601

comparison had small sample size (only 11 samples) and that the samples were from control

602

patients without infection. Caution should be made in extrapolating these findings to the

603

context of active infection where protein dynamic ranges may be different.

604
605

Missing values

606

Following QC, 0.22% data points were missing for the plasma dataset and 0.35% for the

607

serum dataset. For analyses that required no missing values (PCA and supervised learning),

608

we imputed missing values as follows. The dataset was first scaled and centred, and missing

609

values imputed using caret’s k-nearest neighbours (kNN) method [52]. The 5 closest

610

samples (by Euclidean distance) were used to estimate each missing value.

611
612

Principal Components Analysis

613

Singular value decomposition was used to perform PCA on the proteomic data from

614

subcohort A (plasma samples). We then used the loadings from subcohort A together with

615

the proteomic data from subcohort B to calculate principal components scores. This enabled

616

projection of subcohort B data into the PCA space of subcohort A.

617
618

Differential protein abundance analysis: COVID-19 positive versus negative

619

Differential protein abundance analyses between COVID-19 positive and negative samples

620

were performed using linear mixed models, to account for the use of serial samples from the

621

same individuals (R lme4 package [53]). This analysis compared 256 samples from 55

622

COVID-19 patients with 51 non-infected patients (1 sample per non-infected patients). Age,

623

sex and ethnicity were included as covariates. We used a random intercept term to estimate

624

the variability between individuals in the study and account for repeated measures. The

625

regression model in R notation was:

626

NPX ~ covid_status + sex + age + ethnicity + (1 | individual)

627

where NPX represents the protein abundance and covid_status was a categorical variable

628

(infected/non-infected). Sex and ethnicity were also categorical variables. Age was a

629

quantitative variable. We calculated P values using a type 3 F test in conjunction with

630

Satterthwaite’s method for estimating the degrees of freedom for fixed effects [54]. The

631

regression model was fitted for each of the 436 proteins individually. Multiple testing

632

correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and a 5% FDR used for the

633

significance threshold.

634
635

The same approach was used for subcohort B. This analysis comprised 52 serum samples

636

from 46 COVID-19 positive patients versus 11 samples from non-infected patient samples (1

637

sample per non-infected patient).

638
639

As sensitivity analyses, we repeated the differential abundance analyses between case and

640

controls for the subcohort A adjusting for additional covariates and comparing this to the

641

basic model (i.e. using age, sex, and ethnicity alone). This was performed for each of the

642

following parameters: diabetes status, cause of ESKD, and time to last haemodialysis.

643
644

Testing for associations between proteins and clinical severity

645

For testing the association of plasma proteins with the 4-level WHO severity rating (mild,

646

moderate, severe and critical) within COVID-19 positive cases from subcohort A (n=256

647

samples from 55 patients), we used a similar linear mixed modelling approach to the COVID-

648

19 positive versus negative differential abundance analysis; for this analysis, the

649

covid_status term was replaced by a severity variable encoded using orthogonal polynomial

650

contrasts to account for ordinal nature of severity levels. As before, age, sex and ethnicity

651

were included as covariates. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the analysis with time to

652

last haemodialysis (days) as an additional covariate.

653
654

Testing for associations between proteins and clinical laboratory tests

655

The linear mixed modelling strategy was also employed for testing association of temporal

656

clinical laboratory variables and protein levels, with the value of the clinical variable (as a

657

quantitative trait) used in place of covid_status. Only COVID-19 positive patients were

658

included in this analysis. Contemporaneous lab measurements were not available for all

659

samples. This varied according to the clinical lab parameter. Some (eg troponin, d-dimer)

660

were measured less frequently than full blood count and CRP. Details of the proportion of

661

missing values for each lab parameter are included in (Supplementary File 1g). We also

662

calculated correlations between clinical laboratory variables and protein levels using the R

663

package rmcorr, which determines the overall within-individual relationship among paired

664

measures that have been taken on two or more occasion [55].

665
666

Testing for associations between proteins and ethnicity

667

We performed testing of protein levels and ethnicity separately in COVID-19 negative ESKD

668

patients and COVID-19 positive ESKD patients. These analyses were limited to individuals

669

who were White, South Asian (Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi ancestry) or Black as there

670

were too few individuals from other ethnic groups for meaningful interpretation. For COVID-

671

19 negative patients (1 sample per patient), we performed linear regression for each protein

672

with ethnicity as the predictor variable, and age and sex as covariates. For COVID-19

673

positive patients we used a linear mixed model to account for serial samples from the same

674

individual, again with age, and sex as covariates.

675
676

Multiple testing correction

677

We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the FDR at 5% for all statistical

678

analyses.

679
680

Alternative estimation of the FDR using the plug-in method

681

To provide additional support that the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was providing

682

adequate control of the FDR, we also used the plug-in method of Tibshirani [9] as an

683

alternative method to estimate the FDR, as described below.

684

1. We defined R as the number of associations declared significant in the real data.

685

2. We defined C as the test statistic used as the significance threshold used in the real data

686

(i.e. that corresponding to an adjusted p-value of 0.05).

687

3. The expected number of proteins that we would find significant under the null hypothesis

688

that no proteins are differentially abundant between COVID-19 positive versus negative

689

patients (i.e. false positives) was estimated using a permutation strategy. We randomly

690

permuted each individuals’ COVID-19 status label 100,000 times and, in each case,

691

repeated the differential abundance analysis on the permuted data.

692

number of false positives (ܸ෠ ) was then estimated by the number of associations with test

693

statistic > C in 100,000 permutations of the data, divided by the number of permutations.

694

4. The estimated FDR was then calculated as ܸ෠ /R.

The estimated the

695
696

We implemented a similar approach for the testing the association of proteins with severity

697

scores within cases.

698
699

Using this method, the estimated FDR for the case versus control analysis was 0.062 and for

700

the severity analysis 0.057, indicating that we had appropriately controlled the FDR.

701
702

Empirical p-value calculation

703

As a complementary analysis, based on the approach of Filbin et al. [16], we estimated the

704

empirical P-value for the likelihood of observing as many significant proteins as we identified

705

in the real data if the null hypothesis of no differentially abundant proteins in cases versus

706

controls were true. We again used 100,000 permutations of the case control labels to

707

estimate the null distribution. We performed Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment on the nominal

708

p-values of each permutation, and counted the number of proteins that were significant

709

(adjusted p-value <0.05) in each permutation.

710

The distribution of the number of proteins declared significant is shown in Figure 3 figure

711

supplement 2a; on no occasion in 100,000 permutations did we observe more proteins

712

declared significant than in the real data. We can thus state that the empirical P-value (the

713

fraction of permutation runs where we observed ≥ the number of associations in the real

714

data) is less than 1/100,000 = 1x10-5.

715
716

We also applied this method to the association testing of proteins with severity scores within

717

cases (Figure 3 figure supplement 2b). Again, on no occasion in 100,000 permutations did

718

we observe more proteins declared significant than in the real data (empirical p-value <1x10-

719

5

).

722

Random forest models were fit using R’s randomForest and caret packages [52,56]. Data

723

was centred, scaled and imputed as in Data Preparation with the caveat that, during cross-

724

validation, the pre-processing procedure was first applied on the resampled (training) data

725

before the same method was applied without re-calculation to the holdout (test) set. To

726

estimate model accuracy, we used 4-fold cross-validation. The cross-validation procedure

727

was repeated 100 times. The model’s parameters were kept constant at 500 trees and an

728

mtry value (number of proteins randomly sampled as candidates at each node) calculated as

729

the square root of the number of features. After parameter estimation, we fit a final model

730

trained using the entirety of the dataset. This model was used for subsequent feature

731

extraction.

732

randomForestExplainer package. We made use of the following importance measures:

733

accuracy decrease (the average decrease in prediction accuracy upon swapping out a

734

feature), number of trees (the number of trees with a node corresponding to a feature) and

735

mean minimal depth (the average depth at which a node corresponding to a feature occurs).

736

Three models were generated with different input features: i) proteomic data alone; ii) clinical

737

parameters alone; iii) proteomic data and clinical parameters. Clinical parameters included

738

sex, age, ethnicity, cause of ESKD, comorbidities, smoking status, radiological evidence of

739

pulmonary infiltrates, and clinical laboratory tests.

741

Survival analysis using joint modelling

742

Following scaling and centering, we fit linear mixed models for each protein to capture the

743

temporal trajectories of each individual. A polynomial spline of degree 2 was used to model

744

protein concentration with respect to time (from symptom onset, measured in days); the

745

spline was fitted for samples that were taken between 1 and 28 days from first symptoms,

746

inclusive. Proteomic data after that point was censored. We estimated both random

747

intercepts and random slopes for each individual, as per the following R formula notation:

748

NPX ~ time + (time | individual)

749

These were joined to a Cox regression model using the jointModel package [11] in order to

750

estimate the association of each protein with risk for death. P values were calculated using a

751

Wald test for the association between the linear mixed model and Cox regression.

752

Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was applied, with an adjusted p-value of 0.05 used as the

753

significance threshold.

754
755

Longitudinal analysis

756

We also used linear mixed models to estimate the temporal profile of each protein. For this

757

longitudinal analysis we explicitly modelled the time from first symptoms. We set up the

758

model to test for each protein a) whether the protein significantly change over time and b)

759

whether the protein changes over time differently in individuals with a mild versus severe

760

disease course. The latter was performed statistically by testing for an interaction effect

761

between time and clinical course. For the purposes of this analysis, we binarised patients

762

into severe or non-severe clinical course according to the peak WHO severity disease of

763

their illness. Patients with a peak WHO score of mild or moderate were considered non-

764

severe and those with a peak score of severe or critical were considered severe.

765
766

We then used R’s bs function to fit a polynomial spline of degree 2 to model protein

767

concentration with respect time (from symptom onset, measured in days) [57]. The spline

768

was fit for samples that were taken between 1 and 21 days from symptom onset, inclusive.

769

We estimated random slopes with respect to time, in addition to random intercepts, to

770

account for each individual’s unique disease course. For each protein, we fitted the following

771

model (R notation):

772

NPX ~ time * severity + sex + age + ethnicity + (time | individual)

773

To identify proteins that changed significantly over time, we examined the P-values for the

774

main effect of time. To identify proteins with distinct temporal profiles between severe and

775

non-severe cases, we examined the P values for the time x severity interaction term. For

776

each of these two research questions, P-values were adjusted for the multiple proteins

777

tested using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and 5% FDR used as the significance

778

threshold.

a) Overlap between the proteins significantly differentially expressed in COVID-19 (n=256
COVID-19 samples and 51 non-infected samples) versus those associated with severity
(within cases analysis, n=256 samples) (subcohort A). 5% FDR was used as the significant
cut-off in both analyses.
b) Comparison of effect sizes for each protein in the COVID-19 positive versus negative
analysis (x-axis) and severity analysis (y-axis). Each point represents a protein. Pearson’s r
is shown.
c) Examples of proteins specifically associated with severity but not significantly differentially
abundant in the comparison of all cases versus controls. Violin plots showing distribution of
plasma protein levels according to COVID-19 status at the time of blood draw. Boxplots
indicate median and interquartile range. n=256 samples from 55 COVID-19 patients and 51
samples from non-infected patients. WHO severity indicates the clinical severity score of the
patient at the time the sample was taken. Mild n=135 samples; moderate n=77 samples;
severe n=29 samples; critical n= 15 samples.
Figure 7 – Prediction of severe COVID-19 and death.
a) The 12 most important proteins for predicting overall clinical course (defined by peak
COVID-19 WHO severity) using Random Forests supervised learning. If a variable is
important for prediction, it is likely to appear in many decision trees (number of trees) and be
close to the root node (i.e. have a low minimal depth). The mean minimal depth across all
trees (white box) was used as the primary feature selection metric.
b) Proteins that are significant predictors of death (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p <0.05).
n=256 samples from 55 COVID-19 positive patients, of whom 9 died. Risk coefficient
estimates are from a joint model. Bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. For proteins with a
positive risk coefficient, a higher concentration corresponds to a high risk of death, and vice
versa for proteins with negative coefficients.
Figure 7 figure supplement 1 – proteins associated with risk of death: correlation to
clinical severity and clinical laboratory measurements.
Proteins significantly associated with risk of death (5% FDR) are shown. The estimated
effect size from the linear mixed model testing association with severity are also shown.
Correlations between protein levels and contemporaneous clinical laboratory marker values
were calculated using rmcorr [55] for each of the proteins significant (5% FDR) in the joint
model. The rows and columns of the clinical marker correlation matrix are ordered by
hierarchical clustering.
Figure 8 – Associations of clinical laboratory markers with plasma proteins.
Proteins that are positively (red) or negatively (blue) associated with clinical laboratory
parameters (5% FDR). P-values from differential abundance analysis using linear mixed
models after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment. Dark-grey = non-significant. Two associations
were found for d-dimer (not shown- see Supplementary File 1g).
Figure 9 – Modelling of temporal protein trajectories.
The top 18 proteins displaying the most significantly (5% FDR) different longitudinal
trajectories between patients with a mild or moderate (n= 28) versus severe or critical (n=
27) overall clinical course (defined by peak WHO severity). Means and 95% confidence
intervals for each group, predicted using linear mixed models (Methods), are plotted. The
remainder of significant proteins are shown in Figure 9 figure supplement 1. Individual
data points are shown in Figure 9 figure supplement 2.
Figure 9 figure supplement 1– display of modelled temporal trajectories for other
proteins with a significant time x severity interaction. Proteins significant at 5% FDR but
not shown in Figure 9 are displayed here.

Supplementary File 1 table legends.
Supplementary File 1a. Protein Annotation.
List of the 436 proteins measured. GeneID = gene symbol of the gene encoding the protein (used as
the main identifier in the manuscript); UniProt = UniProt ID; Olink Assay Name = protein id used by
Olink; Protein Name = full protein name; Panel name = the name of the 92 protein multiplex Olink
panel on which the protein was measured.
Supplementary File 1b. Enrichment of Reactome terms for the entire set of proteins measured.
The results of enrichment testing for genes corresponding to all 436 measured proteins against the
background of the genome. The analysis was performed against the Reactome pathways using
string-db. The list of Reactome terms is ordered by the number of proteins associated with the term.
Supplementary File 1c. Differential abundance analysis for COVID-19 positive vs negative
ESKD patients in subcohort A and B.
Summary statistics for all 436 proteins are shown. Pvalue = nominal p-value from linear mixed model.
Adjusted Pvalue = p-values after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Fold change = estimated fold
change from regression coefficient. Proteins are ordered based on results in subcohort A: first by
whether they are significant or not (at 5% FDR), then by fold change (from positive to negative). Note
the associations are not ordered by p-value so strong associations do not necessarily appear at the
top of the table. Significant adjusted p-values are coloured in green and non-significant in grey.
Estimated fold changes are coloured in a gradient from red to blue for up or downregulated in COVID19 +ve versus –ve, respectively.
Sample size for subcohort A: n= 256 plasma samples from 55 COVID-19 positive ESKD patients,
versus n= 51 ESKD controls (1 sample per control patient).
Sample size for subcohort B: 52 samples from 55 COVID-19 patients and 11 non-infected patient
samples (single time-point).
Supplementary File 1d Associations of proteins and COVID-19 severity (subcohort A).
Summary statistics for all 436 proteins are shown. Pvalue = nominal p-value from linear mixed model.
Adjusted Pvalue = p-values after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Fold change = estimated fold
change from regression coefficient. Proteins are ordered first by whether they are significant or not (at
5% FDR), then by linear gradient (effect size) from positive to negative. Note the associations are not
ordered by p-value so strong associations do not necessarily appear at the top of the table.
Supplementary File 1e. Predictors of clinical course from Random Forests.
Importance metrics for each protein for prediction according to a random forest model trained to
predict current or future severe/critical disease using the first sample of each patient. Proteins are
ordered by mean minimal depth across all trees – this was used as the primary importance metric.
Supplementary File 1f. Proteomic predictors of fatal COVID-19.
Summary statistics from joint models for fatal disease. Results for all 436 proteins are shown. “Is
significant” indicates significance (green) or not (grey) at 5% FDR. The association coefficient for
each protein indicates the direction and magnitude of the estimated log relative risk for death (red
indicates higher protein levels increase risk of death, blue the opposite). 95% confidence intervals are
plotted.
Supplementary File 1g. Associations of proteins and clinical laboratory measurements.
Clinical variable = clinical lab tests: white cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, monocyte
count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, d-dimer, troponin.
Supplementary File 1h. Longitudinal proteomic profiling with linear mixed models.
Summary statistics from the linear mixed models used to identify proteins with differential temporal
trajectories between mild/moderate (n=28) and severe/critical COVID-19 patients (n=27). Summary

Pvalue = nominal p-value from linear mixed model for the interaction term between time from
symptom onset (days) and overall WHO severity (as a binary variable: mild-moderate or severecritical).
Adjusted Pvalue = p-values after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. “Is significant” indicates significance
(green) or not (grey) at 5% FDR.
Supplementary File 1i. Comparison to other proteomic studies of COVID-19 positive vs
negative patients.
Proteins that were differentially abundant in COVID-19 +ve vs -ve patients in our data are listed (5%
FDR). TRUE indicates that the protein was reported as differentially abundant in the relevant previous
proteomic study. The final column summarises whether the association was previously reported in
any of the 4 studies. We have not harmonised significance thresholds between studies: we simply
report whether the authors declared the protein significant by the threshold of their study.
Supplementary File 1j. Comparison to other proteomic studies of COVID-19 severity.
Proteins that were associated with severity in our data are listed (5% FDR). TRUE indicates that the
protein was reported as associated with severity in the relevant previous proteomic study. The final
column summarises whether the association was previously reported in any 1 or more of the 4
studies. We have not harmonised significance thresholds between studies: we simply report whether
the authors declared the protein significant by the threshold of their study.
Results are shown for all 436 proteins against all 8 lab measurements.
Adjusted p-value = p-value from linear mixed model after Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
Gradient indicates effect size and direction. A positive gradient (red) indicates higher concentrations
of proteins are associated with higher clinical laboratory measurements. “Is significant” indicates
significance (green) or not (grey) at 5% FDR.
Contemporaneous clinical laboratory tests were not available for all plasma samples. The proportion
of samples for which contemporaneous lab tests were available were: white cell count 66%,
neutrophils 66%, monocytes 66%, lymphocytes 66%, CRP 64%, ferritin 36%, troponin 35%, d-dimer
30%.
Supplementary File 1k. Per protein correlations between plasma and serum levels derived
from the same blood sample in 11 COVID-19 negative ESKD patients.
Plasma and serum were taken from 11 non-infected ESKD patients that were measured in both
subcohort A (plasma) and B (serum). Pearson’s r was calculated for the 11 paired measurements for
each protein. Proteins are ordered by r value; this column is coloured from red to blue for positive and
negative r values, respectively. 95% confidence intervals are reported. We also report the variance of
the NPX levels for each protein in plasma and in serum.
