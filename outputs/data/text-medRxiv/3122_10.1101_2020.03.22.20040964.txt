Abstract:
The corona virus disease -2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a massive global public health
havoc. Recent published clinical trials show conflicting data for use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine
for COVID-19. This study meticulously evaluated the various dosages of chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine utilized in clinical trials registered in Chinese and US clinical trial registries for the
treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the results of published clinical trials and
in vitro studies using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine relevant to the disease are discussed.

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease of potential zoonotic origin
(1). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus – 2, (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological
agent of COVID-19, can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, including severe
respiratory illness (1). The public health concerns caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 was
declared as a “public health emergency of international concern” on 31 January and “pandemic on 11
March 2020 by World Health Organization (2). Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are currently
‘skyrocketing’ across the globe, causing enormous public health havoc and a colossal economic crisis.
The spread of COVID-19 is so accelerating that it needed sixty seven days from the first diagnosed
case to reach the first 100,000 cases, eleven days for the second 100,000 cases, four days for the
third 100,000 cases, three days for the fourth 100,000 cases and just extra seven days for additional
400,000 cases around the globe. A similar pattern has been seen in the fatality as it required
seventeen days from the first death reported on 11 January 2020 to reach the first 100 deaths, thirty
days for the 1,000 deaths, sixty one days for the 5,000 deaths and sixty eight days for 10,000 deaths
and just nine additional days for additional 20,000 deaths. By 1 April 2020, the number of confirmed
cases skyrocketed to approximately 823,000 and 40,598 deaths from 205 countries and
territories around the globe (3). In the single day of 31 March, there were approximately 72,700 new
confirmed cases and 4,193 deaths reported across the world (3). The reported mortality rate for
COVID-19 is around 3% (4) and the mortality rates vary depending on geographical regions, age
distributions and co-morbidities (5). Recently, the Chinese Government included chloroquine
phosphate in the list of antiviral therapies for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia or COVID19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its 6th and 7th
versions of official Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia caused by
COVID-19 (6,7). Immediate research on the potential therapeutic application for the disease can

save lives and prevent from the rapid viral transmission. Chloroquine phosphate is an old drug used
for the treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium species (8). Chloroquine phosphate can also be
replaced with another member of its family, hydroxychloroquine. The active compound chloroquine
constitutes 60% in chloroquine phosphate and 77.5% in hydroxychloroquine respectively.
Mechanism of actions of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been studied for both SARS-CoV and
SARS-C0V-2. A study using Vero E6 cells found that treatment of the cells with chloroquine either
before or after infection with SARS-CoV could prevent infection or treat the infected cells suggesting
both prophylactic and therapeutic effect (8). The study found chloroquine disturbed the biochemical
maturation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for SARS-CoV, and
increased the pH of intracellular virus-laden vesicles inhibiting the viral normal multiplication processes.
The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is also highly predicted of being ACE2 (1). In vitro studies for SARSCoV-2 also found chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a less-toxic derivative of chloroquine to be
able to effectively inhibit viral growth (9). They found the viral biological processes in the endosomes
were affected by the anti-malarial agents. While the reported 50% effective concentration of the drugs
are higher than the normal serum concentration reported in people taking these drugs, the
concentrations in lungs and other vital organs are higher (10). The most common side-effect of
these are retinopathy and other side-effects precipitating due to higher concentrations of the
compounds in blood.
The recommended 3-day chloroquine phosphate dosage for malaria treatments for adults is 1 gm
orally followed by 500 mg after 6-8 hours in the first day and 500 mg per day for second and the third
day (8). Similarly, the 3-day dosage for hydroxychloroquine is 800 mg orally followed by 400 mg after
6-8 hours in the first day and 400 mg per day for second and third day (11). This study was
specifically conducted to examine the various dosages of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine utilized
in previous clinical trials registered and underwent for the treatment of pneumonia caused by SARSCoV-2. The guidelines by the Chinese government has postulated the dose of 500 mg twice a day for
7 days for adults aged 18-65 years and weighing more than 50 kg; and initial dose of 500 mg twice a
day for first two days and 500 mg per day for days 3 through 7 for adults of weight less than 50 kg (7).

Methods:
A systematic search of registered clinical trials was carried (Figure 1, PRISMA flow-chart). List of
clinical trials registered in China were utilized in this study accessing with a ready-made excel
spreadsheet from the Chinese clinical trial registry (12), on 30th March, 2020 provided in the
website. The list of clinical trials registered in the US government clinical trial registry (13) were
retrieved by searching “coronavirus” key word on 30th March, 2020. All the trials were filtered out
based on the presence of word “chloroquine” in the title irrespective of the chemical forms of the
molecule (hydroxychloroquine) or trials being carried alone or in combination with other antivira
therapies. Excel spreadsheet file was prepared based on various headings including intervention
groups, randomization status, sample sizes, etc. Univariate statistics were used to report the
methodologies of the trials. As of 30th March 2020, 547 trials were registered in the Chinese clinical
trial registry starting from 23rd January, 2020. 25 (4.6%, 25/547) clinical trials used the word
chloroquine in their titles. Five of them were reported to have been canceled, one was a prophylactic
study and one another could not be retrieved. Eighteen (3.3%, 18/547) clinical trials from the Chinese
registry were used for the downstream analysis. As of 30th March 2020, 184 entries were obtained by
searching for coronavirus related clinical trials in the US clinical trial registry of which only 153 were
registered after 1 January 2020. Out of 153 registrations, 20 (13.1%, 20/153) were related to use of
chloroquine. Four of these were registered from China, 3 from Brazil, 2 each from France, Mexico, US

and Canada, and 1 each from Thailand, South Korea, United Kingdom, Norway and Turkey. Two of
the studies from US, and 1 each from the United Kingdom, Mexico and Turkey were prophylactic study
for healthy people at risk of infection. Thus 15 studies from US trial registry were used for analysis.
Total 33 (18+15) clinical trials have been registered since 3rd February 2020. Six prophylactic studies
were analyzed separately.

Results:
Most of the trials used oral chloroquine (68.2%, 15/33) or hydroxychloroquine (68.2%, 15/33) singly as
treatment options, followed by chloroquine in combination with other antivirals ((13.6%, 3/33),
hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (9.1%, 2/33), chloroquine as aerosols (9.1%, 2/33), chloroquine
with azithromycin (4.5%, 1/33) and hydroxychloroquine with other antivirals (4.5%, 1/33) (Table 1). The
maximum quantity of chloroquine given was 12 g in a period of 10 days (NCT04323527) and the
lowest reported was 2.1 g aerosolized chloroquine (ChiCTR2000029975) in a duration on 7 days.
Similarly, the maximum quantity of hydroxychloroquine given was 12.4 gm in a duration of 14 days
(ChiCTR2000029868) and the lowest amount was 2 gm in a period of 5 days (NCT04261517). Only
one of the two trials using aerosolized chloroquine phosphate stated the dosage. It was 2.1 gm in a
period of 7 days (ChiCTR2000029975). All 12894 study patients are planned to be enrolled in 33 trials.
Twelve trials registered in the US registry didn’t have details about sample size allocation into
individual intervention arms. For the remaining 5842 individuals in 21 trials with information of sample
sizes, 1199 patients are to get chloroquine alone, 1050 are to get hydroxychloroquine alone 159 got
chloroquine with other drugs, 25 are to get aerosolized chloroquines, 1320 are to get conventional
treatments or placebo, and 2089 are to get other antivirals. All of the active or placebo interventions
also get conventional treatments or the standard care. Out of the 33 clinical trials, 4 reported that they
were not designed to be randomized, two were single arm studies and didn’t require randomization
and 27 reported using some kind of randomization. Out of total, three-fourth (91%, 30/33) studies set
18 years old as lower age limit for inclusion criteria while two trials used 16 years, and one trial used
30 years. Similarly, upper age limit ranged from 65 to 100 years of age. All trials reported enrolling
both genders in the study.
Among the trials using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as prophylactic agent (Table 3), 45400
healthy at-risk population are to be enrolled with the UK study by the University of Oxford, enrolling
40,000 individuals for a duration of three months with 250 mg chloroquine daily (NCT04303507) and
the least dose is planned to be given in a study in Turkey where 200 mg hydroxychloroquine is
planned to be given every three weeks along with daily vitamin C and zinc tablets) (NCT04326725).
The results of these trials, if successful, can provide low-cost option for vaccination which may require
more than a year to be available in the developing world.
Two trials from China have recently published their results (NCT04261517 and ChiCTR2000029559).
The background information in a Chinese clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029741) (14) has revealed that
fifty percent (5/10) efficacy of chloroquine phosphate (5 days medications) in COVID-19 compared to
20% (3/15) efficacy of combinatory medications of lopinavir/ritonavir (5 days medications) in Chinese
pneumonia patients in 2020.
The Chinese government in its 6th and 7th guidelines for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia
has recommended use of chloroquine phosphate at specific dosages (Table 3). Three studies
(including two mentioned earlier) have been published that assessed the efficacy of

hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. A non-randomized open-label clinical trial in France that
enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients to the hydroxychloroquine (20 patients) and control arms (16
patients) concluded a positive effect of hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin
based on viral negativity at day 6 (15). Patients who didn't consent for hydroxychloroquine, had
exclusion criteria (allergy to hydroxychloroquine, retinopathy, G6PD deficiency, QT prolongation and
breast feeding/pregnacy) and were admitted to hospitals not using hydroxychloroquine, were grouped
in the controlled arm. Six patients in the case arm also received azithromycin to prevent bacterial
superinfection. Though the study had small sample size, was not randomized and didn't carry an
intention-to-treat analysis, it concluded positive effects for hydroxychloroquine arm in spite of lesser
proportion of "asymptomatic" patients (10% in hydroxychloroquine arm vs. 25% in control arm) and
higher average age (51.2 years in hydroxychloroquine arm vs 37.3 years in control arm) in the
intervention arm. Moreover, a secondary analysis (16) covering up for the weak statistical analyses
by original authors found the azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combination are was better
compared to the control arm. Another study carried an open label randomized clinical trial in 30
Chinese COVID-19 patients treated with either hydroxychloroquine (15 patients) or conventional
methods (15 patients) (17). The study concluded no apparent benefit of hydroxychloroquine
treatment compared to conventional treatment (86.7% treatment arm vs 93.3% control arm had
negative viral conversion on day 7, p>0.05). But the authors reported using interferon alfa in all of the
patients and 80% patients in each arm were treated with other antiviral therapies. Moreover, the
authors cautioned the high recovery rate in control arm due to enrollment of mild cases could impact
the comparison of efficacy of treatment arm. The third published study (as a preprint at the time of
writing this manuscript) from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China,
(ChiCTR2000029559) claimed to find an positive effect of hydroxychloroquine in a double-blind
randomized control design. 80.6% (25/31) patients in the treatment arm (400 mg
hydroxychloroquine/day for 5 days) had improved pneumonia compared to 54.8% (17/31) in the
control arms, along with other better outcome measures in the treatment arm (18). Patients in both of
the arms were reported to have been treated with other antivirals and antibiotics. A recent review
found the inclusion of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine based therapy in the national guidelines of
China, Korea, Netherlands, Italy, Canada and Belgium (19). More recently, the US Food and Drug
Administration has allowed an emergency use authorization for these drugs against COVID-19 when
used by a valid health care provider (20).

Discussion:
Modern and robust scientific interventions at national and international level for prevention,
containment and treatment has protected mankind from various deadly diseases like Ebola, Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, etc. in the contemporary
parameters. The Spanish flu about one hundred years ago claimed about up to 50 million lives (21)
as modern scientific knowledge were contemporarily lacking and limited. As predicted, in the absence
of these measures, if 60% of global population were infected as forecasted by experts, and
approximately 20% required treatment of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate
(22), the cost could range tens of thousands USD per million population (Table 3).

Currently, there are very limited information and knowledge regarding the therapeutic aspects of
COVID-19 as most of the clinical trials are still undergoing and their findings have not publicly
available yet. Touret and de Lamballerie (25) reported the scarcity of findings of clinical trials on
therapeutic aspects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. However, Gao et al. (26) in an abstract
article revealed that chloroquine phosphate had superior efficacy for controlling the inhibition of
pneumonia exacerbation, and disease progression and transmission in more than 100 Chinese
COVID-19 patients. Recent and previous in vitro studies have shown the effectiveness of chloroquine
and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 or other coonaviruses (Table 4). Thus more studies are
warranted to confirm the efficacy and safety for use of these medications.

In spite of that, continued efforts to try different dosages in ethically valid clinical trials is required for
the assessment of effective and safe dosage administration. This can importantly contribute to guide
the medical professionals for prescribing the accurate interventions and also contribute to
pharmaceutical companies for deciding appropriate manufacturing pathways. While hydroxchloroquine
has low dosage requirements and lesser side effects, the comparative price for complete prescribed
treatment is more than five times of chloroquine phosphate (24) . While malaria is endemic in poor
parts of the world, the prevalence is still too less than the panic and feared caused by prevalence of
COVID-19 prompting pharmaceuticals for scaling up for the production of chloroquine. As chloroquine
has significant adverse events, effective short-course dosing is very important. Moreover, both of
these drugs are prescribed for weeks to months for various indications (8,11) and the interventions
for short disease course (2 weeks for mild and 3-4 weeks for severe and critical cases) (22) of
COVID-19 may not significantly hamper treatment. Other antiviral drugs in pipeline may not be very
useful as their productions and supplies to the developing countries may require lengthy timeframe
whereas mass production of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is already in place in malaria
endemic developing countries.

Conclusion:
Evaluating the potentially favorable benefit-risk balance, without any choice of valid therapeutic
options left, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be applicable for the management of COVID19 in the present context of outbreak, however the respective national guidelines and clinician’s
evaluation and decision is recommended. In conclusion, chloroquine and hydroxchloroquine might
have therapeutic potential for the medication of COVID-19 in the current context of pandemic situation.
However, the corroborating evidences from these undergoing clinical trials are definitely demanded to
make the ultimate decision on COVID-19 treatment.
