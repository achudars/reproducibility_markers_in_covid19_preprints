Abstract
The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in China and
devastated a vast majority of countries. In India, COVID-19 cases are steadily increasing since
January 30, 2020, and the government-imposed lockdown across the country to curtail
community transmission. COVID-19 forecasts have played an important role in capturing the
probability of infection and the basic reproduction rate. In this study, we predicted some
trajectories of trajectories associated with COVID-19 in the coming days in India using an Autoregression integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and Richard’s model. By the end of April
2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the
ARIMA model versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there
would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will
reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) by the end of April 2020. These estimates can help to
strengthen the implementation of strategies to increase the health system capacity and enactment
of social distancing measures all over India.

Introduction
The ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in China and
devastated a vast majority of countries. Due to rapid pandemic potential and the absence of
antiviral drugs and vaccines, this contagious COVID-19 disease has recorded thousands of
deaths across the world [1]. COVID-19 placed tremendous strain on the health system and left
dilemma with large case numbers. In India, COVID-19 cases are steadily increasing since
January 30, 2020, and the government-imposed lockdown across the country to curtail
community transmission.
Mathematical models are widely used to forecast the spreading of the disease and capture the
probability of cases from susceptible to infected, and then to a recovery state or death. Many SIR
models have been published or proposed online [2-5]. However, these models assume randomly
mixed between all individuals in the given population. Nonlinear models/functions are more
advanced methods that provide solution iteratively [6]. The iterative methods such as nonlinear
regression include the modified Gauss-Newton method, gradient or steepest-descent method,
multivariate secant or false position, and the Marquardt method [6,7]. With regards to COVID19, forecasts have played an important role in capturing the probability of infection and the basic
reproduction rate. No studies have used a specific nonlinear model to forecast the COVID-19
dynamics in India. Therefore, we generated 30 days forecast the dynamics of cumulative
confirmed death and recovery of COVID-19 cases in India.

170+ countries worldwide, including state or province wise for some of the special database
cases. Here we have collected each day case data at given stipulated tie from the data of having
date January 30, 2020, to March 28, 2020. Some date wise cases for confirmation of COVID-19
reporting cases along with total cumulative results of recovered cases and death cases are
analyzed using statistical analysis. We here used Auto-regression integrated moving average
model (ARIMA) and Richard’s model in the R-language platform. The new projected data is
used up to April 29, 2020, for the creation of trajectory having projected score for the entire three
cases reported- case confirmed, recovered, and death.
Forecasting of projected prediction
Here we standardize all the models in a file format to detect the daily case for India country of
available data. Reported data that is collected from entire sources is data that is considering from
January 30, 2020, to March 28, 2020, so the projection trajectory will analyze up to April 29,
2020. The best fit analysis for India, which we included for analysis of the cumulative reported
case and its upcoming necessity in the future as well as recovery and death cases.
Statistical Models
We here used some statistical phenomenological models to detect and analyze the disease based
trajectory model for prediction purposes. We precisely used four models to analyze the aggregate
data set for time series analysis. This includes ARIMA and Richard’s model [8]. Another type of
COVID-19, like SARS disease (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), is analyzed without
breaking the current situation and predicting the future perspective [9].

Forecasting is exceptionally vital even to get the slightest result for multi variables consideration
over public health factors, especially pandemic crises like COVID-19. In this case, forecast from
single models is not enough for reliable results and prediction. Therefore, here we are using two
different models integrated for time series analyses. Hence all the two different models will be
discussed ahead [10].
Time series models provide a different and unique approach to time series forecasting. Basically,
for the time series forecast, two approaches are widely used, i.e., exponential smoothing and
Time Series Models like ARIMA and Richard’s. While exponential smoothing models are based
on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, Time Series, like ARIMA models, aims
to describe the autocorrelations in the data.
Stationarity and Differencing
A stationary time series where data properties do not depend on the time at which the series is
observed. Therefore, time-series data with trends or with seasonality are not stationary as it will
affect the value of the data at different times. In our study here, we are using machine learning
tools for predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the future, so having a stationary time series data
is very important for further predictable modeling. As we can see, the trend is followed by the
variables used in our data for the victims affected by COVID-19. Therefore, to test whether the
data is stationary or not becomes a very vital aspect of our research.
Here our time series data is based on the spread of the victims of the COVID-19 across India;
hence, finding the correlation within the variable of recovering, confirmed and death cases will
be crucial for the formation of the time series format for further modeling [11]. For another two
trends like death and recovery cases is time lagging situation. So, to detect this analysis, we

require some other statistical formulation and models. These are described, followed by how
they influence to getting the results.
Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA)
Now, here we combine differencing with auto-regression (AR) and Moving Average models
(MA). The full model can be written as:

Where y t is the differenced series, the “predictors” on the right-hand side include both lagged
′

values of yt and lagged errors. We call this an ARIMA (p,d,q) model, where, p=order of the
autoregressive part; d=degree of first differencing involved; q=order of the moving average part.
The Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a model for times series data
analysis based on their three-class components to manage stationary and non-stationary time
datasets. The first component autoregressive (AR)(p) time series model for dependent
observations for the forecast of future values. Even it is the function of dependent and dependent
lag value and with any constant as white noise.
The moving average (MA)(q) model deals with white noise observations (past forecast errors)
for the forecast for the future dependent value. Even it is the function of white noise and past
white noise error. Both the combination will make the ARMA model, which deals with
stationary data values. We are dealing with time-series non-stationary values, the data observed
value means, and variance is not constant, so third component (integrating(I)(d)) was used to
convert the observations using differencing series [12,13]. The differencing order two
observation was used for the model forecast for COVID-19 case cumulative incidence, mortality,
and recovery to avoid any misleading observed value functions.

For our study, after the pre-processing method of data smoothening and testing the database for
stationary and further for prediction modeling. Therefore, a multivariate database model for
COVID-19 with different interaction methods was applied. We put the model with double
differencing and as per lags for observed incidence (ARIMA(1,2,0)), mortality (ARIMA(0,2,2),
and recover case (Brown’s method). ACF correlation is found more suited for the database, and
therefore, the model we made for prediction of death, confirm, and recover variable separately is
ARIMA (0,2,2) [14]. This ACF plot is understated with recovery cases and plotted in Figure 4.
This will forecast observe value how the COVID-19 case causes prolonged influence, and in

SIR Model
The SIR model is one of the simplest and smartest compartmental models for epidemiology like
COVID-19. The model is composed of three compartments that represent different categories of
individuals within a population; the susceptible (S), infected (I), and removed (R). Hence it is
called as SIR Model. Here susceptible is meant by people exposed to this COVID-19, infected
comes after COVID-19 is confirmed in a person and removed means that either the person is
recovered or death due to COVID-19. Mathematical it is determined concerning time, i.e., days
here and given by:

dS/dt = -βSI
dI/dt = βSI – γI
dR/dt = γI

β = cp
Where,
S – the proportion of susceptible individuals in total population
I – the proportion of infected individuals in total population
R – the proportion of removed individuals in total population
β

– transmission parameter (rate of infection for susceptible-infected contact)

c – number of contacts each host has per unit time (contact rate)

p – the probability of transmission of infection per contact (transmissibility)
γ

– recovery parameter (rate of infected transitioning to recovered)

This model is fundamental and has important assumptions. The first being the population is
closed and fixed, in other words – no one is added into the susceptible group (no births), all
individuals who transition from being infected to removed are permanently resistant to infection
or are dead because of the disease, and there are no deaths. Second, the population is
homogenous (all individuals are the same) and only differ by their disease state. Third, infection
and that individual’s “infectiveness” or ability to infect susceptible individuals, coincides.
MODEL Validation
We are presenting the short term forecast for the reported incidence, mortality, and recovered
cases of nCOVID19 with the data incidence cases reported during the period of 30 January to 29
April 2020. The used two data model algorithm to predicted to know the outbreak of COVID19
during its next level of influence. We estimate the best-fit solution for each model using the
nonlinear least-squares fitting, in which the test model provides the better goodness of fit.
The ARIMA and Richards both of the growth models validated based on Coefficient of
determination(R2) desirable value should be higher, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), its value
should be lower, and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), the value should be lower. It provides
the information for good model fit, and results are likely to be reliable. We observed that the
ARIMA model was an excellent fit model.

Prediction Modeling
Both models are non-linear ARIMA it predicts the straight line represents the COVID-19
outbreak will grow fastly, not represent any paucity, but its upper limit and lower limits are at the
wider gap. In (b) Richards model, it is the nonlinear sigmoidal function, so it grows at a higher
slope, then it tends to become a consistently higher level with any other statistical information;
however, it upper and lower limits are also very close. The ARIMA model outperforms as a
growth model in forecasts in the short term based on performance metrics that account for the
certainty of the predictions the coverage at a 95% CI level.
The Cumulative incidence cases daily mapped, forecast short term next one month using more
than two months of observations using ARIMA and Richards growth model (Figure.1). By the
end of April 2020, the incidence of new cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002)
through ARIMA model (Figure1(a)), versus be 6378 (95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard’s model
(Figure1(b)).

The mortality case estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95% CI: 118 to 277) deaths
based on the ARIMA model (Figure2(a)) versus be 120 (95% CI: 110 to 156) for Richard’s
model (Figure2(b)).
The drop-down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245 to 758) through
ARIMA model(Figure3(a)), versus by the end of April 2020: 278 (95% CI: 116 to 380) for
Richard’s model (Figure3(b))
SIR model represents the incidence (infected), suspectable and Recovered cases using ARIMA
forecast data further spread of COVID tends cases to decrease in the epidemic incidence cases in
India. After the above analysis and generation of models for prediction of COVID-19, it has been
observed that the ARIMA model is more suited for prediction than comparing to Richard’s, and
the output has come near to accuracy as validation. It can be identified as a very frightening
future outcome; here, in this case, we predicted an overall analysis up to April 29, 2020, which
defines fewer crises for India.
The ARIMA model shows a straight line with a very high slope in the cases on incidence and
mortality and recovery case; however, Richard’s growth model in mid of forecast range it very
great change in value and finally tends to become static for incidence and mortality and
recovered cases. The ARIMA model the forecast limits are increased in the extensive limit as the
time increases; however, Richard’s growth model limits in minimal range comparatively.
These preliminary results using ARIMA and Richard’s models can help guide future efforts to
understand better the various spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other
infectious diseases.

Through our investigation, we identified that by the end of April 2020, the incidence of new
cases is predicted to be 5200 (95% CI: 4650 to 6002) through the ARIMA model versus be 6378
(95% CI: 4904 to 7851) Richard model. We estimated that there would be a total of 197 (95%
CI: 118 to 277) deaths and drop down in the recovery rates will reach around 501 (95% CI: 245
to 758) by the end of April 2020. These estimates can help to strengthen the implementation of
strategies to increase the health system capacity and enactment of social distancing measures all
