Abstract (limit 125 words).
There is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2
will unfold in coming years. These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of
immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using
data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human
betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to
simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent
wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We
summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed
to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the
duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

Main text. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has caused nearly 80,000 detected cases of
COVID-19 illness and claimed over 2,500 lives as of 24 Feb 2020 (1). With sustained
transmission reported in China, Japan, Iran, Italy, and South Korea (1), the outbreak is on the
verge of becoming a pandemic. The required intensity, duration, and urgency of public health
responses will depend on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent
transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. One possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 will follow its
closest genetic relative, SARS-CoV, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures
after causing a brief but intense epidemic (2). Increasingly, public health authorities consider
this scenario unlikely (3). Alternatively, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could resemble that of
pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (4).
Such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from
zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (5). This paper identifies viral,
environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine which scenarios in
fact play out, and identifies key data needed to distinguish between them.
The transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will depend on factors
including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission strength, the duration of immunity,
and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2
belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the SARS coronavirus, MERS
coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The SARS
and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with case fatality rates of 9 and 36%
respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (6). HCoV-OC43 and HCoVHKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold
(6). While investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing,
recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild illness with more limited
occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (7). Current COVID-19 case fatality rates in
China are estimated at 2.9% within Hubei province, and 0.4% outside (8), suggesting lower
severity than SARS and MERS but higher severity than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In terms
of transmission, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause widespread infection is more reflective of
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 than of its more clinically severe relatives. HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9,
10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true
for influenza (11–13). Immunity to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably
within one year (14), while SARS infection can induce longer-lasting immunity (15). The

betacoronaviruses can induce immune responses against one another: SARS infection can
generate neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 (15) and HCoV-OC43 infection can
generate cross-reactive antibodies against SARS (16). However, due to the novelty of the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and a relative lack of surveillance data on the existing human
coronaviruses, it has not been possible to project how the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will
unfold in the coming years, including the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the seasonal
coronaviruses.
We used data from the United States to model betacoronavirus transmission in
temperate regions and to project the possible dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the
year 2025. We first assessed the role of seasonal variation, duration of immunity, and cross
immunity on the transmissibility of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the US. We used the
weekly percentage of positive laboratory tests for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (17) multiplied
by the weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI)
(18, 19) to approximate historical betacoronavirus incidence in the US to within a scaling
constant. This proxy is proportional to incidence under a set of assumptions described in the
Materials and Methods. To quantify variation in transmission strength over time, we estimated
the weekly effective reproduction number, defined as the average number of secondary
infections caused by a single infected individual (20, 21). The effective reproduction numbers for
each of the betacoronaviruses displayed a seasonal pattern, with annual peaks in the effective
reproduction number slightly preceding those of the incidence curves (Fig S1). For both HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the effective reproduction number typically reached its peak between
October and November and its trough between February and April. Over the five seasons
included in our data (2014-2019), the median effective reproduction number was 1.11 (IQR:
0.84-1.41) for HCoV-HKU1 and 1.00 (IQR: 0.84-1.41) for HCoV-OC43. Results were similar
using various choices of incidence proxy and serial interval distributions (Fig S1, Fig S2).
To quantify the relative contribution of immunity versus seasonal forcing on the
transmission dynamics of the betacoronaviruses, we adopted a regression model (22) that
expressed the effective reproduction number for each strain (HKU1 and OC43) as the product
of a baseline transmissibility constant (related to the basic reproduction number and the
proportion of the population susceptible at the start of the season), the depletion of susceptibles
due to infection with the same strain, the depletion of susceptibles due to infection with the other
strain, and a spline to capture further unexplained seasonal variation in transmission strength
(seasonal forcing). These covariates were able to explain most of the observed variability in the
effective reproduction numbers (adjusted R2: 74.2%). The estimated multiplicative effects of

each of these covariates on the weekly reproduction number are depicted in Fig 1. As expected,
depletion of susceptibles for each strain was negatively correlated with transmissibility of that
strain. Depletion of susceptibles for each strain was also negatively correlated with the
reproduction number of the other betacoronavirus strain, providing evidence of cross-immunity.
Per incidence proxy unit, the effect of the cross-immunizing strain was always less than the
effect of the strain itself (Table S1), but the overall impact of cross-immunity could still be
substantial if the cross-immunizing strain had a large outbreak (e.g. HCoV-OC43 in 2014-15
and 2016-17). Seasonal forcing appears to drive the rise in transmissibility at the start of the
season (late October through early December), while depletion of susceptibles plays a
comparatively larger role in the decline in transmissibility towards the end of the season. The
strain-season coefficients were fairly consistent across seasons for each strain and lacked a
clear correlation with incidence in prior seasons, consistent with experimental results showing
substantial waning of immunity within a year (14).
We integrated these findings into a two-strain ordinary differential equation (ODE)
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model to describe the
transmission dynamics of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (Fig S3). The model provided a good
fit to both the weekly incidence proxies for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 and to the estimated
weekly effective reproduction numbers (Fig 2). According to the best-fit model parameters, the
basic reproduction number for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 varies between 1.4 in the summer
and 2 in the winter, the duration of immunity for both strains is about 40 weeks, and each strain
induces cross-immunity against the other, though the cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 infection
induces against HCoV-HKU1 is stronger than the reverse.
Next, we incorporated a third betacoronavirus into the dynamic transmission model to
represent SARS-CoV-2. We assumed that the incubation period and infectious period for
SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9
days, respectively; see Table S7), in agreement with other estimates (23–25). We allowed the
cross immunities, duration of immunity, degree of seasonal variation in transmissibility, and
establishment time of sustained transmission to vary. For a representative set of parameter
values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence proxy due to SARS-CoV-2
(Table 1, Tables S2-3) and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size (Tables S4-6) for the
five years following the simulated time of establishment. We summarized the post-pandemic
SARS-CoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic
outbreaks, or virtual elimination. Overall, shorter durations of immunity and smaller degrees of
cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses were associated with greater total incidence of

infection due to SARS-CoV-2, and autumn establishments and smaller seasonal fluctuations in
transmissibility were associated with larger pandemic peak sizes. Model simulations
demonstrated the following few key points:
i) SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year. In all modeled scenarios, SARS-CoV2 was capable of producing a substantial outbreak regardless of establishment time.
Winter/spring establishments favored longer-lasting outbreaks with shorter peaks (Fig 3A),
while autumn/winter establishments led to more acute outbreaks (Fig 3B). The five-year
cumulative incidence proxies were comparable for all establishment times (Table 1).
ii) If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent, it will likely enter into regular circulation.
Much like pandemic influenza, many scenarios lead to SARS-CoV-2 entering into long-term
circulation alongside the other human betacoronaviruses (e.g. Fig 3A–B), possibly in annual,
biennial, or sporadic patterns over the next five years (Table 1). Short-term immunity (on the
order of 40 weeks, similar to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) favors the establishment of annual
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, while longer-term immunity (two years) favors biennial outbreaks if
establishment occurs in the winter or spring and sporadic outbreaks if establishment occurs in
the summer or autumn.
iii) If immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is permanent, the virus could disappear for five or more
years after causing a major outbreak. Long-term immunity consistently led to effective
elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and lower overall incidence of infection. If SARS-CoV-2 induces
cross immunity against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, the incidence of all betacoronaviruses
could decline and even virtually disappear (Fig 3C). The virtual elimination of HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1 would be possible if SARS-CoV-2 induced 70% cross immunity against them,
which is the same estimated level of cross-immunity that HCoV-OC43 induces against HCoVHKU1.
iv) Low levels of cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses against SARS-CoV-2
could make SARS-CoV-2 appear to die out, only to resurge after a few years. Even if SARSCoV-2 immunity only lasts for two years, mild (30%) cross-immunity from HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1 could effectively eliminate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for up to three years
before a resurgence in 2025, as long as SARS-CoV-2 does not fully die out (Fig 3D).
v) The dynamics of coronavirus outbreaks in temperate regions over the next five years
may depend heavily on the timing of SARS-CoV-2 establishment. Under certain scenarios,
altering just the timing of SARS-CoV-2 establishment made the difference between annual
short-peaked outbreaks and more sporadic acute outbreaks in the post-pandemic period (Fig

3E–F). The establishment of sustained transmission can be delayed by rapidly detecting and
isolating introduced cases (1).
Our observations are consistent with other predictions of how the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
might unfold. According to a study of geographic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 basic
reproduction number across China, seasonal variations in absolute humidity will be insufficient
to prevent the widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (26). A modelling study using data from
Sweden also found that seasonal establishment of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely in the
post-pandemic period (10).
Our study was subject to a variety of limitations. Only five seasons of observational data
on coronaviruses were available, though the incidence patterns resemble those from 10 years
of data from a hospital in Sweden (10). We assumed that the spline coefficients were constant
across all seasons though seasonal forcing likely differed from year to year based on underlying
drivers. To keep the transmission model from becoming unreasonably complex, we assumed
that there was no difference in the seasonal forcing, per-case force of infection, incubation
period, or infectious period across betacoronaviruses. However, our estimates for these values
lie within the ranges of estimates from the literature, so we do not anticipate that this detracted
from our results. We also did not directly model any effect from the opening of schools, which
could lead to an additional boost in transmission strength in the early autumn (27), or any
effects of behavior change or control efforts, which could suppress the effective reproduction
number. The transmission model is deterministic, so it cannot capture the possibility of SARSCoV-2 extinction.
Accurately quantifying the probability of SARS-CoV-2 extinction would depend on many
factors for which sufficient evidence is currently lacking. We have used percent test-positive
multiplied by percent ILI to approximate coronavirus incidence up to a proportional constant;
results were similar when using the raw number of positive tests and the raw percent positive as
incidence proxies, see Figure S1. While the percent test-positive multiplied by percent ILI has
been shown to be one of the best available proxies for influenza incidence (18), the conversion
between this measure and true incidence of coronavirus infections is unclear, and so we do not
make precise estimates of the overall coronavirus incidence. This conversion will undoubtedly
depend on the particular population for which these estimates are being made. Recent evidence
from New York suggests that some 4% of coronavirus cases seek medical care, and only a
fraction of these are tested (28). In addition, the method that we adopted to estimate the
effective reproduction number depends on the serial interval distribution, which has not been
well-studied for commonly circulating human coronaviruses; we used the best-available

evidence from SARS, the most closely related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings only
generalize to temperate regions, comprising 60% of the world’s population (29), and differences
between average interpersonal contact rates between countries could further modulate the size
and intensity of outbreaks. The transmission dynamics of respiratory illnesses in tropical regions
can be much more complex. However, we expect that if post-pandemic transmission of SARSCoV-2 does take hold in temperate regions, there will also be continued transmission in tropical
regions seeded by the seasonal outbreaks to the north and south. With such reseeding, longterm disappearance of any strain becomes less likely (30), but according to our model the
effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 remains below 1 during most of each period
when that strain disappears, meaning that reseeding would shorten these disappearances only
modestly.
Our findings indicate key pieces of information that are still required to know how the
current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will unfold. Most crucially, longitudinal serological studies from
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could indicate whether or not immunity wanes, and at what
rate. According to our projections, this rate is the key modulator of the total SARS-CoV-2
incidence in the coming years. While long-lasting immunity would lead to lower overall incidence
of infection, it would also complicate vaccine efficacy trials by contributing to low case numbers
when those trials are conducted, as occurred with Zika virus (31). Furthermore, our findings
underscore the need to maintain SARS-CoV-2 surveillance even if the outbreak appears to die
out after the first pandemic wave, as a resurgence in infection could be possible as late as
2025.
In summary, the total incidence of COVID-19 illness over the next five years will depend
critically upon whether or not it enters into regular circulation after the initial pandemic wave,
which in turn depends primarily upon the duration of immunity that SARS-CoV-2 infection
imparts. The intensity and timing of pandemic and post-pandemic outbreaks will depend on the
time of year when widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes established and, to a lesser
degree, upon the magnitude of seasonal variation in transmissibility and the level of crossimmunity that exists between the betacoronaviruses. Longitudinal serological studies are
urgently required to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and epidemiological
surveillance should be maintained in the coming years to anticipate the possibility of
resurgence.

Supplement.
Materials and Methods
Data. Viral testing data came from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Virus
Surveillance System (NREVSS) (17). We extracted the weekly number of total tests for any
coronavirus and positive tests for betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 from all
reporting laboratories between 5th July 2014 and 29th June 2019. Dividing the weekly number of
positive tests by the total weekly number of tests yielded the weekly percentage of positive tests
for each coronavirus.
To estimate the incidence of each betacoronavirus, we used an incidence proxy
calculated by multiplying the weekly percentage of positive tests for each coronavirus by the
weekly population-weighted proportion of physician visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) (13).
The assumptions needed for this proxy to capture true influenza incidence up to a multiplicative
constant are described in Goldstein et al. (2011) (18). Since betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43
and HCoV-HKU1 are more likely to cause milder cold-like symptoms or acute respiratory
infection than ILI, our proxy additionally requires that the proportion of coronavirus cases with ILI
is constant over the study period. The weekly proportions of ILI visits were obtained from the US
Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) and accessed through the
FluView Interactive website (19).
Estimating the impact of cross immunity and seasonal drivers of transmission. We used
the effective reproduction number, defined as the average number of secondary infections
caused by a single infected individual, to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of each
coronavirus strain. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Ru) based on case
counts and the generation interval distribution (20), with the following parameterization (21):

where b(t) is the strain-level incidence proxy on day t, and g(a) is the value of the generation
interval distribution at time a. To translate the weekly incidence proxies to measures of daily
incidence, we followed a previously described spline-based procedure (22). For smoothing, the
final weekly R is the geometric mean of the daily values in the preceding, current, and following
weeks (moving 3-week average). We discarded the first three and last three weekly R
estimates. To avoid unstable R estimates resulting from periods of low coronavirus activity, we
limited our analysis to “in-season” estimates. Seasons were defined as epidemiological week 40
of each year through week 20 of the following year (roughly October through May). Because
2014 consisted of 53 weeks, we truncated the 2014-15 season at week 19 of 2015.
The generation interval for the four commonly circulating coronaviruses has not been
well-studied. In this analysis, we used the estimated serial interval distribution for SARS
(Weibull with mean 8.4 days and standard deviation 3.8 days (32)) and varied this assumption
in sensitivity analyses based on observations that the serial interval for currently circulating
human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 may be considerably lower (33). We assumed that the
maximum generation interval was the first day at which over 99% of the density had been
captured.
To understand the relative contribution of depletion of susceptibles compared to
seasonal forcing in the observed data, we adapted a linear regression model as follows (22):

where Rsij is the weekly effective reproduction number for strain s in week i of season j, R0 is the
basic reproduction number, S0 is the fraction of susceptibles at the start of the first season for
the reference strain, and ϵsij is a normally distributed error term. A dummy variable for each
strain-season combination (ɑsj) captures differences in the reproduction number and the starting
fraction of susceptibles between strains and over time, but is unable to distinguish between the
two. The next two terms estimate the impact of depletion of susceptibles due to infection by the
same strain (dsij) and the other betacoronavirus strain (drij). Depletion of susceptibles for each
strain was estimated up to a proportionality constant by the cumulative sum of the incidence
proxy over season j through week i. The coefficient on the first term (γs) represents the scaling
factor between the cumulative incidence proxy and true depletion of susceptibles, while δs
captures the level of cross-immunity in addition to scaling; both coefficients were allowed to vary
by strain. Because specific seasonal drivers (e.g. absolute humidity) of seasonal variation in
coronavirus transmission have not been identified, we did not include them in our model but

used a cubic basis spline with knots every four weeks to capture fluctuations in seasonal forcing
over the year. Bn represents the ten basis functions for a cubic spline with seven internal knots
and no intercept, and βn the coefficients corresponding to each of these functions.
Dynamic transmission model. We implemented a two-strain ordinary differential equation (ODE)
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model to describe the
transmission dynamics of HCoV-OC43 (‘strain 1’) and HCoV-HKU1 (‘strain 2’) in the United
States. Exposed individuals became infectious at rate ν and infectious individuals recovered at
rate γ. Immunity waned at rates σ1 and σ2 for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, respectively. The
basic reproduction number, R0, was assumed to be seasonal with a period of 52 weeks,
specified by the equation

where a is the amplitude of the seasonal forcing term, b is the minimum value, and Φ is the
phase shift in weeks. The transmission rate β(t) is related to the basic reproduction number by
the formula (11)

Cross immunity of HCoV-OC43 against HCoV-HKU1 was captured by χ1,2 such that the
transmission rate of HCoV-HKU1 to an individual who is exposed to, infected with, or recovered
from HCoV-OC43 was reduced by a factor of 1-χ1,2, and vice-versa. Individuals died at rate μ
such that the average lifespan was 1/μ = 80 years. Fully-susceptible individuals were born at the
same rate μ to keep the population size constant. A schematic of the model structure is depicted
in Fig S3.
The entire population was assumed to be susceptible at the start of the simulation period
(time = 0). Infection was introduced through a brief, small pulse in the force of infection (an
increase of 0.01/week for one half week) for each strain within the first year of the simulation,
simulating the establishment of sustained person-to-person transmission. The model was run
for 24.5 years to allow the dynamics to reach a steady state, and then the simulated incidence
of Strain 1 and Strain 2 were compared with the percent test-positives multiplied by percent of
clinic visits for ILI for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, respectively. Model fit was assessed by log
likelihood. To determine the parameter values consistent with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1
transmission, we used latin hypercube sampling (LHS) (34) to simulate transmission for 100,000
combinations of the model parameters sampled uniformly from the ranges reported in Table 1.

We then used a hill-climbing algorithm to identify the maximum likelihood parameter values,
using the best-fit parameter combination from the LHS scheme as initial conditions. The model
was implemented in R version 3.6.1 (35) and solved using the lsoda() function (36). We further
validated the model by visually comparing its estimates of the effective reproduction number for
each strain against the regression-based estimates described above. The model-based
effective reproduction number was calculated as the product of the basic reproduction number
and the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population at time t, accounting for crossimmunity (37).
Next, we incorporated a third strain into the dynamic transmission model to represent
SARS-CoV-2. Using the maximum likelihood parameter values, we simulated transmission of
HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 for 20 years and then simulated the establishment of sustained
SARS-CoV-2 transmission using another half-week pulse in the force of infection. We assumed
that the incubation period and infectious period for SARS-CoV-2 were the same as the best-fit
values for the other betacoronaviruses (5.0 and 4.9 days, respectively; see Table S7), in broad
agreement with other estimates (23–25). We allowed the cross immunities, duration of
immunity, degree of seasonal variation in R0, and establishment time of SARS-CoV-2 to vary. In
particular, we allowed the cross immunity from SARS-CoV-2 to the other betacoronaviruses to
range from 0 to 1, the cross immunity from the other betacoronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 to
range from 0 to 0.5 (following the observation that SARS infection can induce long-lasting
neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-OC43 but not vice-versa (15)),the duration of immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 to range from 40 weeks to permanent, the seasonal variation in R0 to vary
between none and equivalent to the other human betacoronaviruses, and the establishment
time to vary throughout 2020. To adjust the amount of seasonal variation in R0, we held the
maximum wintertime value of the sinusoid fixed and adjusted the minimum summertime
(baseline) value. This way, smaller degrees of seasonal forcing translated into smaller
summertime declines in R0; for the no-seasonality scenario, R0 was therefore held fixed at its
maximal wintertime value. This choice was informed by observations on the seasonal variation
in R0 for influenza, for which the wintertime R0 was similar between geographic locations with
distinct climates, while the summertime R0 varied substantially between locations (11). For a
representative set of parameter values within these ranges, we measured the annual incidence
of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 and the annual SARS-CoV-2 outbreak peak size for the five
years following the simulated time of establishment. We summarized the post-pandemic SARSCoV-2 dynamics into the categories of annual outbreaks, biennial outbreaks, sporadic
outbreaks, or virtual elimination.

other betacoronaviruses. Chi3X represents the degree of cross-immunity induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2
against OC43 and HKU1 and ChiX3 represents the degree of cross-immunity induced by OC43 or HKU1 infection
against SARS-CoV-2. The establishment times correspond to: Winter - week 4 (early February); Spring - week 16
(late April); Summer - week 28 (mid July); Autumn - week 40 (early October). Darker shading corresponds to higher
peak sizes.

Table S6. Peak simulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemic sizes, in units of percent influenza-like illness (ILI) x percent
positive laboratory tests, by year for a representative set of cross immunities, immunity durations, and establishment
times. Percent ILI is measured as the population-weighted proportion of visits to sentinel providers that were
associated with influenza symptoms. The seasonality factor represents the amount of seasonal variation in the
SARS-CoV-2 R0 relative to the other human betacoronaviruses. A seasonality factor of 0 indicates no seasonal
variation in R0 for SARS-CoV-2. Chi3X represents the degree of cross-immunity induced by infection with SARSCoV-2 against OC43 and HKU1 and ChiX3 represents the degree of cross-immunity induced by OC43 or HKU1
infection against SARS-CoV-2. The establishment times correspond to: Winter - week 4 (early February); Spring week 16 (late April); Summer - week 28 (mid July); Autumn - week 40 (early October). Darker shading corresponds to
higher peak sizes.

Figure S2. Estimates of weekly effective reproduction numbers for HCoV-HKU1 (top) and HCoV-OC43 (bottom)
based on different serial interval distributions. Serial interval distributions were defined as follows - SARS (solid):
Weibull distribution with mean of 8.4 days and s.d. of 3.8 days (shape=2.35, scale=9.48); Li2020 (dashed): Gamma
distribution with mean of 7.5 days and s.d. of 3.4 days (shape=4.87, scale=1.54); Nishiura2020 (dotted): Weibull
distribution with mean of 4.8 days and s.d. of 2.3 days (shape=2.20, scale=5.42). Sections shaded in gray are out-ofseason (epidemiological weeks 21-39). R effective estimates for HCoV-HKU1 that were greater than 3 (all occurring
at the end of 2014) are not shown.

Figure S3. Diagram of the two-strain compartmental SEIR model used to describe the transmission of HCoV-OC43
and HCoV-HKU1 in the United States. Epidemiological compartments are represented by the bold letter-number
pairs, such that an individual in compartment S1S2 is susceptible to both strains, while a person in compartment I1E2
is infectious with strain 1 and has been exposed to strain 2. Filled circles represent death and the open circle
represents births. Transition rates are given next to the arrows between compartments. Best-fit parameter values are
listed in Table S7.
