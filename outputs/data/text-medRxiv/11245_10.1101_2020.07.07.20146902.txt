Abstract

9

Background: This study was aimed to investigate the application of SARS- COV-2

10

IgM and IgG antibodies in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.

11

Method: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from

12

January to February, 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-COV-2 infected

13

confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. 9 patients were in the

14

suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101

15

patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-COV-2

16

infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies

17

were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients.

18

Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were

19

99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24%

20

(60/68) and 97.06% (66/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of

21

SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67/68).

Introduction

29

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus responsible for an outbreak of

30

respiratory illness known as COVID-19, and now it is a global pandemic in more than

31

215 countries [1]. The current standard diagnostic method for diagnosis of COVID-19

32

is to detect the virus nucleic acid RT-PCR [2]. However, real-time PCR detection had

33

some limitations, e.g. time-consuming, complicated operation with specialized

34

equipment, need special detection sites, which limit its application during COVID-19

35

outbreak [3].Therefore, a simple, sensitive and accurate test was needed to identify

36

SARS-COV-2 infected patients in a COVID-19 outbreak area urgently.

37

Based on the diagnosis experience of many clinical cases, the detection of novel

38

coronavirus antibody can be used as an auxiliary diagnosis of novel coronavirus

39

pneumonia [4,5]. After SARS-COV-2 infection, the body's immune system can create

40

immune response to fight against the virus and produce specific antibodies. In general

41

virology, the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, produced in the early period after

42

the infection, can indicate the current infection or the recent infection.

43

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is also an important antibody produced by the

44

immune system, indicating that the disease is in the middle to late stage, or presence

45

of past infection. Therefore, the combined detection of IgM and IgG can be used not

46

only in the early diagnosis of infectious diseases, but also in the assessment of the

47

stage of infection.

48

Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) has been developed as an effective

49

combination of immunoassay and chemiluminescence system [6] and it has been used

50

recently in SARS-COV-2 diagnosis. In this study, we used a CLIA test product, which

51

can detect IgM and IgG in human serum within 30 minutes. Our aim is to investigate

52

the clinical value of CLIA for the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection. This CLIA

53

method demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in our study, which can be used

54

not only in hospitals and accredited laboratories, but also can be used in airports,

55

border ports, seaports, and train stations etc. This CLIA method has potential to be a

56

powerful weapon against the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study enrolled a total of 178 patients who visited Huangshi Central Hospital in

60

Hubei Province, China, between January and February 2020. The patients included 91

61

males (51.1%) and 87 females (48.9%) with a mean age of 54.3 years (ranging from 2

62

months to 94 years). Among them, SARS-COV-2 group had 68 patients, 36 males and

63

32 females (ranging from 30 years to 90 years); suspected group had 9 patients, 7

64

males and 2 females (ranging from 2 months to 64 years); negative group had 101

65

patients, 48 males and 53 females (ranging from 2 years to 94 years). This study is in

66

compliance of ICC clinical trial specifications and the Helsinki Declaration.

67

Serologic tests

68

Serum was collected from all patients. Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were tested

69

by CLIA kits and iFlash 3000 fully automated CLIA analyzer from Shenzhen YHLO

70

Biotech Co., Ltd (China). Briefly, serum was separated by centrifugation at 2500g for

71

5 min within 12 hours of collection. The magnetic beads of these CLIA assays are

72

coated with two antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (Nucleocapsid protein and N protein, Spike

73

protein and S protein). SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG titers (in arbitrary units, AU/ml) were

74

calculated automatically by the CLIA analyzer based on relative light units (RLU),

75

and the viral antibody titer is positively associated with RLU. The cut-off values for

76

positive SARSCoV-2 IgM and IgG are both 10 AU/ml.

77

SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid test

78

RT-PCR was used to detect open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid

79

protein (N) in the SARS-COV-2 genome. CT value interpretation of test results is

80

based on instruction of use from manufacturer. Confirmation of positive COVID-19 is

81

based on at least one target-specific RT-PCR positive result of ORF1ab and N genes

82

of SARS-COV-2 in the same specimen.

83

Data analysis

84

The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 statistical software (IBM

SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The kappa coefficient was calculated. Kappa ≥ 0.75

86

indicates good consistency, 0.75≥ kappa >0.4 for medium consistency, and kappa

87

<0.4 for poor consistency.

88

The specificity and sensitivity of the CLIA test kits were calculated according to the

89

following equations:

90

Sensitivity (%) = 100 x [True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)];

91

Specificity (%) = 100 x [True negative / (True Negative + False Positive)].

The specificity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody test

94

Samples from both NAT negative patients (suspect group, 9 subjects) and other

95

diseases population (control group, 101 subjects) were used to assess the clinical

96

specificity of the assay (Table 1). Among the 101 patients in the control group, 100

97

patients were negative for SARS-COV-2 IgM antibody, with a clinical specificity of

98

99.01% (100/101). 97 patients were negative for SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody, with a

99

clinical specificity was 96.04% (97/101). In the suspect group, all 9 patients had

100

negative antibody test results. The false positive results of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG

101

antibodies may be caused by autoantibodies, heterophilic antibodies and other factors.

Discussion

126

Novel Coronavrius is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

127

(SARS-CoV-2) [7]. SARS-COV-2 belongs to the subfamily of Coronavirinae (named

128

Betacoronavirus), and its genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA [8].

129

Different from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-COV-2 is the seventh member of

130

the family of coronaviruses that infect humans [9]. The disease (COVID-19) is

131

spreading rapidly within five months, and now it has been found in more than 215

132

countries. By June 19th, 2020, over 8, 300, 000 COVID-19 confirmed patients were

133

reported, with>450, 000 deaths. Currently, the SARS-COV-2 NAT is the routine

134

confirmation test for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 [2]. However, not all clinical

135

COVID-19 patients might have positive result from SARS-COV-2 NAT. The reasons

136

of false negative NAT results in COVID-19 include collection and storage of the

137

sample, the condition of NAT test laboratory and the quality of the test kit [10].

138

Therefore, nucleic acid detection, CT imaging, blood routine examination and other

139

methods can be used together for the comprehensive diagnosis of COVID-19.

140

Since February 2020, several SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibody immunoassay kits

141

have been developed in China. Antibody detection is a new detection method for

142

SARS-COV-2, so the clinical specificity and clinical sensitivity of such tests must be

143

carefully validated [11]. Our study demonstrated that the SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG
8

144

CLIA kits (YHLO Biotech, Shenzhen, China) had a high clinical specificity, reaching

145

99.01% and 96.04% respectively. Therefore, SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibody

146

detection reagents have high clinical specificity and can meet the screening and

147

diagnosis requirements of SARS-COV-2.

148

In COVID-19 cases, the clinical sensitivity of SARS-COV-2 IgM detection was

149

88.23%, while the clinical sensitivity of SARS-COV-2 IgG detection was 97.06%.

150

CLIA system can simultaneously detect 150-300 clinical samples, which is a good

151

tool for screening and diagnosis of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia infected by

152

SARS-COV-2. Our study results showed that the combined detection of

153

SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies is an effective tool to improve the diagnostic

154

sensitivity and specificity and reduce the chance of false negative NAT results. We

155

demonstrate that the antibody detection can be used as one of the effective methods of

156

COVID-19 clinical detection.

157

In NAT confirmed group, serum from 68 COVID-19 cases were tested by

158

SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies can be detected in 75.00%

159

of patients before 7 days since onset of the symptoms, and the positive rate reached to

160

the 88.00% on the period of 7-14 days, and then increased to 93.55% after 14 days.

161

The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 83.33% before 7 days since onset of

162

symptoms, and reached to 100.00% on 7-14 days and remained 100% after 14 days.

163

In general, the immune response to infection by pathogenic microorganisms is first

164

expressed as an increase in IgM antibody titer and then a rapid decrease until it

165

disappears. While the IgG antibody titer normally increased in the middle and late

166

stages of the infection, and it can be positive for a long time even after recovery.

167

According to the results of this study, the positive rate of IgM in SARS-COV-2

168

infected patients is lower than IgG, because most of the infected patients were in the

169

middle stage of infection or in the recovery stage. Interestingly, we have observed a

170

phenomenon that SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies developed almost

171

simultaneously and this observation is consistent with some recent studies [12].

172

Further studies are needed to verify this phenomenon in the diagnosis and prognosis

173

of COVID-19.

174

We found false negative results for IgM / IgG in the NAT group. There might be three

175

reasons: First of all, false negative results may be due to low antibody titer. When IgM

176

and IgG titer is below the detection limit, the test result might be negative. Secondly,

177

the difference in individual immune response and antibody production could be

178

another reason for the false negative results in COVID-19 patients. The last reason

179

might be that IgM antibody might decrease or even, disappear after 15 days. In each

180

individual case, it is difficult to know exactly when or how long the patient has been

181

really infected, and someone might have IgM titer below detection limit and not

182

detectable. In the joint detection of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG, there was only one

183

negative patients (male, 77 years old) who had respiratory failure, chronic obstructive

184

pulmonary disease, coronary atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure

185

with SARS-COV-2 infection. In the control group, 5 cases were positive for antibody

186

detection (1 case for IgM, 4 cases for IgG). The results suggested that the patients

187

who had some other diseases, including tumors, leukemia, diabetes, hypertension,

188

coronary atherosclerosis, bronchitis or lung infections might be more susceptible to

189

infected by SARS-COV-2 and led to a positive antibody detection. Also, there might

190

be false negative nucleic acids, or recovered/ mild / asymptomatic patients with

191

SARS-COV-2. All of these cases will provide valuable reference for the follow-up

192

study and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

193

Our study also has some limitations. For example, we didn’t investigate the

194

cross-reaction with other pathogens (e.g., hCoV-NL-63 or others), MERS-COV,

195

SARS-COV and some auto-antibodies that could cause interference for immunoassay.

196

We also didn’t perform dynamic monitoring of the change of antibodies titer for

197

in-depth study.

198

Conclusions

199

Overall, testing SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM by CLIA method is convenient for

200

sampling, and it has high efficiency. The results of this study indicated that combined

201

detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 had better sensitivity and

202

specificity compared with single IgM or IgG test. Therefore, the serological test

203

results can be used as an effective diagnostic tool for SARS-COV-2 infection. It also

204

can be used as an efficient supplement of RNA detection for confirmation of

205

SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinics, hospitals and accredited scientific laboratory.
