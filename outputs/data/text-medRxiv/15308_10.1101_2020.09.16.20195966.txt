Abstract
Aim: To systematically review qualitative literature on social distancing in order to
identify and describe factors that enable or prevent its implementation.
Methods: A rapid systematic qualitative review was conducted for which a
comprehensive systematic search was carried out across eleven databases.
Included papers report on primary qualitative studies of the barriers and facilitators to
the implementation of social distancing measures in potentially epidemic infectious
diseases. An adapted meta-ethnographical approach was used for synthesis.
Review findings were assessed for strength and reliability using GRADE-CERQual.
Results: 29 papers were included from the systematic search that yielded 5620
results and supplementary methods. The review identifies two broad categories of
barriers to social distancing measures: individual- or community-level psychological
or sociological phenomena, and perceived shortcomings in governmental action.
Based on this, 25 themes are identified that can be addressed to improve the
implementation of social distancing.
Conclusion: There are many barriers, on different levels, to the implementation of
social distancing measures. Among other findings, the review identifies the need for
good communication as well as the need for authorities to provide comprehensive
support as two key opportunities to increase acceptability and adherence. Highquality research is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic to better describe
mechanisms by which implementation of social distancing can be improved, and,
more importantly, what is already known has to be put into practice.

Social distancing: barriers to its implementation and how
they can be overcome – a rapid systematic review
Introduction
On 31 December 2019, the WHO was informed of an outbreak of pneumonia of
unknown aetiology in the city of Wuhan, China (1). This was the starting point of a
pandemic affecting millions of people. In the following weeks and months, as SARSCoV-2 started to spread to an increasing number of countries, social distancing was
rapidly established as a central part of containment efforts (2).
Social distancing measures are not new. They have been employed and
researched previously, specifically during epidemics of diseases like SARS, MERS
or pandemic forms of influenza (2–4). The modelling and observational studies that
have been conducted suggest the important effect such measures can have, and
with a lack of therapeutic options, decisive preventive action is necessary to be able
to save lives (5–8).
In spite of some research around social distancing measures in the context of
non-pharmaceutical interventions (4), it remains unclear what factors enable or
prevent their implementation, and what determines their feasibility and acceptability
in the eyes of the public that is expected to carry them out. This is a critical question
because many of these measures depend on the participation of the whole
population. Having a stronger understanding of what factors prevent or promote the
implementation of and adherence to social distancing measures is crucial for
designing an effective and ethical pandemic response.
To be able to provide guidance for policymaking and future research, this
systematic qualitative review sets out to synthesise the evidence relating to factors
that affect the implementation of social distancing measures.

Methods
A rapid systematic review of qualitative research on social distancing was
conducted. A protocol was outlined internally before the start of the review process.
In order to ensure reflexivity in the conduct of this review, the lead reviewers

considered, at the outset and throughout the review process, how their views and
opinions were likely shaped by their first-hand experiences of social distancing
implementation in Germany and the UK.
Inclusion Criteria
Studies were included in this review if they:
(a) reported on qualitative studies with primary data generation
(b) addressed infectious diseases with human-to-human transmission and
epidemic potential (Influenza, MERS, SARS, Ebola), and
(c) included information on feasibility, acceptability, barriers, facilitators and
attitudes regarding the implementation of social distancing measures.
Search Strategy
The primary, defining search for “Social Distancing”
Despite the central role social distancing plays in the pandemic response, neither
researchers nor policymakers or the media use consistent definitions. In order to
build a search strategy that is sensitive to all measures that fall within the broad
concept of social distancing, a primary, defining search was performed in MEDLINE,
EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases for
the search term “Social Distancing”. Additionally, websites and documents of the
WHO (9,10), CDC (11,12), ECDC, China CDC and Africa CDC (13) were searched
for definitions of social distancing. Searches were carried out on 13 March 2020.
The identified concepts for measures were policy-level interventions like
mandated closure of schools, child-care facilities, restaurants, and public venues, the
cancellation of public events, bans on public transportation as well as isolation and
quarantine on the one hand, and individual-level behavioural responses, like
workplace non-attendance, contact number reduction, staying home, avoiding
crowds, avoiding transportation and reducing travel on the other hand.
The final search for qualitative studies on the acceptability, feasibility and
implementation of social distancing measures was based on these findings and
definitions.

The final search
Based on the results of this primary investigation, a second search was performed
that included all aspects of social distancing that were found through the first search.
The general strategy was to combine terms related to social distancing with terms on
mass gatherings, and to then combine those with terms around epidemics. In the
end, a qualitative filter (developed by UThealth,
https://libguides.sph.uth.tmc.edu/search_filters) was applied to the results. The full
search strategy can be found in appendix 1. This final search was carried out
between 17 and 19 March 2020 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health,
CINAHL, SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI, CPI-S, CPI-SSH, and ESCI. The most
recent version of each database was used, and no time restrictions were applied.
Study Selection
All the records retrieved were imported into Zotero 5.0
(https://www.zotero.org/download/) from which duplicates were removed and titles
and abstracts were screened against the inclusion criteria. The selection of studies
was discussed among the authors, and consensus was reached.
Data Extraction
Data were extracted regarding the following aspects: setting, sample size and
composition, data collection methods, study aims as well as first order (participant
quotes) and second order themes (analysis and interpretation by study authors).
This was done using a standardised form which was also used to synthesise third
order meta-synthesis themes, and to track quality assessment.
Quality Assessment
The quality of all included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme (CASP) assessment tool for qualitative studies. (14) The authors
conducted their critical appraisal independently and discussed their assessments to
reach consensus.
Analytic Strategy and Synthesis
The review uses meta-ethnographical approaches adapted from Britten and
colleagues (15).

Each paper was studied in-depth and themes that relate to the research question
were identified inductively from the data. Line-by-line coding was done for relevant
segments of reports. Participant statements quoted in research reports were treated
as first order themes, and the analysis and interpretation by researchers were
treated as second order themes. The third order meta-synthetical themes were
formed inductively based on these previously identified themes following initial in
vivo and subsequent axial coding. Differences between reviewers’ assessments
were discussed until consensus was reached. The third-order themes were treated
as the review’s findings. Confidence in each finding was assessed using the
GRADE-CERQual approach, which considers methodological limitations, relevance,
coherence, and adequacy of data (16). The quality assessment previously performed
using CASP contributed to the weighing of study findings by informing the appraisal
of the GRADE-CERQual “methodological limitations” category. Moreover, where
themes were corroborated by multiple studies of which at least one was high-quality
(defined has having no significant concerns regarding study design, recruitment,
data collection and analysis, i.e. rated with “Yes”), overall minor quality concerns
were reduced, and a high confidence rating was attributed for that finding.
MS analysed all included studies and KM double-coded a third of the included
studies. The authors reached consensus regarding identified themes and review
findings.
Reporting
This review follows PRISMA (17) and ENTREQ (18) statement guidelines.

Results
Description of search results and included studies
The final search (see figure 1) yielded 5620 results. After deduplication, 4019 titles
and abstracts were screened. 147 papers which could not be excluded based on title
and abstract remained for full text screening of which 28 papers were included. One
additional paper was identified by searching references of studies.
Of the included studies, 8 included data from African countries (3 from Sierra
Leone, 3 from Liberia, 1 from Ghana, and 1 from Senegal), 10 included data from
North America (6 from Canada and 4 from USA), 5 were conducted in Australia, 2

were conducted in the UK, and one further study included data from the UK and
Australia combined. Most papers (22/29) addressed general issues around social
distancing or dealt with multiple explicit measures, among which quarantine was the
most dominant one, 3/29 papers exclusively addressed quarantine and 4/29 papers
focused on school closures or school-based social distancing while also addressing
general concerns. A total of 2199 participants were interviewed or participated in
focus group discussions (FGDs), with one study not explicitly reporting the number of
participants. Table 1 shows a full list of included studies with information on key
characteristics. With regards to study quality, we found that generally, few papers
report the reasoning behind data collection and analytical methods used. Only 3 out
of 29 reports included indications of reflexivity. In spite of flaws in reporting, all
studies provided valuable insights, and appeared to have been conducted
appropriately. None of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were excluded
based on poor quality. Instead, quality issues were considered when evaluating
confidence in review findings using GRADE-CERQual.

Barriers to the implementation of social distancing measures
Barriers and facilitators identified in the included studies can broadly be categorised
into two main types. A full list of concepts with examples of first and second order
themes is provided in supplementary table 1.
Psychological, psychosocial and sociological influences
The first category of barriers comprises individual- and community-level factors.
Study participants frequently reported a lack of trust in government and authorities
as an important barrier to adherence. (22,24,25,31,34) As a focus group participant
in one of the studies described,
“With the government, we already know, they’re going to know and they’re not
going to let us know until a week or two later…”. (Baum 2009)
Apart from not trusting authorities, for community members, the fear of being
stigmatised by their peers as a result of contracting a disease or being in contact
with a suspected case was perceived to be a strong barrier to social distancing
(21,26,31,32,39,41), as expressed by the following quote from a study in Senegal:
“I haven't worked because during this whole time, they looked at you a certain
way because they all knew that I was among those who were held, so it's not
been easy, you know…” (Desclaux 2017)
In addition to the fear of stigma, the psychological stress induced by uncertainty and
measures like quarantine (23,26,31–33,42) was frequently described as a major
barrier.
“I thought of that movie (Ben Hur) all the time while I was in quarantine
because I remember the part of him going and looking for his sister and his
mother, where they had that … sickness, leprosy. And they could not be with

the rest of the people... and that’s how I felt. I was separate from the world.”
(Cava 2005)
Study participants further considered people’s lack of knowledge and
misconceptions about the disease (21,25,27,37,46), inconsistencies between
personal experience and information received (19,25,27,45), a perceived lack of
threat, and the perceived lack of value of interventions (22,27,31,40,44,46) to be
barriers to social distancing adherence:
“I would have to weigh the amount of risk vs. the potential for panic and for
there to be a backlash against the kinds of rules that are being instituted. …
there’s a balance between over-reacting and under-reacting to a situation ...”
(Smith 2012)
Many study participants described a perceived lack of community collaboration (22–
24,27,28,31,32,34,40) as an important barrier:
"But then I would think if I was to do this, the next, the next person isn't, why
should I blow out the stops" (Morrison Yardley 2009)
Feelings of solidarity on the other hand were described as crucial to overcome this
barrier:
“We’re all trying to be good citizens. And we’re all trying to help, you know,
other people by making sacrifices like being in quarantine.” (Cava 2005)
Further influences that could become barriers were the inability to work and
resulting financial hardship (23,26), dependence on social networks and support
systems (22,23,41), social-cultural norms and perceived gender roles (20,25) as well
as practical reasons like wanting or having to care for others (40,46).
Perceived shortcomings in governmental and authority action
With regards to governmental and authority action, study participants lamented the
lack of community involvement. (22,24,30,33,41,43,45)
“Listen to the average citizens. If there are task forces, citizens should be on
each task force.” (Baum 2009)
They further criticised the insufficiency of emotional, financial or material support and
cited this as a key reason for non-adherence. (22,23,25,26,31,32,34,38,41,42,45,47)

“We had no food at the start. They should have given us food like they did in
other households at the end.” (Caleo 2018)
Poor communication was identified as one of the most important factors affecting
implementation and adherence to measurements. This included a lack of guidance
and ambiguous messaging (19,22,24,26,31,47), as demonstrated by the following
quote from a study participant:
“I sometimes felt as if I was getting mixed messages. And even the ladies who
called from Public Health . . . one I believe said when you’re by yourself you
didn’t need the mask. But then the other one said, well no, you have to keep it
on all the time.” (Cava 2005)
Further aspects of poor communication cited by study participants were unsuitable
messages (19,24,26,35–38), a lack of credibility (24,27,34,39) as well the
inadequacy of timing (19) and channels of communication (22,29,32,37,45).
Inadequate preparedness (30,32,38), the lack of legislation and penalties
(23,25,27,34,45) and authorities’ failure to take equity into account (24,26,38) were
additional barriers brought up by participants in a range of settings.
How to facilitate implementation of social distancing measures
Based on these barriers, and with due consideration of enablers of social distancing
described in the included studies, the review identified 25 themes that can be
addressed to improve the implementation of social distancing. These themes belong
to one of the two broad categories described above. Additionally, because of the
richness and coherence of data that support them, themes around communication
are listed in a distinct sub-category (see table 2).
Data from the studies included in this review indicate that it is important to
address stigmatisation and the psychological burden of measures like quarantine.
(21,23,26,31–33,39,41) Building trust in government and authorities as well as
promoting confidence in the implemented measures are further opportunities for
improvement (22,24,25,27,31,34,40,44,46). Addressing solidarity, social
responsibility and community collaboration promotes adherence and is a critical
element of the response (22–24,27,28,31,32,34,40).
With regards to actions taken by governments and authorities, the most central
theme that emerged from the analysis of data in this review is the importance of

providing support (emotional, medical, material, and financial) for people who adhere
to social distancing, so that no or few negative consequences stem from adherence
(22,23,25,26,31,32,34,38,41,45,47). Governments and authorities need to include
the community in the planning before and in the response during epidemics
(22,24,30,33,41,43,45). Furthermore, the implementation of legislation and the use
of penalties appear to be an acceptable means of increasing adherence to social
distancing measures (23,25,27,34,45).
Ultimately, the most central theme identified across studies is the critical
importance of good communication (24,26,27,29,30,32–40,45,46). Messages and
messengers should be credible. Many study participants reported a mistrust of the
media and instead asked that scientific experts be at the forefront of communication
with the public. With regards to the dynamics of communication, there is broad
coherence across the included studies regarding the importance of acknowledging
uncertainty and the need for adaptation to changing circumstances. Messages
should be tailored to the diverse communities of recipients (35–38), and information
should be context specific and relevant to people’s lives. Further important aspects
identified were transparency, good timing, clarity and uniformity (19,24,26,35–38).

Alignment of messaging and lived experience: It
should be considered that people’s personal
experience being different from the depiction of the
situation by media and authorities is a barrier to SD
adherence.

2.2 Communication-related factors
Good communication is critical: Messaging and
messengers should be credible, and people call for
experts to be on the forefront of communication with
the public. There is mistrust against the media.
Communication should be transparent, timely, clear
and uniform, and it should acknowledge uncertainty
and the need for adaptation to changing
circumstances.

Providing knowledge and battling misconceptions
about the disease might be valuable ways to
increase adherence to SD measures.

Doctors contributing as trusted messengers:
Doctors, especially family physicians can act as
highly trusted and influential messengers in the
response. They should be a) prepared, e.g. by
having email addresses of their patients etc., and b)
be included during the pandemic as central
conveyors of information.
Direct two-way communication: Direct

health authorities increases effectiveness of SD
implementation.

Discussion
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic qualitative review focussing on
the implementation of social distancing measures. The review identifies a list of 25
factors that can potentially affect implementation of and adherence to social
distancing measures. These factors can broadly be summarised under the themes of
individual- or community-level psychosocial factors on the one hand, and
government or authority factors on the other. While in reality there are likely many
complex relationships between the different factors influencing social distancing
acceptability, the schematic depiction in figure 2 (below) may be a useful conceptual
way to understand what determines people’s willingness to adhere to social
distancing.

Figure 2: Factors influencing the acceptability of and adherence to social distancing measures. “+” indicates moderate
confidence, and “++” indicates high confidence in the factor being an important enabler of social distancing acceptability and
adherence.

Where aspects of social distancing were discussed in previous reviews, especially
with regards to quarantine and isolation, there is broad agreement on the identified
themes, which this review develops further (4,7). Within the studies included in this
review, there is broad agreement on the most central barriers and facilitators (as
indicated in our summary table 2). Even where there was not enough data to make a
high-confidence statement, the review did not find substantial disagreement between
the identified studies.
Implications for policymaking, services, and communication
The review’s findings demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive support
system, transparent policies, and sufficient community involvement. They all can

contribute to adherence to social distancing measures, and present opportunities for
governments to improve the acceptability of mandated measures. The review further
indicates that it is critical for policymakers and service providers to recognise the toll
measures can take on people. The evidence from the review also shows that
preventing stigma, appealing to solidarity, building trust, and making sure that strong
support systems are put in place are important in order to alleviate hardship faced by
the population that is expected to adhere to social distancing. Finally, effective,
transparent, trustworthy communication appears to be a central enabler to the
acceptability of and adherence to social distancing measures. Responsible
communication should be transparent, timely, clear and uniform, and trusted experts
should be at the forefront. Good communication acknowledges uncertainty and the
need to adapt to changing circumstances. The evidence also suggests that
messaging should be context-specific and relevant to people’s lives. All of these
recommendations are concrete and actionable opportunities for policymakers and
service providers as well as anyone who communicates with the public.
Implications for future research
Barriers to and facilitators of social distancing have often been addressed implicitly in
the qualitative studies that were identified in this review. Future qualitative research
should address implementation more directly.
The systematic searches identified a number of quantitative studies that could
complement the review findings in a meaningful way. A mixed methods approach or
a future quantitative review may be of value.
Moving forward, findings from this review can inform not only policy
implementation but also the research design of future studies to evaluate social
distancing measures, their acceptability, feasibility and potential effectiveness.
This review further underlines the importance of terminological specificity.
Limitations of this review
This review has a number of limitations. Firstly, the literature search could have been
complemented by searching specific journals and the grey literature.
Most of the studies included in the review have some methodological
limitations. The review attempted to account for this in the assessment of confidence
for review findings. With regards to whether or not results are broadly representative,

17

included studies were conducted in a limited number of contexts. Geographical
areas of the world that are not represented are large parts of Europe and Asia as
well as Central and South America. This introduces uncertainty since these
measures might be highly settings-dependent.
Importantly, the social distancing scenarios identified in this review are rather
short-term. During the coronavirus pandemic, the implementation of social distancing
measures has shown to be necessary over a longer period of time which might have
a strong influence on adherence. Since no studies had been conducted on the
COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the searches, the findings may not be completely
representative of the present situation, but they provide an indication of ways to
improve the pandemic response. A future review will have to assess new lessons
learned and can benefit from the findings established in this work.
Finally, while it is sensible to try and evaluate social distancing broadly, and,
as this review has indicated, many findings apply to all aspects of social distancing, it
would be worthwhile to pay more attention to the specificities of each social
distancing measure, both for evaluating current literature, and for future research.
Conclusions
This review demonstrates that there is a range of barriers, on different levels, to the
implementation of social distancing measures. Some of the key findings are the need
for authorities to involve their communities, the need to provide continuous support
to those who adhere to social distancing, and the critical importance of good
communication. These and many other factors appear to influence acceptability of
social distancing and people’s adherence to measures that are necessary for the
pandemic response. Policies should be designed with these factors in mind to
ensure an effective, ethical and equitable pandemic response. The current situation
further calls for high-quality research to better describe mechanisms by which
acceptability and implementation of social distancing measures can be improved.
