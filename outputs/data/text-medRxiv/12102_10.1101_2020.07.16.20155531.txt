Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

46

Abstract

47

Introduction: Use of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in

48

combination with azithromycin, has raised safety concerns. Here, we report safety data from

49

three outpatient randomized clinical trials.

50

Methods: We conducted three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating

51

hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis and early

52

treatment for COVID-19. We excluded individuals with contraindications to hydroxychloroquine.

53

We collected side effects and serious adverse events. We report descriptive analyses of our

54

findings.

55

Results: We enrolled 2,795 participants. The median age of research participants was 40 (IQR

56

34-49) years, and 59% (1633/2767) reported no chronic medical conditions. Overall 2,324

57

(84%) participants reported side effect data, and 638 (27%) reported at least one medication

58

side effect. Side effects were reported in 29% with daily, 36% with twice weekly, 31% with once

59

weekly hydroxychloroquine compared to 19% with placebo. The most common side effects

60

were upset stomach or nausea (25% with daily, 18% with twice weekly, 16% with weekly, vs.

61

10% for placebo), followed by diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (23% for daily, 16% twice

62

weekly, 12% weekly, vs. 6% for placebo). Two individuals were hospitalized for atrial

63

arrhythmias, one on placebo and one on twice weekly hydroxychloroquine. No sudden deaths

64

occurred.

65

Conclusion: Data from three outpatient COVID-19 trials demonstrated that gastrointestinal side

66

effects were common but mild with the use of hydroxychloroquine, while serious side effects

67

were rare. No deaths occurred related to hydroxychloroquine. Randomized clinical trials can

68

safely investigate whether hydroxychloroquine is efficacious for COVID-19.

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

70
71

Introduction:
Hydroxychloroquine has in vitro antiviral activity against Severe Acute Respiratory

72

Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[1, 2] While in vitro data suggest that both

73

chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication, the latter is

74

generally considered less toxic and better tolerated. However, clinical data to date demonstrate

75

no conclusive efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.[3-5]

76

Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine impede SARS-CoV-2 replication.[2] Several

77

randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials are underway to evaluate hydroxychloroquine’s

78

safety and efficacy in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in both inpatient and outpatient

79

populations.[6]

80

In late March 2020, hydroxychloroquine had substantial positive coverage in the media.

81

However, the tide rapidly turned due to concerted efforts to inform physicians and patients about

82

the potential risks of taking the drug outside of clinical trial settings.[7] Several inpatient

83

treatment studies then went on to show increased cardiac side effects with hydroxychloroquine

84

and azithromycin.[8, 9] On April 24th, 2020, the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued

85

a caution against chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 outside of

86

hospital settings or clinical trials.[10] The FDA stated, “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can

87

cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT interval prolongation and…ventricular tachycardia.”

88

The FDA noted that QT prolongation was more common among persons receiving azithromycin

89

and those with prior heart problems or kidney disease.

90

Hydroxychloroquine nonetheless has a 65-year track record of safety when prescribed at

91

recommended doses in populations with normal liver and kidney function, and without pre-

92

existing cardiac arrhythmias.[11] In the medical specialties of tropical medicine and

93

rheumatology, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have routinely been prescribed without

94

baseline laboratory testing or EKG monitoring. Whether these tests should be performed in the

95

setting of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 is controversial. As it stands, a number of ongoing

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

96

clinical trials have been paused or halted by regulatory authorities over concerns related to the

97

potential for QT prolongation. Importantly, these safety concerns have risen from reports of

98

hydroxychloroquine use in hospitalized patients, who are more likely to have severe infections,

99

significant comorbidities and be on multiple concurrent medications.[12]

100

There are some features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which may predispose individuals

101

with COVID-19 to be more likely to have complications from drugs that prolong the QT than

102

healthy individuals. SARS-CoV-2 itself can enter cardiomyocytes and may cause direct cardiac

103

injury.[13-15] Multiple reports of increased arrhythmias in individuals with COVID-19 without

104

other cause, suggest SARS-CoV-2 itself may cause arrhythmias.[15] Alternatively, elevated

105

cytokines directly or in concert with cardiomyocyte damage, may predispose to arrhythmias.[16]

106

Additionally, COVID-19 is associated with significant electrolyte imbalances, including sodium,

107

potassium, and calcium as well as renal failure, each of which also predispose individuals to

108

arrhythmias.[15, 17] Therefore testing the safety of hydroxychloroquine in individuals with

109

COVID-19 specifically is valuable.

110

The safety of hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 in outpatients has not been

111

established, but is believed to be less risky in outpatients than inpatients.[18] To address

112

current knowledge gaps regarding the safety and tolerability of hydroxychloroquine in the

113

outpatient prevention and treatment of COVID-19, and to inform its future usage in the setting of

114

clinical trials, we present the safety data from three randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials

115

of hydroxychloroquine in North America.

121

evaluated: 1) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); 2) preemptive early treatment (PET),

122

(Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT04308668).[3, 19] Trial enrollment began on March 17, 2020,

123

concluded on May 6, and follow up was completed on May 20, 2020. The third trial assessed

124

pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04328467).

125

Enrollment for this third trial began April 6 and ended May 26, 2020, with follow-up concluding

126

on July 13, 2020.

127

In each of these trials, participants were randomized to receive placebo or hydroxychloroquine.

128

The PEP trial required participants to have a known exposure to a lab-confirmed COVID-19

129

case within four days either as a household contact or as a healthcare worker or first responder.

130

The PET trial enrolled persons with COVID-19 symptoms of four or fewer days duration and

131

either lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or high-risk exposure to a known case within 14 days of

132

symptom onset. The PREP required persons to be high-risk healthcare workers or first

133

responders with ongoing occupational exposure to COVID-19.

134

Hydroxychloroquine dosing for both the PEP and PET trials was 800mg load dosing,

135

followed by 600mg in 6-8 hours, and then 600mg daily for five days in total. Participants were

136

instructed to split their follow-up dosing in the event of gastrointestinal upset. In designing the

137

trials, investigators chose doses within the existing FDA-approved dosing range that were

138

modeled to achieve therapeutic concentrations from day 1 through 10.[20] Hydroxychloroquine

139

dosing for PREP was dosed at 400 mg orally once, followed by 400mg 6 to 8 hours later,

140

thereafter 400mg weekly or twice weekly for the duration of follow-up, up to 12 weeks. The

141

placebo was dosed similarly.

142
143
144

Study Participants:
Participants were enrolled in the three trials via internet-based surveys throughout the

145

United States and selected Canadian provinces. Full details are online (Clinicaltrials.gov

old, had an allergy to hydroxychloroquine, retinal eye disease, known glucose-6 phosphate

148

dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, known chronic kidney disease, stage 4 or 5 or receiving

149

dialysis, known porphyria, weight <40 kg, known QT prolongation, or receiving chemotherapy.

150

Current use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or cardiac arrhythmia medicines (flecainide,

151

amiodarone, digoxin, procainamide, propafenone, or sotalol) were also exclusion criteria. On

152

April 20, 2020, the FDA required additional exclusions of structural or ischemic heart disease

153

and personal or family history of cardiac QT prolongation, and medications that prolong the QTc

154

interval.

155

Health Canada mandated additional exclusions for Canadian participants. Women who

156

were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded, as were patients with: severe diarrhea or

157

vomiting; known cirrhosis with a history of encephalopathy or ascites; known prolonged cardiac

158

QTc interval, history of ventricular arrhythmia or history of sudden cardiac death; patients taking

159

additional medicines that had a high risk of prolonging the electrocardiogram QTc interval in

160

conjunction with hydroxychloroquine. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) in Ontario also

161

mandated that a physician perform a complete review of medications for participants above age

162

65, to exclude those with important drug-drug interactions.

163

Participants in the PEP and PET trials completed follow-up email surveys on Days 1, 3,

164

5, 10, and 14, whereas participants in the PREP trial completed weekly follow-up surveys.

165

Surveys obtained self-report of study drug adherence, side effects, new COVID-19 symptoms,

166

new COVID-19 testing, and hospitalization. For participants who stopped their study drug due to

167

side effects or other reasons, we encouraged them to continue observational follow-up and

168

completion of self-report surveys.

Results:
A total of 2795 individuals were enrolled into the three trials. The combined median age

186

was 40 years (interquartile range [IQR] 34-49) and 51% were women. The median weight was

187

79 kg (IQR 66-91). The majority of participants (74%) were healthcare workers and first

188

responders. Approximately 66% of the participants were taking no chronic medications, and

Post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment trials
Of 1312 (n=821 PEP; n=491 PET) participants randomized, 87% (n=1139) started study

193

drug and completed follow-up surveys. Of 130 participants who started drug but did not

194

complete follow up, vital status was obtained for 32% (42/130), and all were alive. For the

195

remainder, we performed an internet search for death records and found none.

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

196

Of 1139 who started study drug and reported side effect data, 29% reported one or

197

more side effects, with more side effects reported among those on hydroxychloroquine (40%)

198

versus placebo (18%) (Table 2). The most common side effects reported were upset stomach

199

or nausea (25% on hydroxychloroquine versus 9% on placebo), followed by vomiting, diarrhea,

200

or other GI symptoms (23% on hydroxychloroquine versus 6% on placebo), and neurologic

201

reactions, such as lightheadedness or dizziness (7% on hydroxychloroquine versus 5% on

202

placebo). Self-reported allergic reactions, occurred in 7 participants (6 on hydroxychloroquine

203

and 1 on placebo). There were no reported episodes of arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death.

204

Only 46 participants (4%) from the PEP and PET trials reported that they stopped the 5-

205

day treatment course due to side effects. The distribution of side effects was similar among both

206

trials. No serious adverse events, resulting in hospitalization, attributable to medication side

207

effects were reported.

208

Since gastrointestinal issues are known to occur in COVID-19, we compared side effects

209

between the placebo groups in the PEP group versus those who had COVID-19 in the PET

210

group. We did not identify a statistical difference in the incidence of nausea / upset stomach

211

reports in those with COVID-19 versus those exposed (11% vs. 8%, p=0.12). Similarly, the

212

incidence of diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, or other gastrointestinal issues did not differ

213

between those with COVID-19 versus those exposed (7% vs. 4%, p=0.14). The risk of having

214

any side effects did not differ by sex, age group, weight, or if one was a healthcare worker or not

215

(Table 3).

216
217
218

Pre-exposure prophylaxis trial
Interim data June 25, 2020, demonstrated that of 1483 randomized, 1402 had follow up

219

data. Overall, 409 (29%) individuals experienced at least one side effect during the study (Table

220

4). Side effects were higher for those receiving hydroxychloroquine: 36% of those on twice-

221

weekly dosing, 31% on weekly dosing, and 21% on placebo reported at least one side effect.

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

222

Similar to the other trials, the most common side effects reported were upset stomach or

223

nausea (18% on hydroxychloroquine twice weekly, 16% on hydroxychloroquine weekly, and

224

12% on placebo), followed by vomiting, diarrhea, or other GI symptoms (16% on

225

hydroxychloroquine twice weekly, 12% on hydroxychloroquine weekly, and 6% on placebo).

226

Two participants experienced atrial arrhythmias. One participant on placebo was hospitalized

227

twice with atrial fibrillation. Another participant on hydroxychloroquine twice weekly was

228

hospitalized after a syncopal event and was found to have a supraventricular tachycardia. No

229

ventricular arrhythmias were reported.

230

In total, across the three cohorts, 25 individuals have been hospitalized through June 25,

231

2020 (1% incidence). The PEP trial had two hospitalizations, one in each arm and no deaths.

232

The PET trial had 14 hospitalizations and two deaths. With hydroxychloroquine, 4

233

hospitalizations and 1 non-hospitalized death occurred. With placebo, 10 hospitalizations

234

occurred with one hospitalized death. Two hospitalizations were for non-COVID-19, non-study

235

medication related reasons, while the remaining 12 hospitalizations were due to COVID-19.

236

Nine individuals were hospitalized from the PREP study, one for COVID-19, two for arrhythmias

237

(one on hydroxychloroquine twice a day and one on placebo), and the other seven

238

hospitalizations were for non-study related reasons. No sudden unexplained deaths have been

239

reported in any of the three trials. Full details are in Supplemental Table 1.

242

Discussion:
Among 2464 participants reporting on side effects from 3 randomized clinical trials

243

investigating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in outpatient COVID-19 prevention and

244

treatment, 27% reported at least one medication-related side effect. We captured one episode

245

of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with syncope in an individual on hydroxychloroquine and

246

two episodes of atrial fibrillation in one individual on placebo. Whether hydroxychloroquine was

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

247

responsible or contributed to the development of the supraventricular tachycardia is unclear.

248

Hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and therefore is associated with an increased risk

249

of ventricular arrhythmias, not atrial arrhythmias. Regardless, atrial arrhythmias were rare in

250

both arms, and there were no episodes of ventricular arrhythmia or sudden death in

251

approximately 50,000 patient-days of cumulative exposure.

252

As expected, the most common side effects were nausea and gastrointestinal upset. In

253

addition to hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19 is also known to cause gastrointestinal upset.

254

However, when we compared the rate of gastrointestinal upset among those receiving placebo

255

in the post-exposure prophylaxis cohort versus those in the symptomatic cohort, reported

256

gastrointestinal side effects were not significantly more frequent. Most participants regarded

257

gastrointestinal upset upset as tolerable and completed the course of medication.

258

Medications causing QT prolongation are feared due to the risk of inducing ventricular

259

arrhythmias, yet reports of arrhythmias due to hydroxychloroquine use are most often reported

260

in the setting of co-ingestion, chronic use, or overdose.[21-23] The FDA does not recommend

261

hydroxychloroquine be used with other agents that prolong the QTc,[11] such as

262

azithromycin.[24] In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that there has never

263

been a reported sudden cardiac death attributable to chloroquine when prescribed at malaria

264

treatment doses.[25] Despite the long history of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine for malaria

265

treatment and rheumatological diseases such as lupus, there have been increasing concerns

266

around side effects in patients with COVID-19, especially related to arrhythmias.[26, 27] The

267

FDA has now changed their emergency use authorization recommendation for

268

hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 treatment and prevention for this reason, among many others.

269

[10]

270

For context, a perspective on dosing is needed to understand potential risks with

271

chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Decades of safety data are available for the standard doses of

272

chloroquine used for malaria prophylaxis (500 mg [300 mg chloroquine base] weekly) and

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

273

malaria treatment (2.5 g [1.5g chloroquine base] total over three days). Cardiac conduction

274

alterations were mostly seen when using much higher doses in hospitalized patients with

275

COVID-19 (12 g chloroquine base over 10 days).[9] The cumulative dose of

276

hydroxychloroquine-base used in our PEP and PET trials is 3.8 g (2.9 g base) total over 5 days.

277

This is in line with established safe dosing strategies and below the doses shown to cause

278

harmful effects.[28, 29] The Outcomes Related to COVID-19 Treated with Hydroxychloroquine

followed by 200 mg twice daily for five days total (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04332991).

281

They enrolled 479 individuals and also found no significant safety concerns at that dose.[30]

282

Similarly, the RECOVERY trial used 2.4 g (1.86 g base) in four divided doses over 24 hours,

283

followed by 800 mg (620 mg base) for an additional 9 days or until discharge and they reported

284

no significant safety concerns in 11,000 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 randomized to

285

hydroxychloroquine or placebo.[31]

286

Our trials additionally excluded participants taking azithromycin and other QT-prolonging

287

drugs to enhance safety further. Other risk factors for QT prolongation, such as hypokalemia or

288

hypomagnesemia, are uncommon in outpatients.[32, 33] Mercuro, et al. found QTc prolongation

289

at 2.4 g courses of hydroxychloroquine over five days, but only clinically concerning side effects

290

when combined with azithromycin and side effects were more common among those already on

291

loop diuretics.[8] Our data showed one potential cardiac complication (atrial arrhythmia) in one

292

individual on hydroxychloroquine and one on placebo. Our potential rate of atrial arrhythmias

293

due to hydroxychloroquine is less than one in 1000. Many commonly used drugs, including

294

antibacterial, antifungal, and other antimalarial drugs, are known to prolong the QT, thereby

295

having a rare occurrence of arrhythmias.[34] The risk of QT prolongation has not precluded the

296

use of drugs such as ciprofloxacin or fluconazole in most patients, but has required clinicians

297

exercise caution.

Safety of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19

298

Despite our rational design of these clinical trials, several limitations still exist. A

299

significant limitation of our studies is related to their pragmatic nature, which relied on accurate

300

self-reporting. We did not prospectively record or evaluate for laboratory abnormalities or QTc

301

changes. While we have outcome data on 93% of participants who have completed the studies,

302

it is possible, given the passive nature of self-reported follow-up, that those lost-to-follow-up

303

may have had an adverse event that was not reported to our study team or their designated

304

emergency contacts. Additionally, our cohorts are relatively young, with a median age of 40.

305

They had few comorbidities and were on few medications. They were also predominantly

306

healthcare workers, comprising a population of individuals with high health literacy. All these

307

factors make our outpatient research participants healthier than most hospitalized patients in

308

North America. Finally, our study exclusively included outpatients. Patients admitted to hospital

309

are generally older and have more comorbidities. They also are more likely to have cardiac

310

complications of COVID-19 and thus may be more susceptible to develop adverse effects from

311

hydroxychloroquine.

312
313

Conclusion

314

While efforts towards the development of a vaccine continue, agents that can prevent

315

and treat COVID-19 are important. There is still equipoise concerning the potential efficacy of

316

hydroxychloroquine as an effective agent against COVID-19; thus, timely completion of

317

randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials is essential. Thus, large scale clinical trials to

318

carefully evaluate the limited potential therapeutics that have been identified and perhaps even

319

to replicate results of completed trials are imperative to our public health response. Ongoing

320

clinical trials can safely continue with research participants and regulatory bodies reassured as

321

to the general safety of hydroxychloroquine when using appropriate exclusion criteria.
