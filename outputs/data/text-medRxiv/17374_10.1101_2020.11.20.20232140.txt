The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic.
The prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection provides
insights into the potential for some level of population immunity. In June 2020 we succeeded in
testing almost half of the population of an Austrian township with a higher incidence for COVID19 infections. Now we performed a follow-up study to reassess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2specific IgA and IgG antibodies. In 121 people, including 68 participants of the previous study we
found the prevalence of IgG and IgA antibodies remaining remarkably stable with 84% of our
cohort prevailing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which is only a slight decrease from 93% four
months before. Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 seroconvert, potentially providing
immunity to reinfection. Our results suggest a stable antibody response that we observed for at
least six months post infection with implications for developing strategies for testing and
protecting the population.
The world is still challenged by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic crisis with the second
wave culminating in autumn 2020 all over Europe, including Austria. It is still controversially
discussed to which extend and for how long previously affected people are immune to a recurring
infection. During the cause of an infectious disease, first immunoglobulin M (IgM) and
immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes, which are later replaced by
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Persisting IgG antibodies are essential for developing a longlasting immune response. In fact, more than 90% of people with known SARS-CoV-2 infections
robustly develop antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which comprises the receptor
binding domain (RBD), enabling the virus to access human target cells (Amanat et al., 2020;Long
et al., 2020a;Premkumar et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020). Thus, the antibody-based immune response
is likely to play a decisive role in immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
In June 2020, we tested almost half of the population of the Austrian township of Weißenkirchen
in the Wachau with a reported higher incidence for COVID-19 infections during the first wave in
early spring 2020. We used a sensitive laboratory-based ELISA method (Euroimmun), enabling the

semi-quantitative measurement of serum levels of IgG and IgA antibodies, specific for the SARSCoV-2 spike protein. In this pilot study (Ladage et al., 2020), we observed that 12% (99/835) of the
tested people were infected and in consequence developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG or IgA
antibodies (Figure 1A, left panel). 9% (72/835) were positive for IgG antibodies and 9% (75/835)
contained IgA antibodies, respectively. In June 2020, 6% (48/835) of our test population were
serum-positive for both, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and IgA antibodies.
In October 2020, we performed a small follow-up study to reassess the prevalence of SARS-CoV2-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in Weißenkirchen and neighboring communities. Blood samples
were obtained for detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as in the previous study. The study was in accordance with
guidelines by the local ethics committee and in approval of local and national authorities. We
tested a non-representative group of 121 people, including 68 subjects, which already participated
in the pilot study.
Among the 121 participants 58% (70/121) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA or IgG
antibodies (Figure 1A, right panel). 45% (55/121) were positive for IgG antibodies and 48%
(58/121) contained IgA antibodies, respectively. 36% (43/121) contained both IgG and IgA
antibodies. Out of those subjects that already participated 93% (63/68) already tested positive in
June 2020 (Figure 1B, left panel). 50% (47/68) were positive for IgG antibodies and 74% (50/68)
contained IgA antibodies, respectively. 56% (34/68) contained both IgG and IgA antibodies. In
October 2020, we found in 84% (57/68) SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG or IgA antibodies (Figure 1B,
right panel). 66% (45/68) contained IgG antibodies and 74% (50/68) contained IgA antibodies,
respectively. In 56% (38/68) both classes of antibodies could be found.
Thus, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies remained extremely stable
in the re-tested participants (Figure 1B, c.f. left and right panels). After four months we found
84% of our cohort to still have SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which is only a slight decrease
from 93% in the previous test in June 2020.
This could be due to a high persistence of individual antibody responses. However, the antibody
responses could wane in some individuals, which is superimposed by novel infections in other
participants of the same subpopulation. Therefore, we analyzed the changes in antibody
prevalence on an individual basis. 94% (44/47) of people with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies
in June 2020 were still positive for IgG in October 2020 (Figure 1C, left panel). In one person,
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies could be found the first time in October 2020. 88% (44/50) of
participants with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in June 2020 still contained marked IgA
levels in October 2020 (Figure 1C, right panel). In six subjects, IgA antibody responses were at first
detected in October 2020. Therefore, the persistence of antibody resistance in only marginally
influenced by novel infections. When considering the alterations of antibody prevalence on an
individual basis, the persistence of antibody responses remained very robust.

Consequently, 97% (33/34) of subjects having both SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies
in June 2020 still contained significant levels of both classes of antibodies in October 2020
(Figure 2). Notably, only in one subject the IgA antibody levels waned whereas the IgG antibody
level remained significantly high. Only three persons with IgG but lacking IgA in June 2020 lost
their IgG antibodies by October 2020. Surprisingly, five persons that lack IgA in June 2020
developed IgA by October 2020, then showing both SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies.
In five persons with IgA but without IgG in June 2020 their IgA antibodies waned by October
2020. Thus, the IgG antibody responses persisted very efficiently from June to October 2020, and
the waning of the IgA antibody response was surprisingly low. One would expect a significant loss
of the IgA antibodies because they are early and transient responders to an infection followed by
the production of the long-lasting IgG antibodies (Isho et al., 2020;Iyer et al., 2020). In contrast, in
our study a robust immune response with high levels of both SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA
antibodies guaranteed the most efficient persistence of human antibody response, at least within
the first six months after infection.
The SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibody levels may decrease over time in most individuals, but
as long as the signals are above the threshold of the applied ELISA test system, this waning could
be missed in our analysis so far. Therefore, we compared the relative IgG and IgA antibody levels
from June 2020 and October 2020 for every participant (Figure 3). Using a semi-quantitative
ELISA system, both the IgG and IgA antibody levels hardly waned between June and October
2020 (in average 10% for IgG and 14% for IgA). Indeed, in some cases, we even observed increased
IgG and IgA antibody levels over time. Thus, these data support our notion that the antibodybased immune responses were very stable in the tested population between June and October
2020. Since most known COVID-19 cases in Weißenkirchen were noted in March 2020, our data
propose that the antibody-based immune responses last for more than six months. This may also
have implications to the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A strong antibody-based immune
response involving both IgG and IgA antibodies upon vaccination, may be predictive for
immunity for more than six months.
For how long SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody persist providing immunity is still an open debate.
Several studies suggest that the immune response persists for at least several months (Baumgarth et
al., 2020;Crawford et al., 2020;Isho et al., 2020;Iyer et al., 2020;Ripperger et al., 2020;Rodda et al.,
2020;Wajnberg et al., 2020), whereas others propose quick waning of the SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies in the blood serum of previously infected individuals (Long et al., 2020b;Ward et al.,
2020). Our data support the idea of a prolonged immune response.
So far, studies determining antibody-based immune responses were performed with either corona
antibody rapid tests, which are less sensitive, or, as in our studies, with the state of the art
semiquantitative ELISA tests. Currently, ELISA methods for the quantitative assessment of SARSCoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies are emerging, which will allow a much more precise
determination of antibody waning post infection. In this study samples were measured with both
test systems in parallel for the comparison of the semiquantitative (see Figure 3) and quantitative
analyses (data not shown and to be published later) and to set a common base for following
studies.

In the light of these technological advancements and the still unclear knowledge about the
stability of SARS-CoV-2-triggered antibody-based immune responses, we will continue to
regularly test our cohort for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies with both
semiquantitative and quantitative ELISA, and combine these data with novel tests for SARS-CoV2-specific T cell immunity. Waning of immune responses is to be expected, and we will test
whether waning is influenced by age, sex, behavior (e.g. smoking, alcohol intake), weight, preexisting conditions. We will also consider the role of the previous COVID-19 disease severity, as
this has been proposed to influence the persistence of immunity with COVID-19 (Chen et al.,
2020). So far, we could not detect any significant correlation among the persistence of antibody
responses and these hallmarks, but this may change when antibody waning becomes more
relevant.
