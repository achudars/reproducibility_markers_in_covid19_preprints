Abstract: Background and Study Aim: COVID 19 is the terminology driving people’s life
in the year 2020 without a supportive globally high mortality rate. Coronavirus lead
pandemic is a new found disease with no gold standard diagnostic and therapeutic guideline
across the globe. Amidst this scenario our aim is to develop a prediction model that makes
mass screening easy on par with reducing strain on hospitals diagnostic facility and doctors
alike. For this prediction model, a neural network based on Chest X-ray images has been
developed. Alongside the aim is also to generate a case record form that would include
prediction model result along with few other subclinical factors for generating disease
identification. Once found positive then only it will proceed to RT-PCR for final validation.
The objective was to provide a cheap alternative to RT-PCR for mass screening and to
reduced burden on diagnostic facility by keeping RT-PCR only for final confirmation.

I. Introduction:
Towards the completion of a semi-annual tenure beginning from the first reported case of
COVID-19 on 29th January, 2020 in India, there has been a substantial rise in the number of
new cases and associated death rates across the country. Amongst 21 countries, a total of
9996 cases has been reported as on 30th January, 2020

[1]

. COVID-19 is an extremely

contagious disease capable of producing a global threat to health based on benchmark criteria
such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment

[2]

. According to WHO, 16,341,920 confirmed

cases has been reported as on 30th July, 2020 out of which deaths occurred in 650,805 cases.
In India alone, 1,531,669 confirmed infected cases have been reported out of which 34,193
died as on 30th July, 2020.
The SARS-COV2 viral disease has similarities with influenza in the early stages, which
makes it very difficult to diagnose. On the contrary, late diagnosis can lead to the death of the
subject as well as spread of infection. During an approach to develop a mass screening

procedure, a lot was accessed about the quantum of errors that might be there in the current
molecular as well as the serological procedures like RT-PCR and antibody tests. Since none
of the above tests are accurate and in the scenario of the non-availability of a gold-standard
procedure, the choice of test is based on its sensitivity and specificity. Country-wide RT-PCR
based approach to detect viral RNA is currently being used [3, 4].
Owing to the rise in COVID-19 cases across the globe, systemic utilization of healthcare
resources is of crucial importance. Machine learning technologies can be a significant
strategy in this situation for proper futuristic prediction that can help the administrators to
plan accordingly in terms of health care resources and its associated support mechanisms. As
the onset of disease is primarily in the lung of the infected person, so images of the lung
could give us a quicker and better predictive approach. But to make it quicker, we need to use
artificial intelligence and machine learning as a front-line analytical tool of the images [5-7].
Our main goal in this work is to develop a neural network-based prediction model that is
capable of distinguishing the COVID-19 viral infected patients from normal people as well as
from bacterial pneumonia based on the images of thoracic roentgenogram. The model takes
an input of the X-ray image and then analyses it to state the outcome. The benefit of this
procedure is based on user flexibility and associated facts: X-ray test is cheap, very fast
image development time, availability of the instrument in most clinics and hospitals across
the country. The additional benefits include scanning of the x-ray plate and uploading it into
the network doesn’t always require skilled manpower or medical personnel, hence it is
effective in mass screening and helps to reduce burden on skilled hospital labour and prevents
overcrowding of hospitals. Associatively a Case record form (in Supplementary file) is
developed that has certain essential input spaces along with the network predicted result
which needs to be filled and can be done by anyone without prior training. Based on

collective outcome of the rest of inputs and network result, an initial screening is possible and
then, if needed, the patient can be sent to doctors based on the government and hospital
workflow guidelines. A schematic representation of the combined model is stated in figure 1.
II. Materials and Methods:
II.I Data source/Dataset Development and structuring.
During the course of this study, all data gathered is in the form of jpeg image files of thoracic
roentgenograms. These files have been acquired from different sources and have different
sizes. The main two main sources of Chest X-ray images were taken from GitHub
(https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)

and

Kaggle

(https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). These two datasets
have been fused and their data used to create our final dataset comprising of equal
proportions of COVID-19, bacterial, other viral and normal chest X-ray images [8, 9]. We have
also assumed that COVID-19 cases and viral pneumonia have similar symptoms and so these
images are merged into a single feature. After acquiring the images, we have created a pandas
data-frame of the image path and its corresponding label. Thus, our final dataset is a pandas
data

frame

containing

3840

images,

which

are

equally

distributed.

II.II Data cleaning and Data Augmentation.:
Preliminary data cleaning steps involved validating the image’s readability and conversion.
Since most of the images obtained were already pre-cleaned and verified, this step ran
relatively fast and only a small percentage, about 0.1% of the images were found to be
corrupted and hence were rejected from the study. Since the dataset has multiple images with
different image sizes, some amount of pre-processing had to be performed. The preprocessing step firstly converted these images to a single channel gray-scale image.

After this step, slight image enhancement techniques were done by passing it through a
sharpening filter. The final step was to convert the image to a 200*200 matrix and
normalising the values.
Also, in order to satisfy limited memory usage during the training phase of the model, a
suitable data generator was created which could generate random images of batch size 10 and
feed it to the network. This data generator was used for training as well as in the serving
phase, and all pre-processing steps used during training were also applied during the
production phase. The protocol structuring for the experiment was done in a systematic
manner as indicated in figure 2.
II.III Computational setting.
The training of the model was computationally expensive, primarily because it involved
convolutional neural networks, being trained on about 1000 images. This required high
memory and processing capabilities and so conventional laptops or PC’s could not satisfy
this. Hence majority of the training was carried out on a python notebook hosted on Google
Cloud platform. The underlying system configuration was 8 CPU’s, 32 GB of RAM and 1
TB of hard disk space. The models were written in Keras using a tensor flow backend.
Owing to the fact that Google Cloud platform has out-of-the-box support for tensor flow, to
ensure production level robustness and ease of deployment, it was chosen and all the training
was done on this platform. This also gave us the capability to deploy the model in future in a
scalable manner without the hassle of setting up servers and configurations.

II.IV Statistical analysis.:

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the distribution of the subjects. Then for the
group of subjects having normal distribution, unpaired t-test used. If one or both groups
didn’t have normally distributed data, Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison. All

III. Results:
III.I FEATURE SELECTION
There were not many feature selection steps involved in the study and hence all of the feature
selection steps have been omitted or carried out in the pre-processing steps.
III.II NETWORK ARCHITECTURE AND OPTIMIZATION
The input layer of the network consists of a 2D convolutional network with 32 filters
followed by a dropout layer. This is followed by another 2D convolutional layer with 64
filters and another dropout layer. This is again followed by 3 layers of a dense network, each
with 64, 32 and 16 cells respectively. The layers are activated using a RELU activation
function. The output layer consists of a soft-max layer with 3 output nodes. Categorical Cross
Entropy is selected as the loss function and the layers are trained using an Adam optimizer.
The final model consists of 157,373,475 trainable parameters. The output of the model is a
probability distribution spread across 3 class labels.
III.III TRAINING
The model was trained on a batch size of 10 images each of 200 * 200 in dimension.
Furthermore, the model was trained for 20 epochs and the dataset was shuffled after the end
of each epoch. The total number of samples trained in each epoch was 2688. The total

training time of the model was 1hour 15 minutes on the hardware. This time could be further
reduced by training on a lower number of samples or increasing the computational power of
the system. At the end of the training, the model was saved as a .pb file in the local file
system which could be later used to recreate the model. After multiple iterations, the best

study.

III.IV Prediction accuracy
The model gave an overall accuracy of 82% among the 3 different classes. This can be
further expanded as the following scenarios: •

The model provided 93.2 % accuracy when trying to detect whether a person is
normal or not i.e. it is able to differentiate a normal person from an infected person
with very high accuracy.

•

The model is able to detect with 74.9% accuracy that a person has Bacterial
pneumonia whereas in the rest cases it detects the person as having Viral pneumonia.

•

The model is able to detect with 76.5% accuracy that the person has viral pneumonia
whereas in the rest 23.4% cases it detects that the person has bacterial pneumonia.

The AUC score for the above data is 93.7%. Final accuracy of the model as tested on 1000
samples was found to be 81% and the sensitivity is 82% with a specificity of 90%. With more
and better-quality data, the accuracy can be further increased. The performance metrics of the
data was obtained using the confusion matrix with the help of Scikit Learn library.
III.V Statistical analysis:
COVID-19 is a respiratory pathogen caused by SAR-COV2 virus which has a probable
zoonotic origin. It mainly enters the body via the upper aero-digestive tract, and produces a
deadly attack on the lungs of the infected person with severe disease. Subjects predominantly
have respiratory distress or even worse being 'happy hypoxia', i.e. a state of oxygen

desaturation without significant shortness of breath and hence leads to a crucial delay in
seeking medical help, which might result in fatality. Mainstay of supportive therapy is
oxygen support and/or ventilation. We assumed that oxygen saturation may play a crucial
role in the survival of these patients. But from the datasets we saw that there was no
significant difference in the oxygen saturation level of the subjects who died of SARS-COV2
viral illness vis-a-vis those who recovered from the disease as shown in Figure 3. Hence, we
may say that although oxygen saturation is an important clinical marker of the disease, it
probably doesn't play a big role in predicting mortality.
IV. Discussion and Conclusion
The first documented case of corona virus appeared in 1960 followed by the death of about a
thousand patients in 2003, and finally a pandemic led by a different strain of corona virus in
2020. Irrespective of such a long history of affliction of the human race, scientists have been
unable to produce an officially available vaccine against this deadly air-borne virus [10].
Evidence of pathogenicity is directed by the fact that it can spread via air-borne droplets and
via asymptomatic patients across all ages which makes every age group susceptible. Even
patients can spread this virus after immediate recovery

[11]

. Hence, under the prevailing

circumstances, there is an urgent need to keep health-care officials safe from nosocomial
infection of COVID-19. This can be only done by early diagnosis followed by isolation, and
decrease of the patient burden on hospitals and associated intensive care units (ICU). This
scenario might be critically dealt with by implementation of machine learning based
methodology like a dynamic neural network based on thoracic roentgenogram

[12]

.

Nevertheless, the only drawback comes from the dataset development part as developing a
dataset during a pandemic is troublesome but very crucial for strategic planning in healthcare
organisations

[5-7]

. However, we predict that our model along with case record form (CRF)

can significantly contribute in quicker and cheaper way, for mass screening of patients (noninvasively) and also help in managing and streamlining health care centres and its associative
monitoring
