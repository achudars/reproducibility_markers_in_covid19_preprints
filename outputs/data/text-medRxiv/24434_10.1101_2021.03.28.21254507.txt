Background
The proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients has collapsed hospital care worldwide. The
need for alternative therapies for this group of patients is imperative. This study aims to compare
the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) compared with human immunoglobulin (IVIg)
in patients requiring the administration of high oxygen levels or mechanical ventilation.

Methods
This is a controlled, randomized, open clinical trial of patients with pneumonia secondary to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, that fulfilled criteria for severe or critical disease. They were randomized in
a 1:2 ratio; group 1 was administered IVIg at a dose of 0.3 grams per kilogram of ideal weight, in
an 8- hour infusion every 24 hours, for 5 days. Group 2 was administered 200 ml of CP infused in 2
hours, for 2 days. The primary outcomes were duration of hospitalization and mortality at 28 days.

Results:
One hundred and ninety (190) patients were randomized; 130 to the CP group, and 60 to the
IVIg group. Their average age was 58 years (IQR 47 – 72), and most were male (n= 119, 62.6 %). On
inclusion, 85.2 % of patients (n=162) were on invasive mechanical ventilation therapy. Overall
mortality in all included patients was 53 % (n= 102), with a median follow-up of 14 days (IQI 8 –
26). Mortality at 28 days was 45.2 % (n=86). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no
difference between groups neither in mortality on follow-up (53.8
(46.2

vs

vs.

53.3, p =1.0) nor at 28 days

43 %, p=0.75, Log Rank p = 0.83). Per-protocol analysis between treatment groups

vs 51.4 %, p=1.0) nor after 28
vs 42.87 %, p=0.92 Log Rank p = 0.54). Only 23 patients in the CP group received plasma

revealed no difference in mortality throughout hospitalization (51.5
days (42.1

with detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Conclusions:
In critically ill patients or on invasive mechanical ventilation for treatment of Covid-19, the use
of CP is not superior to IVIg in terms of hospitalization duration or mortality. The use of CP is based
on complex logistics and requires an assured level of antibodies if used therapeutically. IVIg does
not appear to be useful in this group of patients.

INTRODUCTION
A new class of coronavirus was reported in December 2019 as a cause of the acute respiratory

syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan China, leading to the development of COVID-19 disease, a

public health emergency that has affected most of the world´s population and has led to

thousands of deaths (1,2); in the United States, this disease is among the leading causes of death

among adults above the age of 45 since October 2020 (3).

COVID-19 manifestations may vary from mild symptoms to the development of the Acute

Respiratory Distress Syndrome (4), for which therapeutic strategies have, to date, been limited.

Multiple treatment options have been used but only a few drugs have been able to decrease

mortality in patients with pulmonary disease; their usefulness has varied depending on disease

severity and in some cases, their availability has been limited due to the magnitude of the affected

population throughout the world (5-8).

Interest in the use of convalescent plasma (CP) arose since the beginning of the pandemic,

based on the awareness of passive immunization strategies previously used in other viral diseases

(9-11); it was considered a safe and low-cost option so on August 23, 2020, the Food and Drug

Administration

(FDA)

in

the

United

States

authorized

its

emergency

use,

although

the

development of controlled clinical trials was still necessary to prove its efficacy (12).

The use of human immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proposed as therapy of viral diseases such as

influenza A H1N1. In a Covid-19 retrospective study, its administration in the first 48 hours after

symptom development decreased mortality and the risk of complications (13,14). However, there

is still great uncertainty on its possible effects due to the paucity of studies designed to test its

efficacy.

This trial analyzes the safety and efficacy of the administration of CP in comparison with IVIg in

critically ill patients due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

This is a controlled, randomized, open clinical trial including patients with secondary pneumonia

to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fulfilling severe or critical disease criteria, to compare the efficacy

and safety of CP administration in comparison with the use of IVIg.

We obtained convalescent plasma from individuals with a reactive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal

swab, a second negative test, and in an asymptomatic state in the previous 14 days.

In the

absence of a second RT-PCR, we included donors with an initially positive test, a minimum disease

course of 28 days, and that remained asymptomatic during the 14 days prior to donation.

Patients that were plasma donation candidates were selected in accordance with Mexican Official

Norms

(15).

Serologies

for

human

immunodeficiency

virus,

hepatitis

B,

hepatitis

C,

trypanosomiasis, and syphilis were also obtained.

Convalescent plasma was obtained by puncture of a peripheral vein and plasmapheresis (TERUMO

BCT, model Trima Accel®).

The quantity of extracted plasma varied according to body weight

between 200 ml and 600 ml, which were divided into 200 ml units, and subsequently stored and

frozen at -70°C.

Serum aliquots from donor patients were safeguarded to document the presence of anti-SARS-

CoV-2 IgG antibodies by immunochemiluminescence (ARCHITECT ABBOTT). Given the study´s

temporality and the availability of serological tests, all serological results were obtained after

plasma administration.

Patients included in the study had to fulfill the operational definition of a suspected or confirmed

case of COVID-19, and present criteria of severe pneumonia according to the ATS/IDSA guidelines

(16). We considered for inclusion those patients with: 1)

A positive nasopharyngeal and

oropharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 2) Pneumonia diagnosed by high-resolution CT scan

of the chest, and a pattern suggesting coronavirus infection, 3) Recently developed hypoxemic

respiratory failure or acute clinical exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary or heart disease, 4)

Requirement of respiratory support with a high-flow nasal cannula, defined as 60 liters with a 90%

inspired oxygen fraction or invasive mechanical ventilation with an orotracheal tube.

All hospitalized patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low-weight molecular

heparin or unfractionated heparin, according to international guidelines (17,18).

On the last week in June and based on the evidence obtained in the RECOVERY trial, we began the

administration of dexamethasone, 6 mg intravenously, every 24 hours for 10 days (19).

Patients were administered ivermectin, 12 mg if their weight was below 80 Kg, and 18 mg if it was

above 80 Kg; this treatment was established in all patients due to its theoretical and potential

therapeutic

benefit.

We

concomitantly

conducted

a

clinical

trial

with

patients

requiring

hospitalization but that were not critically ill, to compare the safety and efficacy of ivermectin and

hydroxychloroquine (Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT04391127).

We performed an intermediate analysis in August 2020, that proved the therapeutic futility of

ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, so their administration was withdrawn in protocol patients.

Patients that were included signed an informed consent form, either personally or if unable due to

illness severity, by the responsible relative whose authorization was requested by telephone

following hospital safety measures.

Two treatment groups were randomized in a 1:2 ratio. Group 1 was administered human

immunoglobulin at a dose of 0.3 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight, in an 8-hour infusion

every 24 hours, for 5 days. Group 2 was administered 200 ml of CP over 2 hours, every 24 hours,

for 2 days.

On admission, we obtained blood samples to determine arterial blood gases, a complete blood

count, blood chemistry, and prognostic markers such as fibrinogen, D-dimer, ferritin, troponin I, C-

reactive protein, prothrombin time, and activated thromboplastin time; follow-up laboratory tests

were obtained according to the treating physician´s criterion.

The primary outcome was established as the duration of hospitalization, and the safety outcome

was patient death and/or the development of adverse effects following treatment administration.

The secondary outcome was the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation.

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Centenario Hospital Miguel Hidalgo, on

April 15, 2020, with the identifier number 2020-R-25. It was also registered in the clinicaltrials.gov

site with the identifier NCT04381858.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used depending on the measurement level. The distribution of

continuous variables was evaluated with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Continuous variables with

a normal distribution were expressed as means and standard deviation, while variables with an

abnormal distribution were expressed as medians and interquartile intervals. Categorical variables

were expressed as relative and absolute frequencies. Continuous variables in between-group

analyses were evaluated according to their distribution, with Student´s T or Mann- Whitney´s U.

2
Dichotomic and ordinal variables were analyzed with the χ test or Fisher´s exact test, as needed.
Survival analysis for the death outcome was conducted with Kaplan Meier curves, and between-

group comparisons were obtained with the Log-rank test. A p-value below 0.05 was considered

significant. We used Microsoft Excel 2013 and STATA version 11.1 software.

Between May 5 and October 17, 2020, we recruited 193 patients, 3 of whom were eliminated

due to hospital transfer and the inability to continue their treatment and surveillance. In the end,

190 patients were randomized: 130 to the CP group and 60 to the IVIg group. (Figure 1)

Average age was 58 years (IQR 47 – 72), with a predominance of males (n= 119, 62.6 %). The most

frequent comorbidity was obesity/overweight (n = 153, 80.5 %), followed by systemic arterial

hypertension (n = 67, 35.2 %), and diabetes mellitus (n= 66, 34.7 %). (Table 1 and Addendum 1)

At inclusion, 85.2 % of patients (n=162) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and the

remaining patients were managed with high-oxygen flow devices. The average initial oxygenation

index was 165 (IQI 96 – 240) (Table 2). Prognostic clinical markers on admission revealed a median

APACHE II score of 12 points (IQI 9 – 16), SOFA 3 points (IQI 2 – 4), and CURB-65, 2 points (IQI 1 –

2) (Table 3). Among inflammation biomarkers, median LDH was 479 U/L (IQI 367 – 658), D-dimer

was 1,300 ng/mL (IQI 800 – 3000), and ferritin was 584 ng/mL (IQI 324 – 1080). (Table 4)

Analysis of between-group differences only revealed that systemic arterial pressure was lower in

the CP group

vs

IVG (92

vs

95 mm Hg, p=0.03), and PaCO2 was lower in the IVIg group (30

vs

28

mmHg, p=0.01). There were no significant differences in the remaining characteristics.

In terms of protocol analysis, 95 patients received at least one plasma unit, and 70 patients

received IVIg. There were no significant differences between both groups. (Addenda 2 – 5)

Outcomes
Mortality among included patients was 53 % (n= 102) with a median follow-up of 14 days (IQI 8

– 26). Mortality at 28 days was 45.2 % (n=86). Intention-to-treat analysis showed no differences

between groups or in mortality throughout follow-up (53.8

43 %, p=0.75). (Table 5 and Figure 2)

Per protocol analysis revealed an overall mortality of 51.5 % (n= 85), and 42.2 % at 28 days (n=70).

The median duration of hospitalization was 12 days (IQR, 6 – 22). There was no difference in

mortality between treatment groups throughout hospitalization (51.5

vs

days (42.1

vs

51.4 %, p=1.0) or at 28

42.87 %, p=0.92) (Table 5). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 12

days (IQI 7 – 23), and there were no between-group differences.

Among the convalescent plasmas administered to 95 patients, the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2

IgG antibodies was determined in only 78 cases. Twenty-three patients (29.5%) received at least

one unit of plasma with antibodies. Mortality at 28-days did not differ whether antibodies were

present or not (43.4

vs 40%, p= 0.81), nor did the duration of hospitalization (18 vs 13 days, p

=0.08), nor the duration of mechanical ventilation (17.8

vs 18.6 days, p= 0.83.) Two plasma units

were administered to 53 patients; their 28-day mortality was 33.9 %, which was not statistically

different from that in the IVIg group (42.8 %, p=0.31).

Patients that did not receive treatment (n=31) had greater mortality (non- significant) in

comparison with those included in the treatment groups (54.8

vs 42.4 % p= 0.20).

Adverse Events
Two patients in the IVIg group developed adverse events associated with its administration; one

had an anaphylactic reaction, and the other developed a hypertensive crisis. The IVIg infusion was

immediately suspended in the first case, and antihypertensive treatment was initiated in the

second case. The CP group did not develop adverse effects attributable to its administration.

The most commonly observed complication was the development of shock, which occurred in 71%

In this study, the administration of CP was not superior to the administration of IVIg, both in

terms of mortality and hospitalization duration. The number of patients warranting mechanical

ventilation as well as its duration was also no different between groups.

Several published clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of CP administration in patients with

COVID-19, and their results have varied in function of the group characteristics. The clinical trial by

Ling Li et al was prematurely terminated due to a decrease in the number of cases during the

study since only half of the initially calculated sample was recruited; they included a total of 103

patients, the primary outcome was clinical improvement at 28 days, and no significant differences

were found. The subgroup of patients with severe disease had a superior outcome when

compared with placebo, 91.3

vs

68.2 % (HR 2.15, IC 95% 1.07 – 4.32, p = 0.03). Further, that trial

referred a significant decrease in viral load after 72 hours in the CP group, particularly in patients

with life-threatening disease (20). A second trial (PLACID Trial) included 464 patients with

moderate COVID-19 (PaFiO2 between 200 and 300), and there was no difference between the

treatment groups in terms of disease progression or death. However, they only included 19

patients on invasive mechanical ventilation per group (21).

Simonovich et al., as part of the PlasmAr group, conducted a clinical trial with patients with severe

pneumonia due to COVID-19; they found no significant clinical improvement nor differences in

mortality when compared with the placebo group. Despite assuring a minimal level of anti-SARS-

CoV-2 antibodies, there was no significant difference in mortality in comparison with placebo; the

CP was administered after 8 days (mean) since the initiation of symptoms. That study´s inclusion

criteria did not include patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. Among those that required

invasive mechanical ventilation during follow-up, no difference in outcome was noted (22).

Finally, a study by Libster et al. showed decreased COVID-19 progression in elderly patients with

mild infection to whom CP with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was administered within

the first 72 hours from symptom onset; a dose-dependent effect was reported, according to the

detected antibody titer in the administered plasma (23).

To date, there have been two clinical trials on the use of IVIg; the first included hospitalized

patients with persistent hypoxemia 48 hours after admission. They included 30 patients in the IVIg

group and 29 in the control group. Mortality was lower in the IVIg group (20 %

vs 48.3 %, p= 0.02).

(24) The second trial included patients with severe COVID-19, 52 patients were allotted to the IVIg

group, and 32 to the control group. They used an IVIg dose of 400 mg/kg, for three days. No

differences in mortality or duration of hospitalization were detected (25).

Our study included severely ill patients on invasive mechanical ventilation or with respiratory

deterioration as a result of their high mortality and a lack of therapeutic alternatives. We

compared CP against IVIg as passive immunization therapies and detected no differences in

mortality or duration of mechanical ventilation, perhaps as a result of the severe disease in

included cases and our inability to ascertain the level of antibodies in the CP group.

One of our study's weaknesses is the use of convalescent plasmas in which antibodies were not

measured since this is a limited resource in our setting. This occurred at the beginning of the study

and later, we were only able to conduct qualitative determinations.

But this study underscores the complexity of recruiting optimal plasma donors and the logistics of

its administration. This is clearly reflected in the large proportion of patients that did not receive

CP. On the other hand, the IVIg group was treated at pre-established times and with established

doses, with no relevant deviations from the contemplated protocol. Regardless, it did not prove to

be superior to CP which suggests therapeutic futility, at least in terms of the administered dosage

and the characteristics of our patient population.

CONCLUSIONS
In gravely ill patients and those on invasive mechanical ventilation as a result of COVID-19, the

use of CP without establishing an adequate level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is not superior to

the use of IVIg in terms of hospitalization duration or mortality. The use of CP is based on complex

logistics and ensuring an adequate level of antibodies is pivotal to its potential therapeutic use.

The administration of IVIg does not appear to be of use in this group of patients.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Recruited Patients. Among the 193 recruited patients, 3 were excluded due to hospital
transfer. In the group randomized to CP, 15 patients were administered IVIg due to the
unavailability of plasma, 6 patients received CP without randomization but had signed the
informed consent form, 31 patients did not receive plasma due to its unavailability. In the IVIg
group, 5 patients were transferred to the CP group due to IVIg unavailability. Per-protocol, 95
patients received CP and 70 received IVIg.
