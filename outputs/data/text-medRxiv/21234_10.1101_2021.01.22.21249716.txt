Abstract
Almost one year has passed since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, causing the COVID-19
pandemic. The number of confirmed SARS-Cov-2 cases worldwide has now reached ~92 million,
with 2 million reported deaths (https://covid19.who.int). Nearly 400,000 SARS-Cov-2 genomes
were sequenced from COVID-19 samples and added to public resources such as GISAID
(https://gisaid.org). With the vaccines becoming available or entering trials
(https://covid19.trackvaccines.org), it is vital to keep track of mutations in the genome of SARSCoV-2, especially in the Spike protein’s Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region, which could
have a potential impact on disease severity and treatment strategies.1–3 In the wake of a recent
increase in cases with a potentially more infective RBD mutation (N501Y) in the United
Kingdom, countries worldwide are concerned about the spread of this or similar variants.
Impressive sampling and timely increase in sequencing efforts related to COVID-19 in the
United Kingdom (UK) helped detect and monitor the spread of the new N501Y variant. Similar
sequencing efforts are needed in other countries for timely tracking of this or different variants.
To track geographic sequencing efforts and mutations, with a particular focus on RBD region of
the Spike protein, we present our daily updated COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker system, see
https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/covmt.
Main
We developed a daily updated COVID-19 virus Mutation Tracker system (CovMT, see
https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/covmt and Figure 1A) on SARS-Cov-2 isolate genomes deposited
to GISAID resource (http://gisaid.org), to track the worldwide sequencing efforts and the
evolution of the mutational landscape of this virus. CovMT summarizes mutations from nearly
400,000 isolates into groups of generic virus clades, lineages, and more specific mutation sets
we call Mutation Fingerprints (MF). These summaries, including associated metadata of
location, date of sampling, and patient disease severity information, where available, at the
continent and country levels, are accessible from the main page of the CovMT system.
CovMT also provides a particular focus on the timeline of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants
related to mutations in the RBD region of the Spike protein. Figure 1B shows a timeline graph of
how the N501Y mutation appeared for the first time in April in Brazil and the USA. It also shows

the number of isolate genomes significantly increasing after September 2020 when the N501Y
UK variant, B.1.1.7, was detected. As of January 2020, the spread of N501Y variants can be
detected in SARS-CoV-2 isolate genomes from 40 additional countries, using CovMT.
Nonsynonymous mutations in the RBD region have a high potential to be linked to increased
binding efficiency, increased infectivity, and the potential to evade antibodies.1–3 To track all
such variants, mutations in the RBD region are ranked based on their appearance in the number
of SARS-CoV-2 isolate genomes in the CovMT system. The CovMT timeline (Figure 1A) shows
that N501Y, S477N, N439K, and Y453F mutations can now be detected in more than 25,600,
20,900, 8,500, and 1,400 isolates, respectively, worldwide. An important RBD mutation, E484K,
likely to evade existing antibodies4, originally appeared in the Denmark during March 2020, is
now on the rise in South Africa4 since October 2020. More than 300 isolates show triple
mutations (K417N, E484K and N501Y, lineage B.1.351) in South Africa, with some isolates now
detected in the UK and 14 other countries. Timelines for top 10 RBD mutations can be explored
at CovMT, https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/covmt/index.php?p=top-rbd-variants and history of
mutations lineages at https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/covmt/index.php?p=mutation-history.

We defined Mutation Fingerprints (MFs) as the set of mutations present in the general
population with a frequency above 0.005%. This information provides a more specific
representation of all synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations found in an isolate of SARSCoV-2 to facilitate more specific geographic tracking of variants and project COVID-19 severity
information.
Location, date of sampling, and patient disease severity information, where available, are
summarized for an MF related to a set of isolates, see supplementary information. The
geographic origin status of an MF is considered foreign for a country if the earliest found
location linked to its MF is not in that country. We categorize patient disease severity status,
labeled evidence.host, as either asymptomatic, symptomatic mild, symptomatic severe, deadly,
or unknown. When there are isolates represented by the same MF but without evidence.host,
we impute the disease severity status as evidence.MF. In this way, we are able to project
evidence.host based patient disease severity status from available ~7% to ~20% of isolates
worldwide (see global COVID-19 severity information as an interactive circular graph or an
interactive MF table with timeline graphs). Taking the example of South African triple mutant,
B.1.351, around 319 unique MFs are available. Here, patient disease severity information is
available for at least 11 MFs, shown as symptomatic mild, one of such MFs appeared in the UK,
see supplementary.
In summary, CovMT provides daily updated tracking and timelines of geographic sequencing
efforts, mutations organized into known clades, newly defined MFs linked to local or foreign
variants, and disease severity information through an easy-to-use CovMT system. With a
particular focus on critical mutations in the RBD region of spike protein and with an option to
seamlessly accrue the clinical metadata, including disease severity, we believe that CovMT will
be useful for scientists, general public, and authorities to explore country-specific information.

Supplementary Materials
Here we explain an example Mutation Fingerprint (MF) taking the example of the South African
triple RBD mutation variant (K417N, E484K and N501Y) now detected in the UK, as highlighted
in the Figure S1 A, with an associated timeline of isolates shown in Figure S1 B, and spread to
other countries (lineage B.1.351 highlighted) in Figure S1 C, below. The MFs are more specific as
they are able to capture additional mutations not yet defined in known clades or lineages. This
allows to group all SARS-CoV-2 isolates with exactly the same set of mutations in to one MF.
Such an MF can then be exploited to track associated variants. Furthermore, an MF allows to
assign disease severity information if one of the isolates in a MF group are available with
original disease severity information, we call evidence.host.

C). History of B.1.351 with spread to several countries is shown.
A MF ID related to a single or set of isolates summarizes the location and date of earliest
isolate, a unique internal id, followed by associated clade and number of mutations detected,
as shown below:
Example MF ID: South_Africa.Knysna.2020-10-22.KAUSTmfID700450.GH:RBD.22
Mutations associated with an MF are recorded in a specific format, we call MF Signature, where
all detected mutations for each gene are kept together, separated by a delimiter, “|”. For each
gene, an MF signature shows the name of the gene or INTGEN for intergenic mutations,
followed by the count of mutations and coordinates at the protein level as well as genome
level, as shown below for the MF related to above shown MF ID:

All MFs are available for exploration at CovMT mutant variant table (1). As an example, to
search for the triple RBD mutant, one can use the text mentioned above, highlighted in yellow,
and search the MF signature field in MF table (1).
We searched the mutation N501Y as a query in the MF signature field of MF table (1), and
produced the following figure to show connections among first seen date, last seen date,
