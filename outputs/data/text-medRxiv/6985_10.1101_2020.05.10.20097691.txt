ABSTRACT
The number of patients, infected with COVID-19, began to increase very rapidly in India
from March 2020. The country was put under lockdown from 25 March 2020. The present
study is aimed at providing a simple algebraic analysis of the trend that is evident in the
spread of the disease in this part of the world. The purpose of this algebraic approach is to
simplify the calculation sufficiently by deviating from the standard techniques that are
conventionally used to construct mathematical models of epidemics. The predictions,
obtained from this algebraic study, are found to be in reasonable agreement with the recorded
data. Using this mathematical formulation we have determined the time variation of the
number of asymptomatic patients, who are believed to play a major role in spreading the
disease. We have discussed the effect of lockdown in reducing the rate of transmission of the
disease. On the basis of the proposed models, predictions have been made regarding the
possible trend of the rise in the number of cases beyond the withdrawal of lockdown. All
these things have been calculated by using very simple mathematical expressions which can
be easily understood and used by those who have a rudimentary knowledge of algebra.

Introduction

In early December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia had been reported in Wuhan, Hubei
province of China. A few days later, the health authorities of that country declared that this
cluster was associated with a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the
infectious disease caused by it was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the
World Health Organization (WHO) [1, 2]. This outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has
been declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. As of 6:37 pm
CEST, 10 May 2020, there have been 3,925,815 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including
274,488 deaths, reported to WHO globally [3]. According to WHO, no pharmaceutical
products have yet been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Invitro studies have shown that chloroquine, an immune-modulant drug, which has been
traditionally used for the treatment of malaria, is effective in reducing viral replication in
infections including the SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV) and MERS-CoV [4, 5]. It has
been revealed by the current studies that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever,
dry cough and dyspnea are the most common manifestations, quite similar to severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012
(MERS), which firmly indicates the droplet transmission and contact transmission of the
virus. Apart from the typical respiratory disorder, there are less common features like
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort that have been found significantly in
different degrees among different study populations [6]. Recent evidences have revealed that

routes [7-11]. Transmission through droplets takes place when a person is in close contact
(within 1 metre) with another person, who has developed respiratory symptoms (coughing or
sneezing) due to COVID-19 infection, and is thereby at risk of having his/her mucosae
(mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets
(which are generally known to be greater than 5-10 μm in diameter). Droplet transmission
can also occur through fomites in the immediate vicinity around the infected person [12].
Thus, the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 can occur by direct contact with an
infected person and indirect contact with surfaces in his/her immediate environment or with
the objects that have been used on the infected person (e.g. stethoscope or thermometer).
Airborne transmission of the virus is not the same as droplet transmission. It is caused by the
microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally like particles less than 5μm in diameter,
and which are released by the evaporation of larger droplets or exist within dust particles.
These particles may remain in the air for long periods of time and they can be transmitted to
persons over distances greater than 1 metre [13].
The first case of COVID-19 infection was reported in India on 30 January 2020. As of 8:00
am IST, 10 May 2020, a total of 62,939 cumulative cases of infection including 41,472 active
cases, 19,357 recoveries and 2,109 deaths in the country have been confirmed by the Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare [14]. So far, the government has issued necessary guidelines
and taken several measures to spread awareness regarding COVID-19 and also to enforce
social distancing of its citizens to break the chain of transmission of the disease. On 24 March
2020, a nationwide lockdown was announced for a period from 25 March 2020 to 14 April
2020. On 14 April 2020, this lockdown was extended till 03 May 2020. On 01 May 2020 it
was further extended till 17 May 2020.
Chatterjee et al. have carried out a detailed study to accumulate evidence that can guide
research activities towards the prevention and control such a pandemic spreading so rapidly
in India [15]. In another study, Agarwal et al have elaborately discussed the necessity for a
proper medical infrastructure to be built up in India to tackle the flow of patients and to
ensure the safety of the healthcare workers [16]. Through a detailed mathematical analysis,
Mandal et al have discussed the policies to be implemented to prevent the spread of the virus
by community transmission [17]. Some other mathematical models, based on several
standard theories, have been constructed to predict the number of infections of COVID-19 in
India with sufficient accuracy [18-25]. These models are expected to serve as efficient tools
which would certainly help the policy makers of the country, at different levels, to make
proper plans to prevent the spread of this disease.
In a previously published article, based on a mathematical model, we showed the effect of
imposition of lockdown in reducing the rate of rise in the number of infections [26]. It was a
dynamical model which was based on a differential equation that was formulated to find the
time variation of the number of asymptomatic patients, from which, the number of
symptomatic cases was estimated. In the present study, we have constructed the entire
mathematical structure upon a simple algebraic equation. The purpose of choosing this
method is to make the article comprehensible to the policy makers of the country who come
from various educational backgrounds. The models that are based on calculus lead to very
accurate results or predictions but they are sometimes very difficult to understand for those
who are not sufficiently trained in mathematics. In most of the cases, the conventional models
do not lead to mathematical expressions from which predictions can be made. One needs to
do numerical calculations (rather than analytical) to arrive at a prediction. In view of the
severity and urgency of the crisis caused by COVID-19 outbreak, mathematical models

should be created in a simple way so that the can be easily understood, amended or modified
if necessary and applied extensively by the persons who are responsible for decision making
regarding infrastructural arrangements and also the formulation and implementation of rules
to be imposed upon the society to ensure social distancing. The calculations involved in the
present study are extremely simple in comparison to the ones where one needs to solve a set
of coupled differential equations keeping under consideration various factors connected to the
society and the constraints of the actual situations caused by the pandemic and the measures
to control it.
In the present article, we have discussed the step by step construction of an algebraic
structure that allows one to derive an expression representing the time evolution of the
number of asymptomatic patients in the country. Like our previously published article, which
was based on calculus, this model has an underlying assumption that, due to the lack of tests
in sufficient numbers, the statistics regarding the number of patients infected, as declared by
the government, are actually about the number of symptomatic patients. After detection, most
of them are put under isolation, during which they are not much capable of spreading the
disease to other persons. Therefore, the asymptomatic carriers can be regarded as the main
agents of transmission of the virus in the society. The present study is based on three models
whose unknown parameters have been determined by fitting these models to the actual data
of COVID-19 infections in India. For this purpose we have used the statistics of the number
of infected persons in India, during the period from 01 March 2020 to 03 May 2020, obtained
from the government sources [14]. Using these three models we have determined the time
evolution of the number of infected persons over this period. We have graphically shown the
positive impact of the imposition of lockdown throughout the country. The present study
makes predictions regarding the number of infected cases beyond 17 May 2020, the date up
to which the lockdown will continue as per the last announcement made on 01 May 2020.
These models show very clearly that a high degree of social distancing has to be maintained
to slow down or prevent the transmission of the disease in the country.

Mathematical Models

Let and be the numbers of asymptomatic patients on the first and the second days of the
span of time under consideration. We propose to express

way.

In equation (1),

after coming in close contact with each of these
carriers of the disease, on the first day.

denotes the fraction of
who have undergone a transformation from asymptomatic
to symptomatic modes on the first day. It is assumed in the present model that a patient, after
being identified as symptomatic, is put into absolute isolation from the society. It prevents the
patient completely from playing any role in the transmission of the disease. It is also assumed
that no new asymptomatic or symptomatic carrier has entered the geographical region under
consideration, during the entire span of time for which this study has been conducted.
The subscript of
is connected to the serial number of the day concerned. When a lockdown
is imposed, the social mixing pattern changes significantly, resulting in a change in the
number of persons coming in contact with an asymptomatic carrier. Let us consider a
combination of three consecutive periods, of ,

days respectively, during which we

Its time dependence is due to an assumption that the number of asymptomatic patients may
increase at such a rate that, the fraction of them turning into symptomatic ones on a certain
day, cannot have a constant value. One of the three forms of , introduced in the present
paper, has been assumed to have a constant value (denoted by in section 2.3), which might

not beyond. The smallest value of the ratio of A/S is 3/2. Due to lack of tests in sufficient
numbers, the asymptomatic cases mostly remain undetected. Therefore, we may conclude
that for every two confirmed cases there are at least three undetected cases in India.
Figure 20 shows the time variation of the percentage of total Indian population infected with
COVID-19, with both asymptomatic & symptomatic modes taken together, over a period of
100 days since 01 March 2020 (i.e.

2020 (as per the announcement made on 01 May 2020) and not beyond. The present
population of India is

of the entire population can be infected, as per the prediction based on Model-1. A smaller
percentage is predicted by the other two models.

Conclusions

The present study is based on an assumption that a symptomatic patient is put into complete
isolation and thereby he/she is prevented completely from spreading the disease. This cannot
be entirely true under the present circumstances. The infection in the body of a person, who
has developed some symptoms, can remain undiagnosed mainly due to two reasons. One of
the reasons is that some of the symptoms are very much similar to those of other diseases
(caused by influenza viruses). The other reason is obviously the lack of testing facilities in the
country. This method of algebraic study or prediction can be improved by taking into
consideration the role played by the symptomatic patients in the transmission of the disease.
Another aspect, which has a plenty of scope for modification, is the functional form of
of
equation (6). Apart from the three choices, in this regard, described in the sections 2.1-2.3,
there can be many other functions that can represent the time dependence of this parameter.
We have chosen the simplest ones. A limitation of this calculation is that the values of the
parameters a and b, have been assumed to remain constant over the normal (i.e. pre/postlockdown) period and the lockdown period respectively. In reality, the social mixing or
distancing patterns may vary frequently with time during a pandemic. In spite of such
limitations, the predictions from these models are in reasonable agreement with the actual
records, for a certain set of parameter values. Based on this set, the most important finding of
the present study is actually a message that social distancing has to be maintained as
stringently as possible, which is quite evident from the Figures 13-18. The value of the
parameter b, which is an indicator of social distancing during lockdown, needs to be
sufficiently decreased, to cause to fall with time and also to get a flat curve for .
