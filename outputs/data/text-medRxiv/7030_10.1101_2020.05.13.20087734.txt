ABSTRACT

27

Background

28

Mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a mortality of

29

24–53%, in part due to distal mucopurulent secretions interfering with ventilation. Dornase alfa

30

is recombinant human DNase 1 and digests DNA in mucoid sputum. Nebulized dornase alfa is

31

FDA-approved for cystic fibrosis treatment. DNA from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)

32

contributes to the viscosity of mucopurulent secretions. NETs are found in the serum of patients

33

with severe COVID-19, and targeting NETs reduces mortality in animal models of acute

34

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Thus, dornase alfa may be beneficial to patients with

35

severe COVID-19—acting as a mucolytic and targeting NETs. However, delivery of nebulized

36

drugs can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, increasing the infection risk for

37

staff. Here, we report a single center case series where dornase alfa was administered through

38

an in-line nebulizer system to minimize risk of virus aerosolization.

39
40

Methods

41

Demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were collected from the electronic medical records of

42

five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19—including three requiring veno-venous

43

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO)—treated with nebulized in-line endotracheal

44

dornase alfa co-administered with albuterol (used to increase delivery to the alveoli), between

45

March 31 and April 24, 2020. Data on tolerability and responses, including longitudinal values

46

capturing respiratory function and inflammatory status, were analyzed.

47
48

Results

49

Following nebulized in-line administration of dornase alfa with albuterol, the fraction of inspired

50

oxygen requirements was reduced for all five patients. All patients remain alive and two patients

51

have been discharged from the intensive care unit. No drug associated toxicities were identified.

Conclusions

54

The results presented in this case series suggest that dornase alfa will be well-tolerated by

55

critically ill patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are required to formally test the dosing, safety,

56

and efficacy of dornase alfa in COVID-19, and two have recently been registered

57

(NCT04359654 and NCT04355364). With this case series, we hope to contribute to the

58

development of management approaches for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND

79

Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute

80

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), progress to hypoxemic and then mixed

81

respiratory failure, secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1, 2).

82

Approximately 79–88% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19

83

require intubation and mechanical ventilation, with a mortality of 24–53% (3-6). ARDS in

84

COVID-19 is characterized by ventilation failure, in part attributable to distally located

85

mucopurulent secretions.

86
87

Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®) is recombinant human DNase 1 and a safe mucolytic that is

88

administered in nebulized form. It is FDA-approved in combination with standard therapies for

89

patients with cystic fibrosis to improve sputum clearance and pulmonary function (7). It is also

90

used off-label as a mucolytic in other diseases, including ARDS (8, 9). A mechanism by which

91

dornase alfa might improve ventilation is by reducing the DNA-mediated viscosity of neutrophil-

92

rich secretions (10). There are multiple sources for the DNA in mucoid sputum, one of which is

93

neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Recently, we collaboratively reported that in the discarded

94

serum of patients with COVID-19, the levels of NETs were increased and were correlated with

95

lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (11). Targeting

96

NETs reduces mortality in animal models of ARDS (12). Despite recognition that mucolytic

97

treatment may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19, administration of nebulized

98

medications, such as dornase alfa, have been limited due to risk of viral aerosolization. If risk of

99

viral aerosolization can be avoided, dornase alfa may benefit patients with severe COVID-19. by

100

acting as a mucolytic and by reducing NET levels in the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation

101

and ventilation. We report the clinical course, safety, and outcomes after nebulized in-line

102

endotracheal dornase alfa treatment for five intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with

103

PCR-confirmed COVID-19.

METHODS

106

The Northwell Health institutional review board that focuses on COVID-19 research approved

107

this case series as minimal-risk research using de-identified data from routine clinical practice.

108

Data were collected from the enterprise health record (Sunrise Clinical Manager; Allscripts)

109

reporting database, and included patient demographics, comorbidities, inpatient medications,

110

laboratory studies, treatment, and outcomes. We further obtained longitudinal values of FiO2

111

and of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) as measures of respiratory

112

function during treatment. FiO2 values of the circuit were reported for those patients who

113

required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Ferritin, CRP, LDH,

114

and D-dimer were obtained as measures of systemic disease and inflammation. Not all patients

115

had laboratory investigations on the same days in relation to the nDA+A treatment. In the

116

following case synopses, each measurement is therefore followed by the day in relation to the

117

first day of treatment with nDA+A (e.g. d 2 for the second day of treatment with nDA+A or d -1

118

for the day before nDA+A treatment was initiated).

119
120

RESULTS

121

Five patients treated with dornase alfa between March 31, 2020 and April 24, 2020 were

122

identified. These patients had met the Berlin criteria for ARDS and were treated with ventilator

123

strategies guided by the ARDSNet protocol at North Shore University Hospital within Northwell

124

Health (13). They had been treated with dornase alfa because they required high levels of

125

fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and had elevated ventilation demands. All patients received

126

the same treatment doses: nebulized dornase alfa (2.5 mg) co-administered twice daily with the

127

short-acting β2-agonist albuterol (2.5 mg, hereafter abbreviated as nDA+A) to improve delivery

128

to the alveoli. Of note, β2-adrenoreceptor agonism may also inhibit NET formation by direct

129

action on neutrophils (14). The treatment was administered with an Aerogen® Solo in-line

nebulizer to avoid open aerosol generation, which would place staff at risk of exposure to

131

SARS-CoV-2.

132
133

The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Patients were treated with nDA+A

134

between 3 to 25 days. The most common characteristics of the patients included obesity

135

(BMI≥30) and four of the patients had hypertension. Four patients received methylprednisolone

136

dosed at 1-2mg/kg/day. All patients were treated with full dose or prophylactic dose

137

anticoagulation for thrombosis. All other medications that were administered during the course

138

of hospitalization are summarized in Table S1. The clinical course of the five patients treated

139

with nDA+A is summarized in Figure 1. Figure 2 and 3 display the longitudinal, ventilatory, and

140

inflammatory markers for each patient.

141
142

Patient 1 is a 56-year-old Hispanic woman who presented in respiratory distress. Her respiratory

143

status deteriorated over 48 hours, requiring intubation and transfer to the ICU. She was treated

144

with nDA+A for six days, starting from day 9 of intubation. The FiO2 requirement decreased from

145

70% (d -1) to 30% (d 6), PaCO2 from 58 (d -1) to 37 mmHg (d 7), ferritin from 1,803 (d -1) to 472

146

ng/mL (d 6), and D-dimer from 1,619 (d -1) to 563 ng/mL (d 6). Minimal changes were noted in

147

CRP and LDH. The patient underwent a tracheostomy after 23 days of endotracheal intubation

148

and remains on an FiO2 of 30% while pending return of mental status.

149
150

Patient 2 is a 34-year-old white man who presented to the hospital in diabetic ketoacidosis

151

without prior history of diabetes mellitus. He was intubated on admission and initiated on VV-

152

ECMO. He received nDA+A for three days and was de-cannulated after 12 days. The FiO2

153

requirement decreased from 100% (d 0) to 80% (d 3), CRP from 14.14 (d 0) to 2.41 mg/dL (d 3),

154

ferritin from 12,281 (d 0) to 5,453 ng/mL (d 3), and D-dimer from 5,210 (d 0) to 2,099 ng/mL (d

155

3). Minimal changes were noted in PaCO2 and LDH. The patient remains intubated.

157

Patient 3 is a 65-year-old Asian man who was admitted directly to the ICU for respiratory

158

distress and intubated three days later. Twelve days after intubation, he was started on nine

159

days of nDA+A treatment. The FiO2 requirement decreased from 50% (d -1) to 40% (d 7),

160

PaCO2 from 55 (d 0) to 43 mmHg (d 6), and CRP from 22.07 (d 0) to 26.48 mg/dL (d 6). Minimal

161

changes were noted in ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer. He was extubated one day after the

162

completion of the nDA+A course. Six days later, he was re-intubated for an additional four days

163

due to mental status changes and failure to protect his airway. The patient remains extubated in

164

ICU care.

165
166

Patient 4 is a 31-year-old Hispanic man who was intubated and transferred to the ICU from the

167

Internal Medicine service two days after presenting with respiratory distress. Nine days after

168

intubation, he was initiated on VV-ECMO. Five days after cannulation, he was started on the

169

nDA+A treatment. After nine days, he was de-cannulated and remained intubated for ten days

170

while continuing the nDA+A treatment. He was then extubated and discharged to the floor. The

171

FiO2 requirement decreased from 90% (d -1) to 21% (d 7) and LDH from 1,054 (d -1) to 451 U/L

172

(d 7). Ferritin initially decreased from 1,669 (d -1) to 387 ng/mL (d 7). On day 15 of treatment,

173

he developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and bacteremia.

174

Ferritin thus increased to 1,619 ng/mL (d 13) prior to decreasing to 555 ng/mL (d 19) with

175

antibiotic treatment. Minimal changes were noted in PaCO2, CRP, and D-dimer.

176
177

Patient 5 is a 34-year-old black woman who was intubated at an outside hospital, then

178

transferred to the North Shore University Hospital ICU. Two days later, she was cannulated for

179

VV-ECMO. She required VV-ECMO for 13 days and was intubated for a total of 29 days. She

180

was treated with nDA+A for 25 days starting three days following intubation and cannulation.

181

While on VV-ECMO for the first five days, CytoSorb therapy was applied. She was de-

182

cannulated after 23 days, extubated after 4 days, and discharged to the floor. The FiO2

183

requirement fell from 80% (d -1) to 40% (d 7), ferritin from 1,244 (d -1) to 535 ng/mL (d 7), and

184

LDH from 844 (d -1) to 693 U/L (d 7). Minimal changes were noted in PaCO2, CRP, and D-

185

dimer.

186
187

DISCUSSION

188

At the doses utilized, no nDA+A treatment-associated toxicities were identified. FiO2

189

requirements decreased for all five patients seven days after nDA+A treatment was initiated. All

190

patients remain alive at the time of submission of this report, with two patients discharged from

191

the ICU. We recognize that these FiO2 changes may be independent of the nDA+A treatment.

192

Clinical trials are therefore required to test the dose range, safety, and efficacy of dornase alfa

193

in patients with COVID-19 in this setting and possibly earlier in the disease course. Endpoints

194

should include measurements of the effect on respiratory function as well as on systemic

195

inflammation, coagulopathy, secondary infections, and the presence of NETs in plasma. Two

196

such trials were recently registered (NCT04359654 and NCT04355364).

197
198

It is not clear whether nebulized dornase alfa will have any effect on blood NET levels or

199

systemic inflammation in COVID-19, but a reduction in systemic inflammatory markers has been

200

reported after use of dornase alfa in patients with cystic fibrosis (7). We did note a reduction in

201

CRP in two patients (patients 2 and 3) and a reduction in D-dimer in two patients (patients 1 and

202

2) during nDA+A treatment. LDH was reduced for the patients on VV-ECMO during nDA+A

203

treatment, and ferritin was reduced in four out of five patients. Due to the small sample size and

204

the common occurrence of secondary infections in ventilated patients with COVID-19, we are

205

unable to comment on any potential relationship between nDA+A administration and the risk of

206

secondary infections.

CONCLUSIONS

209

Nebulized dornase alfa in combination with albuterol may be a safe treatment option for

210

mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19, including for those on VV-
