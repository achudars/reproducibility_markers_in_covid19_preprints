Abstract
Background: There is a major concern regarding the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) in patients who recovered to first-time illness.
Objective: To evaluate factors predicting severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed
(reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR) SARS-COV-2
(severe acute coronavirus-2) reinfection.
Method: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico and data from
258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We
used risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate predictors of severe
(dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-COV-2 infection.
Results: The risk of severe disease was 14.7% and the observed overall fatality rate was
4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe
symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors
associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection were
increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely obesity
[RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes
mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38] and previous severe laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating disease
outcomes in a large set of laboratory-positive cases of symptomatic SARS-COV-2
reinfection and factors associated with illness severity was characterized. Our results may
contribute to the current knowledge of SARS-COV-2 pathogenicity and to identify
populations at increased risk of a poorer outcome after reinfection.

Introduction
The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) by SARS-COV-2 (severe acute respiratory
coronavirus 2) pandemic has had a major impact in healthcare systems. In Mexico, by
middle October 2020, more than 800 confirmed cases and nearly 85 thousand deaths had
been registered [1].
Reinfection risk is a major debated related to the COVID-19 pandemic, even when there is
not a consensus regarding its definition [2]. Given the high observed mortality in Mexico,
there is concern regarding the impact of subsequent COVID-19 in recovered patients. The
aim of this study was to evaluate factors predicting severe SARS-COV-2 symptomatic
reinfection in a large and nationwide cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 survivors.
Methods
We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study including adults (aged 20 years or
older) with laboratory-confirmed symptomatic (quantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR; nasopharyngeal or deep nasal swabs were employed)
SARS-COV-2 reinfection. The research group previously published a broader description
of the employed methods [3].
Subjects with primary COVID-19 onset from March to July 2020, who recovered to severe
or non-severe illness (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) were eligible. The main binary
outcome was severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed (RT-qPCR) and it was defined by
the reappearance of COVID-19 symptoms at 28 days or above from a primary laboratorypositive COVID-19 [4].
Clinical and epidemiological data of interest were obtained from medical files and death
certificates, if applicable. We used linear regression models to calculate risk ratios (RR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate factors associated with the risk of severe
symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection. The next models were built: one for each evaluated
predictor and a multiple model. The Health Research Committee 601 of the Mexican
Institute of Social Security provided approval (R-2020-601-015).

Results
Data from 100,432 first-time and recovered COVID-19 patients were analyzed and 258
laboratory-confirmed cases of reinfection were identified (0.26%). The study profile is
presented as Supplementary Figure 1.
Median elapsed days between first and second time COVID-19 were 56 days (interquartile
range, IQR, 40-81), and no significant differences were observed between patients with
non-severe and severe primary disease (p = 0.431). Most of the participants who testedpositive for SARS-COV-2 reinfection were female (53.9%) and were aged 49 years or
younger (81.8%). The overall risk of severe subsequent illness was 14.7% (n = 38). The
observed fatality rate was 4.3% (11/258) and it was higher among patients with severe
symptoms (23.3% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001).
When severe and non-severe second-time infections were compared, patients with more
serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, p <
0.001), as well as those aged 50 years old or above (52.6% vs. 12.3%, p < 0.001). In
general, the prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases (namely type 2 diabetes
mellitus, arterial hypertension, and kidney disease) was higher among severe subsequent
cases. Other characteristics of interest are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
In multiple analysis (Table 2), factors associated with a more severe symptomatic SARSCOV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RR per year = 1.007, 95% CI 1.003-1.010) and
personal history of obesity (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24), asthma (RR = 1.26, 95% CI
1.06-1.50), type 2 diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.38) and chronic kidney
disease (RR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.21-1.80). Subjects with previous severe COVID-19, had a
20% increased risk (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39) of also presenting severe symptoms
during secondary disease.
Discussion
The results from our analysis characterized factors determining the risk of severe
symptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection. However, and since currently there is not a
consensus regarding the definition of SARS-COV-2 reinfection, our findings must be

carefully considered. The cut-out points that we used, that corresponds to one of the criteria
proposed by Tomassini et al. [2], seems highly plausible since it is based in the observed
viral decay in laboratory-positive cases of COVID-19 [5]. All the enrolled subjects from
our study became asymptomatic between both episodes.
We would like to highlight that enrolled patients who recovered to severe primary illness
had a 20% increase in the risk of severe subsequent disease (RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.39).
Besides, a shorter interval between both disease episodes was documented in patients with
severe primary illness (median days [IQR]: 48 [33-62] vs. 57 [41-84]; p = 0.040).
If later replicated in other populations, this finding may be highly relevant for public health
policymakers since it would imply that: i) even when higher antibodies titers have been
documented among patients with severe COVID-19 [5], these would not protect them from
a secondary severe illness about 4-8 weeks later and ii) these initially recovered patients
would benefit from particularly strict measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viral
pathogens. However, in our study sample, the risk of second-time disease seemed to be low
(0.26%).
The rest of the factors predicting severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection (namely
increasing age, obesity, asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease) did
not seem to differ from those determining a severe primary disease [6]. These findings
support that medical and control interventions in subsequent COVID-19 cases, in general
terms, do not seem to differ from primary infections [7].
Interestingly, most of the laboratory-positive second-time cases were young (under 50 years
old). A reduced COVID-19 awareness among younger subjects may be implied [8],
particularly due to a high prevalence (87.0%) of non-severe primary illness in this age
group.
The potential limitations of this study must be cited. First, the utilized definition of severe
COVID-19 in our study represents a limitation that must be cited given that no laboratoryrelated data (e.g. PaO2) was collected. However, a meta-analysis including 15 studies
evidenced that dyspnea is a stand-alone prognostic factor of COVID-19-related mortality
[9]. Besides, and according to normative standards that have been followed since the

beginning of the pandemic in Mexico, hospitalization criteria include the use of validated
scales as PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index) and CURB-65 (Confusion, Urea level,
Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, and age ≥ 65) [10]. Therefore, this severity indicator
seems to be plausible in the study population.
Second, since no mass screening has been performed in Mexico, we were unable to identify
second-time asymptomatic cases of SARS-COV-2 infection. Moreover, an undetermined
fraction of patients that are currently being identified as primary COVID-19 may
correspond to subsequent infections and the related public health implications are unknown.
Conclusions
We identified factors predicting severe symptomatic SARS-COV-2 reinfection, which
seemed to be a rare event. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to
characterize clinical outcomes in patients with second time COVID-19. If later replicated,
our results may be highly useful for implementing interventions focusing on the reduction
of disease burden in populations at risk, including vaccination efforts.
