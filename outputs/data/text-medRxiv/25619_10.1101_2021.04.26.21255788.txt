Abstract
Background
In most countries, healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a priority group for vaccination against
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to their elevated risk of COVID19 and potential contribution to nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concerns have been raised
that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World
Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are
limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs.

Methods
Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and
non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting
for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy
in qualitative data using a framework analysis.

Findings
11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy.
Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed
White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%),
and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted
analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be
hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a
COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the
previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified
the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns
due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing
and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be
improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting
vaccination through trusted networks.

Interpretation
Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be
vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths
surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Public health
communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and utilise trusted networks.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched Pubmed using the following search terms ((COVID-19).ti,ab OR (SARS-CoV-2).ti,ab)
AND ((vaccine).ti,ab OR (vaccination).ti,ab OR (immunisation).ti,ab)) AND ((healthcare
worker).ti,ab OR (health worker).ti,ab OR (doctor).ti,ab OR (nurse).ti,ab OR (healthcare
professional).ti,ab)) AND ((hesitancy).ti,ab OR (refusal).ti,ab OR (uptake).ti,ab)). The search returned
60 results, of which 38 were excluded after title and abstract screening, 11 studies were not conducted
in a population of healthcare workers, 20 did not present data on vaccine intention or uptake, 5 were
related to vaccines other than the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 1 was unrelated to vaccination and 1 had
been withdrawn. The 22 remaining articles were survey studies focussed on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
intention in healthcare workers. Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance varied widely from
27·7% - 94·5% depending on the country in which the study was performed, and the occupational
group studied. Only 2 studies (both conducted in the USA) had a sample size greater than 10,000.
Most studies found females, non-medical healthcare staff and those refusing influenza vaccine to be
more likely to be hesitant. There was conflicting evidence about the effects of age and previous
COVID-19 on hesitancy. Only 3 studies (all from the USA), presented data disaggregated by
ethnicity, all finding Black ethnic HCWs were most likely to be hesitant. Common themes amongst
studies that investigated reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about safety of vaccines, fear of
side effects and short development timeframes. We did not find any studies on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
hesitancy in UK healthcare workers in the published literature.

Added value of this study
This study is amongst the largest SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy studies in the literature. It is the
largest study outside the USA and is the only study in UK HCWs. Our work focusses on the
association of ethnicity with vaccine hesitancy, and we are the first study outside the USA to present
results by ethnic group. The large number of ethnic minority HCWs in our study allows for
examination of the outcome by more granular ethnicity categories than have previously been studied,
allowing us to detect important differences in vaccine hesitancy levels within the broad White and
Asian ethnic groupings. Our large sample size and the richness of our cohort study dataset allows us
to control for many potential confounders in our multivariable analysis, and provide novel data on
important potential drivers of hesitancy including discrimination, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs,
religion/religiosity and personality traits. Additionally, we combine quantitative with qualitative data
providing a deeper understanding of the drivers of hesitancy and potential strategies to improve
vaccine uptake in HCWs from ethnic minority communities.

Implications of all the available evidence
Around a quarter of UK healthcare workers reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. In accordance
with previous studies in other countries, we determined that female sex and lack of influenza vaccine
in the previous season were important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in UK HCWs,
although in contrast to most studies in the published literature, after adjustment we do not demonstrate
differences in hesitancy levels by occupational role. Importantly, previous literature provides
conflicting evidence of the effects of age and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on vaccine hesitancy.
In our study, younger HCWs and those with evidence of previous COVID-19 were more likely to be
hesitant. This study provides novel data on increased hesitancy levels within Black Caribbean, Mixed
White and Black Caribbean, Black African, Chinese, Pakistani and White Other ethnic groups.
Mistrust (of vaccines in general, in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines specifically, in healthcare systems and
research) and misinformation appear to be important drivers of hesitancy within HCWS in the UK.
Our data indicate that despite facing an increased risk of COVID-19 compared to their White
colleagues, UK HCWs from some ethnic minority groups continue to exhibit greater levels of SARSCoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. This study provides policy makers with evidence to inform strategies to
improve uptake.

Introduction
An unprecedented global research effort has resulted in effective vaccines against the causative agent
of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1,2 Emerging evidence
suggests that mass vaccination programmes, which are underway globally, can significantly reduce
the incidence of COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths.3 The UK Joint Committee on
Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) have prioritised certain high-risk groups in the UK’s
vaccination programme, including frontline health and social care staff. There are however concerns
about SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers (HCWs),4-13 and particularly among
some ethnic minority groups 14-21 including ethnic minority HCWs 22,23 despite those groups being
disproportionately affected by the pandemic.24,25
Vaccine hesitancy is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as refusal or delay in vaccine
acceptance.26 Levels of hesitancy towards specific vaccines and/or vaccines in general differ across
individuals. Vaccine hesitancy amongst HCWs is especially concerning because it increases risks to
the health of the individual HCW, is likely to increase the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2
transmission,27 and may influence patient vaccine uptake.15,28 Reasons for vaccine hesitancy vary
between individuals and by context, geographic location and vaccine, but the WHO’s “Three C’s
model” has identified three areas influencing hesitancy: Convenience (vaccine access), Confidence
(trust - in vaccines generally, in their efficacy, in those providing the vaccine, and in those creating
vaccine policy), and Complacency (perceived risk of vaccine-related disease).26,28-30
The UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) ethnicity subgroup has identified the
following key factors underlying vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minority groups: physical barriers to
access; lower trust and confidence in vaccine efficacy and safety, and general lack of trust in
healthcare and health research due to structural and institutional racism and discrimination; lower
perceived risk; and contextual factors such as gender, education, socioeconomic status and family
decision-making.15 A recent study of predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy from the UK
Household Longitudinal Study found that among vaccine hesitant groups, Black participants were
more likely to cite lack of trust in vaccines and worries about unknown future effects of vaccination,
whereas Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups were most concerned about side effects as well as
unknown future effects.16
Studies of COVID-19 vaccination intentions and uptake in HCWs since December 2020 show
variability in uptake between countries and, as with general populations, variability by occupational
and demographic groups.8,22,31,32 A study in a large UK hospital trust showed that 71% of White staff
had been vaccinated against COVID-19 as compared to 59% of South Asian staff and 37% of Black
staff. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy (other than belonging to an ethnic minority group)
were younger age, female sex and living in more deprived areas.12
To date there have been very few large-scale studies of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among
ethnically diverse HCWs. We undertook an analysis to understand levels of vaccine hesitancy and the
factors predicting this in UK HCWs using interim data from the United Kingdom Research study into
Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH), integrating survey data
from a nationwide prospective longitudinal cohort study and qualitative data from HCWs nationwide.

Methods
Overview
UK-REACH encompasses six studies to understand the impact of COVID-19 on HCWs from diverse
ethnic backgrounds. Here we present data from the baseline questionnaire of the UK-REACH
prospective cohort study (administered online from 4th December 2020 with interim data downloaded
19th February 2021), and qualitative data from UK-REACH interviews and focus groups (undertaken
from December 2020 to March 2021). Both studies took place in healthcare settings in all four nations

of the UK with clinical and non-clinical HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds; see study protocols
for methodological details.33,34

Prospective nationwide cohort study
Questionnaire design, sampling and baseline questionnaire measures are detailed in the study
protocol33 and data dictionary (https://www.uk-reach.org/data-dictionary).
Study population
All HCWs or ancillary workers in a UK healthcare setting aged 16 or over and/or those registered
with one of seven main healthcare regulatory bodies, who responded to an email invitation or who
were directly recruited through participating healthcare trusts or open links advertised on social media
or in newsletters.
Primary outcome measure
We derived the primary outcome, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy (binary measure: hesitant versus
accepting) from responses to two versions of vaccine questions (VQ1 and VQ2: see Supplementary
Figure 1 for details). Vaccine questions were updated during the recruitment/completion period to
reflect rapid inception/evolution of the vaccination programme.
Predictor variables
We selected variables for inclusion based on the vaccine hesitancy literature, in particular the WHO
“Three C’s” model and the vaccine hesitancy determinants matrix,26 as well as the UK SAGE report
on vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minority groups.15 Selected variables measured trust in vaccines and
those delivering them; perceived risk of COVID-19; access to vaccines based on job role, sector and
location; socio-demographics; and psychological factors. See Error! Reference source not found.
for variable list and the data dictionary for details of variables https://www.uk-reach.org/main/datadictionary/. We included a variable to indicate whether participants had answered VQ1 (between 4th
and 20th December 2020) or VQ2 (between 21st December 2020 and 19th February 2021). In addition,
participants whose VQ2 response indicated that they had considered or were considering not having
the vaccine were asked to indicate why they were hesitant.

Statistical analysis
We summarised categorical variables as count and percentage, and continuous variables as mean
(standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) depending on their distribution. We
compared groups (hesitant vs accepting, and ethnic groups) with chi-squared tests for categorical
variables, and t-tests and analyses of variance for continuous measures, with non-parametric
equivalents used as appropriate. Due to the number of tests being performed we considered
associations statistically significant at p≤0·001. We checked 2 x 2 interactions with ethnicity on a
complete case analysis, which did not significantly improve the model fit.
We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to determine unadjusted and adjusted
associations of variables described above with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy.
We used multiple imputation (MI) to replace missing data in all logistic regression models using the
package mice (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) v3·13·0 in R version 4·0·4, using predictive
mean matching (pmm) for all variables, with 20 imputations and five iterations per imputation (See
Supplementary Table 1).

Qualitative data and analysis
Study population
Clinical and non-clinical HCWs aged 16 or older from ethnic minority and White backgrounds with
experience of working in UK healthcare settings during COVID-19, recruited through study partners,
community organisations, and NHS organisations across the UK.

Data analysis
We used framework analysis to analyse anonymised transcripts from interviews and focus groups, and
free text data from the cohort study. In interviews and focus groups, we collected data using a piloted
topic guide exploring experiences of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, fears and concerns,
stigma, discrimination, racism, views on the COVID-19 vaccine, challenges participants encountered
in accessing information, and their perceived risk. We collected data on participant gender, ethnicity,
age, country of birth, and job role. From the cohort study, free text data were included for participants
who discussed SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in response to the following three questions : “What are
your thoughts on why people from ethnic minorities working in health and care have been more
severely affected by COVID-19?”, “How do you see society changing as a result of COVID-19?” and
“How do you see your own future changing as a result of COVID-19?”35
We developed the initial framework based on a preliminary analysis of the data and the WHO
framework for behavioural considerations for acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines.36 We
piloted the framework with the first five transcripts, and refined it iteratively during analysis. The
framework encompasses “Drivers of vaccine hesitancy” relating to “health information and
messaging”, “Motivation” utilising the ‘Three Cs Model’, and “Improving delivery”.

Ethical approval
Both studies were approved by the Health Research Authority (Brighton and Sussex Research Ethics
Committee; ethics reference: 20/HRA/4718). All participants gave written informed consent.

Involvement and engagement
We worked closely with a Professional Expert Panel of HCWs from a range of ethnic backgrounds,
occupations, and genders, as well as with national and local organisations (see study protocols).33,34

Results
Prospective nationwide cohort study
Description of analysed cohort
Between 4th December 2020 and 19th February 2021, professional regulators sent 1,052,875 HCWs
email invitations with a link to the questionnaire, and 21 National Health Service (NHS) Hospital
Trusts publicised the questionnaire to their staff and invited staff by email. As of 19th February 2021,
15,151 participants had started the questionnaire. The analysed interim cohort were formed of 11,584
participants who both completed the questionnaire and answered the question about their sex. See
Table 1 for the cohort demographics, job type and location.
Univariable results
Table 1 shows the cohort stratified by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy; Table 2 shows univariable
relationships between hesitancy and vaccine-related trust and perceived risk of COVID-19. Briefly,
just under a quarter of participants (2694/11,584; 23·3%) were vaccine hesitant. Over half (51·0%) of
Black Caribbean, 38·1% of Mixed White and Black Caribbean, 34·4% of Black African, 32·4% of
Chinese, 29·8% of Pakistani, and 28·7% of the White Other1 group were vaccine hesitant, compared
to 21·0% of White British, 19·6% of Indian and 18·8% of Bangladeshi HCWs. The least hesitant
occupational group was the Doctors and medical support group (18·4% hesitant) and the most hesitant
was the Nursing, Nursing associates and Midwives group (28·2% hesitant).
Error! Reference source not found.Hesitant participants scored higher on the ‘COVID-19
conspiracy beliefs’ scale (median hesitant: 10, IQR: 8-11; non-hesitant: 8, 7-10 p<0·0001), were less
confident their employer would address a concern about unsafe clinical practice (63·3% vs 73·3%

The ‘White Other’ group includes the ‘White Other’ and ‘White Gypsy and Irish Traveller’
categories, because there were very small numbers in the latter group.

Reasons for hesitancy
Among those who reported reasons for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy, the White group (White
British, White Irish, White Other and White Gypsy/Irish Traveller) were less concerned than other
ethnic groups about potential vaccine side effects or about the vaccine not having been tested in
diverse ethnic groups, and they were less likely to want to delay until others had the vaccine. Reasons
for hesitancy overall and by broad ethnic grouping are given in Error! Reference source not found..
Multivariable results
Demographic predictors of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy
Table 3 shows univariable and multivariable logistic regression models with an outcome of SARSCoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. After adjusting for socio-demographic, job, trust, perceived COVID-19
risk, and psychological factors, vaccine hesitancy was less likely with increasing age (aOR 0·74
95%CI 0·70–0·78 for each decade increase) and more likely among female HCWs (aOR 1·42 95%CI
1·24–1·62). Compared to White British HCWs, those from Black Caribbean (aOR 3·37 95%CI 2·11–
5·37), Black African (aOR 2·05, 95%CI 1·49–2·82), and White Other (aOR 1·48 95%CI 1·19–1·84)
ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be vaccine hesitant.
Trust, COVID-19 risk and psychological predictors of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and
refusal
Greater belief in COVID-19 conspiracies was significantly associated with increased odds of
hesitancy (aOR 1·12, 95%CI 1·08–1·16 for each 1 point increase on the scale). Increasing confidence
that concerns raised about unsafe practice would be addressed by their employer decreased the odds
of hesitancy (aOR 0·87, 95%CI 0·82 - 0·93). Those who had received the influenza vaccine in winter
2019/2020 were around half as likely to be SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitant compared to those who had
not (aOR 0·51, 95%CI 0·46 - 0·57). HCWs who reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR or
serology, were significantly more likely to be hesitant than those testing negative (aOR 1·30, 95%CI
1·14 - 1·47). Pregnant HCWs were over 7 times as likely to be hesitant (aOR 7·12, 95%CI 4·74 10·70).

Qualitative study
Description of sample
We included 99 individuals, 41 recruited through interviews (n=24) and focus groups (n=17) , and 58
from the longitudinal cohort study (free text comments provided about vaccinations). Among the 41
qualitative participants, 13 were Asian (32%), 12 were Black (29%), and 10 were White (24%). 27
(66%) were women, and 24 were born in the UK (59%). 18 participants were allied health
professionals, pharmacists, and dentists (44%), whilst 9 were doctors (22%), 3 were nurses or
midwives (7%), and 11 were non-clinical (27%). Among the 58 cohort participants, 42 were White
(72%), 8 were Asian (14%), and 4 were Black (7%). 48 participants (83%) were women, and 44
(76%) were born in the UK. 26 (45%) of participants were allied health professionals, pharmacists, or
dentists, 7 were doctors (12%), whilst 23 (40%) were nurses or midwives.
Drivers of vaccine hesitancy
We identified four intersecting themes describing key drivers of and ways to address vaccine
hesitancy among HCWs: Trust, Perceived risk, Health information and messaging, and Improving
delivery (See Figure 1; Error! Reference source not found.-8 for quotes).

Trust
Participants described their enthusiasm about the vaccine, appreciation of being prioritised, and the
role of trust in colleagues, the NHS, and health information in facilitating vaccine uptake. Narratives
also highlighted the influence of experiences of discrimination and structural inequities on trust and
vaccine hesitancy, and the ubiquity of concerns around the vaccine across both those who declined to
be vaccinated and those who described themselves as pro-vaccine.
Trust in vaccinations
Whilst some participants described a lack of confidence in vaccines generally, most participants
described being accepting of routine or flu vaccinations. Key concerns for the COVID-19 vaccine
related to speed of development, lack of longitudinal data, and potential side effects, as well as
efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. There were also concerns about the underrepresentation of
individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in vaccine trials.
Trust in those producing, giving, and taking vaccines
Vaccine confidence among colleagues, family, friends and community members increased HCW trust
in the vaccine. More senior colleagues - particularly clinicians - were especially influential, and
conversely trust was eroded when they did not adhere to guidance. Some participants described a
contradiction between their own concerns around having the vaccine, yet promoting it for the wider
public through their roles.
Perceived risks of COVID-19 to self and others
Whilst some participants felt at low risk, others expressed concern about the risk of exposure in their
role and fears of having COVID-19, even if they did not have other key risk factors. Previous
infection, knowing people who had been unwell or passed away from COVID-19, and concerns about
infection of their families and loved ones often increased perceived risk. Participants’ views about the
extent to which vaccination could reduce risk also influenced their decision to be vaccinated, as did
their desire to reduce their risk of transmission and protect their close contacts. Participants also
discussed how they perceived ethnicity to influence risk. Whilst prioritisation of NHS workers for
vaccines was welcomed, some felt ethnic minority groups should have been prioritised given their
increased risk.
Health information and messaging
Accessibility and trustworthiness of health information shaped vaccine concerns. Complex
information, conflicting and changing guidance, overwhelming amounts of material, and poor
provision of information in other languages contributed to a lack of trust, confusion, and ultimately
vaccine hesitancy. Participants also noted the stigma around vaccine hesitancy and lack of vaccine
knowledge.
Participants obtained information from numerous sources. Social media was often described as
potentially misleading or unreliable, but some participants acknowledged its usefulness for raising
awareness, vaccine promotion, and disseminating messaging, especially as information shared by
community members may be more trusted. Participants also frequently accessed information through
the news, or Government and NHS sources. However, the positive presentation of vaccines by these
sources was felt by some to be insincere with potential risks not being transparently communicated.
This fed into suspicions around official reports on COVID-19 further contributing to HCW mistrust.
There were varying responses to the focus on ethnic minorities. While prioritisation of NHS workers
for vaccines was welcomed, some felt HCWs from ethnic minority backgrounds should have been
further prioritised given evidence of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on these communities.
The narratives also illustrated discomfort with the focus on ethnic minorities in the media, messaging
and vaccine promotion campaigns, which singled out these communities as ‘vaccine hesitant’ and
increased stigma. One participant brought attention to discourse around reported low vaccine uptake

of the vaccine among Black doctors, calling for greater transparency and accuracy around uptake
rates, and better understandings of the factors that inform decisions about vaccines.
Inclusive communication
Participants highlighted the value of communicating messages through a range of media and
languages, and engaging directly with people to respond to questions or concerns, and tackle
misinformation. Participants also advocated for using existing resources such as multilinguistic
healthcare staff to strengthen the accessibility and trustworthiness of health information.
Participants also described the importance of language in how groups are described, and the need to
avoid assumptions or stereotyping associated with ethnicity. This was important for creating more
inclusive communication around how at-risk groups - and ethnic minority communities in particular are described in research, the workplace, and the media.
Increasing transparency and trust
Trust and informed decision-making about vaccines was influenced by how risk groups were
identified and prioritised, who was eligible, and the perceived risks and benefits. Participants
explained the importance of transparent and clear communication through hospital Trusts.
Equity, opportunity and mandatory vaccination
Participants underscored the need to ensure equity in vaccine delivery, with some advocating
prioritisation of staff experiencing the greatest barriers to getting the vaccine, or who were at greatest
risk. Whilst some participants advocated for “mandatory vaccinations for those choosing to work in
health and social care settings” (Participant 84, Speech and language therapist), others were
concerned about the potential lack of equity for those who chose not to have the vaccine, and that
mandating vaccination could create further ethnic divides between communities and increase stigma
and discrimination. Participants also discussed how ensuring equity in accessibility and opportunity to
have the vaccine would be paramount for improving delivery.
Outreach through involvement
Participants described how the vaccine roll-out could be improved through better engagement with
and involvement of HCWs, particularly those from ethnic minority communities. The narratives
pointed to the lack of inclusion of marginalised communities throughout the pandemic, and the
potential benefit of increasing visibility of less well represented groups in the media to promote
vaccine uptake and trust.
Participants also discussed the importance of promoting vaccination through trusted networks, and the
value of more proactive involvement and engagement of healthcare workers from diverse ethnic
backgrounds. An important aspect of both building trust and increasing accessibility was
acknowledging cultural differences in understandings of and access to vaccines. Participants
highlighted how the involvement of minoritised communities can play an important role in bridging
cultural divides, and the potential benefit of outreach activities for addressing logistical challenges in
delivering the vaccine.

Discussion
In this analysis of interim data from nearly 12,000 HCWs across the UK, approximately a quarter of
participants reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy. HCWs from Black Caribbean, Black African
and White Other ethnic groups reported higher hesitancy than those from the White British group
after adjusting for other predictors. Additional factors predicting hesitancy were scoring higher on the
COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, pregnancy, and previous COVID-19
infection. Qualitative data showed information and messaging influenced vaccine concerns. Speed of
vaccine development, experiences of discrimination and structural inequalities also contributed to a
lack of trust in the vaccine.

Our finding of 23% of UK HCWs being SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitant is in keeping with a recent
systematic review of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, which found an average acceptance of 57% (range
28%-78%) across countries and occupation groups.8 Many smaller SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy
studies have been conducted outside the UK with common predictors of vaccine hesitancy being
female sex, non-medical occupation, lack of influenza vaccination and lower perceived risk of
COVID-19.6,7,37-39 There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of age and previous COVID-19
on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy.37,40-42 Importantly, only two studies, both conducted in the US,
examined the impact of ethnicity on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy after adjustment for
confounders, with both finding that Black ethnic groups were more likely to be hesitant compared to
White HCWs.41,42 Whilst data on vaccine hesitancy in UK HCWs are limited, recent work examining
vaccine uptake amongst hospital staff in the UK found that 35·5% of HCWs had not been vaccinated;
vaccination rates were highest amongst White HCWs and, in-line with our findings, lowest among
Black ethnic groups.12
Due to the novel nature of COVID-19, the evidence base for barriers to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in
ethnic minority communities is limited. However, UK’s SAGE ethnicity subgroup identified barriers
to vaccine uptake amongst ethnic minority groups including lower trust in vaccine efficacy/safety
(particularly speed of vaccine development), mistrust of healthcare organisations (due to prior
unethical research practices), lack of representation in vaccine trials, and institutional racism and
discrimination.30 Our study provides evidence that these same factors may influence vaccine hesitancy
in HCWs. Many of these themes emerged in our qualitative data, with HCWs describing reservations
about accepting vaccination rooted in safety concerns due to the short development timeframe of
current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Experiences of health inequities and knowledge of historic unethical
health and research practices were cited by some Black HCWs as influencing their mistrust of the
NHS. This overarching mistrust in the organisation was also reflected in attitudes towards SARSCoV-2 vaccination with a perception of low ethnic minority involvement in trials to gauge vaccine
safety/efficacy, and the lack of prioritisation within the vaccination rollout despite evidence of the
disproportionate impact on the health of those from minority ethnic backgrounds. Additionally, in
data from the cohort study, lower trust in employer was found to predict hesitancy, and high
proportions of vaccine hesitant ethnic minority HCWs expressed concerns regarding vaccine safety
and about a lack of testing in all ethnic groups.
These results have important implications for public health measures aimed at improving vaccine
uptake. It has been reported that mandatory SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is being considered for care
home staff in the UK,43 and the Italian government has mandated vaccination in HCWs (with those
that refuse offered duties that do not risk viral transmission or suspension without pay).44 Whilst these
measures may improve vaccine uptake, our results indicate that implementing these policies may
undermine trust (both in the employing healthcare organisations and in the vaccination programme).45
Given that this effect would not be seen equally across ethnic groups, such interventions have the
potential to increase stigma and discrimination and widen ethnic disparities.
We found that higher scores on the COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale was associated with vaccine
hesitancy, and this was also more likely in ethnic minority groups as compared to those of White
ethnicity. To our knowledge, we are the first to show this effect in a HCW population. A general
population survey in the UK found that belief in COVID-19 conspiracies was more likely in those
who were SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitant and in ethnic minority groups.46 Our findings confirm that
misinformation relating to COVID-19 is important even amongst HCWs, and strategies to tackle this
may increase vaccination uptake amongst HCWs and the population at large.
We found that those with evidence of previous COVID-19 were more likely to be vaccine hesitant
than those who tested negative by PCR/serology.12 This may reflect HCWs with evidence of previous
SARS-CoV-2 infection feeling they have derived sufficient immunological protection against

COVID-19 via natural infection and will therefore derive limited benefit from vaccination. Whilst this
is likely to be true in a short period following the infective episode, over time, reinfection is possible.
Population level data from Denmark indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 offers 80·5%
protection against reinfection, dropping to 47·1% in those over 65.47 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2
neutralising antibody dynamics in those recovered from COVID-19 have been shown to vary
widely,48 and protective immunity to related seasonal coronaviruses is known to be short-lasting.49,50
Therefore, HCWs with evidence of previous COVID-19 (particularly those who were infected many
months previously) represent important targets for vaccination, and publicising this message in
communications aimed at HCWs may improve uptake in this group.
This is the largest study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine attitudes in a multi-ethnic sample of UK HCWs at
the start of a vaccine roll-out. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data provides an indepth understanding of hesitancy among different ethnic groups. Despite these strengths, our study
also has a number of limitations including the potential for self-selection bias and the low number of
ancillary staff in the sample. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the vaccination programme,
questions relating to vaccination were changed midway through the baseline questionnaire rollout
which could have impacted on outcome, although we have controlled for questionnaire version in the
multivariable analysis. The relevant sections of the baseline questionnaire were not designed to
capture actual vaccine uptake as an outcome but rather attitudes towards vaccination and thus we
cannot determine whether access to vaccination could be a driver in vaccine hesitancy in our sample,
however this will be captured in follow-up questionnaires.
In summary, we have identified key predictors of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy in HCWs and
demonstrate clear ethnic differences in hesitancy levels. Importantly, we have established drivers
behind vaccine hesitancy in HCWs, which include belief in COVID-19 conspiracies and mistrust (of
vaccines in general, in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines specifically, in healthcare systems and research) and
suggest that these factors may account for some of the observed ethnic differences in hesitancy.
Strategies to improve vaccine confidence are urgently required to prevent these ethnic disparities from
widening. Such strategies may include building trust and involvement/engagement of ethnic minority
HCWs in the vaccination rollout, promoting vaccination and overcoming misinformation utilising
trusted networks in ethnic minority communities.
