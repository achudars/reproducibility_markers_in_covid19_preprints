ABSTRACT
Objectives
In this study, a comparative study between primers from Japan’s and US’s disease control
centers was conducted. As further investigation, virus sequence alignment with primers’
oligonucleotide was analyzed.
Design or methods
11,652 samples from Japanese population were tested for SARS-CoV-2 positive using
recommended RT-PCR primer-probe sets from Japan National Institute of Infectious
Disease (NIID) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Results
Of the 102 positive samples, 17 samples (16.7% of total positives) showed inconsistent
results when tested simultaneously for the following primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1,
CDC-N1, and CDC-N2. As a result, CDC recommended primer-probe sets showed
relatively higher sensitivity and accuracy. Further virus sequence alignment analysis
showed evidences for virus mutation happening at primer’s binding sites.

Conclusions
The inconsistency in the RT-PCR results for JPN-N1, JPN-N2, CDC-N1, and CDC-N2
primer-probe sets could be attributed to differences in virus mutation at primers’ binding
site as observed in sequence analysis. The use of JPN-N2 combined with CDC-N2 primer
produces the most effective result to reduce false negatives in Japan region. In addition,
adding CDC-N1 will also help to detect false negatives.

INTRODUCTION
The global COVID-19 pandemic has spread across various continents in diverse methods
and speed while opening up discussion for technological and scientific questions
pertaining methodology of testing accuracy among diverse viral strains.
On the issue of testing sensitivity and accuracy, RT-PCR has been the gold standard
testing method for SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to other rapid testing methods (Corman et al.
2020; Wu et al. 2020). However, each country’s infectious disease authority has
established its own primer-probe sets guidelines and protocols, thereby, the global testing
community lacks a “Standardized Universal Primer(s)” (SUP) that is foolproof for the
COVID-19 patients among various populations today. As a result, RT-PCR testing
accuracy and results may vary depending on which primer was used, most likely resulting
in false negative and/or false positive calls associated with RT-PCR testing.
There are two commonly known factors associated with inaccurate testing results for
COVID-19 using RT-PCR testing. First is the failure to retrieve sufficient amounts of
viral RNA typically associated with the timing of when the sample is administered or the
method of how a sample is collected. For example, a nasopharyngeal swab may be unable
to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA if it does not come in contact at a nasal position
where the presence of the virus is concentrated. In the case of saliva collection kit, use
during the first several days of viral contact may result in insufficient amounts of RNA.

For both nasopharyngeal swab and saliva kit, low amounts of RNA occurring at later
stage among discharged or recovering patients has tendency to show extremely low RNA
count. While many countries have issued a standard 14-day quarantine, Genesis
Healthcare, a licensed clinical laboratory in Tokyo, Japan, has confirmed through tested
samples where the recovering and discharged patient is still testing positive after 14 day
despite low RNA count. Though this confirmation does not necessarily imply that the
patient is infectious after 14 days of quarantine as observed in a study (Cheng et al. 2020),
while the test result remains positive, it supports recent study which outlines the long
duration of the RNA-positive tail and calls for reconsideration of containment strategy
(Mina et al. 2020).
The second factor is the lack of a standardized international testing method for
COVID-19 using a set of common primer(s) among different nations/populations or
hereby referred to as SUP. Different primers used by different country’s testing protocols
prevent effective tracking of pandemic due to differences in false positives and/or false
negative results due to viral genetic variation which may have been introduced from
different regions.
Researchers has started to recognize this problem as more data about the viral genomes
become available. In particular, a researcher group evaluated five assay panels for
possible loss of sensitivity due to genetic variability of the virus (Peñarrubia et al. 2020).
Their conclusion was in accordance with what has been observed in our study.
In this paper, the RT-PCR result discrepancy for SARS-CoV-2 testing is summarized and
compared among different primers recommended by NIID and CDC. Further, virus
mutation as a plausible cause of discrepancy is investigated and discussed.
METHODS
Study Design:
Japan’s COVID-19 RT-PCR public health observation is unique in that while Wuhan,
China was locked down from January 23, 2020 till April 8th, 2020, Japan’s border was
still open to remainder of China until March 9th, 2020 and to US and Europe until March
26, 2020. This time gap in closing the international border leaves an inquiry that
COVID-19 could have possibility entered Japan at different times from both East and
West.

Figure 2. A RT-PCR results for JPN-N2 and JPN-N1 primer-probe sets: JPN-N2 shows relatively
higher signal intensity compared to JPN-N1 and the rising curve starts at 25 cycles
for SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.

JPN-N2 has seen consistently higher primer sensitivity than JPN-N1. As a result, it is
sought that NIID later eliminated JPN-N1 to only reflect JPN-N2 in calling positive
samples.
Due to the continuing dialogue by the medical community to retest samples whose results
were not considered to reflect patient’s symptoms, testing JPN-N1 was continued and
CDC-N1 and CDC-N2, both of which are located in nucleocapsid region N of
SARS-CoV-2, were added to identify whether JPN-N2 primer was adequate to identify
COVID-19 positive cases for all samples.

including Japan’s Center of Infectious Disease Testing Protocol
(Primers: JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N2, CDC-N1).

Sample Collection:
All COVID-19 positive testing samples were obtained between April, 2020 and August,
2020 and were either obtained from saliva or nasopharyngeal test kits. The
nasopharyngeal testing included two swabs per person and were administered to
maximize virus collection to rule out miscalling due to low RNA count. Both
nasopharyngeal and saliva samples were immediately immersed in RNA preservation
solution after extraction to inactivate the virus while maintaining RNA stability during
transport. Samples were delivered to the Genesis Healthcare’s PCR testing facility within
24 hours at temperatures between 20° and 27° Celsius. All samples’ RNA extraction was
immediately conducted followed by RT-PCR test. The entire RNA extraction to RT-PCR
testing process was completed within 6 hours of receipt at the same laboratory using the
below testing method.
COVID-19 RNA Collection Method, Extraction and RT-PCR Testing Method:
Saliva samples were collected using saliva RNA sample collection kit by Zeesan Biotech
Co., Ltd. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected using virus RNA sample
collection kit by Zeesan Biotech Co., Ltd. Saliva samples were added 0.5 ml 20% DTT to
remove viscosity, vortex and incubate at 50° Celsius for 10 minutes, then centrifuged at
1,500 rpm for 10 minutes.

180 μl of supernatant of DTT-treatment saliva samples and 180 μl of nasopharyngeal
swab suspension were used for RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed by
MGISP-960 system (MGI Tech Co., Ltd). RT-qPCR for specific amplification of the
N gene or E gene of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using LightCycler480 systemⅡ(Roche
Diagnostics K.K.). Final reaction volume was 12.5 μl, including 2.0 μl of RNA
template, 6.25 μl of One Step PrimeScript III RT-qPCR Mix (TAKARA BIO INC.) , and
forward primer, reverse primer and probe (primer and probe sequence, final
concentration was shown in Table 1.
The cycling conditions consisted of RT at 50° Celsius for 5 minutes, initial denaturation
at 95° Celsius for 10 sec, and 45 cycles of denaturation at 95° Celsius for 5 seconds and
annealing/extension at 60° Celsius for 30 seconds.
RESULTS
All samples were tested simultaneously for JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N2, and CDC-N1
primer/probe set (Note: As of May, 2020, the Japanese testing protocol for COVID-19 is
only JPN-N2 as announced by the Japan’s NIID).

Table 3. Breakdown of JPN-N2 negative samples having positive response from CDC-N1
and/or CDC-N2.

However, Table 3 depicts that among the 17 samples which were tested negative for
JPN-N2, 12 samples were tested positive for CDC-N2 primer/probe set while negative for
CDC-N1, 4 samples tested positive for both CDC-N1 and CDC-N2. Furthermore, one
sample was tested positive for CDC-N1 while negative for CDC-N2 (Figure 3-5).
These 17 “test result irregularities”, which accounts for 16.7% of total 102 positive
sample pool would be declared negative if a laboratory only tested JPN-N2. This high
rate of irregular occurrence stemming from 1 primer/probe can be considered as one of
the major causes leading to false negatives that are often reported in association with
COVID-19 testing accuracy. Furthermore, from the observation above, a combination of
multiple primers, in this case, a combination of JPN-N2 and CDC-N2 primer shows the
highest rate of accuracy and sensitivity compared to JPN-N2 primer alone, followed by a
triple combination of JPN-N-2, CDC-N2 and CDC-N1 for the Japanese population.
These combinations, however, may change with various COVID-19 strains that could
exist in other populations and further investigation is necessary to identify the optimum
combination of primers for the Japanese population as cross-border travel brings different
COVID-19 strains that react to different primers.
Sample Observation of RT-PCR Data of Irregular Samples:
Below are several examples of unique and irregular samples and its RT-PCR data that
could serve as future hypothesis for identifying and detecting the causes of false testing
results.

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208264; this version posted January 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this

In the first case, samples reacted only to the CDC-N2 primer but not to the JPN primers.
One of the most problematic cases observed are the samples whereby JPN-N2 primer
resulted in negative albeit responding positive to CDC-N2 or CDC-N1 primers. Since
Japanese testing protocol for COVID-19 is JPN-N2 alone, registered Japanese clinical
laboratories are expected to call based on N2 primer result. However, in instances such as
these, the importance to provide additional information regarding the test result for CDC
is recognized and attending physicians are strongly urged to retest the patient again via
RT-PCR or utilize other testing methods such as CT Scan and antigen. This would
diminish the risk of misinformation and potentially spread of the infection to others for
patients, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic.

Figure 4. A Japanese sample that was negative for JPN-N2 and CDC-N1 but positive for CDC-N2.

Among the 4 primers and probe, only CDC-N2 reacted as positive response at late cycle
(40x). This patient (male patient A) became symptomatic 14 days before testing and
upon taking PCR test on day 5, tested positive. After 1 week of quarantine and the
public health office has lifted his self-quarantine, he voluntarily retested to reconfirm
his status. His results showed that his test result would be negative under Japan NIID’s
JPN-N2 standalone testing protocol, but the results clearly identified that he is still
positive on CDC-N2 and would be declared positive if this person were to be tested at a
laboratory in the US, where CDC-N2 is the standard protocol.

both showed positive responses at later cycles than JPN-N2 positive control (36.54
cycles and 37.44 respectively).

DISCUSSION
There are numerous factors that could affect RT-PCR result discrepancy, ranging from
sample collection method, collection timing, virus inactivation technique, and many other
RT-PCR procedures. However, given that the testing protocol strictly follows NIID and
CDC testing guideline and protocol, that left viral diversity as a strong candidate for the
irregularities.
It’s hypothesized that various virus strains align differently to different primers used
globally due to its unique sequence. Specifically, at the time of analysis, there are 15,745
SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to NCBI GenBank (Sayers et al. 2020) where each
sequence contains different combination of variants/mutations. Therefore, to further
validate our assumption, the virus mutation data and primers oligonucleotide sequences
are investigated.

Primers vs. Viral Genetic Variations:
In an effort to try to explore the primer(s) effectiveness in current virus variations, an
exploratory data analysis has been conducted over 84 virus strains from Japan, retrieved
from NCBI GenBank genetic sequence database as of August 28, 2020.
From extracted Japan’s samples, a phylogeny tree was generated using tool from NCBI
Virus (Hatcher et al. 2017). The resulting tree shows different clades connected in
hierarchies, suggesting that there are different virus mutations in the geographical region.
Next, a sequence alignment using primers nucleotide from different countries against all
coronavirus 2 strains from Japan was performed, using Blastn. The alignment results are
then filtered to contain only perfect consecutive alignment of all nucleotides, meaning
identities must be exactly equal to the length of primer oligonucleotide sequence with no
gap. With such a rigid filter, the number of alignment matches were visualized using
iTOL (Letunic and Bork 2019) and many virus strains those do not match with some
primers are found as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10. 84 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identified for Japanese COVID samples with primers
locations where false negatives will most likely occur.

The finding also coincides with other study (Osório and Correia-Neves 2020) reporting
that of 33 oligonucleotides developed by different centers and shared by WHO, 79% (26)

has at least one genome mutation at the primer binding sites from GISAID database
containing 1,825 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
While one dominant strain will test positive for a specific primer, there are irregularities
that will not display positive for another primer, most likely resulting in false negative
calls. In this respect, laboratories should examine their primers against all known viral
genome sequences to ensure that the selected primers will not result in inaccurate calling.
CONCLUSION
The conflicting positive/negative results from the same samples that occur among
different primers (JPN-N2, JPN-N1, CDC-N2, CDC-N1) outline 1) the possibility of
high occurrences of false negative testing results by laboratories where JPN-N2 is the
only primer used for SARS-CoV-2, and 2) the probability that false negative/positive
will likely occur when the primer binding site lies in the virus mutated location for
JPN-N2 and CDC-N2.
This initial observation also suggests testing CDC-N2 in addition to JPN-2 primer,
especially for symptomatic patients, with the objective to reduce false negatives and
increase accuracy. Lastly, the inclusivity of CDC-N1 will result further in reducing false
negatives but using CDC-N1 alone may also result in false positive calling and therefore
should not be used without either JPN-N2 or CDC-N2.
Further investigation by sequencing these irregular samples will identify which primers
react to different strains of the virus existing among different populations. Secondly,
these irregularities raise the need for the international testing community to explore a
standardized universal primer-probe sets combination for more accurate RT-PCR-based
COVID-19 testing, which shall help to detect different virus strain’s reaction to selected
primers by each country’s testing protocol. This is a critical consideration to ensure
accurate diagnostic testing results entailing public health and safety. While more
countries are re-opening their borders and resuming international travel to sustain the
economic growth, this may also lead to the introduction of new strains to different
populations furthering the demand for SUP.
