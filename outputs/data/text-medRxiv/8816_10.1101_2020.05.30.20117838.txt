Abstract
Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic is currently ongoing. Presently, due to the
unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, it’s essential to understand its
transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study
aims to study this context using mathematical modelling.
Methods: A COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic
reproduction number (

It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals,
and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly
reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A
sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases
to

which increases rapidly

with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the
largest contribution to infection transmission (

the contaminated environment

also played a significant role.
Conclusions: It is crucial to identify the individuals exposed and infected to COVID-19
disease and isolate them to control its transmission. The awareness of the role of fomites in
infection transmission is also important in this regard.

1. Introduction
During a viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, the first case of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) was reported in December 2019 [1,2]. The causative agent Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), an enveloped single-stranded RNA
virus, has a zoonotic origin [2,3]. Similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in
2012, the symptoms of this infection include dry cough, fatigue, breathing difficulty, and
bilateral lung infiltration [3]. In April 2020, Centre for Disease Control (CDC) suggested six
additional symptoms of COVID-19: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain,
headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell [4–6].
Since its onset, the disease has been spreading at a very fast pace to different parts of the
globe. As of 24 January 2020, 830 confirmed cases had been diagnosed in China, Thailand,
Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States [7].
Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared this epidemic as a
Global Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 [3]. The
global confirmed case of COVID-19 rose to 266073, with 11184 deaths, as on 22 March
2020 [8].
India reported its first case of COVID-19 on 30th January 2020 [9]. It was found in a
Kerala based student who was studying at Wuhan University, China [9]. Soon the disease
spread to its other parts and by 22 March 2020, WHO confirmed 360 positive COVID-19
cases across India.[8] Subsequently, on 24th March 2020, a nationwide lockdown was

imposed in in India to reduce the pace of COVID-19 spread [10]. Maharashtra is the most
affected Indian state which reported 14541 confirm cases including 583 deaths and 2465
recovery as on 4 May 2020 [11,12].
As there is no effective therapeutics or licensed vaccine to combat novel COVID-19,
it adds challenges to its control [3,13]. Moreover, as the infected individuals remain
asymptomatic during its incubation period (2-14 days), they might keep spreading the disease
unknowingly to those in their surroundings [3]. While it is important to test for COVID-19
cases, India is unable to test most of its individuals for new coronavirus cases due to lack of
enough test kits, and testing is done in those with symptoms [14]. The nation is combating the
disease by tracing people who might have had contact with COVID-19 detected individuals
based on their verbal autopsy, and by quarantining them [14]. But, due to the plausible risk of
recall bias, some contacts will always remain undetected during such contact tracing
exercises. These undetected cases pose a risk of COVID-19 transmission to the community
where they live in; therefore, it is crucial to study their role in disease transmission.
Several, research papers published in 2020 have tried to understand the transmission
dynamics of this disease by mathematical modelling. Most of these mathematical models
studied the disease risk via direct human-to-human transmission route. Choi & Ki [1] framed
a susceptible-exposed-infected-hospitalized-recovered (SEIHR) model and calculate the basic
reproduction number as 4.028 (95% CI: 4.010,4.046) using the reported number of confirmed
cases from January 20, 2020, and March 4, 2020, in Korea. Yang & Wang [3] developed a
mathematical model considering the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir
and its role in disease transmission. In this model, they approximated the overall disease risk

 4: 25 with



 1: 497 (the infection risk caused by the environmental reservoir of

the pathogen), showing a significant contribution from the environmental reservoir toward
the overall infection risk. Mandal et al. [13] framed an SEIR model with an objective to

prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks in India through restrictions on travel from COVID-19
affected countries. Read et al. [15] reported the basic reproduction number as 3.11 by fitting
data of a deterministic SEIR metapopulation transmission model. Li et al. [16] analyzed data
on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and reported the mean incubation period as 5.2
days and the basic reproduction number as 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). Despite these modelling
efforts, the role of undetected cases on the risk of infection spreading in the community
remains underexplored.
Therefore, this paper aims to study this under-explored area of COVID-19 infection
by mathematical modelling, assuming the disease acquiring potential of susceptible
individuals with contact to this virus-infected asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals,
and virus-contaminated fomites.

susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected detected ( ), infected undetected ( ), and
recovered (R). Individuals in the exposed class are asymptomatic infected, but they
are capable to spread the disease. People in the both the infected classes (detected and

4. Numerical results
Here, this model is applied to estimate the basic reproduction number using the
COVID-19 outbreak data published by WHO and the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, India for the epidemic period between March 22 and May 4, 2020 for the
Indian state of Maharashtra [8,11,12]. The data provides the daily confirm cases,
recoveries, and the total death caused by COVID-19.
Since the city was in complete lockdown during this period, its population
influx rate was expected to be equal to its birth rate, which was estimated at 5603/day
[17]. The total population of Maharashtra (N) is 112374333 [18]. As of 22-March
2020, the total confirmed coronavirus cases were 69 including 2 death and 0
recoveries, but these counts rose to 14541, 583, and 2465 respectively on 4th May
2020

[11,12]. Therefore,

"0#  112374264.

Again, as both the exposed and

undetected infected persons tend to live in the society, as usual, they transmit the
disease at the same rate, the values of these two parameters  and   were taken as
equal to

0.25 . 0.1231 . 10

estimated recovery rate



(according to Shaikh et al., 2020) [19]. Also, the

")) extracted from the data is 0.012 per day. Moreover, the

COVID-19 affected family members can survive in the environment from a few hours
to several days [3], we considered this value 5 hours in this study and therefore, the
virus removal rate (%) is

0.2/day.

We provided the value of the parameters and its

sources in Table 1.
Using the above-mentioned values of the parameters, the basic reproduction
number was estimated as

Next, regarding the impact of undetected cases on the disease risk, table 2
shows a sharp increase in the disease risk with a rise in this number.
5. Discussion
This study found a significant contribution of undetected COVID-19 cases to
the transmission risk of the disease (



 0.323). The sensitivity analysis (provided

in table 2) showed a rapid increase in the disease risk with the rise in this factor. Also,
the highest rate of infection spreading is caused by the exposed individuals ((





2.42)), establishing the fact that as the exposed individuals remain asymptomatic in
the incubation period of 2-14 days, they can easily transmit the disease unknowingly
to the other people in their surroundings. Furthermore, the contaminated environment
also contributes to the overall disease risk.
Next, the conceivable implications of this study are specified here. At the
current time, when the pandemic claims billions of lives globally with no signs of
slowing down due to non-availability of vaccine or definitive treatment, the findings
of this study may help in detecting better preventive health policy initiatives in terms
of decreasing the speed of social transmission. In this regard, the presently proposed
actions like social distancing and the implementation of lockdown appear to be
justified to curb the pace of disease transmission. Besides, this model hints, the
environmental components like fomites might have some role in disease transmission,
therefore, the use of personal protective equipment, like masks, gloves, hand sanitizer
seems to be essential.
Regarding the strengths of this paper, this is perhaps the first study on
COVID-19 that explored the role of positive non-detected cases on disease
transmission in the community, using a mathematical model. Furthermore, the use of
recent outbreak data makes the results of this study relevant to the current pandemic

scenario. Also, the inclusion of the environment as a component of the mathematical
model helps to understand the agent, host, and environment relationship of COVID19 better.
Despite these strengths, this study has a few weaknesses. Since, the basic
reproduction number was estimated by taking some parameter values from other
studies and an approximated value of the number of undetected cases, the findings of
this model may differ slightly from its actual value.
6. Conclusions
The COVID-19 disease risk increases with the growing number of undetected
cases. Besides, individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals can
unknowingly spread the infection at a very high rate to those around them. Therefore,
to control the disease spread, it is crucial to identify and socially isolate such
undetected and exposed cases.
