Abstract (147/150)

46

Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous persons in the United States have an increased risk of SARS-

47

CoV-2 infection and death from COVID-19, due to persistent social inequities. The magnitude of

48

the disparity is unclear, however, because race/ethnicity information is often missing in

49

surveillance data. In this study, we quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

50

hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined

51

race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias-adjustment for misclassification. After bias-

52

adjustment, the magnitude of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity, measured as the difference in

53

infection rates between classified Black and Hispanic persons compared to classified White

54

persons, increased 1.3-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. These results highlight that complete case

55

analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in infection rates. Collecting race/ethnicity

56

information at time of testing is optimal. However, when data are missing, combined imputation

57

and bias-adjustment improves estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.

Introduction

62

In the United States, early surveillance reports highlight that persons of Hispanic, Black, and

63

American Indian/Alaskan Native race and ethnicity are disproportionately affected by the

64

COVID-19 pandemic.1 These disparities arise from historical and contemporary social and

65

health inequities that result from systemic racism.2–4 Racial capitalism in particular produces

66

structurally unequal exposure to (and protection from) SARS-CoV-2 infection in key places of

67

transmission (e.g. workplace).3

68

The role of systemic racism in the pandemic motivates the need for accurate surveillance of

69

racial/ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2 infection and death. However, there are challenges in

70

estimating COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities.5,6 Although reports highlight the unequal burden

71

across racial/ethnic groups, the magnitude of disparities is uncertain because of the large

72

proportion of missing race/ethnicity information in surveillance data. In recent reports,

73

race/ethnicity information was missing in 56% of confirmed infections nationally and in 36% in

74

Georgia.7,8 Current surveillance estimates are reported as complete case analyses, which

75

exclude cases with missing race/ethnicity.1,5,8,9 Complete case analyses will bias racial/ethnic

76

disparity estimates if race/ethnicity information is not missing completely at random.10

77

The Department of Health and Human Services issued COVID-19 reporting guidelines in June

78

requiring all labs to report race/ethnicity beginning August 2020.11 These guidelines seek to

79

address missing data moving forward, but fail to address missing information for case-patients

80

identified before August.

81

Collecting race/ethnicity information at time of testing is optimal, especially in surveillance of

82

racial/ethnic health disparities. Until this becomes routine, imputation of missing race/ethnicity

83

combined with quantitative bias-adjustment to account for misclassification of the imputed

84

race/ethnicity can improve estimates of the COVID-19 burden among racial/ethnic groups when

In this study, we calculate SARS-CoV-2 infection,

90

Methods

91

Fulton County, Georgia, includes the city of Atlanta and residents identify as Black (44%), White

92

(40%), Hispanic (7%), Asian (7%), and other races/ethnicities (2%).13 Between 29 February

93

2020 and 18 Aug 2020, 19,637 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported among Fulton

94

County residents. Case reports included the patients’ residential address, full name,

95

race/ethnicity, hospitalization (yes/no/unknown), and death (yes/no/unknown). Fulton County

96

Board of Health staff geocoded case-patients’ address to census block groups. For this

97

analysis, we categorized reported race/ethnicity as Black, Hispanic, Asian, White or Other.

98

We accounted for missing race/ethnicity information using a three-step approach: 1) imputation

99

of race/ethnicity for all case-patients, 2) validation of the race/ethnicity imputation by calculating

100

the accuracy of imputation among case-patients with reported race/ethnicity information, and 3)

101

bias-adjustment of race/ethnicity estimates to account for misclassification of imputation among

102

case-patients missing reported race/ethnicity information. Hereafter, we refer to race/ethnicity as

103

reported when provided in case-patient records, imputed when referring to the imputed case-

104

patient race/ethnicity, and classified when referring to the combined reported and imputed

105

race/ethnicity after bias-adjustment.

106

First, for all case-patients we predicted their racial/ethnic group using the Bayesian Improved

107

Surname Geocoding method.14 This method estimates the probability of a person being

108

classified as Black, Hispanic, Asian, White or Other race/ethnic group based on the case4

109

patient’s surname and residential census block group, and the population distribution of

110

race/ethnicity for census block groups and surnames. Imputation was performed using the R

111

package “wru,” which includes the 2010 surname census list with corresponding race/ethnicity

112

distribution. Geographic distribution of race/ethnicity came from the 2018 5-year American

113

Community Survey.15,16 For the 546 (2.8%) case-patients who could not be geocoded,

114

race/ethnicity was imputed using surname only.

115

Second, we validated the race/ethnicity imputation among case-patients whose race/ethnicity

116

was available in the dataset (n=12,222, 64%). Predictive values (PV) were calculated for each

117

imputed race/ethnic group. The PV is the probability that a person’s reported race/ethnicity

118

group classification was correctly imputed.12

119

Third, we used the PV values as bias parameters to quantitatively adjust for the expected

120

misclassification of the imputed race/ethnicity groups. We assigned each race/ethnicity group

121

PV from the validation to a Dirichlet distribution (Table 1). We then reclassified the imputed

122

race/ethnicity

123

mathematically accounts for inaccurate assignment of case-patients to a race/ethnicity group by

124

the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding method. Sampling error was incorporated into the

125

estimates using bootstrap approximation from a standard normal distribution.12

126

For both the complete case and bias-adjusted analyses, we calculated the SARS-CoV-2

127

infection rates (per 1,000 persons), hospitalization proportions (hospitalized cases/reported

128

cases), and case fatality rates (deaths/reported cases) by race/ethnicity group. We reported

129

95% confidence intervals (CI) for the complete case analysis and medians with 95% simulation

130

intervals (SI) for the bias-adjusted estimates. We evaluated how accounting for missing

131

race/ethnicity information impacts measures of racial/ethnic disparities by calculating the

132

differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in each race/ethnicity group compared with persons

probabilistically

(100,000

iterations).12

of White race/ethnicity, among case-patients with reported race/ethnicity information, and

134

among all case-patients after bias-adjustment. All analyses used R v3.6 (Vienna, Austria). The

135

Georgia Department of Health determined this activity to be consistent with public health

136

surveillance, so does not require informed consent or IRB approval.

137

Results

138

Among the 19,637 cases reported in Fulton County from 29 February to 19 August 2020, 7,145

139

(36%) were missing race/ethnicity information in the case report. Data were more complete

140

among the 1,840 hospitalized case-patients, where only 14 (3.5%) were missing race/ethnicity

141

information. All deceased case-patients (n=456) had complete information on race/ethnicity.

142
143

Comparison of reported versus imputed race/ethnicity group showed that the algorithm’s

144

imputation accuracy varied by imputed race/ethnicity group (Table 1). Of the 5,535 persons who

145

were imputed as Black race/ethnicity, 93% (95%CI: 92%, 93%) were reported as Black in case

146

reports (n=5,118). Among persons imputed as Hispanic ethnicity, 84% (95%CI: 82%, 85%)

147

were reported as Hispanic. The algorithm was less accurate for case-patients with race/ethnicity

148

imputed as Asian (PV=69%, 95%CI: 61%, 74%) and as White (PV=55%, 95%CI: 53%, 56%).

149

The PV estimates for racial/ethnic groups changed over time, likely due to changes in the

150

prevalence of demographic groups affected by the pandemic over time (Supplemental Table

151

1).

152
153

In both the complete case and bias-adjusted analyses, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were

154

highest among those classified as Other, followed by Hispanic, Black, White, and Asian (Table

155

2a and 2b). Imputation and bias-adjustment yielded higher estimates of infection rates than

156

complete case analysis because more case-patients were included in the numerator. Estimated

157

infection rates increased 1.8-fold for persons classified as Asian, 1.7-fold for White, 1.7-fold for

158

Hispanic, 1.6-fold for Other, and 1.5-fold for Black. Hospitalization proportions and case fatality

159

rates decreased across all race/ethnicity groups with imputation and bias-adjustment compared

160

with the complete case analyses, because more cases were included in the denominator. In

161

both the complete case and bias-adjusted analyses, case-patients who were classified as Black

162

race/ethnicity had the highest hospitalization proportions (complete case: 17%, 95%CI: 16%,

163

18%; bias-adjusted: 12%, 95%SI: 11%, 12%) and case fatality rates (complete case: 4.6%,

164

95%CI: 4.1%, 5.1%; bias-adjusted: 3.1%, 95%SI: 2.8%, 3.4%).

165
166

The magnitude of the absolute disparity—difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates for case-

167

patients classified in each race/ethnicity group compared with case-patients classified White—

168

increased in the bias-adjusted analysis relative to the complete case analysis for nearly all

169

race/ethnicity groups (Table 3). When comparing bias-adjusted with complete case results, the

170

absolute disparity in infection rates increased 1.3-fold among classified Black and 1.6-fold

171

among classified Hispanic race/ethnicity groups in reference to case-patients classified as

172

White.

173
174

Discussion

175

In this study, accounting for missing race/ethnicity information revealed greater differences in

176

SARS-CoV-2 infection rates comparing most racial/ethnic groups with case-patients of White

177

race. These results suggest that national estimates, which exclude case-patients with missing

178

race/ethnicity information, may underestimate the magnitude of absolute racial/ethnic disparities

179

in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.6,8

180

Our results underscore the need for imputation combined with bias-adjustment. In our study

181

population, the PV estimates indicated that imputation alone overestimated infections among

7

182

case-patients classified as White and underestimated infections among case-patients classified

183

as Black. Therefore, imputation alone would have been insufficient.

184

Both the complete case analysis and the bias-adjusted estimates demonstrate important

185

absolute racial/ethnic disparities in the infection rates. The bias-adjusted estimates do not

186

change our understanding of the direction of racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic;

187

however, the magnitude of racial/ethnic disparities changed meaningfully after bias-adjustment.

188

In contrast, the hospitalization proportion and case fatality rate decreased across all classified

189

race/ethnicity groups after accounting for missing race/ethnicity information because few

190

hospitalized or deceased case-patients were missing race/ethnicity information. These results

191

highlight the need for more complete reporting so that health equity and racial justice efforts

192

aimed at addressing these disparities operate on the most accurate data possible.

193

The imputation of race/ethnicity has limitations. The Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding

194

algorithm limits the racial/ethnic groups that can be imputed to Black, Hispanic, Asian, White, or

195

Other. The reliance on categories of ‘other’ is problematic for identifying and addressing

196

disparities in other racial/ethnic populations (e.g. indigenous populations). Future studies should

197

explore how accounting for missing race/ethnicity impacts other disease burden measures.

198

Our findings emphasize the importance of collecting complete race/ethnicity data at the time of

199

testing, for the current pandemic and future outbreaks. When data are missing, Bayesian

200

Improved Surname Geocoding combined with quantitative bias-adjustment provides better

201

estimates of the racial/ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, hospitalization

202

proportions, and case fatality rates.
