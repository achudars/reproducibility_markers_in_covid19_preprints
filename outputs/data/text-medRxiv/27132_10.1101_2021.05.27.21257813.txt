Abstract
Background: Hypocalcaemia has been reported in the context of acute COVID-19,
where it has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and disease
severity. Calcium is an important intracellular messenger that controls diverse
cellular processes. Two other clinically important coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can use calcium ions to enter and
replicate

within

host

cells.

Calcium may therefore

be

important

in

the

pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. We sought to investigate whether calcium
derangement was a specific feature of COVID-19 that distinguishes it from other
infective pneumonias, and its association with disease severity.

Methods: We conducted a single centre retrospective study of albumin-corrected
serum calcium on adult patients with COVID-19 who presented between March 1st
and May 16th 2020. The primary outcome was maximal level of care based on the
World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale for COVID-19. Cases with
community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and viral pneumonia (VP) were identified
through a clinical database over three intervals (January to February 2018, January
to February 2019 and September to December 2019).

Results: We analysed data from 506 patients with COVID-19, 95 patients with CAP
and 152 patients with VP. Hypocalcaemia (serum calcium <2.2mmol/L) was a
specific and common clinical finding in patients with COVID-19 that was not present
in other respiratory infections.

Calcium levels were significantly lower in those with

severe disease. Ordinal regression of risk estimates for categorised care levels
showed that baseline hypocalcaemia was incrementally associated with odds ratio of
2.33 for higher level of care, superior to other variables that have previously been

shown to predict worse COVID-19 outcome. Serial calcium levels showed
improvement by day 7-9 of admission, only in in survivors of COVID-19.

Conclusion: Hypocalcaemia may independently predict not only more severe but
more progressive disease and warrants detailed prognostic investigation. The fact
that decreased serum calcium is observed at the time of clinical presentation in
COVID-19, but not other infective pneumonias, suggests that its early derangement
is pathophysiological and may influence the deleterious evolution of this disease. If
calcium is ultimately shown to be critical to the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2
in host cells, unravelling how this mechanism could be therapeutically targeted
deserves more intensive examination.

Introduction
COVID-19, the disease responsible for the pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in nearly three
million deaths worldwide. The identification of well-defined COVID-19 prognostic
markers has advanced the clinical understanding of this disease (1–3).
Hypocalcaemia has been reported in the context of acute COVID-19 where it has
been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and morbidity (4–9).
However, its role in predicting mortality has been less clear, with reports of a
conflicting effect (6,10–12)

Neither the pathogenic role played by hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 nor the possibility
that its occurrence might simply reflect underlying illness severity has been
established. However, the fact that decreased serum calcium is consistently
observed at the time of clinical presentation suggests that its early derangement may
potentially influence the deleterious evolution of this disease at an individual level.

Calcium is a versatile intracellular messenger involved in controlling diverse
biological processes spanning gene expression, cell proliferation and cell death
(13). Its role in promoting pathogen apoptosis during intracellular infection has been
recognised in host defence (13). Conversely, some viruses have evolved ways to
promote calcium availability to their own pathogenic, replicative and survival
advantage (14–16). More specifically, alterations in calcium homeostasis effected by
enhanced ion transportation through coronavirus envelope (E) proteins that act as
viroporins has been linked to the activation of inflammatory cascades by the SARS-1
coronavirus (17). It has recently been proposed SARS-CoV-2 may also utilise this or
similar mechanisms to augment its infectivity during host-virus interactions (18)

In the current retrospective study, we compared the prevalence of hypocalcaemia
and its association with clinical outcome in different forms of infective pneumonia
including COVID-19. We found an increased frequency of hypocalcaemia in COVID19 that distinguished it from the other pneumonias and observed a correlation
between low calcium and increased COVID-19 severity as assessed by indices of
oxygenation, leucocytosis and extent of chest radiographic abnormality. Further
investigations revealed an association between hypocalcaemia and increasing levels
of respiratory support in the sickest patients with COVID-19. Moreover, in observing
that low calcium levels subsequently improved in survivors of COVID-19, we
postulated that hypocalcaemia may independently predict not only more severe but
more progressive disease. In this regard, its role in COVID-19 prognostication
warrants detailed prospective investigation.

Methods
Adult patients aged 18 years or older with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing
by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were retrospectively recruited at
Watford General Hospital, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust between March 1st and
May 16th 2020 (NHS HRA: 20/HRA/2344). A pre-specified study protocol including
data collection methodology has been published elsewhere (19). Control cases
diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and viral pneumonia (VP)
were identified through a clinical database for three defined intervals over two
preceding winters prior to the emergence of COVID-19 (January – February 2018,
January – February 2019 and September – December 2019).

CAP was diagnosed on the basis of respiratory symptoms and signs indicative of a
lower respiratory tract infection, with new plain radiographic abnormalities including

lobar infiltrates or consolidation (20). VP was diagnosed by positive viral
identification in swabbed nasal and oropharyngeal acute respiratory specimens and
analysed by the BioFire® respiratory panel, which identifies amongst others
Influenzae A and B, Rhinoenterovirus, Human Metapneumovirus, Coronaviruses
(OC43, HKU1, NL63), Picornovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus.

An analysis was first undertaken to highlight differences in core clinical
characteristics between patients with COVID-19, CAP and VP. Subsequently and
only for the COVID-19 subgroup, the impact of an abnormally low calcium level on
the maximum level of hospital care, as a surrogate of COVID-19 severity, was
evaluated. The selection of maximal care level as the primary outcome was based
on the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale for COVID-19
(21). Patients were categorised at four levels of care: (i) mild ambulatory disease
qualifying for monitoring in a virtual hospital (VH) setting, (ii) moderate hospitalised
disease for individuals managed on a medical ward who intermittently required
supplemental oxygen, (iii) severe hospitalised disease for patients who received
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, and (iv) severe hospitalised
disease who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) on the intensive care
unit (ICU).

Hypocalcaemia was defined as albumin-corrected serum calcium <2.2 mmol/L in
serum, a level based on study-defined cut-points. An optimal cut-point of 2.195
mmol/L was associated with a sensitivity of 47%, specificity 43% and univariate odds
ratio of 1.51 for in-hospital death (95% CI 1.14 – 2.00; p<0.01). We excluded patients
with chronic kidney disease (22) and those receiving vitamin D or calcium
supplementation. An index of oxygenation was calculated using the oxygen

saturation-to-fraction of inspired oxygen (S:F) ratio, determined by dividing the SpO2
by the FiO2. A cut off of 4.38 represented saturations of 92% on fraction of inspired
oxygen 21% (room air).

A subgroup analysis was undertaken to assess 25 Hydroxy Vitamin D level in
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia; because vitamin D was not routinely measured
as part of protocolized COVID-19 care, we included the result of a small subgroup of
patients with mild or severe COVID-19 (presenting between December 2020 and
January 2021) where the measurement was recorded prospectively within three
days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as median with interquartile range (IQR) and
the Kruskal−Wallis equality-of-population or H test was used to compare differences
among groups. Categorical variables were expressed as frequency (%) and
analysed using Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. To assess the effect of
hypocalcaemia on the primary outcome, and taking account of potential co-variate
effects with other independent variables, we used ordinal (ordered) logistic
regression to compare the odds ratios of these variables on pre-defined outcome
categories of maximal care level. A goodness-of-fit (Brant) test was employed to
ensure that the proportional odds assumption was met. A non-significant test statistic
(P>0.05) provided evidence that the full model did not show a significant difference
to restricted models with selected explanatory variables. Following this, a partial
proportional odds model was refined to test parallel odds against alternatives
(Peterson and Harrell, 1990). A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered

and STATA, V.16 (Stata, Texas, USA).

Results

Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between study
subgroups
We analysed data from 506 patients (54.9% male) with COVID-19, 95 patients with
CAP (53.6% male) and 152 patients with VP (44% male). The median age of the
COVID-19 cohort was 65 (IQR 52-80) similar to that of VP patients (68, IQR 45-79)
but lower than the median age of patients with CAP (79; IQR 67-86). (Table 1)

Amongst patients with COVID-19, individuals of White Caucasian ethnicity
constituted 75.6% (383/506) of the cohort while Asian, Black and other minor
ethnicities (BAME) represented 16.5%, 4.5% and 1.7%, respectively. In comparison,
White Caucasian ethnicity comprised a higher proportion of patients with CAP
(85.2%) and VP (88.1%) (p<0.001 vs COVID-19).

To assess the level of severity of pneumonic illness across the three cohorts, we
used a panel of common clinical variables conventionally taken to indicate disease
severity at presentation. We found similar levels of hypoxia, tachypnoea and
baseline CRP in patients with COVID-19 and CAP. Whereas CAP was associated
with higher peripheral leucocytosis, a significantly higher proportion of patients with
COVID-19 had multifocal infiltrates affecting 4 or more zones on plain chest
radiography. Patients with VP had significantly lower CRP and limited radiographic
changes.

The median length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19 was significantly longer
compared with CAP and VP: COVID-19 7.5 days (IQR 4.0-13.2), CAP 5.4 days (IQR
2.2-10.5) and VP 4.0 days (IQR 1.1-9.5) (p < 0.01). The in-patient mortality amongst
COVID-19 patients was 30.6%, similar to that of patients with CAP (28%) but
significantly higher than patients with viral pneumonia (4.6%, p<0.0001 COVID-19
vs. VP) (Table 1).

Hypocalcaemia was evident in 53% of patients with COVID-19 at initial assessment
but only in 11.5% (11/95) and 10.5% (16/152) of patients with CAP and VP
respectively (p<0.0001 vs COVID-19) (Figure 1). Hypocalcaemic patients with
COVID-19 were more likely to be male (62.1% vs. 46.0%; p<0.001) and obese
(34.0% vs. 23.8%, p<0.05). Median corrected calcium in COVID-19 was 2.19 mmol/L
(IQR 2.11-2.27) compared to 2.31 mmol/L (IQR 2.24-2.38) in patients with CAP and
2.34 mmol/L (IQR 2.24-2.44) in those with VP. The between-group difference in
baseline serum adjusted calcium was significant (p<0.001).

Hypocalcaemia in patients with COVID-19 was associated with greater physiological,
biochemical and radiological derangement than normocalcaemia (Figure 2).
Crucially, hypocalcaemic patients had a higher median respiratory rate compared to
normocalcaemic patients (24/min, IQR 20-30 vs 22/min, IQR 18-28; p<0.005) and a
lower baseline S:F ratio indicative of worse hypoxia at presentation (4.38 vs 4.52;
p<0.01). The extent of baseline radiographic abnormality attributed to COVID-19
pneumonia was similarly greater in those with hypocalcaemia (p<0.001 vs
normocalcaemia). Furthermore, hypocalcaemia was associated with a higher CRP
(85, IQR 42-148 vs 60, IQR 32 -124; p<0.01). Although peripheral leucocytosis was
not associated with hypocalcaemia, patients with low calcium had statistically worse
lymphopenia than normocalcaemic individuals even though the difference was small
(0.85 x109/L vs 0.98 x 109/L; p<0.05).

Hypocalcaemia was more common in patients with COVID-19 segregated by
increasing level of hospital care. Whereas 27.8% (22/79) of patients with mild
ambulatory COVID-19 were hypocalcaemic, the rate doubled to 53.3% (175/328)
among those with moderate severity COVID-19. The proportion was higher still
(72.1%; 70/97) in individuals with severe COVID-19 (Table 2). Hypocalcaemia at
presentation was thus associated with a higher unadjusted odds ratio for severe
COVID-19 (2.74; 95% CI 1.69-4.43)

As expected, hypocalcaemia was also

associated with an increased length of hospital stay compared to patients who had
normal corrected calcium (median 7.5 vs 4.0 days; p<0.0001) (Figure 3B). In
contrast, hypocalcaemia in patients with CAP and VP was not associated with either
disease severity or length of stay (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table 1).

pneumonia is associated with a wide range of severity and that patients may
progress from initially mild to more consequential disease, our analyses made two
assumptions: first, that the outcome categories (different care levels) followed a
natural order within the studied range of disease severity, and second, proportional
odds assumption of the effect of hypocalcaemia on the same outcome categories
was obeyed. A goodness-of-fit test, in this case the Brant test, was used to
determine proportional odds assumption (Supplementary table 2).

Based on initial analyses, a partial proportional odds model was developed that
excluded increasing age as an exploratory variable as it violated the proportional (or
parallel) odds assumption rule for the chosen outcome (Peterson and Harrell, 1990).
Older age has been shown in numerous studies to be the most dominant
independent predictor of death in COVID-19, suggesting that its prognostic impact
on any categorised COVID-19 outcome was likely to be disproportionate. An
analysis of ordinal logistic regression was thus formulated based on maximum
likelihood fit of the predictive model to the data (Table 3). In the final model,
variables with the highest odds ratios (all ≥2.00) for predicting a higher level of care
were chest radiographic zones, hypocalcaemia, S:F ratio and CRP.

Normalisation of serum calcium level in survivors of severe COVID-19
To assess trends in calcium level over the course of COVID-19, we identified two
groups for analysis: survivors (n=74; 56% male; median age 76, IQR 60 - 80) and
non-survivors (n=60; 61% male; median age 79, IQR 62-83). Both groups shared a
similar level of baseline hypocalcaemia (2.12 mmol/L vs 2.13 mmol/L respectively),
median length of hospital stay (11 vs 10 days) and avoidance of ICU. Survivors and
non-survivors remained hypocalcaemic until day 4-6, though there was a significant
difference between the two groups (2.18 mmol/L versus 2.13 mmol/L respectively,
p=0.02). By day 7-9, serum calcium had normalised to 2.25 mmol/L amongst
survivors whereas it remained below the reference range 2.13 mmol/L in nonsurvivors, similar to admission (p< 0.0001). The difference in corrected calcium
concentration was even greater 9 days or more after admission. At discharge from

mmol/L in non-survivors (Figure 4). None of these patients received calcium
supplementation during their hospital admission.

Discussion
In this retrospective analysis, we found hypocalcaemia to be a common feature of
COVID-19, with a frequency and degree of derangement that was greater than in
non-COVID-19 community-acquired pneumonia and viral pneumonia. We also
observed that low calcium in COVID-19 was associated with measures of abnormal
physiology including oxygenation and respiratory rate, radiographic extent of
pneumonic involvement and elevated CRP.

Low calcium was specifically linked to severe disease and different levels of hospital
care aligned with increasing levels respiratory support (a surrogate index of severity
of COVID-19 pneumonia). Ordinal regression of risk estimates for categorised care
levels showed that baseline hypocalcaemia was incrementally associated with an
over two-fold risk for a higher level of care. Its adjusted odds ratio (2.33) was higher
than that for variables that have previously been shown to predict worse COVID-19
outcome, such as hypoxia and tachypnoea. It was also greater than the odds ratio
attributed to CRP and nearly as high as that for the extent of radiographic disease.

Unlike some of these parameters, hypocalcaemia has not been included in COVID19 severity prediction scores (2,3,23). This could be because advancing age and
CKD are predictors of poor outcome in COVID-19, both of which impact calcium
homeostasis. Older adults are also more likely to be on calcium supplementation.
However, the distinct association between baseline hypocalcaemia and COVID-19
severity suggests that it could potentially contribute to multivariable stratification of
COVID-19 outcome, and importantly, predict the need for additional respiratory
support in a select subgroup of young patients without CKD.

Hypocalcaemia has previously been associated with a higher risk of hospitalization
(5), ICU admission (10,12), ventilation and, in some cases, mortality in patients with
COVID-19 (8). Our data is consistent with these findings. However, the rate of
hypocalcaemia in our study of 53% was lower than 62 to 74.4% reported in other
studies (4,5,7–10)). This difference may be due to case-mix or cohort heterogeneity,
specifically the inclusion of patients with mild disease who were managed in a virtual
hospital setting in our study.

Low serum calcium is most commonly caused by Vitamin D deficiency, insufficient
PTH production and renal dysfunction. In order to reduce the confounding effect of
renal failure on hypocalcaemia, these patients were excluded from analysis. There
is conflicting evidence on the link between Vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19
severity; one retrospective study from Israel reported independent associations
between low pre-pandemic Vitamin D levels and subsequent incidence and severity
of COVID-19 (24), but an analogous study in the UK failed to show such
associations (25). In a preliminary analysis of 30 patients with mild versus severe
COVID-19, we found that whereas calcium levels were significantly lower in severe
disease, Vitamin D levels were not (Supplementary Figure 2). A larger sample size,
matched for age and ethnicity (which both impact Vitamin D levels) is necessary to
further corroborate these preliminary findings.

The role of PTH in COVID-19 is unclear but normal PTH levels have been reported
in a limited study of hospitalized patients with this disease (10). Whilst it is unlikely
that PTH insufficiency is the sole or even primary driver of hypocalcaemia in COVID19, this area requires further investigation.

Two clinically important coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS)-CoV, can use calcium ions to enter host cells, mediated by a
fusion peptide derived from the viral spike protein (26,27). It could be postulated that
similar calcium-dependent mechanisms might operate during the pathogenic process
involving calcium handling during SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection. In support of this
hypothesis, calcium channel blockers including amlodipine have been shown to
inhibit post-entry replication events of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (28). In one observational
study, amlodipine therapy was also associated with a decreased case fatality rate in
19

hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28). Other mechanisms of calcium-mediated
inflammation and tissue injury may involve the activation of the viral NLRP3
inflammasome leading to IL-1beta over-production and downstream activation and
propagation of tissue inflammatory cascades (Nieto-Torres 2015; Cron, 2021; Huet
et al., 2020; Webb et al., 2020).

Hypocalcaemia is common in critically ill patients, with a reported prevalence of up to
88% of all patients admitted to intensive care (29,30). In our study, baseline
hypocalcaemia was frequently evident in COVID-19 patients even amongst those
who were not ultimately admitted to the ICU. Patients with COVID-19 also had
comparable baseline illness characteristics as CAP, such as respiratory rate, S:F
ratio, prevalence of elevated CRP, frequency of lymphopenia. However, the
frequency of hypocalcaemia was significantly higher and the median concentration of
serum calcium lower in those with COVID-19 patients compared to those with CAP.
This finding suggests the possibility of hypocalcaemia being pathophysiologically
more pertinent in COVID-19. In line with this, a lower serum calcium level within the
COVID-19 subgroup was clearly associated with worse respiratory illness and a
need for greater respiratory support.

Our study was limited by its retrospective design and resultant occurrence of missing
data (<15% for COVID-19 and CAP subgroups), with the fullest data available for
COVID-19 and the least for patients with VP. The modest sample size of our COVID19 cohort was dependent on the incident caseload during the first wave of the
pandemic, and a small sample size of CAP and VP patients. The data on vitamin D
and PTH measurements was insufficient as these parameters were not routinely
measured in the management of COVID-19 or the other pneumonias. In addition the

measurement of ionized calcium (the unbound calcium available to cells) would be
more accurate and physiologically relevant than measuring the total body calcium by
corrected for albumin (31). However, in the absence of ionized calcium
measurements, corrected calcium was felt to be a reasonable alternative that more
accurately reflected calcium stores compared to calcium that was not adjusted for
protein binding.

Our data show that hypocalcaemia is clinically important during both the acute
presentation of COVID-19 as well as its subsequent evolution to more severe
respiratory failure. Further studies are required to help bridge the biological
understanding of hypocalcaemia and its pathophysiological significance to this
devastating disease. If calcium is ultimately shown to be critical to the entry and
replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells, unravelling how this mechanism could be
therapeutically targeted deserves more intensive examination.
