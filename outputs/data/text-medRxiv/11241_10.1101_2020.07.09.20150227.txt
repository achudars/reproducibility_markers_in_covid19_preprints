Abstract. Shelter-in-place and other confinement strategies implemented in the
current COVID-19 pandemic have created stratified patterns of contacts between
people: close contacts within households and more distant contacts between the
households. The epidemic transmission dynamics is significantly modified as a
consequence.
We introduce a minimal model that incorporates these household effects in the
framework of mean-field theory and numerical simulations. We show that the
reproduction number R0 depends on the household size in a surprising way: linearly
for relatively small households, and as a square root of size for larger households. We
discuss the implications of the findings for the lockdown, test, tracing, and isolation
policies.

A minimal model for household effects in epidemics

1. Introduction
The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic is a threat
to global public health with very few precedents. The policy response thus far has
often been informed by epidemiological modeling, such as [1]. This paper offers some
suggestions for improving such models by accounting for intra-household effects. The
role of inside-household transmission for COVID epidemiology has been recognized early
[2, 3, 4]. In this work we investigate the combination of relatively fast transmission inside
the households and relatively slower transmission between them.
An important feature in epidemiological models is the way the individuals come in
contact with each other within the model framework. The simplest assumption is the
panmictic one: everybody comes in contact with everybody else with equal probability,
and thus has a chance to infect everybody else [5, 6, 7]. On the other end of the spectrum
are detailed individual-based models where we know exactly who contacts whom at the
individual level [8, 9, 10].
The widespread COVID-19 pandemic and resultant partial quarantine measures
make the panmictic assumption unrealistic: if confinement works, one hopes to lower
the number of contacts outside the immediate surroundings of every individual. On the
other hand, detailed models are quite effective at explaining what has happened in the
past, but predictions about the future and the results of lockdown policies in the context
of these models require detailed assumptions on the mode of future contacts between
individuals. These details are knowable in hindsight, but are rather difficult to predict.
These considerations suggest a third approach: idealized models that are more
realistic than the classical panmictic ones, but less detailed than those based on
individual data. In this class of models, we describe the way the population interacts
through a limited number of well-defined parameters. These parameters are influenced
by policy decisions, so models of this kind can be used to predict the result of specific
policies on the spread of contagion. An example of such models is Stroud‚Äôs model of
influenza spreading in a mixed population [11], where the inhomogeneity was represented
by a semi-empirical power law, partially justified by simulations, for the probability of
a new infection.
In this paper, we describe the effect of household size on sheltering in place, with
application to the current COVID-19 epidemic. We assume that, due to shelter-inplace orders, the contacts between people in different households are uniformly reduced.
However, no shelter-in-place policies restrict the interactions between the members of
the same household. In fact, these interactions may become much closer and more
frequent than before the epidemic. The epidemiological data on COVID-19 in close
quarters such as cruise ships [12] suggest very high contagion rates in such situations.
Therefore, it makes sense to discuss the spread of infection in a model where people
are separated into close-knit groups (‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù) with a high rate of contagion within
groups relative to the rate of contagion between groups.
The idea of modeling epidemics in a stratified population is, of course, not new.

Figure 1. Household model. Black symbols correspond to infected individuals.

Approaches similar to ours were employed in [13] to simulate the 1918 flu pandemic and
in [14, 15] to study the effect of isolation and vaccination. In [16, 17] the dependence
of the spread of infection was obtained in a household model, but with different
assumptions from ours, which lead to different predictions.
Usually these approaches rely on many parameters to describe the dynamics of
transmission. Here, we instead employ a minimal model that simply introduces withinhousehold transmission in a standard SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) formalism.
This approach allows us to isolate the effect of household sizes from other factors that
would affect more detailed descriptions. It is also analytically tractable and presents a
phase space that depends on only a few parameters, so it can be thoroughly explored
numerically. We are thus able to obtain a simple mathematical law that describes the
growth of the epidemic‚Äôs rate of spread as a function of the household size. While more
finely grained models could offer a more detailed description, we expect this law to be
universal as long as our main premises ‚Äîhigh transmission rate for close contacts and
high rate of asymptomatic transmission‚Äî are satisfied.
Below, in Section 2, we describe the model in detail and calculate the fast-growing
modes. This analysis provides insight into the initial dynamics of epidemics and the
influence of various parameters on the rate of infection. In Section 3, we report on the
results of simulations and numerical solution of the mean-field equations. In Section 4,
we discuss the results and their meaning for lockdown strategies. The conclusions are
stated in Section 5.

2. Mean-field models
Let us discuss a population separated into households with high contact rates within a
household and low contact rates between different households.
We will use the SIR model with three states for each individual: Susceptible,
Infected, and Recovered, as shown on Figure 2. The state of a household is described
by the number of individuals in each state (s, i, r). If H is the household size, then
s + i + r = H. In this section, we use a simple model where the first infection quickly
leads to the whole household being infected, so the simplified state diagram becomes the
one shown in Figure 3. Let S be the number of households with noone infected, F be
the number of households with one person infected, and G be the number of households
with everyone infected. The total number of infected persons is F + HG. Let us
neglect secondary outside transmission, i.e., the situation when a member of an already
infected household gets infected through an outside contact. Then the probability that
an arbitrary contact of an infected person is susceptible is SH/N , where N is the total
number of persons. If Œ≤ is the transmission rate, then the number of households is
governed by the equations

where Œ± is the rate of having the whole household infected, and Œ≥ is the recovery rate.
We assume the recovery rate for all household members is the same and neglect the
difference in the time of infections of different household members.
If all members of the household are quickly infected by the index patient, the rate
constant Œ± does not depend on the household size H. If contagion spreads through
aerosols or shared surfaces [18], the rate of spread does not depend on H. This suggests
that the dependence Œ±(H) is weak or non-existent. Therefore, in the subsequent models
we neglect this dependence, and discuss its possible effects in the Appendix.

A fast in-household transmission corresponds to Œ±  Œ≤. Equation (3) shows that there
are two regimes for the transmission. For small household sizes, when 2(2H ‚àí 1)Œ≤  Œ±,
the exponent for the growth of infections depends on H linearly, as Œª ‚âà HŒ≤ ‚àí Œ≥.
However, for larger households, when 2(2H ‚àí 1)Œ≤  Œ±, the effective growth rate is
‚àö
proportional to the square root of H, Œª ‚âà Œ±Œ≤H ‚àí Œ≥. This finding is in contrast with
the one in [16], where a linear dependence on H was found under different assumptions.
It is customary to quantify epidemic-growth potential using the basic reproduction
number R0 , which is equal to the increase in the number of infections during the course
of disease for an individual patient. For this model

We will assume Œ≥ ‚âà 0.125 days‚àí1 and the rate of spread in the absence of lockdown
Œ≤ ‚âà 0.3 [19]. Setting different values for Œ≤ under lockdown, we plot the values of R0 on
Figure 4.
3. Numerical modeling
Eigenvalue analysis of equations (1) and (2) is applicable in the linear regime only. For
the situation where the depletion of the susceptible population is non-negligible, we need
either to solve these equations numerically or perform simulations. Below we report the
results of both approaches.
We performed numerical simulations to validate the analytical models of household
infections described in the above section. In each scenario that we studied, we took a
population of N = 200 000 individuals, placed each individual into a house for a range
of different household sizes, and subsequently initialized a small random subset of 20
individuals in the population with an infection. For each step, we divided the infection
into two phases:
(i) Panmictic phase: each infected individual can infect any uninfected individual in
the simulation, with a probability p0 = ‚àÜt NŒ≤ , where Œ≤ is the daily rate of infection
in the panmictic phase, N is the population size and ‚àÜt is the time step of the
simulation.
(ii) Household phase: each infected individual can infect any uninfected individual in
their house, with a probability ‚àÜtŒ±, where Œ± is the daily rate of infection inside
the household.
We studied these regimes using ‚àÜt = 0.1 and Œ≥ = 0.125. We ran a different
simulation for various combinations of Œ±, Œ≤ and H. For each combination of values

we ran the simulations n = 10 times. For the same parameters we numerically solved
equations (1) and (2). The results are shown in Figure 5.
The model shows a very good agreement between the predictions of the mean-field
theory and numerical experiments, especially for large in-household transmission Œ±. It
should be noted that the meaning of Œ± is subtly different for simulations and meanfield theory. For simulations, Œ± is the rate for an individual to become infected inside
a household; while for mean-field theory, Œ± is the rate for a household as a whole to
become fully infected. These two definitions are expected to be convergent in the limit
of fast inside infections, as seems to be the case from Figure 5.
It is interesting to look at the total number of cases during the epidemics. The

results of our simulations for N = 200 000 are shown on Figure 6.
4. Discussion
Our approach is based on the existence of two time scales: fast transmission inside
households and slow transmission between the households. Following the scaling
approach (see, for example, [21]), we can imagine the households being ‚Äúsuperindividuals‚Äù with renormalized interaction parameters. Since, in this model, H people
have H times as many contacts as one person, one can naƒ±Ãàvely expect that the

spread of contagion scales as the household size H. However, as confirmed by meanfield calculations
‚àö and numerical simulations, the scaling law is less steep: the spread
grows only as H. This fact may have profound policy implications, suggesting the
possible establishment of larger ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù such as social circles) rather than a
uniform reintegration of all contacts during reopening. However, further modeling and
comparison with empirical data would be necessary before implementing the results of
this paper as policy. A rather strong dependence of the total number of cases over the
time span of epidemic on the household size (Figure 6) stresses the necessity of caution
at reopening.
The assumptions underlying the model reveal its natural limitations. For mean-

field calculations (but not numerical simulations), we assumed that inside-household
dynamics are much faster than the transmission between households. This allowed
us to neglect the details of transmission inside households and use an idealized model
depending just on the mean time between the first infection and the completely infected
household. This also allowed us to neglect secondary between-household infections
(i.e., household members of an infected individual getting infected by their outside
contacts rather than by the inside ones). Our numerical simulations did not employ
this assumption explicitly. However, by selecting a very simple inside-household
infection model (pair interactions between household members) we made the assumption
implicitly: the details of the inside transmission should not matter if the transmission is
fast. Another assumption for the mean-field model is the neglect of random fluctuations:
we used mean values to construct the equations. We also neglected the dependence of
the time for a household to become infected on the household size. This dependence
should be significant for very large ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù (see Appendix).
While we use the word ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù throughout this paper, our model may describe
situations beyond the simple picture of families waiting out the epidemics together.
A dormitory, cruise ship, or even apartment building with a common ventilation
system may represent examples of a large ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù (see [22] on the role of common
ventilation systems). While in the calculations here we assume ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù of equal
size, the model could be generalized for a mixture of different groups with a high level
of transmission inside groups and a low level of transmission between the groups.
Another possible application of our model is related to the observation that one
of the ways to slowly reopen may involve the relaxing of social distancing within
certain groups while maintaining it between the groups. In this case, these ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù
groups can be treated as ‚Äúsuper-households‚Äù. An important application of the superhousehold concept could be a rudimentary testing-and-tracing policy, in which we test
all members of the super-household of any asymptomatic infected individual, instead
of a more expensive attempt to trace and test all their contacts. This application
is important because asymptomatic transmission seems to be one of the salient and
dangerous features of the current COVID-19 epidemic [23].
In subsequent papers, we will analyze testing-and-tracing strategies for the
household-based shelter-in-place policy.
5. Conclusions
We studied epidemic spread in a stratified population, such as under shelter-in-place
orders, using mean-field theories and numerical simulations. We found that:
(i) Under shelter-in-place conditions the spread of the epidemics depends on the size
of the ‚Äúhousehold‚Äù (i.e., the group of people sheltered together).
(ii) The dependence of the rate of spread on the household size is linear for relatively
small households and a square-root law for larger households.

We used idealized models to study the general features of the epidemics in the
shelter-in-place conditions. More realistic models may add to these findings, but we
expect the main results above to hold.

Appendix A. Dependence of Œ± on H for large households
In models with small households, Œ± has very little dependence on H since most household
members will be infected in short order by the household‚Äôs first infected individual. In
this case, we ignore secondary infections. However, in large households, it may be
required to take secondary infections within a household into account.
Here, we look at the dependence of Œ± on H in a regime where secondary interactions
are relevant. In particular, this model uses the same method of in-house infection as
the numerical simulations.
Assume that the infection rate within a household is proportional to the number of
‚Äúconnections‚Äù between infecteds and susceptibles. In a household of size H > 1 with n
infecteds, we may draw H(H ‚àí 1)/2 connections between household members; n(H ‚àí n)
of those connections will be between infecteds and susceptibles. That is to say, the
infection rate is Œ±n = Œ±0 n(H ‚àí n) for some constant Œ±0 which is independent of H and
n.
The total time to infect the entire household starting with one infected is therefore
