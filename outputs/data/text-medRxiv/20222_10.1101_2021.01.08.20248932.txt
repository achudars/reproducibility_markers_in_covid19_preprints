Among candidate treatment options for COVID-19, propolis, produced by honey bees
from bioactive plant exudates, has shown potential against viral targets and has
demonstrated immunoregulatory properties. We conducted a randomized, controlled,
open-label, single center trial, with a standardized propolis product (EPP-AF) on
hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. Patients received standard care plus propolis
at an oral dose of 400mg/day (n=40) or 800mg/day (n=42) for seven days, or standard
care alone (n=42). Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined
by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical
improvement defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency.
Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or
vasoactive drugs. Time in the hospital after intervention was significantly shortened in
