22

Whether weather plays a part in the transmissibility of the novel COronaVIrus Disease-

23

19 (COVID-19) is still not established. We tested the hypothesis that meteorological factors (air

24

temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and rainfall) are independently

25

associated with transmissibility of COVID-19 quantified using the basic reproduction rate (R 0).

26

We used publicly available datasets on daily COVID-19 case counts (total n = 108,308), three-

27

hourly meteorological data and community mobility data over a three-month period. Estimated

28

R0 varied between 1.15-1.28. Mean daily air temperature (inversely) and wind speed (positively)

29

were significantly associated with time dependent R 0, but the contribution of countrywide

30

lockdown to variability in R0 was over three times stronger as compared to that of temperature

31

and wind speed combined. Thus, abating temperatures and easing lockdown may concur with

32

increased transmissibility of COVID-19.

INDTRODUCTION

36

As the novel COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19) continues to devastate the world,

37

there remains a myriad of unknowns about its pathogenesis, population dynamics, epidemiology,

38

prevention and treatment. Since its introduction into the global susceptible population SARS-

39

CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has presented several conundrums. It was initially

40

believed that like many other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 may also be responsive to the environmental

41

influences posed by climatic and meteorological factors 1-4. However, current understanding of

42

the potential role of weather on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is far from clear.

43

The COVID-19 outbreaks have been generally more severe in the countries located in the

44

mid-latitudes where the temperature is considerably low in contrast to the tropical countries.

45

Several studies around the world have attempted to specifically establish a relationship between

46

COVID- 19 transmission and various meteorological factors. 5-7 For example, a study conducted

47

in New York, USA, found that mean temperature, minimum temperature and air quality had a

48

significant association with the COVID-19 pandemic.5 Similarly, Shi et al8 reported a

49

statistically significant correlation between daily temperature and daily count of COVID-19

50

cases in China and suggested that temperatures above 8–10 °C would lead to a decline in the

51

number of infected cases. In a parallel investigation, Prata et al 5 concluded that a rise in 1 °C

52

temperature would result in a decrease in the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in

53

Brazil. There have been very few investigations from India in this regard 9-11 – a country with

54

second largest population size after China. These studies from India have generally indicated a

55

potential role of weather conditions in the spread of COVID-19.

56

On the other end of the spectrum, a study conducted by Yao et al12 concluded that there is

57

no association of COVID-19 transmission with temperature or UV radiation in Chinese cities.

58

Indeed, an elegant, evidence-based review by Brassley et al6 summarized the existing evidence

59

in this regard and observed that a. cold and dry conditions may facilitate the spread of the novel

60

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) b. much of the emerging data for 2019-nCoV has yet to be peer-

61

reviewed and is thus needed; and c. relying on weather changes alone to slow the transmission of

62

COVID-19 are unlikely to be sufficient. Considering these recommendations; the variability in

63

the observed associations; and a relative lack of such studies from India, we conducted this

64

investigation on a nationwide sample of geographical locations across India. The primary goal

65

was to test the putative association of geo-meteorological characteristics with rates of COVID-19

66

transmission and to test its independence from other socio-behavioral interventions like

67

lockdowns and mobility.

68

MATERIALS AND METHODS

69

Data sources: We selected a total of 46 geographical locations across India. For each

70

selected location (either a city, union territory or district), we collected data for a three-month

71

period (March 1, 2020 through May 31, 2020). Following data items were collected for each

72

study location: daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, meteorological data, demographic

73

data and overall geographic data. The meteorological data included 3-hourly recordings of

74

temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and rainfall. The demographic data

75

included the 2011 census population and the geographical data included area and elevation. The

76

area and population records were combined to estimate the community density. Lastly, temporal

77

data on the lockdown implementation phases and the mobility of the population (estimated

anonymously from the cellphone use data) was collected to study the potential temporal

79

concurrence with COVID-19 transmission.

80

All data used in this study are publicly available and are completely anonymized. The

81

study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Government Medical College,

82

Nagpur, India. Following were the sources of data: number of daily COVID-19 cases –

83

https://api.covid19india.org/; meteorological data –https://www.tutiempo.net/ and

84

https://www.worldweatheronline.com/; 2011 census data – https://censusindia.gov.in/2011-

85

common/censusdata2011.html; and geographical data – combination of census data and search

86

on Wikipedia® (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia). Lastly, the temporal mobility data was

87

downloaded from the publicly available repository: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/.

88

These indicated percent change from baseline mobility on visits to the following five

89

destinations - retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations and workplaces.

90

Quantification of COVID-19 transmissibility: Using the daily case count data we

91

estimated the basic reproduction rate (R0) in two different ways. First, we estimated the average

92

R0 over the entire duration of 92 days period of data collection. For this, we used two methods –

93

the exponential growth (EG) and the maximum likelihood (ML). Second, we estimated the daily

94

R0 in a time-dependent (TD) fashion. All estimates of R 0 require a knowledge of serial interval,

95

the time difference between onset of symptoms in an infector and an infectee. We assumed a

96

gamma distributed serial interval with a mean of 3.96 days and a standard deviation of 4.75 days

97

as reported by Du et al.13 We used the R package R0 14 to derive all the estimates of R0. Finally,

98

we considered the possibility of biased estimates of R 0 owing to the relative lack of testing

99

facilities, especially during the initial period of the epidemic. For this, we used the method of

Lachmann et al15 that considers South Korea as the reference country and estimates the degree of

101

undertesting by combining demographic and vital statistics data. Using this method, we derived

102

the possible undertesting on each study day.

103

Statistical analysis: Our analyses used estimates of R0 as the dependent variable and the

104

geo-meteorological and socio-behavioral characteristics as the explanatory variables. To

105

compare groupwise means we used the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test as

106

appropriate. Significance of heterogeneity across study locations was statistically tested using the

107

Q test. Time series data were smoothed using a five-day sliding window technique. Further, to

108

make the different time series (each meteorological characteristic) comparable, we converted

109

them to a series of z-scores. To test the temporal concurrence, we used the cross-correlation

110

between two time series (Pearson’s correlation). To test the association of time series variables

111

with estimated time dependent R0, we used multivariable, ordinary least squares regression.

112

Starting with the full model, we conducted stepwise, backward elimination regression modeling

113

with a probability retention criterion of 0.05. Lastly, to quantify the relative contribution of each

114

covariate with time dependent R0, we estimated the proportional reduction in error (PRE) using

115

the approach of Judd, McCleland and Ryan.16 PRE was estimated as reduction in the residual

116

sum of squares by including a covariate in the full model. Statistical analyses were conducted

117

using the Stata 14.2 statistical package (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Type 1 error rate of

118

0.05 was used for hypothesis testing.

these locations and the geographic and demographic details for these locations are provided in

123

Supplementary Table 1. The study locations varied widely in terms of the area (range 4.86 –

124

6039 sq. miles), elevation (range 3 – 11500 feet above sea level) and population density (range

125

33.6 to 56812.3/sq. mile). The selected locations are distributed across India and represent

126

majority of the states / union territories of India. Meteorological data was available on all the

127

selected study locations.

128

The cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases (till and including May 31, 2020)

129

reported from these locations also varied widely (1 to 37666). The 46 selected locations together

130

accounted for a total of 108,308 confirmed COVID-19 cases. From entire India the number of

131

cumulative COVID-19 cases till May 31, 2020 were 182,140. Thus, our selected geographic

132

locations accounted for ~60% of all India COVID-19 cases till May 31, 2020. The top 5

133

contributing locations to the overall cumulative COVID-19 case counts were Mumbai (37666),

134

Delhi (18058), Chennai (12040), Ahmedabad (11919) and Pune (7459) as shown in

135

Supplementary Figure 1.

136

Average estimated R0 for COVID-19: We first estimated the R0 based on case counts

137

reported for the entire country as well as only for the locations included in this study. For each of

138

these datasets, we estimated the R0 in two ways – first based on the actual reported case counts

139

and second by inflating the case counts to account for the potential undertesting on each day. The

140

results of these analyses are shown in Figure 2 and referred to as unadjusted (actual case counts,

141

blue bars) and adjusted (for potential undertesting, purple bars). Our average estimates of R0

142

using different methods of estimation and with or without adjusting for undertesting ranged from

143

1.18 to 1.27 for India and 1.15 to 1.28 for the selected study locations. All the estimates and their

144

95% confidence intervals (error bars in Figure 2) were significantly above unity. These results

145

indicated that over the study period, the average estimates of R 0 were significantly greater than

146

one, confirming the existence of the epidemic; the average R0 estimates were only moderately

147

above unity; the average R0 estimates were minimally influenced by potential undertesting; and

148

that the study locations yielded average R0 estimates consistent with those for the whole country

149

thereby indirectly reaffirming the representativeness of the selected study locations.

150

We also examined the heterogeneity of the average R 0 estimates across the study

151

locations. For these analyses, we restricted the locations which showed at least seven consecutive

152

days with a contiguous segment of non-zero cases. Total of 35 locations were eligible based on

153

this criterion. The average R0 estimates derived using the ML method [point estimates and

154

confidence intervals (CI)] for these 35 locations are shown in Figure 3. There was a significant

155

heterogeneity in the average R0 estimates (p = 6.9x10 -30) with estimates ranging from 1.98 for

156

Dehradun to 0.89 for Kolkata. The average R 0 estimates for the top five contributing locations

157

were: Mumbai 1.16 (95% CI 1.14 – 1.18); Delhi 1.25 (95% CI 1.23 – 1.28); Chennai 1.20 (95%

158

CI 1.17 – 1.23); Ahmedabad 1.10 (95% CI 1.07 – 1.13) and Pune 1.22 (95% CI 1.18 – 1.26).

159

Temporal changes in R0 estimates: Next, we considered the variability in R0 estimates

160

over the duration of the study for all locations together. Figure 4 shows that the R0 estimates

161

were initially high but undulated widely and gradually converged towards the overall estimates

162

shown in Figure 2 with narrow confidence bands later. Thus, the time dependent R0 estimates

163

showed considerable variation across study time.

164

We examined the association of the time-dependent R0 estimates with two socio-

165

behavioral characteristics – implementation of a countrywide lockdown and the extent of social

166

distancing as reflected by the cellphone mobility data. When contrasted against the various

167

phases of countrywide lockdown in India (grey shaded regions in Figure 4), we found that the

168

median R0 estimates consistently reduced as lockdown was imposed. Before lockdown began

169

(March 1 through March 24, 2020) the median R 0 estimate was 1.54 and this estimate decreased

170

to 1.40 (March 25 – April 14, 2020), 1.21 (April 15 – May 3, 2020), 1.16 (May 4 – May 17,

171

2020) and 1.10 (May 18, 2020 onwards) during lockdown phases 1 through 4, respectively

172

(Kruskal-Wallis p <0.0001).

173

The cellphone-based community mobility data also revealed consistent and interesting

174

patterns. As shown in Supplementary Figure 2, the overall trends in community mobility for all

175

five destinations showed a dramatic decrease around the beginning of phase 1 lockdown,

176

remained very low during phase 1 lockdown and then gradually increased as the lockdown

177

progressed. The 5-day rolling z-scores for the average mobility based on these five parameters is

178

shown in Figure 4 (green curve).

179

Association of time dependent estimates with meteorological data: The time trends

180

for temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed and rainfall are shown in Figure

181

5A.Over the duration of the study, temperature and wind speed steadily increased; relative

182

humidity and air pressure gradually decreased while rainfall remained steady. As a first step of

183

the association analyses, we estimated the cross-correlation between each meteorological

184

variable and the R0 estimates. Figure 5B shows the cross-correlograms for lags ranging from -10

185

to 10 days. We found that higher temperature, wind speed and rainfall were correlated inversely

186

while relative humidity and air pressure were correlated positively with time dependent R 0

187

estimates. The best cross-correlation was observed for temperature and humidity on the same day

188

(-0.73 and 0.63, respectively), wind speed on previous day (-0.40), rainfall preceding by 4 days

189

(-0.29) and air pressure preceding by 6 days (0.54). Together these results indicated that

190

concurrent or immediately preceding values of meteorological variables are significantly

191

correlated with time dependent R0 estimates.

192

Multivariable association of meteorological and socio-behavioral predictors with

193

time dependent R0: We then examined whether the meteorological and socio-behavioral

194

covariates were independently associated with time dependent R 0 estimates. The full regression

195

model used time dependent R0 estimates as the dependent variable and following 14 covariates

196

as explanatory variables: five z-scores for the meteorological covariates, five z-scores for

197

community mobility data and four phases of lockdown (each used as a dichotomous variable).

198

The results of these analyses are shown in Table 1. In the full model, we observed that the

199

lockdown phases 3 (only marginally) and 4 and wind speed were the only covariates that were

200

statistically significantly associated with R0 estimates. In this context, the mobility data (which

201

was highly correlated with the lockdown phases) did not retain statistical significance. However,

202

considering the potential for interactions among covariates and the possibility of an

203

underpowered full model (14 covariates observed on 92 days), we conducted stepwise regression

204

modeling with a probability retention criterion of 0.05. The results of the final model (Table 1)

205

showed that temperature z-scores, wind speed and lockdown phases 2-4 were retained in the

206

final model. This model fitted the data well with an adjusted R 2 of 0.56 (Supplementary Figure

207

3)

208
209

From the point of public health relevance, we then quantified the contribution of each
variable retained in the final model to the overall variance of time dependent R 0. The PRE

210

estimates for the variables retained in the final model were as follows: temperature: 9.1%, wind

211

speed: 9.9%, lockdown phase 2: 12.2%, lockdown phase 3: 22.5% and lockdown phase 4:

212

27.0%. These results indicate that while the meteorological factors of temperature and wind

213

speed were statistically significant predictors of COVID-19 transmissibility, their contribution to

214

dampening the R0 estimate was 3-4 times weaker as compared to the countrywide lockdown

215

phases 2-4.

216

DISCUSSION

217

Using nationwide data from India over a three-month period, our study made three

218

cardinal observations. First, the average basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 infection in

219

the period from March 1 through May 31, 2020 ranged from 1.15 to 1.28 even after accounting

220

for the potential undertesting. Second, the COVID-19 transmissibility (quantified using R0) was

221

significantly associated with daily average temperature (inversely), daily average wind speed

222

(positively) and the countrywide intervention of lockdown (inversely). Third, the contribution of

223

lockdown to the variability in time dependent R 0 was three times more than the contribution of

224

temperature and wind speed combined. Together, these results suggest that in India while the

225

meteorological determinants of COVID-19 were independently associated with the

226

transmissibility, their contribution was outweighed by that of the countrywide lockdown.

227

Even though statistically significantly greater than unity, our estimate of R 0 was low.

228

This estimate is comparable to the value of 1.32 reported by Du et al. However, the low value of

229

R0 should be interpreted with caution. First, there has been a debate about the length of serial

230

interval with values ranging from as low as 3 days to as high as 9 days.13, 17-21 We used the serial

231

interval of ~4 days which is on the lower side of the serial interval range and could have partly

232

contributed to the low R0 observed in this study. Second, the major part of the study period

233

included lockdown and reduced mobility and therefore the R 0 estimate may represent a muted

234

transmissibility owing to interventions in place. Third, the low R 0 estimate does not indicate lack

235

of viral infectiousness or any other viral characteristic but only implies the extent of potential

236

spread of the disease.22 Fourth, the epidemic of COVID-19 is still ongoing and our estimate of R0

237

only captures the initial, ascending limb of the epidemic curve. Therefore, this R 0 estimate does

238

not fully capture the population dynamics of COVID-19. Fifth, our estimate of R0 is a

239

conglomerate of the varying estimates across the study locations as shown in Figure 3. The

240

variability in R0 across study locations indicates that the location-specific epidemic curves were

241

not aligned to the same starting point in time and therefore our R0 estimate should not be used as

242

a generalizable estimate of COVID-19 transmissibility. The reason for estimating R 0 in the study

243

was to investigate the potential influence of geo-meteorological factors on transmissibility.

244

Several researchers around the world have demonstrated an inverse relationship between

245

air temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility.23-27 Our results also are in agreement with the

246

general understanding that higher ambient temperature can inversely influence COVID-19

247

transmissibility.23, 27 The study duration mark a period of increasing temperature in the Indian

248

peninsula and our results indicate that, in general, high ambient temperatures were associated

249

with lower R0 estimates such that unit standard deviation increase in air temperature was

250

associated with a 0.08 lower R0 (Table 1, final model).On the other hand, we observed that a unit

251

standard deviation increase in wind speed was associated with a 0.08 higher R 0 (Table 1, final

252

model). The current evidence for the potential role of wind speed in COVID-19 spread is

253

conflicting with studies reporting positive,28 null29-31 and negative1, 32 association with COVID-

254

19 transmissibility. Our observation of a positive association of COVID-19 transmissibility with

wind speed is in line with the growing idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be airborne.33, 34 Of

256

note, incidence of COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with air pollution 1, 35, 36 – a factor

257

that is significantly influenced by wind speed.37 Our study cannot directly answer these

interesting hypotheses, which should be tested in future studies. Nevertheless, a head-to-head

259

comparison indicated that the lockdown period was associated with three times stronger

260

contribution to the variability in R0 as compared to that of air temperature and wind speed

261

combined. From the perspective of public health action, this observation supports the role of

262

proactive interventions to de-escalate the transmissibility of COVID-19. Conceivably, as the

263

temperatures wane and the lockdown is eased, more cases of COVID-19 can be expected.

264

Our results should be interpreted in the light of some limitations. First, this was a

265

retrospective analysis that combined data from different sources. The data are collected at the

266

level of geographic locations and not at the level of individual patient. For example, person-to-

267

person transmissibility of COVID-19 in an infector-infectee scenario was not investigated in this

268

study. Therefore, all the estimates and associations should only be considered as general patterns

269

rather than definitive evidence. Second, akin to any observational study, unmeasured

270

confounding can be expected to be operational. Despite these potential limitations our study

271

demonstrated interesting and important patterns of association of geo-meteorological factors in

272

COVID-19 spread. To control a pandemic of this magnitude, all scientific evidence from a

273

holistic standpoint is needed. To that end, our study provides clues into the ecological aspects of

274

COVID-19 during the initial months in India.
