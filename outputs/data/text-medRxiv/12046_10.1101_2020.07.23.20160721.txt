Abstract
Introduction
The importance of integrated, people-centered health systems has been recognized as a central
component of achieving Universal Health Coverage. Integration has also been highlighted as a critical
element for building resilient health systems that can stand the shock of health emergencies. However,
there is dearth of research and systematic synthesis of evidence on the synergistic relationship between
integrated health services and pandemic preparedness in low- and low-middle income countries
(LMICs). Thus, the authors are organizing a scoping review aiming to explore application of integrated
health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs.
Methods and analysis
This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and O’Malley (2005). Peer
reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled utilizing a standardized and replicable
search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science,
CINAHL Plus, the World Health Organization’s Global Research Database on COVID-19, and LitCovid.
Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to
June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full text review by two independent
reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with
accompanying data matrixes.
Ethics and dissemination
No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June to December
2020. Results from this study will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related
to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will be
developed into reports and a peer-reviewed articles and will assist policy makers in making pragmatic
and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic response.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan, the
capital city of Hubei province in China. Sprouting from a local outbreak, COVID-19 emerged as one of the
most significant pandemics of the last century [1,2]. Within six months, over 10 million confirmed
COVID-19 cases had been detected worldwide with over 500 thousand deaths [3]. The COVID-19
pandemic has taken a toll on the health systems of emerging economies of South-east Asia, with India,
Pakistan, and Bangladesh in the top twenty countries for total cases [3].
This unprecedented pandemic has put an enormous amount of financial, administrative, and
logistical stress on the health sector [4,5], including the health systems of low and low-middle-income
countries (LMIC). Within the midst of this systemwide shock, preparedness, response, and recovery
endeavors need to be adopted by the health system to control the COVID-19 effectively [6]. These
adaptations include expanding surveillance systems to identify potential cases and contact trace, the
development of communication strategies between health systems and populations to share of credible
and accurate information, and sustaining routine health care services across settings and levels of the
health system. However, due to the often segmented and vertically organized health system in LMICs,
these adaptations often come with heavy costs in time, financial, human resources, and de-prioritization
of routine healthcare services. [7]
Integrated health service delivery system
The importance of integrated, people-centered health systems was globally affirmed in 2016
with an adopted resolution of the sixty-ninth World Health Assembly [8] and is increasingly recognized
as a central component of achieving Universal Health Coverage [9]. This research adopts the definition
of integrated health service delivery (IHSD) system from the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional
Office for Europe:
“An approach to strengthen people-centered health systems through the promotion of
the comprehensive delivery of quality services across the life-course, designed according
to the multidimensional needs of the population and the individual and delivered by a
coordinated multidisciplinary team of providers working across settings and levels of
care… … with feedback loops to continuously improve performance and to tackle
upstream causes of ill health and to promote well-being through intersectoral and
multisectoral actions.” [10]
The above definition represents a comprehensive view of IHSD and captures integration from
the multiple perspectives of health systems stakeholders (patients, providers, managers, and
policymakers). Within the broad definition, four dimensions of integration are explored: organizational,
functional, service, and clinical [11]. These dimensions are summarized in Table 1, adapted from Lewis et
al. 2008 [11].

Integrated health service delivery for pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery
The World Health Organization’s 2017 guide on influenza risk management outlines four
pandemic phases [6] – (i) interpandemic, (ii) alert, (iii) pandemic, and (iv) transition, that align with three
components of risk assessment – (a) preparedness, (b) response, and (c) recovery. Literature specific to
pandemic preparedness also highlights aspects of system integration, albeit from a broader perspective
than the definition of IHSD used here.
It is possible that typologies of integration recommended to prepare and respond to a health
emergency could relate to, or even advance, broader movements towards an IHSD system. For example,
a coordinated approach – including comprehensive risk management, multidisciplinary health sector
collaboration, and building community resilience – is recommended for emergency management [6].
This requires planning to surge capacity, developing triage systems, managing the continuity of essential
health services, and prevention of secondary effects are emphasized for pandemic preparedness [6]. It is
highly likely that integration across the components of health systems, levels of care, and across types of
providers will prove necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The interdependency between the IHSD system and pandemic preparedness is especially
pertinent in LMICs. The surge of infection related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) spared the LMICs in the early stages of the pandemic. However, as COVID-19 incidence is
increasing rapidly through developing countries like India, the pandemic has drawn attention towards
the required integration of a range of health services and supply chains that are often under-resourced
in LMICs, such as ambulatory care, mental health services, and oxygen provision. Historically health
systems in the LMICs were structured and sustained as vertical and disease-focused, and we
acknowledge that significant success were achieved. However, the same fragmentation in the health
system could create challenges to the coordinated pandemic preparedness, response, and recovery
effort against COVID-19.
Bolstered by the 40th anniversary of the Alma Alta Declaration and the movement towards
Universal Health Coverage, many LMIC health systems have moved away from a vertical disease focus
towards IHSD approaches [12,13]. This shift has also been increasingly advocated by bilateral and
multilateral donor agencies and international organizations as a means to respond to the changing
burden of disease (from infectious to non-communicable diseases), improve people-centeredness, and

increase efficiency [12–14]. This review can identify any emerging evidence on where integrated care
has improved health systems outcomes during COVID-19 in LMICs and provide guidance on the further
testing of emerging approaches.
RATIONALE OF THE REVIEW
The importance of integration (OR harmonization OR coordination) – both within the health
delivery system and between public health and health services delivery systems – has been highlighted
as key to building resilient health systems that can respond to health emergencies [15–17]. Each of
these aspects could potentially relate to, or be strengthened by, IHSD systems, but this explicit linkage
appears under-addressed by existing literature. This study aims to explore the evidence and application
of integrated health service delivery across the pandemic phases and risk assessment components in
LMICs using a scoping review methodology.
Scientific research related to COVID-19 is emerging as rapidly as the pace of the pandemic itself
[18,19] (Figure 1). We can assume that the evidence for the IHSD system during the COVID-19 pandemic
is rapidly evolving as the epidemiologic profile and disease burden changes worldwide. Moreover, there
is an acute lack of exploration of the published evidence focusing on the application of integrated health
service delivery in LMICs. Thus, a scoping review is an appropriate design to map existing literature,
summarize it, and identify gaps [20]. Scoping studies are also appropriate to contextualize existing
knowledge and gaps within a policy and practice context [21].
Exploring IHSD within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to
examine whether LMICs are utilizing integrated approaches in response to an external shock to their
health system, what approach(es) are being used, and what recommendations are emerging. The review
will also identify any emerging evidence on where integrated care has improved health systems
outcomes during COVID-19 in LMIC settings and provide guidance on the adoption of various typologies.
This scoping review will enable a mapping of the evidence from published literature as it relates to the
IHSD system. Results from this study will be disseminated to support policy makers and practitioners in
LMICs to support pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic response.
OBJECTIVES
Aligning with the aim of the overarching aim of this study, this scoping review has three objectives:
1. Investigating the characteristics of the IHSD system commonly appearing in the COVID-19
literature generated from LMICs
2. Exploring the operational approaches of IHSD being utilized during COVID-19 preparedness,
response, and recovery within the health systems of LMICs
3. Identifying the emerging recommendations on the IHSD system for pandemic preparedness,
response, and recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic from LMICs
METHODS AND ANALYSIS
The methodology for this scoping review follows Arksey and O’Malley’s six stages for scoping
reviews [20] and adheres to the checklist of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses’ Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [22,23]. An overview of each stage of the
review follows.

Stage one: conceptualizing research question
The overarching research question leading this scoping review is: How are the health systems of
LMICs utilizing IHSD approaches to prepare for and/or respond to the COVID-19 pandemic? This research
question aligns itself with the research objective mentioned in the above section.
Stage two: identification of relevant literature
Followed by the development of the research objective, a comprehensive and replicable
literature search strategy is being structured to extract the references of the relevant peer reviewed
articles from literature repositories (Table 2). To implement this process, first, the research team has
identified key literature from PubMed and Google Scholar to select keyword and index terms and
develop the search terms. Next, using the keywords and search terms, the study will conduct a
comprehensive search across seven electronic databases.

The search strategy of the electronic database consists of four concepts: (i) Integrated care, (ii)
pandemic preparedness, (iii) COVID-19, and (iv) names of the countries belong to the low- and lowmiddle-income group according to the World Bank Classification [24]. Using these concepts, the initial
search strategy developed for PubMed generated only 15 records published between 01 December
2019 to 22 April 2020 (Search conducted on 22 April 2020). The proposed search strategy is presented in
Table 3 and detailed in the supplementary material of this protocol.

The World Bank developed the list of low-income economies and the lower-middle-income economies according to
the World Bank Atlas method using GNI per capita.
(https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378832-what-is-the-world-bank-atlas-method)
Low-income economies = GNI per capita $1,025 or less in 2018
Lower middle-income economies = GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995 in 2018

As the literature on COVID-19 is rapidly changing, a brief title and abstract scan was conducted
to review the performance of the search strategy. Upon this brief review, the research team concluded
that few articles were published from LMICs until 22 April 2020. Thus, a decision was taken to conduct a
second round of literature search on 12 June 2020. The second implementation of the search strategy in
PubMed generated 92 records, published between 01 December 2019 to 12 June 2020 (Search
conducted on 12 June 2020).
After implementing the search strategy in all seven databases, the title and abstracts will be
downloaded, and citations will be imported into Covidence systematic review software (covidence.org).
At this stage, we will remove the duplicates and organize the search records to review their titles and
abstracts.
Stage three: study selection
During the third stage, all input articles will be screened utilizing the pre-determined inclusion
and exclusion criteria found in Table 3. In line with Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework for
scoping reviews, the inclusion and exclusion criteria represent a broad view of the subject, and the
evidence characteristics may be satisfied by a range of study designs and methodologies [20].

Two independent reviewers will screen the title and abstract of each imported document
against the Table 4 criteria, and any conflicting recommendations will be reviewed and adjudicated by a
third reviewer for consistency. Next, the full text of the initially selected articles will be screened using
the same criteria by two independent reviewers, followed by review and adjudication of conflicting
recommendations by the third reviewer. As scoping reviews are often iterative [20,25], any suggested
modifications to the inclusion or exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the entire research team with the
senior member making final decisions regarding necessary modifications. If changes to the criteria are
agreed upon, all previously excluded documents will be re-screened to ensure appropriate inclusion or
exclusion against the modified criteria.
Stage four: charting data
Eligible articles from the full-text review will be re-examined, and the relevant data from the
articles will be charted using a data extraction form. Table 5 provides an overview of the initial overview
of data elements, which will be extracted for the study (see the supplementary materials for the full
extraction form and overview of terms).

Stage five: reporting the results
Charted information will be analyzed thematically and reported in a narrative format using
tables and figures. Per standardized methodology for scoping reviews, the quality of evidence will not be
assessed during the reporting process [20]. Data displays and matrixes will be utilized to explore aspects
of integration vis a vis the risk assessment phases of pandemic response. Dedoose (dedoose.com) will be
utilized to explore clusters of findings geographically and across phases of pandemic response.
Stage six: expert consultation
Expert consultation is an optional stage proposed by Arksey and O’Malley [20]. We believe that
there is an inherent value of the expert consultation to translate the findings of this scoping review.
Though we intend to perform a brief expert consultation, implementation of this stage will be based on
the feasibility and progression of the scoping review.
The potential roster of experts can be developed from the Department of International Health
of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH), Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security
(JHCHS) and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Gmbh.
