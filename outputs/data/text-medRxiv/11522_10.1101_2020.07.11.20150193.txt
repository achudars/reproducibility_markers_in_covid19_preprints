Abstract

Introduction: Although lockdown measures to stop COVID-19 have direct effects on disease
transmission, their impact on violent and accidental deaths remains unknown. Our study aims to
assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru.
Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted
time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of
COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic
accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days.
Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest
drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men
per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25,
-2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide
reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during
the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No
other change in slope was detected.
Conclusions: Violent and accidental deaths presented a sudden drop after the lockdown was
implemented and an increase in suicide in men was observed. Falls in mobility have a natural
impact on traffic accidents, however, the patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive and
reveal important characteristics of these events, although we expect all of these changes to be
transient.

Introduction

2
3

COVID-19 has had a serious impact on population health worldwide 1, not only as a direct

4

consequence of the infection but also due to the measures taken to reduce its transmission. These

5

unprecedented changes in the lifestyles of millions have also impacted mental health, society and

6

economy in various ways 2,3.

7
8

The main strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission are social distancing and isolation

9

measures. Policies range from advising individuals to keep apart a physical distance (i.e. 2

10

meters) in public spaces all the way to generalized lockdowns 4, all to reduce the pace of

11

transmission and to prevent health services from being overwhelmed 5.

12
13

By the middle of June 2020, Latin-America had become a focus of COVID-19 infection. To slow

14

the spread, most of the countries in the region have taken severe lockdown measures 6. Peru was

15

one of the countries with the earliest and strictest national lockdown measures in Latin-America

16

and has won international recognition for its pandemic response, starting restrictions right after

17

the first confirmed case in mid-March 2020 and lasting for over 100 days until the end of June in

18

most of the national territory 6–9.

19
20

Although measures such as national lockdowns are expected to have a direct impact on

21

transmission and subsequent mortality due to COVID-19 infection10–12, their interruption of all

22

daily activities suggest that they may also impact other aspects of health and causes of death 13–15.

23

Radical changes in the daily activities of individuals, self-isolation, financial uncertainty, job

24

losses, and reduced incomes have the potential to influence mortality due to violent crimes,

25

suicides, domestic violence, and other external causes of death 16–19.

26
27

Early reports have indicated a substantial drop in violent crime rates across the world, with an

28

overall drop in crime close 50% in some cities following some of the most restrictive measures

29

20,21

30

measures came into effect, as victims are forced to be isolated with their abusers22,23. The UN has

31

estimated that domestic violence has increased by over 30% in some countries since lockdown

32

with a surge in the need for shelters24,25.

. At the same time, reports of domestic violence have increased since social distancing

33
34

Lockdowns have also been accompanied by travel bans and a reduction in mobility, leading to a

35

decrease in the use of motor vehicles use26 with a consequential drop in traffic accidents and

36

resultant emergency visits and deaths27,28. The mental health effects of COVID-19 and of the

37

accompanying economic crisis have also been profound, with suicide as a concern16. Previous

38

pandemic scenarios have also shown a change in suicide trends including the 1918 influenza

39

pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic29,30.

40
41

Although by the end June 2020 most countries have relaxed their lockdown measures, their

42

diverse consequences are still unclear and are just now beginning to be studied empirically. Our

43

study aims to assess the early impact of the COVID-19 national lockdown on homicide, suicide,

44

and traffic accident deaths in the Peruvian setting.

Study population

49
50

We used data from the Peruvian National Death Information System (SINADEF)31 which

51

collects daily death certificates nationwide with available data since 2017. SINADEF has

52

improved the quality of data registration in the recent years, managing to improve its coverage

53

and represents close to 80% of all deaths in the national territory32. For this study, we have

54

included nationwide information on deceased adults (18 years old or older) from January 1st,

55

2017 to June 28th, 2020.

56
57

On March 16, 2020, the Peruvian government decreed a state of sanitary emergency, suspending

58

economic, academic, and recreational activities across the entire country of 32 million people.

59

Only essential activities including food supply, pharmacies, and banking remained active.

60

Moreover, international borders were closed, military and police patrolled the streets, and a

61

curfew was instituted from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Public transport capacity was also reduced by half

62

and movement between regions within the country was banned. Although some of the

63

components of the lockdown have changed throughout its implementation, the core aspects of the

64

lockdown remained constant until the end of June 2020 7,8.

65
66

Measures

67
68

Because the lockdown was implemented in the middle of March and there is a relatively low

69

count of daily deaths, we chose to aggregate the data in bins of 15 days each to have a uniform

70

time unit throughout our study period.

72

Violent and accidental death information, sex, and age were taken directly from the SINADEF

73

report. This report has an independent item for violent forms of deaths including homicide,

74

suicide, traffic accidents, and other types of accidental deaths. This information is recorded by the

75

health worker that certifies the death. The number of events was transformed into the rate per

76

1,000,000 population for better comparison based on the population report from the latest

77

National Census33.

78
79

Because the COVID-19 pandemic imposes additional stress on health workers and the health

80

system, the reporting, recording, and coding of deaths could be affected by this overload of

81

work34,35. To estimate if violent deaths recording was affected by this scenario, we also estimated

82

the proportion of violent deaths labeled as “unspecified” as a proportion of the total violent

83

deaths. This fraction was assessed in the same way as the main outcomes to find any change in

84

the trends after lockdown.

85
86

To have a measure of the degree of compliance with lockdown and an approximation to the use

87

of motor vehicles we used descriptive data from the mobile-phone mobility data provided by

88

Google Community Mobility Reports for public transit places36. This report presents the percent

89

change in visits to transport places for each day compared to a baseline value for that day of the

90

week.

91
92

Statistical analysis

93
94

To assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown, we analyzed

95

the violent death rates per population using an interrupted time series analysis37. A linear

96

regression model was fitted to the violent deaths rates with a time variable (every 15 days), a

97

variable to indicate post-lockdown, which was defined since March 16, 2020, and an interaction

98

term between the post-lockdown indicator and the time variable, to evaluate a change in the slope

99

of the outcome trend after lockdown. Stratified analysis was performed for women and men

100

because of known differences in violent deaths by sex. Autocorrelation of the time series was

101

assessed through a correlogram and seasonality through visual inspection of the plots. The

102

analysis was conducted using R 3.6.1.

103
104

Results

105
106

A total of 388,772 events were identified as adult deaths from January 1st, 2017 to June 28th,

107

2020. Violent and accidental deaths sum up to 14,526 including 6,700 traffic accidents, 2,849

108

homicides, 1,611 suicides, and 3,366 other forms of accidental deaths. No autocorrelation or

109

seasonality was found in any time series because the entire follow-up period spanned only 3.5

110

months.

111
112

The time slope in the pre-lockdown period was positive for all types of violent deaths in both sex

113

groups with the highest for male traffic accidents, with an extra 0.75 deaths per year per million

114

men (95%CI: 0.51, 0.99) and the lowest in female homicides, with an extra 0.10 deaths per year

115

per million women (95%CI: 0.04, 0.16). All forms of violent and accidental deaths presented a

116

sudden drop after the implementation of the lockdown in both groups. The biggest difference in

117

the post-lockdown period was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66

118

deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and a reduction of 3.64 deaths per

119

million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03) after the lockdown. Homicide and suicide

120

presented a similar level drop in women with around 1 fewer death per million women per

121

month, while the homicide reduction was twice the suicide reduction in men with 6 and 3 drops

122

in deaths per million men per month respectively. Other forms of accidental deaths in women

123

presented a reduction of 2 deaths per million women per month, being the second-highest drop in

124

this group (Table 1). We detected an increase in the slope of suicides in men in the post-

125

lockdown period with an extra 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95%CI: 0.06, 7.18) from the

126

pre-lockdown period slope. No other change in the post-lockdown slope compared to the pre-

127

lockdown period was found in the other types of violent or accidental death in women (Figure 1)

128

or men (Figure 2). The post-lockdown follow-up is short and so there is low power to detect a

129

slope change among these points38.

130
131

There was no change in the level or the trend of the unspecified violent death proportion (Figure

132

3A). The mobility data (Figure 3B) shows an early drop in mobility to transit stations right after

133

the first confirmed case with a gradual reduction until the start of the lockdown. After lockdown,

134

the mobility fell below -75% after the second day and held constant at around -80% for 40 days.

135

After that period, mobility gradually recovered, with an increasing tendency through the end of

136

the lockdown. The episodic drops shown close to -100% represent the strict curfew on Sundays

137

and holidays.

138
139

Discussion

140
141

In this nationwide time series analysis, we found that lockdown implementation was associated

142

with a sudden reduction in all major forms of violent and accidental deaths (homicides, suicides

143

and traffic accidents represented 79% of total violent and accidental deaths in 201939) with a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.11.20150193; this version posted July 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

9
144

detected change in the post-lockdown trend of suicides in men. Nonetheless, we do expect rates

145

to return to their pre-pandemic levels at some future point. The biggest immediate absolute

146

reduction was seen in traffic accidents and the smallest in suicides, but of course this also reflects

147

the higher absolute burden of traffic accidents as a cause of death.

148
149

These results are consistent with both the theoretical rationale behind lockdown and various early

150

reports in other parts of the world. The change in lifestyle and behaviors associated with limited

151

outside activities and economic shutdown must certainly play a role in the mechanism behind the

152

acute change in the rates of these types of deaths. Falls in mobility have a natural impact on road

153

traffic accidents, since people staying at home are at no risk for these events. The decreases in

154

suicide and homicide are less obvious. Suicide might be expected to increase from economic and

155

social stress and the disruption of daily routine40,41.

156
157

Expectations about homicide are also not so clear. As lockdown measures began, conventional

158

crimes began to slow down around the world. Studies that evaluated the short-term effects of

159

lockdown on different types of crime reports in Los Angeles and Indianapolis in the USA found a

160

marked decrease in the robbery, burglary, and aggravated assault after the stay-at-home measures

161

took place18,42.

162
163

Most homicides in men in Latin-America and around the world are associated with crime43,44, and

164

since lockdown, both murder and crime decreased in the region45. In Mexico, murder rates, which

165

started at a historic high in 2020, dropped dramatically almost halfway from the national average

166

of 81 per day to 54 after social distancing measures were put in place46 and a similar pattern has

167

been seen in other countries in the region. Although there is an initial drop and sustained low

10
168

crime rate while in lockdown, a greater change is expected once lifted due to economic

169

uncertainty. In our time series analysis, we also found a marked dropped in homicides after

170

lockdown. Although this aligns with most reports in the region, this decrease in homicides

171

contrasts with what is happening in some cities in the USA where crime is down, but murder is

172

up, without a clear explanation of this divergence 47. Now in the post-lockdown period of our

173

time series there is already the first hint of a subtle increase in the rates of homicides.

174
175

Most homicides in men are associated with crime, however, most homicides in women are hate

176

crimes or feminicides. In Peru, the first cause of homicide in women is intimate partner violence,

177

with 1 of every 5 women having the partner as the perpetrator 48. Lockdown and isolation

178

measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have created greater risks for women living in

179

situations of domestic violence23,24,49. Although we found a reduction in women’s homicides

180

overall, this does not exclude the increase in other forms of intimate partner violence, rather, it

181

reflects the conditions in which femicides occur. According to a study carried out in autopsies of

182

women victims of violence, the most frequent place where the body was found was in public

183

places, rivers, or open fields (43.4%), compared to the home (22.9%)50. Lockdown restrictions

184

may have imposed an additional barrier in the occurrence of these tragic acts as police and

185

military were constantly watching the streets.

186
187

Mental health during lockdown has also been a constant concern13,15,16,51,52. Some initial reports

188

show the increase in suicides rate during this pandemic as a consequence of lockdown, financial

189

stress, uncertainty, and isolation52,53. Two possible projection scenarios based on an increase in

190

unemployment in Canada following the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a projected total of 11.6

191

to 13.6 excess suicides in 2020-2021 per 100 00054. Our results show that after lockdown the

11
192

immediate rate of suicides declined, however, men presented a detectable increase in the slope of

193

suicides in the post-lockdown period. One of the factors may be the shutdown of the economic

194

activities and the financial stress during the post-lockdown period. Nearly 81% of men in Peru

195

have a paid job compare to 64% women55, and during the pandemic, the male working population

196

in the country capital decreased by 47.3% and the female working population by 48.1%56. These

197

initial changes in suicide trends may give us an idea of what might come next as a result of these

198

social changes.

199
200

Traffic accidents were the type of violent death that decreased the most and this observation is

201

consistent with many of the specific restrictions adopted, including the general limit of transit as

202

well as the imposition of strict curfews at night and on Sundays. Other countries have also seen a

203

decline in emergency room visits for trauma injuries related to traffic accidents after the

204

lockdown28,57.

205
206

An increasing rate towards the end of the lockdown is more apparent for traffic accidents than for

207

other types of death. This mirrors quite closely the changes observed in mobility trends. Both,

208

traffic accident deaths and the mobility change present as U-shaped trends during lockdown,

209

demonstrating that the lockdown measures were not fully adopted at the beginning and that they

210

eased gradually towards the end. Other forms of violent death have also shown a decline and

211

even appear to be in decline after the lockdown, however, as economic activities resume, this rate

212

may recover the baseline level as with the other types of death.

213
214

This report constitutes an initial analysis of the trends in violent deaths and as such, we recognize

215

some limitations. Although we found that there was no major change in the occurrence of deaths

12
216

coded as “unknown” cause, after lockdown, underreporting may be possible for other coding

217

variables. This is a nationwide analysis and some differences by region may not be captured. Peru

218

has tremendous diversity of lifestyle between coastal, mountain and jungle regions, and data

219

come from large cities and small rural communities with radically different rates of events.

220

Competing risk due to COVID-19 is also a possibility although most of the violent deaths occur

221

in the younger population, and not necessarily in the population at risk of dying because of

222

COVID-19. For suicide, however, the populations may overlap to a greater extent58. Our analysis

223

only considers the beginning and end of the lockdown thus the sudden initial drop that we have

224

described may be accompanied by a sudden increase after the measures are lifted and a later

225

follow-up analysis would be informative.

226
227

There is an urgency to consider and understand the myriad indirect mortality consequences of the

228

policies adopted to respond to COVID-19. It is expected that some time after the lockdowns are

229

completely lifted around the world, the lives lost from the impacts of these various policies on the

230

economy, lifestyle, and mental health will outweigh the number of lives lost directly from

231

infection. Indicators of this broad impact, including the types of violent and accidental deaths

232

studied here, will be crucial for future decision-making59.

233
234

Conclusions

235
236

Lockdown due to COVID-19 has impacted the rates of violent and accidental deaths, showing a

237

sudden drop after its implementation and an increase in the slope of suicide in men in the post-

238

lockdown period. The biggest change was seen in deaths as a consequence of traffic accidents.

13
239

This initial drop should not be considered as encouraging, since just as there was a marked drop

240

at the beginning, it is likely to be an equally sharp increase after the lockdown is lifted and the

241

economic activities are resumed. The patterns for suicide and homicide are less intuitive,

242

however, and reveal important clues about the causes and characteristics of these events. Policies

243

should take into consideration other aspects of health that might be overlooked during this

244

pandemic.
