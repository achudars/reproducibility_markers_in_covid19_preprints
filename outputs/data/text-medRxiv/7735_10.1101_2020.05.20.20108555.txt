Abstract

Background: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and renin–angiotensin system

(RAS) blockade are reported to affect the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019

(COVID-19) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the effectiveness of

these drugs in large populations is unclear.

Subjects and Methods: As of May 2020, data analysis was conducted on all subjects

who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health

Review and Assessment Service database in Korea. Using the COVID-19 and

claims data of the past 5 years, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19

infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade.

Results: Totally, data of 67850 subjects were accessible. Of these, 5080 were

confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis

in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and

RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive

care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was

0.362 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.135–0.971], and that for RAS blockade users

drugs.

is

significantly

associated with a better clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, the

Introduction

People with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM)

and hypertension

have a

higher risk

of COVID-19 infection

than the general

population and generally exhibit poor prognosis1-5. There is an urgent need to

develop evidence-based treatment methods to effectively prevent and manage

COVID-19 in people with chronic diseases. However, it is not easy to provide reliable

evidence within a short period in a worldwide pandemic situation.

Recently,

it

has

been

suggested

that

dipeptidyl

peptidase-4

(DPP-4)

and

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be parts of the receptor proteins of

the novel coronavirus and may have a significant impact on the clinical course of

COVID-196,7. Their molecular pathways are well-known to play important roles in

glucose homeostasis, cardiovascular hemodynamics, and physiologic responses

associated with inflammatory cascades 8-12. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) and

renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockade, which are widely used in general practice,

are likely to have a significant impact on the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients

with chronic diseases13,14.

The evidence that DPP-4i and RAS blockade significantly affect the clinical course of

COVID-19 infection is unclear. Therefore, it is generally recommended that COVID-

19 patients with chronic diseases either not use or discontinue these drugs 15.

However, the clinical significance of DPP-4i and RAS blockade for COVID-19 in the

absence of effective treatment or preventive measures other than symptomatic

treatment can be very important.

Hence, we utilized the entire claims data related to COVID-19 from Korea's national

medical insurance database, and investigated the effects of DPP-4i and RAS

blockade, which are commonly administered to patients with DM, on the short-term

clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

The Korean national health insurance is a single healthcare insurance system that

covers approximately 97% of the total Korean population; the remaining 3% are

“medical protection” beneficiaries. Information on individuals’ utilization of medical

facilities, prescription records, and diagnostic codes configured in the format of

International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) is recorded in the

HIRA

database16.

This

database

is

considered

representative

of

the

Korean

population and is used in research through anonymization and de-identification.

Study subjects

Currently, in Korea, medication usage data for the past 5 years for those who have

claimed a confirmatory test of COVID-19 are managed as a separate database for

research. To protect personal information, the export of raw data is strictly prohibited

by law, and research is being performed in a way that provides de-identified results

when researchers submit program codes for analysis 17. As of May 17, 2020, the total

number of Korean COVID-19 claims released to researchers was 67850 (Figure 1).

Of these, 5080 and 832 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19 with DM,

respectively.

Definition of COVID-19 infection, clinical status, and other clinical variables

The clinical variables that can be identified in Korea's COVID-19 claim database are

the subject's age, sex, diagnostic code, medication prescription, outpatient care,

hospitalization, critical care, and death. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as ICD-10

diagnosis codes B34.2, B97.2, U18, U18.1, or U07.x. Intensive care was defined as

a procedure code for endotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation, or the

charge of an intensive care unit management fee. We analyzed subjects according

to a mild case of self-isolation or simple hospitalization, or a severe/lethal case of

death or intensive care.

The subject's comorbidity was defined as a diagnostic code. DM was defined as

E10.x, E11.x, E12.x, E13.x, or E14.x, hypertension as I10.x, I11.x, I12.x, I13.x, or

I15.x, dyslipidemia as E78.x, cardiovascular disease as I20.x, I21.x, I22.x, I23.x,

I24.x, or I25.x, and cerebrovascular disease as I61.x, I62.x, I63.x, or I64.x. Chronic

kidney disease was defined as N18.x, asthma as J45.x or J46.x, and chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as J44.x. The subject's medication use was

assessed based on the initial date of COVID-19 diagnosis. If the prescription was

confirmed within 180 days of diagnosis and was for at least 90 days, the subject was

defined as a user of a specific drug. Thereafter, differences in characteristics and

clinical status were compared according to whether the subject used DPP-4i and/or

RAS blockade. We also investigated the possibility of synergy during the combined

use of these two drugs.

Results

Clinical characteristics with or without use of DPP-4i

Clinical characteristics of subjects were compared according to whether DPP-4i was

used (Table 1). The mean age of DPP-4i users was 63.69 ± 12.19 years, which was

significantly higher than that of non-users. Of these, males were 56.65%, which was

not significantly different from the percentage among non-users. Hypertension and

dyslipidemia were shown by 74.90% and 93.92% of the subjects, respectively. There

were no significant differences in the prevalence of other comorbidities. In terms of

medication, DPP-4i users had significantly higher rates of metformin, sulfonylurea,

thiazolidinedione, RAS blockade, diuretics, statin, and fibrate usage. However, the

usage rate of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) was significantly

higher in non-users.

cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases among them was significantly higher

than that among non-users. With regard to medication, the usage frequency of

metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP-4i, diuretic, calcium-channel blocker,

and statin was significantly higher among RAS-blockade users than among non-

users.

Differences in severity of COVID-19 infection upon use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade

The fractions of those who received intensive care or died were 3.42% and 4.39%

among DPP-4i users and non-users, respectively (Table 3). The unadjusted odds

ratio (OR) of these severe/lethal cases among DPP-4i users was 0.771 (95%

0.355–1.676).

However,

the

OR

(aOR),

considering age, sex, comorbidity, and medication, was 0.362 (95% CI, 0.135–0.971).

The fractions of those who received intensive care or died were 3.98% and 4.16%

among RAS-blockade users and non-users, respectively (Table 3). The OR of

severe/lethal cases among RAS-blockade users was 0.954 (95% CI, 0.471–1.933).

were divided into 4 groups according to whether DPP-4i and RAS blockade were

used, and further analyzed. Their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table S1

in the Supplementary Appendix.

Compared to that of subjects who used neither DPP-4i nor RAS blockade, the aOR

was 0.456 (95% CI, 0.158–1.314) for severe/lethal cases of RAS-blockade-only

users, 0.232 (95% CI, 0.057–0.954) for DPP-4i-only users, and 0.251 (95% CI,

0.074–0.850) for subjects using both DPP-4i and RAS blockade.

Discussion

In this study, we compared the characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19

infection upon administration of DPP-4i and RAS blockade, using a large database

representative of the Korean population. The aOR for severe/lethal cases of DPP-4i

users was 0.362 (95% CI, 0.135–0.971), and that for RAS-blockade users was 0.599

(95% CI, 0.251–1.431). The aOR for the subgroup of those who used both drugs

was 0.251 (95% CI, 0.074–0.850), which was not significantly different from that of

DPP-4i-only users. These results suggest that the use of DPP-4i for people with DM

is associated with a better clinical outcome of COVID-19 infection, suggesting that

the synergistic effect of the combination of these two classes of drug is not likely to

be noticeable. To our knowledge, these results are new facts that have not been

reported previously.

Our findings are consistent with the existing experimental research hypothesis that

DPP-4i may reduce the severity of COVID-19 because DPP-4 acts as a receptor for

coronavirus6,18. This hypothesis has not been confirmed in large population groups,

and our findings may be among the important evidence that supports it. In our study,

DPP-4i users were more likely to exhibit comorbidities than non-users, and thus

were more likely

to be taking medications of different classes. Despite these

differences in characteristics, it is interesting to note that the use of DPP-4i is

associated with better clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with DM. In particular,

since DPP-4i rarely causes hypoglycemia when used alone, it is necessary to

examine the possibility of this drug being used as an immunomodulator for systemic

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108555; this version posted May 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

infections, and not solely as a diabetes drug 19,20.

It should also be noted that the number of users of SGLT2i was significantly higher

among DPP-4i non-users. A large-scale clinical trial of SGLT2i has demonstrated

that this drug has a significant effect on the prevention of cardiovascular disease21,22.

Based on the results of this study, a randomized trial was recently performed to

confirm the effect of SGLT2i on COVID-19 patients23. However, SGLT2i is likely to

have a negative effect on patients with acute phase infections, for which it is

important to maintain stable hemodynamics24,25. Currently, we are conducting a

study on the clinical impact of SGLT2i on COVID-19 patients; using the results, we

plan to provide partial answers to important clinical questions as soon as possible.

Since ACE2 is also a known as a physiologic regulator of human coronavirus

infection, the possibility that RAS blockade may negatively affect the susceptibility

and severity of COVID-19 infection has been hypothesized 26,27. However, it is known

that RAS blockade has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pleiotropic effects, and

research results on preventing pulmonary complication in vulnerable patients have

been reported28,29. A systemic review states that there is currently no clear evidence

as to whether angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor

blocker needs to be started or stopped for viral infections, including COVID-1915.

In our study, RAS blockade tended to decrease the aOR for severe/lethal cases;

however, this decrease was statistically insignificant. This implies that RAS-blockade

users are also more likely to exhibit comorbidities than non-users, and hence, it is

possible that this is a vulnerable clinical condition that requires more medication. It is

also possible that the number of subjects studied was not sufficient to confirm

statistical significance. This may have been because the effects on the long-term

clinical course and prognosis were not considered; owing to the limitation of our

study design, only the short-term clinical outcomes of the subjects were analyzed.

The synergistic effect of the combination of DPP-4i and RAS blockade could not be

explained for the same reason.

This study has other limitations. Firstly, since this study was based on claim data, it

was difficult to obtain detailed clinical information about the patients. In particular, it

was difficult to evaluate the patient's demographic characteristics, laboratory tests,

images,

demonstrated that DPP-4i users exhibited better clinical outcomes; however, these

results did not imply a clear causal relationship. Thirdly, it was difficult to predict the

long-term clinical course and prognosis of the patients because our analysis was

for

short-term

clinical

outcomes.

Fourthly,

this

study

may

be

difficult

to

generalize with respect to other countries as it was conducted in Korea, where the

proportion of severely ill patients and fatalities related to COVID-19 is lower than that

in other countries. Lastly, further research is needed because a clear mechanism for

explaining

the

facts

obtained

in

this

study

has

not

been

established.

These

limitations necessitate careful interpretation and generalization of the results.

However, this study was based on a large dataset representative of the entire

population of Korea, and such large-scale studies are rare. Moreover, with regard to

situations where effective prevention or treatment of COVID-19 infection has not

been established, our research results contain meaningful data on drugs that are

commercially available and applicable to many people. In particular, using Korea's

national medical insurance claim data for the past 5 years, it was possible to

consider the impact of comorbidities and various medications in the analysis.

Currently, efforts are being made in Korea to increase the size and quality of the

COVID-19 database used in research for public interest. In the future, detailed

will

enable

a

understanding of the disease, and it is expected that a more effective methodology

for prevention and treatment will be established soon.

In conclusion, this population-based study suggests that DPP-4i is significantly

associated with a better clinical outcome of COVID-19 infection. However, the effect

of RAS blockade is not significant.
