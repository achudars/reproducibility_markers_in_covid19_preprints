Abstract and Findings
Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28,
2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). For the first period the cumulative number of
cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward
deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed
by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the
original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we
subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model
predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic
growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we
estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions
in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of
maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases
increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in
contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible
other secondary sources of infection.
Introduction
Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus (designated 2019-nCoV) originated in Wuhan, China
raised serious public health concerns and many human tragedies. To manage the epidemics
resulting from virus spreading across China and other countries forecasting the occurrence of
future cases is extremely important. Such forecasting is very complicated and uncertain since
many factors are poorly understood or estimated with a large possible error. Two major factors
include spatial movement of virus carriers (i.e., infected individuals) and the basic reproduction
number R0 (average number of new infections originated from an infected individual).
As a result of great public attention to the virus spreading several approaches were recently
reported attempting to model the epidemics and infection dynamics (Chen et al., 2020; Hui et al.,
2020; Imai, Cori, et al., 2020; Imai, Dorigatti, Cori, Donnelly, et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Linton

et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Shen, Peng, Xiao, & Zhang, 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020;
Zhang & Wang, 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020a). These models are certainly useful to understand the
implications of various quarantine procedures, public health actions, and possible virus
modifications. However, the reported models are, by its nature, very complicated with numerous
assumptions and requiring many parameters values of which are not known with good accuracy.
As a result, some predictions (Nishiura et al., 2020) were more educated guesses although
eventually they were confirmed qualitatively.
In this work, we present the results of fitting a very simple (perhaps even simplistic) model to the
available data and a forecast of new infections.
Logistic Model and its Application
The logistic model has been used in population dynamics and specifically in epidemics for a long
time (Bailey, 1950; Bangert, Molyneux, Lindsay, Fitzpatrick, & Engels, 2017; Cockburn, 1960;
Jowett, Browning, & Haning, 1974; Koopman, 2004; Mansfield & Hensley, 1960; Waggoner &
Aylor, 2000). Mathematically, the model describes dynamic evolution of a population P (in our
case the number of infected individuals) being controlled by the growth rate r and population
capacity K due to limiting resources. In continuous time t the change of P is
𝑃

𝑑𝑃/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑟 𝑃 (1 − 𝐾)

(1)

Initially, the growth of P is close to exponential since the term (1 − 𝑃⁄𝐾 ) is almost one. When P
becomes larger (commensurate with K) the growth rate slows down with
𝑃

𝑟𝑒 = 𝑟 (1 − 𝐾)
becoming an effective instantaneous growth rate.

(2)

In discrete time, more appropriate to daily reported infection cases, the logistic model becomes
𝑃(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑅0∗ 𝑃(𝑡) [1 −

𝑃(𝑡)
𝐾

]

(3)

where P(t) and P(t+1) are populations on consecutive days, R0* is the growth rate (basic
reproduction number in epidemiology) at the beginning of the logistic growth, and K is the
limiting population. When plotted as a function of time t, both Eqs. (1) and (3) result in a
classic sigmoidal curve with
𝑅𝑒 = 𝑅0∗ [1 −

𝑃(𝑡)
𝐾

]

(4)

being the effective reproduction rate at time t.
The logistic model may be adequate for the analysis of mainland China since the country can be
treated as a unit where a vast majority of cases occurred without any significant “import“ or
“export” of cases.

Data Analysis
We analyzed infection cases in mainland China as reported by the National Health Commission
of the People’s Republic of China (www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/xxgzbd/gzbd_index.shtml). As of the
time of writing the number of cases is shown in Table 1. The data are also plotted in Figure 1.
The first column in Table 1 represents days from the beginning of the outbreak. There is a
considerable controversy as to the exact date of the outbreak with most reports pointing to midDecember (Li et al., 2020; Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020) while one analysis suggest
multiple sources of original infection (Nishiura et al., 2020). Initially, the outbreak was not
recognized and number of confirmed cases is not fully known (P. Wu et al., 2020). Initially,
(Figure 1), the number of cases increased exponentially. This feature was also clearly recognized
in a previous report (Zhao et al., 2020b).

However, starting from January 28 (day 42) there was a marked deviation from the exponential
curve, in line with logistic growth. This decline of the growth rate is clearly demonstrated by a
steady decline of the effective reproduction number Re (fourth column in Table 1) calculated
simply as a ratio of cases on consecutive days
𝑅𝑒 (𝑡) = [

𝑃(𝑡+1)
𝑃(𝑡)

] = 𝑅0∗ (1 −

) = 𝑅0∗ − [ 𝐾0 ] 𝑃(𝑡)

Eq. (5) also shows a linearization of the discrete logistic model (Eq. (3)) that was used to
estimate the Re(t=30) = R0* and capacity K. An example of such linearization for Period 1 is
shown in Figure 2 with the initial 16 points (blue points and line in Figure 2). The same figure
also shows linearization using for Period 2 (orange points and line in Figure 2 ). For all periods
the effective reproduction numbers decrease in time.

following Eq. (5) for Periods 1 and 2
In contrast, a simple linearization of Re in time (Figure 3) back-estimated the original basic
reproduction number R0 at about 2.4 to 2.5, agreeing well with other values recently reported
(Imai, Dorigatti, Cori, Riley, & Ferguson, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Majumder & Mandl, 2020;
Zhang & Wang, 2020a, 2020b; Zhao et al., 2020a). The discrepancy between these two estimates
can be attributed a potential loss of virulence of the virus but most likely due to extreme
measures to contain virus spread in China.

This linearization provides yet another method for the use of the logistic model. We use linear
regression as shown in Figure 3 to calculate the effective reproduction numbers for a series of
days Re*(t) with the * superscript denoting that the values are calculated from the regression.
Using Eqs. (3) and (4) the predicted values of P(t) can be calculated regressively as
𝑃(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑅𝑒∗ (𝑡) 𝑃(𝑡)

Forecast and Discussion
Based on the linearization of Eq. (5), we obtained the parameters of the logistic model for three
periods as shown in Table 2. The resulting prediction of future infection cases are shown in

The model predicted further increases of the infected cases but slower than the initial exponential
growth. As expected, new data resulted in further model refinement primarily in the values of K
and the resulting maximum cases.
Following a parallel approach and using Eq. (6) we obtained yet another set of predictions shown
in together with those from Figure 4. This approach results in a dramatically higher predictions

Despite differences among different estimate, the critical feature of the model predictions is the
stabilization of the total number of cases in the next several days (by mid-February) and not a
dramatic exponential growth. This prediction is made purely based on the described analysis and
may or may not happen in the future. One significant factor that could invalidate the predictions
is a possibility of secondary or parallel outbreaks perhaps with different etiology as previously
suggested for the original Wuhan outbreak (P. Wu et al., 2020)
