Abstract
Background: With the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
infected patients within and beyond the epidemic area, Wuhan, China, showed different
epidemiological and clinical characteristics. There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection
with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan.
Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute
respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in
Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence
was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in
collected acute phase serum.
Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao.
The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38)
years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan
(55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies
against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan
had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P<0.0001). The most common
respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A
(60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%)
and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with
community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only
20.90%.
Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of
seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the
patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19
patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens.
We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals
to prevent misdetection of the virus.

Introduction
At the beginning of December 2019, a cluster of “pneumonia of unknown aetiology”
emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease has soon developed into an outbreak
posing a pandemic threat. Since no causative pathogen was identified at the onset of the
disease, it was once called “Wuhan pneumonia” by the health officials and the public. On
December 31, 2019, a total of 27 cases were reported; meanwhile, a rapid response team led
by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) was formed to
conduct detailed epidemiologic and aetiologic investigations in Wuhan.1-3 After ruling out
common respiratory pathogens such as influenza, avian influenza, respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV), adenovirus (ADV), respiratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), etc., a novel
coronavirus was confirmed as the aetiological agent on January 7, 2020 and related disease
was termed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organisation
(WHO).4 Subsequent full-length genome sequencing analysis indicated that the newly
discovered virus, now known as severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
belongs to a distinct beta-coronavirus genus of probable bat origin.5,6 Thus far, the epidemic
has swept through the nation. At the time of writing, the number of confirmed COVID-19
cases in China has increased to 79,968, causing 2,873 deaths.7 The fast-growing outbreak has
affected over fifty countries and regions beyond China, constituting a public health
emergency of international concern.8
Strikingly, we found a large proportion of coinfection with other seasonal respiratory
pathogens in COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals in Qingdao, Shandong Province,
northeast China, which differed from those of the primary infected patients from the epidemic
centre, Wuhan, central China.3,9 To determine such between-region difference and to explore
the underlying reasons, we conducted this double-centre study recruiting COVID-19 patients
admitted in Qingdao and Wuhan hospitals. We hope our study will provide new insights into
clinical diagnosis and prophylactic control of COVID-19 and to facilitate an in-depth
understanding of the disease.

Methods
Study areas
We chose Qingdao and Wuhan as the study centres to investigate the difference in
coinfection with common respiratory pathogens among COVID-19 patients. Figure 1
showed the geographical location of two cities. As depicted, Qingdao is situated about 850

kilometres northeast of Wuhan.
Participants
We recruited patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who admitted to the 3
designated hospitals in Qingdao (Qingdao Women and Children’s Hospital, Affiliated
Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, and Qingdao Chest Hospital) and Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Laboratory testing was
done for all patients for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. The
epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, and laboratory findings were extracted
from electronic medical records. Radiographic evidence included chest X-ray or computed
tomography (CT). Laboratory assessments consisted of blood routine, blood biochemistry,
liver function and C-reactive protein measurements. All patients had positive results of
nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract specimens. The diagnosis of COVID-19
was made according to WHO interim guidance and the severity of disease was mild to
moderate.4 Seven cases in Qingdao were not included in demographic and clinical analysis
due to lack of related information. To test the reliability of pathogen detection method, we
randomly selected 16 healthy blood donors and 14 asymptomatic individuals who came to the
hospitals in Qingdao for health counselling as the group for quality control (healthy control
group). In addition, 67 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who admitted to
the local hospitals in Qingdao at the same time were enrolled as a comparable group to
COVID-19 patient group (CAP control group). Diagnosis of CAP was based on the latest
clinical guideline.10
This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of each participating hospital
(QFFLL-KY-2020-11) and written informed consent was obtained from involved patients
prior to enrolment.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples
Laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 was done in biosafety level 3 (P3) laboratory at
individual hospital within 2 hours after sample collection; samples collected in Qingdao were
also double-tested by Municipal Centre of Disease Control and Prevention of Qingdao.
Throat swabs were obtained from all patients upon admission using standardised techniques
in negative-pressure isolation rooms. After collection, throat swab was kept in 1.5 mL virus
preservation solution for subsequent extraction of total RNA using a magnetic bead-based kit
(HEALTH BioMed Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was detected by
real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both the
commercial kits used in Qingdao (DAAN Gene Co., Ltd of Sun Yat-sen University, China)

Drug Administration (CFDA). For samples tested in Qingdao, the PCR assay simultaneously
amplified two target genes of SARS-CoV-2 included open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and
nucleocapsid protein (N) and the sequences were as follows: forward primer 5 ′

Amplification was performed under the following conditions: incubation at 50 °C for 15 min
and 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 sec, and
extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 °C for 15 sec (7500 Real-Time PCR
Systems, Applied BiosystemsTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A cycle threshold (Ct) value no
more than 40 with evident amplification curve was considered as a positive test, and a Ct
value over 40 was defined as a negative result. Procedures of viral detection done in Wuhan
was described elsewhere.11
Detection of serum IgM antibody against respiratory pathogens
Laboratories in Qingdao and Wuhan adopted a similar protocol for detection of IgMspecific antibodies against respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Indirect
immunofluorescence (IIFA) was performed to detect serum IgM antibody by using a
commercially available kit (samples collected from Qingdao patients: EUROIMMUN
Medizinische Labor diagnostika AG, CN; samples collected from Wuhan patients: Vircell,
S.L., Santa Fe´, Granada, Spain) according to manufacturer’s instructions.12 IIFA can detect 9
of the common respiratory pathogens including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus
(ADV), influenza virus A (IFV-A), influenza virus B (IFV-B), parainfluenza virus (PIV),
mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), legionella pneumophila (LP)
and Coxiella burnetii (COX) in a single assay. Briefly, diluted serum solution (1:100 for
detection of LP and 1:10 for other pathogens) was incubated on each well of the slide and
stained with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies. The multi-well slide was then processed for
fixing, staining, washing and drying steps, the entire well containing the stained specimen
was examined under an epifluorescence microscope. RT-PCR nucleic acid test was also
performed in respiratory specimens collected from Wuhan patients for detection of other 13

Results
By February 16, 2020, a total of 68 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection was included in the final analysis, among whom 30 were from Qingdao and 38 were
from Wuhan (Table 1). The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 years (IQR:
37-59) and 31 years (IQR: 28-38), respectively. The median duration from symptom onset to
hospitalisation was 2 days (IQR: 0-5) for patients in Qingdao and 4 days (IQR: 2-5) for that
in Wuhan. The majority of patients admitted in Qingdao and Wuhan hospitals were female,
representing a proportion of 60.00% and 55.26%, respectively. The most common symptoms
at onset of COVID-19 were fever (66.67% vs. 57.89%) and cough (50.00% vs. 68.42%) in
both Qingdao and Wuhan patients. Over one third of the Qingdao patients had underlying
diseases (36.67%), a proportion much higher than that of Wuhan patients (2.63%). In
comparison with Wuhan patients, Qingdao patients were older, had a higher respiratory rate
(20 breaths/min [IQR: 19-21] vs. 19 breaths/min [IQR: 18-20]) and increased diastolic blood
pressure (77 mmHg [IQR: 70-84] vs. 72 mmHg [IQR: 70-77]; all P values less than 0.05). On
admission, white blood cell and platelet counts of Qingdao patients were higher than those of
Wuhan patients (median white blood cell count: 5.11×109/L [IQR: 4.15-6.10] vs. 4.17×109/L
[IQR: 3.50-5.60], P=0.0401; median platelet count: 237 × 109/L [IQR: 169-265] vs. 166 ×
109/L [IQR: 148-207], P=0.0043). The median total bilirubin level was 12.50 mol/L (IQR:
μ

10.50-15.50) in Qingdao patients, which was significantly higher than that in Wuhan patients
(7.14 mol/L [IQR: 5.70-9.70], P=0.0016).
μ

All patients had respiratory specimens tested for specific IgM antibodies against IFV-A,
IFV-B, RSV, ADV, PIV, MP, LP, CP and COX. Among the 30 patients admitted in Qingdao,
24 patients had IgM antibodies detected against at least one of the above-mentioned
pathogens, and the overall positive rate was 80.00% (Table 3); whereas only one (2.63%) of
the patients in Wuhan had positive results for respiratory pathogens. The most common
respiratory viruses detected were IFV-A (60.00%) and IFV-B (53.33%), followed by MP
(23.33%) and LP (20.00%).
Ages of healthy control group ranged from 20 to 55 years, with a median age of 40 years

(IQR: 33-50), and 14 (46.67%) were men. Only 4 people (13.33%) of this group had specificIgM antibody detected in their serum, suggesting asymptomatic infection with single virus
(IFV-B). The total infection rate in healthy control was significantly lower than that in
COVID-19 patients (P<0.0001, Table 4), and none of the individual in control group showed
evidence of combined infection with two or more pathogens.
Figure 2 showed the rate of coinfection with other respiratory pathogens detected in
Qingdao COVID-19 patients as compared with CAP controls. The overall positive rate for
coinfection in CAP group was 20.90%, significantly lower than the figure in COVID-19
patients (80.00%, P=0.0055). Except for SARS-CoV-2, 7 (23.33%) COVID-19 patients had
mixed infections of IFV-A and IFV-B, 6 (20.00%) patients of this group had 3 respiratory
pathogens (IFV-A, IFV-B and MP/LP) detected, and 13.33% of them had combined infection
of IFV-A only. Whereas the pattern for coinfection in CAP group was quite different: patients
were more often coinfected with IFV-B and MP (8.96%), followed by a combination of IFVA and MP (4.48%), and MP and RSV (2.99%). Thus, it can be seen that COVID-19 patients
had distinct aetiological features of coinfection from CAP patients.
The climatic characteristics of Qingdao and Wuhan from December to January of following
year were shown in Table 5, where differences could be observed between the two cities.
Although the climate in Qingdao is drier and colder than Wuhan, major respiratory pathogens
circulate in the two cities were quite similar.

Discussion
This is an extended descriptive study on COVID-19 patients between Wuhan and Qingdao,
represented as within and beyond the epidemic centre, respectively. Since the early onset of
COVID-19 till the specific definition of novel coronavirus (previously known as 2019-nCoV)
releasing on January 7, 2020,4 the term “illness/pneumonia of unknown aetiology” was
repeatedly quoted by the health officials and the public during this one-month period. One of
the possible explanations for such failure to clearly define the disease is that no causative
pathogen could be found at the early stage. We speculated that if any common respiratory
pathogen, such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, ADV, MP and CP, or the
previous emerging novel coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was isolated
from body fluids and secretions of the infected patients, related treatment and management
could have been implemented in the first place. As such, it was very unlikely that
“pneumonia of unknown causes” would still be emphasized, although this might cause delay
in the discovery of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we assumed that the possibility of coinfection in

COVID-19 patients was very rare. Our assumption was led support by two recent studies
conducted in Wuhan showing that there was no coinfection of respiratory pathogens in
COVID-19 cases.3,9
According to our data, the majority of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao were not from the
endemic area; they were infected indirectly without a history of traveling to Wuhan. Despite
the high coinfection rate in Qingdao patients who had more complicated clinical conditions
(who were elder with more underlying diseases), there are no signs of worsening of these
patients’ clinical manifestations or disease prognosis as compared with Wuhan patients.
Whether immune regulation associated with earlier infection with common respiratory
pathogens confers an element of protection against the pathological damage caused by
subsequent infection of SARS-CoV-2 remains unanswered. A study conducted in Zhejiang
Province, China revealed that COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan had relatively mild
symptoms as compared with those initially reported in Wuhan.13 Like patients in Qingdao,
these Zhejiang patients had no direct contact with the original site of outbreak (Wuhan
Huanan Seafood Market). Evidence is scarce at the present stage to explain whether it is due
to the weakening of SARS-CoV-2 virulence during virus transmission. Previous studies on
SARS have shown that the disease was more infectious at an earlier stage when compared to
the later stage.14 The global mortality rate of MERS was about 40% and declined sharply to
less than 20% during second generation transmission.15 Currently, our first priority is to slow
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Some of the patients are still under hospitalised treatment or in
quarantine, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to illustrate the underlying mechanisms in
the future.
Here we also compared the geographical and climatic characteristics of Qingdao and
Wuhan. Wuhan is located in the centre of southern China and has a subtropical climate;16,17
while Qingdao is situated in the coastal area of northern China in the temperate zone, which
has a relatively lower humidity than Wuhan.18 Despite the difference in natural characteristics
between the two cities, common respiratory pathogens circulate in Wuhan and Qingdao
(including IFV-A, IFV-B, RSV, and ADV) have shown to be generally similar during the
peak season of respiratory diseases in wintertime (from January to February).19-22 The
incidence of coinfection in COVID-19 patients in Wuhan was rather low. Whereas in places
with relatively low temperature like northern Qingdao, it is more common to find combined
SARS-CoV-2 infection with other seasonal respiratory pathogens. It is not yet known
whether this phenomenon also exists in other regions, leaving a gap for future studies. There
are limited data to address whether coinfection with other respiratory pathogens would affect

the pathogenesis and outcome of severe acute respiratory illnesses like SARS and MERS.23-27
Fortunately, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all of our patients before other respiratory
pathogens being detected. Otherwise these COVID-19 patients would have been treated in a
way as infected with other respiratory pathogens, which might result in devastating
consequences. Our findings provide some important implications for the prevention and
management of COVID. First of all, it is very effective and efficient for the China CDC and
local governments to launch series of aggressive measures to screen, quarantine, diagnose,
treat and monitor suspected patients and their close contacts in response to the widespread
transmission of the virus. Moreover, we must remain vigilant when dealing with COVID-19
cases in other locations outside of Wuhan. Even common respiratory pathogens are detected
by diagnostic testing, we still need to rule out the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
light of the emergence of coinfected COVID-19 cases, there might be a long-term
coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 with humans, just as other seasonal respiratory pathogens. Last
but not least, we highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to the diagnostic testing assay as
soon as possible, in a manner as how we routinely screen influenza and parainfluenza viruses,
RSV, ADV, MP and CP, etc. Our hospitals adopted the above-mentioned screening and
surveillance protocol right after the recognition of first coinfected COVID-19 case. Further
detailed investigations should aim to ascertain the exact reasons underlying the high
coinfection rate outside of Wuhan.
It is notable that there are several limitations of this study. Two critically ill patients and
one patient who died in the end were excluded due to lack of aetiological data other than
SARS-CoV-2. As of February 16, 2020, there were 60 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection in Qingdao, however, we only analysed 30 non-severe cases whose complete
aetiological and clinical information was available. The age of patients in Qingdao ranged
from 1.5 years to 80 years; whereas patients in Wuhan were all adults as they were medical
professional infected through work. Such age difference between the two groups might bring
in bias to this study. We performed nucleic acid testing for the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2
infection, while coinfection with other pathogens was detected by serological testing of
antibodies. In spite of superior accuracy, PCR-based molecular testing using throat swabs
requires more complicated techniques of laboratory personnel with prolonged reporting time,
which may not be suitable for emerging cases of SARS-CoV-2.28,29 Thus, we applied rapid
testing of aetiological agents by IIF in collected acute phase serum to guide clinical decision
making. Since both the hospitals in Qingdao and Wuhan adopted the same protocol for the
diagnosis of coinfection, we believe this will not affect the determination of final outcomes.

To test the reliability of serum specific IgM detection, we recruited a control group of normal
people without clinical symptoms. The low infection rate in our control population suggested
that our method was reliable in early and rapid diagnosis of respiratory infections. However,
we were unable to exclude the possibility that coinfection with other respiratory pathogens
may make the patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specific-IgM antibody
could be detected in serum from one week of illness onwards and the amount progressively
increased and peaked at about two weeks after infection.30 Positive results for serum IgM
antibody detection only indicate infection with specific pathogens during the past one to two
months but cannot specify the time sequence of coinfection with various pathogens.
Till now, the epidemic is still expanding with the number of infected patients escalating
rapidly, and the situation in countries and regions beyond China presents a more dismal
picture. Recently, WHO upgraded the risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 to very high; as of
March 1, 2020, a total of 7,169 cases in 58 countries, and 104 deaths have been reported
outside China.8 Hence, we call for a timely action to carry out real-time research on the
epidemic dynamic of SARS-CoV-2.
