Abstract
Globally, the heterogenous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case fatality rate (CFR) could be

influenced by various epidemiological parameters. Identifying these could help formulate effective

public health strategies. Incidence and mortality of COVID-19 for each of the 220 countries as on July

30, 2020 were evaluated against key epidemiological variables, namely - BCG vaccination (ongoing

vs.

discontinued/never

undertaken),

%population

aged

≥65

years,

incidences

of

ischemic

heart

disease (IHD), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), cancer, malaria, and diabetes; human development

index (HDI) and population density. These were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN,

World Bank and published reports. The COVID-19 CFRs ranged between 0.0% and 28.3% (mean ± SD:

3.05% ± 3.48). The influence of the individual epidemiological parameters on CFR were evaluated

through the event rate estimations. A significantly lower event rate was observed in countries with

ongoing BCG vaccination program (ER: with vs without ongoing BCG vaccination: 0.020 vs 0.034,

p<0.001). The type of BCG strains used also influenced the ER; this being 0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for

Introduction
As the global community eagerly waits for a successful vaccine against severe acute respiratory

sickness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease

2019 (COVID-19), the morbidity and mortality continues to rise unabated. While some countries

have seen off the passing of the first wave of COVID-19, others continue to face the onslaught with a

rising trend. Further, the danger of a second wave still looms large over the regions that have

contained the first wave of COVID-19 with varying degrees of morbidity and mortality.

A glance at the world-wide pattern of case fatality of COVID-19 reveals a gross heterogeneity

in its distribution. This could be attributed to a complex interaction of host factors that could include

the virulence of the

strains of SARS-CoV-2, appropriate enforcement of containment measures,

screening and contact tracing, population density, availability of adequate medical care, inherent

susceptibility of the population, associated comorbid conditions, socioeconomic status and others

[1-9]. Presently, although there are some indications of the individual factors to impact the COVID-

19 mortality, a comprehensive evaluation of the relevant epidemiological variables towards the

heterogenous

case

is

needed

to

identify

parameter/s

that

might

help

to

alleviate

the

mortality and consider active interventions in high-risk population.

Thus,

a

has

been

carried

out

by

rates

to

evaluate the influence of key epidemiological factors on the case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19. As

the policy of subjecting the inhabitants of a country to routine BCG vaccination is the variable in the

220 countries evaluated, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the likely impact of BCG vaccination

on the heterogenous COVID-19 CFR. Thus the effect of BCG vaccination and the strains used have

been studied to specifically estimate its impact on each of the high-risk populations as evident from

this study. This might assist the national health agencies to formulate country specific public health

guidelines to mitigate the COVID-19 case fatality, especially

in high-risk inhabitants.

Methods
Databases used

The estimates of total cases, total deaths, cases/million and deaths/million due to COVID-19 were

extracted

for

each

country

and

their

dependent

territories

as

listed

in

the

WHO

[10]

and

Worldometer [11] websites as on July 7, 2020 (Fig.1). COVID-19 CFR for each country was computed

using the total cases and deaths listed as (total deaths/total cases) x 100.

The epidemiological parameters were retrieved from the public domains of WHO, UN, World

Bank, BCG World Atlas and published reports for each listed countries (Fig.1). These included - %BCG

vaccination (2018) [12, 13], %population aged ≥65 years (2018) [14], incidences of ischemic heart

disease (IHD) (2015) [15], hypertensive heart disease (HHD) (2015) [15], cancer (2020) [16], malaria

(2018) [17] and diabetes [18]; human development index (HDI) (2019) [19] and population density

(2018) [20]. In all cases, the latest values listed in the above public domains were considered.

Based on the national BCG immunization program, the countries were grouped as, either (a)

It was also evident that BCG strains used for their immunization program varied in these

countries. Broadly these countries are classified as using early (BCG Russia, Brazil, Japan, Sweden,

Birkhaug) or late BCG strains (BCG Prague, China, Glaxo, Denmark, Tice, Frappier, Connaught, Phipps,

Pasteur) [21, 22]. Some countries had also used mixed BCG strains. The details of the type of BCG

BCG World Atlas [13] and also the published reports [21, 22] and classified as early, late and mixed

BCG strains.

Grouping based on case fatality rates

Based on their COVID-19 CFR, the 220 countries were divided into low, moderate and high risk

groups. The cutoff values were determined as (a) low risk group with CFR

these on the CFR for each of the 3 groups were evaluated.

Statistical considerations: COVID-19 event rate and case fatality rate analysis

COVID-19 events rates for each of the 220 countries were computed as events/nonevents. For each

country, the events indicate the number of deaths, while nonevents were the difference between

the

number

of

confirmed

cases

and

resulting

deaths.

Results
COVID-19: Case fatality rate

Of the 220 countries and their dependent territories, 209 were represented in both the WHO and

Worldometer websites while seven additional countries were extracted from the WHO [10] and four

from Worldometer [11] public domains (Fig.1). As of July 30, 2020, a total of 17.3 million cases of

COVID-19 have been reported from 220 countries worldwide (S1 Table). The total cases reported

from these countries have ranged from 3 to 4.58 million (mean ± SD: 78716.5 ± 377563). A total of

0.67 million deaths have been ascribed to COVID-19 and this varied between 0 to 0.15 million in

these 220 countries. Consequently the COVID-19 CFR ranged from 0% to 28.3% (median: 2.1%)

(Fig.2a). The gross heterogeneity in the cases/million, deaths/million and COVID-19 CFR are evident

from Table 1.

Epidemiological parameters

BCG immunization program for all inhabitants is currently underway in 144 of the 220 countries with

%coverage ranging between 37% and 99% (91.3% ± 10.5, median: 95%) (Table 1, Fig. 2b). In 75

countries, either the BCG is advocated in selective high-risk subjects (n=5) or has been suspended

(n=21). In the remaining 49 countries, either it was never used or details on the coverage was not

available from both WHO and BCG Atlas sites [12, 13]. All these 75 countries were thus categorized

Groups based on case-fatality rates

Based on the percentiles of COVID-19 CFR as defined above, 75, 67 and 78 countries were classified

into low, moderate and high-risk. Each of the epidemiological variables were estimated for these

groups and compared. The variables found to be significant in terms of the COVID-19 CFR were %

(p=0.016) and cancer (p<0.001) (Table 2, Figs. 2b-e). The incidence of HHD, diabetes, malaria, HDI

per the COVID-19 CFR.

Epidemiological parameters vs COVID-19 event rate and case fatality rate

Countries in which the BCG immunization program is ongoing has a significantly lesser event rate

variables, these were divided into two

groups based on

covariates found to be significantly influencing the COVID-19 event rate were – %population aged

Impact of BCG on the higher risk subgroups of significant epidemiological parameters

BCG vaccination was found to significantly reduce the COVID-19 event rate for each of the high-risk

subgroups of key epidemiological covariates. Thus event rates for BCG vaccination (not ongoing vs.

ongoing) for each of the high risk subgroups were - %population of 65+ years >7.1% (0.036 vs 0.023,

p=0.008), IHD >1171/10

(0.035 vs 0.022, p=0.004), HDI >0.737 (0.037 vs 0.020, p=0.001), and cancer

incidence >15726 (0.043 vs 0.022, p<0.001) (Fig.4).

Impact of type of BCG strains on COVID-19 case fatality rate

Of the 144 countries with ongoing BCG vaccination program, the type of strains used was available in

127. Of these, 35 countries advocated early BCG strains while in 27, late BCG strains was used for

immunization. Mixed strains was adopted in 65 countries. The COVID-19 event rates computed were

0.018, 0.031 and 0.019 for early, late and mixed strains respectively (p=0.008) (Fig. 5).

Discussion
The ferocity of development of COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented thrust to accept

the challenge and explore various options to help lessen its global impact on health, economy and

society. While the search continues to find the most optimum therapeutic combination, the quest

for a specific vaccine directed towards SARS-CoV-2 remains the ultimate focus of the current global

research. Concurrently, a number of reports have looked into the various demographical factors that

appear to influence the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 [1-9]. However, even if these could

attribute towards the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19, the ability to effectively modify these

variables through prospective interventions are limited.

One of the variables, %BCG coverage has widely varied across the 220 countries facing the

pandemic [12, 13]. BCG provides heterologous immunoprotection against a wide range of microbes

including respiratory and yellow fever viruses [25-28]. The nonspecific protection offered by BCG

vaccine could be due to similarities between the viral and the BCG antigens, antigen independent

activation of the bystander B- and T-cells or long-term activation and reprogramming of the innate

immune cells [25]. This is proposed as development of “trained immunity”[29]. This immunity is

independent of T- and B-cell memory and provides a nonspecific cross-protection contributed by the

innate immune cells - macrophages and natural killer cells. An excellent summary of the possible

mechanisms of BCG induced trained and its likely impact on COVID-19 has been recently outlined by

O’Neill and Netea [7].

In view of the gross heterogeneity in the reported COVID-19 case fatality, the present study

had

the

impact

of

various

epidemiological

parameters

and

their

interactions

on

the

outcomes covering a population of over 7.76 billion in 220 countries. Population ≥65 years and

associated comorbidities like IHD and

cancer have shown to negatively influence the outcomes

(Table 2 and Fig.3). The impact of HDI was not evident on the three group classifications based on

COVID-19 CFR (Table 2). However, countries with higher HDI showed a significantly higher event rate

(HDI: ≤0.737 vs >0.737, event rate 0.019 vs. 0.026, p=0.003) (Fig.3). This could be perhaps attributed

to

the

fact

that

in

most

HDI

countries

had

no

ongoing

BCG

immunization

for

its

population

(Spearman correlation: -0.162, p=0.03). Higher prevalence of diabetes, malaria and HHD along with a

higher population density were not significantly associated with higher COVID-19 CFR in their group

classification (Table 2) nor on the event rate (Fig.3).

BCG vaccination has shown to mitigate the influence of BCG on COVID-19 [8, 21, 30, 31].

However, these studies have usually been reported looking at BCG only. Since we expect that other

epidemiological parameters could also have an influence on the COVID-CFR, we examined the most

relevant parameters that could be accessed in the public domains and thereby identify the high-risk

population who could be most vulnerable and need protection. A reduction in the event rate from

0.034 with no active BCG vaccination to 0.020 with ongoing BCG immunization program represents a

41.1% reduction in the event rate (Fig. 3a). Further BCG vaccination appears to significantly reduce

the

population

years

(↓36.1%),

higher

incidences of IHD (↓37.1%), cancer (↓48.8%) and countries with higher HDI (↓45.9%) (Fig. 4).

The impact of immunogenicity induced by BCG could be dependent on the type of strains.

The

strains

are

deficient

in

their

to

methoxymycolic

acid

which

constitute an key group of ligands proficient in inducing trained immunity [21]. Our results lend

support to this hypothesis as the event rate was significantly lower in countries using early strain

BCG (0.18) (Fig.5). The event rate with late BCG strains of 0.031 was nearly the same as those

countries without

BCG vaccination at 0.034 (Figs. 3a and 5). In contrast, those with early and mixed

strains, the event rates were nearly similar at 0.018 and 0.019 respectively.

As on July 30, 2020, of the 10 countries with the worst COVID-19 CFR ranging from 11.1% to

28.3%, seven had no ongoing BCG vaccination program. Of the remaining three countries, two used

late strains of BCG while one had mixed BCG strain. Even though the event rate for mixed BCG strain

vaccination are usually given within 1-year of birth. Netea et al [28, 29] had demonstrated that the

trained immunity status was maintained at least for one year which was the maximum observed

time point in their report. A recent report [21] from 13 European countries who had suspended their

BCG vaccination program more than two decades ago, suggests that the BCG induced heterologous

non-specific protective effect could even last for 20 years or more.

BCG vaccination may not be expected to reduce the number of positive cases, most of

whom could recover through the “trained immunity” imparted by BCG. However as evident from

this analysis and supported by other studies, BCG could reduce the fatal outcomes [8, 21, 30, 31].

One could well argue that the results of this analysis would also depend on the number of tests

performed. However, the testing would certainly influence the cases/million and deaths/million

population estimates. Thus, to minimize the impact of testing, the impact of BCG at the fatality in

those tested positive for COVID-19 was evaluated in this study. Even though a widespread testing

would be desirable, one has to accept that the testing protocols adopted by countries are varied and

depends on their individual policies, availability and logistics of carrying out these tests. These tests

have not been used in most countries as a screening procedure for all subjects. However, tests

would have been conducted in most of the suspected, symptomatic, contacts of positive patients,

high-risk individuals and those subjected to compulsory screening (travelers etc.). Even with all the

inherent limitations as discussed above, the present data

adequate sample of more than 332.84 million test reports obtained globally reported as on July 30,

2020.

Despite these constraints, the evidence of a likely protective effect of BCG vaccination on

COVID-19 is apparent. It would be imperative to examine the effects of BCG vaccinations through

well designed randomized clinical trials. Presently, four phase III randomized clinical trials have been

initiated, one each

in Netherlands (NCT04328441), Australia (NCT04327206), USA (NCT04348370)

and South Africa (NCT04379336) [32]. These are being conducted in healthcare workers randomized

between BCG and placebo

injection of

normal

saline.
