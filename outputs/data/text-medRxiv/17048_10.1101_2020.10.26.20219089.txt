KEYWORDS: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, oral cavity, oropharynx, saliva, antibodies, scRNAseq, atlas

ABSTRACT
Despite signs of infection, the involvement of the oral cavity in COVID-19
is poorly understood. To address this, single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were integrated from human minor salivary glands and gingiva
to identify 11 epithelial, 7 mesenchymal, and 15 immune cell clusters.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry factor expression showed enrichment
in epithelia including the ducts and acini of the salivary glands and the
suprabasal cells of the mucosae. COVID-19 autopsy tissues confirmed in
vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection in the salivary glands and mucosa. Saliva from
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals harbored epithelial cells exhibiting ACE2
expression and SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Matched nasopharyngeal and saliva
samples found distinct viral shedding dynamics and viral burden in saliva
correlated with COVID-19 symptoms including taste loss. Upon recovery,
this cohort exhibited salivary antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Collectively, the oral cavity represents a robust site for COVID-19 infection
and implicates saliva in viral transmission.
INTRODUCTION
The world remains in the midst of the most serious human pandemic in a
century. As of October 15, 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has claimed more than one million lives worldwide and
critically strained health care infrastructures and the global economy (1, 2).
The World Health Organization classifies SARS-CoV-2 as a likely airborne
pathogen transmitted by asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals through close contact via exposure to infected droplets
and aerosols (3). While COVID-19 transmission can occur by activities
involving the oral cavity, e.g. speaking, breathing, coughing, sneezing, and
even singing, most attention has focused on the nasal-lung axis of path of
infection (4-9). A recent systematic review of 40 studies including 10,228
COVID-19-infected subjects found oral manifestations in 45% of all cases
(14). While oral symptoms such as such taste loss, dry mouth, and mucosal blistering occur in the majority of COVID-19 patients (10-13), little is
known about the involvement of the oral cavity SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis
and transmission.
Currently, it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect and
replicate widely in tissues of the oral cavity such as the oral mucosae
or salivary glands (SG). This information is critical because if these are
sites of early infection (15), they could play an important and underappreciated role in transmitting the virus intermucosally to the lungs and/or the
gastrointestinal tract via saliva (Figure 1a; 16-18). Saliva may also play a
central role in transmitting the virus extraorally via discharged, infectious

droplets (19). Saliva is known to harbor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and is now
widely employed in diagnostic testing due to its ease of collection (20-22).
Nevertheless, little is known about the source(s) of virus in saliva nor the
role of oral virus in oral symptoms or transmission.
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes host entry factors such as ACE2 (23) and TMPRSS
family members (TMPRSS2, -4) and understanding the cell types that
harbor these receptors is important for determining infection susceptibilities throughout the body (24, 25). The oral cavity and oropharynx are
lined by specialized stratified squamous mucosae divided into keratinized
(attached gingiva and hard palate) and the non-keratinized (buccal, labial, ventral tongue, oropharyngeal, and unattached gingiva) mucosae.
The specialized mucosae of the dorsal and lateral tongue are adapted
for taste and contain projections called papillae. Moreover, the entirety
of the oral cavity is bathed and protected by saliva. Thus, one of the
challenges to understanding the role of the oral cavity in COVID-19 is its
heterogeneous niches adapted for feeding, speech, and early digestion
(Figure 1b; 26-28). This heterogeneity exists at the regional level and also
in the rich cellular diversity in each oral niche (29, 30). While ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 expression are selectively reported in oral tissues (32-36),
there are no comprehensive descriptions of viral entry factor expression
to pre-dict vulnerabilities across the oral cavity.
We hypothesize that the diverse epithelia of the oral cavity, from mucosa
to SGs, can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and play a role in both symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission in COVID-19. To test this hypothesis,
we generated the first integrated human oral single cell RNA sequencing
atlases to predict cellular sources of susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In situ hybridization (ISH) was used to confirm ACE2 and TMPRSS
expression to epithelia of the SGs and the oral and oropharyngeal mucosae. SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication was confirmed using, autopsy
and outpatient samples using ISH and confirmed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). Nasopharyngeal and saliva samples were studied in a
prospective outpatient cohort examining the relationship between saliva
viral burden, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sloughed epithelial cells, and COVID-19
symptoms. Finally, the associations between salivary antibodies, saliva
viral load, and clinical status were explored. These data provide a useful
approach to predict viral susceptibilities in the oral cavity, demonstrate
SARS-CoV-2 infection of oral and oropharyngeal niches, and illustrate the
potential for both intermucosal and extraoral transmission of COVID-19
through oral secretions. These data further support recommended public
health measures to reduce the risk of transmission of potentially infectious
salivary secretions.

RESULTS
Human oral tissue atlases reveal unprecedented cell heterogeneity.
The SGs and the barrier mucosal epithelia of the oral cavity and oropharynx are likely gateways for viral infection, replication, and transmission.
However, considering the remarkable diversity of these tissues, we
pre-dicted that SARS-CoV-2 tropism would be nonuniform across oral
sites (Figure 1b). To establish the initial database for studying the oral
axes in viral pathogenesis, human oral single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) datasets from the SGs (n=5, labial minor) and oral mucosae
(n=4, gingiva and hard palate mucosae) were aggregated and analyzed
to create a single cell reference atlas of the oral cavity (Figure 2).
Utilizing only the minor SG and gingiva, broad host structural and
immune cell heterogeneity were identified, including 50 cell types (22 in
minor SGs, 28 cell types in mucosa; Supp. Figure 1a) identified. These
glandular and mucosal clusters represented unique sets of markers per
sample with moderate cell type correlations between cell types (Supp.
Figures 1a,b; 2a). Both individual SG and gingival atlases revealed
unique and hereunto unreported cell expression signatures per cluster.
The minor SGs resemble the submucosal glands of the respiratory system
but remain poorly understood in health and disease (37). Minor SGs
num-ber ~1000/person in the human oral cavity and are distributed
throughout the most oral mucosae. They secrete a mucous and proteinrich fluid that both lubricates and protect the overlying mucosa. The
salivary epithelial compartment of the scRNAseq atlas revealed six major

cell types including serous acini (PRR4, ZG16B), mucous acini
(MUC5B, BPIFB2), ducts (S100A2, KRT14), myoepithelia (ACTA2), glial
cells (CHGA), and intrigu-ingly ionocytes (CFTR, FOXI1, V-ATPase)
which were found in higher pro-portion than in the lung (38) and function
to regulate ion composition of the ducts (Supp. Figure 1a). The
connective tissue compartment consisted of fibroblasts (DCN, LUM),
endothelium (arterial (CELP); venules (FOXD3); capillaries (C4), smooth
muscle (DES), and pericytes (PTH1R).
Reflecting the consistent
presence of immune cell, 8 distinct populations of immune cells were
identified and was comprised of a high proportion of IgA+ plasma
cells, B-lymphocytes (MS4A1), T helper (Th) cells (CD154), and two
subsets of CTLs (CD8A), subtype 1 (EOMES, GZMA), and subtype 2
(SPRY, ITGA1). The myeloid-derived compartment included a
subpopula-tion of conventional DC2 (CD1C) and two different types of
macrophages: subtype 1 (CD163) and subtype 2 exhibited an activation
signature (C3, FCGR3A, IFNGR1, CX3CR1).
The gingiva, along with the periodontal apparatus, supports the teeth and
is an indicator of overall dental health status (39), and harbors a diverse
immune cell repertoire in health comprised predominately of neutrophils
and T cells (40). In this study, the mucosal atlas was generated with
mildly inflamed gingival mucosa from healthy individuals and contributed
to the identification of 15 immune cell subpopulations (Figure 2b; 30).
Five populations of dendritic cells were identified including conventional
dendritic cell subtype 1 (XCR1) and subtype 2 (CD300E); activated
dendritic cells (LAMP3), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PACSIN1),

Figure 1 | An infection and transmission axis for SARS-CoV-2 among distinct oral niches. (a) The contribution of the oral cavity to COVID-19 pathogenesis and transmission has been
little explored. It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in the oral mucosa or glands. This is critical because if the glands or mucosa are sites of early infection, they may
play an important and underappreciated role in transmitting virus “intermucosally” to the lungs or gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, saliva may also play a central role in transmitting the
virus extraorally in asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or symptomatic individuals. (b) The human oral cavity is a diverse collection of tissue niches with potentially unique vulnerabilities to viral
infection. These sites include oral mucosae (hard palate, buccal mucosa, dorsal and ventral tongue) as well as the also the terminally differentiated secretory epithelia of the minor saliva
glands (distributed in the buccal and labial mucosa, hard and soft palate, ventral and dorsal tongue) and major saliva glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual). Nearby are diverse
oropharyngeal niches (palatine and lingual tonsils, soft palate). Saliva, a mixture of fluids, electrolytes, proteins, and cells (immune and sloughed mucosal epithelial cells) is made primarily
by the saliva glands and empties into the oral cavity where it mixes with other fluids (crevicular fluid) and cells.

and epithelial resident Langerhans cells (CD207) (41, 42). Among T
cells subtypes, CTLs (CD8A), Th (CD154), regulatory T cells (LAIR2),
γδ T cells (KLRC4), and mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT;
IL23R); a cycling T/NK cell subset (POU2AF1) were cataloged.
Exemplifying the epithelial heterogeneity in the gingiva, 8 distinct
popula-tions were identified without overlap with the 5 SG epithelial
populations (Figure 2; Supp. Figure 1) in the integrated atlas. Five basal
populations (Basal 1-4, and a cycling population), were defined by either
expression of CXCL14, KRT19, SOX6/COL7A1, KRT6A, and CCBN1,
(Supp. Figure 1a). It is known that KRT19 expressing cells defines the
non-keratinized gingiva “pocket” epithelium, whereas KRT6A marks the
basal epithelial population in the keratinized palatal mucosa (43, 44).
Suprabasal cells were sparse in this dataset but defined by the

KRT6B/KRT16 heterodimer pair and IVL (Figure 2; Supp. Figure 1). The
fact that signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include oral
manifestations raised questions regarding the risk of viral infection and
replication in glandular and mucosal epithelial populations, as has been
shown with other viruses (31).
Integrated oral single cell atlases predict SARS-CoV-2
and other viral infections in the oral cavity
To predict viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1,
HCoV-NL63, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43), as well as influenza
and rhinovirus, joint annotation of the SG and gingival scRNAseq atlases
was performed. Thirty-three unique cell types were identified including 11

Figure 2 | Human pan-oral cell atlas reveals unprecedented cell type heterogeneity. (a) To characterize the vulnerabilities of these unique tissues to infection by coronaviruses and
other commonly encountered viruses, we integrated unpublished data from human oral gingiva and palatal mucosa (Byrd, 2020) and minor saliva glands (Warner, 2020). To support these
findings, we also integrated published data sets from mouse (Supp. Figure 3). (b) Overlaid UMAPs delineated by color reveal similar and unique populations based on sample type. (b,
Right) These 50 populations were jointly annotated before integration into 33 cell clusters for the first human pan-oral cell atlas. These results illustrate both shared and unique cell populations are represented in the gingival and saliva gland tissues. In total, 33 unique cell types are identified in oral cavity tissues across epithelial, lamina propria, and immune compartments. (c)
Dot plot expression matrix visualization of the integrated human oral atlas illustrates that cell types are distinguished by unique—and for some oral cell populations—as of yet, undescribed
transcriptional signatures.

Figure 3 | Integrated single-cell atlases uncover broad oral Infection vulnerabilities. (a-c) (a) Vulnerabilities to infection by coronaviruses , influenza, and rhinovirus can be predicted
based on entry factors expression and visualized using expression matrices. Epithelia appear especially at-risk for viral infection. (b) When focused on the 8 epithelial cell populations,
vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 were apparent in both glands and mucosa. These results strongly suggest that the oral cavity may be vulnerable to viral infection, especially for SARSCoV-2. Expression matrices, including low frequency ACE2/TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells in Basal 1, ducts, mucous acini, and myoepithelial clusters, further support broad SARS-CoV-2
vulnerabilities. (c) UMAPS demonstrate distinct cluster vulnerabilities with ACE2 highest in most oral epithelia; however, expression of proteases demonstrated tissue-specific expression
patterns with TMPRSS2 (enriched for SGs) and TMPRSS11D (enriched for mucosal cells). Endosomal proteases, CTSB and CTSL exhibited broad expression across vulnerable cell types.
(d-f) (d) Like the human integrated atlas, by using the cell type expression of known host entry factors mouse atlas support the viral vulnerabilities of the lining mucosa and SGs (14 total
populations including tissue-resident Langerhans cells; LC) as high risk sites for infection by coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs, MERS, HCoVs), influenza, and rhinovirus. (e) These results can be

epithelial, 7 mesenchymal, and 15 immune cell clusters (Figure 2b,c). The
cell-type expression of known viral entry factor genes across cell clusters
and virus types (Figure 3a) demonstrated broad susceptibilities to viral
infection among the epithelial populations (Figure 3b-c). Similar to SARSCoV-1 and HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds to ACE2
and is reported to be activated by tissue-specific proteases (TMPRSS2,
TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D) and endosomal proteases (CTSB, CTSL, BSG,
and possibly, FURIN) to gain entry for viral replication (31).
SARS-CoV-2 viral entry factor expression analyses revealed that no single
oral epithelia subpopulation appeared at singular risk for infection. ACE2
expression was detected in 8 oral epithelial clusters including, Basal 1,
Basal 2, Basal cycling, SG ducts, suprabasal, and SG serous and mu-

cous acini clusters (Figure 3a-c). These findings support multiple oral
epithelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coexpression of the principal entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, used to
predict tissue susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 in specific cell types in the
nasal cavity, lungs, and gut (4, 25, 45), was infrequent among our
epithelial populations likely due to low ACE2 expression. However,
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, co-expression in epithelial cells of the SGs and
mucosa, specifically in the SG ducts and acini, and the Basal 1
population of the gingiva (~0.5% of cells; Figure 3b) was much
higher than all other populations. Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projections (UMAPs) of putative SARS-CoV-2 entry factor expression
revealed expression of ACE2 confined primarily to epithelial clusters of
the SGs (Figure 3c). Proteases were demonstrated to exhibit tissueHuang N, Perez P, Kato T, Mikami Y, et al. | medrXiv | October 29, 2020 | 4

saliva glands and (b) gingiva highlight ACE2 expression in the saliva gland ducts and acini, and that TMPRSS proteases exhibits abundant expression across epithelia. Interestingly,
TMPRSS2 expression is most concentrated in the saliva glands and TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D are higher expressed in gingiva, with 11D displaying a defining difference between these
two oral epithelial niches.(c,d) Using healthy volunteer (c) gland and (d) gingival tissue sections, mRNA expression was confirmed using RNAscope® in situ hybridization (ISH) for ACE2,
TMPRSS2, -4 as well as -11D in gingiva; (see 11D in SG: Supp. Figure 4b). Due to the known shedding/sloughing of suprabasal epithelial cells (d,e; illustrations), we examined both basal
and suprabasal (SB) expression, revealing enrichment of all examined entry factors in suprabasal over basal cells. (e) Using ISH, we map ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (for matched TMPRSS4
and -11D, see Supp. Figure 4) in diverse oral tissues (buccal mucosa, ventral tongue, and the dorsal tongue) as well as examining the oropharynx for the first time (soft palate, tonsils). This
again supported the heterogeneity that can be found in the oral cavity—not only considering basal versus suprabasal enrichment—but also across sites. This mapping also revealed all
sites are vulnerable to infection in suprabasal cells that are sloughed into saliva, a striking finding. Arrowheads in (c-e) indicate high expression (red), Scale bars: (c) 50 μm, (d,e) 25 μm.

specific expression patterns with TMPRSS2 enriched in the SG
epithelia and TMPRSS11D enriched in mucosal cells. Endosomal
proteases, CTSB and CTSL, exhibited broad expression across
potentially susceptible cell types.
The generalizability of the human atlas results was extended by
including additional oral sites not represented in the human oral single
cell atlas by integrating published mouse oral scRNAseq datasets
(Supp. Figure 3). Published mouse oral buccal mucosa (46) and dorsal
tongue (47), and the major SG, submandibular (47) and parotid (48),
datasets were integrated, reannotated, and analyzed for viral entry factor
expression (Supp. Figure 3a). Cell type comparison analysis between
mouse and human annotations revealed moderate correlation

for most clusters (Supp. Figure 2b). Similar to humans, 33 separate,
and 21 integrated, cell populations were identified in the mouse oral
cavity (Supp. Figure 3b,c), Ace2 and Tmprss2/Tmprss4 gene
expression was also enriched in mouse oral epithelial clusters
(Figure 3d-f). Ace2 expression was highest in the SGs and differentiated
epithelia of the tongue, including co-expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2
(Figure 3e,f). Both gland and tongue are sites affected in COVID-19
patients (taste alteration and dry mouth, respectively; 11, 12), and
support the likelihood of an oral infection axis in the pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV-2.

Employing our integrated atlases to understand the involvement of the
oral cavity in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we validated both receptor (ACE2)
and protease (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11D) expression in
the SG and gingival mucosa (Figure 4a,b) using in-situ hybridization (ISH)
and immunofluorescent (IF) imaging (Figure 4c; Supp. Figure 4a,b). As
expected, both the minor and major SG express viral entry receptors in
acini and ducts (parotid gland; Supp. Figure 4c, d). Available bulk RNAseq
of the major and minor SGs was used to compare ACE2 and TMPRSS2
expression between different SG. Minor SGs were found to express higher ACE2 compared to parotid and submandibular SGs assessed which
was confirmed using ISH (Supp. Figure 4c-e). ISH of the gingival basal
and suprabasal tissues showed more expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
family members in the suprabasal cells, compared to basal populations
(Figure 4d).
To comprehensively explore niches without published single cell atlases,
ACE2/TMPRSS expression was mapped across additional anatomic sites
in the oral cavity, including buccal mucosa, ventral and dorsal tongue, and
oropharynx, including soft palate, palatine and lingual tonsillar surface mucosa and crypts (Figure 4e; Supp. Figure 4f). For each entry factor across
the examined oral and oropharyngeal sites, increased suprabasal expression was observed when compared with the basal epithelial compartment
(Figure 4e). Additionally, substantial ACE2 expression was observed in
the in the tonsillar crypt epithelia. It known that the suprabasal cells of oral
mucosa are continuously shed into saliva multiples times per day (49), so
the expression patterning of suprabasal mucosal cells raised the possibility that sloughed cells may be infected and serve as a viral carrier to other
parts of the body or to other humans (see: illustrations in Figure 4e-g).
These results point to multiple sites in the oral cavity for infection and highlight oropharyngeal tissues, specifically the tonsils, as being particularly
important for future study.
Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to assess SARS-CoV-2 transcripts
in a cohort of COVID-19 autopsy tissues from 28 glands and 6 mucosal
sites from 18 patients. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the SG of 57% of
the autopsies (16/28 glands investigated; Figure 5c; Supp. Table 1) with a
trend towards higher viral loads in the minor glands than the paired parotid
glands (n=8 pairs, p=0.0625, Wilcoxon 2-sided signed-rank test; Supp.
Figure 5c) as predicted by bulk RNAseq. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the
submandibular glands was also shown in 2 cases (15). SARS-CoV-2 infection of lining cells of the oral mucosa was verified in two sets of tissues
from autopsy patients (P11, P23) where 5/6 of the available oral cavity
mucosal sites (dorsal tongue, tonsil, uvula) exhibited detectable SARSCoV-2 by ddPCR (Supp. Table 1), although levels of virus varied across
tissue types. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can infect SGs and mucosal sites.
To confirm tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2 in the SG, ACE2 and SARSCoV-2 Spike ISH was completed on tissue sections from parotid (P5,
P7, P19) and minor (P7, P19) SG recovered from COVID-19 autopsies.
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in ACE2-expressing ducts and acini (Figure
5a; Supp. Figure 5a). However, SARS-CoV-2 signals in salivary epithelia
appeared regional, with some acinar units exhibiting more infection than
others. The variable presence of virus in the SG raised questions whether
ducts and/or acini support replication of SARS-CoV-2. Using ISH targeting
the sense strand of SARS-CoV-2, minor and parotid SG (P19, Supp. Table
1) exhibit isolated clusters of acinar and ductal cells exhibiting replication.
Inflammatory responses to the presence of virus in the glands ranged from
mild to severe in SGs (Figure 5b; Supp. Figure 5b).
Microscopic assessment of the COVID-19 autopsy SGs revealed
additional histological findings, including variable chronic sialadenitis
characterized by lymphocytic aggregates or more diffuse inflammation
and architectural distortion. Other samples exhibited atrophy and fibrosis,
mucous inspissation, and ductal dilation. These results confirm that
mucosa are sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish the major
and minor SG as susceptible sites for infection, replication, and
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 via saliva.
Infection of epithelial cells in saliva sets up an oral-systemic axis for
viral diseases.
ISH studies confirmed that the stratified squamous cells of the lining
mucosa of the oral cavity and oropharynx shed into saliva expressed
ACE2 and TMPRSS family members required for SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Figure 5d,e; Supp. Figure 5e,f). This finding raises two critical questions
concerning the role(s) of the oral mucosa in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Firstly, because principal entry factors are expressed in the suprabasal
cells of the oral mucosa that are exposed to the environment, it is possible
that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may be first infected in situ, then shed into
saliva, and contribute to the virus in saliva for transmission. Second, it is
possible that populations of shed infected cells may provide binding sites
for SARS-CoV-2 and/or act as carriers/adjuvants to promote viral stability
and transmissibility.
To explore these possibilities, saliva samples collected from asymptomatic
and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects were analyzed for
SARS-CoV-2 entry factor expression and found to contain both epithelial
(pan-cytokeratin positive; pCK+) and immune (pCK-) populations. ISH
demonstrated heterogeneity, ranging from no to high expression of ACE2
in nucleated squamous keratinocytes (Figure 5f,g). Likewise, TMPRSS2,
-4, and -11D were variably expressed (Figure 5g). Low levels to no ACE2
expression were detected in the immune cells (pCK-; Supp. Fig 6a,b).
Further analysis by ISH on sloughed epithelial cells in COVID-19 saliva
samples demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 Spike expression, often in the ACE2
expressing cells (Figure 5g; Supp. Figure 5g). To quantify this phenomenon, a 10-subject cohort (UNC) showed significantly more SARS-CoV-2
signals in pCK+ cells (34.1% pCK+ vs. 3.5% pCK-; range 5.5-100% and
0.39-13.56%, respectively), supporting the possibility of mucosal infection
in SARS-CoV-2 oral pathogenesis (Figure 5g,h). While reports suggest
about 50% of shed cells in saliva are epithelial (66), these data show
that only ~25% of shed cells in COVID-19 subjects were epithelial
(range 4.0-39%). This reduction likely reflects a shift in the proportions
of cell populations due to immune response or dropout of epithelia due
to programmed cell death denoted by sparse cytokeratin expression
(Figure 5g). Although speculative, this cell type may account for the rare
pCK-, SARS-CoV-2-positive population. This conclusion was supported
by UMAPs of salivary neutrophils, a dominant population of immune
cells found in saliva, which demonstrated virtually no ACE2 or TMPRSS2
expression (Supp. Figure 6a; 50). A rare population of pCK-positive ACE2expressing SARS-CoV-2-positive ciliated cells were found in saliva (Supp.
Figure 5h) indicating that a very small fraction of saliva viral load reflects
contributions from the nasal cavity. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 Spike
independently localized both inside the sloughed squamous epithelial
cells, consistent with infection, but also on the membrane surface (Figure
5i; Supp. Movies 1,2). A universal 16S probe revealed occasional
colocalization of oral bacteria and SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the need to
better understand the shed epithelial cell microbiome (Figure 5i).
In addition to virus dispersion from droplets and aerosols of saliva, these
data emphasize the potential role for shed epithelial cells in saliva to deliver virus to other mucosal sites of the body, such as the gastrointestinal
tract (51, 52) and lungs (53). Using ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA suggestive of viral replication (V-nCoV2019-S sense probe), both minor and
major SG demonstrated clusters cells containing replication (P19, Figure
5d,e). Thus, these results point to two oral innate immune responses to
viral challenge. While broadly susceptible to infection, the mucosa may
successfully shed infected cells and downregulate transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, while less accessible and protected by outward salivary
flow, once infected the SG may result in a more established and symptomatic infection.
SARS-CoV-2 in saliva correlates with symptoms and supports an oral
axis for COVID-19 pathogenesis.
To investigate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic transmission by saliva, subjects that were COVID-19 positive who were either
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, or asymptomatic subjects at a high
risk of infection were studied. Two groups of subjects were enrolled in the
study (N=36): subjects with a positive NP swab (n=28); or subjects with
high-risk contact (co-habitation, occupational exposure, n=8), two of which
tested positive at the first study visit (Figure 6a,b). Over a 5-week prospective interval, this trial studied the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and
nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and the presence of antibodies against viral
antigens in saliva. Based on the time from their first positive NP swab test,
these data confirmed what others have recently reported54, i.e., that salivary and NP swabs generally correlated for SARS-CoV-2 positivity over
time (Figure 6c,d). However, these data also highlighted novel points in
this outpatient cohort. First, some subjects cleared the virus over very long
periods of time (>2 months since first test to negative NP and saliva tests).
Second, not all truly asymptomatic individuals rapidly clear virus from their

oral infection without maintaining NP infection. (e,f) (e) Evaluation of a pilot set of saliva samples for nucleocapsid and spike antibodies by Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS)

occurred in 50% (18/36 subjects) of the COVID-19 cases and showed a range of antibody levels. (f) In contrast, seropositive spike antibodies were less common with a frequency of 14%
(5/36; Figure 6g). (g) In patients with the highest salivary viral load and reported taste alterations (dysgeusia in CoV19), we observe significant salivary epithelial (pan-cytokeratin positive)

secretions. Of the 36 subjects enrolled in this study to date, 25% reported
no symptoms at all (8/30) with a range of viral of clearance from 0.5 weeks
to 3.5 weeks (average 18 days after first positive NP swab). This rate is
only one week less than in subjects with symptoms, suggesting that some
asymptomatic subjects may carry virus in their nasopharynx and saliva
over extended periods of time. Out of 8 entirely asymptomatic participants,
5 were positive only in their NP swabs including two who developed positive viral loads in the middle of the monitoring period (Supp. Figure 6c).
Two asymptomatic participants, CoV01 and CoV02, displayed only positive
salivary viral signals when matched to NP viral loads 14 days after the positive NP test (Figure 6d). This data highlights that it is possible to clear virus
from the NP while displaying persistent virus in saliva suggesting sustained
shedding of virus from SG or from SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells.
The association of oral infection and COVID-19 symptom was also examined. In symptomatic subjects, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
saliva was positively associated with reported loss of taste and smell (OR:
6.6 [1.229 – 35.438]; p<0.05; Figure 6d; Supp. Table 2) indicating viral
infection of cells of the taste papillae. Moreover, these data are supported
by the saliva cell infection experiments (Supp. Figure 6b) showing two
patients with high viral load in saliva and reported taste changes displayed
significant epithelial (pCK+) cell infection in ACE2 expressing cells (Figure

6h, Supp. Figure 6e,f). Reports of “body ache/muscle pain” was inversely
correlated to saliva viral burden (OR: 0.090 [0.009 - 0.880]; p<0.05; Supp.
Table 2) indicating differential patterns of infection and immune response.
Public health measures, such as universal mask use and social distancing, are intended to reduce droplet transmission. However, few
studies have attempted to directly measure the change in saliva droplets ejection from COVID-19 subjects by wearing a mask. The effectiveness of standard mask wearing to reduce droplet spread in these
subjects was tested and demonstrated decrease in the detection of
expelled droplets >10-fold (p<0.005), including some asymptomatic subjects with positive NP or saliva viral load; although the assay did
not have the sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Supp. Figure 6d).
Saliva is a complex fluid that functions to protect the oral cavity tissues
through a variety of mechanisms, including secreted salivary proteins
and antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) which potentially restrict viral infections (55). However, little is known about the local antibody responses
at the site of infection in the oral cavity for SARS-CoV-2 and only very
recently has the oral cavity been tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
antigens (56). Utilizing the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS)
assay, antibodies were detected to the viral antigens nucleocapsid and
spike in 50% (18/36) and 14% (5/36), respectively, in early recovered

COVID-19 subjects (Figure 6f,g). Surprisingly, several of the
subjects with both nucleocapsid and spike proteins were those
individuals with protracted positivity in NP and saliva, moderate
symptoms, and indica-tors of oral infection (ex: CoV19 in Figure 6h;
CoV23 in Supp. Figure. 6e). The presence of antibodies in saliva may
indicate the presence of local infection in oral cavity tissues. It is now
known that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies exhibit a temporal relationship
with nucleocapsid antibodies developing prior to the detection of
spike antibodies (57). Due to the short-term window of this study,
participants were requested to return at 6-months and 1-year for
antibody surveillance in serum and saliva.
DISCUSSION
Collaborative efforts led by the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) utilized single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets from across the body to
examine cell-specific SARS-CoV-2 tropism, leading to the COVID-19
Cell Atlas (https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/). These and other atlases
point to the permissiveness of the barrier epithelium to SARS-CoV-2
infection (58, 59). While viewed as an important tool, oral scRNAseq
datasets were not included in these efforts. To address this gap in
knowledge, the studies herein are the first integrated adult human oral
scRNAseq atlas and these studies suggest a range of oral infection
susceptibilities that may medi-ate the oral axis in COVID-19
pathogenesis and transmission. Although principally focused on
COVID-19, these data emphasize the unique ana-tomic and cellular
diversity found in the oral cavity and underscore future opportunities to
complete a comprehensive oral and oropharyngeal atlas (Figures 1b, 4;
26, 28).
The COVID-19 integrated oral atlas focused our investigations on the
spe-cialized oral epithelial populations, including first the “secretory”
epithelia of the major and minor SGs (Figure 2; Supp. Figure 1). The
SGs exhibit enriched, albeit low, expression of principal entry factors in
the epithelia and co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found in
0.54%, 0.23%, and 0.71% of mucous, ductal, and myoepithelial cells,
respectively. These percentages are slightly lower than reported for
cells in the respiratory tract but may reflect limitations in the detection
of low-expression genes by scRNAseq. Co-expression of these markers
was more frequent using ISH and emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 is
predicted to have tropism to the acini and ducts. While there has been a
historical focus on major SG viral infections, broad expression of viral
entry factors and significant infection of minor SG epithelia was
confirmed. Minor SGs are widely distributed among the tongue, palate,
and mucosae (60), sites now demonstrated to be hotspots for SARSCoV-2 infection. The novel finding of SG and tongue infection helps
explain acute onset and post-recovery COVID-19 symptoms, such as
dry mouth and taste alterations (14); however, infection and productive
replication in even a majority of these glands may produce no
symptoms, possibly explaining the phenomenon of “silent spreaders” in
COVID-19.
One limitation of our scRNAseq approach was the cellular representation
of the mucosal atlas which enriched for immune cells over
suprabasal squamous epithelial cells (Figure 2; Supp. Figure 1). When
compared to the SG, these results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 would
have relatively little tropism for the mucosa based on the low expression
and abundance of cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRRS2. However,
integrated pan-oral mouse single cell data revealed a more robust
description of the oral cavity due to increased numbers of suprabasal
cells from the tongue (47) and buccal mucosa (46), which exhibited
higher levels of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression compared to basal
epithelial cells. Examination of human gingiva and other oral niches and
found that the Basal 1 population exhibited co-expression of ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 in 0.3% of cells, similar to our ductal cell percentage. Basal
cells eventually delaminate from the suprabasal layer and shed into
saliva (Figure 4; 28). Surprisingly, as delaminating basal cells
differentiate into suprabasal cells, their expression of ACE2 and
TMPRSS family members increased as they were poised to shed into the
oral cavity (Figure 4). This finding suggests the possibility that in some
cases COVID-19 occurs without symptoms since stratified squamous
cells are not linked to specific symptoms and are continuously shed into
saliva (Figure 5,6; 49. These infected, shed oral epithelial cells can
elicit a ro-bust immune response in the mucosa and gut leading to local
production and secretion of antibodies via the oral mucosae and SGs
(63). This axis explains the relationship between oral infection and the
development of robust antibodies detected in saliva in the clinical
dataset (i.e., CoV19, CoV33, Figure 6c-h).

Two independent and complementary datasets from outpatients
revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infected squamous epithelial cells
in saliva, providing a potential cellular mechanism for disease spread
and transmission. The discovery of an oral source of infection and
replication in the SG as well as the natural conduit for viral spread via
saliva establishes the possibility of two infection axes in COVID-19
and highlights how simultaneous testing of oral and nasopharyngeal
sites might be required to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 spread (Figure
1a). However, these results raise new questions about COVID-19
pathogenesis including: 1) whether this is primarily a “nasal-first”
infection that spreads via mucus transport to the oral cavity or 2) the
possibility of an “oral-first” infection via fomite or droplet inoculation, and
3) whether the pattern of infection impacts disease severity and host
immunological responses. To test whether oral transmission can
precede nasal and/or occur in the absence of nasal infection, it will be
necessary to design studies that include daily surveillance using NP and
salivary tests in an at-risk cohort.
Considering now-documented oral SARS-CoV-2 infection and the ease
of saliva for transmission, it remains critical to further our understanding
of the dominant modes of viral spread across the spectrum of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the “Achilles’ Heel” of this pandemic
(64), and asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread has been estimated
to cause to 2.2-45% of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 infections are now
widely accepted to involve airborne droplet transmission based on guidance from the WHO and CDC. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2
infectious particles in the SGs, the oral mucosa, and in saliva raises the
possibility that the oral cavity actively participates in SARS-CoV-2 infection
and transmission (Figure 1a). Finally, these data provide strong evidence
in support of universal public health measures, including mask wearing,
social distancing, and hand washing, to limit exposure to potentially infectious droplets, aerosols, and fomites generated from the oral cavity (Supp.
Figure 6d).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
HUMAN GINGIVAL SINGLE CELL RNA SEQUENCING:
Clinical Protocol: Five subjects were enrolled in this study conducted at the
University of North Carolina Adams School of Dentistry (Chapel Hill, North
Carolina), and 5 total healthy subjects (2 females and 3 males; aged 20 to
30 years) completed the experimental gingivitis protocol in October 2019.
Each subject was determined to be systemically healthy individuals with
mild gingivitis. Subjects received initial prophylaxis (Day 0) with a 3-week
stent-induced, biofilm overgrowth, experimental gingivitis induction phase
over the upper left maxillary premolar and first and second molars only
(Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04105569; UNC IRB: 19-0183). Full-thickness
gingival biopsies (0.3μm3) were collected on the same day from each
subject at the 3-week time point from the upper left maxillary lingual interproximal papilla (universal number #14-15): Biopsy samples were split for
tissue dissociation and tissue fixation.
Cold Protease Dissociation/FACS: Split tissues were placed immediately
in ice cold, calcium-free AND magnesium-free 1x PBS for overnight shaking and incubation with 1:1000 ROCK Inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich; Y27632).
Cold protease dissociation cocktail was made using cold 1x PBS, 2x
DNASE (2.5mg/mL Sigma-Aldrich; 9003-98-9), and 1:1000 ROCK Inhibitor. Protease (Sigma-Aldrich; P5380) was then added to a concentration
of 100mg/mL. Sterilized dissecting forceps (Roboz) were used to mechanically separate gingival into several pieces. Enzymatic cocktail was
incubated with gingival tissues for 35 minutes but progress was checked
every 10 minutes with 10μL. Dissociation was completed when > 75% of
the solution was single cells, then gingival single cells were pelleted at
1800 rcf and washed twice with an appreciable volume of a cocktail of cold
culture medium, 1:1000 Y-27632, and 10% FBS. Following dissociation,
viability was checked using trypan blue (viability was confirmed >80%)
and RBC lysis was achieved using a 1x RBC buffer (Biolegend 420301).
A FACS buffer (mixture of PBS, 1% FBS, and 1:1000 ROCK Inhibitor) was
used throughout the resuspension and cell sorting process. Single cells
were enriched using a 35mm Falcon cell strainer (Thermo Fisher), Before
FACS, the cell pellet was resuspended in the FACS buffer and stored on
ice. To isolate living cells by FACS, Rat anti-CD49f-Alexa Fluor 647 (a6-In-

tegrin, BioLegend clone GoH3) was added to cells and incubated for 60
min on ice. Sytox (Thermo Fisher, 1:1000) was added 5 min before FACS
to evaluate live/dead cells using a Sony SH800S Cell Sorter, with the
following controls: anti- CD49f:Alexa Fluor 647 negative, and Sytox Dead
Cell Stain negative cell suspensions. Cells were sorted ~6 counts/sec, and
live cells were sorted into tubes directly for 10x capture.
10x Capture, Library Prep, Sequencing: Cells were processed using the
10x Genomics Chromium Controller and the Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ
GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (PN-1000075) following the manufacturer’s user guide (https://tinyurl.com/y28bwe67). Briefly, aliquots of the
sorted cells were stained with acridine orange and propidium iodide and
assessed for viability and concentration using the LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems). Approximately 3,200 cells per
sample were loaded onto the Chromium Chip B with a target recovery
of 2,000 cells per sample for library preparation. Single cells, reverse
transcription reagents, and gel beads coated with barcoded oligos were
encapsulated together in an oil droplet to produce gel beads in emulsion
(GEMs). Reverse transcription was performed using a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) to generate cDNA libraries tagged with a cell barcode and
unique molecular index (UMI). GEMs were then broken, and the cDNA
libraries were purified using Dynabeads MyOne SILANE (Invitrogen) prior
to 12 amplification cycles. Amplified libraries were purified with SPRIselect
magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies). Fragmentation,
end repair, A-tailing, and double-sided size selection using SPRIselect
beads were then performed. Illumina-compatible adapters were ligated
onto the size-selected cDNA fragments. Adapter-ligated cDNA was then
purified using SPRIselect beads. Uniquely identifiable indexes were added during 12 amplification cycles. The finalized sequencing libraries were
then purified using SPRIselect beads, visualized using the Bioanalyzer
High Sensitivity DNA chip, quantified with the KAPA SYBR® FAST Universal qPCR Kit for Illumina (Roche) and StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems), normalized to 4 nM, and pooled. Pooled
libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 machine (Illumina). Libraries
were denatured and diluted following standard Illumina protocol, spiked
with 1% PhiX sequencing control (Illumina), loaded onto the flow cell at 1.8
pM, and sequenced in paired-end format (Read 1: 28 bp, Read 2: 91 bp) to
a total depth of 523M read pairs passing quality filters. The 10x Genomics
Cell Ranger analytical pipeline v3.1.0 and GRCh38 v3.0.0 reference package were used to analyze the data following default settings.
HUMAN MINOR SALIVARY GLAND SINGLE CELL RNA SEQUENCING:
Tissue Dissociation: Minor SGs were collected from healthy volunteers
who provided informed consent on NIH protocols 15-D-0051 or 94-D0094. De-identified submandibular and parotid s were obtained fresh from
the Human Cooperative Tissue Network and portioned into RNAlater for
RNA sequencing or were formalin-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
overnight before being transferred to 70% PBS-buffered ethanol (Hewitt
reference), then paraffin-embedded for immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization studies. Five healthy subjects provided minor s biopsies for
single cell RNA sequencing. Tissues were biopsied following standard
methods and immediately placed in ice cold RPMI. Tissues were sharply
dissected into 1-2 mm pieces then dissociated using the Miltenyi Multi-tissue Dissociation Kit A using the Multi_A01 in C-type tubes at 37C in an
octoMacs tissue disruptor using heated sleeves. Crude single cell suspensions were serially filtered through 70 and 30 uM filters and rinsed with
1X-Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution. Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 10
minutes at 4C and washed once with 1X Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution.
Cell counting and viability was determined using a trypan blue exclusion
assay. Suspensions with greater than 35% viability were used for subsequent sequencing. Additional glands from these patients were submitted
for histopathological assessment including focus scoring (DEK).
Single-cell capture, library preparation and sequencing: Single cell suspensions targeting approximately 5,000 cells were prepared as described
above and loaded onto a 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Chip B
following manufacturer’s recommendations. After cell capture, single-cell
library preparation was performed following the instructions for the 10×
Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ kit v3 (10x Genomics). The libraries
were pooled and sequenced on four lanes of a NextSeq500 sequencer
(Illumina), adopting the read configuration indicated by the manufacturer.

Single-cell RNA-seq data processing and quality control: Read processing
was performed using the 10x Genomics workflow. Briefly, the Cell Ranger
v3.0.1 Single-Cell Software Suite was used for demultiplexing, barcode
assignment, and unique molecular identifier (UMI) quantification http://
software.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/overview/welcome). Sequencing
reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome (Genome Reference
Consortium Human Build 38) using a pre-built annotation package obtained from the 10X Genomics website (https://support.10xgenomics.
com/single-cell
geneexpression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/
references). Samples were demultiplexed using the ‘cell ranger mkfastq’
function and gene counts matrices were generated using the ‘cellranger count’ function. The single cell data was analyzed in R (v3.5.0) using
Seurat (v3.1.2). Filtering was performed using the standard quality control
steps provided on the Satija Lab website (satijalab.org). Cells containing
more than 200 and less than 2,500 unique features were retained. From
this set, cells with greater than fifteen percent of read counts attributed to
mitochondrial DNA were filtered out. We adjusted this value from five to
fifteen percent to increase the yield from each sample and did not observe
substantive changes in our results after adjustment. Data were normalized
using the “NormalizeData” command (scale factor = 10,000).
Annotation of clusters: SG cells from n=5 non-Sjögren’s syndrome and
otherwise healthy subjects were integrated into a single Seurat object
containing 12 clusters at resolution=0.1. The clusters were manually annotated with marker genes identified by Seurat’s “FindAllMarkers” function,
using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) test. The “FeaturePlot”
function was used to identify subpopulations within identified clusters and
confirm the expression of known marker genes within clusters.
INTEGRATED SINGLE CELL ANALYSES:
Clustering and Annotation: Oral atlases were retrieved from published and
unpublished datasets (human salivary glands: Warner et al.; human gingiva/palatal mucosa: Byrd et al.). Raw expression matrices were filtered,
normalized and log transformed for further processing using standard
SCANPY (v.1.4.3) procedure (68). For the published mouse datasets,
we considered original publication annotations when re-processing and
annotating cell types. For the two unpublished human datasets, BBKNN
was used for batch correction across samples and multiple clustering
rounds of different resolutions were performed to resolve subpopulations
and then manual annotations were made considering published human
and mouse references (69). For integration across datasets, each individual dataset was first randomly down-sampled to having <=500 cells
per cell type, then pooled raw expression values were re-processed following standard SCANPY procedure while using Harmony for correcting
batch effects across datasets and samples (70). Again, multiple clustering
rounds of different resolutions were performed, and manual annotations
were made. Illustration of the results were generated using python code
around SCANPY.
IHC AND ISH FOR HUMAN ORAL TISSUES AND SALIVA:
Oral and Oropharyngeal Tissue Acquisition: Participant tissues included
remnant oral specimens previously collected through the University of
North Carolina Adams School of Dentistry Oral Pathology Biobank (UNC

Biorepository (UNC IRB: 15-1814). Lab and project personnel were double-blinded and did not have access to PHI or any links to any PHI. Project
members did not have interpersonal contact with patients that provided
specimens. All de-identified tissues were previously fixed in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin blocks.
Saliva cytospin: Saliva samples were collected from COVID-19 patients,
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Then the samples were
centrifuged, and the cell pellet was dissolved into 5mM EDTA in PBS. The
portion of the samples were loaded into disposable sample chambers
(Double cytofunnel, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with slides and
applied into a cytospin machine (Shandon cytospin 4, Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cytospin slides were stored into 70%
ethanol under 4C until IHC or RNA ISH.
Saliva cell blocks: Saliva samples were diluted in 10 volumes of 4%
paraformaldehyde-1XPBS. Cells were allowed to fix for 24-hours at room

temperature. After 5 minutes of centrifugation at 1000xG RPM, cell pellets were transferred to 70% ethanol. Cell pellets were then ensnared by
adding thrombin and fibrin to the cell pellet which could be subsequently
embedded for tissue sectioning.
ISH/IHC: FFPE tissue sections were baked overnight followed by deparaffinization with xylene for 5 minutes twice and dehydration with 100
% ethanol for 1 minutes twice. Then, the sections were incubated with
hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes and antigen retrieval was performed
with boiled water for 15 minutes and with protease at 40C for 15 minutes.
Probes were hybridized at 40C for 2 hours in an oven followed by signal
amplification and washing steps. The hybridized signals were visualized
by Fast Red followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. The probe
targeting human housekeeping gene Ubiquitin C (UBC) was used as a
positive control to test for RNA quality in the tissue sections. A bacterial
gene, Bacillus subtilis dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DapB) was used as
a negative control target. The images were acquired using an Olympus
VS200 slide scanner light microscope with a 60x 1.42 N.A. objective. All
RNAscope® in situ hybridizations were performed following the manufacturer’s recommended conditions with the following exceptions: for in situ
hybridization pretreatment conditions were modified as follows: protease
plus digestion at 40C for 15 min. Antigen retrieval in RNAscope® target
retrieval in slide steamer control temperature at 99C for 15 min.

V-nCoV2019-S (848561) is an antisense probe specific to the Spike protein sequence of the viral RNA so will give information about infection and
viral load in tissue, i.e. the presence of virus.V-nCoV2019-orf1ab-sense
(859151) (40 probe pairs) detect replicating virus. Therefore they can be
used to detect viral replication in tissue. 848561 Was used in the original
set of ISH (Figure 4); and in last set was mixed with 859151 (Figure 5) to
detect both the virus and replication at the same time.
CLINICAL STUDIES:
UNC Epidemiological and Immunological Aspects of COVID-19 Saliva:
A subset of 10 samples from COVID-19 outpatients were collected from
an IRB approved study (PI: Bowman; UNC IRB Number: 20-0792). The
purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology, clinical features,
and immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop new
diagnostic tests focused on saliva. Subjects were individuals >18 years
old who are tested for COVID-19 (NP swab) at UNC Healthcare and contacted as outpatients for sample collection. The subjects in this study were
classified as having “mild” COVID-19. Outpatients were enrolled during
diagnosis at the UNC-CH Respiratory Diagnostic Center (RDC) and re-

cruited no more three days following a positive clinical test. All participants
were asked to come to the RDC for saliva collection, which occurred by
the participant actively drooling into a 5mL collection tube. For all samples,
specimens were evaluated for volume, total cell count, and cell differential
before proceeding to fixation and ISH/IHC analyses.
NIH Transmissibility and Viral Load of SARS-CoV-2 in Oral Secretions.
Subjects providing informed consent to 20-D-0094 (clinicaltrials.gov
NCT04348240) were seen between the hours of 8:30am and 11:00 am
the NIH COVID-19 Testing Center. Before arriving at the testing facility,
subjects were asked to refrain eating 90 minutes before testing. First, subjects were asked to speak by reading Samantha Smith’s “Ambassador of
Peace” address (~2-minute duration, 5th Grade Reading Level) directly
into an emesis bag shortened to a depth of 10 cm with a ¼ section of 3”x3”
Pro-Gauze® Pads (Curad®) dampened with 2 mL of 1X-PBS. Gauze pads
were recovered for saliva and viral burden analysis as described above.
Subjects then repeated the speaking exercise with a disposable procedure
mask on day 1; day 8; and/or 15 (or day 21, or day 28, when applicable.
Whole unstimulated saliva was collected in sterile 50 mL conical vials by
asking patients to refrain from swallowing, allowing the pooling of saliva
under the tongue and in the vestibules of the mouth then pushing the saliva into the open conical vial for 2-3 minutes. A synthetic Copan swab (NP
swab) was used to transfer a standardized amount of saliva from the 50
mL tube to a new 15 mL conical tube containing 3 mL of viral transport
media for CDC SARS-CoV-2 testing. Swabs of the nasopharynx (NP),
were obtained and placed into 15 mL conical tubes containing 3 mL of
viral transport media for CDC SARS-CoV-2 testing. Remaining samples
were immediately placed on ice and transported to the NIH Department of
Laboratory Medicine for testing and cryostorage. Symptom questionnaires
were collected at consent, and again every 2-3 days over the course of
the study.
CDC qRT-PCR test for testing the NP swabs and Saliva. In response to the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time PCR Diagnostic
Panel has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
and has been adopted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical
Center, herein referred to as the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay (71). The
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay is used to screen NP and OP swab specimens in VTM and BAL for SARS-CoV-2 from patients with respiratory
symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay implemented at NIH Clinical
Center utilizes the easyMAG automated nucleic acid extractor (bioMérieux,
Marcy l’Etoile, France). A Taqman assay using two primer/probe sets is
used to detect two distinct regions of the N gene (nucleocapsid protein,
referred to as N1 and N2) and an internal control to detect the human
RNase P (RP1) gene present in all specimen collections. This assay was
performed on the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA).
PROCUREMENT AND TESTING OF AUTOPSY TISSUE SPECIMENS
FOR SARS-COV-2:
Autopsy Tissues. Consent for autopsies of COVID-19 victims was coordinated by the NIH COVID-19 Autopsy Consortium and obtained from family
members. Autopsies were performed in the NCI Laboratory of Pathology
and tissues were recovered in accordance with family wishes for histopathological and other downstream analyses.
Viral Quantification of Autopsy Tissues. Total RNA was extracted from
RNAlater (Invitrogen, Hampton, NH, USA) preserved tissues collected at
autopsy using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown,
MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Prior to extraction,
tissues were mechanically homogenized on the GentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (Miltenyi Biotec Inc, Auburn, CA, USA) using the
gentleMACS M tubes with the RNA_02 program. The NanoDrop ND-1000
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to
quantify RNA concentrations. The QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR
System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to detect and quantify
SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the SARS-CoV-2 Droplet Digital PCR Kit (BioRad), which contains a triplex assay of primers/probes aligned to the CDC
markers for SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 genes and human RPP30 gene. 96
well plates were prepared with technical replicates of up to 550 ng RNA
per well using the aforementioned kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. The QX200 Automated Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,

USA) provided microdroplet generation and plates were sealed with the
PX1 PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) before proceeding
with RT-PCR on the C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read on
the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and analyzed
using the freely available QuantaSoft Analysis Pro Software (Bio-Rad) to
quantify copies of N1, N2, and RP genes per well, which was then normalized to RNA concentration input. For samples to be considered positive for
SARS-CoV-2 N1 or N2 genes, they needed to average the manufacturer’s
limit of detection of >/= 0.1 copies/µL and 2 positive droplets per well.
SALIVARY MEASUREMENT OF ANTIBODIES
AGAINST THE SARS-COV-2 PROTEINS
The luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) immunoassay was
used to study IgG antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in saliva.
Due to the potential biohazard of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and
a viral inactivation protocol involving heating saliva at 56 C o for 30 min
was employed. For these SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements, Renilla
luciferase-nucleocapsid and Gaussia luciferase-spike fusion protein extracts were employed with protein A/G beads as the IgG capture reagent
as previously described (72). Due to the lower levels of immunoglobulin
present in saliva, 10 uL of each saliva sample was utilized in the LIPS
assay as previously described (73). Known SARS-CoV-2 serum samples
for IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid and spike proteins and saliva from
uninfected controls were used for assigning seropositive cut-off values and
for standardization.

Supp. Figure 1 | Distinct oral cell type signatures are found in human oral tissue niches (a) Using unpublished data sets, UMAPs of single cell RNA sequencing data from dissociated
gingiva and minor saliva glands delineates cell population contribution by sample and cell type annotation. We found 22 populations in the glands (3370 cells included) and 28 populations
in the gingiva (5340 cells). Labial minor SGs were procured from patients having biopsies for the clinical workup of Sjögren’s Syndrome who did not meet classification criteria and were
otherwise healthy, including lacking SSA/SSB autoantibodies, and without focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. Mucosal tissues including the gingiva and hard palate were harvested from four 20
to 30-year-old healthy subjects who were given a stent that prevented brushing only on three maxillary teeth to induce a very localized gingivitis (65, 66). (b) The top three defining minor
SG atlas genes expressed in each annotated cluster reveal unique epithelial and immune cell heterogeneity. This includes 5 epithelia cell populations and (2 macrophage populations,
2 cytotoxic T cell populations). These annotations serve as niche atlases but also the reference for the human pan-oral atlas in Figure 2. (c) The top three defining gingival atlas genes
expressed in each annotated cluster reveal significant epithelial and immune cell heterogeneity. This includes at least 7 populations of oral epithelial basal cells (Basal 1-4, Basal cycling;
Merkel Cells, and Melanocytes) and 15 immune cell subsets (3 DC subsets, 7 T cell subsets).

Supp. Figure 2 | Cluster correlation analyses of oral atlases supports further exploration. (a) Correlation mapping between human gingival and saliva gland cell clusters (see Supp.
Figure 1) reveal expectedly invariant clusters are well matched between samples (B cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, smooth muscle, helper T cells, arterial cells). However, numerous other
cell annotation heterogeneities remain to be further explored (Mac1, Mac2 in saliva glands; Basal 1-4 in gingiva). (b) Similar correlation mapping between mouse and human pan-oral
joint annotations support similarities and unique differences between cell clusters between species. B cells again are well correlated as are fibroblasts, myoepithelium, and macrophages.
However, the overlap in endothelial populations from mice into arterial, capillary, lymphatic, pericyte, venule, and smooth muscle human clusters suggests more cells are suggests that either
further exploration of the mouse oral blood vessel populations at higher resolution, or that universal nomenclature of cell types is needed. Additionally, other matched scRNAseq sites in
humans (adding dorsal tongue, buccal mucosa, tonsil, major saliva glands) and mice (adding gingiva and hard palate) will also better relate newly discovered populations.

Supp. Figure 3 | An integrated murine pan-oral cell atlas supports cell heterogeneity. (a,b) Individual single cell datasets from mice were normalized and reannotated before
integration. We found 10 populations in the parotid gland (438 cells included), 8 populations in the submandibular gland (763 cells), 9 populations in the dorsal tongue (3610 cells), and 6
populations (1661 cells), some of which were not originally reported. These 33 populations were jointly annotated to represent 21 populations in the pan-oral atlas. (b) Using published data
sets (46-48, 67), we integrated across available single cell RNA sequencing datasets to describe the cell types vulnerabilities in mouse oral cavity tissues. (Left) UMAPs of dorsal tongue,
buccal mucosa, submandibular gland, and parotid gland by color highlights tissue contribution. (Right) Joint annotation finds both shared and unique cell types (e.g., filiform and fungiform
epithelia) across expected tissue compartments (epithelia, lamina propria, and immune cell populations). (c) Dot plot expression matrix visualization of the integrated mouse oral atlas shows
that cell types are distinguished by unique transcripts, some of which are previously undescribed.

Supp. Figure 4 | Validation of SARS-CoV-2 expression patterning across oral niches. (a) Immunofluorescent (IF) confocal microscopy demonstrated AQP5 (red, acini) colocalization
with ACE2 (green) reveal that ACE2 is enriched on the apical (luminal) and basolateral membranes and is concentrated in the SG acini/ducts (labeled ‘a’ or ‘d’). White arrows indicate
colocalization between ACE2 and AQP5. ACE2 is also expressed to a similar degree in the saliva gland ducts but rarely expressed in myoepithelial cells circumscribing the acini (data
not shown). (b-d) (b) Using healthy volunteer gland sections, the unique minimal TMPRSS11D expression in ducts and acini was confirmed using RNAscope® in situ hybridization. (c,d)
To further confirm co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, RNAscope® fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for pan-cytokeratin (pCK), shows that acini and ducts
co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 further highlighting their vulnerability to infection in (c) minor and (d) parotid saliva glands. (e) Analysis of available bulk RNA sequencing data suggests
that the minor (minor) and parotid (PG) saliva glands are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to the submandibular glands (SMG). The minor glands express ~3x higher ACE2
compared to the major glands. For comparison, the gland express an equivalent amount of TMPRSS2 across all three glands samples. (f) Considering the unique niches of the oral cavity,
we used ISH mapping for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, see Figure 4) across the oral (buccal mucosa, ventral tongue, and the dorsal tongue) as well as examining the
oropharynx for the first time (soft palate, tonsils). This again supports oral niche heterogeneity and that all sites are vulnerable to infection in suprabasal cells that are sloughed into saliva.

Supp. Figure 5 | An oral infection axis occurs via glands and suprabasal epithelia. (a) In situ hybridization (ISH) also reveals infection in the major parotid gland (PG).(b) Microscopic
assessment of the COVID-19 saliva glands by H&E reveals variable histological presentations including atrophy and fibrosis. (c) Viral load in minor saliva glands is generally higher when
compared to glands using ddPCR. (d) Shed cells in saliva display unique TMPRSS family heterogeneity, which we also observed in tissue-specific oral atlases for glands and mucosa.
Saliva glands express the highest TMPRSS2 in mouse and human atlases, and some shed epithelial cells express similar patterns, suggesting they may be shed from the SG ducts. Others,
express higher TMPRSS4, suggesting these cells may be from the suprabasal mucosa. (e-f) (e) ISH mapping validation pipeline for discovering epithelial expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry
factor expression in shedding suprabasal cells, first starting with H&E histochemical staining. (f) ISH was used with negative and positive probe controls. (g) Ciliated cells in saliva are

Supp. Figure 6 | Prospective clinical sampling confirms epithelial cell infection. (a) Using a recently pre-printed salivary neutrophil atlas from healthy patients50, we confirm that
virtually no neutrophils express SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Neutrophils constitute ~50% of salivary cells and epithelial cells the other 50% with trace amounts of lymphocytes and
other cell populations. (b) Using cell blocks of heathy saliva, we validate our findings that shed salivary epithelial (pan-cytokeratin positive; pCK+) cells express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
We see minimal to no expression of these SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in pCK-negative cells. (c) From the NIH Car Line study, the majority of asymptomatic subjects only displayed NP swab
positivity, including two patients who developed symptoms during the prospective sampling (CoV12 and CoV13). (d) Taking this cohort of asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects, infectious
saliva fraction was measured with masks and unmasked highlighting the need for masks to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via saliva droplets. While obvious, this measure highlights
the ability to prevent the spread of the oral infection axis (see Cov01 saliva ejection with no mask ‘none’). (e,f) (e) We confirm our findings from the UNC OBS-C study and from NIH Car
Line study that highest saliva viral load and reported taste alterations (dysgeusia in CoV19), we observe significant salivary epithelial (pCK+)cells; See also Figure 6h. (f) results of pol and
spike quantification of salivary cell infection among 3 samples show consistency of the infection quantification method. Scale bars: (a,e) 25μm.
