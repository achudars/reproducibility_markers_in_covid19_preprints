Abstract

48

Background. Several studies have reported that the severe acute respiratory syndrome

49

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly infect endothelial cells, and endothelial dysfunction

50

is often found in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To better understand

51

the pathological mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19-associated

52

coagulopathy, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess biomarkers of

53

endothelial cells in patients with COVID-19.

54

Methods. A literature search was conducted on online databases for observational studies

55

evaluating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and composite poor outcomes in COVID-19

56

patients.

57

Results. A total of 1187 patients from 17 studies were included in this analysis. The estimated

58

pooled means for von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen levels in COVID-19 patients was higher

59

compared to healthy control (306.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 291.37-321.48], p<0.001;

60

I2:86%), with the highest VWF antigen levels was found in deceased COVID-19 patients (448.57

61

[95% CI 407.20-489.93], p<0.001; I2:0%). Meta-analysis showed that higher plasma levels of

62

VWF antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1

63

antigen (PAI-1) antigen, and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) were associated with composite

64

poor outcome in COVID-19 patients ([standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.74 [0.33-1.16],

65

p<0.001; I2:80.4%], [SMD 0.55 [0.19-0.92], p=0.003; I2:6.4%], [SMD 0.33 [0.04-0.62], p=0.025;

66

I2:7.9%], and [SMD 0.55 [0.10-0.99], p=0.015; I2:23.6%], respectively).

67

Conclusion. The estimated pooled means shows increased levels of VWF antigen in COVID-19

68

patients. Several biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, including VFW antigen, t-PA, PAI-1,

69

and sTM, are significantly associated with increased composite poor outcome in patients with

70

COVID-19.

Introduction

75

Although initially recognized as a disease affecting the respiratory system, the coronavirus

76

disease 2019 (COVID-19) often manifests as cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis,

77

myocardial injuries, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism events (VTE) [1]. There are

78

several possible mechanisms for these phenomena, one of which may be an unrestrained and

79

unbalanced innate immune response, which in turn negates effective adaptive immunity,

80

supporting the progression of COVID-19. Frequent laboratory abnormalities in patients with

81

unfavorable progression of COVID-19 include abnormal cytokine profiles, which led to the

82

initial presumption that the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome

83

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection involved a cytokine storm [2]. However, recent evidence

84

suggests that increased inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with

85

severe and critical COVID-19 are significantly lower compared to patients with sepsis and

86

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not associated with COVID-19, thus doubting the

87

role of a cytokine storm in COVID-19-related multiple organ damage [3].

88

Several studies have reported that the SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endothelial cells, and

89

endothelial dysfunction is often found in severe cases of COVID-19 [4]. Autopsy findings have

90

also demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and microvascular thrombosis, together with

91

pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep-vein thrombosis in COVID-19 patients [5]. These findings

92

suggest that endothelial injury, endotheliitis, and microcirculatory dysfunction in different

93

vascular beds contribute significantly to life-threatening complications of COVID-19, such as

94

VTE and multiple organ involvement [6]. To better understand the pathological mechanisms

95

underlying endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, we conducted a

96

systematic review and meta-analysis to assess biomarkers of endothelial cells in patients with

97

COVID-19.

Methods

99

Search strategy and study selection

100

A systematic literature search of PubMed, PMC Europe, and the Cochrane Library Database

101

from 1 January 2020 to 20 December 2020 was performed using the search strategy outlined

102

in Supplementary Table S1. Additional records were retrieved from Google Scholar. Duplicate

103

articles were removed after the initial search. Two authors (MJA and YA) independently

104

screened the title and abstract of the articles. Articles that passed the screening were assessed

105

in full text based on the eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with

106

the senior author (A). This study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Item for

107

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement and registered with the

108

International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (registration

109

number CRD42021228821).

110

Eligibility criteria

111

We included all observational studies examining biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and

112

outcomes from patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using the reverse transcription-

113

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The following types of articles were excluded from

114

the analysis: case reports, review articles, non-English language articles, research articles on

115

the pediatric population, animal or in-vitro studies, unpublished studies, and studies with

116

irrelevant or non-extractable results.

117

Data collection process

118

Data extraction was carried out by two authors (MJA and YA) independently using piloted data

119

extraction forms consisting of the author, year of publication, study design, number and

120

characteristics of samples, levels of several biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, and patient

121

outcomes. The biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction analyzed in this study were von

122

Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen

123

activator inhibitor-1 antigen (PAI-1), and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM). The primary

124

endpoint was composite poor outcomes consisting of ICU admission, severe illness, worsening

125

of the respiratory status, the need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Moreover, if the

126

included studies reported the data using median and quartile values, we used the formula

127

developed by Wan et al. to estimate mean and standard deviation [7]. Disease severity was

128

defined based on the WHO R&D Blueprint on COVID-19 [8].

129

Quality assessment

130

The quality and risk of bias assessment of included studies were conducted using the

131

Newcastle-Ottawa score (NOS) [9] by all authors independently, and discrepancies were

132

resolved through discussion. This scoring system consists of three domains: the selection of

133

sample cohorts, comparability of cohorts, and assessment of outcomes (Supplementary Table

134

S2).

135

Data analysis

136

Stata software V.14.0 (College Station) was used for meta-analysis, and figure of estimated

137

pooled means were produced using GraphPad Prism 9. We pooled multiple means and

138

standard errors of the same population characteristic from different studies into a single

139

group using the fixed-effect model of meta-analysis algorithm. Pooled effect estimates of the

140

outcomes were reported as standardized means differences (SMD). Fixed-effects and

141

random-effects models were used for pooled analysis with low heterogeneity (I2 statistic <50%

142

or P-value <0.1) and high heterogeneity (I2 statistic> 50% or P-value ≤ 0.1), respectively.

143

Statistical significance was determined with P-value < 0.05. We performed a sensitivity

144

analysis to test the robustness of the pooled effect estimates for VWF antigen levels by

145

excluding each study sequentially and rerunning the meta-analysis. The funnel-plot analysis

146

was used to assess the symmetrical distribution of effect sizes, and the regression-based Egger

147

test was performed to assess publication bias on continuous endpoints.

Results

149

Study characteristics

150

We identified 697 articles from the database search, and 492 articles remained after the

151

duplication was removed. Screening on titles and abstracts excluded 465 articles, and the

152

remaining 27 full-text articles were assessed according to eligibility criteria. As a result, 17

153

studies [10–26] with a total of 1187 patients were subjected to qualitative analysis and meta-

154

analysis (Figure 1 and Table 1). Quality assessment with NOS showed that 13 studies [10,13–

155

19,21–24,26] were of good quality with ≥ 7 NOS score and four studies [11,12,20,25] were

156

considered as moderate quality with six NOS score (Supplementary Table S2).

157

Biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and outcome

158

There was an increase in the VWF antigen levels in COVID-19 patients with different levels for

159

each outcome group of COVID-19 patients. The pooled means plasma levels of VWF antigen

160

in COVID-19 patients treated at the general wards and ICU patients or severely ill patients

161

([306.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 291.37-321.48], p<0.001; I2:86%] and [398.56 [95% CI

162

386.84-410.30], p<0.001; I2:92%], respectively) were higher than healthy controls (103.24

163

[95% CI 91.31-115.17], p<0.001; I2:0%). Moreover, deceased COVID-19 patients had the

164

highest pooled means of VWF antigen levels (448.57 [95% CI 407.20-489.93], p<0.001; I2:0%)

165

(Figure 2).

166

Meta-analysis showed that higher plasma levels of VWF antigen was associated with

167

composite poor outcome (SMD 0.74 [0.33-1.16], p<0.001; I2:80.4%). Patients with poor

168

outcome had significantly a higher level of t-PA and PAI-1 antigen compared to patients with

169

good outcomes ([SMD 0.55 [0.19-0.92], p=0.003; I2:6.4%] and [SMD 0.33 [0.04-0.62], p=0.025;

170

I2:7.9%], respectively). The plasma levels of sTM were found to be higher in COVID-19 patients

171

with poor outcome ([SMD 0.55 [0.10-0.99], p=0.015; I2:23.6%]) (Figure 3).

172

We found substantial heterogeneity for VWF antigen analysis (I2:80.4%) and low

173

heterogeneity for t-PA, PAI-1 antigen, and sTM analysis (I2:6.4%, I2:7.9%, and I2:23.6%,

174

respectively). However, subgroup analyses to evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity of

175

VWF levels were not performed due to the small amount of primary data included in the group

176

analysis. The sensitivity analysis of VWF levels after excluding two studies [19,24] at risk of

177

bias decreased the heterogeneity considerably while maintaining the significance of pooled

178

effect estimate (SMD 0.34 [0.17-0.62], p <0.001; I2:9.2%).

179

Publication bias

180

The visual assessment of the funnel plot showed an asymmetrical shape for the analysis of the

181

vWF antigen levels, which indicated the possibility of publication bias (Figure 4). This

182

asymmetrical shape was due to the inclusion of the studies by Goshua et al. [19] and Mancini

183

et al. [24]. However, quantitative analysis using regression-based Egger’s test for the same

184

variable showed no significant result of small-study effects (p=0.063). Regression-based

185

Harbord’s test for other biomarkers and composite poor outcome also showed no significant

186

result of small-study effects.

Discussion

188

A single layer of healthy endothelial cells lines the entire vascular system and plays an

189

essential role in maintaining laminar blood flow. This is attributed to its anti-inflammatory

190

properties and non-thrombotic surface with vasodilatory homeostasis [27]. Under normal

191

conditions, the endothelium is impermeable to large molecules, inhibits adhesion of

192

leukocytes, provides anti-inflammatory properties, prevents thrombosis, and promotes

193

vasodilation. Conditions that cause endothelial activation, such as infection, inflammation, or

194

other insults, support proatherogenic mechanisms that promote plaque development by

195

stimulating thrombin formation, coagulation, and deposition of fibrin in blood vessel walls

196

[28].

197

Endothelial dysfunction is one of the manifestations of COVID-19, leading to various systemic

198

complications through several mechanisms. Preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2

199

directly infects endothelial cells due to the high expression of the angiotensin-converting

200

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). After binding to

201

SARS-CoV-2, the ACE2 receptor is internalized and downregulated, which causes a reduction

202

of ACE2 expression in the surface of endothelial cells [2]. Inflammation in COVID-19 activates

203

the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) either directly by increasing angiotensin I or indirectly due

204

to the reduction of ACE2 expression on the surface of the endothelial cells. Reduced ACE2 will

205

inhibit the hydrolysis of angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), a vasoactive

206

ligand of the Mas receptor (MasR), which exhibit anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and anti-

207

fibrosis effects. Reduced activation of MasR will increase the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R)

208

activation, thereby perpetuating the proinflammatory phenotype [29]. In addition, AT1R

209

activation and direct viral infection of endothelial cells can increase reactive oxygen species

210

(ROS) generation via activation of NADPH and activate nuclear factor kappa B, thereby

211

reducing nitric oxide (NO) production [4]. Porcine animal models have recently revealed a

212

vicious self-perpetuating pathway, whereby ROS production increases expression of ET-1,

213

which results in further ROS production. Increased vWF expression has also been shown to

214

increase ET-1 expression, alternatively, knockdown of vWF expression has been shown to

215

decrease AngII-induced-ET-1 production [30]. Decreased ACE2 levels can also promote

216

prothrombotic signaling by limiting the degradation of des-Arg9 bradykinin, thereby

217

increasing the activated bradykinin receptors [31].

218

Activation of several proinflammatory cytokine receptors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha

219

(TNF-α) and IL-6 can directly or indirectly interfere with endothelial function. TNF-α can

220

increase hyaluronic acid deposition in the extracellular matrix and cause fluid retention,

221

whereas IL-6 increases vascular permeability and promote the secretion of proinflammatory

222

cytokines by endothelial cells [32]. Subsequently, TNF-α and IL-6 induce the adhesive

223

phenotype of endothelial cells and promote neutrophil infiltration, resulting in multiple

224

histotoxic mediators, including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and ROS to be produced,

225

which eventually leads to endothelial cell injury. Activated endothelial cells stimulate

226

coagulation by expressing fibrinogen, VWF, and P-selectin [32,33]. Activated endothelial by

227

inflammatory stimuli can also induce thrombosis by favoring the expression of antifibrinolytics

228

(e.g., PAI-1) and procoagulants (e.g., tissue factor) over the expression of profibrinolytic

229

mediators (e.g., t-PA) and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin-like molecules and thrombomodulin)

230

[28]. Taken together, these mechanisms contribute to massive platelet binding and formation

231

of fibrin, leading to deposition of blood clots in the microvasculature and systemic thrombosis

232

[2]. However, viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the blood [34], which suggests that

233

rather than direct viral infection of endothelial cells, additional host-dependence factors may

234

contribute to systemic endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy in COVID-19.

235

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multidomain adhesive glycoprotein produced by

236

megakaryocytes and endothelial cells. It binds to platelet glycoproteins Ibα, αIIbβ3, and

237

subendothelial collagen to activate platelets and initiate platelet aggregation [35]. Endothelial

238

cell-derived VWF contributes to VWF-dependent atherosclerosis by increasing vascular

239

inflammation and platelet adhesion and [36]. COVID-19 and endothelial activation of VWF are

240

recognized as acute-phase proteins released from endothelial cells in response to

241

inflammation [37], but high levels of VWF, in this case, indicated a suspicion of endothelial

242

disturbance [38]. Expression of VWF and its release from the Weibel-Palade body of

243

endothelial cells may also be stimulated by hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced upregulation of VWF is

244

associated with the presence of thrombus in cardiac and pulmonary vessels that promotes

245

leukocyte recruitment [39]. Since VWF is a significant determinant of platelet adhesion after

246

the vascular injury leading to clot formation, high plasma levels of VWF antigen are an

247

independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction [40].

248

Several studies have shown that COVID-19 patients have higher plasma levels of VWF antigen

249

than healthy controls [10,12,18,41]. The pooled means of VWF antigen levels in COVID-19

250

patients obtained in this study were higher than VWF levels reported in patients with acute

251

coronary syndromes [42,43], acute ischemic stroke [44], and active ulcerative colitis [45].

252

Meanwhile, similar levels of VWF antigen were reported in patients with disseminated

253

intravascular coagulation [46], severe sepsis, and septic shock not associated with COVID-19

254

[47,48], thus supporting the role of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19-induced organ

255

dysfunction. In addition to the VWF antigen, VWF activity has also been shown to increase in

256

COVID-19 patients, thus further explaining the role of endothelial cell injury in COVID-19-

257

associated coagulopathy [12,18,20,22].

The procoagulant state resulting from endothelial activation can also be measured from

259

changes in the balance of tissue plasminogen activator and its endogenous inhibitor. Activated

260

endothelial cells produce increased levels of PAI-1, which inhibits the activity of t-PA and

261

urokinase-type plasminogen activator, causing a shift from the hemostatic balance towards

262

the procoagulant state [49]. Increased levels of PAI-1 produced by endothelial cells and

263

possibly other tissues, such as adipose tissue, are risk factors for atherosclerosis and

264

thrombosis [27]. A study by Nougier et al. demonstrated that an impaired balance of

265

coagulation and fibrinolysis in COVID-19 patients with significant hypercoagulability was

266

associated with hypofibrinolysis caused by increased plasma levels of PAI-1 [26]. In COVID-19

267

patients, plasma levels of PAI-1 were found to be 3.7 times higher than in healthy controls

268

[41]. A study by Kang et al. demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory

269

dysfunction had significantly higher levels of PAI-1 compared to patients with burns, ARDS,

270

and sepsis [50]. In addition to endothelial activation due to proinflammatory cytokines, direct

271

infection by SARS-CoV-2 may cause endotheliitis, which indicates vascular endothelial

272

damage, thereby potentiating t-PA and PAI-1 release [51].

273

Soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) is a soluble form in the plasma as the result of proteolytic

274

cleavage of the intact thrombomodulin protein from the surface of endothelial cells after

275

endothelial injury and dysfunction, such as inflammation, sepsis, ARDS, and atherosclerosis.

276

Thrombomodulin is a vasculoprotective integral membrane type-1 glycoprotein that plays a

277

vital role in endothelial thromboresistance [52]. The thrombomodulin-mediated binding will

278

activate protein C, which provides anti-inflammatory, antifibrinolytic, and anticoagulant

279

benefits for blood vessel walls [53]. In the hyperinflammatory state, increased sTM levels

280

could be due to direct damage to the endothelial cells [54]. Elevated plasma levels of sTM

281

have also been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating

282

endothelial injury [55]. The plasma levels of sTM might be too low to have an impact on the

283

coagulation process, but the consistent increase in sTM levels during pathologies has been

284

widely considered a biomarker for endothelial dysfunction and vascular risk assessment [52].

285

Although the relative impact of thrombomodulin release due to endothelial injury in COVID-

286

19 will require further research, several studies have reported the role of sTM as a prognostic

287

biomarker in COVID-19 patients [16,19]. These findings support the hypothesis of

288

endotheliopathy as an important event in the transition to severity and mortality in COVID-19

289

patients.

290

Impact for clinical practice

291

The elevated biomarkers of endothelial cells, which indicate a manifestation of endothelial

292

dysfunction in COVID-19, might increase the risk of vascular complications, poor outcomes,

293

and death. Plasma levels of VWF antigen, t-PA, PAI-1, and sTM can be used as laboratory

294

markers for vascular risk assessment and predictors of poor outcome in COVID-19.

295

Limitation

296

One of the 17 studies included in this meta-analysis was a preprint article. Nevertheless, a

297

thorough assessment has been made to make sure that only sound studies are included. Most

298

of the included studies had a retrospective observational design, and the data were not

299

sufficiently matched or adjusted for confounders. Moreover, our primary endpoints of

300

composite poor outcomes vary widely from ICU admission, severe illness, worsening of the

301

respiratory status, the need for mechanical ventilation to death. Therefore, the results must

302

be cautiously interpreted.

Conclusion

304

There was an increase in the VWF antigen levels in COVID-19 patients, and the highest levels

305

of VWF antigen were found in deceased COVID-19 patients. Biomarkers of endothelial

306

dysfunction, including VWF antigen, t-PA, PAI-1 antigen, and sTM, are significantly associated

307

with an increased composite poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.
