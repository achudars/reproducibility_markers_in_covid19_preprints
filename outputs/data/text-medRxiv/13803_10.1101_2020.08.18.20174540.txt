ABSTRACT

19

Introduction

20

The shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the country has been widely

21

discussed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE

22

shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have

23

been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of

24

adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally

25

distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were

26

not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born

27

from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article

28

discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its

29

immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE.

30
31

Methods

32

The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel

33

mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more

34

pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their

35

respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by

36

qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas

37

City, KS as a proof of concept.

40

Results

41

At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not

42

able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested,

43

all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral/bacterial filter

44

combination.

45
46

Conclusion

47

The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive

48

testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing

49

caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results.

50

The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other

51

PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire

52

PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.

INTRODUCTION

56

Background

57

In December of 2019 the first cases of a novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, were

58

reported in China.1 As the virus spread across the continent, it proved to be both highly

59

contagious and highly virulent.1 Some infected patients were suffering from acute respiratory

60

distress syndrome (ARDS).1 By the middle of March 2020, the World Health Organization had

61

designated the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Reports of not only strained economies but

62

also strained global healthcare systems flooded the news.2 Within healthcare settings, the focus

63

shifted to the adequacy of personal protective equipment (PPE).3

64
65
66

PPE Shortages
The shortage of PPE across the country has been widely discussed by government

67

officials and healthcare practitioners as well as the general population.3-5 Unfortunately, recent

68

reports indicate the supply of PPE “is running low again as the virus resumes its rapid spread

69

and the number of hospitalized patients climbs.”6 Although the situation has improved since it

70

was first evaluated earlier in the year, many experts predict that shortages persist.7 Additionally,

71

some predict that it may take years in order for stockpiles to fully replenish, an increasingly

72

urgent challenge as cases continue to rise across the United States.7 Shortages of PPE have

73

repeatedly been shown to contribute to the spread of the virus, and “the situation is especially

74

dire at hospitals serving communities of color or patients on Medicaid.”8

Fit Testing
In addition to PPE shortages, various studies have commented on difficulties regarding

79

inadequate mask fitting.9,10 Mask fit is an important consideration of mask efficacy and is

80

typically measured by either qualitative fit-tests (QLFT) or quantitative fit-tests (QNFT).9 In

81

qualitative fit-tests, mask wearers are tested to see if they can detect bitter or sweet scents

82

aerosolized around the masked wearer, whereas quantitative fit-tests measure ratios of ambient

83

aerosols inside and outside of the mask.9 A 2018 Korean study reported QNFT pass rates of the

84

four most common N95 models to be below 50%, with poorer fit test results observed for women

85

compared to men.10 The inherent challenge of the possibility of a poor mask fit is magnified

86

during pandemic settings due to time pressures and limited availability of options.

87
88
89

3D Printed Alternatives
As the aforementioned issues with PPE were playing out, communities of 3D printing

90

aficionados, colloquially known as “makers,” began to discuss the issue and created homemade

91

masks, face shields, and gowns. Specifically, those with access to 3D printers were encouraged

92

to continually run their machines to produce face-shields and masks that could be used in the

93

health care sector. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to

94

pursue 3D print and locally distribute masks to assist in reducing PPE shortages. The widespread

95

availability of 3D printers and cost-effective nature of the manufacturing process makes it

96

excellent for such purposes.

97

The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available

98

snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage, or

99

more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at

their respective facilities. This article focuses on the design, manufacture, and validation of the

101

snorkel mask adapter design and its usage in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future usage as

102

stopgap PPE.

METHODS

105

Adapter Design

106

The adapter was designed to connect an OceanReef snorkel mask to a Hudson RCI In-

107

Line Bacterial/Viral Filter11 commonly found in both operating rooms and intensive care units

108

for filtration and humidification of air in mechanically ventilated patients. These filters were

109

chosen for their cost-effective nature, high availability during PPE shortages, and low resistance

110

to gas flow while maintaining 99.99% filtration efficiency.11 The assembled design is shown in

111

Figure 1 and the 3D printed adapter is shown in Figure 2.

Design and 3D Printing
This design was generated using commercial CAD software and exported to an Standard

120

Tessellation Language (STL) file for compatibility with hobbyist 3D printer workflows. These

121

workflows use a “slicer” software to convert the universal STL file into GCODE that is specific

122

to an individual 3D printer. Two combinations of slicer and 3D printer were tested: the Cura

123

slicer was used to prepare GCODE for a Lulzbot Taz5, and PrusaSlicer was used to prepare

124

GCODE for a Creality CR-10S. Adapters were printed in a variety of filaments including

125

Polylactic acid (PLA), Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PET-G), and Thermoplastic

polyurethane (TPU). Polylactic acid (PLA) was chosen given its melting point, ease of use, and

127

cost effectiveness. Print settings shown in Table 1 were used. However, these may vary based on

128

software and printer. For most printers, the default PLA settings will be sufficient.

Usage and Fit Testing
Before being taken in for formal qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of

133

Kansas Health System (TUKHS), a water seal test was performed. The wearer donned the mask,

134

adapter, and viral filter combination and was submerged into water such that the water level was

135

above the connection of the filter to the adapter, but below the top of the filter. This was done to

136

allow for identification of leaks in the system. If the wearer felt water entering the mask or if air

137

was seen escaping in the adapter fitment the model was identified as not air or water tight. This

138

test was only performed before a version of the adapter was sent for QLFT at TUKHS.

139
140

At TUKHS, the design was fit tested by the facilities staff using a standard saccharin
solution aerosol protocol. At TUKHS, participants were those who were not able to pass fit

141

testing with the standard N95 respirators available at TUKHS. None of the designers of the

142

adapter or authors of this paper were present for fit testing, to ensure an unbiased fit test.

143
144
145

Study Design
IRB approval was not requested nor required for this study because this was essentially a

146

proof of concept and quality improvement initiative. The design went through the proper

147

channels at TUKHS for testing and approval of PPE during the height of the pandemic. Although

148

further analysis and study to prove efficacy is required, the purpose of this study and article is to

149

discuss the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter concept.

150
151

RESULTS

152

At TUKHS, 3832 people have been fit tested at least once for standard half face

153

respirators. Of these, 211 people are currently listed as powered air purifying respirator (PAPR)

154

only, placing a significant load on access to PAPR devices. The snorkel mask, adapter, and viral

155

filter combination was fit tested on 22 individuals of the 3832 people who required an N95 mask

156

but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time.

157

Three sizes of Ocean Reef Uno snorkel masks were used: S/M, M/L, L/XL. Of the 22 individuals

158

tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask (one of 3 sizes), adapter,

159

and Hudson RCI viral/bacterial filter combination. It was deemed appropriate that five of these

160

22 individuals were given snorkel masks, adapters, and filters to use as necessary.

164

DISCUSSION
The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More

165

extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. However, the initial

166

results suggest that this mask could be efficacious at a larger scale. Of those who passed

167

qualitative fit testing (QLFT) (N = 463) with all N95 FFR models, 86.9% (N = 459) also passed

168

quantitative fit testing. This suggest that qualitative fit testing, although less rigorous than

169

quantitative fit testing, does correlate highly with proper mask fitment.9

170

Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination

171

of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of

172

traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to

173

be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with

174

conventional PPE.
