Abstract
During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that caused the coronavirus pandemic it is important now more than
ever that scientists and public health officials work side-by-side and use their available resources to track
patient information from those that have been affected by the novel coronavirus. The ability to track the
disease helps identify possible trends and patterns that can be used by public health officials to make
more informed decisions. Tracking data like this may be the key to helping states and countries safely reopen. However, when analyzing large collections of data there is the occurrence of confounding factors
such as biases in patient sampling. In this project, a massive collection of COVID-19 data was analyzed,
and explored potential biases in patient sampling were explored.

1. Introduction
In early 2020, the novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, caused a global pandemic [1]. Due to
this, many countries have put their residents under strict public health restrictions and stay-at-home
orders. The fast spread of the virus has forced businesses, schools, office buildings and many other public
places to shut down and move to remote-work locations. The fast-paced spread of COVID-19 is caused
by basic human interactions such as shaking hands and indirectly through objects that have been used or
touched by those infected [2]. With this ongoing spread it is important that public health officials have the
full visualization of the infection rates, and know the locations where infections continue to rise.

To be able to create visualizations, certain data from the patients being diagnosed with COVID-19 needed
to be collected and uploaded by scientists around the world.

The GISAID Initiative was created to enable the faster sharing of data from diseases and viruses such as
the novel coronavirus [3]. This initiative proved to be very useful to this research study because of the
amount of information that medical facilities around the world were willing to share to this database. The

records maintained in the GISAID Database offer biological information about the specimen collected
and demographic information about the patient from which the specimen was collected. Databases that
encourage data sharing are important because they help researchers from all around the world better
understand a global pandemic, and how diseases and viruses are spreading and evolving [3].

The key reason for this study is to observe possible sampling errors that may occur with the collection of
data. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers need to make inferences from data collected from
patients. However, for these inferences to be generalizable, researchers need to account for potential
confounding factors, such as biases in the patient sampling. In this project, we analyzed a massive
collection of COVID-19 data, and we explored potential biases in patient sampling.

2. Methods
Patient records were extracted from the GISAID database to form a collection of data on COVID-19
patient records. The process of data collection was performed to be able to identify all of the patient

information that has been collected. Python was used to read the collection of data. This data was then
analyzed and visualized using the seaborn and matplotlib Python libraries.

2.1 Obtaining the collection of data
Data was extracted from the GISAID database. The extracted data was stored in a gzipped JSON file as a
dataset of over 75,000 patient specimen records.

2.2 Reading the collection of data
Python was used to load the contents of the gzipped file and create a dictionary to hold the patient
records.

Each patient record stores an identifier, demographic information about the patient, biological information
about the specimen sample that was collected, information about the lab that collected the specimen, and
information about the lab that submitted the data to the GISAID database. This study focused on the
following attributes:

Key attributes for this study

COVID-19 ANALYSIS | 6
While analyzing the data, it was discovered that not all patient records provided the same types of
attributes, and the data was not always formatted the same way for a given attribute. Furthermore, some
attribute data were not formatted in a way that would be usable in the visualization techniques that we
implemented. In general, there were three types of “bad data” that we encountered:

Types of bad data
Number

Type

Description

1

missing

Data for the attribute of interest was not provided in the record.

2

unknown

Data for the attribute-of-interest was provided in the record, but was
entered as some variation of "unknown" or "not applicable".
Misspellings may occur.

3

invalid

Data for the attribute-of-interest was provided in the record, but
contained an error such as formatting inconsistencies or
misspellings.

Python scripts were written to read and display the data that was held in the records. Learning what
information was held in the records allowed the identification of data-entry errors that needed to be
corrected, and the discovery of information that could potentially uncover interesting trends. To capture
as much usable data as possible for analysis and visualization, scripts were written to correct the dataentry errors that were encountered throughout the records. Analyzing the information contained in the
dataset was essential for choosing what data to include in the visualizations.

2.3 Data Visualization
A variety of figures were generated to visualize trends in the data. Pie charts were generated using the
matplotlib Python library. [5] Graphs such as count plots, bar plots, and violin plots were generated using
the seaborn Python library. [6]

COVID-19 ANALYSIS | 7
For many of our charts and graphs, new datasets were created to hold the data required for the
visualizations. The type of visualization used to generate each figure was determined by the purpose of
the visualization and whether or not frequencies (or "counts") of a categorical attribute-of-interest were
calculated before generating the figure..

3. Results
3.1 Data Collection
At the time of this study, the GISAID database provided 75,571 entries of COVID-19 patient records
from around the world. These entries were submitted from countries all around the world, including
China, England, Itay, Jamaica, the United States, and many more. During the data collection process
many inconsistencies were noticed among the data set. These inconsistencies were due to the fact that the

database allows for manually-entered user input instead of automated input. Once inconsistencies like this
were fixed, the data collection process gave the study very good results to work with. With over 75,000
records from around the world, getting to see the different continents where the data came from is
important. The results below will show the number of records submitted by each continent. The results
show the age and gender are among the two highest attributes that were missing throughout the dataset.

3.2 Patient Demographics: Country
The following visualizations will show which countries around the world are sharing the most patient
records. By yielding data by country, results can be generated to show which gender has a higher
infection rate per country. Filtering out the results to only show the countries that have reported 1,000+
records to the database helped to narrow down the results to the countries that need to be focused on the
most.

3.2 Dates
One of the attributes that is collected by the database is “Collection date,” which is the day on which the
ch
patient's specimen sample is collected. Another attribute is “Submission Date,” which is the day on which
the data for the patient's specimen sample was submitted to GISAID. Both of these differ greatly from
one another, and that it is why it is important to be able to measure the time difference between them
both. The results will show how long various countries take to submit the patient data they have collected.

3.2.1 Collection Dates
As previously mentioned, the collection date indicates when the medical facility took the sample of the
COVID-19 patient. This is different from the submission date, which indicated when the facility
submitted the data to the GISAID Initiative. So results will show the time between submissions was as
long as two months at a time. These bar plots below show when COVID-19 specimen samples were
collected in China, the United States, England, and Australia.

3.2.2 Number of days between collection of samples and submission of data
In this study the comparison between the submission date against the collection date was done in order to
have a better idea of the time elapsed between those dates. The results will show how some countries took
longer than others to submit their results to the GISAID Database.

The violin plot shows how quickly data was submitted from China, the United States, England, and
Australia. There is a clear comparison between which countries submit their data quicker than other
countries. It is important that medical facilities share COVID-19 data as quickly as possible to help public
health officials make informed decisions.

During the data collection process it was noted that for over 60% of the data it was not specified whether
the sample was taken from a male or female human. However the rest of the data did have a male or
female input. Using this data, plots were made to show the rate of male, female, and unknown gender
patients with COVID -19 in different countries.

4. Discussion
4.1 Reflections for each chart and graph
The beginning figures provide information about which continents have submitted the most patient
records, which were: Europe, North America, and Asia. It is important to keep in mind that inferences can
an
be made about the number of COVID-19 patients in various locations, but the number of records
submitted may not necessarily reflect the actual number of people afflicted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in
those locations.

COVID-19 ANALYSIS | 25

Further into the results section there were plots that provide information about the data for patient gender,
and the patient age that was found in the dataset. When the gender and the age attribute was taken
throughout the dataset, the unknown amount is significantly higher than the amount of data that was
properly submitted. Due to this bad data, almost 70% of the records in the dataset were excluded when
analyzing patient gender and patient age. Due to this high percentage of unknown data a bar plot was
provided to inform about how often bad data was encountered in this study. The results showed gender
and patient age were two of the highest records in the dataset that had missing, unknown, or invalid data.
Also, note that one record may be missing multiple attributes at a time.

Also in the results section many plots provide information about data-submitting practices and COVID-19
rates in various countries. In the time range specified in figure 6, ten countries have submitted over 1,000
patient records. The result showed that England, USA, Wales, Scotland, and Australia have submitted the
most patient records. With so many records a plot was provided to identify information about when the
specimen samples were collected in various countries. Results showed the country of China collected the
majority of their samples in the earlier months of the year 2020. The results also suggest that China had
an earlier pandemic than the rest of the countries. China has the highest rate of “before 2020” collection.
Inference can be made that most of the collections made in the United States, England and Australia were
done during the early months of spring and all throughout the summer. The plot also shows that the
United States started collecting samples later than China. These plots show that all three countries had a
soaring amount of collections during the same months. This suggests that the United States, England, and
Australia experienced the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic at the same time.

Plots were also made to provide information about how much time has passed between sample collection
and data submission in various countries. China generally took between 50 and 100 days (2-3 months) to
submit COVID-19 patient data after taking a specimen sample, which is slower than what was observed

in the USA (0-2 months), England (0-2 months), and Australia (0-2 months). Among these four countries,
Australia is shown to be likely to submit patient data within 1 month of taking a specimen sample.

The violin plots that were made provide information about the gender data provided by the patient records
in China, the USA, England, and Australia. In each of these four countries, the number of patient data
increases from female to male to unknown. That is, the number of male patient data is higher than the
number of female patient data, and the number of patient data of unknown gender is higher than the
numbers of patient data for both females and males. In China and Australia, the number of unknowngender patients is higher but relatively similar to the numbers of female and male gender patients in the
respective countries. In the USA and England, the number of unknown-gender patients is much higher
than the numbers of female and male gender patients in those countries.

Additionally violin plots were also used to provide information about patient ages in various countries.
China, the USA, and Australia have a median age of over 40 years old. England shows a higher median
age: around 60 years old.In a different plot the results show that in China and Australia, the distributions
for male and female patient ages are even. In the USA, there is a heavier distribution of male patients
above 50 years old. In England, there is a heavier distribution of females under 40 years old.

4.2 The impact of bad data
Missing, unknown, and invalid data ("bad data") resulted in smaller sample sizes, which could limit the
generalizability of inferences made from data analysis. As discussed in Section 4.1, almost 70% of patient
records had bad data for gender and age.

Other than the issues with gender and age data discussed in Section 4.1, location data was also difficult to
read and to accurately discern usable data. Regarding the location data provided in the records, the

formatting was inconsistent, and it is also common to encounter inconsistent naming conventions, and
even typos.

To prevent the inclusion of bad data when performing analyses, bad data had to be handled on a case-bycase basis. Error-detection methods were implemented throughout the study. When data for an attributeof-interest was missing in a record, that record had to be excluded from the analysis. When formatting or
spelling errors were encountered, either data-exclusion or data-correction was performed, depending on
whether or not the correction could be confidently-assumed from the bad data.

4.3 Possible improvements for data entry practices
If a dataset is not cleanly-structured, the computational analysis process is adversely affected. Some
potential improvements to data entry practices are improving manual data entry and using automated data
capture instead of manual data entry. If manual data entry is used, the process can be improved by the use
of dropdown menus (rather than free text) and data validation to ensure that all information is formatted
correctly. If automated data capture (such as reading data directly from a file) is used instead of manual
data entry, the precision and correctness of the data would be greatly improved, along with increasing the
efficiency of the data entry process.

Although error-detection and error-correction methods were used during this study, there are risks
involved with handling data this way. There is a high chance that errors may go undetected and will not
be excluded in the dataset, which would cause bad data to be included in the analysis. If data is excluded,
the sample size to make inferences from is smaller. Data-correction is preferred over data-exclusion, if
possible, but is still not risk-free. If error-correction is used, there is risk involved with choosing to
assume what the corrected value of the data is.

Along with the risks involved, there were also impacts on the implementation of the code used in this
study. As new errors were discovered throughout the study, new code was written to handle those errors.
Many errors were handled using very specific code rather than being generalizable. For example, specific
code was written to handle individual abbreviations, misspellings, and other alternative naming
conventions. One tool that helped improve the efficiency of reading and filtering the data was a
predefined list of countries. The data-handling process could potentially be further improved by utilizing
predefined lists, such as lists of all cities in a country.
