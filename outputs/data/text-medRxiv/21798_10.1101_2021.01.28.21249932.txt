Summary
Background
Despite the direct viral activity, the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
includes an overproduction of cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6). Therefore tocilizumab
(TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors, became considered as a possible
therapeutic option.
Methods
Patients were selected from the SARSTer national database, which included 2332 individuals
with COVID-19 and the current study included 825 adult patients with moderate to severe
course. The retrospective analysis was performed in 170 patients treated with TCZ and 655
without this medication or any other anti-cytokine therapy. The end-points of treatment
effectiveness were a rate of death, need for mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement.
Results
Patients treated with TCZ were balanced compared to non-TCZ regarding gender, age, BMI,
and prevalence of coexisting conditions. The reduced death rate was demonstrated in patients
treated with TCZ and baseline IL-6 >100 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.27, 95% confidence
interval [CI]:0.10-0.78), or those needing oxygen supplementations who worsened within 7
days of hospitalization (HR: 0.38, 95% CI:0.16-0.88). The best effectiveness of TCZ was
achieved in patients with a combination of baseline IL-6>100 pg/ml and either SpO2≤90%
(HR for death, mechanical ventilation, and clinical improvement after 21 or 28 days: 0.07,
0.14, 5.53, 5.18 respectively) or requiring oxygen supplementation (HR for death and clinical
improvement after 21 or 28 days, 0.18, 2.66, 2.85 respectively).
Conclusions
Tocilizumab administered for COVID-19 in patients with a baseline concentration of IL6>100 pg/ml is associated with reduced mortality and faster clinical improvement,
particularly if there is a need for oxygen supplementation due to SpO2≤90%.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) was identified in December of 2019 and found to be responsible for an outbreak of
respiratory tract infections discovered in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of the disease known as
a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was announced as a global pandemic by the World
Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The search for effective therapy focused on
repurposing of approved drugs with confirmed activity against other viruses, that included, for
example, remdesivir (RDV), which was previously studied for the treatment of Ebola virus
disease as well as SARS-CoV-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses
[1, 2]. Based on findings from phase III clinical trials and real-world experience study RDV
received both American and European authorization [3, 4, 5]. Recommendations were also
given to lowmolecularweight heparin and dexamethasone [6, 7].

However, the

pathogenesis of COVID-19 is complicated and includes in addition to direct viral effect and
coagulopathy, an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines termed a cytokine storm,
which is responsible for organ damage and is considered a major reason for death due to
COVID-19 [8]. Unfortunately, standard anti-inflammatory treatments appear to be insufficient
for controlling the cytokine storm. Concentrations of several proinflammatory cytokines,
including interleukin (IL)-6, are substantially increased in patients with severe COVID-19 [9].
Higher concentrations of IL-6 was shown to be associated with faster progression of the
disease and worse prognosis. Therefore, tocilizumab (TCZ), an inhibitor of the IL-6 receptors
became considered as a possible therapeutic option [9, 10, 11]. Data from several studies have
been contradictory mostly to difficulties in the selection of optimal population and finding the
proper stage of the disease for administration [12, 13, 14]. Although the most recent
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by Stone et al. was not able to confirm the
effectiveness of TCZ, authors did not exclude the possible benefit from interleukin-6 receptor

5

blockade in some patient populations, because of wide confidence intervals for efficacy
comparisons [14].
The purpose of the study is to search for the population of patients with severe
COVID-19, which could obtain maximal benefit from the administration of tocilizumab, and
identify the predictors of response to the treatment with this drug.
Patients and Methods
Patients were selected from the SARSTer national database, which included 2332
patients treated between 1 March and 31 October 2020 in 30 Polish centers. This ongoing
project, supported by the Polish Association of Epidemiologists and Infectiologists, is a
national real-world experience study assessing treatment in patients with COVID-19. The
decision about the treatment regimen was taken entirely by the treating physician concerning
current knowledge and recommendations of the Polish Association of Epidemiologists and
Infectiologists [15, 16, 17]. The SARSTer study was approved by the Ethical Committee of
the Medical University of Białystok. If necessary the local bioethics committees approved
experimental use of drugs in patients with COVID-19. The current study included 825 adult
patients with moderate to severe course of the disease. Patients aged below 18 years, those
with oxygen saturation >95%, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at baseline
were excluded.
The retrospective analysis was carried out in 170 patients treated with tocilizumab
(RoActemra, Roche Pharma AG) and 655 patients which did not receive this medication as
well as any other monoclonal antibody directed against cytokine receptors. Tocilizumab was
administered intravenously at 8 mg/kg (maximum dose: 800 mg) in a single dose (1hour
infusion). If no improvement was observed, the second dose was considered after 8 to 12
hours (administered in 42% patients) according to the national recommendations [15, 16, 17].
6

Data were entered retrospectively and submitted online by a web-based platform operated by
Tiba sp. z o.o. Parameters collected at baseline included age, gender, body mass index (BMI),
coexisting conditions, other medication-related to COVID-19, clinical status at admission, and
adverse events. Baseline clinical status at hospital admission was classified according to
oxygen saturation (SpO2) 91-95%, or SpO2 ≤90% as well as based on the score on an ordinal
scale.
The end-points of treatment effectiveness were a rate of death, need for mechanical
ventilation, and clinical improvement in the ordinal scale based on WHO recommendations
modified to fit the specificity of the national health care system. Clinical improvement was
defined as at least a 2-point decrease from baseline to 14, 21, and 28 days of hospitalization.
The ordinal scale was scored as follows: 1. unhospitalized, no activity restrictions; 2.
unhospitalized, no activity restrictions and/or requiring oxygen supplementation at home; 3.
hospitalized, does not require oxygen supplementation and does not require medical care; 4.
hospitalized, requiring no oxygen supplementation, but requiring medical care; 5.
hospitalized, requiring normal oxygen supplementation; 6. hospitalized, on non-invasive
ventilation with high-flow oxygen equipment; 7. hospitalized, for invasive mechanical
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 8. death.
To identify possible predictors of response to the treatment with TCZ we compared
rates of achieved end-points in patients receiving versus not receiving TCZ. Following
baseline, predictors were included: age above 70 years, the need for oxygen high flow
(ordinal scale 6 points) at baseline, clinical worsening during 7 days of hospitalization in
patients with regular oxygen supplementation at baseline (5 points in original scale),
SpO2<90% at baseline and several laboratory measures at baseline, such as IL-6>100 pg/ml,
C-reactive protein (CRP)>200 mg/l, neutrophils >7500 /μl, lymphocytes >1200 /μl, D-dimer
>1000 μg/l, and procalcitonin >0.1 ng/ml.

Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or n (%) and odds ratios
with 95% confidence intervals. P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant. The significance of difference was calculated by Fisher's exact test for nominal
variables and by Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA for continuous variables.
Survival analyses were performed by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test and depicted as KaplanMeier plots. Univariable comparisons were calculated by GraphPad Prism 5.1 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).
Results
Among 825 patients included in the study 170 received therapy with TCZ and 655 did
not receive TCZ. As shown in Table 1 groups were balanced regarding gender, age, and BMI,
but there was a predominance of males in both arms. Patients treated with TCZ more
frequently demonstrated a course of the disease with SpO2≤90% at admission to the hospital
(65.9%) compared to those without TCZ (37.7%). Moreover, patients treated with TCZ more
often required normal or high flow oxygen supplementation (93.6%) compared to the nonTCZ group (76.8%). The prevalence of coexisting conditions was similar in both groups, but
patients treated with TCZ more frequently received other medication-related to COVID-19
(Table 1).
As shown in Table 2 the rate of clinical improvement after 21 and 28 days was
significantly higher in patients which did not receive TCZ. However, a statistically significant
decrease in death rate was demonstrated in patients treated with TCZ and baseline IL-6
exceeding 100 pg/ml or those needing oxygen supplementation at baseline who worsened
within the initial 7 days of hospitalization (Table 2, Figure 1). As shown with the KaplanMeier analysis there were no significant differences between TCZ and non-TCZ arms when
8

the analysis was carried out in all patients or those with baseline IL-6 concentration below
100 pg/ml. Further analysis included the correlation between IL-6 concentration and several
possible clinical and laboratory indices associated with the course of the disease. Among
patients with baseline SpO2≤90%, which are potential TCZ recipients significant correlation
was demonstrated between serum concentrations of IL-6 and SpO2, levels of C-reactive
protein, procalcitonin D-dimers, as well as white blood cell and neutrophil counts (Table 3).
We also analyzed a combination of several measures. As shown in table 4, the best
effectiveness of TCZ administration can be achieved in patients with serum IL-6>100 pg/ml
and either SpO2≤90% or requiring normal or high-flow oxygen supplementation. Statistically,
significant effectiveness was achieved regarding the risk of death, the need for mechanical
ventilation, as well as clinical improvement after 21 and 28 days (Table 4). Significantly
better survival among such patients treated with TCZ was also demonstrated with a KaplanMeier analysis (Figure 2).
Adverse events related to therapy were infrequent and reported in 22% of patients
treated with TCZ. The most frequent was an elevation of aminotransferases activities (10%),
which was usually associated with remdesivir. Less frequent were diarrhea (5%) - mostly in
patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir, and prolonged QT interval (3%) related to chloroquine.
Discussion
Uncontrolled immune activation with high-level release of various pro-inflammatory
cytokines is a hallmark of the lung, but also multiorgan damage, during later phases of
COVID-19. It is usually termed as a "cytokine storm" and observed mainly during the second
and third week of symptomatic disease in patients with severely impaired oxygen saturation
[18]. Unsurprisingly, anti-cytokine agents including anti-IL-1R and anti-IL6R antagonists
were among important candidates in the therapy of later stages of COVID-19. One of the
9

rationales was a good suppressive effect of tocilizumab in cytokine release syndrome during
CAR T-cells therapy [19]. Regardless of the pathophysiological link various randomized and
observational studies of TCZ, while suggesting some benefit, did not bring clear evidence
supporting its use in COVID-19. This may reflect the unique features of individual immune
responses to pathogens, as well as the necessity of a complex and personalized approach in
prescribing and timing immunomodulatory treatment. Proposing clinical trial protocol taking
such diversity into account proves to be challenging thus personalized medicine relies on
observational research and real-life experiences.
Results of our real-world evidence study could potentially explain the lack of
effectiveness of TCZ observed in other studies, but also provide information on the optimal
use of this agent. In our cohort, similarly to the first two randomized controlled trials (RCT),
TCZ did not decrease overall mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In the first by
Stone JH et al. [14], 83% of 243 COVID-19 subjects requiring oxygen supplementation but
not mechanical ventilation, were randomized to TCZ (8mg/kg, single dose) or placebo. In this
study, the odd ratio (HR) for death was 0.83, which was not significant, but with broad 95%
confidence intervals (0.38 to 1.81, P=0.64) suggesting heterogeneity of probable association
depending on other clinical variables not found in the publication. In another RCT by
Hermine et al [12] including 131 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen
supplementation but not mechanically ventilated, 64 were randomized to TCZ (8 mg/kg,
twice) or placebo. Likewise, the adjusted HR for 28-day mortality was 0.92 (90%CI 0.332.53). On the other hand, on day 14 in TCZ-group, 12% fewer patients needed non-invasive
or mechanical ventilation, or 12% less died (HR 0.58; 90%CI 0.33-1.00). Only the most
recent and largest RCT by Salama et al [13] showed a higher survival rate in patients treated
with TCZ. In this study, 377 subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia, 64% requiring low-flow
and 26% on non-invasive and high flow oxygen supplementation, were randomized to TCZ
10

(n=259, 8mg/kg, one or two doses) or placebo. By day 28 HR for mechanical ventilation or
death was 0.56 (95%CI: 0.33-0.97, P=0.04), while still the number of patients who died by
that day of any reason was 10.4% in TCZ-group vs 8.6% in the placebo group.
Summarizing, all aforementioned randomized clinical trials despite a rather
homogenous population included, which is patients with COVID-19 pneumonia mainly
requiring oxygen supplementation but not ventilated, it was not possible to visualize the
obvious survival benefit of TCZ. Similarly in our study, the overall mortality was comparable
between TCZ and non-TCZ patients (odds ratio, OR 1.05; 95%CI: 0.61-1.80). Furthermore,
the group receiving TCZ showed even lesser odds of clinical improvement after 14 and 21
days of therapy (OR 0.61 and 0.64, respectively), while it was comparable to the standard of
care therapy at the end of observation, ie. after 28 days (OR 0.87). On the other hand, only
analyses in specific subgroups showed not only a higher survival rate but also more rapid
clinical improvement in patients treated with TCZ. It was quite striking that in previous
studies mortality HR had quite outsized confidence intervals, suggesting another factor
playing the predictive role of TCZ efficacy. Surprisingly enough, cited above RCT did not
evaluate baseline IL-6 serum concentration even since TCZ is aimed at blocking an IL-6
proinflammatory pathway. Indeed, we performed a detailed subgroup analysis aiming at the
development of predictors of TCZ-response in COVID-19 subjects. Not unpredictably, the
best response to TCZ concerning decreasing 28-day mortality (OR=0.27; 95%CI: 0.10-0.78,
11% vs 31%, P=0.02) was observed in subjects with baseline serum IL-6>100 pg/mL, while it
was not observed in subject with baseline IL-6 50-100 pg/mL and below 50 pg/mL.
Importantly, an IL-6 level of more than 100pg/mL was observed in appr. 18% of all studied
patients, possibly explain why the difference was not noted in overall studied groups in the
aforementioned RCT but also our study. This observation also underlines the pathogenetic
complexity of cytokine imbalance during COVID-19. It is known that cytokine storm in
11

COVID-19 consists of various, not necessarily overlapping, soluble immune mediators
(SIMs) including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) which could yield
different predictive value [20]. Interestingly, Mathew et al [21] in their elegant study shown at
least three different immunotypes of COVID-19, 1-3 depending on the cluster of
differentiation (CD)4+ cell, CD8+ cell, B-cell, and plasmablasts activation/exhaustion, which
was associated with different outcomes but also most likely with different levels of cytokines.
Interestingly, despite baseline IL-6 in our study TCZ administration was not associated with
baseline CRP, D-dimer, or lymphocyte concentrations, which are also regarded as factors
associated with prognosis [22].
Another important finding of our study was that the highest reduction in mortality, the
need for mechanical ventilation, and best clinical improvement at day 28 in patients receiving
TCZ vs standard of care (SOC)-therapy was observed in patients with baseline IL6>100ng/mL and Sp02<90% (11 vs 50%, 5 vs 29%, 75 vs 37% respectively), which was not
the case in subjects with Sp02≥90%. This observation might further underline that in subjects
with severe hypoxia further deregulation between IL-6 levels and other cytokines is present
and possibly IL-6 activation is deeper and not counterbalanced by regulatory mechanism,
which could explain why the effectiveness of TCZ is more significant. Also in our study
correlation analyses showed the correlation pattern of IL-6 and some soluble immune
mediators are different in patients with oxygen saturation lower and higher/equal to 90%.
The results of our study should be taken with some caution since its retrospective realworld evidence design and in some subgroup analyses, the number of participants is small.
Moreover, some patients in both arms received additional medication, which could affect the
outcome of the disease. On the other hand, patients receiving TCZ and non-TCZ SOC
therapies seem to be well balanced with regard to comorbidities and co-medications for
COVID-19, and undoubtedly its advantage is the assessment of baseline serum IL-6
12

concentration. Indeed, while only one another single-center study showed a beneficial effect
of TCZ mainly in patients with higher IL-6 [23], our data in a real-world large dataset seems
to guide the effective use of TCZ in COVID-19.
In conclusion, the possible benefit from the treatment of COVID-19 with tocilizumab
can be achieved in selected subpopulations only. This regimen can be associated with reduced
mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with a baseline concentration of
interleukin 6 exceeding 100 pg/ml, particularly if they need oxygen supplementation due to
oxygen saturation of ≤90%. Patients who worsened within the initial 7 days of hospitalization
can also obtain some benefits from tocilizumab administration, but it should be clarified in
further studies on a bigger number of patients.
