ABSTRACT (

Background:

A new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01, was identified in the UK in

December-2020. Direct estimates of its potential to enhance transmission are limited.
Methods:

Nose and throat swabs from 28-September-2020 to 2-January-2021 in the UK’s nationally

representative surveillance study were tested by RT-PCR for three genes (N, S and ORF1ab). Those
positive only on ORF1ab+N, S-gene target failures (SGTF), are compatible with
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. We investigated cycle threshold (Ct) values (a proxy for viral load),
percentage of positives, population positivity and growth rates in SGTF vs non-SGTF positives.
Results:

15,166(0.98%) of 1,553,687 swabs were PCR-positive, 8,545(56%) with three genes detected

and 3,531(23%) SGTF. SGTF comprised an increasing, and triple-gene positives a decreasing,
percentage of infections from late-November in most UK regions/countries, e.g. from 15% to 38% to
81% over 1.5 months in London. SGTF Ct values correspondingly declined substantially to similar
levels to triple-gene positives. Population-level SGTF positivity remained low (<0.25%) in all
regions/countries until late-November, when marked increases with and without self-reported
symptoms occurred in southern England (to 1.5-3%), despite stable rates of non-SGTF cases. SGTF
positivity rates increased on average 6% more rapidly than rates of non-SGTF positives (95% CI 4-9%)
supporting addition rather than replacement with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. Excess growth rates for
SGTF vs non-SGTF positives were similar in those up to high school age (5% (1-8%)) and older
individuals (6% (4-9%)).
Conclusions:

Direct population-representative estimates show that the B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 SARS-

CoV-2 variant leads to higher infection rates, but does not seem particularly adapted to any age
group.

INTRODUCTION

After initial reductions in SARS-CoV-2 cases, infection rates have increased in many countries
following release of large-scale lockdowns1. There are likely multiple reasons, including variable
adherence to different levels of restrictions. However, the potential contribution of genetic
adaptation has been highlighted by the discovery of a new genetic variant in southern England,
B.1.1.7/VOC(variant of concern)202012/012, followed by rapid increases in cases. Amongst unusually
large numbers of genetic changes supporting this lineage, particularly in the spike (S) protein, three
have potentially important effects. N501Y in the receptor binding domain increases binding affinity
to the ACE2 receptor3,4, H69del/V70del may be associated with immune response evasion, and
P681H, adjacent to the furin cleavage site5, may facilitate entry into epithelial cells. H69del/V70del
also affects PCR assays targeting the S-gene, preventing probe binding and causing S-gene target
failure (SGTF).

To date, data on the transmissibility and severity of B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 have come from two
mathematical modelling studies (using hospital admissions/occupancy, deaths, prevalence [from
symptomatic community testing] and seroprevalence, and percentages of sequenced positives
accounted for by B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 in southern England)6,7, and analyses of the UK’s
symptomatic community testing programme7-9 and whole genome sequences from this
programme7,9. Estimates suggest 56%6 (95% credible interval 50-74%) and 40-80%7 greater
transmissibility associated with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. Analyses of community testing are limited by
non-random sampling of symptomatic individuals, and there being only three laboratories in the UK’s
national testing programme which can identify SGTFs10, meaning only ~35% tests can be
categorised,7 distributed unequally nationally. However, at present SGTF is highly sensitive (99.3%)
and specific (99.5%) for H69del/V70del8, with the percentage of H69del/V70del that were

B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 increasing from 3% mid-October to 64% early-November and 98% earlyDecember11. A matched case-control study of 3,538 fully sequenced B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 and wildtype cases found no evidence of differences in hospitalisation (0.9% vs 1.5%, respectively) or 28-day
mortality (0.9% vs 0.7%, respectively)8. However, secondary attack rates were raised in contacts of
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 (14.7%) or SGTF (14.9%) versus wild-type (11%)11.

Here we use the UK’s national COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS), a representative sample of
households with longitudinal follow-up12, in which SGTF is consistently identified, to directly
investigate whether the new variant is associated with higher infection rates, overall or particularly in
children, given that schools generally remained open despite other lockdown precautions during the
study period.

METHODS

This analysis included all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests of nose and throat swabs from 28-September2020 to 2-January-2021 in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) CIS (ISRCTN21086382,
https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey/protocol-and-information-sheets).
The survey randomly selects private households on a continuous basis from address lists and
previous surveys to provide a representative UK sample. Following verbal agreement to participate, a
study worker visited each household to take written informed consent, which was obtained from
parents/carers for those 2-15 years; those aged 10-15 years provided written assent. Those <2 years
were not eligible.

Individuals were asked about demographics, symptoms, contacts and relevant behaviours
(https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey/case-record-forms). To reduce
transmission risks, participants ≥12 years self-collected nose and throat swabs following study
worker instructions. Parents/carers took swabs from children <12 years. At the first visit, participants
were asked for (optional) consent for follow-up visits every week for the next month, then monthly
for 12 months from enrolment. The study received ethical approval from the South Central Berkshire
B Research Ethics Committee (20/SC/0195).

Swabs were analysed at the UK’s national Lighthouse Laboratories at Milton Keynes and Glasgow
using identical methodology. RT-PCR for three SARS-CoV-2 genes (N protein, S protein and ORF1ab)
used the Thermo Fisher TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, and analysed using UgenTec FastFinder
3.300.5, with an assay-specific algorithm and decision mechanism that allows conversion of
amplification assay raw data from the ABI 7500 Fast into test results with minimal manual
intervention. Samples are called positive if at least a single N-gene and/or ORF1ab are detected
(although S-gene cycle threshold (Ct) values are determined, S-gene detection alone is not
considered sufficient to call a sample positive). We estimated a single Ct value as the arithmetic

mean of Ct values for genes detected (Spearman correlation >0.98 between each pair of Ct values).
Viral loads were estimated from a linearity curve (in13, Supplementary Figure 1).

The presence of 12 specific symptoms in the previous seven days was elicited at each visit (cough,
fever, myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, abdominal pain,
diarrhoea, loss of taste, loss of smell), as was whether participants thought they had (unspecified)
symptoms compatible with COVID-19. Any positive response to any symptom question at the swabpositive visit defined the case as symptomatic at the test.

We investigated Ct values using median (quantile) regression, positivity rates at the regional level
using multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP), and growth rates using iterative sequential
Poisson regression (ISR)14,15 (details in Supplementary Methods). Cases positive only on a single gene
consistently have high Ct values reflecting variable target detection at low viral loads13. Therefore, we
considered only samples positive for ORF1ab+N-gene and negative for S-gene as SGTF, not those
positive for the N-gene or ORF1ab alone. Sensitivity analyses included only positives with Ct<30, to
assess the impact of non-SGTF cases being more likely to be sampled late in their infection, and
hence have higher Ct values16.

RESULTS

From 28-September-2020 to 2-January-2021, 372,626 participants from 185,342 households across
the United Kingdom had results from median 4 (IQR 3-5, range 1-12) nose and throat swabs each. Of
1,553,687 test results, 15,166 (0.98%, 95% CI 0.96-0.99%) were positive, in 11,800 individuals from
8,868 households. 8,545(56%) were positive on all three genes, 3,531(23%) only on ORF1ab+N, i.e.
were SGTF compatible with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01, and 3,090(20%) were other single/double
positives.

SGTF comprised an increasing, and triple-gene positives a decreasing, percentage of positives from
late-November in most regions/countries, consistent with SGTF representing nonB.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 H69del/V70del strains, or positives with lower viral load, before this (Figure
,

). The timing of rises in SGTF-positives varied strongly across

region/country; e.g., rising from 15% early-November to 38% end-November and 81% end-December
in London, versus 7%, 13% and 45% respectively in the West Midlands. Results were similar
restricting to positives with Ct<30, which may be more likely to be new infections (Supplementary
). In parallel, Ct values in SGTF showed a major shift, being consistently high (~30, ~150

Figure 2

copies/ml) through to mid-November, before dropping sharply to a minimum ~20 (~230,000
copies/ml) at different times depending on region/country (Figure 1B), likely reflecting expansion of
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 amongst SGTF positives8. In contrast, Ct values varied much less in triple-gene
positives, remaining ~22-27 (Figure 1D), with small increases and decreases consistent with trends in
overall positivity13,16. By January 2021, median Ct values were similar in SGTF and triple-gene
positives in most regions/countries, suggesting that earlier differences were due to more SGTF being
new infections rather than intrinsic biological differences affecting viral loads.

At a population level, the percentage of individuals with SGTF vs non-SGTF positives in different
regions/countries varied substantially over time (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 3). Marked

increases in SGTF positivity rates occurred in London, the South East and East of England from lateNovember despite rates of non-SGTF positives remaining stable, suggesting trends were not due to
changing behaviour alone. In more northern English regions, increases in SGTF positivity started later,
from mid-December, generally on a background of stable rates of non-SGTF positives. SGTF positivity
remained relatively low in the South West, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, furthest from the
South East. Analyses considering household positivity were similar (Supplementary Figure 4).

Importantly, increases in SGTF positivity were similar in those with and without self-reported
symptoms (Figure 3). Trends over time in non-SGTF positivity were similar in those with and without
self-reported symptoms (Supplementary Figure 5), but rates were generally slightly higher in those
not reporting symptoms, potentially reflecting ongoing PCR-positivity after earlier acute infection.
Supporting this, rates of non-SGTF positivity with Ct<30 (i.e. more likely early infection) were much
more similar in those with and without self-reported symptoms (Supplementary Figure 6).

The relative dynamics of SGTF vs non-SGTF varied over time (Figure 2). The most marked increases in
growth rates for SGTF occurred at a median positivity rate of 0.25% (range 0.15-1%, Supplementary
). To assess whether B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 was replacing or adding to existing strains, we

compared growth rates of SGTF vs non-SGTF within the same region in the two most recent epochs
defined by changes in trend in either SGTF/non-SGTF identified by ISR (Figures 2&4A, Supplementary
). SGTF positivity rates increased more rapidly than non-SGTF

positivity rates in most regions in most epochs (points to the right of the gray line in Figure 4A), but
particularly strongly in the preceding epoch in southern regions and the most recent epoch in
East/West Midlands, the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber (doubling times all under 10
days, Supplementary Table 1). Further, the rate of growth in SGTF positives generally exceeded the
decline in non-SGTF positives (points above the black line), by an average of 6% (95% CI 4-9%) (Figure
), supporting addition rather than replacement with the B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. In January 2021,

SGTF growth rates were stabilising in the regions with the highest absolute rates, but increasingly
markedly in regions with intermediate rates such as the Midlands and North West (Supplementary
). Sensitivity analyses restricting to “new infections” with Ct<30 were similar

Figure 9A

(Supplementary Figure 10).

The relative difference in growth rates of SGTF vs non-SGTF had a similar distribution in those up to
high-school age (i.e. ≤15/16 years, 5% excess (95% CI 1-8%)) versus older (6% (4-9%))
(Supplementary Figure 11, Supplementary Table 2), with no evidence that SGTF positivity rates were
consistently growing faster or slower in those under and over high school age (Figure 5A; similarly for
non-SGTF positives, Supplementary Figure 12A). Consistent with this, there was no evidence of
variation by age group in the percentage of positives that were SGTF vs non-SGTF between 21December-2020 and 2-January-2021 for any region/country (p>0.05, Supplementary Figure 13,
). However, because positivity was generally highest in those up to high

Supplementary Table 3

school age (Supplementary Figure 14), a greater number of infections would be expected to arise in
younger individuals from the same growth rate as in older individuals.

Lastly, we estimated the ratio of SGTF positivity rates by age (Supplementary Figure 15A) to nonSGTF positivity rates by age (Supplementary Figure 15B) in the nine English regions with sufficient
cases to model age as a continuous factor. Although increases in SGTF positives relative to non-SGTF
positives generally occurred earliest in younger individuals, this was not uniform across regions and
did not occur consistently in school-age children first (Figure 5B).

DISCUSSION

In this large representative community surveillance study, we found clear evidence of increases in
SGTF SARS-CoV-2, consistent with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 expansion, in multiple UK regions from
mid-to-late November, including during periods of national lockdown when non-SGTF strains were
stable or decreasing. Multiple lines of evidence support B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 leading to higher
infection rates in adults and children, and adding to, rather than simply replacing, existing strains.
However, we found no evidence that Ct values (a proxy for viral load) were intrinsically substantially
lower in SGTF-positives, in contrast to initial reports17,18, but consistent with observations that
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 infection is not more severe8. Importantly, rates of SGTF infections with and
without self-reported symptoms were similar, consistent with the higher prevalence of
asymptomatic infection reported in defined populations (30%19) and community surveillance (e.g.
42%20, 72%21). Asymptomatic infections may therefore be contributing substantially to
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 spread, and are not currently captured by the national testing programme,
which focusses on symptomatic cases and their contacts.

Genetic drift means that new variants will continuously arise, and some will become the established
dominant viral population simply due to chance founder effects. Here we directly compared growth
rates for SGTF vs non-SGTF strains within epochs within regions (i.e. matched) to attempt to control
for variation in behaviour and other confounders which undoubtedly affect transmission. SGTF
consistently had greater growth rates, supporting increased transmissibility, since it is unlikely that
chance founder effects would have the same influence in multiple regions/countries. Further, excess
SGTF growth rates generally outweighed declines in non-SGTF positives, showing
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 is likely adding to, rather than replacing, existing strains. This is particularly
concerning given recent reports of the recent expansion of SGTF in the US22, although this may
reflect different variants23. Our findings of no evidence of difference in SGTF growth rates between
children and adults do not support B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 being particularly adapted to transmit

more in children. However, the higher current positivity rates in children and young adults in the UK
inevitably means that the same growth rates will result in a higher number of new infections from
these age groups.

The marked increases in SGTF varied substantially in timing between regions. B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01
was first observed end-September2; our analyses are consistent with its presence at low but
increasing frequencies in southern regions from this time (Supplementary Figure 3). Increases
generally became marked once 0.25% SGTF positivity was exceeded (Figure 2); heterogeneity in
dispersion (“k”) and super-spreading events, particularly from those without symptoms but with low
Ct/high viral loads24, plus chance variation, could explain its persistence without inevitable growth
below this.

We found no evidence that increased infection rates associated with B.1.1.7/VOC202012/0 were
mediated through higher viral load (lower Ct). Direct comparisons are complicated by the fact that
average Ct values in surveillance studies depend on whether positivity rates are increasing or
decreasing16; however, current medians in SGTF are similar to those observed in triple-positives in
regions with high positivity rates (e.g. northern England in early October). Further, sensitivity
analyses restricting to positives with Ct<30, more likely to be new infections rather than ongoing
PCR-positivity, gave similar results. An alternative explanation for differential growth rates is that,
rather than greater transmissibility per se, B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 may be more likely to lead to
infection following any given exposure, consistent with enhanced ACE2 receptor binding associated
with the N501Y mutation3. This hypothesis requires further investigation; whilst ACE2 gene
expression increases with age25, effects could still be proportionate across the ages.

The main study strength is its design, being a large-scale community survey with a robust sampling
frame across all ages and including asymptomatic infections, providing direct population-level

estimates of positivity, in contrast to previous studies relying on routine symptomatic surveillance
and necessary additional assumptions about parameter estimates based on non-random samples
from other countries and time periods6-8. The main limitation is that not all SGTF will be
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01, even in the most recent period, as illustrated by varying Ct in SGTF by region
(Figure 1B). Rather, we model SGTF in their entirety to estimate a “background” rate on which we
can assess when B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 might have arisen, as indicated by evidence for a change in
trend using ISR. Enhanced whole genome sequencing for survey positives started mid-December, but
was previously sparse. Preliminary data support B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 comprising most SGTF in the
survey from mid-November, and >88% of SGTF in the national symptomatic testing program are
B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 from this time8. However, conversely, some “non-SGTF” single N-gene or
ORF1ab only positives (with high Ct13) could also be B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01. ISR does not identify
“optimal” changepoints, and therefore does not correspond exactly to MRP, but this would be
expected to lead to dilution bias. Analyses by participant do not account for within-household
clustering; however, results were similar in household-level analyses (Supplementary Figure 4). Our
analysis is based on regions, although there were some local differences in restrictions on hospitality
and socialising within regions. However, mathematical models including only changes in
behaviour/contact patterns poorly fitted observed data, suggesting this may have had less effect6.

In summary, direct representative population-level estimates of positivity across ages show that the
new B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 SARS-CoV-2 variant leads to higher infection rates overall, but is not
particularly adapted to any specific age group. Although similar to other strains, the high percentage
of infections without any evidence of symptoms, coupled with higher transmissibility, has made
control extremely challenging without widespread whole community measures e.g. national
lockdowns, school closures. Careful monitoring for ingress of B.1.1.7/VOC202012/01 through whole
genome sequencing should be a priority in other countries. Continued surveillance for sudden

(B) Difference in growth rates

Note: panel (A) shows growth rates (rate ratio (RR) per day) of SGTF (x-axis) and non-SGTF (y-axis)
positives within the same region in epochs defined by changepoints (change in trend) identified by
ISR and shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1. 95% CI are truncated at 0.8 and 1.2. RR>1
mean positivity rates are increasing, <1 that they are decreasing. Points to the right of the gray
diagonal line are periods of time where, within one region, SGTF positives are increasing faster than
non-SGTF positives; and points on/around the gray line where SGTF and non-positives are changing
at similar rates within a region. The black diagonal line indicates opposite growth rates, that is SGTF
are increasing at the same rate non-SGTF are decreasing or vice versa within a region, consistent with
replacement. Points above the black line are consistent with addition. Panel B shows difference
between growth rates in SGTF and non-SGTF from Figure 4A, combined using random effects metaanalysis.

(B) Ratio of SGTF:non-SGTF positivity by age and time

Note: for panel A, meta-analysis combining estimates shown in Supplementary Figure 12B, and
corresponding estimates for non-SGTF in Supplementary Figure 12A&C. SGTF and non-SGTF
positivity rates by age over time shown in Supplementary Figure 15.
