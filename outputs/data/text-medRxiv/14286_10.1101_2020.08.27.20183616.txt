What is already known on this topic
•

Most of Covid-19 confirmed patients in Vietnam were acquired overseas.

•

In Vietnam, Covid-19 epidemic had the low estimated reproduction ratio (R0) and
SARS-CoV-2 spread was on the downward trend before July 25.

What this study adds
•

Covid-19 confirmed patients were older in the time after lockdown end compared to in
the period before lockdown end by a median of 5 years.

•

All discharged Covid-19 patients and no Covid-19 death were in the phase before
lockdown, while post lockdown period had still remained significant patients being
under treatment, especially reported first fatalities.

•

Continuous volume of people returning Vietnam from abroad through two stages
during the Covid-19 epidemic.

•

Our analysis might be considered as a prompt reference source for further in-depth
surveys to understand the adaptive models of Covid-19 patients among different
provinces.

Abstract

1

Background. Given the Covid-19’ sudden rapid spread in the community since 25 July 2020, an

2

updated analysis of Covid-19 cases was conducted to examine the differences of characteristics

3

of Covid-19 patients before versus after partial lockdown end in Vietnam.

4

Methods. Data of 569 Covid-19 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 23 January to

5

31 July was collected from available official databases. We divided Covid-19 situation timeline

6

into two main periods, before lockdown end (23 January - 22 April) and after lockdown end (23

7

April - 31 July).

8

Results. We found significant variations in the distribution of Covid-19 patients among different

9

provinces between two periods. Covid-19 confirmed patients were older in the time after

10

lockdown end compared to in the period before lockdown end by a median of 5 years. All

11

discharged Covid-19 patients and no Covid-19 death were in the phase before lockdown, while

12

post lockdown period had still remained significant patients being under treatment, especially

13

reported first fatalities. The number of Covid-19 patients who returned from other countries

14

(excluding China) slightly increased through two stages (p >0.05), partially showing that the

15

continuous volume of people returning Vietnam from abroad during the Covid-19 epidemic.

16

Conclusions. Our analysis indicated demographic and epidemiological disparity of Covid-19

17

patients before versus after loosening the national partial lockdown in Vietnam. It is important to

18

suggest that, proactive efforts in Covid-19 control after partial lockdown end will be effective

19

when the measures to closely control and monitor repatriation and immigration via the borders of

20

Vietnam are strictly enforced.

Introduction

23

Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) crisis, the lockdown has been

24

considered a key policy response in many countries to prevent the further spread of the severe

25

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes the disease. The

26

implementation of the lockdown order, however, has varied in countries and territories around

27

the world, thanks to the unpredictable situation of the pandemic [1]. Vietnam is one of the few

28

countries achieving effective control of Covid-19 outbreak after the implementation of lockdown

29

strategy [2]. Under Directive No. 16/CT-TTg issued in March 31, 2020, a “stay-at-home” order

30

was imposed nationwide to curb the spread of the contagion, limit the number of infections and

31

casualties, and alleviate the pressure on the health service providers. The effectiveness of such

32

outbreak control was evidenced by the fact that there were only 59 new infected cases confirmed

33

during the first 14-day nationwide social distancing (from April 1 to 14, 2020), equaled to 40%

34

of the two weeks prior to the national lockdown [3]. Of these, there were 30 confirmed cases in

35

isolation zones and 29 confirmed cases in the community [3]. Within 99 days since April 15,

36

Vietnam had confirmed no community transmission despite extensive testing. While in many

37

regions of the world strict Covid-19 lockdown orders had still been in effect, the Government of

38

Vietnam relaxed social distancing rules for almost all provinces and cities on 23 April [4]. The

39

early success in Vietnam’ epidemic control has mainly attributed to the national emergency

40

response across the whole sociopolitical system, in particular, 22-day nationwide lockdown.

41

However, the strike of no Covid-19 community transmission has been broken on July 25 when a

42

new case were reported in Da Nang City [5]. This disruption made the Covid-19 pandemic in

43

Vietnam more unforeseeable than ever [6], [7], [8]. Immediately, contact tracing efforts as well

44

as epidemiologic investigations have been strengthened under the strong guidance of the

45

Vietnamese Prime Minister, yet the source of the infection is not known in several new cases [8],

[9]. With the estimation of the reproduction ratio (R0) for 257 first Covid-19 patients in Vietnam

47

(between 23/1/2020 and 10/4/2020), a Huy G. Nguyen’ early analysis revealed the downward

48

trend of the epidemic in this country [10]. However, the potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission in

49

the community is not reflective of current reality in each stage under Government’ strict

50

restrictions. An initial understanding of the characteristics of Covid-19 patients detected before

51

and after lockdown end in Vietnam is needed to suggest prompt and efficient actions in the

52

worst-case scenarios for in Vietnam. Given the Covid-19’ rapid spread, an updated analysis of

53

cases was conducted to examine the differences of characteristics of Covid-19 patients before

54

versus after lockdown end in Vietnam.

55

Methods

56

In this paper, we collected data of Covid-19 patients who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2

57

infection from 23 January to 31 July, 2020. We divided Covid-19 situation timeline from 23

58

January to 31 July 2020 into two main periods, before lockdown end (23 January – 22 April,

59

2020) and after lockdown end (23 April – 31 July, 2020). We selected cut-off point of Covid-19

60

situation timeline in Vietnam on 23 April, 2020 (23 April, 2020 is the day that the Vietnam

61

Government decided to loosen the national lockdown [4]).

62

Data sources

63

Analysis data in this paper was extracted from two sources, official database of the Ministry of

64

Health of Vietnam (MOH) (https://ncov.moh.gov.vn/) and the website of Our World in Data

65

(https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#coronavirus-country-profiles) [11]. A total of 569

66

Covid-19 confirmed patients were consecutively detected from 23 January to 31 July, 2020

67

(Figure 1).

Covid-19 positive case and Covid-19 suspected case were defined according to the Decision No.

70

322 / QD-BYT of February 6, 2020 of the Minister of Health for the period before lockdown end

71

[12] and according to the Decision 1344 / QD-BYT 2020 Guidance on diagnosis and treatment

72

of COVID-19 [13] for the period after lockdown. The Vietnam’ tests were reported by the WHO

73

and MOH approved laboratories [12], [13].

74

Covid-19 recovered case before and after lockdown end was defined that, a patient who

75

recovered from Covid-19 and discharged from the health facility met the following criteria: 1) no

76

fever for at least three days; 2) a good general health condition; (3) two samples taken at least 1

77

day apart having negative test results for SARS-CoV-2 [12], [13].

78

Covid-19 death case is a patient with confirmed Covid-19 infection whose death resulted from

79

clinically compatible illness, unless there is an other certain cause of mortality that cannot be

80

related to Covid-19 disease (e.g., trauma). No period of full recovery was recorded between the

81

illness and death.

82

Variables

83

The variables in this analysis were selected on the basis of the availability of above official

84

databases. The variables related to the Covid-19 patient characteristics were divided into

85

subgroups as following: mean age, age group (0-10 years/11–20 years/21–30 years/31–40

86

years/41–50 years/51–60 years/60 years and over), gender (male/female), nationality

87

(Vietnam/others), the history of returning from China (yes/no), the history of returning from

88

other countries (excluding China) (yes/no), and treatment status (under treatment/ discharged/

89

died).

Vietnam’ Covid-19 situation timeline was considered as a variable with two main values: (code

92

1) before lockdown end and (code 2) after lockdown end. We used both descriptive and

93

analytical method. While age data was expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD) with

94

interquartile ranges (IQR), categorical variables were presented as frequency with percentage

95

(%). We estimated the overall proportion of Covid-19 confirmed cases and its percentage before

96

and after lockdown end according to selected demographic and epidemiological characteristics.

97

Chi-square tests and Mann–Whitney U tests were utilized to compare patient’ characteristics

98

between two periods. All statistical analyses in this paper were conducted by Stata® 15

99

(StataCorp LLC, USA). The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.

100

Results

101

Among the 569 patients from 23 January to 31 July 2020, there were 268 patients by 22 April

102

and 301 patients between 23 April and 31 July (Figure 1). Figures 2 illustrated the significant

103

variation in the distribution of Covid-19 patient among different provinces between two periods.

104

The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.

105

Patients had a median age of 38.56 (SD 16.61) years, and the patients in the time after lockdown

106

end were older than those in the period before lockdown end by a median of 5 years. Overall,

107

those aged 21–30 years are recorded with the highest number of Covid-19 confirmed cases in

108

both periods (35.82% (n = 96) vs. 27.91% (n = 84)). Almost 90% (n = 241) of patients aged 59

109

years or younger before lockdown, while this figure after lockdown end was nearly 85% (n =

110

254). There was significant difference in the patient gender between two periods, 45.52% male

111

before lockdown and 61.79% male after lockdown.

112

Of 10 Covid-19 patients returned from China, 9 patients (3.36%) were in the first period and 1

113

(0.33%) was in the second period, while no difference between two periods was observed

according to the number of patients returned from other countries. Besides, the Covid-19 patient’

115

nationality between two periods was also significantly varied (Table 1).

116

Compared to the phase before lockdown with 268 discharged Covid-19 patients (100%) and no

117

Covid-19 death, post lockdown period had only 34.88% patients cured and discharged from the

118

facilities with 5 fatalities (1.66%) and 191 those being under treatment (63.46%) (Table 1).

Discussion
At the time of writing this article, the first 569 consecutive confirmed cases of Covid-19 through
31 July 2020 are utilized to compare according to two stages, before and after lockdown end in
Vietnam. Among the 569 patients, the a median age was 38.56 years, which was significantly
lower compared to recent reports in other countries such as 62.2 years in 393 patients in New
York City, U.S [14] and 50.1 years in 198 patients in Shanghai, China [15]. Age structure of
each country may be the best explanation for the difference in the confirmed case number
through two phases. The age distribution of cases was revealed with strong and important role on
Covid-19 case fatality [16]. In Vietnam, as compared to before lockdown end, the stage after
lockdown had a higher proportion of elder patients. The Covid-19 patient distribution in general
is quite similar amongst age groups and those aged 21–30 years are recorded with the highest
number of Covid-19 confirmed cases in both periods, implying that SARS-CoV-2 infection risk
considerations are not focused solely on any age group. Those in later stage are also patients
having pre-existing comorbidities, contributing to the partial explanation of 5 first fatality cases
before 31 July. In this analysis, it was observed that significant difference in the gender was
shown between two stages (45.52% male patients before lockdown end vs 61.79% male patients
after lockdown end).
Despite the more and more increasing global Covid-19 patient number with the overload of the
health system, Vietnam has still been responding well to the Covid-19 pandemic with the
mobilization of the entire political system. Significant difference was observed in the nationality
of Covid-19 patients between two phases. During the initial phase of the study timeline, 17.91%
patients (n=48) were residents of other countries, which decreased to 7.64% patients (n=23)
during phase after the lockdown end. This point is mainly because, in the time after lockdown

end, most of them are Vietnamese citizens flown home from abroad [17]. In our analysis, the
Vietnamese cases increase in the community after lockdown may be associated with the
reopening of domestic tourism in the “new normal” condition after the first Covid-19 wave and
the illegal border entry [4], [18], [19]. Current situation requires that, Vietnam’ proactive efforts
in Covid-19 control will be effective when volume, speed, and reach of travel in tourism are well
managed and the measures to closely control and monitor repatriation and immigration via its
borders are prioritized. Despite having a long borderline with China, Vietnam only recorded 9
confirmed patients returned from China at the time before lockdown end and only a case after
lockdown who had illegally immigrated to Vietnam. On the other hand, we found, the number of
Covid-19 patients who returned from other countries (excluding China) slightly increased
through two stages, however, this difference was not statistically significant. This result partially
shows that the continuous volume of people returning Vietnam from abroad during the Covid-19
epidemic. Such the detection of the Covid-19 cases from overseas is the effort of not only the
entire political system in immigration control and management of people returning from abroad
in general and but also the Vietnam Border Defense Force in particular. The more clear proof is
that, over 16,000 people illegally entering Vietnam have been prevented by the Vietnam Border
Defence Force since the beginning of 2020 and, particularly, over 2,400 people have been
arrested in July once trespassing on the trail [19].
Our study showed that the difference in the treatment status of Covid-19 patients between before
and after lockdown end. Vietnam’ early success in the Covid-19 patient treatment was proved by
the absolute figure of 268 discharged Covid-19 patients (100%) before lockdown end. Although

three months before Covid-19 outbreak point documented in the community in Da Nang on 25
July. Importantly, all new Covid-19 instances from 23 April to 25 July after lockdown were
Vietnamese people who returned from abroad and this risk group was then required to isolate for
14 days [20]. When Vietnam was retaining 99 days without any cases in the community, various
countries across the world have been faced a rapid growth in the number of new and fatal cases
of Covid-19 [21]. Since 25 July after lockdown, almost patients being treatment in Vietnam have
been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which known as the second wave of Covid-19. In such
emerging Covid-19 situation, the community transmission cases reported to be linked to the
hospitals in Da Nang where the elder patients with chronic severe diseases such as cancer,
chronic kidney disease and dialysis, heart failure, diabetes, or hypertension were being treated
[22]. Therefore, compared to the phase before lockdown end (all discharged Covid-19 patients
(100%) and no death), the post-lockdown time recorded the worse situation with mostly patients
being treated (n = 191, 63.46%) and first 5 fatalities (1.66%). It should be noted that five fatal
cases were identified at the moment of Vietnam’ second Covid-19 outbreak after the national
lockdown implementation for three months. After synthesizing current analysis data, two main
reasons associated with Vietnamese Covid-19 deaths were suggested by the Vietnamese experts.
Firstly, the new coronavirus strain detected in second wave of Covid-19 infections there had a
faster speed of infection compared to the earlier strain. However, many uncertainties have
remained concerning the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the epidemic, and its
harmfulness compared to the strain previously existed in Vietnam has been not yet known [22],
[23]. Secondly, the presence of multiple coexisting severe illness was reported in Covid-19
fatalities [24].

The present results should be viewed with the limitations. First, because the paper’ secondary
analysis data was collected from two publicly available datasets, the information of the exposure
history, clinical symptoms or signs, radiologic assessments, laboratory testing as well as the
other risks could be unknown. Second, the challenges in national large-scale coronavirus testing
resulted in the underestimated true number of Covid-19 infections. Finally, due the ongoing
Covid-19 pandemic with the more complicated situation in Vietnam, the current estimates are
temporary at the time of this writing.

Conclusions
Our short communication illustrated demographic and epidemiological disparity of Covid-19
patients before versus after loosening the national lockdown in Vietnam. The Covid-19 patient
distribution in general is quite similar amongst age groups and these patients were largely
recorded in the 21–30-year-old group in both periods. Most of the Covid-19 patients are
residents of Vietnam and Vietnamese patient number has still increased rapidly during phase
after the lockdown end. Importantly after the lockdown period, Vietnam’ proactive efforts in
Covid-19 control after lockdown end will be effective when the measures to closely control and
monitor repatriation and immigration via its borders are strictly enforced.
