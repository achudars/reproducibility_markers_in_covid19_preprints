ABSTRACT
Objectives
To assess seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a densely populated
urban Indian settings and its implications for disease trends and protective immunity.
Design
Cross-sectional sero-epidemiological survey linked with administrative reporting of
COVID-19 testing data.
Settings
Pune city in western India
Main outcome measure
Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies were estimated and along
with correlates of virus neutralisation and other immune and inflammatory markers.
Results
Seropositivity was extensive (51·3%; 95%CI 39·9 to 62·4) but varied widely in the
five localities tested, ranging from 35·8% to 66·4%. Seropositivity was higher in
crowded living conditions in the slums (OR 1·91), and was lower in those 65 years or
older (OR 0·59). The infection-fatality ratio was estimated at 0.21%. Post survey,
COVID-19 incidence was lower in areas noted to have higher seroprevalence.
Substantial virus-neutralising activity was observed in seropositive individuals, but
with considerable heterogeneity in the immune response and possible agedependent diversity in the antibody repertoire.
Conclusion
Despite crowded living conditions having facilitated widespread transmission, the
variability in seroprevalence in localities that are in geographical proximity indicates a
heterogenous spread of infection. Declining infection rates in areas with high
seropositivity suggest population-level protection. It is also supported by substantial
neutralising activity in asymptomatically infected individuals. This is the first report of
a significantly high proportion of protective immune response among asymptomatic
individuals in the population. The heterogeneity in antibody levels and neutralisation
capacity indicates the existence of immunological sub-groups of functional interest.

INTRODUCTION
Examining the seroprevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies in areas with significant spread of the virus is
important for estimating the proportion of the population infected by the virus. In
addition, seroprevalence studies can clarify the spread of asymptomatic infection
and provide insights into the extent to which apparently low infection (and case)
fatality rates have been confounded by prevalent testing strategies. High
seropositivity in communities may modify transmission rates through population-level
protection. The survey of literature (up to 2 Nov 2020) indicated that community
serosurveys for SARS-CoV-2 in LICs and LMICs have been limited and have largely
reported correlations of seroprevalence with demographic factors. Only a few studies
in the general population report double-digit seropositivity. Of these, most are from
high-income/upper-middle-income countries1 2 with only a few from low-income and
lower-middle-income countries (LICs/LMICs)1 3. Notably, the latter studies have
reported very high seroprevalence1 3. There are no reports of protective immunityassociated characteristics in community surveillance settings from LMIC/LICs. In
fact, such studies from the global North are also limited. The existing evidence thus
lacks granular details critical to understand community-level heterogeneities, and
provides limited epidemiological data without meaningful immunobiological
correlates.
The spread of COVID-19 is likely to be affected by local demographics, socioeconomic conditions, the history and burden of infectious diseases as well as
biological factors but there are very few studies from LMICs with sufficient local
granularity and none explore disease prevalence vis-à-vis correlates of protective
immunity.
Pune, a metropolitan city in Western India, recorded its first confirmed case of
COVID-19 on March 9, 2020 and by November 24, 2020 has reported 167,604
cases and 4,440 deaths. We undertook a cross-sectional sero-epidemiological study
in five high-incidence administrative subwards of Pune to estimate the cumulative
burden of the disease in these communities and to examine the associated riskfactors. As antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike
protein are predominantly associated with neutralising activity, we estimated the
seroprevalence of anti-RBD IgG (RBD-IgG) antibodies4 5.

Given the high proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections6, investigating
the putative correlates of immune protection in such individuals is necessary to
understand the basis of community-level protection. The immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection is expected to be heterogeneous within populations and an
understanding of this diversity is likely to be central to the management of the
disease. We have therefore characterised the RBD-specific antibody responses for
their ability to prevent cellular receptor binding, as well as for virus neutralisation.
Finally, elevated markers of inflammation have been associated with poor prognosis
in clinical cases of COVID-197 8, and unresolved systemic inflammation is
increasingly being thought to underlie some of the heterogeneous, long-term
sequelae of COVID-199-13. However, it is not clear if inflammation is associated with
asymptomatic infections. Thus, we have also tested a parameter of systemic
inflammation in the sampled population.

METHODS
Study design, setting and analysis of seroprevalence
The PMC administrative area is divided into 41 subwards with an average population
of 76,394 per subward. Based on the incidence of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19
cases as on 31 May 2020, we stratified the sub-wards as low (<0.62 per 1000),
medium (0.61 to 2.5 per 1000), and high incidence (>2.5 per 1000) settings. Five
subwards were randomly selected from among the 13 subwards (~400,000
population) classified as high incidence settings for a sero-epidemiological survey.
The sampling strategy is summarized as a flow chart in Figure 1. An independent
team of geospatial experts divided the 5 selected subwards into 235 polygonal grids
of roughly equal area and randomly selected 63 of the 235 grids for sampling (12-14
grids per subward). From the approximate center of each grid, participants were
recruited from every fifth house with sequential recruitment in multi-occupancy
tenements as well. One consenting adult per household, above 18 years of age was
selected following a pre-decided age and sex distribution criteria14.
Active containment zones were excluded because of operational challenges.
Currently ill, febrile individuals were excluded, though, those who had an illness
episode, including COVID-19, in the past but were well at recruitment remained
eligible for recruitment.
The study team visited selected households and after written informed consent, five
ml of peripheral venous blood was collected. Blood samples were stored in icepacks
and transported to the laboratory for processing within 5 hours of collection.
Study subjects and sample size
Considering a possible 15% serological prevalence in the selected clusters, for a
relative precision of 20%, a confidence interval of 95%, and with a design effect of
2.5, 1360 participants would be required. The sample size was inflated by 20% to
account for inadequate samples and uniform recruitments from each cluster.

Serum isolation and immunoassays
Serum was separated using standard methods and stored in multiple aliquots. The
in-house THSTI RBD-IgG ELISA was performed using methods previously

described15. We assumed that the IgG antibodies are detectable 14 to 21 days postinfection and that these antibodies persist, following infection, for four months4 16 17.
No adjustments were made for assay accuracy and the potential impact of declining
antibodies on seroprevalence.
ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT; Genscript), SARS-CoV-2 S1
IgA ELISA (Eurimmune) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ELISA (Diagnostic
Biochem) were performed according to manufacturer’s protocols.
SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) virus expanded in Vero E6 cells was used
with heat-inactivated sera for Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests (PRNTs). The
PRNT50 neutralisation titres are the inverse endpoint dilutions of sera that could
neutralize 50% of viral plaque formation.

Statistical methods and presentation of results
The analysis accounted for the multistage clustered survey methods by assigning
sampling weightage to adjust for the probability of selection of each sampling unit.
Logistic regression with linearized standard errors was used for examining factors
associated with being seropositive. The reproduction numbers at different time points
were estimated for each sub ward using EpiEstim package18. To estimate the
association between seroprevalence and incidence of new cases post survey we
performed a linear regression for the incidence of new cases, adjusting for the
reported incidence at the beginning of the survey. We did not adjust prevalence for
imperfect test sensitivity, since there is currently no gold standard for comparison
and as the sensitivity of the assay used compared favourably with other assays15.
We estimated IFR as the ratio of the number of reported COVID-19 deaths by 23
July 2020 to the estimated number of infected individuals in the population. We
assumed a 13 day median interval between infection and mortality among those who
died19 and that seroprevalence reflects incidence two weeks prior to survey.
Variables, data sources, and bias
We obtained demographic and household characteristics and collected information
on potential risk factors including occupation, exposure to SARS CoV-2 including
travel history during the lockdown period, experience of symptoms and history of

questionnaire at the initial survey.
Statistical tests and software
Analyses were performed using STATA v14.2 13.1, R Statistical Software v2.14.0
and GraphPad Prism v8.1.2. Spearman’s non-parametric correlation analysis was
done for dual datasets. Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s
post-test was used to compare across groups. SPSS was used for regression
analysis of sex and age data with serological tests and categorical comparisons
made using the Chi-square test.

RESULTS
Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies
Between 20th July and 5th August 2020,1659 eligible, consenting adult participants
were recruited from 2089 screened individuals (Figure 1). The study recruited 801
women and 858 men from the five subwards with demographic characteristics as
shown in Table 1. 857 individuals tested positive for the anti-RBD IgG ELISA. The
sample weighted seroprevalence was estimated at 51·3% (95%CI 39·9 to 62·4).
Notably, there was considerable heterogeneity in seroprevalence between clusters
(Table 2; Figure 2). Kasbapeth-Somvarpeth subward had the lowest seroprevalence
at 35·8% (95%CI 29·2 to 43·1) while the Lohiyanagar subward had the highest
seroprevalence of 66·4% (95%CI 57·8 to 74·1). The differences in seroprevalence
by characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 2. The
seroprevalence across age-groups was uniform in those under 66 years of age. The
oldest age-group had a significantly lower seroprevalence of 38.4% (Figure 3A;
Table 2; p=0·03).
Those living in densely populated slums had a higher seroprevalence (Table 2;
Figure 3B; 59·2%; 95%CI 48·8 to 68·9) as compared to those living in non-slum
areas (34·4%; 95%CI 26·6 to 43·7) and 63.4%(95%CI 52.9 to 72.8) of those living in
crowded dwellings with < 5 m2 per capita floor space were seropositive compared to
35.8% (95%CI 27·4 to 44·1) for those with ≥ 10 m2 (Table 2; Figure 3C). Similarly,
those using a shared toilet had a seroprevalence of 61·7% (95%CI 49·8 to 2·4)
compared to 45·3% (95%CI 33·6 to 57·5) among those who did not (Table 2; Figure
3D). The presence of chronic illness, travel history, working status, exposure to
COVID-19 patient, history of quarantine, participation in social gatherings, self/family
members working in health care set up did not reveal any significant association with
seropositivity.
Multiple logistic regression model revealed lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity
among those above 65 years of age (OR 0·59; 95%CI 0·36 to 0·98; p=0.044) as
compared to those between 18-30 years (Table 3). Living in slums (OR 1·91; 95%CI
1·34 to 2·73; p=0.007) or in dwellings with per-capita floor space <5 m2 (OR 2·09;
95%CI 1·43 to 3·04) were also identified as independent risk factors for seropositivity
(Table 3).

The instantaneous reproduction number (R) declined following lockdown but
remained largely above 1.0 (Figure 4 A-E). The reported incidence of COVID-19
after the serosurvey (between Aug 01 and Nov 23) was associated with
seroprevalence in each subward (Slope=-0·74, p=0·007), after adjusting for the
reported incidence at initiation of serosurvey (Figure 4 F).
Using Government mortality data from the sampled sub-wards, we calculated an
overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) of 0.21%, that was highest in KasbapethSomwarpeth (0·28%) and lowest in Navipeth-Parvati (0·17%) (Figure 5). Older agegroups had higher IFRs compared to younger age-groups (Figure 5).

Receptor-binding inhibition activity in the asymptomatic population
From the 857 RBD-IgG positive sera, 697 samples were randomly selected and
tested for the ability to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human ACE-2
using a specific ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT)20. 85·1% of
the RBD-IgG positive sera were sVNT positive.
While 57·2% of 18-30 years age-group showed ≥50% inhibition, this increased to
64% in the 31-50 years category and became 75% in the population above 50 years
(p<0.001). However, no association was found with sex.
An explanation for the age-association could be the association of RBD-binding
antibody levels with age, as high sVNT values are likely to be positively correlated
with high RBD-binding activity. The RBD-IgG ELISA signal to cut-off ratio (S/Co) was
indeed positively correlated with the % inhibition of RBD-ACE-2 binding (Figure 6A;
R = 0·718; 95%CI 0·634 to 0·717; p<0·0001) and higher levels of surrogate
neutralisation was observed in RBD-IgG high S/Co (≥3) samples compared to low
RBD-IgG (Figure 6B; p<0.0001). However, the RBD-IgG levels were not associated
with age, making the sVNT association with age mechanistically intriguing.
To explore the heterogeneity in the association between RBD-IgG and surrogate
neutralisation (Figure 6A,D), we classified the response into four categories (across
high/low RBD-IgG and high/low surrogate neutralization) using arbitrary cutoffs of 3
(RBD-IgG S/Co) and 50% (surrogate neutralization). We found no correlation with
either age or sex in these four categories. The heterogeneity in the response was
interesting in two distinct ways. The high RBD-IgG/low-inhibition group (6.2%)

indicates that a significant subpopulation may not be well protected despite having
high RBD-IgG. The presence of a large high-inhibition/low RBD-IgG sub-population
(23.2%) was also intriguing.
A possible explanation for the low RBD-IgG/high-inhibition group were non-IgG RBDbinding antibodies. We therefore tested a subset of 639 samples for IgA against the
S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 68·4% of the RBD-IgG positive sera
were also S1-IgA positive. Of the RBD-IgG negative sera, only 8·6% had detectable
S1-IgA. S1-IgA S/Co was positively correlated with the surrogate neutralisation
(Figure 6C; R=0·623; 95%CI 0·557 to 0·681; p<0·0001). 79·21% of samples with
≥50% inhibition in the sVNT were S1-IgA positive (Figure 6D). Both S1-IgA as well
as RBD-IgG levels were higher in the high sVNT category (Figure 6E, F). The low
RBD-IgG/high-inhibition category also had a high proportion of S1-IgA positivity
(78·05%) compared to low RBD-low inhibition category (18·99%) (Figure 6D). RBDIgG and S1-IgA double-positive sera were associated with significantly higher
surrogate neutralisation than RBD-IgG single positive (Figure
6G; p<0.0001). However, neither the frequencies of S1-IgA positivity nor the S1-IgA
S/Co values were different between the low versus high RBD-IgG subgroups within
the high inhibition category (Figure 6D,H), suggesting the possibility of a more
complex biological basis for the low RBD-IgG/high-inhibition subgroup.
In summary, there is significant surrogate neutralisation in the sera of individuals
asymptomatically infected with SARS-CoV-2 with likely contributions from both IgG
and IgA antibodies. However, this functional response shows considerable
heterogeneity, with patterns of variation suggesting age-associated diversity in the
antibody repertoire.

Virus (pandemic strain) neutralising activity correlates with RBD-IgG and
surrogate neutralisation
To estimate the association of RBD-IgG with neutralising activity, we evaluated
neutralising activity in a subset of sampled sera (n=192) by estimating PRNT50
values. Compared to RBD-IgG negative sera (median titreneg=0), both low and high
levels of RBD-IgG positive sera had significantly higher neutralising antibody titres

(Figure 7A; median titre≤3=80, IQR 20-320, p≤3<0·0001; median titre≥3=320, IQR 1601280, p≥3<0·0001).
Similarly, compared to sVNT negative sera (median titreneg=0), substantial virus
neutralising titres were observed in sera with both low and high inhibition in the sVNT
(Figure 7B; median titre≤50%=120, IQR 40-400, p≤50%<0·0001; median titre≥50%=320,
IQR 160-1280, p≥50%<0·0001).
These results indicate a strong association of both RBD-IgG levels and surrogate
neutralisation with live virus neutralization activity in vitro.

Systemic inflammation in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections
We evaluated C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for systemic inflammation21, levels
in all the samples collected. No gross differences were found in CRP levels between
the RBD-IgG positive and negative sera. Thus, there was no evidence of residual
systemic inflammation in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. In both groups,
women and those aged over 50 years had higher CRP levels (≥3000 ng/ml; data not
shown). Interestingly, sera with high levels of surrogate neutralisation (≥ 50%) also
showed significantly higher CRP levels (Figure 8; p=0.0014). It may be recalled here
that high sVNT inhibition levels were associated with older age groups that also have
higher CRP levels. However, high RBD-IgG levels were not associated with high
CRP levels, just as they were not associated with age, making the age and CRP
association with surrogate neutralisation of substantive biological interest.

DISCUSSION
This is the first systematic study (at the time of submission) from a LMIC reporting
community SARS-CoV-2 sero-surveillance of high granularity alongside estimation of
correlates of immune protection. We estimated seroprevalence as well as serological
correlates of protection in a cross-sectional cohort of 1659 asymptomatic participants
from five small urban localities in the metropolitan city of Pune, India. IgG
seroprevalence was determined against the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, to aid correlation with immune protection since RBD is
the predominant target for neutralising antibodies. Large subsets of the sera were
also tested for surrogate neutralisation as well as live SARS-CoV-2 virus
neutralisation, data not so far reported in community sero-surveillance studies.
Analysis of anti-RBD IgG seroprevalence revealed extensive SARS-CoV-2 infection
in the sampled population. Despite the proximity of the sampled subwards within
Pune city, there was variation across these locations suggesting that local factors
influence prevalence. Across the subwards, the seroprevalence was higher amongst
slum dwellers compared to those living in apartments and bungalows. Residential
crowding and shared sanitation were associated with increased seroprevalence.
Collectively, these observations suggest high intrafamilial transmission, though our
sampling strategy precluded direct analysis.
While infection risk was similar between men and women, the seroprevalence in the
elderly population (65+ age-group) was lower than the younger population. This
observation is in contrast to what has been reported from Delhi22 and Mumbai3 but
concordant with trends reported from meta-analysis of global studies1. Our
observation might reflect limited mobility and higher compliance with preventive
measures in this age-group. A lower IgG response to infection and/or accelerated
seroreversion in the older population is also possible. However, the latter may not be
likely as no association with age was found for either RBD-IgG or S1-IgA levels.
We estimated an overall IFR of 0.21% based on reported fatalities. This is consistent
with a global median IFR of 0.27%, estimated from a meta-analysis of multiple
studies23. The IFR ranged from 0.17% to 0.28% across the subwards and in line with
reports from multiple studies world-wide23, the IFR increased with age.

The substantial locality-specific variations in seropositivity levels and infection fatality
rates (IFRs) highlight heterogeneities of infection behaviour even in dense, urban
populations often lost in more global analyses.
An inverse correlation was observed between subward-level seroprevalence and the
number of positive cases reported in the subsequent period which persisted after
adjusting for baseline disease incidence rates to account for any biased testing. This
observation revealed a strong negative association with seropositivity, indicating
potential modification of transmission by community immunity. This also suggests
population-level protection, at least in the short-term when seroprevalence
approaches herd immunity threshold. These trends should be interpreted with
caution given our dependence on publicly available data and limited understanding
of the durability of immune responses.
We used RBD-IgG for our analysis of seroprevalence. Compared to nucleocapsid
IgGs, anti-RBD/Spike IgGs are strongly correlated with virus neutralising activity,
have higher sensitivity, and display comparatively less cross-reactivity to other
coronaviruses4 5 24. We leveraged this to directly test for virus neutralising activity by
estimating the inhibition of Spike protein binding to the ACE-2 receptor. 85.1% of the
asymptomatic population showed surrogate neutralisation. RBD-IgG and sVNT
positivity were both correlated with significant neutralisation titres in PRNTs. Thus
elevated RBD-IgG and surrogate neutralisation are robust predictors of virus
neutralising activity.
The RBD-IgG S/Co was strongly correlated with surrogate neutralisation, though
significant heterogeneity was observed around this response. Approximately 30% of
individuals showed significant departures from this correlation, underlining significant
immune response heterogeneities. This heterogeneity may be of biological and
clinical relevance but we found no association with either age or sex. Non-IgG
antibody isotypes were speculated to contribute to the low RBD-IgG/high inhibition
category. Since the IgM response is relatively more transient4, IgA was evaluated.
However, neither the proportion or levels of IgA differed significantly between the low
RBD-IgG/high inhibition and high RBD-IgG/high-inhibition categories. Therefore, it is
plausible that individuals in this category may have developed functionally different
antibody repertoires. This could consist of a greater prominence of neutralising
epitopes or antibodies with greater affinity, since inhibition/neutralisation activity

would be more sensitive to affinity than binding activity. Interestingly, the older
population showed high levels of surrogate neutralisation more frequently than the
young, yet there was no age association with the IgG and IgA response. This could
imply a shift in the epitope dominance towards neutralizing epitopes, and/or higher
affinities in the older population.
68·4% of RBD-IgG positive individuals were also S1-IgA positive. As anti-RBD IgA is
short-lived in comparison to anti-RBD IgG4, the double-positive population may
represent more recent infections. Given the higher surrogate neutralisation activity in
the double-positive individuals, it could be speculated that immune protection may
wane over time. This has implications on population-level protection from infection.
Unlike in symptomatic cases7-10, there was no difference in CRP levels between the
seropositive and seronegative populations indicating the absence of chronic
elevation of systemic inflammation in asymptomatic infections. The association of
higher CRP levels with higher inhibition levels, without a corresponding association
with RBD-IgG or IgA levels, is more likely to reflect the age correlation of high
inhibition levels, rather than any specific association between persistent inflammation
and high inhibition activity.
Our study had several limitations. We focussed on the seroprevalence in settings
reporting the highest incidence, in part due to concerns about the impact of imperfect
diagnostic accuracy on seroprevalence in low prevalence settings. This along with
the limited sample size made it challenging to extrapolate seroprevalence more
broadly. For operational reasons, we excluded active containment zones, those with
an acute illness and restricted sampling to one individual per household; these could
have biased the seroprevalence estimates. Our study did not include children who
may have an important role in transmission.
Nonetheless, this study, demonstrates the heterogenous, but widespread
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a dense urban population. The high seroprevalence
combined with evidence of neutralizing antibodies and of declining incidence in
settings of high seroprevalence raises the possibility of population immunity, at least
in the short term.
That indoor crowding, living in a slum and sharing a common toilet were significant
predictors of seropositivity highlights the challenges India faced in controlling the
pandemic despite stringent lockdown measures. Despite this, the relative protection

of the elderly, and low infection fatality ratios and evidence of population immunity
provide hope that if control measures continue, urban India may well have passed
the peak of the pandemic. High seroprevalence in the dense urban localities of the
study site, despite a protracted and stringent lockdown, provides a realistic account
on transmission dynamics crucial for public health policies in LMICs. Microgeographic variability within locales, dominated by sub-optimal living conditions,
needs to be acknowledged and used to develop measures designed for people in
such socio-economic contexts. As a next step, further assessment of the immunity
and infection rates in settings of high seroprevalence in other majorly affected cities
are needed. The heterogeneity of correlation between RBD seropositivity and
neutralising capacity, as well as the complex association with age encountered in
this study open up a plethora of research questions into epitope dominance and
affinity variations in anti-viral antibodies in asymptomatic infection.
