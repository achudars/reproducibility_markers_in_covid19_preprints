Abstract:
A recent report found that rare predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants across 13 candidate genes in
TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN pathways explain up to 3.5% of severe COVID-19 cases. We performed
whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing of 1,934 COVID-19 cases (713 with severe and 1,221 with mild
disease) and 15,251 ancestry-matched population controls across four independent COVID-19 biobanks.
We then tested if rare pLOF variants in these 13 genes were associated with severe COVID-19. We
identified only one rare pLOF mutation across these genes amongst 713 cases with severe COVID-19 and
observed no enrichment of pLOFs in severe cases compared to population controls or mild COVID-19
cases. We find no evidence of association of rare loss-of-function variants in the proposed 13 candidate
genes with severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Main Text:
Host genetic factors related to COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes are of great interest, as their
identification could elucidate the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity, thereby providing
clues about potential therapeutic targets. Recently, Zhang et al.1 reported deleterious mutations in 13
candidate genes involved in type I IFN immunity to be associated with COVID-19 severity. The authors
reported a significant enrichment in predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants in 659 severe COVID-19
cases relative to 534 controls with asymptomatic or benign infection using a burden test under a dominant
model of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 8.28 [1.04-65.64], p=0.01). In addition to the nine pLOFs in cases
used in the burden test, they detected 109 missense or in-frame indels and tested them experimentally
in ad hoc overexpression systems; 24 variants (including all the pLOFs) were found to be hypomorphic
and were detected in 23 patients of various ages (17-77 years) and of both sexes. The authors reported
the presence of one pLOF in controls but did not provide the total number of other functional variants, or
whether variants identified in controls were experimentally tested as well. The authors concluded that
rare deleterious variants in the TLR3, IRF7 and IRF9-dependent type 1 interferon pathway genes explain
up to 3.5% of severe cases of COVID-19.
We aimed to replicate these findings using independent datasets. We note that an exact replication of all
the reported associations is not possible because the study design of Zhang et al does not permit a formal
statistical comparison of the same variant types in cases and controls. The reason for this is that missense
variants were reported as functionally characterized in cases but not controls, so the counts of functionally

compromised missense variants cannot be evaluated in a statistical test. In order to test the role for rare
variation in these genes in COVID-19 outcomes, we therefore performed association tests on all rare
variation that is apparently functional, and specifically focused on predicted loss-of-function variants,
applying identical rules to case and control variants, as is appropriate in such analyses.
Our first analysis was based on the cohort of patients recruited by the Columbia University COVID-19
Biobank (Tables 1 and 2). We performed exome sequencing of 1,153 COVID-19 cases of diverse ethnicities
who were treated at Columbia University Irving Medical Center at the peak of the New York pandemic,
between March and May, 2020. Of 1,153 cases, 480 had severe COVID-19 that led to death or required
endotracheal intubation due to respiratory failure (Table 2 and Methods). In an attempt to replicate the
findings by Zheng et al., we performed a gene-set based collapsing association test stratified by ancestry
using 9,589 population controls of similar ancestries (see Methods).
When testing for pLOF variants with an internal and external minor allele frequency of less than 0.001 in
any of the 13 genes of interest (see Methods), we did not detect any variant enrichment in cases (OR =
1.10 [0.03-7.67], p = 1). In fact, only one of the cases and 23 of the controls had a qualifying pLOF variant
(0.21% vs. 0.24%). We also note that the carrier frequency in controls was dependent on genetic ancestry
and ranged from 0 to 0.43% across different ancestral clusters. Interestingly, one of the pLOFs reported
by Zhang et al. to be present in their cases was present in multiple controls from the Columbia University
COVID-19 Biobank (Table 3). The addition of rare missense variants in the functional model also did not
improve enrichment (OR = 1.22 [0.84-1.71], p = 0.3).
We additionally tested 480 patients with severe disease against 673 patients with milder disease that
recovered from COVID-19 without the need for intubation, and again we observed no clear enrichment
(OR = 1.45, [0.02-113.51], p = 1). Similarly, even when adding missense variants, we did not detect an
enrichment (OR = 1.13 [0.74-1.72], p = 0.6). We also looked for any variants in the 13 genes that were
listed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar but could not find any in our 480 severe cases. Based
on our power calculations, we have over 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.5 or greater for rare pLOF
variants at an alpha of 0.05. We are therefore well powered to replicate the findings by Zhang et al. given
their reported odds ratio of 8.0 (Figure 1).
The second cohort included patients recruited by the Biobanque Québec COVID-19. In total, 533
participants were recruited at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal and underwent genome sequencing
in partnership with the Canadian HostSeq project. This cohort included 62 severe COVID-19 cases with
respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilatory support. An additional 471 patients were treated as

controls and included 158 individuals with mild COVID-19 that did not require ventilatory support and 313
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative participants. We tested for enrichment of pLOF variants in the 62 severe COVID19 cases compared to the 471 controls (see Methods) but did not detect a single pLOF in any of the cases
or controls, even when we used a more relaxed minor allele frequency threshold of less than 1%. Similarly,
we observed no significant enrichment under the missense model (OR = 1.24 [0.36-3.46], p = 0.59).
The third cohort was recruited in Saudi Arabia and sequenced in partnership with the Saudi Genome
project. Exome sequencing was performed in 307 patients with COVID-19, including 148 severe cases, 159
participants with mild COVID-19 and 218 COVID-19 PCR negative controls. (see Methods). We could not
find any cases with a rare pLOF or missense variant in any of the 13 tested genes.
The fourth cohort was collected by the Qatar Genome Project. Of 14,060 Qatar biobank participants with
genome sequence data, there were 700 patients with COVID-19 of which 60 were defined as severe cases
and 640 were mild or asymptomatic cases (see Methods). Limiting the analysis to unrelated individuals,
there were 5,385 participants including 23 severe COVID-19 and 231 mild or asymptomatic COVID-19
samples. We did not find any individuals with rare pLOF variants in the 13 genes analyzed and also could
not find any with a rare missense variant in COVID-19 samples.
In a meta-analysis of all four cohorts, we were also not able to detect any significant enrichment for pLOFs
(OR = 1.10 [0.03-7.67], p = 1) or pLOFs and missense variants combined (OR = 1.17 [0.83-1.63], p = 0.34).
In summary, in our analysis of four international COVID-19 biobanks including a total of 1,934 sequenced
COVID-19 cases (713 severe and 1,221 mild), we could only find a single rare pLOF variant in a severe case
and another single rare pLOF variant in a case with mild disease. We therefore observed no enrichment
in pLOF variants in type I IFN immunity genes among cases of severe COVID-19 compared to mildly
affected patients or to ancestry-matched population controls.
These results are further corroborated by a recent analysis of exomes from participants in the UK Biobank
performed by Regeneron Inc.2 In the association testing of 1,184 COVID-19 cases vs. 422,318 controls, there
was no association between pLOFs at these genes after careful adjustment for population stratification and
multiple testing. Moreover, there was no association signal when the association tests were repeated
including rare deleterious missense variants, or when the case group was limited only to severe COVID-19
cases (N=471).
Between this study and the independent report by Regeneron Inc, there were a total of 3,118 cases of
COVID-19, including 1,184 cases with severe disease used to test this hypothesis. Despite large sample size,

our collective results did not support the key conclusion by Zheng et al. that 3.5% of severe COVID-19 cases
are explained by rare inborn errors in type I interferon immunity genes. While the age of our case cohort
is slightly higher (mean age 65.9 years in our study vs. mean age 51.8 years in Zheng et al), the age of variant
carriers reported by Zheng et al. ranged from 17 to 77 years, and the great majority of our cases fall within
this range. Further, we have not undertaken any functional studies of missense variants identified in our
cohorts. We also recognize that the inheritance pattern for deleterious variants in type I IFN immunity
genes is often recessive, and that the penetrance of such variants might be dependent on male sex.
However, Zheng et al. found bi-allelic variants only in a small number of cases and analyzed deleterious
variants in both sexes jointly. Taken together, our negative results suggest that the findings by Zheng et al
are not generalizable and highlight the need to rigorously adhere to accepted study design principles when
reporting new genetic associations for a set of candidate genes3,4.

Methods:
Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank Cohort:
The study includes a multiethnic cohort of 1,153 COVID-19 patients treated at the Columbia University
Irving Medical Center. All cases had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were recruited to
the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank between March and May 2020, at the peak of the New York
pandemic. A total of 480 patients were classified as having severe COVID-19. All 480 severe COVID-19
cases were defined by either death from COVID-19 (N=317), or acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19
requiring endotracheal intubation (N=163). This cohort was composed of 288 males and 192 females; the
average age was 67 (range 2-101); 45% of the participants were predicted to be Hispanic/Latino, 40%
African, 6% Middle Eastern, 6% European, 2% East Asian, 0.6% South Asian, and 0.2 % Admixed (see below
for details about ancestry determination).
For comparisons of variant frequencies, we used an internal dataset of 9,589 local population controls
with exome and genome sequence data generated by Columbia University’s Institute for Genomic
Medicine (IGM). The controls are derived from the same general patient population as the cases, served
by the Columbia University Irving Medical Center and sequenced as controls or healthy family members
for other studies. Additional tests were performed against a cohort of 673 patients with mild COVID-19
who were recruited to Columbia COVID-19 Biobank during the same time period, but who have recovered
without the need for endotracheal intubation. This group was composed of 357 males and 316 females;

the average age was 59 (range 3-97); 43% of the participants were predicted to be Hispanic/Latino, 40%
African, 8% Middle Eastern, 6% European, 2% East Asian, and 0.6% South Asian.
All case exomes were captured with the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel V1.0 (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) and sequenced on Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA) platform with 150 bp paired-end reads according to standard protocols. Exome sequencing of
controls were performed on Illumina’s HiSeq 2000, HiSeq 2500, and NovaSeq 6000 using various exome
capture kits. Genome controls were all sequenced on Illumina’s NovaSeq 6000.
All cases and controls were processed with the same bioinformatic pipeline for variant calling. In brief,
reads were aligned to human reference GRCh37 using DRAGEN (Edico Genome, San Diego, CA, USA)5 and
duplicates were marked with Picard (Broad Institute, Boston, MA, USA). Variants were called according to
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK - Broad Institute, Boston, MA, USA) Best Practices recommendations

ATAV9

(https://github.com/igm-team/atav) was used to add custom annotations including gnomAD v2.1
frequencies10 and clinical annotations provided by the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)11,
ClinVar12,13, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). A centralized database was used to store
variant and per site coverage data for all samples enabling well controlled analyses without the need of
generating jointly called VCF files (see Ren et al. 20209 for details). For each patient, we performed
ancestry classification into one of the six major ancestry groups (European, African, Latino, East Asian,
South Asian and Middle Eastern) using a neural network trained on a set of 1000 Genomes samples with
known ancestry labels. We used a 50% probability cut-off to assign an ancestry label to each sample and
labeled samples that did not reach 50% for any of the ancestral groups as “Admixed”.
All included samples had at least 90% of the consensus coding sequence (CCDS release 20)14 covered at
10x or more. Samples had ≤ 3% contamination levels according to VerifyBamID15. Additionally, we
removed samples with a discordance between self-declared and sequence-derived gender. We used
KING16 for the detection of related individuals and removed one of each pair that had an inferred
relationship of second-degree or closer while favoring the inclusion of COVID-19 cases over controls.
For ancestry adjustment, we performed Principal Component Analysis on a set of predefined variants as
previously described in Cameron-Christie et al.17 To identify clusters that reflect ancestry we applied the
Louvain method of community detection18 to the first 6 principal components (PCs) resulting in 10 clusters
reflecting not only continental populations, but also more detailed subdivision of Europeans. We

performed coverage harmonization (see below) and collapsing within the clusters so that population
specific variants would be easier to filter out.
Coverage differences between cases and controls caused by different capture kits or sequencing depth in
general can potentially introduce a bias in the analysis because without sufficient coverage no variants
can be called4. Therefore, we used the site-based pruning approach described in Petrovski et al. 201519
and removed sites with an absolute difference in percentages of cases compared to controls with at least
10x coverage of greater than 7.0%.
Using the genes tested by Zhang et al. (TLR3, UNC93B1, TICAM1, TRAF3, TBK1, IRF3, IRF7, IFNAR1, IFNAR2,
STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, and IKBKG), we performed a gene set-based collapsing analysis to test for a significant
difference in the proportion of cases carrying at least one qualifying variant (QV) in the gene set compared
to controls. A QV was defined as a variant that passes certain filter criteria. For the pLOF model we used
basic quality control filters (e.g. GATK’s Variant Quality Score Recalibration, QUAL, GQ, QD, …), an internal
and external minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.001 and restricted the variant effect to frameshift, stop
gained, splice acceptor, and splice donor labeled high confidence by LOFTEE10. For the internal MAF filter
we used a leave-one-out filter, that ensures that singletons are retained even if the sample size is small.
For the external MAF filtering we used the continental MAFs provided by gnomAD10 and ExAC20. For the
functional model, we also included missense variants in addition to the pLOF variants while keeping all
other filters the same. From the results of the individual clusters, we extracted the number of
cases/controls with and without a QV in the gene-set and used the exact two-sided Cochran-MantelHaenszel (CMH) test21,22 to test for an association between disease status and QV status while controlling
for cluster membership.
For the purpose of the meta-analysis of all four cohorts, we restricted the Biobanque Québec cohort (see
below) to individuals of European ancestry and only included population controls, so the final analysis
included a total of 696 severe COVID-19 cases and 15,047 population controls. We used the CMH test as
described above and treated the other cohorts as additional clusters, since each of the extra cohorts was
composed of a single well-defined ancestry. The CMH odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were
reported.

Biobanque Québec COVID-19 Cohort:
The Biobanque Québec COVID-19 (www.BQC19.ca) is a provincial biobank that prospectively enrolls
patients with suspected COVID-19, or COVID-19 confirmed through SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. For this

study, we used results from patients with available WGS data and who were recruited at the Jewish
General Hospital (JGH) in Montreal. The JGH is a university affiliated hospital serving a large multi-ethnic
adult population and was designated as the primary COVID-19 reference center by the Québec
government early in the pandemic. In total, there were 533 participants with WGS, including 62 cases of
COVID-19 who required ventilatory support (BiPAP, high flow oxygen, or endotracheal intubation) or died,
128 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized but did not require invasive ventilatory support, 30
individuals with COVID-19 did not require hospitalization, and 313 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative participants.
Using genetic principal component analysis derived from genome-wide genotyping, we determined that
76% of participants were of European ancestry, 9% were of African ancestry, 7% were of east Asian
ancestry, and 5% were of south Asian ancestry.
We performed WGS at a mean depth of 30x on all included individuals using Illumina’s Novaseq 6000
platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing results were analyzed using the McGill Genome
Center bioinformatics pipelines23, in accordance with Genome Analysis Toolkit Best Practices (GATK)
recommendations7. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome. Variant quality control was
performed using the variantRecalibrator and applyVQSR functions from GATK. Participants had a median
of 4434 (IQR: 4260-5194) autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms of minor allele frequency less than
1% across their exomes (defined using the GENCODE24 reference for protein coding exonic sites). Variant
filtering was followed by sample filtering on missing rate (minimum 97% of sites called) and minimum
average read depth (≥ 20x). Genotypes were further filtered by genotype quality (≥20x) and read depth
(≥10x).
Predicted LOF variants were annotated using LOFTEE10 and the analysis was restricted to the genes tested
in Zhang et al. Missense variants were annotated using VEP. Qualifying variants with minor allele
frequency < 0.1% annotated as high confidence for LOF or as missense variants and which passed quality
control filters were extracted for the main analysis. Using these variants, we used Fisher’s exact test to
perform a burden test restricted to individuals of European ancestry comparing 45 of the 62 severe cases
of COVID-19 to 361 controls.

at King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh,
Ministry of Health, and King Fahad Medical City. The Institutional Review Boards of all participating
hospitals also approved the study and all patients provided written informed consent. In total, we
performed WES on 307 individuals with COVID-19, which included 148 (48%) cases of severe disease that
required mechanical ventilation or admission to an intensive care unit for septic shock or organ failure
and 159 (52%) patients with mild or asymptomatic disease. Our control group included 218 individuals
negative by SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The 159 severe cases included 32% females and 68% males, and the 148
mild/asymptomatic patients were 44% females and 56% males. The age of the 307 patients included in
this study ranged from 6 months to 98 years old. All samples were of Arab ancestry.
WES was performed using Ion Torrent S5 XL System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA USA) includes
the Torrent Suite™ Software package, which automatically processes sequences, base calling, read
alignment, and variant calling. This automated and streamlined data analysis workflow performs
annotation and mutation identification on FASTQ, SFF, BAM, and VCF output files. Variant call format
(VCF) files were filtered to remove unusually poor-quality or low-coverage reads. All variants retained in
the analysis had quality ≥ 30 and coverage ≥ 10. Variant files were annotated using the VEP version 100
and referencing the GRCh37/hg19 build within dbSNP, the NCBI database of genetic variation.
Predicted LOF variants were annotated using LOFTEE10 and the analysis was restricted to the 13 genes
tested in Zhang et al. Rare variants (minor allele frequency < 1%) annotated as high confidence for LOF by
LOFTEE and passed quality control filters were extracted for the main analysis. We scanned for these
variants in our entire cohort of control negative, asymptomatic/mild and severe Saudi Arabian COVID-19
patients, and surprisingly, none were present in any patient.

Qatar Genome Program COVID-19 Cohort:
The Qatar Genome Program (QGP) is a population-based project launched by the Qatar Foundation to
generate a large whole genome sequence (WGS) dataset, in combination with comprehensive phenotypic
information collected by the Qatar Biobank. In this retrospective cohort consisting of 14,060 WGS
samples, we extracted information from electronic medical records (EMR) on the participants that were
tested positive. The extraction covered the period from early March till early September. There were a
total of 700 COVID-19 positive cases, including 60 severe cases with hypoxia that required ventilatory
support (BiPAP, high flow oxygen, or endotracheal intubation) and 640 classified as asymptomatic or mild
cases without any evidence of pneumonia or hypoxia. The severe COVID-19 cohort consisted of 30 male
and 30 female patients that were hospitalized for respiratory failure. Of the mild COVID-19 cases, 290

were male and 350 were female. The median age was 38 (range 18-89) for the severe and 37 (range 1889) for the mild group. All samples used for the analysis were of Qatari Middle Eastern Arabian ancestry.
After removal of related individuals, 23 severe and 231 mild cases remained. The severe COVID-19 cohort
consisted of 13 males and 10 females with a median age of 55 (range 28-68). 116 of the mild COVID-19
cohort were male, 115 female with a median age of 37 range (18-79).
All samples were sequenced on Illumina Hiseq X instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to a minimum
average coverage of 30x. Quality control of Fastq files was performed using FastQC (v0.11.2). The
secondary analyses (read mapping and joint variant calling) were performed using Sentieon’s DNASeq
pipeline25 v201808.03 (Sentieon, San Jose, CA, USA), following the GATK 3.8 best practices6,7. Reads were
aligned to GRCh38/hg38 reference genome. Quality control analyses included removal of samples with a
low genotyping call rate (less than 95%), gender discordance, excess heterozygosity and PCA-based
population outliers. We then used KING16 for the detection of related individuals and removed one of each
pair that had an inferred relationship of second-degree or closer. Consequently, 5,385 unrelated samples
were retained for our analysis. The remaining variants were annotated using VEP (release 99), with LOFTEE
and dbNSFP plugins. We then performed a gene set-based collapsing analysis, using the same criteria as
described for the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank Cohort (pLOF with internal & external MAF <
0.1%).

Ethics statement:
The recruitment and sequencing of participants from the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank were
approved by the Columbia University IRB, protocol number AAAS7370. The genetic analyses were
approved by the Columbia University IRB, under protocol number AAAS7948. The BQC-19 received ethical
approval for its activities from its multicentric ethics board headed at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université
de Montréal. Recruitment of patients at the Jewish General Hospital (JGH) was also approved by the JGH
ethics board. The Saudi Arabia COVID-19 Biobank study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles of the National Bioethical committee at KACST and approved by the Institutional Review Board
Committee at King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre, Ministry of National Guard-Health
Affairs, Riyadh, Ministry of Health, and King Fahad Medical City. The Institutional Review Boards of all
participating hospitals also approved the study. The recruitment and sequencing of participants from the
Qatar Biobank (QBB) were approved by the Hamad Medical Corporation Ethics Committee in 2011 and
continued with QBB Institutional Review Board (IRB) from 2017 onwards. It is renewed on an annual basis,

Figure 1. Power curves for a gene set based collapsing test: Power calculations for the Columbia COVID19 Biobank cohort of 480 severe COVID-19 cases and 9,589 population controls were performed using
the samplesizeCMH R package (version 0.0.0) for a dominant model at alpha=0.05 and a range of odds
ratios (OR). Results are shown for the pLOF and model including pLOFs and missense model. Since
power is influenced by the carrier frequency, we have adequate power to detect effect sizes as small as
1.5 for the model including missense variants compared to 5.5 for the rare pLOF variants only model.
