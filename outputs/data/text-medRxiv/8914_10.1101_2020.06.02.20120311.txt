Abstract
There are concerns that both the experience of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic
and worries about experiencing adversities will have substantial and lasting effects on mental
health. One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may
impact health is through effects on sleep. We used data from 48,723 UK adults in the
COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the
association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity
including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss
of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to
personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all timeinvariant confounders. Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of
adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was
associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while
each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of
poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and
experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to
employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on
associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by social or psychiatric
factors. Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental
health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies
during the pandemic.

Background
The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is leading to increasing
experience of adversities. These adversities are both arising from the virus itself (i.e.
infection, illness, and possibly death from the disease) and resulting from efforts to contain
the disease, such as financial shocks following the loss of employment and income,
challenges in accessing food, medication or accommodation, and adverse domestic
experiences such as abuse
8–15

1–7

. Similar experiences have been reported in previous epidemics

, but the scale of measures implemented and the long time-frames being projected for the

COVID-19 pandemic are causing concern that we face manifold public health crises in the
years to come 2,16,17.
In particular, there are concerns that adversity experiences will have substantial and lasting
17,18

effects on physical and mental health

. Studies suggest that intimate partner violence

19

and socio-economic adversities such as poverty20, job loss21, economic recession 22,23, and job
insecurity24, have lasting impacts on mortality and physical and mental health outcomes.
Further, it is not just the experience of these stressors, but also worries about the potential
experience of these stressors that can affect mental health, increasing levels of stress and
affecting depression and wellbeing

25,26

, as well as affecting physical health such as

cardiovascular outcomes 27. This relationship between worries and experiences of adversities
and mental health is already being demonstrated in studies during COVID-19 28.
One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact
health is through effects on sleep

29

. Both worries about adversities and experience of

adversities are types of stressors 30. The stress of experiencing adversities has been shown to
impair sleep

31–33

, while the stress of worrying about life events has been associated with

shorter sleep length and greater sleep disturbance

34,35

. Numerous biological studies have

focused on the pathways underlying these effects, including disruption of HPA axis activity
and increased cortisol production, and bidirectional changes between hormonal variation and
circadian rhythm 36,37A. I Inadequate sleep may reinforce the impact of stressors by reducing
individual’s ability to respond effectively, leading to a maladaptive psychophysiological
cycle

38–41

. Impaired sleep is in turn related to worsened physical health outcomes, such as

cardiovascular disease, weight gain, and mortality 42,43, and mental health outcomes, such as
anxiety and depression

44

. It is therefore essential to understand whether experience of

worries about adversities during the COVID-19 are leading to sleep problems.
While adversity may be related to poorer sleep quality on average, there are several factors
that could protect against such effects. First, social support may buffer against stress through
the provision of informational or tangible assistance or emotional support 45. A large body of
literature shows that social support is associated with better sleep

46

physical and mental health outcomes, including lower mortality rates

47

and with improved
. Further, improved

sleep has been identified as a pathway through which social support may affect health

48

.

However, decreased face-to-face contact and the increasing prevalence of adversity
throughout populations may have reduced the availability and quality of social support during
the pandemic 7. Further, the novel nature of several adversities faced may have reduced the
efficacy of informational or tangible assistance aspects of social support. Therefore, an
unresolved question is whether social support buffers the association between adversity and
sleep quality during lockdown.
A second factor that may be important for the link between adversity and sleep is existing
mental health. Studies show that individuals with pre-existing mental health issues may be
disproportionately affected psychologically by stressful events. For example, anxiety and
depression can predispose individuals (especially men) to greater stress reactivity

49

, while

anxiety sensitivity can moderate the relationship between exposure to traumatic events and

post-traumatic stress

50

. Further, in previous studies of epidemics, there has been some

indication that pre-existing psychiatric conditions are a risk factor for poorer psychological
outcomes 8. However, when considering the link between psychological experiences and
sleep, it is possible that individuals with existing mental health conditions may already have
poorer sleep, leading to a ceiling effect, such that adversity may not have any further material
detrimental effect on sleep 38,51,52.
To explore these issues further, the present study used data from a large, longitudinal study of
the experiences of adults during the early weeks of the lockdown due to COVID-19 in the
UK to explore the time-varying longitudinal relationship between (i) worries about adversity,
and (ii) experience of adversity and quality of sleep. Further, it sought to ascertain whether
the relationship between adversity and sleep quality was moderated by social support and
existing mental health diagnoses.

Materials and Methods
Participants
We use data from the COVID-19 Social Study; a large panel study of the psychological and
social experiences of over 50,000 adults (aged 18+) in the UK during the COVID-19
pandemic. The study commenced on 21 March 2020 and involves online weekly data
collection from participants for the duration of the pandemic in the UK. Recruitment into the
study is ongoing. The study is not random but does contain a well-stratified sample.
Participants were recruited using three primary approaches. First, snowballing was used,
including promoting the study through existing networks and mailing lists (including large
databases of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research across the
UK), print and digital media coverage, and social media. Second, more targeted recruitment
was undertaken focusing on (i) individuals from a low-income background, (ii) individuals

with no or few educational qualifications, and (iii) individuals who were unemployed. Third,
the study was promoted via partnerships with third sector organisations to vulnerable groups,
including adults with pre-existing mental health conditions, older adults, carers, and people
experiencing domestic violence or abuse. The study was approved by the UCL Research
Ethics Committee [12467/005] and all participants gave informed consent. The study
protocol and user guide (which includes full details on recruitment, retention, data cleaning,
weighting and sample demographics) are available at www.covidsocialstudy.org
Our questions asked about experiences of adversity in the last week, so we focused on data
from 1st April 2020 (one week after lockdown commenced) to 12th May 2020, limiting our
analysis to participants who were interviewed on two or more occasions during this period (n
= 48,723, observations = 208,057; 80.2% of individuals interviewed between 1 April – 12
May). We used complete case data and excludedparticipants with complete data in fewer than
two interviews (n = 2,439; 5% of eligible participants). This provided a final analytical
sample of 46,284 participants (197,372 observations).

Measures
Adversities
We study six categories of adversity, each measured weekly (see Table 1). We constructed
weekly total adversity worries and total adversity experiences measures by summing the
number of adversities present in a given week (range 0-6). We considered worries to be oneoff events and counted them only in the weeks they were reported. For adversities that are
likely to be continuing (i.e. once experienced in one week, their effects would likely last into
future weeks), we counted them on subsequent waves after they had first occurred. This
applied to experiencing suspected/diagnosed COVID-19, loss of paid work, major cut in
household income, and abuse victimisation.

Sleep
Sleep quality was elicited using a single item on sleep: “Over the past week, how has your
sleep been?” with five response categories: very good, good, average, not good, very poor.
To distinguish between minor variations in individual reporting and focus instead on levels of
poor sleep quality that are likely to have larger consequences for health, we dichotomised this
into a binary variable for not good or poor vs average or better sleep.
Social Support
We measured social support at first interview using four separate variables for loneliness,
perceived social support, social network size, and living alone. Loneliness was measured
using the 3-item UCLA-3 loneliness, a short form of the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale
(UCLA-R). Each item is rated with a 3-point rating scale, ranging from “never” to “often”,
with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. We used the sum score measure (range 3-9).
Perceived social support was measured using an adapted version of the six-item short form of
Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU K-6). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale
from “not true at all” to “very true”, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived
social support. We used the sum score measure (range 6-30). Minor adaptations were made to
the language in the scale to make it relevant to experiences during COVID-19 (see
Supplementary Table S1 for a comparison of changes). Social network size was measured as
number of close friends, with numbers capped at 10+. We included this as a continuous
variable.
Psychiatric Illness
We defined psychiatric illness as reporting a clinically diagnosed mental health problem
(“clinically-diagnosed depression”, “clinically-diagnosed anxiety”, or “another clinicallydiagnosed mental health problem”) at first interview.

Analysis
We used random-effect within-between (REWB) models 53 (also known as hybrid models 54)
to explore the association between within-person change in adversity experiences and
adversity worries and the likelihood of poor quality sleep

there was any initial association with sleep, and then re-ran the models with both sets of

association between within-person change in adversity experiences and adversity worries and
the likelihood of poor sleep. We focused on within-person change rather than cross-sectional
variation as cross-sectional associations are likely to be confounded by factors such as socioeconomic class or personality, which are related to the prevalence of adversity and to sleep.
When looking at within-person changes, these characteristics should be fixed, and so

associations should not be biased due the influence of these omitted variables on sleep. In
fact, in non-linear models such as the logistic model, the coefficients ଵ and ଷ are unbiased
by time-invariant heterogeneity if the random intercept, ௜ , is a linear function of the level-2
predictors. However, simulations have shown that the extent of bias due to violations of this
assumption are limited in practice 53. Nevertheless, results can still be biased if exposure to
new adversities or worries is related to other unobserved changes occurring for the individual.
We estimated several models. In Model 1, we regressed sleep quality on the total number of
adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries, both (a) separately and (b)
jointly, using the fixed effects estimator to account for time-invariant heterogeneity across
participants. (Variance Inflation Factors suggest multicollinearity was not a problem in this
model.) In Model 2, we regressed sleep quality on adversity experiences and adversity
worries separately for each category of adversity in turn (finances, personal safety, etc.). In
Model 3, we repeated Model 1a including interactions between adversity measures and each
social support variable, for each social support variable in turn. In Model 4, we repeated
Model 1a including interactions between adversity measures and baseline mental health. We
adjusted for day of week (categorical) and days since lockdown commenced (continuous) in
each regression (person-specific means and deviations from these means). To account for the
non-random nature of the sample, all data were weighted to the proportions of gender, age,

ethnicity, education and country of living obtained from the Office for National Statistics 55.
We carried out several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. First, we reestimated Model 3 using inability to pay bills, rather than major cut in household income, as
our measure of experienced financial adversity to differentiate between a change in wealth
and a change in wealth that impacts on core financial activity. Second, we repeated each
analysis using the sleep item as a continuous variable to test whether results were robust to
variable measurement. For these regressions, we used the linear fixed effects estimator which

controls for time-invariant confounding by design. Third, we repeated regressions using both
the linear probability fixed effect estimator and the fixed effects logit estimators. We did not
use the fixed effects logit estimator in the main analysis as the estimator uses information
from those whose sleep quality changes only, which may bias results towards those whose
sleep is most responsive to adversity. Fourth, we repeated our main REWB model for the
subset of individuals whose sleep quality changed and compared results against those from
the fixed effect logit estimator to assess the possibility of confounding due to time invariant
heterogeneity in our main analysis. Analyses were carried out in Stata version 16.0
(Statacorp, Texas) and R version 3.6.3.

Results
Demographics
Descriptive statistics for the exposures and outcomes are shown in Error! Reference source
not found.2. There was within-variation in each of the measures, suggesting REWB was a
valid approach. Tables S2 and S3 in the supplementary material displays descriptive statistics
for baseline demographic, social support and mental health diagnosis variables. The weighted
sample was 51.3% female, 9.6% from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds, and 19.0% of
the sample were aged 18-34, 24.8% aged 35-49, 31.4% aged 50-64 and 24.8% aged 65 and
above. Individuals with diagnosed mental illness or with lower social support had worse
sleep, on average. Table S4 in the supplementary information displays the sample size by
week of interview. Attrition was less than 10% each week.

Associations between adversities and sleep
Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were
associated with lower quality sleep (Error! Reference source not found.). The inclusion of

experiences and worries in the same model slightly reduced the effect size of experiences and
had little effect on the effect size of worries. In models including both experiences and
worries, each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times
higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20
(95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep.
[FIGURE 1 HERE]
When considering specific experiences and worries, worries were significantly related to
poorer quality sleep in every category of adversity (Figure 2). There was some heterogeneity
in effect sizes, with the largest effects found for worries about personal safety (OR = 1.43
[1.35, 1.53]), followed by access to medication (OR=1.39 [1.30, 1.49]), employment
(OR=1.25 [1.16, 1.35]), access to food (OR=1.24 [1.17, 1.32]), finances (OR=1.19 [1.12,
1.26]), and catching COVID-19 (OR=1.18 [1.12, 1.25]).
For experiences, the largest effects were found for access to medication (OR=1.42 [1.25,
1.61]) and difficulty in accessing food (OR=1.31 [1.17, 1.47]). Experiencing adversities
relating to personal safety such as abuse were also related to poor quality sleep (OR=1.29
[1.14, 1.47]), as was catching COVID-19 (OR=1.30 [1.08, 1.54]) (although the confidence
intervals were wide potentially indicating heterogeneity in responses). There was some
evidence of a relationship between losing work and poor sleep (OR= 1.14 [0.95, 1.38]), but
no evidence of a relationship with experiencing a cut in income (OR = 0.95 [0.84, 1.07]).

[FIGURE 2 HERE]

Moderators
There was little clear evidence that social support moderated the relationship between sleep
quality and adversity experiences (Figure 3; see Table S5 in the supplementary information
for interaction term coefficients). For adversity worries (Figure 3), there was evidence that
the association between poor quality sleep and adversity worries was weaker among those
with more close friends (OR = 0.97 [0.957, 0.99]). But for other measures, such as loneliness,
associations were more tentative (Table S3).
There was also no evidence of differences in the relationship between worries and sleep
quality in people with and without a diagnosed mental illness (Figure 4). There was limited
evidence of moderation by mental health for adversity experiences, with larger effects found
among those with diagnosed psychiatric conditions (OR = 1.10 [0.99, 1.24]).

[FIGURE 3 HERE]

[FIGURE 4 HERE]

Sensitivity Analysis
The results from sensitivity analyses are displayed in the Supplementary Information. Point
estimates suggest that inability to pay bills was more highly related to poor sleep quality than
reporting a major cut in household income (Figure S1).
Results using the fixed effects linear probability estimator were qualitatively similar to those
from REWB models (Figures S2-S5). An increase in adversity experiences or adversity

worries was association with a ~2% point increase in the probability of poor sleep (Figure
S2). Results using the fixed effects logit estimator, which, as noted above, only uses data
from those whose sleep quality changed, were also qualitatively similar to those from REWB
models, but produced stronger effect sizes (Figures S6-S9). An increase in adversity
experiences or adversity worries was association with a ~ 4-5% point increase in the
probability of poor sleep (Figure S6). Moderation analyses produced similar effect sizes to
those from REWB models (Figures S8-S9 and Table S3). When limiting analyses to
individuals whose sleep quality changed, similar results were produced by the REWB and
fixed effects logit estimators (Figure S10), suggesting our main results are not biased due to
time invariant heterogeneity.
When analysing sleep quality as a continuous measure, the main findings were qualitatively
also similar, with both experiences and worries related to poorer sleep (Figure S11-14).
However, there was no clear evidence of a moderating role of social support in the
association between adversities experiences or worries and sleep (Figure S13). There was still
a moderating role of mental health in the association between adversity experiences and sleep
quality (Figure S14 and Table S3).

Discussion
In this study, we explored the relationship between worries and experience of adversities and
quality of sleep during lockdown due to COVID-19. Cumulative number of worries and
experience of adversities were both related to lower quality sleep. When considering specific
types of adversities, all types of worries explored were associated with poorer sleep quality,
while only specific experiences such as abuse, inabilities to pay bills, access food or
medication, and catching COVID-19 showed clear associations with poorer sleep. Effects
sizes were small: additional adversity experience or worries were related to approximately a

2% point higher likelihood of poor quality sleep, on average. Having more close friends
helped to moderate the relationship between worries and sleep but there was weaker evidence
that other social factors had any clear protective buffering effects.
This study supports findings from emerging research on COVID-19, which has suggested
that sleep is being adversely affected amongst people during the pandemic

56

. The clear

relationship between both specific and cumulative worries and poor sleep echoes findings
about the adverse effects of stress on sleep from a number of previous studies 31–33. However,
it is notable that only specific experiences were related to poor sleep. These related
specifically to difficulties in accessing food and medication, experience of abuse, and
contracting COVID-19. In particular, experience of domestic violence has previously been
well-researched in relation to sleep, with studies notably suggesting that fear of future abuse
and nightmares can disrupt sleep

57

. There has also been increasing research focus on the

neuropsychiatric effects of coronavirus infections, with suggestions that sleep disturbance can
follow from infection

58

, which could explain the findings showing a relationship between

having COVID-19 and impaired sleep. However, notably we didn’t find a clear relationship
between experiencing loss of work or cuts in household income and impaired sleep, although
worry about these things was associated with poorer sleep. It is possible that consequences
may take time to arise. For instance, loss of paid work or cuts in income may impact sleep
only following repeated rejections during job search or when reduced incomes begin to
impact living standards

59,60

. Financial adversities may also have been anticipated such that

effects were felt in anticipation of the financial adversities, and high strain work may itself
have adversely impacted sleep

33

. The effect of job loss on stress may also have been

counterbalanced by increased leisure time 61.
Our results also found only limited evidence of buffering of these associations by social
factors. Having more close friends appeared to buffer the association between stressors and

sleep. This aligns with previous research on social support as a moderator of the relationship
between occupational stress and sleep 62, but is notable given that social contact with friends
was not permitted limited during the period followed due to lockdowns. This suggests that
potentially knowing that one has a circle of friends provides reassurance even if their support
is not explicitly drawn on. However, for other social factors there was only limited evidence
of any moderating effect. It is possible that decreased social interaction or limited face-toface contact with social networks may have reduced any protective effects 7. Further, it is
interesting that there was only limited evidence of moderation by mental illness. Anxiety and
depression can predispose individuals to greater stress reactivity 49, and our results suggested
there could be slightly larger effects amongst those diagnosed psychiatric conditions. But
results were not clear, and both those with and without psychiatric conditions are at risk of
poor sleep as a result of adversities. This echoes other research showing how adversities and
stresses are affecting not just those at high risk but broad populations 7.
This study has a number of strengths including its large, well-stratified sample, which was
weighted to population proportions for core socio-demographic characteristics. Further, the
study collected data covering the entire period from the start of lockdown in the UK on a
weekly basis, providing an extremely rich dataset with longitudinal data. This data allowed us
to estimate the relationship between adversity and change in sleep within individuals, rather
than rely on cross-sectional variation, which would likely be confounded by time-invariant
heterogeneity across individuals. However, the study has several limitations. First, we are
unable to confirm causality. Whilst is appears logical that poor sleep itself cannot cause
adverse experiences, there is likely a bidirectional relationship between worries and poor
sleep, and worries may pre-date experiences. But our analyses suggest that both worries and
experiences are independently associated with poor sleep. Additionally, we used a single item
five-category self-report measure of sleep quality, which did not provide detail on which

aspect of sleep was most affected (e.g. duration, onset, interruption etc) and may have lacked
sufficient variation and validity to accurately estimate effects. Indeed, self-reports of sleep
have been found to be worse in psychiatric patients, which may also have biased responses 63.
However, single item sleep scales have been shown to possess favourable measurement
characteristics to lengthier sleep questionnaires and are widely used in research

64

. It is

possible that individuals experiencing worries or adversities may have perceived their sleep
to be worse, but without substantial variation in the core qualitative parameters of sleep.
Further, our sampling was not random. Although we deliberately sampled from groups such
as individuals of low socio-economic position and individuals with existing mental illness, it
is possible that more extreme experiences were not adequately captured in the study. It is also
possible that individual experiencing particularly extreme situations during the lockdown
withdrew from the study. While our statistical method means their data is still included, we
would lack longitudinal follow-up on their changing experiences. Social support was
measured at first interview, which for many was after lockdown began. Responses to these
questions could have been affected by adversities experienced already. We also focused on
just six types of adversities, including those relating to health, safety, finances and basic
needs. However, many other types of adversity were not included in the study, including
those relating to interpersonal relationships, displacement, and bereavement. Finally, our
study only followed individuals up over a period of weeks. It remains for future studies to
assess how experience of adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic relates to sleep – and to
health – long-term.
Previous studies have shown that experience and worries about adversities during COVID-19
are associated with poorer mental health. The results presented heresuggest that poor sleep
may be a mechanism by which such adversities are affecting mental health. Worries about
adversities were related to poorer quality sleep over time, as was cumulative load of adverse

experiences was also associated with poorer quality sleep. But only specific adversities such
as those relating to personal safety, catching COVID-19, or challenges in accessing food and
medication showed clear associations with poor sleep on their own. These results were
relatively consistent amongst those with and without a diagnosed mental illness. Having a
larger social network had some protective effects, but other social factors had more limited
moderating effects on the relationship. These results may be generalisable to non-pandemic
settings, showing how two different types of stressors (experiences and worries) are similarly
related to sleep. Further, many of the measures of stressors we focused on (including both the
worries about and experiences of adversities) can be experienced in daily life. However, the
results also have an immediate relevance to supporting individuals during the current
pandemic. They suggest the importance of interventions that seek to reassure individuals and
enable adaptive coping strategies. Given the challenges in providing mental health support to
individuals during the lockdown, these findings highlight the importance of developing
online and remote interventions that could provide such support, both as COVID-19
continues and in preparation for future pandemics.
