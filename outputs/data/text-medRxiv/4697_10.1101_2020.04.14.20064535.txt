Abstract
Rapid and accurate tests that detect IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
proteins are essential in slowing the spread of COVID-19 by identifying
patients who are infected with COVID-19. Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome
microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and
IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or
non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the
SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis

because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will
have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein
subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for
IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD)
would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably,
the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3%
COVID-19 patients, respectively. Finally, the COVID-19-specific antibodies are
significantly correlated with the clinical indices of viral infection and acute
myocardial injury (pâ‰¤0.05). Our data may help understand the function of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improve serology tests for rapid COVID-19
screening.

Text
Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a
worldwide pandemic. As of April 14, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 185
countries with 1,929,922 confirmed cases and 120,450 deaths. COVID-19
symptoms range from a mild cough to pneumonia, and it is estimated that
~17.9% of patients have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all (1-4). This
subgroup of patients, although contagious, would not be selected for viral RNA
testing and quarantined. However, diagnostic testing is critical to effective
containment of SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus responsible for COVID-19 (5).
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are produced within the first week of infection (6,

7). Thus, tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum, plasma, and whole
blood have been developed to rapidly screen patients to ascertain infection
status and possibly immunity to COVID-19 (8). Current rapid antibody tests
from different manufacturers rely on antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid (N) protein, spike (S) protein, or S protein fragments (i.e., subunit
1, S1; receptor binding domain, RBD). Both N and S proteins are structural
proteins. Some manufacturers even use a combination of the N and S proteins
and protein fragments, thus resulting in varying or inconsistent antibody tests
(8, 9). The SARS-CoV-2 genome also encodes a polyprotein (the open reading
frame 1a and 1b, Orf1ab), two additional structural proteins (envelope, E;
membrane, M) and five accessary proteins (Orf3a, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf8,
Orf10)(10). The development of a rapid in vitro diagnostic serology test with
high sensitivity and specificity relies on selecting the antigens with high
immunogenicity. Furthermore, it important to consider the homology of the
antigen with proteins from other viruses to decrease the number of false
negative results (8, 11).
In this study, we used a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in
our laboratory to perform a proteome-wide analysis of differential antibody
responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the serum of 40 patients displaying
similar symptoms (i.e., fever, cough or muscle ache) with COVID-19, influenza,
or non-influenza (Figure 1a, Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1)(12). The
early-stage COVID-19 patients {Onset of symptoms, 4.0 (1.0-20.0) days} were

diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Management Plan of Pneumonia
with New Coronavirus Infection (trial version 7). The non-influenza controls are
the patients with similar symptoms as COVID-19, but excluded the infection of
respiratory virus (Table 1).
The SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray contained full-length N protein,
full-length E protein, five S truncated proteins and 966 tiled peptides
representing the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Supplementary Table 1). Each
peptide was 15 amino acids long with a 5 amino acid overlap. The intra- and
inter-array correlation of serum IgM and IgG antibody detection were 0.9916 to
0.9992,

respectively,

of

SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray (Supplementary Figure 2). Using the
microarray, we analyzed the serum of 15 COVID-19 confirmed patients, 13
influenza patients and 12 non-influenza patients, which generated a total of
77,840 antibody-antigen reactions that were screened.
First, we analyzed the elevated antibodies in early-stage COVID-19
patients compared to the influenza and non-influenza patients (Supplementary
Figure 1). A comparison of the COVID-19 and non-influenza patient groups
identified 76 IgM antigens and 17 IgG antigens that were differentially targeted
(Supplementary Figure 3). The IgM antigens included the S protein (26
peptides, S1, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD, S2ECD), N protein (1 peptide, full-length
protein), M protein (2 peptides), E protein (3 peptides, full-length protein),
Orf1ab (10 peptides), Orf3a (18 peptides), Orf6 (5 peptides), Orf8 (1 peptide),

and Orf10 (3 peptides). The IgG antigens included the S protein (5 peptides,
S1, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD, S2ECD), N protein (2 peptides, full-length protein), E
protein (1 peptides), and Orf1ab (4 peptides). A comparison of the COVID-19
and influenza groups identified 86 IgM antigens and 64 IgG antigens
(Supplementary Figure 4). The IgM antigens included the S protein (67
peptides, S1, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD, S2ECD), N protein (2 peptides), M protein
(2 peptides), and Orf1ab (10 peptides). The IgG antigens included the S
protein (10 peptides, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD, S2ECD), N protein (2 peptides,
full-length protein), and Orf1ab (48 peptides) (Supplementary Table 2).
A Venn diagram analysis indicates that 27 IgM antigens and 9 IgG
antigens were unique to COVID-19 compared to both influenza and
non-influenza groups (Supplementary Figure 5). All of the IgM antigens were
from the S protein (22 peptides, S1, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD, S2ECD). The IgG
antigens were from the S protein (2 peptides, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD, S2ECD), N
protein (2 peptides, full-length protein) and Orf1ab (1 peptide) (Supplementary
Table 2). These results suggest that, during the early stage of COVID-19
infection, IgM antibodies targeting the S protein are produced. The IgG
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which are produced later during COVID-19
infection, bind to the S, N and Orf1ab proteins. These results make sense
because the S protein is displayed across the virion surface, which is easily
accessible to the humoral immune system. The N and Orf1ab proteins, on the
other hand, is usually compartmentalized within the viral particle. As the virus

replicates within the host cells, the N and Orf1ab proteins could be released
from the cells and later recognized by the humoral immune system(13).
Hierarchical cluster analyses show that 86.7 % (13/15) and 73.3% (11/15)
of COVID-19 patients can be distinguished from influenza and non-influenza
patients by measuring these differentially-expressed IgM and IgG antibodies,
respectively (Figure 1b). These numbers are superior to the current serological
antibody tests using Immunocolloidal Gold lateral flow, ELISA and
Chemiluminescence technologies, which have positive rates (%) ranging from
7% to 53% from the same serum samples (Supplementary Figure 6). These
results indicate the potential of our SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray in
identifying appropriate antibody biomarkers for early COVID-19 diagnosis.
In order to know which SARS-CoV-2 proteins are suitable for developing a
diagnostic test, we compared the IgM and IgG antibodies of COVID-19,
influenza, and non-influenza patients in regards to how they targeted two
structural proteins, N and S (N, S1, S1RBD, S1+S2ECD and S2ECD). It is
surprising that the N protein IgM antibodies cannot discriminate between
COVID-19 and the other influenza and non-influenza patients. Instead, IgM
antibodies targeting S1-RBD and S1+S2ECD could best discriminate
COVID-19 patients from the other groups with a p-value less than 0.01
(COVID-19 vs. influenza) and 0.001 (COVID-19 vs. non-influenza) (Figure 2a).
These results were validated using a peptide microarray, in which four
antibody binding epitopes on the S protein subunit 2 (S2) were identified (Table

trimerized S protein indicate that four epitopes are located within the
extracellular domain of subunit 2 (S2ECD, Ser686-Pro1213). These epitopes
included

NVLYENQ), residues 956-970 (AQALNTLVKQLSSNF), residues 1096-1100
(VSNGT), and residues 996-1000 (LITGR) (Figure 3a).
The concentration of IgG antibodies to N, S, S1+S2ECD, S1-RBD, and
S2ECD proteins was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than the other
groups, with S2ECD having the best discriminative performance. The results
were also validated using a peptide microarray, in which four peptides from N,
S, and Orf1ab proteins were identified as the antibody binding epitopes (Table
2, Supplementary Table 2). Sequential alignment and structural analysis
indicate that two epitopes on the S protein (residues 816-820, SFIED; residues
886-890, WTFGA) are located on the surface and inside of the S protein,
respectively (Figure 3b). Notably, the one epitope (residues 86-100,
YYRRATRRIRGGDGK) on the N protein is located within the RNA binding
domain loop that is easily accessible to antibodies. These results suggest that
using the appropriate control groups (e.g., non-COVID-19 patients with similar

symptoms) is critical in selecting antibody biomarkers for an antibody-based
diagnostic test (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).
The N protein is not an ideal antigen for the diagnostic test at early
SARS-CoV-2 infection because the IgM antibodies that target this protein
could not discriminate between the COVID-19 patients from the influenza
patients (Figure 2a). The sensitivity of IgG antibodies for N protein is also low
and only 30% (5/15) early COVID-19 patients can be discriminated (Figure 2b).
The finding can be confirmed by a meta-analysis of 7848 individuals, in which
the sensitivity of S antigen-based tests is superior to that of N antigen-based
tests (14, 15). The S1-RBD and S1+S2ECD proteins might be the optimal
antigens for the IgM antibody test, whereas the S2ECD protein might be the
optimal antigen for the IgG antibody test (Figure 2). Furthermore, the
combination of different biomarkers could increase the testâ€™s sensitivity
compared to using a single biomarker alone by distinguishing 86.7 % (13/15)
and 73.3% (11/15) COVID-19 patients from the influenza and non-influenza
patients (Figure 1b). Identification of multiple biomarkers or peptide epitopes
with high immunogenicity is possible with our SARS-CoV-2 proteome array.
Finally, we performed a comprehensive circos correlation analysis of
COVID-19 specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 20 clinical indices. Statistically
significant correlations (pâ‰¤0.05) are indicated in pink (Figure 4, Supplementary
Table 3). The IgM antibodies to the S protein significantly correlated with
eosinophil count (EOS#), hemoglobin (HGB), platelet count (PLT), albumin

(Alb), creatine kinase MB mass (CKMB-mass) and N-terminal pro-brain
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. On the other hand, the IgG antibodies
to the S protein significantly correlated with lymphocyte count and percentage
(LY# and LY%), CKMB-mass and NT-proBNP levels. Notably, the levels of two
biomarkers of cardiac injury, NT-proBNP and CKMB-mass, were significantly
correlated with both IgM and IgG COVID-19 specific antibodies (Figure 4),
suggesting that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies contribute to acute myocardial
injury(16).
A limitation of this study is that antibodies binding to conformational
epitopes or post translational modifications could not be detected using our
microarray comprised of chemically-synthesized, linear peptides (17). In
addition, a small number of patients were employed. These results should be
validated using a large patient cohort with other respiratory infections(16).
Our work provides valuable information to help fight COVID-19.
Understanding the humoral immune response to COVID-19 will help us
understand the role of antibodies in COVID-19, identify potential targets for
immunotherapy, and enable the production of accurate rapid serology tests for
COVID-19 detection. Detection of IgM antibodies will help identify those with
acute COVID-19 infection who need to be quarantined. Detection of IgG
antibodies may help identify those who are recovering from or have gained
immunity to COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 proteins using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray. (a) The
workflow of proteome-wide analysis of differential antibody response to
SARS-CoV-2 proteins using a proteome microarray. (b) Hierarchical clustering
analysis of differential antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteome between
patients with COVID-19, influenza, and non-influenza displaying similar
symptoms. The false-colored rainbow color from blue to red correspond to low
to high signal intensities on the array, respectively.
Figure 2. Box plot analysis of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2
structural N and S proteins between confirmed and suspected COVID-19
patients. The statistical significance was calculated using Mann Whitney
U-test with a p-value less than 0.05. The one, two and three asterisks
represent the p-value of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively.

CKMBmass, respectively. The COVID-19 antibodies were selected with a
Spearman coefficient correlation higher than 0.6 and a p-value less than 0.05.

Methods
Collection of clinical samples
Patients with COVID-19, influenza or non-influenza with similar symptoms
were enrolled in the Outpatient department of Peking Union Medical College
Hospital. All serum samples were collected under the approval of the intuitional
review board (IRB) from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Ethical
number: ZS-2303) and Beijing Proteome Research Center. Written informed
consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease. All
experiments were performed according to the standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki. The COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms were diagnosed
according to the Diagnosis and Management Plan of Pneumonia with New
Coronavirus Infection (trial version 7).

Screening of serological antibodies in COVID-19 and suspected patients
using SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray
The SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarrays containing 966 peptides and
full-length N, full-length E and truncated S proteins were prepared as
described previously(12). Prior to antibody detection, the microarrays were
assembled in an incubation tray and blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in 1xPBS with

0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 min at room temperature. After washing
with PBST three times, the array was incubated with 1:100 diluted serum for
30 min at room temperature and washed again. The array was then incubated
for 30 min with a mixture containing Cy3 Affinipure donkey anti-human
IgG(H+L) and Alexa Fluor 647 Affinipure goat anti-human IgM FC5Âµ antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) (2Î¼g/mL). Finally, the resulting array was
washed with PBST and water, dissembled from the tray and dried with
centrifugation for 2 min at 2,000 rpm. The slide was scanned with a GenePix
4300A microarray scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at 532
and 635 nm to measure Cy3 and Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence, respectively.
Median spot intensity minus background was extracted using GenePix Pro7
software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Detection of serological antibody in early COVID-19 patients using
Immunocolloidal Gold Strip, ELISA and Chemiluminescence.
Serological antibodies in patients with COVID-19, influenza and non-influenza
suspected patients were analyzed using Immunocolloidal Gold Strip, ELISA
and Chemiluminescence according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions.

Statistical analysis
All microarray signals were normalized with a Z-score prior to statistical
analyses(18). Differentially-expressed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were identified

analysis of serological antibody response to peptides was performed using the
R pheatmap. The circos plot was made using circos (http://circos.ca/).
