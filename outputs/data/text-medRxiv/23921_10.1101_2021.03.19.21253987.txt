Abstract
This study is the first focused on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different freshwater environments in an urban
setting. Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of
the Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a SARS-CoV-2 peak phase between October
2020 and January 2021, and viral RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction. Forty-four percent of the groundwater samples had detectable viral loads between 2.6 and 38.3
copies/ml. A significant correlation between viral load and sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed
the hypothesis of leaching and infiltrating effluent from surface and/or failing sewage pipes and emphasized the
importance of water disinfection. Twelve percent of the surface water dam samples tested positive for viral RNA,
with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 13% of the river samples were positive for viral
RNA, with concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 7.0 copies/ml. Untreated wastewater samples taken in the same
period showed viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or wastewater facilities
efficiency of three orders of magnitude. Variations in the viral loads in the groundwater and surface water over
time and at the submetropolitan level generally reflected the reported trends in infection cases for Monterrey.
The viral loads in the freshwater environments of Monterrey represent a low risk for recreational activities
according to a preliminary risk assessment model. However, this result should not be taken lightly due to
uncertainty regarding data and model constraints and the possibility of situations where the infection risk may
increase considerably.

1. Introduction
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease, various routes of transmission of SARSCoV-2 have been verified and others have been hypothesized. Currently, the main
transmission is known to occur between people through respiratory droplets (diameter >5-10
µm) produced by infected individuals when coughing or sneezing. Another presumed way of
transmission is indirect contact with surfaces or objects in the immediate environment used
by the infected person or on the infected person (Chan et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; WHO, 2020).
An increasing number of studies have detected the presence of viral RNA in stool from
COVID-19 patients (Wang et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020). Based on stool
samples, Wu et al. (2020a) suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may replicate for 11 days in the
gastrointestinal tract of patients even after samples from the respiratory tract become negative.
According to another experiment, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for 2 to 6 h in adult feces
and up to 2 days in children’s feces (Liu 2020). This opens potential modes of fecal
transmission.
Regarding the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, there is sufficient
evidence that indicates that wastewaters may contain both RNA fragments and viable particles
of SARS-CoV-2 (Langone et al. 2020). Several studies have reported the new coronavirus in
untreated and treated wastewater in the USA (Wu et al., 2020b; Nemudryi et al., 2020;
Sherchan et al., 2020; Green et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020), Japan (Haramoto et al., 2020;
Hata et al., 2020), France (Wurtzer et al., 2020; Torttier et al., 2020), Italy (La Rosa et al.,
2020a; Rimoldi et al., 2020), Spain (Randazzo et al., 2020; Balboa et al., 2020), India (Kumar
et al., 2020; Chakraborty et al., 2021), Pakistan (Sharif et al., 2020; Yaqub et al., 2020),
Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020), Australia (Ahmed et al., 2020a), Turkey (Kocamemi et
al., 2020), Israel (Bar-Or et al., 2020), Germany (Westhaus et al., 2020), and Czech Republic
(Mlejnkova et al., 2020). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with tertiary disinfection
have been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Rimoldi et al., 2020), while effluents from
secondary treatments have been found to be positive (Randazzo et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al.,
2020). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage sludge was reported in a 10-week
monitoring study in New Haven, Connecticut, USA (Peccia et al., 2020).

Although several authors have hypothesized about potential routes in water
environments, to date, there exists little evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in
freshwater (La Rosa et al. 2020b; Langone et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021). Rimoldi et al.
(2020) detected viral RNA in three receiving rivers in the Milan area indicating the partial
efficiency of the sewage system in the metropolitan area. Haramoto et al. (2020) collected
three river samples between March and May 2020 in Japan and reported that no samples tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Guerrero-Latorre et al. (2020) reported viral loads during a
peak of the outbreak from three different sites of a river receiving untreated sewage from
Quito, Ecuador. To our knowledge, to date, no evidence of the presence of the virus in surface
water reservoirs and aquifers has been reported.
Water safety starts with the protection of water resources in catchment; therefore, it is
mandatory to prevent surface and groundwater from coming into contact with fecal material.
It is hypothesized that pathogen removal occurs in groundwater due to soil filtration,
adsorption on sediment grains and progressive inactivation, and viruses in surface waters are
exposed to several potentially inactivating stressors, including sunlight, oxidants, and
predation by microorganisms (Langone et al., 2021). An ongoing research question is how
persistent SARS-CoV-2 virus is in different water matrixes.
Chemical markers are indicators that may help evaluate the proper functioning of
WWTPs and determine the level of human wastewater effluent in groundwater systems. The
characteristics of an ideal wastewater indicator include: (i) source specificity, (ii) sustained
effluent release because the indicator is not rapidly degraded by biological treatment
processes, (iii) a demonstrated analytical methodology, (iv) no attenuation during transport,
and (v) virtually zero background with a sufficiently large discharge to detection level ratio
able to exceed receiving water dilution factors (Gasser et al., 2010; Oppenheimer et al., 2011).
Several anthropogenic organic compounds with known characteristics have been used as
chemical markers of pollutant loading due to their behavior as persistent aqueous organic
pollutants (Benotti et al., 2009; Buerge et al., 2009). Among them, sucralose is one of the most
popular artificial sweeteners and thus serves as a tracer of human wastewater, and its
concentration is correlated with people connected to the sewage system (Kokotou et al., 2012;
Voss et al., 2019). This organic compound is stable over a broad pH range and is heat stable,

nonvolatile, highly polar and chiral. It is also strongly recalcitrant, degrading only under
strongly oxidizing conditions, and is not metabolized by animals or microbes (Soh et al. 2011).
These characteristics makes sucralose an excellent marker for human wastewater effluents,
and it may help to confirm the presence of human pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.
In the present study, we evaluated the presence of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2
RNA in different freshwater environments in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (5.3 million
inhabitants) in northern Mexico. The aim of the study was to perform a survey of viral
dispersion and potential implications for the environment and public health during a peak
phase of the epidemic. To address this goal, we collected untreated groundwater, river water
and water from dams repeatedly between October 2020 and January 2021 and measured
SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). For the groundwater, the concentration of the artificial sweetener sucralose was
measured in parallel.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Study area
The Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) is the second most important city in Mexico
in terms of population and the economy. It comprises 12 municipalities with a total population
of approximately 5.3 million inhabitants (INEGI, 2021). The climate is semiarid with a mean
annual temperature and rainfall of 22.3°C and 622 mm, respectively, with a dry season
(November-April) and rainy season (May-October). The urban area is bordered to the west
and south by mountain ranges varying in composition from clastic marine to carbonate
sedimentary rocks reaching elevations up to 2100 m above sea level (masl) (Fig. 1).

Figure 1: (a) Location of the study area; (b) regional view showing surface-water
reservoirs with sampling points El Cuchillo (CU), Cerro Prieto (CP) and La Boca (BC) and
(c) the urban area with the main features and sampling points of the groundwater systems
Buenos Aires (BA), Santiago (SA) and Metropolitan zone (ZM), and urban rivers (R).

The MMA sits in a valley at 580 masl on Quaternary alluvial deposits eroded from the
surrounding mountain ranges. The valley is mostly composed of fluvial and alluvial
sedimentary deposits as terraces that occurred during accumulation-erosion cycles in the early
Quaternary (Martinez and Werner, 1997).
Water for the MMA is supplied from surface water (58%) and groundwater (42%)
reservoirs (SADM, 2021). Surface water is extracted from the El Cuchillo dam (4.69 m3/s),
Cerro Prieto dam (2.83 m3/s), and La Boca dam (0.45 m3/s). Water from the El Cuchillo dam
and Cerro Prieto dam is conveyed 108 km and 133 km to the MMA, respectively, while the
La Boca dam connects to the Cerro Prieto aqueduct (Fig. 1b). Raw water from all three dams
is purified before distribution throughout the city through two water-supply pipelines over 70
km in length each (Fig. 1c).

Groundwater is extracted from several aquifer units and wellfields and disinfected locally
before being introduced into the supply network (Torres-Martinez et al. 2020) (Fig. 1a): The
Buenos Aires (BA) well field (2.11 m3/s) located in a side valley close to the city consists of
La Huasteca horizontal filtrating gallery and 23 deep wells with water table depths between
20 and 120 m below the ground, extracting water from Early Cretaceous limestone formations;
the Santiago (SA) groundwater system (1.27 m3/s) consists of La Estanzuela spring and three
horizontal filtrating galleries; the Monterrey Metropolitan Zone (ZM) aquifer (1.08 m3/s)
includes wells throughout the metropolitan area, providing water from an unconfined aquifer
which consists of altered lutite, conglomerate, gravel, sand and clay, with an average depth to
groundwater of 20 m; finally, the Mina well field (1.20 m3/s) is located approximately 35 km
northwest of the MMA.
Used domestic water is over 90% treated by public wastewater facilities that include
primary and secondary stages in the treatment process. The most important wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) are Dulces Nombres (7.5 m3/s), Norte (4.0 m3/s), Noreste (1.9
m3/s) and Cadereyta (0.25 m3/s) (Fig. 1c). All the noted WWTPs discharge the treated water
directly or indirectly to the Pesquería River, except for the Cadereyta WWTP that discharges
treated wastewater into the Santa Catarina River. Both rivers are tributaries of the San Juan
River which in turn flows into the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande. The Pesquería and Santa Catarina
Rivers had discharges that decreased from 5.5 to 4.4 m3/s at the Pesquería hydrometric station
and from 5.6 to 2.5 m3/s at the Cadereyta hydrometric station between October 2020 and
December 2020, respectively (SMN, 2021).
2.2 Field methods
Groundwater and surface water grab samples were collected at different sites and on
different dates between October 2020 and January 2021. For the groundwater, 42 sites
corresponding to production wells of supplying aquifer units of Monterrey (BA well field, ST
system and ZM aquifer) were sampled initially between October 29 and November 3, 2020.
Of these wells, 37 wells were public drinking water supply wells and five wells were used for
industrial purposes. A subset of wells (n=10) was resampled two more times in cycles of
approximately one month to observe changes over time (Table 1).

Similarly, samples were obtained from three sites of three surface water reservoirs
supplying Monterrey (El Cuchillo, Cerro Prieto and La Boca) on October 22-23, 2020, and
sampling was repeated two more times. Finally, a total of 12 river water grab samples were
taken along the three urban rivers Pesquería, Santa Catarina and La Silla on December 1011,2020, and his process was repeated on January 5-6, 2021. The river sites were selected
strategically upstream and downstream of WWTP discharge into the rivers. For reference, 24h composite samples of influent of a Dulces Nombres WWTP were taken weekly during the
same period.
All samples were collected in sterile 125 ml HDPE bottles, stored at 4°C and analyzed
within 48 h. SARS-CoV-2 is highly stable at 4°C (Chin et al.; 2020). Groundwater samples
were included for analysis of sucralose, using 125 mlHDPE bottles.

2.3 Laboratory methods
2.3.1 RNA and DNA extraction – QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini
We followed standard procedures to extract and purify nucleic acids from the water
samples. Briefly, after viral thermal inactivation (95°C; 5 min), a volume of 500 µl of the
water sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 G. Then, a volume of 140 µl of the
supernatant was added to a mix containing 0.56 µl of Buffer AVL solution (Qiagen, USA)

and 5.6 µl of carrier RNA-AVE solution (Qiagen, USA) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
This mix was vortexed for 15 seconds, incubated at room temperature (15–25°C) for 10 min
and briefly centrifuged to remove drops from the interior surface of the lid. A volume of 560
µl of ethanol (96–100%) was added to the sample, and mixed by pulse-vortexing for 15 s.
After mixing, the tube was briefly centrifuged to remove drops from the interior surface
of the lid. Then, this solution (~630 µl) was filtered through a QIAamp Mini column (Qiagen,
USA) to retain the nucleic acids originally present in the sample. The retained material was
repeatedly washed with different buffer solutions to elute contaminants and purify the nucleic
acids. Then, the solution was loaded into the column contained in a 2 mL collection tube, the
cap of the tube was closed, and the tube with the column was centrifuged at 6000 x g (8000
rpm) for 1 min.
After centrifugation, the QIAamp Mini column was placed into a clean 2 ml collection
tube, and the filtrate was discarded. In the first raising step, 500 µl of 96% ethanol was loaded
into the column contained in the 2 mL collection tube, the cap of the tube was closed, and the
tube with the column was centrifuged at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. Following these two
centrifugation stages, 500 µl of buffer AW1 (Qiagen, USA) was added to the QIAamp Mini
column, the cap of the container tube was closed, and the tube with the column was centrifuged
at 6000 x g (8000 rpm) for 1 min. As before, the QIAamp Mini column was placed into a
clean 2 ml collection tube, and the filtrate was discarded. In a fourth centrifugation cycle, a
QIAamp Mini column was added to 500 µl buffer AW2 (Qiagen, USA), the cap of the
container tube was closed, and the tube with the column was centrifuged at high speed (20,000
x g; 14,000 rpm) for 3 min.
Then, the QIAamp Mini column was placed in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and
the filtrate was discarded. In a fifth centrifugation cycle, 60 µl buffer AVE (Qiagen, USA)
equilibrated to room temperature was added to the QIAamp Mini column, the cap of the
container tube was closed, and the tube with the column was centrifuged at a high speed (6,000
x g; 8,000 rpm) for 1 min.
For the DNA extraction, 500 µl of the water sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000
G; 400 µl of the centrifuge supernatant were discarded. The remaining 100 µl was added to
20 µl of proteinase K solution and 80 µl of buffer ATL (Qiagen, USA), vortexed, and

incubated at 56°C for at least 1 hour. The remainder of the extraction protocol was analogous
to that previously described.
2.3.2 RNA and DNA amplification
We amplified RNA segments of SARS-CoV-2 using two sets of primers (commonly
referred to as N1 and N2) in each amplification reaction. Both of these primers were directed
to sequences that encode the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. These primer sets have been
recommended and extensively used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in human samples
(Gonzalez-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Nalla et al., 2020) and wastewater (Medema et al., 2020;
Wu et al., 2020b; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Haramoto et al., 2020;
Scherchan et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020).
Similarly, we used two sets of primers to amplify the LAC and LAM regions of the
genome of Escherichia coli in the same reaction. E. coli is used as a biological indicator of
the presence of fecal content in water (Bej et al. 1990; Mo et al., 2002; Reza et al. 2014). The
sequences of both the forward and reverse primers used are shown in Table S1.
Quantitative amplification was conducted in a quantitative PCR thermal cycle (Rotor gene
Q 5plex, Qiagen, Germany). For the amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, the
amplification mix (final volume of 20 µl) consisted of 10 µl of 2X QuantiNova Syber Green
RT-Master Mix, 0.2 µl of QN SYBR Green RT-Mix, 1 µl of 10x primer mix (0.5 µM final
concentration), and 8.8 µl of RNA extract. For the amplification of DNA sequences of E. coli,
the amplification mix (final volume of 20 µl) consisted in 10 µl of 2X QuantiNova Syber
Green RT-Master Mix, 1 µl of 10x primer mix (0.5 µM final concentration), and 9.0 µl of
DNA extract. The amplification cycle consisted of 10 min of reverse transcription at 50°C and
2 min of amplification activation at 95°C, followed by 40 iterative cycles of denaturation for
5 s at 95°C and combined annealing and extension for 10 s at 60°C.
A calibration curve was constructed to establish the conversion between CT values and
equivalent gene copies per milliliter (copies ml). For this purpose, we used commercial
synthetic genetic material that contained the complete N gene from SARS-CoV-2 (Integrated
DNA Technologies, Iowa, USA). Samples containing different concentrations of synthetic
nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 (in the range of 10 to 100,000 copies ml-1) were prepared by

successive dilutions from stocks. This plasmid has been used before as a positive control in
amplification assays of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (González-Gonzalez et al., 2021). The
estimated lower limit of detection was ~1 copy of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 per mL of
water. The lowest positive value was 2.5 copies/ml.
2.3.3 Sucralose quantification
Sucralose is used as an artificial sweetener and useful tracer to demonstrate the presence
of human wastewater in groundwater (Kokotou et al., 2012; Voss et al., 2019). Sucralose
presence was determined using high performance liquid chromatography and mass
spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS) after solid-phase extraction (SOE). Isotope-labeled
internal standards and an external calibration in tap water were used for quantification. Details
of the analytical method are given in Table S2. The analysis was performed at DVGWTechnologiezentrum Wasser, Karlsruhe, Germany.
2.4 Monitoring of COVID-19 cases in Monterrey Metropolitan Area
To obtain an indication of the sensitivity of the monitoring of the urban water cycle, a proxy
for the period prevalence of COVID-19 in the MMA was created using the reported number
of COVID-19 cases per day (CONACyT, 2021) and the normalized cumulative number of
reported COVID-19 cases per day for 2020. Normalization was performed by dividing the
cumulative number of reported cases by the population size.

3. Results
3.1 Reported cases
The number of reported COVID-19 cases in each of the 12 municipalities and MMA
shows that the pandemic evolved at different rates in each of the municipalities as it spread
during 2020 (Fig. 2a). The first infection was reported on March 10, and the number of cases
remained relatively low until mid-May, when another increase occurred, and starting from
June 10, the infection maintained a constant increase in the MMA, with the exception of
November, when the number of cases dropped. Santiago and Monterrey municipalities
reported the most cases, followed by Santa Catarina, Guadalupe and San Nicolas.

However, it is worth to noting that these numbers are not directly comparable to other
countries or regions because the collection methods are not necessarily standardized, and the
sampling efforts are probably different from and asynchronized respect to the real infection
dates (Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2020). Freshwater sampling for this report was performed
during the second peak of the outbreak of the epidemic: end of October, end of November
2020, mid-December 2020 and beginning January 2021 (Fig. 2ab).

3.2 Groundwater
Two field campaigns were performed for groundwater. Regarding the first campaign, the
qRT–PCR concentration threshold (Ct) average values for SARS-CoV-2 ranged from 30.2 to
over 40 (Table 2). Interestingly, nearly half of the samples (19 of 40) were positive, and 38%
of the samples that tested positive had Ct values below the value of 33. In this study, a sample
was arbitrarily defined as “positive” when a Ct value was detected in at least two of three
replicates. Two of seven samples in the BA well field were detected positive, with Ct values
of 30.2 and 32.4. Galeria 4 is a well at the entrance to the Huasteca highway, with a high urban
development in the area prior to the entrance, while Pozo 39 is in the lower area of the Sierra
Madre close to ranches and houses. Five out of eight samples in the SA system were reported
to be positive, with a Ct value between 32.5 and 36.3. Estanzuela is in a woodland-rural
environment, while Cola de Caballo Tunnels and San Francisco Tunnel represent horizontal
galleries in piedmont shrubland. Finally, Margarita is a well located in an urban development
area. Thirteen out of 26 production wells in the ZM aquifer had positive samples, with Ct
values between 30.3 and 34.2. These sites are dispersed in the urbanized MMA. A trend
showed a higher proportion of sites affected in the downstream area in the northeastern portion
(Apodaca), and no positive samples in the southeastern portion (Contry) of the ZM aquifer.
Sucralose was detected in 22 out of 40 samples (55%) (Table 2), and its concentrations
varied between 0.07 and 2.9 µg/l. In the BA well field, which represents desert and piedmont
shrubland with a low population density, none of the samples had detectable levels. In the SA
system, one site (Andares) had concentrations of sucralose close to the detection limit, and
one site (Margaritas) had a sample with one of the highest concentrations. These sites
represented residential areas. In the urbanized ZM aquifer, 20 out of 25 well sites (80%) had
detectable concentrations of sucralose, whose values ranged between 0.1 and 2.7 µg/l. These
results are generally consistent with the land use distribution, and all except one site in
urbanized or industrial plots had samples with sucralose . In addition, we found a significant
correlation between sucralose and Ct values (r2=0.62, n=0.043) but no correlation between Ct
values and groundwater depth.
The samples that were positive in the first sampling campaign and not located close to
each other were repeated for a second campaign (Table 2). In the second sampling campaign

only 3 out of 10 sites tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that groundwater was
less affected on the second sampling date, and only three sites had samples that were
consistently positive on both dates, namely, California 2, Lincoln 2 and Puentes 1 in
Monterrey municipality. It is notable that the depth-to-water table of these sites was less than
22 m.

3.3 Surface water
Two sampling campaigns were performed in surface water reservoirs between the end of
October and mid-December 2020 (Table 3). For the first period in October 2020 none of the
samples were detected positive. For the second sampling period two sites had samples that
tested positive, one in the La Boca dam (33.8) and another in the Cerro Prieto dam (33.6). It
was not possible to analyze the correlation between the Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 and E. coli
because only two pairs had quantitative data.

With respect to river water, two sampling campaigns were performed in December 2020
and in January 2021. In December, three out of twelve samples tested positive, with Ct values
ranging from 32.7 to 34.2. The sites with positive values were the Pesqueria River downstream
of WWTP Norte, Santa Catarina River upstream of WWTP Cadereyta, and La Silla River
upstream of Tolteca Park. For the second sampling period, two out of twelve samples were
positive, namely, the Pesquería River upstream WWTP Norte and La Silla River at upstream
of Tolteca Park (Table 4). The result for La Silla River was notable because this river receives

no treated wastewaters of domestic origin. The Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 correlated with
those of E. coli (r2=0.75, n=0.088); however the correlation was weak due to the low number
of pairs.

For reference, untreated wastewater from the influent of the Dulces Nombres WWTP
was measured for SARS-CoV-2. Between October 25, 2020, and December 13, 2020, 3 out
of 8 samples (38%) were positive. The Ct value of positive samples ranged from 23.5 to 31.2.

4. Discussion
4.1 Contextualization of the findings in freshwater environments
This is the first study that quantifies the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different freshwater
environments of an urban setting. Previous studies that aimed to detect the virus in freshwater
focused on receiving rivers (Table 5). For example, Rimoldi et al. (2020) collected grab
samples at three sites of receptor rivers in the Milan area on April 14 and 22, 2020. In the first
sampling round, all three samples were positive, while in the second round only one out of
three samples was positive. A quantitative analysis was not performed. Similarly, Haramoto
et al. (2020) collected grab water samples in a river in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, on three
different occasions between April 22 and May 7, 2020; they reported that no sample tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Guerrero-Latorre et al. (2020) reported viral loads during a peak of the outbreak (June 5,
2020) from three different sites of a river receiving untreated sewage from Quito city. The
authors used RT-qPCR for these determinations and two different primer sets, namely N1 and
N2. All samples were found to be positive, and the values ranged from 284 to 3190 GC/ml
and from 207 to 2230 GC/ml in assays using the N1 and N2 target regions, respectively. These
values could be related clearly to COVID-19 cases reported in the contributing areas.

4.2 Explanation of viral loads in receiving waters
In the present study, 13% of all river water samples (3 out of 24) were positive regarding
viral RNA, and the viral RNA amounts in the positive samples varied between 2.5 and 7.0
GC/ml (Fig. 3ab). Importantly, during this period no significant rainfall was recorded in the
Monterrey area that could have had an impact on virus concentration in the water. These loads
are two to three orders of magnitude lower than those reported by Guerrero-Latorre et al.
(2020) for Quito’s river. This could be because Monterrey treats more than 95% of its
municipal wastewater, while the urban rivers of Quito are impacted by the direct discharge of
sewage water from the city (3 million inhabitants). Similarly, the negative results derived from
the analysis of river water samples from Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan (Haramoto et al. 2020)
and Milan, Italy (Rimoldi et al. 2020) could be attributed to the fact that both studies collected
water from rivers receiving treated wastewater.

It is expected that wastewater from WWTPs that is completely treated would test
negative. Thus, the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a few samples in La Silla and
Pesquería River water could stem from different wastewater sources coexisting in the same
basin. For example, aliquots of untreated sewage can be present because of illegal discharges,
local malfunctions of sewerage systems, and their increased relative contribution during dry
periods (Mosley et al. 2015). The lack of separation of urban runoff water from the domestic
effluents, which causes combined sewer overflows (CSOs), could also be a reason for this
occurrence of viral loads (Rimoldi et al. 2020). CSOs occur usually during high rainfall events.
However, the accumulated rainfall between December 2020 and January 2021 in Monterrey
was only 3 mm.
Another reason for the high aliquots of untreated sewage in river water could be the
organization of local football derbies, whose high loads in short time periods may overburden
the capacity of WWTPs to release untreated wastewater to the Pesquería river (SADM, 2020).
The case of the La Silla River is notable because it receives no relevant treated municipal
wastewater due to sanitary drainage to the other two rivers; therefore illegal discharges or a
local sewage system malfunction is a plausible explanation for the presence of SARS-CoV-2
genetic material in this water course.
Regarding dam water, only 12% of the samples (2 out of 16) tested positive for SARSCoV-2 RNA (Fig. 3a), with no positive result in the first campaign (22-23 October 2020). The
positive samples (which contained 3.3 and 3.8 viral copies/ml) occurred during the second
campaign (14-15 December 2020) and only at one site in the La Boca and at one site in the
Cerro Prieto dam, respectively. In both cases, a village is located nearby, which suggests that
the presence of the virus might be due to failure of the local sewage system. The observed
values were comparable to the range of values in the urban rivers in Monterrey. The lack of
viral loads in the first campaign and the presence of viral loads at two of the nine sites in the
second campaign may reflect the increasing trend in reported cases of infection in the
corresponding municipalities during the same period (Fig. 1a).

4.3 Viral load in groundwater reaffirms human sewage impact
The number of groundwater samples containing detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
surprisingly high. Twenty-two out of 50 samples (44%) had viral loads between 2.9 and 38.3
GC/ml (Fig. 3a). This finding suggests that a fraction of untreated sewage entered the
groundwater system. The origin of the untreated sewage may have been from the surface or
from a leaky sewage system. Torres-Hernández et al. (2020) used isotopic and chemical
evidence to determine that nitrate pollution in groundwater from Monterrey was mainly
derived from sewage leaks in urban areas. It is evident that organic and viral loads could have
entered the groundwater system using the same pathway. The significant correlation between
SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and sucralose at the 0.05 level is another remarkable
confirmation of the contribution of raw wastewater to the groundwater and reaffirms possible
leaching and infiltration of effluents from health care facilities, sewage, solid landfills, and
drainage water as well as failing sewage pipes in the MMA (Fig. 3c).
From the three aquifer units used for water supply, the SA system (63%) was most
affected, followed by the ZM aquifer (54%), and the BA well field (22%). Nevertheless, the
viral loads observed in the wells of the first sampling campaign (29 October 2020 - 4
November 2020) were only partly reproduced one month later (26-30 November 2020),
indicating a decrease in the viral load. This result demonstrates how dynamic the groundwater
system is in relation to the presence of the coronavirus; the decline of the viral load in
groundwater appeared to follow the decreasing trend in reported cases of infection during the
month of November 2020 (Fig. 2a).
From the sampled municipalities in the MMA during the first campaign, Apodaca had
the most positive samples at with 63% of the samples, followed by Monterrey (50%), and San
Nicolas (50%). Coincidently, these are the most affected municipalities considering the
officially reported daily cases of infection in Fig. 2a. Guadalupe was also among the most
affected municipalities; however, it was represented by only one sampled well. Santiago, the
southernmost municipality was the exception as it had a relatively lower number of cases of
infection, but a high incidence of positive cases (63%). This scenario could indicate a different
dynamic. Generally, the high number of positive samples in municipalities with highest

number of COVID infections suggests that groundwater samples approximately mirror the
infection situation at the municipality level.
4.4 Implications for public health
This study provides the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may enter groundwater through
possible leaching events and infiltration of effluent from health care facilities, sewage, solid
landfills and drainage water, as well as leakages from sewage pipes. Groundwater in the MMA
is currently disinfected by gas chlorination removing pathogenic viruses and bacteria before
entering the water supply system. Since coronaviruses are sensitive to oxidants such as
chlorine (La Rosa et al., 2020b), it is important to continue strengthening and advancing the
treatment processes of groundwater, especially in wells located in shallow aquifers and in
places where sewage effluent from health care facilities, sewage, solid landfills and drainage
water is not treated or treated inefficiently (Guerrero-Latorre et al. 2020) and is expected to
infiltrate, or where sewage pipes could be leaky (Torres-Hernandez et al., 2020).
The concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater from selected studies
worldwide were in the range of not detected to 5600 GC/ml (Table 5). In our study,
monitoring of the influent at the Dulces Nombres WWTP showed that between October 25,
2020, and December 13, 2020, 3 out of 8 samples (38%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and
that the maximum load was 3535 GC/ml (Fig. 3b). This number is quite comparable to other
studies of raw wastewater during outbreaks (Nemudryi et al., 2020; Randazzo et al. 2020;
Torttier et al, 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Table 5). This result shows
that the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the surface water (<5.6 GC/ml) and groundwater
(<38.3 GC/ml) in the MMA is approximately two to three orders of magnitude lower than that
in raw wastewater. This means that the viral load could not be eradicated completely, as
observed in Haramoto et al. (2020); however the result in this study is similar to that in
Rimoldi et al. (2020).
The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in natural waters receiving treated or
untreated wastewater effluents raises the important question of whether there is a risk of
infection. Since urban water courses and dams are very popular places for recreation, there is
concern about the risks of infection. The transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 by ingestion
25

is still controversial but potentially occurs (Amirian et al., 2020). Kumar et al. (2021)
suggested a quantitative microbial risk assessment framework to estimate the potential risk
from SARS-CoV-2 in natural water bodies through various water activities, based on the
framework for SARS-CoV developed by Watanabe et al. (2010). The support for this
approach is that there is no risk assessment model available for ingestion of water with SARSCoV-2 and that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 species have similar genetics and
infection mechanisms. According to this approach, the chances of infection by a virus are
calculated by a dose–response model, which describes relations of viral exposure dose and the
probability of infection and can be calculated by an exponential model with the following
equation:

𝑑

𝑝 (𝑟⁄𝑑 ) = 1 − 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (− 𝑘 )

(1)

where 𝑝 (𝑟⁄𝑑)is the chance of infection at the viral dose of 𝑑, 𝑑 is dose of the virus (PFU,
plaque-forming unit), and 𝑘 is 4.2 × 102 (PFU). The expected dose of the virus is estimated
from the volume of water ingested and the viral concentration in the water. The median
volume of water ingested per event is reported to be 6.0 ml when swimming and 2.0 ml when
fishing (Dorevitch et al., 2011). Considering a viral load of 7.0 copies/ml in the rivers of MMA
(Fig. 3b), the estimated chance of infection per event was derived from equation (1) as 1.0 x
10-7 for swimming and 3.4 x 10-8 for fishing.
These findings suggest a very low risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during recreation
in waters receiving treated wastewater from the MMA. However, the presence of detectable
amounts of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 in fresh water should not be ignored. There
exist situations where the infection risk may increase considerably. For example, the
occurrence of CSO events during COVID-19 outbreaks may cause a substantial increase in
the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 by exposure to receiving water bodies (Kumar et al., 2021).
Another situation is that residual chlorine may not be maintained in sufficient concentration
to control the virus. Consider a fictional case where raw wastewater from the Dulces Nombres
WWTP with 3535 copies/ml is discharged into the riverbed without dilution as may occur
26

during a drought period, then the chances of infection increase to 5.2 x 10-5 and 1.7 x 10-5 for
swimming and fishing, respectively.
Under normal operating conditions, the infection risk in groundwater is minimal if the
pumping wells are on a well seal, which protects it from surface contamination, and the
disinfection system is working properly. However, in a leaky pumping well, the infiltration of
human effluent spills combined with a failure in the disinfection system may considerably
increase the infection risk. Assuming a sludge concentration of 105 copies/ml infiltrates and
is diluted 5 times in groundwater, then the immediate chance of infection from drinking a
glass of untreated water is 0.15%. Therefore, an annual, preventative water-well maintenance
inspection is important to avoid any risks of a COVID-19 infection through groundwater.
It is important to note that these values could be underestimated and have large
uncertainty associated with them, because SARS-CoV-2 is potentially more infectious than
SARS-CoV from which the model is derived (Kitajima et al., 2020). On the other hand, the
proportion of viable RNA copies in the measured viral load was not known. SARS-CoV-2
RNA was found to be significantly more persistent than infectious SARS-CoV-2, indicating
that the environmental detection of RNA alone does not substantiate the risk of infection
(Bivins et al., 2020). Thus, this risk assessment model should be considered a preliminary
estimation or base line of the associated health risks for SARS-CoV-2 in aquatic
environments.
4.5 Limitations and future directions
This study shows the importance of monitoring programs to determine the fate of SARSCoV-2 in the urban water cycle. To date, there is no evidence related to the fate of SARSCoV-2 in the urban water cycle, and few datasets exist to confirm whether water or wastewater
containing SARS-CoV-2 could be potentially infectious. Some studies have predicted a low
risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater (Chin et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020), but
this topic still deserves attention and further detailed examinations (Buonerba et al., 2021). It
is necessary to monitor natural waters, especially in countries or areas that have limited
capacities of wastewater treatment.

Future research should be oriented towards the development of a proper SARS-CoV-2
infection risk assessment model, considering the virus in its different variants. This model
could be based on dose-response approaches developed for other pathogens (Watanabe et al.
2010; de Man et al., 2014) and use SARS-CoV-2 data sets yet to be developed from
experiments.
Another area of opportunity is to study the SARS-CoV-2 removal efficiency of
wastewater treatment processes including disinfection. One limitation of this study is a lack
of understanding of how the removal efficiency of a WWTP contributes to the dilution of the
viral load in the receiving river water. In general, there is still minimal knowledge about the
removal of enveloped viruses in wastewater (Kumar et al., 2021).
The use of chemical and microbial markers for human wastewater could assist in not only
evaluating the removal efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities but also understanding
the routes and fates of SARS-CoV-2 in natural water systems. For biosafety purposes,
surrogate viruses such as the murine hepatitis virus and phages were employed successfully
due to their structural and morphological similarity to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. Ahmed et al.,
2020b). The combined use of selected markers could provide additional information about the
dilution, decay, and inhibition factors of the new coronavirus in aquatic environments.
Studies performed to date show that there is a lack of standardized protocols for sampling,
detecting and quantifying of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater (Table 5). For example,
in some studies grab samples were obtained, while in others 24-hour composite samples were
collected. In this study we used a sample size (125 ml) and recognize that larger samples
would be a more appropriate choice and that would have derived in a more representative
finding. Also, the sampling duration was relatively short.
There were significant differences in not only sample collection but also sample storage
and treatment and the use (or not) of genetic or chemical traces (i.e., chemical agents
indicating human activity or viral tracers used for normalization purposes). This may lead to
discrepancies in the results. Currently, RT-qPCR has been employed widely for detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in water samples; however it is imperative to develop a standard sampling
procedure for accurate extraction, isolation, detection and quantification of the virus. The N
gene (N1&N2) is the most abundant transcript of SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore a good target

for the detection of the virus in samples (Babiker et al., 2020; Chakraborty et al., 2021). Interand intralaboratory comparisons such as those employed by Chick et al. (2021) may lead to
global standardization.

5. Conclusions
This study evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different freshwater areas of
a metropolitan area and the implications for the environment and public health. As such, this
study represents a contribution to the ongoing discussion on the potential routes and fate of
SARS-CoV-2 in freshwater environments receiving wastewater and water safety concerns.
This is the first study that detected and quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in groundwater.
Nearly half of the samples showed detectable genetic material. This result suggests that in a
pump well, sewage from the surface or from a leaky sewage system entered the groundwater
system. Moreover, the temporal and submetropolitan variations in the viral loads in
groundwater mimic the reported trend in cases of infection in ZMM.
The share of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urban rivers (21%) and dams (12%) was
lower than that in groundwater. The quantitative results show that the viral loads in these
waters were three orders of magnitude lower than the maximum value measured in raw
wastewater during the same time period. It is assumed that aliquots of nontreated sewage due
to illegal discharges, local malfunctions of the sewage system and their increased relative
contribution during the dry period may have been the factors. Again, there was a correlation
between the temporal variation in the viral loads in the surface waters and the trend in the
reported cases of infections. A preliminary risk assessment model suggests that, considering
the viral loads found during this study in the receiving waters of Monterrey, the potential of
infection was low for recreational activities (swimming, fishing, etc.). However, this situation
should not be taken lightly because the occurrence of combined sewer overflow events and/or
temporal failures of disinfection systems may cause substantial increases in infection risks.
This study shows that knowledge about the routes and fates of SARS-CoV-2 in the
environment is still in the early stage and that datasets for water are scarce. In the short term,
it is important to monitor especially natural water systems that receive untreated or poorly
treated wastewaters. In the medium and long term, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an

opportunity for the international community to accelerate the UN Sustainability Development
Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation for all) by fostering financial and technical support to
programs that increase the capacity of preventative water-well maintenance inspections and
wastewater treatment, especially in less developed countries.
Future research and innovation efforts in this regard should be oriented towards: (i) the
development of a proper SARS-CoV-2 infection risk assessment model for water and
wastewater; (ii) an assessment of the removal efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater
treatment processes including disinfection; (iii) the combined use of chemical and
microbiological markers for tracing the routes, decay and inhibition factors of SARS-CoV-2
in water; and (iv) the development of standardized protocols for sampling, detecting and
quantifying SARS-CoV-2 in the environment.
