Abstract
Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal
characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19
are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1965 healthcare workers,
of which 381 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at
study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in most participants, 96%, at
least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. Virus
neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 91% of study
participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike
protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 80% of previously
anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers. Both anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG
levels were significantly higher in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients four months
post infection than in healthcare workers four months post infection (p=2*10-23 and 2*10-13
respectively). Although the magnitude of humoral response was associated with disease
severity, our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2
infection even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody
kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as
target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), has taken global pandemic proportions. Despite a steady
increase in the number of fatalities worldwide, the vast majority of infected individuals
develop no or mild symptoms. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is likely facilitated by a
substantial portion of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission 1,2. Understanding the
durability and functionality of the immune response in mild and asymptomatic cases is
therefore critical in the attempt to contain the disease and to gain insight of the potential of
re-infection.

Antibodies targeting various virus-encoded proteins are central players in conveying
protective immunity against viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The most commonly
targeted antigens in currently available serology assays are the SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein, which enables viral access to the host cell, and the abundant and highly
conserved nucleocapsid protein 3,4. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is the main target
antigen for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development. It is now well-established that
circulating IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are detected in the majority of infected individuals
after 9-21 days from symptom onset 5-9. The kinetics, duration and efficacy of circulating
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are however, due to the novelty of the virus, less established. In
fact, conflicting studies provide data on a rapid decline in circulating IgG antibodies within
weeks after COVID-19 10-12, especially after mild disease 13-15, while others report detectable
antibodies up to two to six months after symptom onset 16-19.

The COMMUNITY (COVID-19 Immunity) study is an ongoing longitudinal study investigating
long-term immunity after COVID-19 in a large group of individuals with a wide variety of
COVID-19 symptoms. Between April 15th and May 8th, 2020, 2149 health care workers
(HCW), and 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Cross-sectional
clinical, demographic and serological data of the HCW at study inclusion has been presented

elsewhere 20. The objective of this first follow-up was to assess the duration and efficacy of
circulating antibodies four months after infection. Our findings show that a durable anti-spike
IgG response is generated in the vast majority of convalescent individuals, even after
asymptomatic or mild infection, and that these antibodies remain capable of virus
neutralization. In contrast, anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels declined in a large portion of
individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease, but not in individuals with severe to critical
disease. These findings have important implications for public health planning, as well as for
assessing potential risk of reinfection and vaccine responses.

Results
Characteristics of study participants
A total of 1965 HCW and 59 convalescent COVID-19 patients remained in the study for the
four-month follow-up between August 24th and September 11th, 2020. IgG antibodies against
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (full length trimer) and a 118 aa-long C-terminal domain of the
nucleocapsid protein were analyzed in all samples at inclusion in April/May 2020 and at fourmonth follow-up. The majority of HCW were women (n=1669, 85%) and the mean age was
44 (SD 12) years. Of the 1965 HCW, 350 individuals (18%) presented antibodies recognizing
both spike and nucleocapsid at inclusion, whereas 31 (2%) presented only anti-spike IgG
and 80 (4%) presented only anti-nucleocapsid IgG. Of the 461 HCW presenting antibodies
recognizing spike and/or nucleocapsid at inclusion, 406 (88%), had mild symptoms prior to
study inclusion, and 55 (12%) had been asymptomatic. The patient group was predominantly
male (69%), and the mean age was higher than that of HCW; 56 (SD 14) years (p=3*10-9).
All COVID-19 patients were shown to have antibodies recognizing both spike and
nucleocapsid at study inclusion.

Persistence of circulating anti-spike IgG
At the four-month follow-up, we first assessed the longevity of anti-spike IgG. The vast
majority of HCW who were anti-spike IgG positive at inclusion (96%; 366/381), and all

convalescent COVID-19 patients remained anti-spike IgG positive at the four-month followup. Follow-up levels of anti-spike IgG were significantly higher in convalescent COVID-19
patients (21238 MFI [AU] (IQR 19371-22737)) than HCW (12010 MFI [AU] (IQR 774716629)); p=2*10-23, Fig. 1A). In addition, high antibody levels in HCW were associated with
several self-reported symptoms prior to study inclusion, including fever, dyspnea, cough,
abdominal pain, ageusia, malaise, and anosmia (Fig. 1B).

Persistence of circulating anti-nucleocapsid IgG
Although nucleocapsid antibodies are not believed to be capable of direct neutralization of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen remains target in many
commercially available assays due to its high abundance and immunogenicity 21. The
nucleocapsid has furthermore reported a higher sensitivity compared to the spike protein
when screening populations early in the seroconversion phase 22. We therefore proceeded to
analyze anti-nucleocapsid IgG at the four-month follow-up. Of the 59 convalescent COVID19 patients, 58 (98%) remained seropositive for anti-nucleocapsid IgG at the four-month
follow-up. In contrast to anti-spike IgG, only 80% (342/430) of previously anti-nucleocapsid
IgG positive HCW remained anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive at four-month follow-up. Still, the
four-month follow-up levels were significantly lower in HCW (8584 MFI [AU] (IQR 439612693)) than in convalescent COVID-19 patients (14966 MFI [AU] (IQR 11744-16499);
p=2*10-13)) (Fig 2A). The four-month follow-up levels of anti-nucleocapsid IgG among HCW
were, in line with follow-up levels of anti-spike IgG, associated with several self-reported
symptoms prior to study inclusion (Fig 2B).

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies
Using a microneutralization assay, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potential was determined in all
425 individuals who were anti-spike IgG positive both at inclusion and at four-month followup (366 HCW and 59 convalescent COVID-19 patients) and in a subgroup of anti-spike IgG

negative individuals at four-month follow-up (197 HCW). Neutralizing potential was confirmed
in 94% (401 of 425) of anti-spike IgG positive samples and in none of the anti-spike IgG
negative samples (Fig 3A). Anti-spike IgG antibodies were observed at a wide range of
levels, and also samples with low levels were capable of virus neutralization (Fig 3A).
Interestingly, virus neutralization capacity in HCW who were anti-spike IgG positive both at
study inclusion and follow-up was found to be associated with COVID-19 symptoms prior to
study inclusion, with an almost ten-fold probability (OR=9.8 (95% CI 3.8-26)) of virus
neutralization capacity if symptomatic compared to asymptomatic (Fig 3B). As expected, no
virus neutralization potential was found in any samples with anti-nucleocapsid IgG alone (Fig
3C). The marked association of virus neutralization with anti-spike IgG, and the lack thereof
with anti-nucleocapsid IgG, was confirmed using a multivariable logistic regression model
accounting for the interaction of the IgGs (pseudo-R2=0.95; OR0-5000 AU (CI): anti-spike=521
(45-12000), anti-nucleocapsid=5.9 (0.62-35)).

Seroconversion during the study period
Among HCW who were anti-spike IgG negative (n=1584) or anti-nucleocapsid IgG negative
(n=1535) at study inclusion, 8% (134/1584) developed anti-spike IgG, and 7% (113/1535)
developed anti-nucleocapsid IgG, respectively, during the four-month follow-up period.
Seroconversion was associated with lower age for both antigens (mean (SD) years: antispike IgG: seroconversion=42 (11), seronegative=44 (12), p = 0.01; anti-nucleocapsid IgG:
seroconversion=41 (11), seronegative=44 (12), p = 0.003), but not with sex (anti-spike IgG:
ORmale=0.98 (0.58 - 1.6), p=1; anti-nucleocapsid IgG: ORmale=1.2 (0.72 - 2), p=0.4). Similar to
seroconversion prior to study inclusion 20, seroconversion during the four-month follow-up
was for both antigens associated with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Fig 4).

Discussion
Understanding the long-term humoral response including virus neutralization capacity in
asymptomatic to mild SARS-CoV-2 infections is key in estimating the immunity on a

population basis, potential risk of reinfection and vaccine responses. In this longitudinal study
including a large group of individuals with a wide range of COVID-19 symptoms, we show
that the vast majority remain seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG at least four
months post infection. We furthermore corroborate prior findings of strong concordance
between SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and virus neutralization capacity, supporting a longlasting and durable immunity after COVID-19 infection also in individuals with no or mild
symptoms. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG, however, declined in individuals with asymptomatic to
mild COVID-19 disease, implying that this antigen may not be a useful target in long-term
serological population studies.

Our findings of a durable IgG response are consistent with recent studies showing stable
antibody levels for up to 2-6 months 16-19. Several other studies, however, report a rapid
decline in circulating SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 10-12, especially after mild disease 13-15. Since
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic a plethora of serological assays have emerged, using
different methods such as ELISA, CLIA, lateral flow and multiplex systems 23. Although the
discrepancies regarding the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may well stem from
variations in sensitivity and specificity of these assays, the target antigen of choice is a likely
contributing factor. Notably, many of the widely used commercially available serological
assays target the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen or linear peptides of the protein 23,24.
Early investigations 25,26 presented results indicating that detection of antibodies against the
nucleocapsid protein render more sensitive analyses than detection of antibodies against the
spike protein, and several assays targeting the nucleocapsid protein have been validated to
high sensitivities and specificities 23. These validations were, however, conducted on
samples taken acutely or shortly after infection where the nucleocapsid protein has shown to
provide high sensitivity 22. The different patterns of anti-spike IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG
responses during the acute and convalescent phase in this study imposes questions
regarding accuracy of these assays over time and emphasizes the importance of careful

antigen selection. Although it is too early to determine if the presence of neutralizing
antibodies indicate protective immunity, our findings imply that serology assays aiming at
assessing long-term immunity should be based on the spike protein rather than on the
nucleocapsid protein.

It is well documented that SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels correlate to COVID-19 disease
severity 10,13,27,28. Duration and levels of both anti-spike IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG at
four-month follow-up were higher in convalescent COVID-19 patients, suffering severe to
critical COVID-19, than in seropositive HCW with no or mild symptoms, supporting an
association to disease severity. In addition, both IgG levels and virus neutralizing potential
were associated with self-reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection prior to
study inclusion in the HCW group However, the HCW group was both younger and
presumably healthier than the convalescent COVID-19 patient group. The HCW group
furthermore comprised 85% women, whereas the convalescent COVID-19 patient group
comprised only 31% women, hampering comparisons between the groups.

A portion of HCW that were seronegative at inclusion seroconverted during the four-month
follow-up. In line with data presented from April/May 2020 20, we now further corroborate
associations between seroconversion and certain COVID-19 symptoms. As shown in
April/May, the strongest associations remained to anosmia and ageusia, emphasizing that
these symptoms should be included in routine screening guidance.

Although this study is strengthened by the large sample size and the longitudinal design with
close to complete follow-up, there are certain limitations worth noting. Study inclusion took
place simultaneously for HCW and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, regardless of whether
and when HCW had symptoms compatible with COVID-19. A relatively large portion of
seropositive HCW furthermore reported to have had no symptoms. Although the time window
of infection is quite narrow in this group, considering that study inclusion started early in the

Swedish pandemic, the precise time of infection remains uncertain. A direct comparison of
antibody levels between HCW and hospitalized COVID-19 patients at study inclusion was
therefore not appropriate. However, the levels and efficacy of neutralizing antibodies at
follow-up, which was within 4-5 months post infection in both the patient and HCW groups,
are more indicative of a persistent measurable humoral immunity than the dynamics between
initial sampling and follow-up.

Taken together, our findings imply a strong and long-lasting humoral immune response
against SARS-CoV-2, even after asymptomatic or mild infection. We furthermore reveal
different patterns of acute and convalescent anti-spike IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG
responses, and show that anti-spike IgG remain detectable in 96% of individuals while antinucleocapsid IgG declined to undetectable levels in 20% of the study group with mild
infection. These findings have high relevance in gaining understanding of long-term humoral
immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provide important insights towards public health
planning, potential risk of reinfection and evaluation of long-term vaccine responses.

Methods
Study population
The longitudinal COMMUNITY study (COVID-19 Biomarker and Immunity study, dnr 202001653) is conducted at Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The study population and
hospital setting are described elsewhere 20. A total of 2149 HCW and 118 hospitalized
COVID-19 patients were included at baseline 20. COVID-19 patients were diagnosed by
reverse-transcriptase PCR viral detection of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs, and
the only exclusion criterium was age <18 years. PCR viral detection was not available for
HCW, regardless of symptoms, prior to study inclusion. HCW were eligible to participate in
the study irrespective of whether they had had symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak
onset or not. All study participants (HCW and convalescent COVID-19 patients) were invited
for a follow-up visit between August 25th and September 17th, 2020. 91% (1969/2149) of

HCW and 50% (59/118) of convalescent COVID-19 patients came for the follow-up. HCW
not hospitalized due to COVID-19 before study inclusion (n=1965) were included in this
study. Convalescent COVID-19 patients who did not come for the follow-up were either
diseased (n=14) or did not answer on repeated invitations (n=45). Demographic data was
obtained from medical journals. A questionnaire was completed by all HCW prior to each
blood sampling, comprising demographics (age and sex), self-reported predefined symptoms
compatible with COVID-19 (fever, headache, anosmia, ageusia, cough, malaise, common
cold, abdominal pain, sore throat, shortness of breath, joint/muscle pain) prior to blood
sampling, occupation, work location and self-reported exposure to patients or household
members with confirmed COVID-19 infection. 100% of HCW completed the follow-up
questionnaire.

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (dnr 2020-01653), and
informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

Serological analyses of antibodies
Venous blood samples were obtained at study inclusion and at the four-month follow-up. At
study inclusion, plasma samples were prepared from whole blood following centrifugation for
20 min at 2000 g at room temperature and stored at −80 °C until further analyses. At the
four-month follow-up, serum samples were prepared by centrifugation at 2000g for 10
minutes in room temperature and stored at -80oC for further analyses. Serological analyses
were performed as earlier described 20. Briefly, a multiplex antigen bead array was used in
high throughput 384-plates format using the FlexMap3D (Luminex Corp). IgG reactivity was
measured towards spike trimers comprising the prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein
ectodomain (in-house produced, expressed in HEK and purified using a C-terminal Strep II
tag) and the C-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid protein (in-house produced, expressed in
Escherichia coli and purified using a 427 C-terminal His-tag). The threshold for seropositive

response for each protein was determined by the mean level plus six times the standard
deviation from twelve negative controls analysed in each assay.

Microneutralization assay
Microneutralization assay was performed as earlier described 29. Briefly, serum was heat
inactivated and 10-fold diluted in duplicate. Each dilution was mixed with tissue culture of
SARS-CoV-2 and incubated. The cells were inspected for signs of cytopathogenic effect
(CPE) by optical microscopy after four days. If <50% of the cell layer showed signs of CPE
the well was scored as neutralizing.

Statistical analyses
Antibody levels were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and are presented as
medians, interquartile ranges (IQR), and p-values. Age was compared using Student’s t-test,
and is presented as mean, standard deviation (SD), and p-value. Associations of categorical
variables, e.g. serostatus, antibody persistence, symptoms, and sex, were examined using
Fisher’s exact test, and are presented as proportion, odds ratio (OR), and confidence interval
(CI).
To assess the individual influence of anti-spike IgG levels and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels
on virus neutralization, these data were fitted in a logistic regression model specified as
log(𝑂𝑅) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑀𝐹𝐼𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖−𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑒 𝐼𝑔𝐺 + 𝛽2 𝑀𝐹𝐼𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖−𝑛𝑢𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑠𝑖𝑑 𝐼𝑔𝐺
+ 𝛽12 𝑀𝐹𝐼𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖−𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑘𝑒 𝐼𝑔𝐺 𝑀𝐹𝐼𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖−𝑛𝑢𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑠𝑖𝑑 𝐼𝑔𝐺
where the product term was used to control for the interaction of anti-spike and antinucleocapsid IgGs. Model fit was estimated using the Cragg-Uhler pseudo-R2, and odds
ratios for an increase in MFI from 0 to 5000 AU were calculated using the estimated model
coefficients as 𝑒 𝛽×5000.
Statistics and data visualization were performed in R 30 using packages tidyverse, rlang,
pander, knitr, scales, ggsignif, ggbeeswarm, exact2x2, egg, cowplot, jtools, and oddsratio.
