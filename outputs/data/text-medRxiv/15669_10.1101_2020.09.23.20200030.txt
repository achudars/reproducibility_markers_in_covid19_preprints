Abstract
Background
COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases could be symptomatic or asymptomatic. In the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), the identified COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases are yet to be
characterized. In this study, we characterized the first cohort of COVID-19 RT-PCR
confirmed cases reported in the Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE, according to symptomatic state,
and identified factors associated with the symptomatic state. Also, the strength of association
between the symptomatic state and testing positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing
rounds was examined and quantified.
Method
We analyzed data collected from the first cohort of the RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases
reported to the health authorities in the Abu Dhabi Emirate – UAE between February 28 and
April 08, 2020. Self-reported sociodemographic, working status, travel history, and chronic
comorbidities of 1,249 COVID-19 cases were analyzed according to symptomatic state
(symptomatic and asymptomatic). After the first RT-PCR confirmatory test, the results of
three subsequent testing rounds were also analyzed.
Results
A total of 791 confirmed cases with a mean age of 35.6 years±12.7 (range: 1-81 years) and
information on symptomatic state were analyzed. Nearly, 57.0% were symptomatic COVID19 cases. The most frequent two symptoms were fever (58.0%) and cough (41.0%). The
mean age of symptomatic (36.3 year ±12.6SD) was significantly higher than that of
asymptomatic cases (34.5 year ±12.7SD). Compared to non-working populations, working in
public places (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11-2.80), healthcare settings (aOR, 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01-

4.31), or in aviation and tourism sector (aOR, 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14-4.40), were independently
associated with symptomatic state. Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was also
associated with symptomatic cases (aOR, 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-3.01). Compared to
asymptomatic, symptomatic COVID-19 cases had consistent odds of two or more of testing
positive to COVID-19 in three subsequent testing rounds.
Conclusions
A substantial proportion of the diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi Emirate was
asymptomatic. Quarantine of asymptomatic cases along with prevention measures and raising
awareness of populations working in high-risk settings is warranted. Further follow up
research is needed to understand viral clearance and clinical outcomes according to the
symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.(1)
Due to the sustained human-to-human transmission, rapidly, the COVID-19 has spread
globally to more than 215 countries affecting over 22 million people with over 777,680
deaths, as of August 16, 2020.(2) About 80% of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild,
15% are severe requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections requiring ventilation.(3)
Asymptomatic infection refers to the revealing of nucleic acid of the virus by reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in patient not showing typical clinical
symptoms.
One of the characteristics that has made COVID-19 pandemic difficult to control has been the
infectious status of those who are asymptomatic or very mild symptomatic.(3) Asymptomatic
COVID-19 infections have the same infectivity(4) and similar viral load as of symptomatic
infections.(5, 6) Contracting viral infection without showing clinical symptoms is highly
likely to occur in the event of close contact with confirmed cases. In Boston, 88% of the
COVID-19 positive cases were asymptomatic.(7) In Japan, 30.8% of Japanese citizens
evacuated from Wuhan were asymptomatic(8) and 51.7% of COVID-19 cases in the
“Diamond Princess” were also asymptomatic.(9) The viral RNA can be detected in the
respiratory secretions of asymptomatic patients for no less than 3-5 days.(5) Thus, a COVID19 mild or an asymptomatic case would have the potential of transmitting the virus to other
people without any awareness.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is described as a melting pot of cultures, with around 85%
of the population consisting of expatriates. UAE is burdened with a high prevalence of noncommunicable diseases mainly obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM),(10) which may
contribute to more susceptibility to the COVID-19. By August 07, 2020, there were over

61,845 COVID-19 cases and 354 deaths reported in the UAE,.(2) Mass active tracing and
testing contacts of COVID-19 cases along testing random samples from highly populated
residential areas have contributed dramatically in identifying more COVID-19 cases. Relative
to the total population, UAE is one of the top 10 countries in terms of the daily number of the
tested populations for the COVID-19.(2) In several reported studies, the prevalence of
asymptomatic COVID-19 positive cases ranged from 20% to 86% that are defined as
individuals with positive viral nucleic acid tests, but without any COVID-19 symptoms.(9,
11-13) To better understand the identified COVID-19 cases, we characterized COVID-19
cases, described factors associated with COVID-19 symptomatic state, and quantified the
strength of association between symptomatic state and repeated positivity in subsequent three
RT-PCR testing rounds during the disease course.
Materials and Methods
This study was approved by the Abu Dhabi Health COVID-19 Research Ethics Committee
(IRB DOH/CVDC/2020/1518). Owing to the retrospective analysis nature of the study,
patient’s informed consent was waived. This study followed and reported according to the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting
guideline.
Data source
We reviewed the first cohort of 1,249 COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases passively or
actively identified and reported to health authorities in the Abu Dhabi emirate up to April 08
2020. The first COVID-19 PCR confirmed case was reported on February 28 2020.
Information on the reported symptoms were recorded. Self-reported sociodemographics (age,
gender, nationality, place of work), chronic comorbidities (e.g. diabetes mellitus (DM),

hypertension, anemia, respiratory diseases), and travel history in the past month, were
collected.
Specimen collection and viral nucleic acid detection
Upper respiratory tract specimens were collected from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal
swabs by trained medical staffs. Viral genome detection was performed using RT-PCR
according to manufacturer instructions (BGI Genomics Co. Ltd). According to the local
health authorities’ guidelines for repeating testing positive cases, RT-PCR testing should be
repeated every 48-72 hours. After the first RT-PCR index test, information up to three
subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds was available for our COVID-19 cases.
Evidence synthesis
Outcomes of interest
The symptomatic state (presenting symptoms vs not presenting symptoms) of the COVID-19
confirmed cases.
Exposure variables
We categorized the COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases based on their symptomatic state
into asymptomatic or symptomatic (presented with at least one symptom). Age was
categorized into four age groups (≤20, 21–39, 40–59, or ≥60 years), to preserve sufficient
cases number in each sub-category, nationality regrouped into two sub-groups (Emirati and
non-Emirati). Place of work categorized into four sub-groups (not working, working in public
places, working in healthcare settings, or working in the aviation and tourism services). This
sub-categorization was based on the fact that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 and
developing symptoms could be associated to the frequency of being exposed to populations
with higher risk of transmitting the viral infection such as travelers from highly infected
areas. The “not working” category included housewives, children, visitors, and unemployed

people. The “working in public places” category included people working in shopping
markets or malls, delivery services, banks, barbershops, hotels, petrol stations, sales, police
and security sector, and taxi or bus drivers. Healthcare setting category included healthcare
staff (physicians, nurses, ambulance drivers, and para-medics), cleaners, and people working
in administrative positions (recipients and cashiers). Aviation and tourism services category
included people working in airports, travel agencies, and airport taxi and bus drivers.
The self-reported existence of chronic comorbidities (none or at least one chronic
comorbidity) and travel history in the past month (yes or no) each was dichotomized into two
subcategories.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as means with standard deviations (SD) and interquartile
range (IQR). Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and proportions. The mean
difference in continuous variables between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases
was compared using Student t-test. Difference in proportions of the measured categorical
variables between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases was assessed using the Chi-square
test.
Crude and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to quantify the strength
of association between the sociodemographic factors and the symptomatic state compared to
asymptomatic and the repeated positivity of RT-PCR in the subsequent three testing rounds,
among symptomatic compared to asymptomatic cases. Odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR
(aOR) with the 95% confidence intervals were estimated. To control for any potential
confounding effect, all measured exposure variables were included in the multivariable
model. Collinearity between exposure variables was investigated using the condition index

and the variance inflation factor (VIF). There was no collinearity. The maximum VIF value
was 1.3 while for the condition index it was 9.6.
The proportions of positive conversion by the symptomatic state were illustrated using
Kaplan-Meier plot and the log-rank test was used to determine the difference between the two
groups.
Statistical analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS software (version 26). A p-value
<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results
Profile of the COVID-19 cases
A total of 1,249 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases were investigated and reported to the
health authorities from February 28 to April 08, 2020. There was missing data on the
symptomatic state and other key characteristics in 458 cases. These cases were excluded from
the analysis. Among the remaining 791 cases, 43.5% were asymptomatic and 56.5% were
symptomatic cases (Fig 1).

Of the 447 symptomatic cases, 47.9% presented with only one symptom, 48.5% presented
with 2-3 symptoms, and 3.6% presented with four or more symptoms. The most frequent
symptoms were fever (58.0%) followed by cough (41.0%), sore throat (18.9%), and headache
fatigue (12.4%) (Fig 2).

The mean age of COVID-19 cases was 35.6 ±12.7 years. Majority of the cases were males
(79.2%), 57.6% were Asians, 61.7% were working in public places, 23.6% travelled abroad
in the past month, and 13.1% reported having at least one chronic comorbidity, mainly DM
(6.0%) and hypertension (5.7%).
Of the 791 COVID-19 cases, 388 (49.1%) were re-tested (second testing round) after an
average of 2.7 ±1.4 days from the first testing round. Of these 388 cases, 230 (59.3%) were
re-tested (third testing round) after an average of 2.4 ±1.2 days from the second testing round,
and of these 230 cases, 70.9% were re-tested (fourth PCR testing) after an average of 3.2 ±1.8

Symptomatic versus asymptomatic
The mean age of symptomatic was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases
(mean difference = 1.8 years, p=0.049). There were more symptomatic (35.1%) aged ≥40
years than asymptomatic cases (29.0%). There were significant differences in the frequency
distributions of the place of work between the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases
(p=0.006). More than two-thirds of symptomatic and asymptomatic (64.4% and 65.7%,
respectively) cases were working in public places. Among the COVID-19 cases working in
healthcare settings and aviation or tourism services, there were more symptomatic (19.7%)
compared to asymptomatic cases (12.9%). The proportion of symptomatic cases with at least
one chronic comorbidity was significantly higher than that of asymptomatic cases (16.7% vs
9.6%, respectively). In each of the three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds, the proportion of
testing positive to COVID-19 was substantially higher among symptomatic compared to
asymptomatic cases (Table 1).
Crude and independent factors associated with symptomatic state
The COVID-19 cases aged 40-59 years had 2.3-fold (95% CI: 1.23-4.34) higher odds to be
symptomatic. This association retained insignificant in the multivariable model. Compared to
“not working”, working in public places (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.11–2.80), in healthcare
setting (aOR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.01–4.31), or in aviation and tourism services (aOR: 2.24, 95%
CI: 1.14–4.40) was associated with a higher likelihood of having a symptomatic state.
Reporting at least one chronic comorbidity was associated with 1.76-time higher likelihood
of having symptomatic state (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03–3.01). Overall, working compared to

The findings described COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases according to their symptomatic
sate and identified sociodemographic characteristics associated with presenting symptoms in
COVID-19 patients. The study also quantified the strength of association between testing
positive in three subsequent RT-PCR testing rounds, after the first test. Elder ages, working,
or having at least one chronic comorbidity were independently associated with developing
symptoms to COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 cases were independently more likely to
test positive to COVID-19 after an average duration of 8.3 days from the first confirmatory
testing round.
The finding of 43.5% of the reported COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic is higher than the
previously reported asymptomatic proportion in Columbia (12.0%),(14) Diamond Princess
cruise in Japan (18.0%),(9) Republic of Korea (29.4%),(6) and Japanese evacuated from
Wuhan (31.0%).(8) The observed higher proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in the
UAE is merely attributed to the expanded active tracing and screening activities implemented
by health authorities. As an outbreak containment strategy, a large number of contacts of the
COVID-19 confirmed cases were traced and tested. The first reported two COVID-19
symptomatic cases on February 28, 2020 were for two members of an Italian cycling racing
team who had arrived to the UAE on February 20, 2020. For these two cases, a total of 693
individuals were traced and tested for COVID-19 within 1-2 days after identification. Contact
tracing and testing could detect a substantial number of potential silent transmitters. The mass
tracing and testing activities implemented by the health authorities in the UAE might have
contributed to the identification of large number of COVID-19 carriers while they are still in
the pre-symptomatic phase. Relative to the total population, UAE is one of the top countries
with regard to the total number of performed COVID-19 screening tests. By August 6th 2020,
over half (53.2%) of the total population in the UAE were tested for COVID-19.(2)

The crude finding of an inverse association between young age and presenting symptoms to
COVID-19 is consistent with a previous report.(15) Younger people are more likely to be
healthier with no underlying co-morbidities such as diabetes or hypertension. However, the
disappearance of this significant finding in the multivariate model is due to the confounding
effect of the “working status”. Younger populations are more likely to be engaged in incomeproducing activities rather than being retired or unemployed. In the present study, COVID-19
symptomatic state was associated with working in public places (e.g. petrol stations and
shopping malls), healthcare settings, or aviation and tourism sector (e.g. cabin crews and
airport taxi drivers). Exposure and repeated exposure to COVID-19 carriers are more likely to
occur in working places with more exposure to the public. Similarly, working in closed
spaces including healthcare settings or in aviation and tourism services potentially increases
the risk of exposure and re-exposure to the virus carriers such as confirmed patients and
international travelers. Re-exposure to more COVID-19 carriers or contaminated physical
services may have contributed to an increased level of the contracted viral load, which may
have expedited the symptomatic state.
COVID-19 positive cases with at least one chronic comorbidity were also positively
associated with symptomatic state. In our COVID-19 population, DM and hypertension were
the most frequent two chronic comorbidities. This observation is in line with other reports
that documented DM and hypertension as the most distinctive comorbidities in COVID-19
patients.(16-19) People with chronic comorbidities are more likely to be older in age and to
suffer from immune system impairments. DM patients suffer from a lack of energy supply to
immune cells that subsequently increases the virulence of infectious microorganisms.(20-22)
These impairments weaken the immune system response to microorganisms.(23)(24) Hence,
individuals with DM are more likely to be infected and are at a higher risk for complications
and death from COVID-19 and other pathogens including SARS and MERS,(17, 25-27) and

tuberculosis.(22) A recent study has discussed the mechanism by which DM modulates the
host-viral interactions and host-immune responses.(28) Following uptake of COVID-19 by
DM patients, the virus invades the respiratory epithelium and other target cells through
binding to cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and due to the impairment
of early recruitment and function of neutrophils and macrophages in DM patients, delay in
the initiation of adaptive immunity and dysregulation of the cytokine response may lead to
the initiation of cytokine storm that is associated with the symptomatic state and death among
DM patients. However, in patients with hypertension, antihypertensive drugs such as ACE
inhibitors and statins upregulate ACE2. Increased expressions of ACE2 may favor increased
cellular binding of COVID-19.(29-31). Hypertension and DM not only associated with
progressing to the symptomatic state, but also delay the viral clearance in COVID-19
patients.(32)
In our study, although the symptomatic state was associated with a delay in testing negative
in the subsequent testing rounds compared to asymptomatic cases, a substantial proportion of
asymptomatic cases were also tested positive. In the second RT-PCR testing round, after an
average of 2.7 days post the first test, almost three quarters (73.0%) while over a one-third
(35.1%), after an average of 8.3 days post the first test, of the asymptomatic COVID-19 cases
tested positive. This finding of paramount public health significance and implication related
to early screening, detection, and timing of quarantine of the asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.
Asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients were reported to have a similar viral
load after a median follow up time of 24 days from diagnosis.(6) Early screening and
detection of silent transmitters in the community along evidence-based quarantine timing
would positively contribute to controlling the role of silent transmitters on the current and
future pandemic waves.
Limitations and Strengths

Potentially, there are several limitations that should be practiced when interpreting our
findings. First, the collected information on the measured sociodemographic and medical
conditions was based on self-reports. This potentially may have introduced a risk of reporting
bias that could have underestimated or overestimated our findings. However, this is less
likely to occur as all the data was collected by trained healthcare staff who are familiar with
data collection and with the definition of chronic comorbidities. Second, categorization of the
COVID-19 cases into the symptomatic and asymptomatic state without further categorization
into a mild, moderate, severe, or critical state. This was because of the lack of other clinical
parameters that are necessary for such categorization. However, performing further analysis
according to the number of symptoms (asymptomatic, one symptom, 2-3 symptoms, and ≥4
symptoms) was consistent with current findings apart from the significant reduction in the
power of the obtained estimates (data not shown). Another important limitation that would
potentially further limit the generalizability of our findings is the substantial proportion
(36.7%) of missing data on the symptomatic state of COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, to
exclude the potential effect of the missing data, the COVID-19 cases included in this analysis
were similar to those with missing data, according to the measured exposure variables except
for the number of chronic comorbidities. This difference in the proportion of COVID-19
cases with at least one medical condition could be explained by the observed large proportion
of missing data on the self-reported medical conditions of the excluded cases. Also, there was
no information on the number of pre-symptomatic patients who subsequently developed
symptoms during observation. Finally, all the included studies relied on RT-PCR testing
without further investigation using chest computed tomography (CT) imaging. The effect of
this could be bi-directional, either overestimation or underestimation, as some cases might
have been missed due to false negative result, or some cases might have been included due to
the false positive testing to COVID-19.(33, 34)

Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize
COVID-19 positive cases in the UAE according to the symptomatic state and to shed light on
the strength of association between sociodemographic characteristics and chronic
comorbidities with symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, our study was
based on data collected by trained personal using a standardized data collection and RT-PCR
testing procedure. Our study also provided empirical evidence on the positive association
between symptomatic state and delay in testing negative compared to asymptomatic COVID19 cases.
Conclusions
A substantial proportion of the COVID-19 cases in the Abu Dhabi emirate identified between
February 28 and April 08, 2020 was asymptomatic. Working in settings with a higher
likelihood of exposure and re-exposure to confirmed or potential virus carriers, or suffering
from at least one chronic comorbidity, were independently positively associated with the
symptomatic state of the COVID-19 cases. The estimated proportion of asymptomatic cases
is a vital parameter for future studies while the estimated strength of association between
identified exposures and the symptomatic state and between testing positive in further RTPCR testing rounds is vital for public health prevention and control interventions. Further
follow up cohort studies are needed to have more insight about viral clearance and clinical
outcomes in COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.
