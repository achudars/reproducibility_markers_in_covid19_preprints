How human respiratory physiology and the transport phenomena associated with the inhaled airflow
therein proceed to impact transmission of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the initial infection, is an open question. An answer can help determine the susceptibility of an individual on exposure to a COVID-2019 carrier and can also quantify the still-unknown infectious dose for the disease. Synergizing computational
fluid mechanics enabled tracking of respiratory transport in medical imaging-based anatomic domains,
with sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and earlier measurements of ejecta
size distribution during regular speech – this study shows that the regional deposition of virus-laden
inhaled droplets at the initial nasopharyngeal infection sites peaks for the droplet size range of 2.5 – 19
microns, and reveals that the number of virions that go on to establish the infection can be merely in the
order of hundreds.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the causative agent for
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), that has inflicted a global pandemic with nearly 34 million confirmed
infections and over 1 million deaths worldwide, as of late-September 2020; for details, see1 .
As is well-known by now, transmission of respiratory infections such as COVID-19 occurs through carriage of
pathogens via droplets of different sizes produced during sneezing, coughing, singing, normal speech, and even,
breathing2 . Accordingly, the means of person-to-person infection are projected to be three-way3 : (a) inhalation of
virus-laden droplets emitted by an infected individual at close-range; (b) inhalation of vaporized droplet nuclei that
can float in air for hours; and (c) contaminating the respiratory mucosa through physical contact to external surfaces
(fomites) with droplet deposits sitting on them. While (a) is valid for short-distance exposures to the COVID-19
carrier, transmission through modes (b) and (c) can happen over larger distances and longer time scales. However,
clustering trends of infection spread (e.g. in industrial units4 , in closed groups5 , and inside households6 ) suggest that
close-range exposures can be a critical determinant in worsening the pandemic. A follow-up question might be –
what entails an exposure? A key component therein are the respiratory droplet sizes one is exposed to. Coughing
and sneezing typically generate droplets with length-scales of O(102 ) to O(103 ) µ, while oral droplets ejected
during normal speaking can range over ∼ 0.1 − 500 µ 3, 7 . The main competing effects determining the fate of these
droplets are the ambient temperature and humidity (e.g. low relative humidity induces fast evaporation and shrinkage
of the droplets), and the size of the droplet that controls its inertia and the gravitational force acting on it. While
smaller droplets would stay airborne for longer, the larger droplets tend to fall fast ballistically; with the critical size
for this transition being in the vicinity of 100 µ 8, 9 . Of note here, this study does not insist on any nomenclatural
distinction between “aerosols” and “droplets” owing to ambiguities10 in common perception, and simply refers to all

expiratory liquid particulates as droplets.
For tracking what range of virus-bearing droplet sizes might be more potent for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and
to eventually induce infection, it is key that we identify the initial infection sites. At least two recent studies11, 12
reveal a striking pattern of relatively high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in ciliated epithelial cells along the nasal passage
lining in the upper airway, to less infectivity in cells lining the throat and bronchia, and finally to relatively low
infectivity at the lung cells. The trend is decidedly governed through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2),
which is a single-pass type I membrane protein and is the surface receptor that the virus utilizes to intrude into
cells. ACE2 is abundant on ciliated epithelial cells, but is relatively scarce on the surface of the lower airway cells.
While these findings are for in vitro samples, deposition of virus-laden droplets along the anterior nasal airway might
not be so effective as to launch an infection despite the presence of ciliated cells, since the mucus layer provides
some protection against virus invasion and infection3 . This sets up nasopharynx (i.e. the region in the upper airway
posterior to the septum and comprising the superior portion of the pharynx; for reference, see Figure 1, Panel A) as
the main initial infection site; it acts as the seeding zone for subsequent infection of the lower airway via aspiration
of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. The ansatz is supported by the efficacy13 of nasopharyngeal swab
testing for COVID-19 diagnosis, when compared to oropharyngeal swabs. So at this point, a valid question to ask
would be: what are the dominant inhaled droplet sizes that are making their way to the nasopharynx?
Respiratory droplets, on being expelled, typically lose water and shrink; – the extent of which partially depends
on the fraction of non-volatile constituents present in the droplets, e.g. dehydrated epithelial cell remnants, white
blood cells, enzymes, DNA, sugars, electrolytes etc. So, although sputum is composed of 99.5% water; ejected
droplets, on dehydration, have a higher density of 1.3 g/ml14 , which is what has been used for droplet tracking
simulations here. This considers that the non-volatile weight fraction is in the 1 – 5% range. Such dehydration
contracts the expelled droplet diameter to 27 – 34% of the initial size. Thus, for a mean 30% shrinkage and
considering 100 µ as the critical size prompting ballistic sedimentation, this study tracks inhaled droplet sizes in the
range of 0.1 µ to 30% of 100 µ, i.e. 30 µ. Choice of the smallest tracked droplet size is dictated by SARS-CoV-2
dimension, which is in between 0.08 – 0.2 µ, with an average physical diameter of 0.1 µ 15 .
Next piece in this puzzle relates to the breathing parameters. Allometric relations16 put the minute inhalation at
18.20 L/min for a 75-kg male and 15.05 L/min for a 75-kg female, for gentle steady breathing while sitting awake.
In general, inspiratory rates can stretch over ∼15 – 85 L/min, based on whether the individual is inhaling gently or
breathing in forcefully. This study simulates droplet transmission at four different inhalation rates, viz. 15, 30, 55,
and 85 L/min; notably these discrete flow rates are the ones traditionally used17 for checking filtration capacities
of protective face-coverings and respirators. The flow physics undergo a transition over this range; e.g. 15 L/min
through nasal conduits is in laminar regime, the transport mechanism however devolves into turbulence at higher
inhalation rates.

Methods
Anatomic geometry reconstruction
Computed tomography (CT)-based in silico model generation was accomplished according to relevant guidelines
and regulations, with the anatomic geometries being reconstructed from existing de-identified imaging data from
two CT-normal subjects. The use of the archived and anonymized medical records was approved with exempt status
by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, with the requirement
of informed consent being waived for retrospective use of the de-identified scans in computational research. The
test subjects include a 61 year-old female (subject for anatomic reconstruction 1, or AR1) and a 37 year-old female
(subject for anatomic reconstruction 2, or AR2). In context to the imaging resolution, the CT slices were collected
at coronal depth increments of ∼ 0.4 mm. The nasal airspaces were extracted from the medical grade scans over
a delineation range of -1024 to -300 Hounsfield units, and was complemented by careful hand-editing of the
selected pixels to ensure anatomic accuracy. For this step, the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications
in Medicine) scans for each subject were imported to the image processing software Mimics 18.0 (Materialise,

Plymouth, Michigan).
The reconstructed geometries were imported as stereolithography files to ICEM-CFD 15.0 (ANSYS, Inc.,
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania), and then meshed spatially into minute volume elements. Conforming with established
mesh refinement-based protocols18, 19 , each computational grid contained more than 4 million unstructured, graded
tetrahedral elements (e.g. 4.54 million in AR1, 4.89 million in AR2); along with three prism layers of 0.1-mm
thickness at the airway walls, with a height ratio of 1. The nostril inlet planes comprised 3015 elements in AR1
(1395 elements on left nostril plane, 1620 elements on right nostril plane) and 3000 elements in AR2 (1605 on left
nostril plane, 1395 on right nostril plane).
Numerical simulations
The study considers droplet transport for four different inhaled airflow rates, viz. 15, 30, 55, and 85 L/min. The
lower flow rate (i.e. 15 L/min) corresponds to comfortable resting breathing, with the viscous-laminar steady-state
flow physics model standing in as a close approximation20–31 . At higher flow rates (extreme values of which
may sometimes lead to nasal valve collapse), the shear layer separation from the tortuous walls of the anatomic
geometries results in turbulence32–35 . While accounting for the turbulent characteristics of the ambient airflow, the
study averages the droplet deposition percentages from implementation of two distinct categories of numerical
schemes, viz. (a) shear stress transport (SST) based k-ω model, which is a sub-class under Reynolds-averaged
Navier Stokes (RANS) schemes that parameterize the action of all turbulent fluctuations on to the mean flow; and (b)
Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The two numerical techniques depict high correlation in terms of droplet deposition
at the nasopharynx (as will be discussed through Figure 1). However, it should be noted that while the SST k-ω
scheme, a 2-equation eddy-viscosity model, is computationally less expensive; it averages the short time-scale flow
artifacts, such as the transient vortices (e.g. the low-pressure Dean’s vortices that are common in tortuous channels
and can act as droplet attractors); and hence the prediction of droplet transport affected by the simulated ambient
airflow may at times contain errors. LES is computationally more expensive, it separates the turbulent flow into
large-scale and small-scale motions, and accounts for the small fluctuations through a sub-grid scale model (in this
study, Kinetic Energy Transport Model was used as the sub-grid scale model36 ). We took the averaged estimates for
regional droplet deposition (along the in silico nasal tissue surfaces) from the two schemes, to minimize probable
statistical and algorithmic biases.
The computational schemes implemented in the meshed domains employed a segregated solver on ANSYS Fluent,
with SIMPLEC pressure-velocity coupling and second-order upwind spatial discretization. Solution convergence
was monitored by minimizing the mass continuity and velocity component residuals, and through stabilizing the
mass flow rate and static pressure at the airflow outlets. For the pressure-driven flow solutions: typical convergence
run-time for a laminar simulation with 5000 iterations was approximately 5–6 hours for 4-processor based parallel
computations executed at 4.0 GHz speed. The corresponding run-time for a RANS simulation was ∼ 12 hours; for
an LES computation, it was 4–5 days. Note that for the LES work, the simulated flow interval was 0.5 second for the
30 L/min case, with 0.0002 second as the time-step37 and it was 0.25 second for the 55 and 85 L/min flow rates with
the time-step at 0.0001 second. In the computations, assumed air density was 1.204 kg/m3 and 1.825 × 10−5 kg/m.s
was used as dynamic viscosity of air.
Following set of boundary conditions were enforced during the simulations: (i) zero velocity at the airway-tissue
interface i.e. at the walls enclosing the digitized nasal airspace (otherwise commonly referred to as the no slip
condition), along with “trap” boundary condition for droplets whereby a droplet would come to rest after depositing
on the walls; (ii) zero pressure at nostril planes, which were the pressure-inlet zones in the simulations, with “reflect”
boundary condition for droplets to mimic the effect of inhalation on the droplet trajectories if they are about to fall
out of the anterior nasal domain; and (iii) a negative pressure at the airflow outlet plane, which was the pressure-outlet
zone, with “escape” boundary condition for droplets, i.e. allowing for the outgoing droplet trajectories to leave the
upper respiratory airspace. Mean inlet-to-outlet pressure gradients were -9.01 Pa at 15 L/min, -26.65 Pa at 30 L/min,
-73.73 Pa at 55 L/min, and -155.93 Pa at 85 L/min. For a reference on the general layout of the anatomic regions, see
Panel A in Figure 1.
On convergence of the airflow simulations, inhaled droplet dynamics were tracked by Lagrangian-based discrete

phase inert particle transport simulations in the ambient airflow; with the localized deposition along the airway walls
obtained through numerically integrating transport equations38 that consider contribution of the airflow field on the
evolution of droplet trajectories, along with the effects for gravity and other body forces such as the Saffman lift
force that is exerted by a flow-shear field on small particulates moving transverse to the streamwise direction. Also,
the droplet size range is considered large enough to discount Brownian motion effects on their spatial dynamics.
Note that the study simulated the transport for 3015 droplets of each size in AR1 and 3000 droplets of each size in
AR2, the numbers being same as the number of elements on the nostril inlet planes which were seeded with the
to-be-tracked droplets for the droplet transport simulations. For the numerical tracking, the initial mass flow rate of
the inert droplets moving normal to the inlet planes into the nasal airspace was required to be non-zero, and was set
at 10−20 kg/s. After the transport simulations, the post-processing of the droplet transmission data along the airway
walls provided the regional deposition trends at the nasopharynx.
The numerical methods, discussed and used here, are a significant extension from one of our recent publications38
in this journal. The questions explored in the present study are, of course, very different and new, and the findings
can be potentially substantial in our evolving field of knowledge on COVID-19. The reader should also note that
the numeric protocol has been rigorously validated in the earlier publication38 , through comparing the regional
deposition trends along the inner walls of similar in silico nasal anatomic domains to the in vitro spray tests performed
in 3D-printed solid replicas of the same reconstructions. One may additionally refer to another recent publication22
for more details on the digital reconstruction and meshing techniques.
Estimating virion contamination in respiratory ejecta
Suppose the viral load in a COVID-19 carrier has been assessed to be V copies of RNA in each ml of sputum fluid.
Let a representative expelled droplet diameter from the carrier be D µ. With SARS-CoV-2 being a single-stranded
RNA virus, the average number of virions embedded in each droplet can then be computed as (π/6)V D3 × 10−12 .
Therefore, every 100 droplets of the same size would have (π/6)V D3 × 10−10 virions; which, in other words,
represents the probability (in %) for a droplet of diameter D µ, of containing at least 1 virion.
The study also calculates the number of virions that are depositing at the nasopharynx in unit time. From
computational tracking of droplet transport, we can figure out the deposition efficiency of droplets of each size; let
the averaged nasopharyngeal deposition efficiency be η (in %) for droplets of diameter D µ. That implies: for every
100 inhaled D-µ droplets, η of them are landing on the nasopharynx. Now, if n number of such droplets are being
ejected by the carrier per minute, then for a closely-positioned individual – the number of D-µ droplets depositing
per minute at the nasopharynx is N = n × η/100. Therefore for a viral load of V copies of RNA per ml; the number
of virions per minute, that are transmitted to the nasopharynx by the D-µ droplets, is (πN/6)V D3 × 10−12 .

Results
Droplet size range that targets the nasopharynx.
The overall droplet size range of 2.5 – 19 µ (in AR1: 2.5 – 19 µ, in AR2: 2.5 – 15 µ) registers the peak, in terms of
the percentage of droplets of each size that are deposited at the nasopharynx. The range is determined by a cut-off of
at least 5% deposition for around 3000 tracked droplets (viz. 3015 in AR1, 3000 in AR2) of each size. Panel B in
Figure 1 displays the heat-maps for nasopharyngeal deposition (NPD) for different droplet sizes, during inhalation at
the four tested airflow rates. The discrete droplet sizes, that were tracked, have been marked along the horizontal axis
of the heat-maps. The patch bounded by the grey lines can, in fact, be a definitive graphical technique to delineate
the hazardous droplet size range for various airborne transmissions.
Note that these findings assume that the post-dehydration density of the respiratory droplets (expelled by the
carrier and now being inhaled by the exposed individual) is at 1.3 g/ml. If there is little or no dehydration and as
such the ejected droplet density remains at ∼1 g/ml, the inhaled droplet size range for peak NPD upscales to 3 – 20
µ (results available in the online data repository39 ); since the slightly lighter droplets can now penetrate further into
the intranasal airspace, the transport process being aided by the ambient inspiratory streamlines.

with an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.98 for 30 L/min, 0.93 for 55 L/min, and 0.95 for 85 L/min.
Subsequent check of the slope m for the linear best-fit trendline, through the scatter plots of RANS and LES-based
NPD data, indicates how similar the estimates are quantitatively; the mean measures therein being m = 1.113 for 30
L/min, m = 1.052 for 55 L/min, and m = 1.177 for 85 L/min; with the value 1 signifying exact equivalence. The
statistical operations were carried out on Wolfram Mathematica.
While using a previously reported7 ejecta size distribution, the study divides up the percentages for each size bin
(i.e. 0–5, 5–10, 10–15 µ etc.) uniformly and apportions them to the discrete droplet sizes (belonging to the same
size bin) that are tracked (see horizontal axis between the NPD heat-maps in Panel B, Figure 1), to estimate how
many droplets of each size would be ejected by the carrier during unit time. The referenced article7 described the
size bin limits as A − B; for consistency, this study interpreted that as droplet sizes (in µ) that are ≥ A and < B.
Also at this point, to think of a realistic exposure to a COVID-19 carrier, the vulnerable individual can be
considered to inhale at different airflow rates over the duration of exposure. In such context, the Panel A in Figure 2
extracts the averaged nasopharyngeal deposition for the different tested inhalation rates in the two test subjects.
Such inhalation-averaged transmission presents an approximate dehydrated droplet size range of 2.5 – 15.0 µ, for a
minimum 2% NPD for each droplet size.

Droplets that are better at carrying the virions.
The next pertinent question is: how effective are these droplets at carrying virions? SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a
family of single-stranded RNA viruses, and virological assessments40 done on the sputum of hospitalized COVID-19
patients show an averaged viral load of 7 × 106 RNA copies/ml of oral fluid, with the peak load being 2.35 × 109
copies/ml. For the average load, simple calculations (see methods) show that the probability that a dehydrated 10-µ
droplet (contracted from its original size of ∼ 33 µ) will carry at least 1 virion is 13.6%. The same number is 45.8%
for a post-shrinkage 15-µ droplet. The probability drops exponentially to 0.2% for a 2.5-µ dehydrated droplet. Now,
with existing data on the size distribution of expelled droplets during normal speaking (see Panel B, Figure 2), the
proportion of virion deposits at the nasopharynx by different droplet sizes can be computed (see Panel C, Figure 2)
by using the transmission data presented in Figure 1. The deposition trends are again for droplets that are being
inhaled post-dehydration.
Conspicuously enough: in the absence of environmental dehydration, the probability of 1 virion being embedded
in, for instance, a 10-µ droplet plummets to 0.37% (see Panel D, Figure 2). This rationalizes why in geographic
regions with high humidity (and hence relatively less dehydration and shrinkage of respiratory ejecta), the pandemic’s
spread has been somewhat measured41, 42 .

219

What could be COVID-19’s infectious dose?
The infectious dose is a fundamental virological measure quantifying the number of virions that can go on to start an
infection; the value of which is still not conclusively known for SARS-CoV-243 . Theoretically, according to the
independent action hypothesis44 , even a single virion can potentially establish an infection in highly susceptible
systems. Whether the hypothesis is true for humans and specifically for SARS-CoV-2 transmission is as yet
undetermined. The rapid spread of COVID-19 though a priori suggests a small infective dose for the disease, that is
triggering inter-human transmission.
Since it is unethical to expose subjects to SARS-CoV-2 (especially in the absence of well-evidenced remediating
therapeutics – as of September 2020), this study introduces a novel strategy synergizing computational tracking and
virological data, to quantify the infectious dose. Based on the nasopharyngeal transmission trends (Figure 1) and the
virion transmission data (Panels B-C of Figure 2), for a 5-minute exposure: the number of virions depositing at the
susceptible individual’s nasopharynx is 11, considering average RNA load in the carrier’s sputum. On the contrary,
if the infecting individual is in the disease phase with peak RNA load, as many as 3835 virions will be deposited on
the nasopharynx of the exposed individual over 5 minutes (see Panel E in Figure 2).

To derive a simple order-of-magnitude estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 infectious dose, consider the March 2020 Skagit
Valley Chorale superspreading incident5 , where a COVID-19 carrier infected 52 other individuals in a 61-member
choir group. Exposure time there was reported to be 2.5 hours. The subjects were situated close to each other; which
justifies ignoring the effect of spatial ventilation for a conservative estimate of the number of virions a susceptible
individual would have been exposed to. Consequently, for an average RNA load (assuming that the carrier had
mild-to-moderate symptoms), the number of virions depositing at a closely-positioned individual’s nasopharynx over
that duration approximates to (11/5) × 2.5 × 60 ≈ 330. So, ∼ 300 can be reckoned as a conservative upper estimate
for COVID-19’s infective dose, the order agreeing with preliminary estimates from replication rates of the virus45 .
One could raise several caveats though; the calculation parameters (especially related to the indoor airflow
and ventilation rates, probable spatial fluctuations, and the subject-specific variables associated with the Skagit
Valley incident), being used to reach the above estimate for infectious dose, are not, as of now, substantiated by an
epidemiological model. The study’s cross-disciplinary strategy (combining numerical simulations of transport in
complex anatomic pathways with virological assessments and respiratory ejecta data) could however be potentially
used as a sub-component of an epi-model; for an exact quantification of parameters such as the viral infectious dose.

Discussion

260

Through tissue culture examinations for respiratory infections, it is fairly well recognized46 that only a small fraction
of virions are actually able to infect a human cell, and that this fraction decreases rapidly with increasing duration
from the time of initial infection of the carrier. So, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is being conjectured to peak well
before the viral load reaches a maximum. This substantiates the use of averaged viral load in the carrier’s sputum for
the virological calculations, while deducing the conservative upper estimate for the SARS-CoV-2 infectious dose.
In this study, whereas the computed data is post-processed to specifically extract the droplet sizes that tend to
target the nasopharynx, a vastly larger remainder (comprising predominantly the droplets that are smaller than 5
µ) actually go further down the respiratory tract (considering that the air passageways narrow down to just a few
microns in the lower airway). However, the significantly larger surface area of the lower airspaces, coupled with the
scarcity of ACE2 receptors there, validates the robustness of the modeling framework i.e. focusing on the droplets
that deposit on the ACE2-rich epithelial cells at the nasopharynx. Also, the probability of droplets smaller than 5
µ to carry a virion is often insignificant; e.g. the probability of containing a virion is only around 1.7% for a 5-µ
droplet.
Note here that the mathematical approach on the estimation of virion contamination in the respiratory ejecta
has, by the very nature of it, presumed a simplistic estimate of viral load in the ejected droplets, based on a
continuum-based argument that the spatial distribution of virions could be considered uniform in the sputum. In
reality, how the complex rheology of oral fluids might affect the ejecta generation and subsequent break-down,
and the resultant volumetric concentration of virions embedded in the expiratory remnants – are also critical open
questions.
Finally, this study is limited by the small sample size, primarily owing to the lack of CT scans in subjects
with otherwise disease-free airways. To get a realistic insight on the intranasal transport phenomena at the onset
of any respiratory infection, it is preferred that we base the in silico cavity reconstructions on CT-normal images.
Nonetheless, the preliminary findings presented here could be considered an important step in the mechanistic
characterization of the transmission dynamics for inhaled pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2.

That the number of virions needed to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection can be of O(102 ) is indeed remarkable! The
low order underlines how highly communicable this disease is, especially if discerned in the perspective of the
infectious doses for other airborne transmissions, e.g. the infective dose for influenza A virus, when administered
through aerosols to human subjects lacking serum neutralizing antibodies, is at least an order greater and ranges
between 1950 – 3000 virions47 .
To summarize: (a) the estimate for the still-elusive infectious dose for COVID-19, together with (b) this study’s
rigorous detection of the hazardous inhaled droplet sizes (2.5 – 19 µ) that specifically target the infection-prone
nasopharynx, can provide a key resource in mitigating the pandemic. For example, the information on the droplet
sizes that tend to launch the initial infection at the nasopharynx could be utilized to inform public policy on social
distancing and in the design of novel masks and face coverings that can screen such droplet sizes and yet be more
breathable than the mask respirators that are available now. The findings can also quite significantly provide inputs
for the mechanistic design of topical anti-viral therapeutics48–50 and targeted intranasal vaccines51, 52 , that would be
tailored to land on the infected nasopharynx thereby generating a broader therapeutic window than systemically
administered drugs.
