Abstract
Importance: New York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a
significant number of individuals infected by the virus. Patients with multiple myeloma
have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma
therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management.
Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple
myeloma.
Design: Case-series.
Setting: Five large academic centers in New York City.
Participants: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who
were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020.
Exposures: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of
COVID-19.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression
were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care
unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death.
Results: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58%; median age 68, range 41-91)
diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74%) were admitted; of these 13 (18%) patients were
placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24%) expired. None of the studied
risk factors were significantly associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICUadmission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3-3.2); age

>65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem
cell transplant <12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG<650 mg/dL (N=42)
OR=1.2 (95% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders,
hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95% CI
1.5-8.1).
Conclusions and Relevance: Although multiple myeloma patients have a
compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest
disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19,
compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be
shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality
rates.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a global
health crisis since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1 COVID-19
has so far caused over 400,000 deaths globally and has spread to the majority of
countries around the world.2 New York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak and a significant number of individuals have been infected by the virus,
including both patients with underlying health conditions as well as healthy individuals.3
Clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headaches, and
shortness of breath.1 They range from mild symptoms to severe disease characterized
by pneumonia, hypoxia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS),
immune dysregulation, cytokine storm, thromboembolic events, and multiorgan failure.1
Reported risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease are male gender, advanced age,
smoking, and certain comorbidities such as hypertension.1,4

Five studies of varying size have suggested that patients with cancer on active therapy
or recent surgery had a higher risk of a more severe COVID-19 disease course.5-9
Additionally, recent immunotherapy treatment with checkpoint inhibitors was associated
with a poorer outcome.7 Patients with multiple myeloma have an inherently
compromised humoral and cellular immunity from the malignant plasma cell disorder
itself and its associated hypogammaglobulinemia.10 The immunosuppression seen at
presentation can be exacerbated by the standard combination anti-myeloma therapies
currently in use.11 Among the conventional treatment options for multiple myeloma, the
use of high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant

is particularly associated with acute and sustained hypogammaglobulinemia and T-cell
suppression.12 Here, we report on the largest experience to date from a cohort of
multiple myeloma patients with COVID-19 from five large academic centers in New York
City.

Methods
Consecutive patients with multiple myeloma and related precursor diseases,
hospitalized as well as outpatients, were included in this study. Participating centers
are: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (N=52), New York University Langone
Health (N=30), Mount Sinai (N=23), Weill Cornell Medicine (N=13), and Columbia
University Medical Center (N=9). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed using
real time polymerase chain reaction through nasopharynx swab. Patients with confirmed
COVID-19 during the peak of the outbreak between March 10th and April 30th, 2020
were included in this cohort study.

We obtained data on patient characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory findings,
treatments, and outcomes. In addition to descriptive statistics, logistic regression was
used to estimate risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. Taking this approach,
we estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary
composite end-point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical
ventilation, or death. Hypogammaglobulinemia was defined as immunoglobulin G (IgG)
levels <650 mg/dL (lower limit of normal), and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was

defined as IgG levels <400 mg/dL. Separate analyses were performed for patients with
multiple myeloma (N=100) and for all patients with plasma cell disorders (N=127).

Results
We identified a total of 100 patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19. Median age
at the time of COVID-19 infection was 68 years (range 41-91 years). Fifty-eight (58%) of
the patients were male and 24 were current or former smokers (Table 1). Concomitant
cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidities were seen in 74 patients of which
hypertension was the most common (56%). Additionally, 27 patients with related plasma
cell disorders; 20 with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
and 3 with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), 3 patients with AL amyloidosis, and 1
patient with solitary plasmacytoma, were identified (Table 1).

Of the 100 patients with multiple myeloma, 28 patients (28%) had newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma; 26 were being treated with induction therapy, one had not yet started
induction and one had chosen not to start therapy. There were 35 (35%) patients with
stable disease (i.e. non-active disease); 23 of these were on lenalidomide maintenance,
5 were on other forms of maintenance including ixazomib/dexamethasone and
daratumumab/dexamethasone and 7 patients with stable disease were monitored off
therapy. Thirty-five (35%) patients had relapse/refractory multiple myeloma of which 31
were on various treatments for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; the majority
daratumumab- or carfilzomib-based. The remaining 4 relapse/refractory patients were
not on active anti-myeloma therapy due to advance disease stage (hospice) or other

more pressing comorbidities. Information on treatment status was missing for two
patients, these were both classified as newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.(Table 2)
Overall, a total of 39 patients had undergone high-dose melphalan followed by
autologous stem cell transplant; 7 patients within the 12 months prior to contracting
COVID-19. Two patients had a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant several years before
the COVID-19 diagnosis. (Table 2) Forty-two patients (42%) had hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <650 mg/dL) and 18 patients (18%) had severe
hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <400 mg/dL).

The laboratory findings in this multiple myeloma cohort revealed lymphopenia and
elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels. (Table 3) Patients who
met the adverse combined endpoint (i.e. ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or
death) had overall higher levels of inflammatory markers reflecting a more severe
infection and cytokine activation.

Of the 100 patients with multiple myeloma and a SARS-CoV-2 positive RNA PCR test
on this study, 74 (74%) were admitted due to COVID-19; 16 were admitted to the ICU
and 13 of these patients were placed on mechanical ventilation. Regarding treatments
used for COVID-19, 52 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine and 52 with
azithromycin, 42 had the combination of the two and 35 received neither
hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin. (Table 4) Nine patients received treatment with
IL-6 inhibitors, tocilixumab or sarilumab, and one patient was treated with the IL-1
inhibitor anakinra and the TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab. Other treatments included high

dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and investigational anti-viral therapies such
as lopinavir-ritonavir and remdesivir. Two patients were treated with convalescent
plasma. Eighteen of the multiple myeloma patients, thus 24% of those admitted, expired
during the follow-up time.

Twenty-seven patients (27%) of the 100 multiple myeloma patients met the combined
adverse end-point (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death) and the risk was
highest for patients with hypertension. None of the studied risk factors were significantly
associated (P>0.05) with adverse outcomes, including hypertension, OR 2.3 (95% CI
0.9-5.9); diabetes, OR 1.1 (95% CI 0.3-3.2); age >65 years, OR 2.0 (95% CI 0.8-5.3), or
male gender, OR 0.9 (95% CI 0.4-2.1). Based on small numbers (N=7), patients who
received high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed with autologous stem cell
transplant within 12 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were not significantly
associated with the adverse combined endpoint, OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.2-7.4). Also, we did
not observe any statistical association between the adverse combined endpoint and
hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <650 mg/dL); OR 0.9 (95% CI 0.3-2.5) or severe
hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG <400 mg/dL); and 1.2 (95% CI 0.4-4.2), respectively.
(Table 5)

In the entire case series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, the OR of severe
outcome (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death) was significantly elevated for
those with hypertension (OR 3.4, 95% 1.5-8.1) while diabetes, male gender, age >65

Discussion
COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus where, in the general
population, the most severe outcomes are observed among elderly patients and
patients with cardiovascular comorbidities.3,13 There is limited data on outcomes in
patients with cancers particularly patients with hematological malignancies. Here, we
present the first large case series of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma, a
plasma cell malignancy associated with a compromised immune system, due to both
disease biology and anti-myeloma therapies. Consecutive patients with multiple
myeloma and related precursor diseases with confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2
between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 from five large academic centers in New York
City were included in this study. In the general population, the probability of dying from
COVID-19 has been reported to be between 0.5-3% including all COVID-19 positive
patients, and between 6-30% for hospitalized patients due to the virus.1,3,13-16 Here, we
show that among 74 multiple myeloma patients admitted due to COVID-19, the mortality
rate was 24% which thus is in the higher range of what has been reported in the general
population.

We were motivated to better understand risk factors associated with severe outcomes
from COVID-19 positive multiple myeloma patients. Specifically, we studied host
characteristics as well as available variables related to the disease and treatment.

Similar to reports from the general population, we found more men than women
diagnosed with COVID-19 in this series, and there was a tendency towards a higher OR
for adverse outcome (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death) in patients with
hypertension. In the analysis of the entire series of COVID-19 positive patients with
multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders (N=127), similar to the general
population, cardiovascular risk factors were significantly associated with adverse
outcome.3 Independent of COVID-19, typically, patients with multiple myeloma are at an
increased risk of infections due to both disease and treatment associated
immunosuppression.17 Examples of these associations are the immunomodulatory and
conventional chemotherapy drugs which cause myelosuppression, the targeted
monoclonal antibodies such as anti-CD-38 associated with suppression of the humoral
immune system.18-22 In the current series, we did not identify an association between
hypogammaglobulinemia and adverse outcome; however, due to the lack of detailed
biomarker data, we were unable to rule out associations involving other immunological
mechanisms (such as T-cell suppression) that are important in the immune response
towards viral and other infections. In multiple myeloma patients undergoing high-dose
melphalan chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant, it is well-known
that there are severe acute as well as sustained long-term immunosuppression
including broad aspects of the immune system.23,24 In this study, 39 of the 100 multiple
myeloma patients included had been treated with autologous stem cell transplant, 7
within the 12 months prior to contracting SARS-CoV-2. Based on small numbers (N=7),
the OR for the adverse combined end-point was not significantly elevated in patients
who had high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell

transplant within 12 months prior to contracting COVID-19. Despite not seeing an
increased mortality associated with high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed by
autologous stem cell transplant, we note the concerns of the American Society of
Hematology as well as the International Myeloma Society whose recommendations
state that for transplant-eligible patients, high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed
with autologous stem cell transplant should be postponed, if possible, until the
pandemic abates.25,26 Given that it is unknown whether there could be additional
seasonal outbreaks in upcoming winter of 2020 as well as following years, it is good
clinical practice to have this discussion with every patient. When a safe and efficacious
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine becomes available, it should be recommended to multiple
myeloma patients and should be added to re-immunization programs for melphalaninduced inactivation of prior vaccines.

To minimize the risk for exposure, management of multiple myeloma including the use
of infusions, injections and oral drugs has been adjusted to favor fewer visits, fewer
injections/infusions and a preference for oral drugs.25-31 All five academic centers limited
the use of high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant and only a few high
risk patients have been transplanted during the outbreak. Additionally, in our
experience, patients with multiple myeloma have been particularly adherent to the
general recommendations for social distancing.32,33 This may have contributed to the
relatively low number of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19 in this cohort
given the population of New York City (8.4 million), the overall number of confirmed

cases (>200,000), and the large catchment area covered by the five included hospital
centers.

In prior reports from the general population, the immune response in patients with
severe COVID-19 show a unique pattern with high IL-6, low HLA-DR expression, and
dysregulation of lymphocytes characterized by CD4 lymphopenia and subsequently Bcell lymphopenia.34 In the current series of multiple myeloma patients, we found high
levels of IL-6, elevated ferritin, and low absolute lymphocyte levels. Furthermore,
previous studies have reported that COVID-19 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable
state and patients with severe COVID-19 have an increased risk of venous
thromboembolism and stroke.4,35 In this series, D-dimer levels were found to be
elevated and one patient had a cerebrovascular event leading to significant neurological
sequelae. The biological underpinnings of these observations remain to be further
explained in functional studies.

No treatment has so far shown an unequivocal beneficial effect for treatment of COVID19. Hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin was initially suggested to be
an effective treatment combination; however, validation trials have been unable to
confirm beneficial effects. Importantly, the World Health Organization recently
expressed concern over cardiac arrhythmias and other potentially serious effects with
the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination and several of the initial publications
have now been retracted.36-39 A few patients in our series were treated with lopinavirritonavir; however, clinical trials have not shown a clinical benefit of these anti-retroviral

drugs.40 Recent reports on remdesivir as well as treatment with convalescent plasma
therapy have showed promising results and there are case reports on successful
treatment of COVID-19 with IL-6 blockade.41-46 Additionally, there are indications that
the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor acalabrutinib can reduce the excessive inflammatory
response in patients with severe COVID-19.47

Limitations of this study includes it being a case-series from tertiary cancer centers with
a selected patient population in which patients who were treated at local hospitals in the
outpatient setting were less likely to be included. There was missing data for certain
laboratory results for some of the patients, primarily those who were treated as
outpatients where not all tested for C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, or IL-6 levels.

In summary, we present data on a large case-series of COVID-19 positive patients with
multiple myeloma and related precursor diseases showing case fatality rates in the
higher range of reports from the general population. We comprehensively investigated
the role of other comorbidities and found that the strongest risk factors for severe
outcome were similar to those in the general population. The molecular and
immunological mechanisms responsible for this finding remain unclear; however, given
that patients with multiple myeloma are at an increased risk of various other infections
due to both disease and treatment associated immunosuppression 17, current
recommendation by American Society of Hematology and the International Myeloma
Society state that high-dose melphalan chemotherapy followed with autologous stem
cell transplant should be postponed, if possible, until the pandemic levels off.25,26

Ongoing larger studies with a wide range of hematological malignancies will provide
additional information on geographical variations of risk factors in these patients. Going
forward, until there is a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, clinical
management and treatment of patients with multiple myeloma have to be carefully
considered and adjusted to reduce the risk of exposure and minimize immunesuppression, while still aiming to achieve deep remissions in the era of COVID-19.
