Abstract

24

Children are less susceptible to COVID-19 and manifests lower morbidity and mortality after

25

infection, for which a multitude of mechanisms may be proposed. Whether the normal development

26

of gut-airway microbiome is affected by COVID-19 has not been evaluated. We demonstrate that

27

COVID-19 alters the respiratory and gut microbiome of children. Alteration of the microbiome was

28

divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, albeit the dysbiosis was dominated by genus

29

Pseudomonas and sustained for up to 25-58 days in different individuals. The respiratory microbiome

30

distortion persisted in 7/8 children for at least 19-24 days after discharge from the hospital. The gut

31

microbiota showed early dysbiosis towards later restoration in some children, but not others.

32

Disturbed development of both gut and respiratory microbiomes, and prolonged respiratory dysbiosis

33

in children imply possible long-term complications after clinical recovery from COVID-19, such as

34

predisposition to an increased health risk in the post-COVID-19 era.

Introduction

38

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has impacted millions of peoples in more than 200 countries

39

around the world1,2. Compared with adults, children appear to be less susceptible to COVID-19 with

40

extremely low morbidity and mortality3-5; and children with COVID-19 often have mild symptoms

41

with a faster recovery, and better prognosis. The reasons for these are not entirely clear. Early-life

42

development and maturation of human microbiomes shape health status in later life6-9, and delayed

43

development or dysbiosis of the microbiomes during childhood has been linked to predisposition to

44

various diseases in adulthood7-12. The effect of COVID-19 on the gut microbiome had just began to

45

be evaluated in adults13,14, but never in children. We recently evaluated the longitudinal effects of

46

COVID-19 on both the respiratory and gut microbiome in adults, and revealed that the respiratory

47

and gut microbiome presented a contemporaneous change from early dysbiosis towards late

48

incomplete restoration during the course of disease (Xu et al., unpublished observation). How

49

COVID-19 impacts on the respiratory and gut microbiomes of children is not known. Here, we report

50

temporal dynamics of respiratory and gut microbiome in children with COVID-19.

Results

52

Study cohort

53

Nine COVID-19 children between 7-139 months old were enrolled in this study together with

54

14 age-matched healthy control children. A total of 103 specimens including 27 sets of paired

55

specimens (at least two of throat swab, nasal swab and feces) were collected from children with

56

COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The children were being followed between 25-58 days after

57

symptom onset. All samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing of the V4-region of

58

bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Methods).

60

Respiratory and gut microbiome dynamics in COVID-19

61

We analyzed the 16S-rRNA gene sequences of all specimens from three body sites, and obtained

62

2,187 sub-OTUs (sOTUs) that represent 15 known phyla including 200 known genera

63

(Supplementary Table 1). Using the DMM method (Supplementary method), we identified 8

64

community types (Fig.1a). The specimens from healthy children clustered into two community types,

65

one bears the signature of stool samples (H-GUT), and another represents the collection of all three

66

kinds of samples (throat swab, nasal swab and feces) (H-MIX). H-GUT is significantly separated

67

from H-MIX (Fig. 1b), with significantly lower richness and evenness (Fig.1c). H-GUT was featured

68

by Moraxella, a commensal in nasal passages of infants, implying that it might not represent a normal

69

gut microbiome status. Because the development of infant microbiome is influenced by maternal

70

materials from multiple sites (stool, vaginal, oral and skin) among which bacteria from maternal gut

71

being the most important contributor15, infants and children may share the same or very similar

72

microbial community structures of the nasal cavity, throat and gut16,17. Therefore, H-MIX represents

73

the gut and respiratory tract microbiomes of healthy children. In fact, the nasal cavity, throat and gut

74

still maintain similar microbial structures in adulthood.

75

Bacteria from stool specimens of COVID-19 children fell into three distinct community types

76

(COVID-GUT I-III), and those from nasal and throat swabs formed another three distinct types

77

(COVID-TN I-III) (Fig. 1a). All COVID-19-related types are significantly separated from the type

78

H-MIX except COVID-TN-I that overlaps with H-MIX (Fig. 1b). In particular, three respiratory tract-

79

related types and three GUT-related types of COVID-19 children are also significantly separated from

80

each other, and distinctly different from healthy children. These results indicated that SARS-CoV-2

81

infection significantly changed the gut and respiratory tract microbiota of children, and the separation

82

of bacterial community structures between the gut and respiratory tracts suggested that the normal

83

development of the microbiota may be impaired.

84

All COVID-19-related types showed lower richness and evenness than H-MIX, except for

85

COVID-GUT-I that has the most similarity to H-MIX and relatively normal microbiome structure.

86

There was a gradual decrease from community type I to III for both gut and respiratory tract (Fig. 1c),

87

indicating a progressive deterioration (dysbiosis) of the microbiome. Overall, the dysbiosis appeared

88

to be more severe in the respiratory tract than in the gut.

89
90

Indicator genera of eight DMM clusters

91

To characterize eight microbial community types, we identified 35 indicator genera (Fig. 2a).

92

The H-MIX type was characterized by 11 genera, and the predominant commensal bacteria contained

93

Prevotella, Streptococcus, unclassified Pasteurellaceae, and Actinomyces (Fig. 2b). Some of the

94

indicator bacteria in H-MIX were shared by the community types COVID-GUT-I (e.g. Prevotella,

95

Porphyromonas, Finegoldia, Anaerococcus, etc.) and COVID-TN-I (e.g. Prevotella, Neisseria,

96

Fusobacterium, unclassified Pasteurellaceae, Leptotrichia etc.). As a dysbiosis status, community

97

type COVID-GUT-III was dominated by Bacteroides, as well as Parasutterella that is associated with

98

irritable bowel syndrome and other intestinal chronic inflammation18. Community type COVID-TN-

99

III was dominated by highly abundant Pseudomonas and Herbaspirillum, and it had higher levels of

100

genera of Corynebacterium, Comamonadaceae, Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Brevundimonas,

101

Ralstonia, Phyllobacterium, and Burkholderiales than other community types (Fig. 2b). Genus

102

Pseudomonas is a notorious human pathogen associated with various diseases (e.g. pneumonia), and

103

the samples were overwhelmed by the dominant species Pseudomonas veronii (100% sequence

104

identity)19. Apart from COVID-TN-III, genus Pseudomonas also dominated community type

105

COVID-TN-II with Streptococcus, and COVID-GUT-II with Bacteroides. Furthermore,

106

Achromobacter and Burkholderia are associated with cystic fibrosis20,21, and most other genera are

107

environmental bacteria. The predominance of Pseudomonas together with the colonization of various

108

environmental bacteria in type COVID-TN-III imply an extreme dysbiosis in upper respiratory tract.

109
110

The dynamic change of children during COVID-19

111

Recently, we observed synchronous restoration of the microbiomes of both respiratory tract and

112

the gut towards normal structure in COVID-19 adults within a short time (6-17 days) after symptom

113

onset (Xu et al., unpublished observation). Distinct from adults, the microbiome community

114

compositions were extremely dynamic in children during COVID-19, and the changes of the

115

community types in the respiratory tract and gut were divergent (Fig. 3a). The respiratory (especially

116

nasopharyngeal) microbiome of 7/8 children (except CV05) appeared to evolve from early healthy

117

(H-MIX) or high-diversity community structures (COVID-TN-I) to late low-diversity dysbiosis

118

structure (COVID-TN-III), indicating a steady deterioration in composition and function of the

119

respiratory microbiome despite a fast clinical recovery (Fig. 3a). Surprisingly, the respiratory

120

dysbiosis was sustained at least 19-24 days after discharge (i.e., 42-58 days after symptom onset) in

121

three children (CV01, CV02 and CV09).

122

In contrast, the gut microbiome alternation varied greatly among these COVID-19 children.

123

Improvement or restoration was observed in three children (CV01, CV02 and CV05), but a worsening

124

trend of unstable bacterial genera occurred in another three children (CV03, CV04 and CV09) (Fig.

125

3a). For example, the community type of CV09 improved from COVID-GUT-II to COVID-GUT-I

126

on day 7 after symptom onset, but deteriorated to COVID-GUT-III on day 37. For CV03, whose

127

microbiome got worse from a gut community type COVID-GUT-II on day 19 to a respiratory

128

community type COVID-TN-III on day 27, and returned to COVID-GUT-II on day 43. The shift from

129

a slightly dysbiosis gut community type to a severely dysbiosis respiratory community type implies

130

microbial translocations from respiratory tract to gut. The restoration or worsening of the gut

131

microbiome showed no association with clinical recovery (discharge from the hospital) or the

132

presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gut (Fig.3a).

133

Our data clearly demonstrate a progressively worsening of microbiome in both the respiratory

134

tract and gut of children during the course of COVID-19. The worsening was predominantly driven

135

by Pseudomonas species P.veronii (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2), which was the most prevalent

136

Pseudomonas species identified, and had a relative abundance of over 20% in most COVID-19

137

children. Genus Streptococcus (mainly S.mitis) also contributed to the worsening of the microbiome22.

138

On the other hand, the presence of probiotic Bifidobacterium and the most important butyrate7

139

producing bacteria Faecalibacterium were inversely correlated with the existence of Pseudomonas

140

(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2), despite these beneficial bacteria presented at a very low relative

141

abundance and often decreased in late disease stage.

142
143

Bacteria–bacteria co-occurrence networks

144

The co-occurrence network analysis revealed significant microbial cross-talk among different

145

body sites of children with COVID-19 (Fig. 4). There were three main co-occurrence networks

146

identified. Positive co-occurrence relationships were observed within and between bacteria from the

147

respiratory tract and the gut (FDR-adjusted P<0.001, Pearson correlation r > 0.4), indicating the

148

presence of frequent bacterial cross-talk between different body sites. Similar to our observation in

149

adults, the co-occurrence networks were relatively separated by different diversity-levels of

150

community types, but not by body sites. For example, bacteria from the community type COVID-

151

TN-III are closely associated with those from COVID-TN-II and COVID-GUT-II (Fig. 4). In this

152

network, Pseudomonas was positively correlated with some environmental bacteria. In another two

153

networks, probiotic (e.g. Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium) were mainly correlated with

154

commensals and community types H-MIX, COVID-GUT-I, COVID-TN-I and COVID-TN-II (Fig.

155

4). Therefore, the community types are more representative of microbiome status.

Discussion

157

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes damage to multiple organs either through direct infection, or

158

indirectly disrupt host homeostasis, including perturbation of gut and respiratory microbiota in adults.

159

Here, we report the first longitudinal investigation of microbiome with sampling from multiple

160

anatomical sites of children with COVID-19, and present evidence that children have distinct

161

differences compared to adults (Xu, unpublished observations), with respect to the dynamic changes

162

of microbiota during the course of disease. The study of children is a significant feature because early-

163

life microbiome plays important roles in the development of host immunity, metabolism, and neural

164

systems, affecting profoundly health status in later life7. The microbiome attains a relatively stable

165

adult-like structure at the age 3 after a highly dynamic initial developmental (months 3-14) phase, a

166

transitional (months 15-30) phase, and finally a stable phase (months 31-46)16. The development of

167

infants’ microbiomes is more easily influenced by various internal (genetic) and external factors (e.g.

168

birth mode, feeding type, siblings, antibiotics, and infection)7,9, and maternal gut strains provide the

169

largest contribution to the microbiome composition15. Early-life microbiome disruption caused by

170

antibiotics and malnutrition is associated with increased risk of health problems later in childhood

171

and even adulthood, such as developmental retardation, allergic diseases, obesity, diabetes and

172

immune dysfunction3-5,23,24.

173

SARS-CoV-2 infection impaired the respiratory and gut microbiota in both adults and children,

174

but the respiratory and gut microbiome of children and adults faced diverging fates (Supplementary

175

Fig. 3). In some mild adult cases, the respiratory and gut microbiomes showed a synchronous

176

restoration from early dysbiosis towards later near-normal structure within a short period (6-17 days),

177

substantially earlier than their clinical recovery (Xu et al. unpublished observation). In children,

178

however, the dynamic changes of the microbiome were divergent between respiratory tract and gut,

179

and the microbiome appeared to be progressively worsening, especially in the respiratory tract for a

180

long period (25-52 days), substantially later than their clinical recovery (12-37 days) (Supplementary

181

Fig. 3). In this cohort, six children were older than 3 years of age, and should have relatively stable

182

adult-like microbiome. The dynamic characteristics of the microbiome during COVID-19 implied

183

that children’s microbiome is still particularly vulnerable and less resilient than that of the adults even

184

after attaining a stable phase7,9,16. Importantly, the persistent worsening of the microbiomes caused

185

by COVID-19 might impart potential short-term and long-term health problems during childhood and

186

adulthood.

187

We and other have reported that altered respiratory microbiome with reduced bacterial diversity

188

increased the susceptibility of children to acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs)6,8,25-27. The

189

impaired microbiome in children with COVID-19 is characterized by Pseudomonas-dominated

190

community types that favor the colonization and growth of pathogenic and environmental bacteria,

191

and a reduction of some beneficial commensals (Fig. 4). Probiotic (e.g. Bifidobacterium) and

192

butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. Faecalibacterium) that have anti-inflammatory ability were

193

extensively depleted from the gut and respiratory microbiomes of the children especially at late stage

194

of COVID-19 (Fig. 3b)28,29. Low abundance or lack of butyrate-producing bacteria might tolerate

195

low-level inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2, rendering children more vulnerable to ARTIs and

196

diarrheal diseases8,9,30. In particular, the enrichment of genera Moraxella and Streptococcus in these

197

COVID-19 children might predispose them to an increased risk of recurrent ARTIs6.

198

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the complex dynamics of the gut and

199

respiratory microbiota in children with COVID-19. Disturbed development of both gut and

200

respiratory microbiomes, and prolonged respiratory dysbiosis caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection

201

imply possible short-term and long-term complications after they have recovered from COVID-19,

202

and predispose afflicted children to an increased health risk in later life. Although the long-term

203

outcomes of COVID-19 on children need to be further studied with more extended follow-up and

204

larger cohort, our data suggest that early implementation of various intervention strategies to

205

modulate the microbiome development may provide clinical benefit to children in the post COVID-

206

19 era.

Method

313

Study population

314

Nine children were diagnosed as COVID-19 patients by Children's Hospital of Fudan University

315

according to the National Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19. A total of 103

316

samples, including 31 nasal swabs, 28 throat swabs and 44 feces, were collected from these patients

317

(Supplementary Fig. S1). Twenty-five samples from 14 age-matched healthy children were used as

318

controls. The respiratory samples were collected using flexible, sterile, dry swabs, which can reach

319

the posterior nasopharynx and oropharynx easily (approximately 2 inches). About 2 ml spontaneous,

320

unstimulated fecal specimen (300 mg/tube) was collected into a sterile cryogenic vial (Corning, NY,

321

USA), divided into aliquots and stored at –80 °C until use. The sampling was performed by the

322

professionals at the hospital.

323

The study was approved by Children’s Hospital of Fudan University (2020-27). Informed consents

324

were obtained from involved patients or their guardians.

325
326

Confirmation of COVID-19 children

327

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding patterns of these

328

patients were previously reported31,32. All nine COVID-19 children had mild symptoms. The virus

329

RNA was extracted from all samples using a Mag-Bind RNA Extraction Kit (MACCURA, Sichuan,

330

China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ORFlab and N genes of SARS-CoV-2 was

331

detected using a Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA detection Kit (PCR-Fluorescence Probing)

332

(DAAN gene, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

16S rRNA gene sequencing

335

All samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs and stool samples were subjected to the DNA

336

extraction using a QIAamp DNA Microbiome Kit (QIAGEN, Düsseldorf, Germany). A novel triple-

337

index amplicon sequencing strategy was used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing33. In brief, a set of

338

universal bacterial primers was used to amplify the V4 hypervariable region (515-806 nt) of the 16S

339

rRNA gene. Two rounds of PCR amplifications were performed 34. A reaction mixture containing 8

340

μL Nuclease-free water, 0.5 μL KOD-Plus-Neo (TOYOBO, Osaka Boseki, Japan), 2.5 μL of 1 μM

341

PCR1 forward primer, 2.5 μL of 1 μM PCR1 reverse primer, and 5 μL DNA template was prepared

342

for the first round of the PCR (PCR1) amplification. PCR1 products were purified using Monarch

343

DNA Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and quantified by a Qubit®

344

4.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Purified PCR1 products were pooled with equal

345

amounts, and then subjected to the secondary round of PCR (PCR2) amplification. The PCR2 mix

346

contains 21 μL Nuclease-free water, 1 μL KOD-Plus-Neo (TOYOBO, Osaka Boseki, Japan), 5 μL of

347

1 μM PCR2 forward primer, 5 μL of 1 μM PCR2 reverse primer, and 5 μL pooled PCR1 products.

348

The PCR2 products were purified using the same Gel Extraction Kit and qualified using the Qubit®

349

4.0 Fluorometer. The specific products were further qualified using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer

350

(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The PCR2 products with equal moles of specific products were

351

pooled and mixed them with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA) in a ratio of

352

0.8:1. After purification, the amplicons were paired-end sequenced (2x250) using Illumina-P250

353

sequencer.

356

Using USEARCH11 software35 and FASTX-Toolkit36, sequenced reads were merged, de-multiplexed

357

and filtered. After trimming barcode, adapter and primer sequences using USEARCH11, 14,702, 896

358

sequences were retained with an average of 100019 sequences per sample. Based on the Qiime2

359

platform37, the Deblur38 was used to cluster sequence data into sub-OTUs (operational taxonomic

360

units), better than traditional OTU picking usually according to 97% sequence similarity threshold

361

which may miss subtle and real biological sequence variation39. In particular, we used the Deblur to

362

perform quality control, dereplicate, chimeras remove on with default settings except for truncating

363

sequence length to 250bp. A sub-OTU (sOTU) count table, equivalent to OTU table, was generated

364

(2187 sOTUs). The taxonomic classification of sOTU representative sequences was assigned by using

365

the RDP Naive Bayesian Classifier algorithm40 based on the Ribosomal Database project (RDP) 16S

366

rRNA training set (v16) database41. Finally, the sOTU table were subsampled at an even depth of

367

3600 sequences per sample to eliminate the bias led by different sequencing depths among samples.

368

The sOTU coverage of 87% was sufficient to capture microbial diversity.

Identification and characteristics of microbial community types

371

Based on the bacterial genus abundance, we used the Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM)42

372

algorithm introduced by mothur43 v1.44.1 to identify microbial community types because the DMM

373

algorithm could efficiently cluster samples based on microbial composition, whose sensitivity,

374

reliability and accuracy were widely confirmed in many microbiome studies16,44,45. Based on the

375

lowest Laplace approximation index, the appropriate microbial community type numbers (DMM

376

clusters) were determined. Conjugated with the Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM), the reliability of

377

DMM clustering was further validated and then visualized by the Non-metric multidimensional

379

statistic “R” compares the mean of ranked dissimilarities between groups to the mean of ranked

380

dissimilarities within groups. An R value close to “1.0” suggests dissimilarity between groups while

381

an R value close to “0” suggests an even distribution of high and low ranks within and between

382

groups46. ANOSIM p values lower than 0.05 suggest the higher similarity within sites. Richness

estimating the difference of alpha diversity. Those analyses described above were performed using R

385

package “vegan” v2.5-6. Using R package ‘Pheatmap’, the dynamic change of microbial community

386

types and compositions were visualized. Alpha diversity difference between groups were measured

387

using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test in R.

389

Identification of indicator taxa contributing to microbial community typing

390

To get the reliable indicator genus for community typing, we performed the Indicator Species

391

Analysis using the indicspecies package (ver.1.7.8) 47 in R platform with top 40 genus contributing

392

to DMM clustering that accounted for 71% cumulative difference. Dynamic changes of indicator

the progress of COVID-19 in adults and children. The dynamic mechanism of the microbiome in

472

from 35 adults with COVID-19 (Xu et al. unpublished data). Similar community types from I to III/IV

473

indicate a progressive dysbiosis of the microbiome. In mild adults with COVID-19, a synchronous

474

shift of community type from early dysbiosis towards late incomplete restoration was found in both

475

respiratory and gut microbiomes within a short time. In children, however, the changes of the

476

community types were divergent between the respiratory tract and gut, possibly implying that the

477

“airway-gut axis” is still not established during the childhood. Moreover, children’s respiratory

478

microbiome appeared to be progressively worsening for a long period despite a fast clinical recovery.
