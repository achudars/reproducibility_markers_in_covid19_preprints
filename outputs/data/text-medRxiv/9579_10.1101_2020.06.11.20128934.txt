Abstract
The need for reliable and widely available SARS-CoV-2 testing is well recognized, but it
will be equally necessary to develop quantitative methods that determine viral load in order to
guide patient triage and medical decision making. We are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral
load at the time of presentation is an independent predictor of COVID-19 mortality in a large
patient cohort (n=1,145). Viral loads should be used to identify higher-risk patients that may
require more aggressive care and should be included as a key biomarker in the development of
predictive algorithms.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 detection platforms currently report qualitative results. However, RT-PCRbased technology allows for quantification of viral loads, which have been associated with
transmission risk and disease severity in other viral illnesses1. Similarly, viral load in COVID-19
may correlate with infectivity, disease phenotype, morbidity and mortality. To date, few studies
have reported on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and no studies have assessed viral load and mortality
in large patient cohorts.2,3,4,5 This letter is the first to report SARS-CoV-2 viral load at the time of
diagnosis as an independent predictor of COVID-19 mortality in a large hospitalized cohort
(n=1,145) within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.

Methods
We prospectively evaluated nasopharyngeal swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 by the Roche
cobas® 6800. Positive samples were also evaluated by a laboratory-developed quantitative RTPCR test6. A six-fold standard dilution curve was run in triplicate (limit of detection 1x103 viral
RNA genome equivalents/mL). Viral loads (N2) were log transformed and a constant was added.

Results
Viral loads for 1,145 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were measured on
samples collected between 3/13/2020 and 5/4/2020 that tested positive on both the Roche cobas®
6800 and the laboratory-developed test at the time of diagnosis. The cohort had an average age of
64.6 years, was 56.9% male, and had a self-reported race breakdown of African-American

(31.2%), White (29.3%), Asian (3.7%), Other (32.8%) and Unknown (3.1%). The overall mean
log10 viral load for the group was 5.56 viral copies/mL, and the median log10 viral load was 6.16
viral copies/mL. By the end of the study period, 807 were alive (70.5%; mean log10 viral load 5.19
+/- 2.99 viral copies/mL) and 338 had died (29.5%; mean log10 viral load was 6.44 +/- 2.66 viral
copies/mL).
A Cox proportional hazards model was performed to evaluate the association between viral
load and mortality, adjusting for multiple baseline clinical and demographic characteristics
including age, sex, race, asthma, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, hypertension, and stroke that yielded a
statistically significant independent association between viral load and mortality (HR 1.069, CI
1.026-1.11; p=0.0014) (Figure 1A). Furthermore, a univariate survival analysis revealed a
statistically significant survival probability between those with a high (defined as greater than the
log10 viral load mean of 5.557) and low viral load (p = 0.0003; Figure 1B), with a mean follow up
time of 12.8 days, and a maximum follow up of 66 days.

Discussion
Deployment and scaling of testing have been critical in the management of COVID-19, yet
the challenge of understanding who is at risk for worse outcomes early in their illness remains.
Here, we demonstrate a relationship between high viral load and increased mortality in a large
hospitalized cohort. High viral load could signify greater disease severity or a more compromised
host, with both scenarios requiring closer clinical monitoring and a high index of suspicion for
poor outcome and death.

Transforming front-line qualitative testing into a quantitative viral load will assist
clinicians in risk-stratifying patients who should be admitted and closely monitored versus those
who may safely convalesce at home. Viral loads may also affect isolation measures based on
infectivity. It will also be of great interest to address SARS-CoV-2 viral load dynamics in
individual patients and the quantitative relationship with neutralizing antibodies, cytokines and
other covariates.
