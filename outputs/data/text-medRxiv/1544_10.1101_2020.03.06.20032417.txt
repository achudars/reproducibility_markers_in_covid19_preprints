Summary
Background:
The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and
become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the
distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of
COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we
propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution.

Methods:
We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic
individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms
developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and
the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions,
the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the
distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing
recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data.

Findings:
The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated
median of incubation period is 8·13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7·37-8·91), the mean is 8·62 days
(95% CI: 8·02-9·28), the 90th percentile is 14·65 days (95% CI: 14·00-15·26), and the 99th percentile is
20·59 days (95% CI: 19·47, 21·62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period
estimated in this study is longer.

Interpretation:
Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would
not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is
warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.

Funding:
This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China grant 8204100362 and
Zhejiang University special scientific research fund for COVID-19 prevention and control.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China, there were two other
coronaviruses that have caused major global epidemics over the last two decades. Severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) spread to 37 countries and caused 8424 cases and 919 deaths in 2002-03, while Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread to 27 countries, causing 2494 cases and 858 deaths worldwide
to date. Precise knowledge of the incubation period is crucial for the prevention and control of these
diseases. We have searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published as of February 22, 2020,
which contain information about these diseases by using the key words of “COVID-19”, “SARS”,
“MERS”, “2019-nCoV”, “coronavirus”, and “incubation”. We have found 15 studies that estimated the
distribution of the incubation period. There are four articles focused on COVID-19, five on MERS, and
six on SARS. Most of these studies had limited sample sizes and were potentially influenced by recall
bias. The estimates for mean, median, and percentiles of the incubation period from these articles are
summarized in Table 1.

Added value of this study
In the absence of complete and robust contact-tracing data, we have inferred the distribution of the
incubation period of COVID-19 from the durations between departure from Wuhan and symptom onset
for the confirmed cases. More than 1000 cases were collected from publicly available data. The proposed
approach has a solid theoretical foundation and enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall
bias and utilizing a large pool of samples.

Implications of all the available evidence
Based on our model, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 do not develop symptoms until 14 days after
infection. Further study of individuals with long incubation periods is warranted.

Introduction
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of China and World Health Organization (WHO)
are closely monitoring the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was first
identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and has quickly spread across countries and become a global
crisis. As of February 22, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of China had confirmed a total
of 76 936 cases of COVID-19 in mainland China, including 2442 fatalities and 22 888 recoveries.1
Various containment measures, including travel restrictions, isolation, and quarantine have been
implemented in China with the aim to minimize virus transmission via human-to-human contact.2

Quarantine of individuals with exposure to infectious pathogens has always been an effective approach
for containing contagious diseases in the past. One of the critical factors to determine the optimal
quarantine of asymptomatic individuals is a good understanding of the incubation period, and this has
been lacking for COVID-19.

The incubation period of an infectious disease is the time elapsed between infection and appearance of the
first symptoms and signs. Precise knowledge of the incubation period would help to provide an optimal
length of quarantine period for disease control purpose, and also is essential in the investigation of the
mechanism of transmission and development of treatment. For example, the distribution of the incubation
period is used to estimate the reproductive number , that is, the average number of secondary infections
produced by a primary case. The reproductive number is a key quantity that impacts the potential size of
an epidemic. Despite the importance of the incubation period, it is often poorly estimated based on limited
data.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only a handful of studies estimating the incubation period of
COVID-19. Among them are Li et al (2020), Guan et al (2020), Backer et al (2020), and Linton et al
(2020).3–6 In Li et al, the first 425 lab-confirmed cases, reported as of January 22, 2020, were included in
the study, while only ten cases could be identified with the exact dates of exposure.3 The distribution of
the incubation period was subsequently approximated by fitting a lognormal distribution to these ten data
points, resulting in a mean incubation period of 5·2 days (95% CI: 4·1-7·0), and the 95th percentile is 12·5
days. However, given the limited sample size, it is challenging to make a solid inference on the
distribution of the incubation period. A different result was reported by Guan et al, based on 291 patients
who had clear information regarding the specific date of exposure as of January 29, 2020, stating that the
median incubation period was 4·0 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7).4 However, such study of the
incubation period can be highly influenced by the individuals’ recall bias or interviewers’ judgement on
the possible dates of exposure rather than the actual dates of exposure that, in turn, might not be
accurately monitored and determined, thus leading to a high percentage of error. In Backer et al, 88
confirmed cases detected outside Wuhan were used to estimate the distribution of the incubation period.5
For each selected case, a censored interval for the incubation period can be obtained by travel history and
symptoms onset. The distribution of the incubation period can then be estimated by fitting a Weibull,
gamma, or lognormal distribution with censored data. However, this method contained two types of
sampling biases: (1) with the longer incubation period, the patients who resided at Wuhan but developed
symptoms outside Wuhan were easier to be observed and hence lead to an overestimation; (2) if the
follow-up time (from infection to the end of the study) is short, only the shorter incubation period would

be observed and hence lead to an underestimation. Linton et al proposed a similar approach to estimate
the incubation period of Backer et al, but corrected the aforementioned second sampling bias.5,6 However,
the first problem in regard to sampling bias is still an unsolved issue. The estimates of the incubation
period from these four studies, together with other results of two other coronavirus disease, SARS and
MERS, are listed in Table 1.

To overcome the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel method to estimate the incubation period
of COVID-19 by using the well-known renewal theory in probability.18 Such a method enhances the
accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing abundance of the readily available forward
time with a large sample size of 1211. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is a study of the
distribution of the incubation period involving the largest number of samples to date. We find the
estimated median of the incubation period is 8·13 days (95% CI: 7·37-8·91), and mean is 8·62 days (95%
CI: 8·02-9·28), the 90th percentile is 14·65 days (95% CI: 14·00-15·26), and the 99th percentile is 20·59

days (95% CI: 19·47- 21·62). Our estimated incubation period of COVID-19 is longer than the those
given by previous researches on SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 in Table 1.

Methods
Motivations
As described in the previous section, the distribution of the incubation period in most of the literature is
either described through a parametric model or its empirical distribution based on the observed incubation
period from the contact-tracing data. However, the contact-tracing data are challenging and expensive to
obtain, and their accuracy can be highly influenced by recall bias. Hence, a low-cost and high-accuracy
method to estimate the incubation distribution is needed.

Based on the COVID-19 daily updates from provincial and municipal health commissions in China, we
notice that there is an abundance of cases who asymptomatically left Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19,
and developed symptoms outside Wuhan. Assuming that these cases were infected before their departure
from Wuhan, the time differences between departure and symptoms onset is the censored observations of
their incubation periods. Hence, we conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by assuming
to catch those asymptomatic individuals at their departure time and followed them until their symptoms
developed. Using the language of renewal processes, we can treat the development of the disease starting
from infection by a pathogen as a stochastic process that could be observed from a specific time point in
chronological order. In this study, the specific time point refers to the time of departure from Wuhan. For
each prevalent case, the complete process from the infection to the onset of symptoms can be considered
as a renewal process. As illustrated in Figure 1, the backward recurrence time is hence defined as the time
between infection and departure from Wuhan, and the forward recurrence time is the time between
departure from Wuhan and symptom onset. Clearly, the forward time is observable and the corresponding
observations are with good veracity, while the backward time is either unable to be observed or the
corresponding observations are with large uncertainty due to recall bias. Note that for each infected
individual, the backward time and forward time do not have to be same. However, when the renewal
process reaches its equilibrium status, it becomes reversible, that is, the statistical properties of this
process is the same as the one for time-reversed data in a same process. Hence, at equilibrium, the
backward time can be treated as the forward time if time periods are reversed.19

In order to model incubation using the renewal process properly, the following assumptions are
established:
(A1). The renewal process has reached its equilibrium status;

Page 6 of 16

(A2). The distribution of the incubation period is continuous;
(A3). The distribution of the incubation period has a finite first moment;
(A4). The incubation period for each case is independent and identically distributed;
(A5). The cases included in the analysis were infected at Wuhan and developed their symptoms outside
Wuhan.

In this study, it is reasonable to assume (A1) is satisfied between January 19, 2020, and January 23, 2020,
because there are over eleven million residents in the Wuhan metropolitan area and nearby neighborhoods
and the daily travel volume in and out of Wuhan exceeded million before January 23, 2020. We justify
the use of data between January 19 and January 23 below. With adequate long run, the renewal process
would reach the equilibrium status. The assumptions (A2) to (A4) are standard. In fact, we may assume
that the incubation period is a continuous variable with range 0,   for some finite number  . It is well
known that the first moment exists for a bounded random variable. The justification for assumption (A5)
is below. Therefore, the probability renewal process theory can be applied with confidence, and thus we
can avoid the challenging mission of ascertaining the backward time.

Data collection and justification
Publicly available data were retrieved from provincial and municipal health commissions in China and the
ministries of health in other countries, including 12 963 confirmed cases outside Hubei province as of
February 15, 2020. Detailed information on confirmed cases includes region, gender, age, date of
symptom onset, date of confirmation, history of travel or residency in Wuhan, and date of departure from
Wuhan. The date of symptoms onset in these data refers to the date reported by the patient on which the
clinical symptoms first appeared, where the clinical symptoms include fever, cough, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and others. Among 12 963 confirmed cases, 6345 cases had their dates of symptom onset
collected; 3169 cases had histories of travel or residency in Wuhan; 2514 cases had their dates of
departure recorded; and 1922 cases had records of both dates of departure from Wuhan and dates of
symptoms onset.

However, not all 1922 cases should be taken in the analysis. We have to ensure that (1) assumption (A5)
is satisfied, and (2) the follow-up time is long enough. To make sure that the assumption (A5) is being
satisfied as much as possible, we (1) exclude cases whose first symptoms appeared before departure, and
(2) exclude cases who left Wuhan before January 19, 2020. This date was used because before January 19,
the Chinese public was not aware of the severity of this epidemic, and those who left Wuhan might still
have had close contact with other infected cases from Wuhan and hence actually got infected outside

Wuhan. However, starting January 19, the China CDC began issuing test reagents to all provinces,
confirmed cases were reported outside Hubei province in mainland China, the severity of COVID-19 was
widely noted by the public, and various strict containment measures were implemented to minimize
human-to-human transmission.2 Thus, it is unlikely that confirmed cases who left Wuhan after January 19,
2020, were infected outside Wuhan and assumption (A5) is supported. To ensure that the follow-up time
is long enough such that no additional biased sampling occurred in this study, we excluded all cases who
left Wuhan after January 23, 2020, which leaves an average follow-up time of 25 days (from date of
departure to February 15, which is the end of this study). A 25-day follow-up period should be long
enough based on the various studies on the incubation period of COVID-19.3-6 Note that those who left
Wuhan after January 23 might not have enough time to develop symptoms before the end of the followup period. Including these cases in the cohort might lead to a downward bias on the incubation period.
Note that the latest date of symptom onset in our cohort is February 12, 2020, which is ten days before the
end of the follow-up period. This period should be long enough for a case to develop symptoms.
Furthermore, there were only 49 cases who left Wuhan after the lockdown of Wuhan city on January 23,
2020.20 After examining the collected data, there were a total of 1211 cases that meet the criteria and were
followed forwardly.

Among the 1209 cases with gender information in the study, 533 (44·09%) are female. The mean age of

Sensitivity analysis
It is arguable that people who left Wuhan might also be infected at the day of departure since they had a
higher chance to be exposed to this highly contagious, human-to-human–transmitted virus in a crowded
environment as cases were increasing. In such case, the duration between departure from Wuhan and
onset of symptoms is no longer only the forward time, but a mixture of the incubation period and the
forward time. Unfortunately, it is unclear who got infected before departure and who got infected at the
event of departure. Hence, a mixture sensitivity forward time model is proposed, that is,

Results
By fitting the observed forward times ௜ of the 1211 cases in our cohort to the likelihood function (4), we
find the maximum likelihood estimates +  2.04 (95% CI: 1·80-2·32) and ,  0.103 (95% CI: 0·096-

0·111) in our reference scenario. The estimated 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th, and 99·9th
percentiles of the incubation period are 2·27 (95% CI: 1·73-2·86), 5·28 (95% CI: 4·53-6·06), 8·13 (95% CI:
7·37-8·91), 11·42 (95% CI: 10·74-12·11), 14·65 (95% CI: 14·00-15·26), 16·67 (95% CI: 15·94-17·32),
20·59 (95% CI: 19·47-21·62), and 25·12 (95% CI: 23·35-26·87) days, respectively. The mean incubation
period is 8·62 (95% CI: 8·02-9·28) days. The average time from leaving Wuhan to symptom onset is 5·44
days, the sample median is 5 days, and the maximum is 21 days. Figure 2 visualizes the fitted density
function (3) in a solid line onto the histogram of observed forward times, and the dashed line is the
Weibull probability density function (2) for incubation period distribution. Note that (3) is a
monotonically decreasing function, which fits the observed forward times well, suggesting that our model
is reasonable and the results are therefore trustworthy.

Table 3 summaries the estimates of parameters, and the mean and percentiles of incubation period. We
can see that the estimates for mean and percentiles decrease as the proportion of people who got infected
at the event of departure, π, increases. However, the results are not shifted significantly. Variation of the
results from π  0 to 0.2 is only about one day.
Discussion
A sound estimate of the distribution of the incubation period plays a vital role in epidemiology. Its
application includes decisions regarding the length of quarantine for prevention and control, dynamic
models that accurately predict the disease process, and determining the contaminated source in foodborne
outbreaks. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the incubation distribution which only
requires information on travel histories and dates of symptoms onset. This method enhances the accuracy
of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing abundance of the readily available forward time data. In
addition, this is the first article to consider the incubation period for COVID-19 virus as a renewal process
which is a well-studied methodology and has a solid theoretical foundation. The estimated incubation
period has a median of 8·13 days (95% CI: 7·37-8·91), a mean of 8·62 days (95% CI: 8·02-9·28), the 90th
percentile is 14·65 days (95% CI: 14·00-15·26), and the 99th percentile is 20·59 days (95% CI: 19·4721·62). Compared with the results published in Li et al, Guan et al, Backer et al, and Linton et al, the
incubation period estimated in our study is significantly longer.3–6 Below is some evidence that may
potentially support our findings of the long incubation period:

1. In the study of Guan et al on behalf of China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19,
the incubation period had a reported median of 4 days, the first quartile of 2 days and the third
quartile of 7 days. 4 By fitting a commonly used Weibull distribution to such quartiles, we can
obtain + = 1.24 and ,  0.186 defined in Equation (2). As a consequence, the estimated 90%, 95%
and 99% percentiles are, respectively, 10·54, 13·04 and 18·45 days, which indicates that some
patients may have extended incubation periods.
2. One particular case reported by Yinbin municipal health commissions in China stated that a 64year-old female was diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 at Yinbin, Sichuan
province 20 days after returning from Wuhan. This patient was under self-quarantine at home
with the family for 18 days, from January 23 to February 9. On February 8, the patient developed
mild symptoms of cough with sputum production.21

Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would
not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection Our approach does require that certain assumptions
be met, which we detail below.

1. The collection of forward time depends on the follow-up time, that is, if the follow-up time is not
long enough, we would only be able to include those with a shorter incubation period in the
Wuhan departure cohort. This may lead to an underestimation of the incubation period. The same
limitation also applies to Backer et al and Linton et al.5,6 However, as explained earlier, we only
included cases who left Wuhan before January 23 in this study, which leaves an average followup time of 25 days. Hence it is less likely we missed those patients with longer incubation periods
based on the largest incubation period of 24 days reported in Guan et al.4 Note that the 24-day
incubation period was reported as an outlier in Guan et al.4
2. We assume that the individuals included in our cohort were either infected in Wuhan or on the
way to their destination from Wuhan, violation of such assumption lead to an overestimation of
incubation period. The same limitation also applies to Backer et al and Linton et al.5,6 However,
with a carefully selected cohort justified in the section of Method, the chance for an individual in
the Wuhan departure cohort getting infected outside Wuhan should be relatively small.
Nonetheless, we acknowledge this possibility exists, for example, a family member could be
uninfected by the time of departing Wuhan but got infected by other family members or outside
contacts after leaving Wuhan. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted by removing all cases
who left Wuhan with their families in the Wuhan departure cohort, and we found it only resulted
in a small change of the estimated distribution of the incubation period.
3. Individuals in our selected cohort were those who got infected in the early days of the outbreak.
They were likely the first- or second-generation cases. Our results do not apply to higher
generation cases if the virus mutates.
