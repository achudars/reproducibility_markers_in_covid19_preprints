Abstract
Background: Lockdown measures induce massive societal perturbations and can
differentially affect mental wellbeing in populations depending on individual
determinants. We aim at investigating the sociodemographic and environmental
determinants of wellbeing during global lockdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Methods: A nationwide survey was sent online to the French population during the
second week of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, between March
25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Volunteers were recruited on social networks, online
newspapers, and mailing lists. We analyzed sociodemographic and environmental
variables obtained from a co-built and evidence-based questionnaire. Mental
wellbeing was measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale
(WEMWBS). Results: We analyzed data from 11,391 (56.6%) out of 20,235
participants who answered the questionnaire. After weighting data on age and
gender distributions, 5415 of the respondents were male (47.5%), 5932 were female
(52.1%), and 52 (0.5%) registered as “other.” Multivariate analyses indicated that
various factors impacted mental wellbeing. Being female (p < .001), a student (p <
.001), disabled (p = .001), or having no access to outdoor space (p = 0.02) was
associated with lower WEMWBS scores. Conversely, being employed (p < .001) and
having more social contacts (p < .01) were both associated with greater mental
wellbeing. Interpretation: We revealed differences in mental wellbeing among the
French population at the early stages of global lockdown. Authorities should consider
the particular vulnerability of students, persons with disabilities, and those living in
constrained housing conditions that could increase the negative impact of lockdown
on mental health.

Introduction
Since the initial cases in China’s Hubei province, the coronavirus pandemic (SARSCoV-2) has progressed to Europe, which became the epicenter in March 20201. To
fight virus spread, most countries relied on “old-style” public health measures (e.g.
isolation, quarantine, social distancing, community containment)2. In line with other
countries and informed by models predicting a massive outbreak in the absence of
containment measures3, the French government enacted a lockdown of its entire
population for 15 days, beginning on March 16, 20204.
Massive social restrictions limit face-to-face interactions to the home and during the
purchase of necessities. For services deemed non-essential, telecommuting can be
enforced, or work can cease entirely. Individuals must reduce their movement to
restricted areas that vary depending on living conditions and environment. Thus,
lockdown has an immediate and massive impact on daily life. As quarantines and
large-scale lockdowns demonstrably impact mental health5, we hypothesized that
these effects are partially due to social and environmental characteristics.
Specifically, changes in routine (e.g., going to work versus unemployment), dissimilar
housing types, and variation in social support may generate stratification in mental
wellbeing. Early identification of risk factors could help healthcare authorities direct
more resources toward vulnerable subpopulations.
With this context, we started a nationwide online survey (LockUwell) during the
second week of the lockdown period.

We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey in France during March
25–30, 2020. Methodology and reporting of the results are based on the Checklist for
Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES)6.
Participants were recruited with online announcements on social networks, websites
of national newspapers, and mailing lists following a convenience non-sampling
method, with no incentives.
In line with French regulations on health research, no ethics committee approval was
required because data collection was anonymous.
A preliminary version of the “LockUwell” questionnaire was built after gathering
information on the lockdown and its psychological effects. The survey included
sociodemographic data (section 1), wellbeing from lockdown start (French version of
the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, WEMWBS7,8) (section 2), Visual
Numerical Scales for stress (section 3), antecedents (section 4), personal situation
regarding SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. whether respondents had or knew someone who had
SARS-CoV-2 and personal feelings regarding SARS-CoV-2) (section 5), as well as
personal and environmental conditions during lockdown (section 6). All sections were
presented separately and adapted to specific circumstances. The finalized version
was obtained through an iterative testing process that included revisions by
researchers, assistants, psychiatrists in several subspecialties, mental-health
services users, and citizens. The estimated duration of the questionnaire was 15 to
30 minutes.
Statistics were performed using SAS software 9.4 version (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA). The analysis included respondents aged ≥16 years living in France. We
weighted data using age and gender distributions from the 2020 French census. In

this first brief report, we analyzed data from sections 1, 2, and 6. We described
weighted-mean WEMWBS total scores and determinants. Independent variables in
the multivariate model were all determinants significantly associated with the total
score in bivariate analysis. Multicollinearity was screened using the Variance Inflation
Factor (VIF) and the COLLIN option on SAS and no collinearity was found.
Results:
Descriptive analysis
Of the 20,235 initial participants, 11,742 (58.3%) completed the questionnaire. After
excluding respondents with unusable answers and from other countries than France,
we ended with 11,391 questionnaires (56.6%) for analysis. After weighting, 47.5% of
participants were men, 52.1% were women, and 0.5% were other (Table 1). Mean
weighted age was 47.47 ± 17.28 years and mean WEMWBS score was 50.51 ± 8.17
(Table 1).
Personal and environmental situation during lockdown
Among the participants, 62.34% had housing with an outdoor space (mean surface
area = 75.4 ± 37.2 m2). Those living alone comprised 27.73% of participants, while
72.10% lived with at least one other individual. Finally, 15.41% left their homes for
work and 33.97% telecommuted. Table 2 summarizes all lockdown situations and
corresponding WEMWBS total scores.
Factors associated with mental wellbeing
Multivariate analyses indicated that being male, having a partner, and being more
educated predicted greater wellbeing (Table 3). Conversely, having a child under 10
was associated with lower wellbeing. Age was positively correlated with wellbeing.

Students and people with disabilities that prevented them from working exhibited the
lowest wellbeing scores, whereas retired individuals and healthcare providers had the
highest scores. House surface area was positively correlated with wellbeing; in
particular, people with access to an outdoor space had higher wellbeing. Wellbeing
was also greater among participants who could go to work, had social support, or
engaged in higher frequency of social contact via telephone or texting (excluding
social media).
Discussion
We report the results of the first nationwide survey on mental wellbeing in a Western
European country, at the early stage of global lockdown during the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic. We identified concerning inequities in citizen wellbeing. Notably, students,
people with disabilities, and people confined in small spaces with no outdoor access
all exhibited lower WEMWBS scores. In contrast, we found greater wellbeing among
retired individuals, healthcare professionals, people who could still go to a workplace
(instead of telecommuting), and those with more social contacts.
These results are partially in line with other studies on wellbeing during normal (nonpandemic) situations7,8, most notably for people with disabilities. However, student
WEMWBS scores are far lower than previous research indicates. In a former study,
both individual and institutional (i.e., linked to universities) elements could influence
student mental health9. In the current context, the French student population is faced
with cumulative effects from the lockdown: social rupture, closure of universities, and
uncertainty about their academic performance10. A global lockdown introduces
considerable unpredictability for student futures, warranting clear strategies and
public messages of hope from the administration and government.

Special consideration should also be given for individuals who live in tiny apartments
without outdoor space, especially in urban areas where higher population density
makes social distancing difficult, meaning that these inhabitants have few alternatives
for maintaining physical activity. Moreover, our results suggest that as lockdowns
restrict access to more workplaces, authorities should recommend maintaining social
contact via phone and texting.
Finally, as mental wellbeing influences health-related behaviors (e.g., activity and
food intake), tracking mental health in the early phase of a global lockdown can
inform targeted strategies for improving health and wellbeing among specific
subpopulations during and after the pandemic11.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, respondents may not be representative of the
whole French population due to the sampling method. However, the large sample
size and weighting of major sociodemographic characteristics reduce this selection
bias. Second, numerous variables influence mental wellbeing, and we are aware that
this brief report only included a few of them. Further studies will examine the impact
of global lockdown in France and worldwide with greater granularity, but currently
there is an urgent need to inform authorities on early determinants affecting mental
wellbeing.
Conclusions
In this French nationwide survey during the second week of global lockdown
responding to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we show that mental wellbeing is lower for
people with pre-existing vulnerabilities (i.e., disabilities), those who live in
environmental conditions that exacerbate social-distancing-related stress (i.e., small

spaces), and individuals who are disproportionately affected by uncertainties
stemming from the shuttering of institutions (e.g., students). Increased vigilance is
warranted in these subpopulations. Policymakers should keep these data in mind
when making decisions related to lockdown and post-lockdown strategies.
