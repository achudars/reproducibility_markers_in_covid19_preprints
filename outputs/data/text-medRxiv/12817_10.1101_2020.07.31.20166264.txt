Abstract
Background: Quarantine of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID -19 confirmed
cases is a well-known strategy for limiting the transmission of infection. However, there is
need of evidence-based guidelines for quarantine of HCWs in COVID -19.
Methods: We describe our experience of contact tracing and risk stratification of 3853
HCWs who were exposed to confirmed COVID-19 cases in a tertiary health care institution
in India. We developed an algorithm, on the basis of risk stratification, to rationalize quarantine
among HCWs. Risk stratification was based on the duration of exposure, distance from the

patient, and appropriateness of personal protection equipment (PPE) usage. Only high-risk
contacts were quarantined for 14 days. They underwent testing for COVID-19 after five days
of exposure, while low-risk contacts continued their work with adherence to physical
distancing, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of PPE. The low-risk contacts were encouraged
to monitor for symptoms and report for COVID-19 screening if fever, cough, or shortness of
breath occurred. We followed up all contacts for 14 days from the last exposure and observed
for symptoms of COVID-19 and test positivity.
Results and interpretation: Out of total 3853 contacts, 560 (14.5%) were categorized as
high-risk contacts, and 40 of them were detected positive for COVID-19, with a test
positivity rate of 7.1% (95% CI = 5.2 – 9.6). Overall, 118 (3.1%) of all contacts tested
positive. Our strategy prevented 3215 HCWs from being quarantined and saved 45,010
person-days of health workforce until June 8, 2020, in the institution.
We conclude that exposure-based risk stratification and quarantine of HCWs is a viable
strategy to prevent unnecessary quarantine, in a healthcare institution.

Summary
What is already known about this subject?
•

Quarantine of HCWs is a well-known strategy for community and HCWs to prevent the
transmission of COVID-19.

•

Though success stories of prompt contact tracing and quarantine to control COVID-19 are
available from countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, there is a scarcity of
evidence that could guide targeted quarantine of HCWs exposed to COVID -19 in India.

What does this study add?
•

Only 14.5% HCWs exposed to COVID-19 cases were stratified “high risk” contacts, and the most
common reason for high-risk contacts was non-formal workplace interactions such as having
meals together.

•

The overall test positivity rate among the high-risk contacts was 7.1%, while it was higher in
symptomatic high-risk contacts as compared to those who were asymptomatic (10.2% vs. 6.3%).

How might this impact on clinical practice?
•

Contact tracing and risk stratification can be used to minimize unnecessary quarantine of COVID19 exposed health care workers and prevent the depletion of healthcare workers amidst the
pandemic to continue the healthcare services optimally.

Introduction
In India, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is on the rise ever since the first case was
detected on January 30, 2020 (1). As of July 16, 2020, the numbers of COVID-19 cases crossed one
million mark with more than 25,000 deaths (2). With the progression of pandemic, the risk of
exposure of health care workers (HCWs) to COVID-19 patients was increasing. Transmission of
COVID-19 infection to HCWs in health care settings weaken the health care delivery systems at such
crucial times. It is further underscored by the high numbers of deaths of HCWs due to COVID-19
across the globe (4).
Case investigation, contact tracing, and quarantine remain an essential public health tool for
controlling infectious disease outbreaks (5). The decision regarding whom to quarantine is of utmost
importance. Irrational or unnecessary quarantine may lead to a shortage of workforce adversely
impacting health care services. Whereas, not quarantining those at high risk of infection following
COVID-19 case exposure may potentially lead to transmission of infection to other HCWs and
patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) issued interim recommendations for protection and quarantine of HCWs from time
to time (6,7). Consequently, the Government of India also changed its quarantine policies (8,9).
Though success stories of prompt contact tracing and quarantine to control COVID-19 are available
from countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong, there was a dearth of evidence that
could guide targeted quarantine in India (10-12). In the initial phases of the pandemic, there was a
constraint of testing facilities. Therefore, we developed an algorithm, which was based on risk
stratification, to rationalize quarantine among HCWs. We report, in this paper, our experience of
quarantining the HCWs based on contact tracing and risk stratification in a tertiary care centre in
India.

Methods
Study setting: This study was conducted at a tertiary health care institution, namely the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. In the institution, the hospital premises and
the patient care areas were divided into COVID-19 designated areas and non-COVID-19 areas for
infection control measures. A vast majority of HCWs were employees of the institution who were
covered under the Government of India’s leave rules. However, some of the sanitation staff and
hospital attendants were procured from a manpower contractor. These employees, we understand,
were paid only for the period for which they provided services.
The COVID areas included an out-patient screening facility, an in-patient facility for management of
cases, and a critical care facility for COVID patients. The institution had a designated virology
laboratory for testing of COVID-19, which was approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research.

A team of expert virologists conducted the qRT-PCR for SARS Coronavirus 2. The test results were
made available online within 24 hours of sample collection.
The Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) of the institution prepared the guidelines for
infection control. It made recommendations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in
different areas of patient care. Adequate training of all HCWs in donning and doffing of PPE, social
distancing, terminal cleaning, and routine disinfection was imparted. Nodal officers were appointed in
each department to ensure the implementation of infection control practices.
Study design: Case ascertainment-based cohort study
Study period: April 11 to June 8, 2020
Study participants: We included all HCWs and other employees of the institution who exposed with
another person, (including patients, their attendants, and hospital staff) who had tested positive for
COVID-19 at the institution.
Contract tracing process and development of risk assessment tool
Central Contact Tracing Team (CCTT)
The CCTT was a multidisciplinary team, which consisted of experts from community medicine,
infectious disease, hospital administration, internal medicine, and nursing. The team reviewed the
existing literature on COVID-19 risk assessment, and prepared risk stratification criteria by
synthesizing and adapting the guidelines of the WHO, Centres for Disease Control (CDC), and other
evidence available in the scientific literature (7,13,14).
Protocol for Reporting of cases and Contact Tracing
Whenever a COVID-19 positive case was reported from any area of the institution, the concerned
doctor-in charge or nodal officer at the respective department contacted the CCTT. A central helpline
telephone number for CCTT was also created. The affected employee could also directly report to
CCTT by calling on this helpline number. The CCTT carried out epidemiological investigation for all
COVID-19 positive cases. The period for the investigation started from 48 hours before the onset of
the symptoms among symptomatic cases or 48 hours before the collection of nasopharyngeal swab
among asymptomatic cases. It ended at the date when COVID-19 test results became available. We
interviewed the cases and checked their duty roster for preparing the list of contacts. Information from
all the listed contacts was gathered either through face-to-face or telephonic interview.
Procedure for testing and follow up of contacts
The high-risk contacts were advised quarantine for 14 days and tested at the institution on the fifth
day after exposure. All HCWs categorized as low risk but who became symptomatic during 14 days

of follow up also underwent COVID-19 testing. The low-risk asymptomatic contacts continued to
work, with adherence to standard precautions. All contacts were followed for 14 days after the last
day of exposure to the COVID19 case.
Operational definitions
COVID-19 confirmed case
A person who tested positive for COVID-19 by qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test, conducted at the virology laboratory of the institution, or at any other
laboratory approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).
Risk Stratification
High-risk contacts: Contact with a confirmed case with any of the following:
1. Performed a respiratory Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) without ANY one of the
following – N95 face mask, eye/face protection, gloves.
2. If the patient’s body fluids, or respiratory tract secretions, or saliva came in contact with
non-intact skin or mucous membrane.
3. Present within 1 meter of the confirmed case without a mask (both case and contact) for
more than 15 minutes.
4.

Household contacts of a known positive case

Low-risk contacts: All contacts other than “high risk” contacts were classified as low-risk contacts.
Symptomatic contact: Any contact having symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, such as fever, cough,
or breathing difficulty at the time of risk assessment.
Asymptomatic contact: Any contact without COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or breathing
difficulty when risk was assessed, irrespective of the development of symptoms later during 14 days
follow-up period.
Statistical Analysis: Data were entered and managed in MS Excel 2016, and statistical analysis was
carried out using STATA 12.0 (Stata Corp LLC 4905, Texas, USA). Results were presented as
frequencies or proportions and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Ethical Considerations: The Institute Ethics Committee approved the study. Informed verbal consent
was taken on the phone from the participants. The information collected was kept confidential and
unique identifiers were removed before analysis.

Results
A total of 321 COVID-19 positive cases were reported to the CCTT during the study period. Of the
321 cases, 238 (74.1%) were HCWs and other employees, while 83 (25.9%) were patients admitted in
non-COVID areas due to other medical conditions. Among the COVID-19 positive HCWs, the largest
proportion was contributed by hospital attendants and sanitation workers (n = 84; 35.3%), followed by
nurses (n=41; 17.2%), and security personnel (n=32; 13.3%). Doctors and laboratory staff contributed
similar proportion i.e. approximately 12.2% (n= 29) each. Others included administrative staff (n = 13
(5.5%), and staff like driver, cook, food bearer etc. (n = 11; 4.6%).
The CCTT tracked 3,853 hospital employees who exposed to these 321 COVID-19 cases, both
patients as well as other HCWs, during the period from April 11 to June 8, 2020 (Figure 1). On risk
stratification, 560 (14.5%) contacts were classified as “high risk” and 3,293 (85.5%) as “low risk”
contacts. The mean number of contacts for an index case was 13.5. The maximum number of contacts
associated with a single case was 87, out of which 21 (24%) were high risk.
The two most common reasons for high-risk exposure (~40% each) were informal workplace
interactions (not related to patient care), and during routine work being without mask and not
maintaining physical distance. Other reasons included patient care without appropriate PPE, cleaning,
or housekeeping activities without adequate PPE (Table 1). In some cases, there were multiple
reasons for high-risk exposure. In the patient care settings, the high-risk exposure was largely due to
non-use of appropriate PPE, e.g., performing aerosol-generating procedures without eye/face
protection, not performing hand hygiene after the examination or inconsistent use of N 95 mask.
Of the total 3,853 contacts, 118 (3.1%) tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Among the 560
high-risk contacts, 40 (7.1%; 95% CI 5.2– 9.6) became COVID-19 positive during the quarantine
period. The positivity rate among the symptomatic high-risk contacts was higher (10.2 %; 95% CI 5.5
– 16.7) compared to those who were asymptomatic (6.3%, 95% CI 3.9 – 8.5). Similarly, the positivity
rate among the low-risk symptomatic contacts was higher (5.3%, 95% CI 3.0 – 8.7) compared to lowrisk asymptomatic contact (2.1% (95% CI 1.6 - 2.6) (Table 2).

Discussion
We followed up a total of 3,853 contacts, i.e., the HCWs who were exposed to COVID-19 cases.
Most of the contacts (85.5%) had “low risk” exposure as per the risk stratification criteria. During the
14 days of the quarantine period, 118 contacts (3.1%, 95% CI 2.5 – 3.7) became COVID-19 positive.
The test positivity rate is a proxy indicator for secondary attack rate (SAR) of COVID-19. It is higher
in our study than the SAR (1.56%, 95% CI = 0.73 – 2.93) reported by nationwide contact tracing data
from Taiwan (14). This indicates the relatively rapid progression of COVID-19 pandemic in our
institution.

We observed a clear trend in the positivity rate with the highest rate among high-risk symptomatic
contacts and lowest among low-risk asymptomatic contacts. Still, the test positivity rate among lowrisk asymptomatic contacts was 2.1%. The risk stratification was based on history. It is possible that
sanitation staff and hospital attendants supplied by manpower contractors feared that if they were
classified as high risk, there would be mandatory quarantine and they would lose wages for that
duration. Hence, some of them might have deliberately given an incorrect history of exposure. If this
were to be true, then the utility of the tool would further improve in situations where paid leave is
allowed for the quarantine period.
We did not physically verify the COVID-19 test status of individual HCWs. Instead, we had assumed
that anyone testing positive would be notified to the CCTT. HCWs for which no positive report was
communicated to CCTT were deemed to be COVID-19 negative. However, there could be some
HCWs who had tested positive but were not notified to us. Therefore, the observed positivity rate
would be an underestimate. We believe that the notification system at the institution was sufficiently
robust. The underestimation, if any, is likely to be small enough so as not to challenge the validity of
findings seriously.
While calculating the positivity rate, we had assumed that all contacts were susceptible at the time of
exposure. However, some of them might already have had protective antibodies. It would be
particularly true because a substantial proportion of COVID infection is reported to be asymptomatic.
Such a situation would result in an underestimation of the positivity rate. We had assumed that none
of the contacts were in the incubation period of COVID infection at the time of their exposure. If the
HCW was truly in the incubation period, then s/he would have tested positive irrespective of current
exposure. Under such a scenario, the observed the positivity rate would be an overestimate of the true
situation. We could not find any published literature that could assist in estimating the quantum of
such overestimate. However, we feel that the number of HCWs that could have been in the incubation
period of COVID infection is likely to be small and not vitiate the findings of this study.
Through the risk stratification tool, we aimed to identify those exposed HCWs that required
quarantine to protect patients and other HCWs from potential infection. Simultaneously, we also
aimed to avoid unnecessary quarantine of those HCWs that were likely to be uninfected, and thereby
prevent workforce depletion. Incorrectly labelling an HCW as low risk and thereby allowing her/him
to continue to work rather than being quarantined, entailed serious consequences to co-workers and
patients. It was preferable to err on the side of caution at the cost of loss of workforce. The test
positivity rate among low risk symptomatic (5.3%) was closer to the high-risk group (7.1%) compared
to low risk asymptomatic (2.1%). If we convert the test positivity rate among low-risk asymptomatic
contacts in numbers, it will be a substantial number. These asymptomatic contacts may further
transmit the infection to others, which is evident from the literature (15). The asymptomatic

transmission of COVID-19 remains a major challenge for the protection of HCWs and the curb of
pandemic progression. Thus, all low-risk asymptomatic contacts were advised to observe adherence to
precautions such as physical distancing, hand hygiene and PPE as appropriate, so that in case of an
error in stratification, they do not pose the risk of transmission to others and avoid further resurgence
of COVID-19 cases.
We found that informal interactions such as having snacks/meals together was one of the most
common reasons for high-risk exposure among the contacts. Our findings support the WHO
guidelines that had emphasized the exposure in the common dining facilities (16). We, therefore,
suggest that an appropriate dining facility that would enable maintenance of proper physical distance
should be provided at health care facilities. Other measures to avoid overcrowding may include
restricting the number of persons inside the dining room at any given point of time. Staggering the
lunch timings could be yet another such measure. We also recommend that during training program of
the HCW for infection control practices, the risk due to dining together may be emphasized.
Our risk stratification strategy prevented the depletion of human resources for continuing healthcare
services. In our study, 560 contacts were high risk. They were eligible quarantine for 14 days. Of the
low-risk contacts (3293), 78 tested positive and thus quarantined. Therefore, this strategy prevented
3215 HCWs from quarantine following exposure and saved 45,010 person-days till June 8, 2020. In
contrast, all contacts irrespective of the risk status were quarantined in most healthcare institutions,
particularly in the facilities with constraint resources for testing. It led to severe depletion of the
workforce, and subsequently, shut down of many healthcare institutions in worse affected cities,
Mumbai and Delhi (17–20).
Strengths: We employed multiple strategies, including personal interview and review of records, to
prepare the list of contacts of exposed HCW. We, therefore, feel that all potential contacts were listed
and tracked. Thus, the data quality was expected to be satisfactory. The testing for COVID infection
was done at an accredited laboratory. All quarantined participants were contacted, and history
obtained at the end of 14 days of follow up.
Limitations: The risk stratification was based on the history provided by the participant. Recall and
social desirability bias, therefore, could not be ruled out. Deliberate misinformation was also a
possibility, particularly where participants feared that if quarantined, they could lose wages for that
period. Sanitation staff and hospital attendants that were provided by an external agency were more
likely to fall into this category.

Conclusions
The risk stratification tool developed by us served its intended purpose of correctly categorizing the
risk category of exposure, as well as minimizing unnecessary quarantine of COVID-19 exposed
