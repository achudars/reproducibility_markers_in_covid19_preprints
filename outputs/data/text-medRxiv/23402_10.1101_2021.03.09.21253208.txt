ABSTRACT
Background
Lung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary
peripheral patterns and may allow early identification of patients who are likely to develop an
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed
during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk
of getting worse.

Methods
POCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were
admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were
included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of
lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The
primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days
following inclusion.

Results
Among 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve
(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The
score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity
> 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and ≥16, respectively. The rate of patients with
an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus
4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17
(23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score ≥16). In patients with confirmed
COVID-19 (n=58), the AUC of L-POCUS was 0.97 [95%CI:0.92-1.00].

Conclusions
L-POCUS allows risk-stratification of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
These results should be confirmed in a population with a higher risk of an unfavorable
outcome.

ARTICLE

BACKGROUND

The COVID-19 pandemic has developed worldwide since its emergence in China in
December 2019.[1–3] The majority of patients has a mild or uncomplicated course (81%)
with minor symptoms such as headache, loss of smell, or cough. However, around 14% of
patients develop respiratory symptoms and require hospitalization.[4] Median time from
illness onset to dyspnea is 6 to 8 days and around 5% of the patients develop acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), usually between Day 7 and Day 10.[4–6] The rapid progression of
respiratory failure soon after the onset of dyspnea is a striking feature of COVID-19.[7],[8]
There is an urgent need for reliable tools which can identify patients who are likely to get
worse and develop ARDS early on.

Pulmonary computed tomography (CT-scan) appears to be very sensitive (97%) and quite
specific for diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients with a clinical suspicion, provided that it is not
performed within the first 4 days after symptom onset.[9,10] COVID-19 manifests itself on
CT-scans as bilateral, subpleural, ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, and illdefined margins.[11] Those patterns can precede the positivity of the Reverse TranscriptasePolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.[12,13]

Lung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is a simple, non-invasive, non-irradiating,
inexpensive imaging tool that is available at the bedside and used more and more by
emergency physicians in their everyday clinical practice. L-POCUS seems to be better than
chest X-ray in detecting pneumonia and may be an alternative to the CT-scan as a screening
and prognostic tool.[14] Indeed, L-POCUS is highly effective in detecting peripheral patterns
and pleural abnormalities, and seems appropriate for triaging COVID-19 patients.[15] A
recent review highlights its potential value in decision making for triage or follow-up.[16]
Many physicians have placed their hopes in this device, as shown by the number of
publications reporting personal experiences or case reports but few prospective studies have
been carried out on this topic, and, to our knowledge, no robust data have been yet provided
on the prognostic value of L-POCUS in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study is to determine the performance of L-POCUS at the time of ED
admission in identifying, among patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19,
those who are at high-risk of adverse outcomes such as respiratory failure or death.

METHODS

Study design and participants
The point-of-care ultrasonography for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients’ study
(POCUSCO) was a non-interventional, prospective, multicenter study that was conducted in
11 participating hospitals in France and Belgium.
Patients were enrolled if they met all of the following criteria: (1) adult patients (≥ 18 years
old); (2) typical COVID-19 symptoms and at least one of the three following features: i)
positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, ii) typical CT-scan lesions, iii) COVID-19 is the main
diagnostic hypothesis by the in-charge physician; (3) no requirement for respiratory support
and/or other intensive care, and not subject to a limitation of care; (4) membership of a social
security scheme.
Patients for whom the follow-up at Day 14 was impossible or who had a condition making
lung ultrasonography impossible (body mass index > 35 kg/m², history of pneumonectomy)
were excluded.
The initial evaluation was carried out by the physician-in-charge and patients were treated as
standard.[17] All participating patients underwent L-POCUS and a score reflecting the
intensity and the extension of lung involvement was determined.[18] This score was
previously developed for ARDS (see below).[18,19] For patients who were subsequently
hospitalized, a second L-POCUS was performed on Day 5 ± 3 under the same conditions as
the first one, whenever it was possible.
Patients were followed up by phone at Day 14 and their clinical status recorded according to
the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement for COVID-19 from the World Health
Organization (WHO-OSCI) (Table 1).[20]

Objectives and outcomes
The main objective was to assess the ability of L-POCUS to identify COVID-19 patients with
a high-risk of an unfavorable outcome. The primary endpoint was the development of severe
COVID-19 within the 14 days after ED admission defined as a stage of the WHO-OSCI ≥ 6.
This stage relates to a severe inpatient requiring intubation and invasive ventilation (stage 6),
and/or additional organ support (stage 7) or who died whatever the cause (stage 8). The
ability of L-POCUS to predict the primary outcome occurrence was evaluated by the area
under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its 95%
confidence interval (95%CI). A sensitivity analysis was performed with the 14-day all-cause
mortality rate as the outcome.

The secondary objectives were:
1) To determine the threshold values of L-POCUS to perform risk stratification in three
groups of patients: low-risk patients, intermediate-risk patients, and high-risk patients.
2) To assess the impact of adding the result of POCUS evaluation to two risk-stratification
clinical scores: the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) and the CRB65.[21,22]
3) To assess the impact of the knowledge and experience of the operator level (novice,
confirmed or expert) on the L-POCUS performance.
We performed a subgroup analysis in patients for whom the diagnosis of COVID-19 was
initially or subsequently confirmed by a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.

Lung point-of-care ultrasonography
L-POCUS was performed with ultrasound scanners using low frequency (2-5 MHz)
transductors, convex or small linear type probes. The Bedside Lung Ultrasound in an
Emergency (BLUE)-Protocol was applied to patients in erect or semi-recumbent positions
depending on dyspnea severity (Figure 1).[19] Each chest wall was divided by the anterior
and posterior axillary lines into anterior, lateral, or posterior regions. All intercostal spaces of
the upper and lower parts of these regions were examined, resulting in a total of 12 areas of
investigation. Each area was examined for at least one complete respiratory cycle. Four
ultrasound aeration patterns were defined and scored 0 to 3, allowing calculation of the LPOCUS score, theoretically ranging from 0 to 36 (Figure 1).[18,23] Considering biological
risk of infection, special protective precautions were taken to protect the operator and other
patients as recommended.[24]

Ethics and financials
This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, as amended. The
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee CPP Sud-Ouest et Outre-Mer II for France
(No. 2020-A00782-37 / 2-20-025 id7566) and the Ethics Committee of the Cliniques
Universitaires Saint-Luc for Belgium (No. 2020/14AVR/223). Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. The study was funded by a grant from the French Ministry of
Health (PHRC-I, April 2020, COVID19_A_001). This study adheres to STROBE guidelines,
and all its details have been verified before submitting the manuscript.[25]

Statistical analyses
Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation values. Categorical
variables were described using numbers, percentages and their 95% confidence intervals
(95%CI). The AUCs and their 95% confidence interval were determined by the .632 bootstrap
method. For the primary outcome, we determined in advance that the L-POCUS prognostic
value would be considered as clinically relevant with a good level of evidence if the lower
bound of the 95%CI of the AUC was equal to or greater than 0.7. To perform risk
stratification in three groups of patients with a low, intermediate, or high-risk of an
unfavorable outcome, two thresholds were calculated. The first maximized specificity with a
sensitivity greater than or equal to 95% and the second maximized sensitivity with a
specificity greater than or equal to 95%. For these threshold values, sensitivity, specificity,
predictive values and likelihood ratios were assessed. To study the impact of adding the
results of the L-POCUS evaluation to several risk stratification clinical rules for pulmonary
infection or sepsis (qSOFA and CRB65), AUCs were compared with or without their
components with a DeLong test. For this purpose, we attributed 0, 1, or 2 points in the LPOCUS result as low, moderate or high risk according to the predefined threshold values and
assessed the AUC of the risk-stratification rules with and without adding the L-POCUS result
value. Assuming a rate of death or tracheal intubation requirement of 10%, and expecting an
AUC of 0.8, the number of patients required to achieve a lower limit of the 95%CI, more than
0.7, was estimated as 286. Taking into consideration that 5% of patients were not followed up
or could not be evaluated, the sample size was defined as 300 patients. Missing data were not
imputed. A descriptive analysis of missing data was performed and compared to the available
data to assess a potential bias. All statistical analyzes were performed using STATA, version
14.2; StataCorp; College Station, TX.

RESULTS

Characteristics of study population
A total of 307 patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in
this study. Among them, 2 were subsequently excluded and 9 were could not be followed up
(2.93%) leaving 296 patients for the main analyses (Figure 2). The mean age of the overall
population was 57 years (± 20.8), and 146 (47.6%) were men (Table 2). The more common
symptoms of COVID-19 were dyspnea (n=230 [74.9%]) cough (n=193 [62.9%]), abnormal
thoracic auscultation (n=149 [48.5%]) and chest pain (n=125 [40.7%]).
The L-POCUS was performed by an emergency physician considered an expert, an advanced
technician and a novice in 32.2% (n=99), 44.3% (n=133) and 24.4% (n=75) of cases
respectively. A CT-scan was performed on 170 patients (55.4%) and 40 patients (22.9%) had
a second L-POCUS at Day 5 ± 3.

Outcomes in the overall population
The results of the L-POCUS are outlined in Figure 3. At Day 14, among 296 analyzable
patients, the main outcome occurred in 8 (2,7%) patients (seven were dead and one patient
had required intubation and invasive ventilation). The AUC of L-POCUS was 0.80 (95%CI:
0.60-0.94) (Figure 4). The lower value of the 95% CI did not achieve the predefined value of
0.7 necessary to consider the performance of L-POCUS as clinically relevant. In the
sensitivity analysis with the 14-day all-cause mortality rate as an outcome, the AUC of LPOCUS was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.66-1).
The AUC slightly increased according to the experience of the POCUS operator without
significant difference: 0.86 (95%CI: 0.70-0.99), 0.82 (95%CI: 0.34-1) and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.560.78), for experts, confirmed or novices, respectively.

The highest L-POCUS with a sensitivity of at least 95% was 0 point and the lowest value with
a specificity of at least 95% was 16 points. Using these cutoffs, 95 patients (32.1%) had a
low-risk (score =0) and none of them had an unfavorable outcome at Day 14 (0% [95%CI:
0.0-3.9]; Sensitivity 100% [95%CI: 63.1-100.0]; Specificity 33.0% [95%CI: 27.6-38.7];
Positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 1.49 [95%CI: 1.4-1.6]; Negative likelihood ratio (LR-) 0;
Positive predictive value (PPV) 3.9% [95%CI: 3.7-4.3]; Negative predictive value (NPV)
100%). 184 patients (62.4%) had intermediate-risk (score 1 to 15) and, among them, 4 (2.17%
[95%CI: 0.8-5.5]) had an unfavorable outcome (Positive likelihood ratio (LR+) 0.8 [95%CI:
0.5-1.3]; Negative likelihood ratio (LR-) 1.33 [95%CI: 0.8-2.1]). Finally, 17 patients (5.7%)
had a high-risk (score ≥ 16) and, among them, 4 (23.5%) had an unfavorable outcome at Day
14 (23.5% [95%CI: 11.4-42.4]; Sensitivity 50% [95%CI: 15.7-84.3]; Specificity 95.5%
[95%CI: 92.4-97.6]; LR+ 11.1 [95%CI: 4.6-26.5]; LR- 0.5 [95%CI: 0.3-1.1]; PPV 23.5%
[95%CI: 11.4-42.4]; NPV 98.6% [95%CI: 97.2-99.3]).

The AUCs of the risk prediction clinical rules qSOFA and CRB65 with and without addition
of the L-POCUS score were 0.75 [95%CI: 0.56 to 0.94] and 0.52 [95%CI: 0.32 to 0.71], and
0.82 [95%CI: 0.68 to 0.99] and 0.72 [95%CI: 0.49 to 0.95], respectively.

Patients with Positive SARS-CoV-2
Among 240 patients tested (78.2%), 58 (24.2%) had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2. At
Day 14, 4 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were dead (4/58, 6.9%). The AUC of L-

POCUS was 0.97 (95%CI: 0.92 – 1.00). Using the two thresholds defined in the overall
cohort, L-POCUS determined 6 patients (10.5%) with low-risk and none of them had an
unfavorable outcome at Day 14 (0% [95%CI: 0 to 21.5]; Sensitivity 100% [95%CI: 39.8100]; Specificity 11.3% [95%CI: 4.3-23.0]). 43 patients (75.4%) presented an intermediaterisk and none of them had an unfavorable outcome (0% [95%CI: 0-8.2]). Among 8 patients
(14.0%) presenting a high-risk, 4 had an unfavorable outcome (50.0% [95%CI: 23.7-76.3Sensitivity 50% [95%CI: 15.7-84.3]; Specificity 92.0% [95%CI: 80.8-97.8].

DISCUSSION

In our prospective POCUSCO study of non-severe patients with confirmed or suspected
COVID-19, L-POCUS has had good results in predicting the occurrence of death or
requirement for invasive ventilation within the 14 days following ED admission and it appears
to be a promising tool for risk stratification. However, because of a lower-than-expected rate
of patients with an unfavorable outcome, the confidence intervals of our estimates are wide
with an upper value of the AUC not achieving the predefined value of 0.7 to consider the LPOCUS prognostic value as clinically relevant with a good level of evidence.
Based on its performance in diagnosing pneumonia and ARDS, L-POCUS ought to be a
useful diagnostic and risk stratification tool in the initial assessment of suspected COVID-19
patients.[14,26,27] It is currently considered an alternative to physical examination for
suspected COVID-19 patients in the emergency department.[27] However, this position is
mainly based on expert opinion and few trials have been published. Moreover, most of them
are monocentric studies assessing the correlation of L-POCUS with chest CT scans in
detecting lung abnormalities suggestive of COVID-19 and/or its value in diagnosing patients
with suspected COVID-19. Globally, they suggest a high sensitivity at around 90% but with
a low specificity at around 25%, depending on disease prevalence.[28,29] Those estimates are
greater than the first RT-PCR value.[29] L-POCUS would provide an effective estimate of
the extent of the pulmonary histological damage.[30]
To our knowledge, only one previous study assessed the performance of L-POCUS in
identifying patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at risk of deteriorating. Indeed,
Bonadia et al. conducted a prospective study in 41 COVID-19 patients and showed the higher
the rate, the higher the in-hospital mortality and need for intensive care admission.[31] Our
results therefore provide further important data regarding prognostication and triage with LPOCUS.

Ultrasonography including L-POCUS was questioned for its lack of reproducibility, being
dependent on the examiner. To avoid this pitfall, standardized procedures have been
proposed.[32] We used a revised BLUE protocol previously validated in patients with
ARDS.[18] Based on the screening of twelve chest areas and on weighting with four aeration
patterns, this score is quick and easy to achieve, which is particularly relevant in the
Emergency Department and in the context of the strain on health resources.[18] Aeration

patterns are easy to recognize and the use in our study of pocket cards with the L-POCUS
score (Figure 1) make it easy for most emergency physicians to apply. It is important to note
that in previous studies, L-POCUS were performed by experienced emergency physicians, all
certified for lung ultrasound.[33,34] In our trial, nearly a quarter of the exams were performed
by novices physicians without any significant difference in terms of the AUC of L-POCUS
from the exams performed by experts. Indeed, a short training with 25 supervised L-POCUS
helps novices acquire skills in L-POCUS.[35]

With an AUC of 0.80, the global performance of L-POCUS is good in our overall population
and similar results were observed by considering only patients who died as an outcome. They
are even better in the subgroup of patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2, the lower
limit of the AUC being higher than 0.9. These results are particularly relevant in the current
context of organized mass screening. Unlike at the start of the pandemic, most of the patients
consulting the ED have the results of testing or could benefit from a quick test for COVID-19.
Moreover, recent data suggest that "thickening of the pleural lining, may be an important
pattern for L-POCUS assessment of the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.[36] The inclusion
of this criterion in a revised version of the score in a future study may improve the riskstratification performance of L-POCUS for COVID-19 patients.

In terms of implementing L-POCUS as a triaging tool in every day clinical practice, we aimed
to stratify the result into three risk categories. None of the 95 patients who were determined
to be low-risk (L-POCUS score = 0) suffered significant deterioration and home treatment
may be suitable for these patients, if they lack comorbidities or a living condition which
precludes this option. It is important to note that only one patient with a L-POCUS score < 6
had an unfavorable outcome within the 14 days following ED admission. This patient was not
positive with SARS-CoV-2 and died from pulmonary malignancy. On the other hand, 4 of 17
patients determined as high risk (score ≥ 16) died. All of them had a positive RT-PCR SARSCoV-2 and died from COVID-19. Nevertheless, these results must be considered carefully
before using L-POCUS in the early triage of COVID-19 patients, at least as a standalone tool.

In our trial the prognostic performance of the qSOFA and CRB-65 were low but the addition
of the L-POCUS to these clinical rules slightly improved their performance in terms of the
AUC: +0.23 for qSOFA and +0.1 for CRB-65. These results are in line with the study of Bar
et al showing that a model combining the qSOFA and 4 ultrasound findings has good value as

a diagnostic tool (AUC: 0.82 [95%CI: 0.75 – 0.90]) of.[37] The best result was obtained with
CRB-65 + L-POCUS with an AUC of 0.82 [95%CI: 0.68 to 0.99]. However, the lower limit
of the 95%CI did not achieve the prespecified level of 0.7.

To our knowledge, POCUSCO is the largest multicentric, prospective study evaluating LPOCUS to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, it has some limitations, one of the
more important being the low primary endpoint rate. On the basis of the first cohorts of
COVID-19 inpatients, we considered a rate of mortality or invasive ventilation requirement of
10%, at the time the protocol was written.[38] It was actually 7% in confirmed COVID-19
patients and only 2.4% in our overall cohort. Several factors may explain this discrepancy:
differences in the completeness of testing and case identification, variable thresholds for
hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit admission, and improvement in patients’ care.[39]
Moreover, only a quarter of participating patients had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2,
the other patients may have had a minor form of COVID-19 or another less severe disease.
Nevertheless, our results are in line with the 1.4% mortality rate and 2.3% rate of patients who
underwent invasive mechanical ventilation in the cohort of Guan et al.[4] Finally, in the
absence of a derivation model, it is not methodologically justified to assess the calibration of
L-POCUS.[18] Another study must be carried out to validate our results on an independent
cohort.

INTERPRETATION

L-POCUS allows risk-stratification of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Using a
36-points score initially defined for ARDS, L-POCUS determined patients with an exact score
of to be low-risk and patients with a score ≥ 16 to be high-risk of death or of requiring
invasive ventilation. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to determine
whether a global multimodal model, integrating L-POCUS score value and other
considerations, would enable the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients more precisely than
the L-POCUS score alone.
