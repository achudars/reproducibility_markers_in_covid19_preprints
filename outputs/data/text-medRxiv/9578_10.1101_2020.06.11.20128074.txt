Estimating the impact of physical distancing measures in containing COVID-19:
an empirical analysis

Abstract
Background
Epidemic modelling studies predict that physical distancing is critical in containing COVID-19. However,
few empirical studies have validated this finding. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of different
physical distancing measures in controlling viral transmission.
Methods
We identified three distinct physical distancing measures with varying intensity and implemented at
different times—international travel controls, restrictions on mass gatherings, and lockdown-type
measures—based on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. We also estimated the timevarying reproduction number (Rt) for 142 countries and tracked Rt temporally for two weeks following
the 100th reported case in each country. We regressed Rt on the physical distancing measures and other
control variables (income, population density, age structure, and temperature) and performed several
robustness checks to validate our findings.
Findings
Complete travel bans and all forms of lockdown-type measures have been effective in reducing average
Rt over the 14 days following the 100th case. Recommended stay-at-home advisories and partial
lockdowns are as effective as complete lockdowns in outbreak control. However, these measures have
to be implemented early to be effective. Lockdown-type measures should be instituted two weeks
before the 100th case and travel bans about a week before detection of the first case.
Interpretation
A combination of physical distancing measures, if implemented early, can be effective in containing
COVID-19—tight border controls to limit importation of cases, encouraging physical distancing,
moderately stringent measures such as working from home, and a full lockdown in the case of a
probable uncontrolled outbreak.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evidence on the impact of physical distancing measures on containing COVID-19 has primarily relied on
epidemic modelling studies. As cases accumulate worldwide, it has become possible to use empirical
data to validate the model-based findings. The few empirical studies that analyze global case data find
that lockdowns and international travel restrictions are important, but have not explored, beyond these
broad findings, the intensity and timeliness of the various measures to inform policymaking.
Added value of this study
We assessed, at a normalized stage of the epidemic curve, how the intensity and implementation timing
of various physical distancing measures in 142 countries affect viral transmission, measured by the timevarying reproduction number (Rt). Other similar empirical studies treat the measures as binary variables,
do not address the potential confounding effect of increased caseload on transmission, and do not use
Rt as the primary metric.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results support the findings in modelling studies, and subsequent empirical studies, that physical
distancing measures can limit disease spread. We found that full border control and complete
lockdowns are effective, but less stringent measures such as stay-at-home recommendations and
working from home are as effective. As such, the framing of lockdown measures as a binary approach
may be counterproductive. Overall, these measures are only effective if they are implemented early.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in early December
2019 in Wuhan, China. As of May 31, 2020, it has affected 5.93 million people and resulted in more than
367,000 deaths globally (WHO 2020).
In the absence of effective therapeutics or vaccines, containment measures rely on the capacity to
control viral transmission through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (Kissler et al. 2020). Current
evidence suggests that the effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing strategies can be
enhanced when combined with physical distancing measures in public settings (Chu et al. 2020;
Kucharski et al. 2020). Governments worldwide have implemented various forms of physical distancing
measure with varied stringency level and timeliness. The measures include school and workplace
closures, cancellation of public events, restrictions on mass gatherings, public transport closures, stayat-home orders, restrictions on internal movements, and international travel controls. Due to the
potential for socioeconomic disruptions caused by these measures, it is therefore important to quantify
their impact on disease spread to inform policymaking, which has thus far relied primarily on epidemic
modelling studies (Ferguson et al. 2020; Prem et al. 2020). As cases accumulate, it has become possible
to use empirical data derived from real-world observations to validate the model-based estimates of the
effectiveness of policy interventions.
In this paper, we assessed—at a normalized point on the epidemic curve—the impact of physical
distancing measures on viral transmission measured by the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, which
represents the expected number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at time t. A value of Rt
greater than one indicates that a sustained outbreak is likely. The goal of policy intervention is to bring
Rt below one, suggesting that the outbreak is under control.

Methods
Physical distancing measures
Data on physical distancing measures were obtained from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
Tracker (OxCGRT), which collects information, starting from January 1, 2020, on a range of government
policies, assigns a stringency score for the measures, and aggregates the data into a common index for
170 countries (May 28 version). We used the Stringency Index as an aggregate measure, which has a
score between 0 and 100, with a higher index indicating increased stringency. We further examined the
impact of specific measures: (i) school closures; (ii) workplace closures; (iii) cancellation of public events;
(iv) restrictions on size of gatherings; (v) public transport closures; (vi) stay-at-home orders; (vii)
restrictions on internal movements, and (viii) restrictions on international travel. These measures have
an ordinal scale of severity or intensity. Further details on the OxCGRT database are provided in Hale et
al. (2020).
Estimation of the real-time reproduction number

We normalized the stage of disease spread to minimize the confounding effect of increased caseload on
transmission: the impact of interventions is expected to be different at 10 and 1,000 cases. We used 100
total cases as the starting point for all countries to indicate an outbreak (Hartfield and Alizon 2013).
We estimated Rt for 142 countries that have reported at least 100 cases as of May 28, 2020. The
estimation covered the whole period from the first reported case to May 28 using a weekly sliding
window based on the methods developed by Cori et al. (2013). We used data on new daily cases and the
distribution of the generation time (time between infection of an index case and infection of a
secondary case). We incorporated uncertainty in the generation time distribution with a mean of 3.6
days (sd: 0.7 days) and standard deviation of 3 days (sd: 0.8 days) and used a Gamma prior for the
reproduction number with mean 2.6 and standard deviation 2. These parameter estimates were
obtained from the COVID-19 Epiforecasts project by the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of
Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (see Abbott et al. 2020). Data
on daily reported cases were obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
and from the Johns Hopkins University Centre for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 Data
Depository. Rt was estimated using the EpiEstim package in R version 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).
An important feature of examining Rt, instead of cumulative case numbers, is that, if the proportion of
cases that are unreported remain constant throughout an outbreak, estimates of Rt are unaffected by
underreporting (Thompson et al. 2019).
Regression model
As countries have implemented and subsequently relaxed measures in response to the outbreak,
establishing causality from such measures to a change in Rt is challenging. To address possible reverse
causality, we examined the measures that were in place at the time when 100 cases have been
reported. We then tracked Rt temporally over the next 14 days. The lagged measures thus controls for
the endogenous response to viral transmission.
We regressed Rt on physical distancing measures and other covariates. The control variables used were
income level (log of GDP per capita at current US$), population density (log of population per square
kilometre), age structure (proportion of population aged 65 years and above), and air temperature (14day average after the 100th case). These socioeconomic and environmental factors have been postulated
to influence disease spread (Liu et al. 2020; Qiu et al. 2020). Data on GDP per capita, population density,
and population above 65 years old were obtained from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators, supplemented by the Central Intelligence Agency’s The World Factbook. Data on
temperature were collected from the Air Quality Open Data Platform and other online weather
resources.

temperature) of country ; is a constant term, ’s are the regression coefficients, and denotes the
error term.
We also conducted ex-post predictions on the date of the 100th case using equation (1) to make
comparative assessments on how Rt would be predicted to evolve relative to what has been observed in
reality. All regression analyses were performed in Stata 14 (StataCorp LLC).
Robustness checks
We conducted a series of robustness checks to validate our results. We explored a shorter time horizon
of seven days to address the possibility of new measures implemented after the 100th case that could
affect Rt. We also used the growth in total cases instead of Rt as the dependent variable. To examine
actual behavioural changes instead of de jure government policies, we used a de facto measure of
physical distancing using mobility data from Google Community Mobility Reports.

Results
We first take a cursory look at the nature of the relationship between physical distancing measures and
Rt, and then proceed to estimate the magnitudes using regression models.
Figure 1 shows how Rt (average over the 14 days following the 100th case) varies with the stringency of
physical distancing measures (as of date of 100th case). There are several important observations: (i)
countries with more stringent measures tend to have lower Rt on average, as illustrated by the
downward sloping line; (ii) no country with a stringency index lower than 50 could bring average Rt to
below one within two weeks; and (iii) countries with Rt less than 1.5 on the date of the 100th case have
generally kept total cases (size of the bubbles) at a manageable level (as of May 28).

The time-varying reproduction number Rt is the expected number of secondary cases generated by a primary case
at time t. The Stringency Index is a composite index of physical distancing measures with a range of 0 to 100,
calculated by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT); a larger value indicates higher
stringency. Each bubble represents a country, and the size of the bubble is proportional to the total number of
reported cases as of May 28, 2020. The red solid line is the best linear fit of the relationship between the
th
stringency level on the date of the 100 reported case and the average Rt in the following two weeks. The green
dashed line is the Rt threshold: a value below one indicates that a sustained outbreak is unlikely if the measures
remain in place.

The average timing of implementation of the physical distancing measures is summarized in Table S1 in
the Supplementary materials. The earliest policies to be implemented, on average, were restrictions on
international travel, about 11 days before the detection of the first case. Cancellation of public events
and school closures were the initial responses during the onset of an outbreak (about a week after the
first case), followed by restrictions on the size of gatherings and more stringent measures such as
workplace closures, restrictions on internal movement, stay-at-home orders, and public transport
closures. On average, all these measures were implemented before the occurrence of the 100th case.
Since several measures were implemented very close to one another, and due to the similar nature of
some the measures, it is difficult to relate the observed changes in Rt to a specific measure. We

addressed this identification issue by grouping the measures, taking into account the implementation
timing and correlation (Table S2 in Supplementary materials). We identified three distinct categories of
physical distancing measures amenable to our analysis: (i) restrictions on international travel; (ii)
restrictions on mass gatherings; and (iii) lockdown-type measures. Within each category, the intensity
and timeliness of implementation varies (Table 1). In particular, we highlight the wide range of measures
within a category. For instance, in lockdown-type measures, the least stringent being recommendations
and government advisories on internal movement, up to complete lockdown with closure of all nonessential workplaces and stay-at-home requirements with minimal exceptions.
Restrictions on international travel are based on OxCGRT indicator C8. Restrictions on mass gatherings
combine OxCGRT indicators C3 (cancel public events) and C4 (size restriction of gatherings). Lockdown
combines OxCGRT indicators C2 (workplace closures), C6 (stay-at-home requirements), and C7
(restrictions on internal movement). A measure is considered to be implemented early if the number of
days between implementation date and date of 100th case is less than the global median, and late
otherwise. For instance, Taiwan acted swiftly in banning arrivals for some regions (56 days before 100th
reported case, compared to global median of 31 days before 100th case) while Sweden was late to
implement border controls (12 days after 100th case).

Authors’ definitions using data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). A measure is
th
considered to be “early” if the number of days between implementation date and date of 100 case is less than
the median, and “late” otherwise.

Figures 2 to 4 show how Rt varies with each physical distancing measure. In general, the more stringent
the measure and the earlier its implementation, the lower the value of Rt. In the case of international
travel restrictions, Rt below one was only observed in countries that either implemented quarantine of
arriving passengers from high-risk regions early, or enacted bans on arrivals. On mass gathering
restrictions, Rt less than one was observed in countries that either cancelled public events or limited the
size of gatherings. Interestingly, one country (Brunei) managed to bring Rt to below one without the
need for any form of lockdown-type measures. Overall, countries with earlier and more stringent
measures at the time of the 100th case appeared to have recorded far fewer cases (as of May 28),
although there are a few exceptions (e.g. Peru and Russia, despite early lockdowns).

Impact of physical distancing measures
We first examine the impact of the Stringency Index on Rt. The results are reported in column (1) of
Table 2. The estimated coefficient of the Stringency Index is negative and significant: an increase in the
index by 10 points reduces Rt by 0.06 (95% CI: -0.08, -0.04). Among the other independent variables,
warmer temperature is associated with a lower Rt: an increase in the temperature of 10 degree Celsius
reduces Rt by 0.16 (95% CI: -0.24, -0.09).

is a composite index of physical distancing measures with a range of 0 to 100, calculated by the Oxford COVID-19
Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). Mobility (from Google Community Mobility Reports) is the average
percent change in visits to retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit and workplaces on the date
th
of the 100 case compared to the median baseline value of the corresponding day of the week during January 3 to
February 6, 2020, as a proxy measurement of de facto physical distancing; a positive coefficient indicates that a
reduction in mobility reduces Rt,14.
Standard errors are in parenthesis. ***, **, and * represents statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level
respectively.

We then assess the impact of the three categories of physical distancing measures individually, and then
collectively. Table 3 reports the results. Columns (1) to (3) affirm the observations from Figures 2 to 4
that earlier and more stringent measures were associated with lower Rt. However, some of the
significant results disappeared when all the variables were entered simultaneously.
Column (4) shows that travel bans on all regions and lockdown-type measures, if implemented early,
significantly lowered Rt. Relative to no measures being taken, a total border closure reduces Rt by 0.24
(95% CI: -0.50, 0.01); policies that recommend working from home or staying home reduce Rt by 0.45
(95% CI: -0.82, -0.07); a partial lockdown reduces Rt by 0.38 (95% CI: -0.72, -0.04); and a complete
lockdown reduces Rt by 0.32 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.09).

The dependent variable is the average Rt over the 14 days since the date of the 100 case. Rt, the timevarying reproduction number, is the expected number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at time t.
The physical distancing measures are those that are in place on the date of the 100th case; refer to Table 1
for the specific measures. Standard errors are in parenthesis. ***, **, and * represents statistical significance at
the 1%, 5%, and 10% level respectively. N/A denotes not available.

To validate our results, we conducted several robustness checks. We tracked Rt over seven days and
used the growth of total cases instead of Rt as the dependent variable. We also used a de facto
measurement of physical distancing using Google mobility data—as opposed to de jure government
announced measures—to examine the actual observed behaviour changes on Rt. The findings are largely
unchanged, as reported in columns (2) to (4) in Table 2 and the Supplementary materials (Tables S3 and
S4, Figure S1).
Ex-post predictions
We conducted ex-post predictions using the regression model in column (4) of Table 3 to retrospectively
assess how Rt would be predicted to evolve over the following two weeks, given the case history and
physical distancing measures implemented on the date of the 100th case, along with specific country
characteristics. The predicted Rt of the 142 countries are displayed in Table S5 in the Supplementary
materials. Some countries had a lower Rt over the two weeks following the 100th case than predicted by
the model, such as Japan, Brunei, Iceland, and Vietnam. By contrast, others, such as Turkey, Italy, and
the United States had a higher Rt.

Discussion
We assessed, at a standardized stage of the outbreak at 100 cases, the impact of physical distancing
measures on COVID-19 transmission, measured by Rt, and found that, on average, they have been
effective in reducing Rt—if the measures were sufficiently stringent and implemented early. By using Rt
as the primary metric of transmission, instead of cumulative case counts in other similar studies (Castex

et al. 2020; Deb et al. 2020), we accounted for potential confounding effects caused by under-testing
and underreporting of cases.
Our study provides empirical support to findings from modelling studies that highlight the role of
physical distancing measures in containing COVID-19. We identified three distinct measures,
implemented at different times—restrictions on international travel prior to the first reported case,
restrictions on mass gatherings during the onset of an outbreak, and lockdowns at later stages.
Our analysis suggests a hierarchy of physical distancing measures that are effective in outbreak control.
We found that lockdown-type measures had the largest effect on limiting viral transmission, followed by
complete travel bans. These measures have to be implemented early to be effective—based on our
definition of early implementation using the observed median timing across countries worldwide,
lockdown measures should be instituted two weeks before the 100th case and travel bans about a week
before detection of the first case.
This accords with the findings in other studies that severe travel restrictions have been critical in slowing
down infections in China (Kucharski et al. 2020) and around the world (Keita 2020), and also
corroborates studies showing that lockdowns limited disease spread in Wuhan (Fang et al. 2020), Italy
and Spain (Tobias 2020), and California (Friedson et al. 2020).
Importantly, our findings suggest that lockdowns measures should not be viewed in a binary approach.
There is a wide range of lockdown-type measures from less stringent forms such as working from home
up to complete movement restrictions, and all were shown to be effective in suppressing viral
transmission. If implemented early, work from home and stay at home recommendations reduce Rt by
0.45 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.07); a partial lockdown reduces Rt by 0.38 (95% CI: -0.72, -0.04); and a complete
lockdown reduces Rt by 0.32 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.09). Across these three grades of lockdown-type
measures, the 95% CI of their effect sizes overlap suggesting no significant difference in effectiveness
across these measures. This finding is replicated even when assessed against other indicators of
outbreak control, such as the increase in cumulative cases. As such, we suggest that early on in the
outbreak, complete lockdowns may be unnecessary to control viral transmission, given the availability of
other equally effective and more sustainable approaches. This is particularly important for the poorest
countries. More than four-fifths of low- and lower-middle income countries have imposed complete
lockdowns at the time of 100 reported cases (compared to three-fifths in upper-middle income and less
than one-third in high-income countries), with potentially severe socioeconomic consequences, having
already been hit by the slump in global economic activity, including sharp declines in remittances,
tourism receipts, and commodity revenues (World Bank 2020).
Measures that recommend workplace closures or staying at home have been effective, implying that
voluntary physical distancing has played an important role. In the United States, the decrease in mobility
has been found to be largely voluntary, reflecting greater awareness of risk (Maloney and Taskin 2020).
Japan has achieved success without the need for a complete lockdown. Clear public health messaging
and voluntary practice of physical distancing shaped by cultural norms such as mask wearing, avoiding
handshakes, and keeping silence when taking public transport and during events such as funerals, have
been critical in limiting disease spread (Sposato 2020).
Overall, our analysis suggests that a combination of physical distancing measures may yield the most
beneficial outcomes: international travel restrictions to limit imported cases from high-risk regions,

encouraging voluntary social distancing, moderate forms of lockdown-type measures such as working
from home and only leaving the house for necessary activities, and complete lockdowns in areas or
provinces with more severe outbreaks. The implementation timeliness of these measures invariably
depends on the country-specific context, including public acceptance and institutional capacity.
Countries that have been relatively successful share these common elements. Despite an international
travel hub and its close proximity to Wuhan, early border control and the practice of personal protective
behaviours, including the use of face masks, contributed to Hong Kong’s success in controlling viral
transmission (Wong et al. 2020). Taiwan and Brunei responded quickly by instituting border control and
reassured the public by delivering timely information on the epidemic (Wang et al. 2020; Wong et al.
2020). Targeted lockdown-type measures in Vietnam, coupled with mask wearing and consistent public
health messaging, helped to contain disease spread (Duc Huynh 2020).
Our study has several limitations. First, although we controlled for several country characteristics, our
model could suffer from omitted variable bias as behavioural variables, such as mask wearing, were
unaccounted for due to lack of data. Second, beyond physical distancing measures, other NPIs such as
early case isolation and aggressive contact tracing and quarantine are critical elements of a successful
containment strategy (Ferguson et al. 2020), which we could not control for, again due to the lack of
data. Third, although a significant amount of effort has been put into the construction of the OxCGRT
database with a global coverage and a systematic classification of government policies, there could be
some reporting errors or data quality issues. Moreover, our country-level analysis may miss the variation
of policies implemented at the city/county/province level. Nonetheless, the database is the most
comprehensive to date.
Conclusion
Physical distancing measures have been applied in arguably every country that is fighting COVID-19.
Although modelling studies have shown the importance of physical distancing in stemming disease
spread, few empirical studies have validated this finding. We provide empirical support and quantified
the impact of physical distancing measures in lowering the reproduction number, particularly lockdowntype measures and border closures. Moreover, we found that less stringent lockdown-type measures,
such as encouraging working from home and staying home unless necessary were as effective as
complete lockdowns in reducing transmission. However, all these measures have to be implemented
early to be effective. As many countries are in the midst of de-escalating, we suggest that some
combination of these measures—empirically justified—should be considered in containing subsequent
waves of COVID-19.

The dependent variable is the average Rt over the 7 days since the date of the 100 case. Rt, the time-varying
reproduction number, is the expected number of secondary cases generated by a primary case at time t. The
physical distancing measures are those that are in place on the date of the 100th case; refer to Table 1 for
the specific measures. Standard errors are in parenthesis. ***, **, and * represents statistical significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level respectively. N/A denotes not available.

SI is the Stringency Index, a composite index of physical distancing measures with a range of 0 to 100, calculated by
the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT); a larger value indicates higher stringency. TR refers
to restrictions on international travel, MG refers to restrictions on mass gatherings, and LD refers to lockdown (see
Table 1 for the specific measures). Predicted Rt is the average predicted time-varying reproduction number over
th
the two weeks following the date of the 100 case, using a regression model. Estimated Rt is the estimated timevarying reproduction number using reported case data, averaged over the two weeks following the date of the
th
100 case.

The time-varying reproduction number Rt is the expected number of secondary cases generated by a primary case
at time t. The change in mobility (average of retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit and
workplaces) is relative to the baseline median value of the corresponding day of the week during January 3 to
February 6, 2020; data for 103 countries from Google Community Mobility Trends Reports. Each bubble represents
a country, and the size of the bubble is proportional to the total number of reported cases as of May 28, 2020. The
th
red solid line is the best linear fit of the relationship between the stringency level on the date of the 100 reported
case and the average Rt in the following two weeks. The green dashed line is the R t threshold: a value below one
indicates that a sustained outbreak is unlikely if the measures remain in place.
