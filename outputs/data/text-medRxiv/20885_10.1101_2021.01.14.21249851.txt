SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, transmission, health-related
outcomes and control strategies in homeless shelters:
systematic review and meta-analysis
Amir Mohsenpour, Kayvan Bozorgmehr, Sven Rohleder, Jan Stratil, Diogo Costa

Summary
Background People experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at particular risk for
COVID19. We synthesised the evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission,
outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the
effectiveness of targeted strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC).
Methods Systematic review of articles, reports and grey-literature indexed in
electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO-Covid19, Web of Science), pre-print
repositories, institutional websites, and handsearching. Empirical papers of any
study design addressing Covid-19 in PEH or homeless shelters’ staff in English were
included. (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020187033)
Findings Of 194 publications, 13 studies were included (two modelling, ten
observational and one qualitative study). All were conducted in high-income
countries. Random-effect meta-analysis of prevalence estimates yields a baseline
SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2·14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1·02-3·27)
in PEH and 1·72 % (95%CI=0·31-3·12) in staff. In outbreaks, the pooled prevalence
increases to 29·49% (95%CI=16·44-29·55) in PEH and 15·18% (95%CI=8·9521·42) in staff. Main IPC strategies were universal and rapid testing, expansion of
non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters (bed spacing,
limited staff rotation).
Interpretation Up to 30% PEH and 17% staff are infected during outbreaks of
SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters. Most studies were conducted in the USA. No
studies were found on health-related outcomes or health effects of NPI. An overview
and evaluation of IPC strategies for PEH, including a better understanding of disease
transmission, and reliable data on PEH within Covid-19 notification systems is
needed. Qualitative studies may serve to voice PEH experiences and guide future

Panel 1: Research in context
Evidence before this study
People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at increased risk of infectious, chronic, and mental
health adverse conditions. Due to the risk of transmission in shared accommodations, PEH may
be particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken to mitigate the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak may have
further aggravated health and social conditions. However, there is no evidence synthesis on the
SARS-Cov-2 epidemiology among PEH, the correspondent clinical and other health-related
outcomes as well as health effects of NPIs on these groups.
Added value of this study We reviewed and synthesized existent evidence on the risk of infection
and transmission, risk of severe course of disease, effect of NPIs on health outcomes and the
effectiveness of implemented measures to avert risks and negative outcomes among PEH. Results
of the identified studies suggest that both PEH and shelter staff are at high risk of SARS-Cov-2
infection, especially in case of a local outbreak. Due to the low prevalence of symptoms at the
time of a positive SARS-Cov-2 test among PEH, symptom screening alone may not be efficient
to control outbreaks. Instead, universal and rapid testing conjugated with expansion of noncongregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters, are discussed as sensible
strategies.
Implications of all the available evidence A comprehensive overview of NPIs and shelter
strategies targeting PEH and evaluation of their effectiveness and unintended health consequences
is needed. Qualitative research considering living realities of PEH can facilitate understanding of
their specific needs during the pandemic.

Introduction
Homelessness is associated with mental health problems1,2, infectious diseases3,
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and several long-term conditions (e.g., asthma,
COPD, epilepsy)4. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are a diverse group
categorized according to their living situation: (a) Rooflessness, people without shelter
sleeping rough in the streets or in public spaces, (b) houselessness, with accommodation
of temporary nature, (c) living in insecure housing, shaped by threats of insecure tenancy,
eviction or domestic violence, and (d) living in inadequate housing, e.g. in caravans on
illegal campsites or in extreme overcrowding5,6.
The policy measures taken to mitigate the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, such as
physical distancing and national lockdowns, may have aggravated their health and social
conditions, adding to their already marginalised situation7–9 .
Typical means of survival in daily life of PEH were disrupted, e.g. food banks and other
basic aid facilities were shut-down, temporary housing projects were halted8. It is unclear
how PEH dealt with the generalised closure of institutions, restrictions in movements and
public transports, or how they perceived and adhered to the measures imposed, such as
the use of nose and mouth protection.
PEH are vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection due to the risk of transmission in shared
accommodations, comorbidities and lower immune-response because of poor nutrition
and food insecurity. Yet, evidence is scarce about the risk of infection among PEH, their
differential susceptibility and health outcomes observed during the pandemic, to inform
the design of infection protection and control (IPC) strategies.
We aimed to synthesize the evidence on the risk of infection and transmission, risk of
severe course of disease, effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on health
outcomes and IPC strategies to avert risks and negative outcomes among PEH.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO(PROSPERO registration 2020
CRD42020187033)10. The recommendations by the taskforce on guidelines for
systematic reviews in health promotion and public health11 were followed. A systematic
search of scientific databases was conducted in EMBASE, the WHO Covid19 database,
and Web of Science Core Collection. The research questions are presented in Box 1. The
search strategy details are presented in supplementary material 1.
Panel 2: research questions
The systematic review was guided by five specific research questions:

1. What is the prevalence or incidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in homeless shelters?
2. What is the evidence on transmission among PEH in different settings (e. g. in homeless shelters, at
outreach events, when sleeping rough on the street)?
3. What are clinical and other health-related outcomes of the disease among PEH (e. g. measured by
hospitalisation, ICU, ventilation, mortality)?
4. What is the evidence on the effects of lockdown measures and other non-pharmacological
interventions on the health status of PEH?
5. What is the evidence on the effects of policies/strategies specifically enacted for PEH?

To cover unpublished research results, we searched pre-print repositories (medRxiv,
bioRxiv), websites of 6 relevant institutions (see supplementary material 1) and the live
map of COVID-19 evidence by the Norwegian Institute for Public Health.
A PICO framework was used to help define the inclusion/exclusion criteria: population
was defined as PEH fitting the FEANTSA-ETHOS definitions; empirical quantitative,
qualitative and mixed-methods studies, documenting exposure to SARS-Cov-2 or any
policy measure or specific IPC strategies for PEH during the Pandemic were included;
the general population was considered the standard for comparison, although a
comparison group was not a criteria for inclusion; outcomes could be any health-related
effect of SARS-Cov-2, including prevalence, incidence, evidence on transmission,
development of disease, risk of severe course of disease, hospitalisation, ICU utilization,
ventilation, mortality, etc. Effects of lockdown and other NPIs on the health status of PEH
were also considered.
Empirical studies in English, indexed from December 1st 2019 onwards, were included,
and the searches were conducted on June 5th and 9th 2020. The table of contents of 4

relevant journals were also searched (Clinical Infectious Diseases, European Journal of
Homelessness, The Lancet, Lancet Psychiatry).
Data analysis
Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent researchers applying pre-defined
inclusion/exclusion criteria. After screening 20%, the review team refined the criteria for
the remaining articles. Full texts were obtained for all included studies and for those
where no agreement could be established based on title/abstracts alone. For all included
full text articles, backward and forward citation search was conducted (PRISMA
Flowchart figure 1).
We extracted relevant parameters from cross-sectional quantitative studies to synthesise
a pooled measure of SARS-Cov-2 prevalence.
The extracted data was stratified based on the presence of an outbreak situation during
data collection, either marked as such by authors or based on a prevalence of >=5%. Risk
of bias and publication bias were assessed through funnel plots and regression-based
statistical testing by Egger 12,13.
Stata V1614 with commands metaprop15 and meta16 were used in analysis.

Results
After duplicates removal, 194 title and abstracts were eligible for screening. Twelve
studies were included for full-text screening and ten eventually included in analysis. The
screening of table of contents of specific journals, retrieved three additional studies.
Information was thus extracted from ten cross-sectional quantitative studies, two studies
modelling various indicators and one qualitative study exploring experiences of women
in unstable housing and previous criminal justice involvement during the pandemic
(PRISMA Flowchart figure 1)17.
Eight of the cross-sectional quantitative studies were conducted in the USA18–25, one in
Canada26 and one in France27. All studies collected data from March to early May 2020
during the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, except one20, conducted from April
to August 2020.
All studies focused on people experiencing houselessness (i.e. with a place to sleep but
temporary in institutions or shelter according to FEANTSA-ETHOS definitions5,6) with
one study21 additionally testing people experiencing rooflessness. Nine articles reported
PCR-based estimates of SARS-Cov-2 prevalence (with some offering additional data on
other health or living conditions of homeless people), while one study24 researched shelter
tenants’ knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and their adherence to behavioural
rules. A total of six articles reported prevalence estimates for staff working at the
homeless facilities18,21–23,26,27. Studies’ characteristics are presented in Table 1

Prevalence of SARS-Cov2 in homeless shelters
We found 9 quantitative articles reporting PCR-based SARS-Cov-2 prevalence estimates
in PEH and 6 studies reporting prevalence estimates for shelter staff members. To adjust
for the varying settings and contexts, we pooled the measures in a random-effects metaanalysis model for PEH (n=7107) and staff (n=1375). To consider the difference in nature
of investigating an outbreak18,19,22,23,25,27 and testing for baseline estimation18,20,21,26,27 in
our meta-analysis, we sub-pooled the measures accordingly.
For PEH, the pooled SARS-Cov-2 prevalence estimate was 29·49% (95% Confidence
Interval, 95%CI=16·44%-42·55%, I2=97·79%, p=0·00) in the context of outbreak
situations. As a sensitivity analysis, we removed an outlier that could reflect a superspreading event (Imbert et al.,22 67·33%, 95%CI=59·48%-74·32%), resulting in a pooled
prevalence of 23·32% (95%CI=12·12%-34·53%, I2=96·79%, p=0·00). For baseline
estimation, the pooled prevalence was 2·14% (95%CI=1·02%-3·27%, I2=83·80%,
p=0·00) (figure 2).
For staff members, the random-effect meta-analysis resulted in a pooled prevalence of
15·18% (95%CI=8·95%-21·42%, I2=65·76%, p=0·02) during an outbreak situation and
1·72% (95%CI=0·31%-3·12%)) for baseline estimation (figure 3).

Transmission among PEH
While all studies tested PEH in homeless shelters, one study by Yoon et al.21 conducted
additional testing of clients living unsheltered during homeless outreach service events
(e.g. meal services). This resulted in a prevalence of 0·5% (3 out of 636) in the unsheltered
PEH.
Clinical and health-related outcomes among PEH,
Five articles19,21,24,25,27 presented data on clinical outcomes of PEH, ranging from
respiratory symptoms to previous mental health diagnosis and other somatic issues (e.g.
chronic kidney or liver disease), and one article22 provided data on emergency department
visits, hospitalization and mortality. Four articles19,21,22,25 provided data specifically for
PEH testing positive: specific symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fever) were either
uncommon or did not differ significantly from the overall tested population of PEH.
Neither did comorbidities25. Imbert et al.22 used a city-wide administrative database and
reported 12% (n=12) of those tested positive to have had a treatment and release
emergency department visit, 8% (n=8) a hospitalization and 1% (n=1) died.
Comparing to RT-PCR, Yoon et al. calculated sensitivity and specificity of symptom
screening, stating that fever, cough, or shortness of breath was 14% sensitive and 89%
specific for identifying COVID-19 cases when reported in the previous day, changing to
24% and 85% when reported in the previous week. An expansion to any symptom
reported resulted in no improvement of sensitivity, but a loss in specificity (last week:
81%; last day: 87%).
Two studies modelled different health-related outcomes among PEH with one modelling
conducted for England28 and one for the USA29.
Lewer et al. (2020)28 aimed to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the population of
PEH of England and estimate the reduction in mortality and healthcare use that could
result from a targeted intervention compared with a “do nothing” scenario.The authors
used a Markov chain model with a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered
(SEIR) model, assuming a basic reproductive rate of 1·4 in the baseline scenario, a
latency, incubation and infectiousness period of 2·5 days, 5 days, and 6·5 days
respectively, and infection fatality ratio for patients of 4.8% for those homeless defined
as vulnerable (37%) and 0·6% for the remaining population. For the latter scenario, the
authors estimated that 15448 cases of COVID-19 could occur among the 35817 homeless
and 10748 people sleeping rough in England, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 34%.

This incidence could be reduced to 21% (i.e. 9934 cases) with a targeted intervention by
the housing and health authorities in England. The authors also estimated a total of 364
death if nothing was implemented for PEH in England but a reduction to 200 deaths with
the intervention.
The report by Culhane et al (2020)29 aimed to estimate the mortality, hospitalisation costs
and system capacity to manage the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the existing
population of PEH in the USA. Based on data on the age distribution of PEH from two
large cities (Los Angeles and New York) and on studies that older homeless populations
bear health risks comparable to those of individuals 15-20 years old, the authors estimated
that there were 4·3% PEH across the USA (corresponding to 21295 people, ranging from
2·4% to 10·3%) that could require hospitalization assuming an infection rate reaching
40%. They also estimated that critical care needs could range from 0·6% to 4·2% for the
homeless and fatality rates could range from 0·3% to 1·9% (central estimate 0·7% or
3454 deaths).
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)
We could not identify articles quantifying the effects of NPIs on PEH. However, one
qualitative study30 conducted unstructured interviews through telephone or social media
conversations with 35 participants from a US cohort study of criminal justice-involved
women to explore how they were faring during this period. Thirteen of the interviewees
reported some form of homelessness, and for some of the women their unstable living
situations prevented them from being able to follow the social distancing recommended.
Infection protection and control (IPC) strategies in homeless shelters
We identified no study quantifying the effectiveness of strategies for IPC among PEH.
Five papers23,25,26,28,29 discussed strategies for IPC more generally, and one study21
actively investigated these at 9 shelters. Yoon et al.21 describe different pandemic
preparation measures, e.g., 55·6% of shelters (5 in 9) discontinued taking in new clients,
77·8% (7 in 9) created separate isolation areas for PEH with suspected infection and
55·6% (5 in 9) increased the spacing between individual beds.
Across all studies, the major strategies discussed as important and necessary were
comprehensive and rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate supportive housing for
PEH and, specific strategies for IPC to be taken in congregate settings, e.g. increased
spacing between beds and/or limited staff rotation. O’Shea et al. further discussed

potential benefits in collaborating with regional laboratories for quick turnaround of test
results which enable the isolation of the infected.
Furthermore, Henwood et al24 reported that 39% (207 of 532) of the tenants of supportive
housing in Los Angeles considered themselves to be at serious risk for COVID-19 due to
a pre-existing condition, 59% (316 of 532) had a registered mental health diagnosis and
55·3% (294 of 532) believed they can shelter in place if needed.
Funnel plots of studies reporting SARS-Cov-2 prevalence and corresponding standard
errors are presented in figure 4. The Egger test suggests absence of significant publication
bias in all strata except for the overall prevalence of PEH, which disappears after
stratification by outbreak situation (supplementary material 3), supporting differentiation
between baseline estimation and outbreak investigation.
Risk of bias assessment is presented in table 2.

Discussion
In this systematic review including a total of 13 empirical studies, we identified a baseline
SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2·14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1·02-3·27%)
among PEH in homeless shelters, and 1·72% (95%CI=0·31-3·12%) among staff. In case
of an outbreak situation, these estimates increase to 29·49% (95%CI=16·44-29·55%)
among PEH and 15·18% (95%CI= 8·95-21·42%) among staff. Among unsheltered PEH,
one study reported a prevalence of 0·5%.
Regarding health-related outcomes, specific symptoms, e.g. cough, shortness of breath or
fever, were either uncommon or did not differ significantly from the overall tested
population of PEH19,21,22,24,25,27, neither did comorbidities25. One study reported 12%
treat-and-release emergency department visits, 8% hospitalization and 1% death among
those who tested positive, based on a city-wide administrative database22 without
specifying the time of follow-up. Further, one study determined reporting of fever, cough
or shortness of breath to have been 14-24% sensitive and 85-89% specific compared to
RT-PCR testing21.
Based on one qualitative study, unstable living situations were reported to be preventing
criminal-justice involved women from following social distancing practices
recommended.
Regarding IPC strategies, 6 studies21,23,25,26,28,29 discussed comprehensive and rapid
testing including collaboration with regional laboratories for quick turnaround of positive
tests, expansion of non-congregate housing and individual strategies in the shelters, e.g.
spacing between beds and limited staff rotation, as critical measures
The modelling studies reported potential SARS-Cov-2 infection among PEH of 21295
(4% of the general population) in the USA29 and 22933 (cumulative incidence of 49.3%
among PEH) in England28 during the first wave if no intervention measures had been
taken. Even if incidence of SARS-Cov-2 remains low in the general population, Lewer et
al28 conclude that an outbreak among PEH can lead up to 11566 infections if no
prevention measures are in place.
Although excluded from this review, we found several reports retrieved from the relevant
websites searched providing IPC strategies specifically for staff working in homeless
shelters (supplementary material 4). These strategies should be adapted to the respective
context and enacted to mitigate the spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection among this
vulnerable population group. We further identified important research gaps to be
addressed by future research (Panel 1)

Quality of Evidence
Studies providing prevalence estimates were based on PCR testing and some included
testing of staff for a complete picture of SARS-Cov-2 infection in shelters. Overall, the
quality of evidence was low. Most articles provide little detail on how and why shelters
were sampled. Studies may have missed infected patients who do not have enough viral
particles yet to be detected in PCR. Only two articles conducted follow-up testing21,23.
The recruitment of participants was based on accommodation in homeless shelters with
no systematic surveying of housing situation and residence type in shelter. This may be
of special importance considering the diverse background of PEH and their everyday life,
because not all shelters offer accommodation during the day. Finally, all identified studies
were based in high-income countries raising questions of generalizability especially to
middle- and lower-income countries that differ in population demographics, cultural and
social dimensions. Further details about the risk of bias are provided as supplementary
material 3.

Strengths and limitations
Besides major databases, we searched pre-print repositories and websites of relevant
institutions for unpublished manuscripts and consulted the Covid-19 evidence live map
of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Further, we have used forward and backward
reference screening on all identified articles and screened the TOCs of journals deemed
relevant for potential publications during the screening, extraction, and analysis phases.
All steps of the review have been conducted by two reviewers for quality assurance.
Finally, we tested for publication bias, both visually through funnel plotting as well as
statistically based on Egger12,13. Additionally, danger of publication bias might be low as
we are investigating prevalence (compared to measures of effect) during the onset of a
pandemic of global relevance.
We have used English search terms only, thus might have missed relevant studies in other
languages. This could explain why only one study from a non-English language country
was identified. Our findings may not be generalizable to other settings than the ones
where the studies were conducted, as droplet or potentially airborne transmission may be
different in other contexts of social and cultural communication and interaction. Third,
even though we searched several databases and repositories, we might not have detected
all relevant studies considering the amount of evidence being generated during the current
pandemic. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of publication bias, particularly
regarding the baseline prevalence among staff since estimates for staff were not part of
these studies’ initial objectives.
Conclusions
As the quality of included studies varies, findings should be considered with caution. Yet,
they clearly suggest that PEH are at high risk of being infected with SARS-Cov-2,
especially in case of outbreaks in shelters. Potential pathways for transmissions deserving
further investigation are the “mobile nature of the community and use of multiple
homeless service sites among residents”23, crowded sleeping arrangements and
difficulties in adhering to recommended behavioural interventions due to lack of
resources and private space. Furthermore, PEH face serious mental health challenges24
and economic difficulties that prevent them from accessing preventive material and
maintaining physical distancing in general30.
The nature and direction of the infectious disease spread is unclear but staff working at

of IPC in congregate shelters and the expansion of provision of non-congregate housing
for PEH.
Due to the absence or low prevalence of symptoms (e.g. fever) at the time of diagnosis of
SARS-Cov-2 among PEH19,21,25,27, symptom screening alone is not suitable, i.e. not
sensitive enough for adequately capturing the extent of disease transmission in such highrisk settings. Instead, comprehensive and early testing for timely identification and
isolation of the infected, combined with collaboration with regional laboratories for quick
turnaround of positive test results might be important strategies to break the virus
transmission21,26.

Panel 3: Research gaps identified
(A) Lack of data for evaluation of NPIs effectiveness and (un)intended health consequences
(1) lack of reliable and separate

(2) lack of a comprehensive

(3) lack of understanding of

data on PEH within Covid-19

overview of NPIs and shelter

infectious disease spread among

notification systems

strategies targeting PEH

PEH, e.g. in homeless shelters

(B) Targeted research into people experiencing rooflessness
While PEH may be deemed as a hard-to-reach population in general, it is essential to differentiate those
living in shelters from those sleeping rough. People experiencing rooflessness may be at a less risk of
SARS-Cov-2 infection as long as they do not seek congregate shelter but at the same time, they may be
the ones experiencing more heavily the challenges of social distancing to mental and social wellbeing
associated with the imposed lockdowns.

(C) Lack of qualitative research into living realities of PEH
More qualitative research is needed to better understand living realities and particular needs of PEH
during the pandemic. This can further kick-start the participation of PEH in the research process and
increase
(D) Timely updates of the review
With the current infection dynamics and speed of research, timely updates of synthesised information is
essential.

Study population was not
randomly and homogeneously

At the time of study, many
shelter residents who had
tested positive were already
housed in a hotel, which likely
led to an underestimate of true

population; Testing done at the
shelters
with
transient
residents only reflects those
staying there on the night of
testing, and not intermittent
users.

3 – Risk of bias assessment
We conducted a separate risk of bias assessment for all included articles. Summarizing the quantitative
cross-sectional studies, all articles had a clear population by study design as a majority were conducted in
homeless shelters, stated clear research objectives and, if reporting on prevalence, used PCR testing. Yet,
few studies explicitly stated if data collection was conducted during a suspected outbreak situation or with
the aim to provide baseline estimates and only 2 studies engaged in follow-up testing, one after 1 week1
and one after 3-4 weeks2 to investigate the full extent of a potential outbreak. As expected from studies
conducted at an early stage of the pandemic, the majority of results are descriptive in nature.
The qualitative article3 offered a first insight into conversations with criminal justice-involved women yet
offered little details on study design (including questions on how conversations were guided), details on
interviewers and implications for the way interviews progress as well as ethical concerns. Further, the
article does not provide information to check quality criteria in qualitative research (e. g. intersubjectivity),
nor explores the interview findings in detail.
The two modelling studies offered insights into their assumptions and results, although the included greyliterature report4 lacks several details about assumptions taken. It further uses data from registers from two
cities (Los Angeles and New York) to extrapolate the age range of homeless groups (aged 25+) for all US
regions. The overall size of the homeless population is based on a “point-in-time” estimate, and the
assumption of a 40% infection rate is based on existent literature (not necessarily from the US). The authors
state using “nonlinear regression techniques” for their estimation, although a concrete model is not
specified.
The modelling approach taken by Lewer et al.,5 describes all assumptions taken and provides concrete
information of studies and conditions where initial assumptions were extrapolated from (e. g. using
demographic profile of a homeless charity in London, based on census of providers of accommodations
conducted during 2019, an official count of people sleeping rough, data from a multi-agency database for
people sleeping rough, and data from night shelters in London). Furthermore, all the details from the actual
modelling conducted (with respective syntax) are provided as additional material accessible with the
publication in open access repository.
