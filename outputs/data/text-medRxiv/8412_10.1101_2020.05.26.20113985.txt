Abstract
Objectives: This work aimed at modeling the progressions of COVID-19 cases in time in
relation to meteorological factors in large cities of Brazil, Italy, Spain, and USA, and finding the
viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus in different weather conditions based on models.
Methods: New models constructed showing the relationship of the I 0 (the number of infected
individuals divided by the total population of a city) with the independent variables -time, temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity. The regression models fitting in the data were
statistically validated by : 1) plot of observed and predicted response; 2) standardized residual
plots showing the characteristics of errors; 3) adjusted R̄2 value; 4) the p value for the parameters
associated with the various independent variables; and 5) the predictive power of the model beyond
data points.
Results: Models indicate that 1) the transmission of COVID-19 could be relatively high either for elevated temperatures with lower relative humidity or for lower temperatures with higher
relative humidity conditions; 2) disease transmission is expected to be reduced more with higher
wind velocity; 3) the rate of increase in the number of COVID-19 cases increases in one model
with a constant rate and in the other two with varying rates in time. These transmission features
seem to have connections with the structural components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Under suitable meteorological conditions, the partial natural disappearance of COVID-19 pandemic could be
possible.
Conclusion: New models for I 0 may be considered to understand the viability of the virus in
the environment and future transmission of COVID-19.

1. Introduction
The highly pathogenic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic after
its initial outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, during December, 2019. According to
the recent report of the World Health Organization, the disease has spread to six continents
and 210 countries and as on 10 August 2020, there have been 19,687,156 confirmed cases of
COVID-19, including 727,435 deaths (WHO, 2020). The causative organism for COVID-19
is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a genus belonging to
family Coronaviridae. Clinically, patients with COVID-19 develop respiratory symptoms,
which is very similar to other respiratory virus infections. Multiple symptoms may be
involved with COVID-19, including respiratory (cough, shortness of breath, sore throat,
rhinorrhea, hemoptysis, and chest pain), gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting),
musculoskeletal (muscle ache), and neurologic (headache or confusion) types. More common
signs and symptoms are fever (83% - 98%), cough (76% - 82%), and shortness of breath
(31% - 55%) (Wu et al. 2020). Historically, coronaviruses gained prominence during the
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002-2003 with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the causative agent. The virus infected
8098 individuals with a mortality rate of 9% across twenty-six countries worldwide. In
contrast, the incidence of COVID-19 infection has crossed more than 4.42 million to date
worldwide, indicating increased transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2 (Cheng et al.,2007;
Walls et al., 2020).
According to recent evidence, SARS-CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted between people
through respiratory droplet, direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with
surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (Chan
et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Some scientific studies have provided the
initial evidence for the viability of SARS-CoV-2 virus in aerosols for hours, suggesting their
plausible airborne transmission (van Doremalen et al., 2020). Besides, their human transmissibility can be influenced by the environment in which pathogen and host meet (Pica
and Bauvier 2012). Like other influenza virus infections, relative humidity and temperature
are expected to affect the incidence of COVID-19 particularly through airborne respiratory
droplets (Casanova et al., 2010; Pica and Bauvier, 2012; Lowen and Steel, 2014). The temperature and relative humidity could affect the physicochemical characteristics of infectious
droplet including, pH and salt concentration of droplets as well as viral membrane lipid and

surface proteins and thus influencing their transmission (Lowen and Steel, 2014; Yang and
Marr, 2012). Apart from temperature and relative humidity, the wind velocity also could
play a role in the transmission of the virus.
In most of the earlier works related to the spreading of the epidemic, the rate of increase of
the number of infected individuals has been studied in relation to the various meteorological
determinants (Wang et al., 2020; Prata et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020). However, the
rate would vary between cities because of their differences of total population, area and
population density. Hence, in the present communication a different approach has been
followed to study the spreading of COVID-19 by considering homogeneous mixing in the
populations of various major cities (Spain, Italy and the USA) along with the meteorological
determinants and population density. Under this consideration, the relevant quantity is the
proportionate mixing of the number of infected individuals I, within the total population
N of a city, denoted as I 0 which is equal to

I
.
N

In this work, in the context of infection due

to SARS-CoV-2 virus, we have found the relationship between I 0 with temperature, relative
humidity, wind velocity and time.
COVID-19 cases in the major cities of four countries have been considered for the statistical analysis and building models. The major cities have higher number of COVID-19 cases
and with respect to large population size, almost homogeneous mixing of the population
may be expected. On the other hand, small cities have different heterogeneous issues of
the population, like change in population density, social behavior and movement of people
could be more manifested, which are complicated to be taken into account for the statistical
analysis. As our primary concern is to find the response of the SARS-CoV-2 to different
meteorological factors as well as the global properties of the spreading of the virus over space
and time, the major cities with a higher population are expected to be more appropriate for
the statistical analysis of the data on number of infected cases.
In section 2, the data sources and their collection time period are mentioned. In section
3, regression models are built up from the statistical analysis of the data on the number
of infected persons in various cities, the related meteorological data and the time elapsed
after the initial reporting of infected cases. Mainly based on standardized residual plots and
p values of numerical coefficients of different independent variables, we have found out the
most suitable model in which the proportionate mixing I 0 could depend on temperature,
relative humidity, wind velocity, and time in a statistically significant way. In section 4,

the results of the statistical analysis corresponding to various models have been presented
with the help of different contour plots, which show the combination of temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity for favourable or unfavourable COVID-19 transmission.
Also it has been shown that how the number of infected cases for a particular population,
could evolve with time under various meteorological conditions. In section 5, it has been
discussed through illustrative example, how models indicate the possibility of the partial
natural disappearance of COVID-19 due to the change in the meteorological factors in the
environment. In section 6, the connections of transmission characteristics and viability of
virus under different meteorological conditions, with the structural components of the SARSCoV-2 virus, are discussed. Finally, in section 7, based on models, concluding remarks with
some precautionary measures have been mentioned.

2. Data sources and time period of data collection
All data used for analysis were available in public databases. The data on the number
of COVID-19 infection cases of several major cities in Spain, Italy, and the USA (Countries
with relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak) from the following sources - (1) Data of Spain
(URL: https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov
-China/documentos/Actualizacion 122 COVID-19.pdf) were collected from the database
of the Centro de Coordinacı́ on de Alertas y Emergencias Sanitarias (CCAES), Spain.
The center is responsible for coordinating information management and supporting the
response to national or international health alert or emergencies, (2) Data of Italy (URL:

database (URL: www.worldweatheronline.com).
We have considered data of the cities Madrid, Catalonia and Pais Vasco-Basque in Spain
during the period 4th March, 2020 to 14th March, 2020 before lockdown/travel restrictions
and 15th March to 29th March after lockdown/travel restrictions. We have considered data
of the cities Milan, Bologna and Venice in Italy during the period 26th February, 2020 to
9th March, 2020 before lockdown and 10th March to 31st March after lockdown. We have
considered data of the cities of New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle, Chicago and
Los Angeles in the USA during the period 2nd March, 2020 to 14th March, 2020 before
travel restrictions/stay at home order orders. Data of the cities of New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles in USA were also considered during the period 16th March to 31st March after travel
restrictions/stay at home orders. We have considered data of the cities of Brazil as follows:
Sau Paulo during the period 26th February, 2020 to 23rd March, 2020, Rio de janeiro during
the period 5th March, 2020 to 1st April, 2020 and Brasillia during the period 7th March,
2020 to 5th April, 2020.

3. Regression Models for I 0
Although we have considered data of different cities both before and after lockdown/travel
restrictions, the global features of the spreading of COVID-19 in relation to climatic conditions should be examined before the implementation of restrictions when there were no
human interventions on the transmission of the virus. However, assuming that the early
parts of restrictions were not so stringent in the selected large cities, the combination of
both before and after restrictions data have been considered for statistical analysis. But
while interpreting any results from the analyses of the combined data, one needs to be
careful about this assumption.
In building up regression models, our approach is different from the conventional models
like SIR models (Anderson and May,1979; Jong et al., 1995; Dietz 1985). S, I and R
correspond to the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, respectively.
In some modified models, the number of deaths due to the viral infection has also been
considered. As the aim of this work is to determine the influence of the meteorological
factors on the spreading of virus infection, we are mainly concerned with the number of
infected individuals I. The models of transmission are related to the number of infected
cases at early stage when the role of virus is highly important. At early stage of transmission

of virus, the number of recovered persons or the number related to mortality are much smaller
than the number of infected individuals and also these numbers are more related to health
of the infected persons, health facilities etc., and are not related to the virus explicitly.
Although these numbers do influence S in the early period of the pandemic (which we are
considering), they can be easily ignored because of being relatively much smaller than I.
In finding the connection of the spreading of the virus with the meteorological factors and
time, the proportionate mixing I 0 = I/N will be considered as a parameter for the spreading
of virus and, instead of I, the evolution of the parameter I 0 will be studied. This has the
advantage as the upper limit of the quantity I 0 is normalized to unity for a total population
N in any city. It is legitimate to assume that the evolution of I 0 in different cities will follow
almost same dynamics with respect to the variation of meteorological factors and time.
So same regression model for I 0 is expected to be valid for different cities and in building
such model, different data of different major cities on the number of infected cases may be
considered all together for statistical analysis.
We have not considered a priori any specific form for evolution of I 0 with time T i, like
conventional model that takes into account an exponential increase in the number of infected
cases with respect to time. The reason behind this is that in the SIR models, the rate
of increase in the number of infected persons I with time T i will be proportional to the
proportion of infectious contacts (I/N ). The model assumes that further infections occur
due to the direct contact with the infected people and one follows the principle of mass
action in chemistry where the proportionate mixing I/N stands for the concentration of
some substance. But the spread of viral infections is due to the contacts of a large number
of viruses with the population N and may be compared to some extent, with the scattering
of large number of elementary particles. This is because infections will be happening due
to virus which could be in the air, which could be on the surface of some material, which
could be due to the large number of viruses coming from the nasal and respiratory droplets.
Furthermore, viruses from one infected person, may infect a large or a few number of people
depending on the contacts with the numbers of individuals. The rate of increase in the
number of infected individuals should not be considered to be proportional to the number
of already infected persons I. So considering the viral infection problem as the one similar
to the law of mass action in chemistry may not be correct and the rate of increase may not
be proportional to I/N . In that case, the exponential time dependence which is a solution

to I coming from the first order differential equation in I and time T i in which

dI
dT i

is

proportional to I, may not be correct. For these reasons, in building up regression models,
in the time evolution part of I 0 , we have explored other possible functional forms with time T i
as variable. However, we have also explored the possibility of exponential time dependence,
although that is not necessarily equivalent to considering that

dI
dT i

is proportional to I and

will be explained further in the later part of the paper.
In the absence of our understanding of the relationship of I 0 with time T i at this point of
discussion, I 0 is considered to be depending on two different functions of time : F1 (T i) and
F3 (T i). Also I 0 is expected to depend on various meteorological factors like temperature
(T in 0 C), relative humidity (H in percentage) and wind velocity (W in Km/hr) and for
that another function F2 (T, H, W ) is considered which has no explicit T i dependence and
are separate from F1 (T i) and F3 (T i). The metorological factors T, H and W may or may
not vary with time and but have no explicit time dependence. In terms of these functions
I 0 is written as
I 0 = F2 (T, H, W ) F1 (T i) + F3 (T i) .

(1)

These functions could be related to the interactions of virus with individuals and with environment, viral replication processes and so on. The reason for considering such dependence
is as follows. All the terms in the right hand side, should be proportional to T i. This is
because at T i = 0, I 0 is assumed to be zero or very small. In the product of the two functions
F1 and F2 , it is expected that each additive terms should have T i or its higher power as
a factor, but T, H and W may or may not be present. F3 (T i) is another time dependent
but independent of meteorological variables. Also because of above reason, both F1 (T i) and
F3 (T i) are restricted in the sense that they almost vanish when T i = 0. The rate R of
increase of I 0 with time can be written, as the total derivative for which R = Rtot is written
as

Rtot =

dI 0
dF1 (T i)
dF2 (T, H, W )
dF3 (T i)
=
F2 (T, H, W ) +
F1 (T i) +
.

dT i

where T, H and W are assumed to vary smoothly with time T i. However, under the
assumption that T, H and W are not changing with time T i (which is in general not true,
but may be considered as an approximation for a few days when the values of T, H and W

written as

dT i

=

∂F1 ,3(T i)

∂T i

(3)

We will refer R as Rpart in general.

On the right-hand side of the above equations all terms are related to the properties of
the spreading of virus. To identify these features from our statistical analysis, data on the
number of infection cases of different cities were taken by considering I 0 = I/N corresponding
to different T, H, W, T i values. From the proper fitting with data points, we will determine
the three functions F1 , F2 and F3 .

of three days. These averaged data points were tried to fit with various possible functional
forms of F1 , F2 and F3 . We have considered various forms for these functions including
linear, bi-linear, tri-linear, non-linear and other simpler forms. In this work, three models
are presented as shown in Table I : In Model A, F1 depends on T i2 and F2 depends on
both T and H and F3 is absent. F2 depends linearly in T and H with positive coefficients.
Then there is bilinear term T H with negative coefficients. This is expected to be related
to the condition showing the lack of stability of the virus under certain temperature and
relative humidity subject to the strength of the linear terms in T and H. There are three
parameters evaluated statistically considering best fit with the data and their p values are
shown in Table I. In Model B, F1 depends on T i2.6 and F2 depends on both T and H and
F3 is absent. F2 depends linearly in T with positive coefficients but depends on relative
humidity as H 1.5 . Then there is bilinear term T H with negative coefficients like Model A.
There are three parameters evaluated statistically considering best fit with the data and
their p values are shown in Table I. In Model C, F1 depends on T i2 and F2 depends on T ,
H and W and F3 depends on T i4 . F2 depends linearly in T with positive coefficients but
quadratically on H and W . Then there is bilinear term T H with negative coefficients like
other two models. There are five parameters evaluated statistically considering best fit with
the data and their p values are shown in Table I.
Next, we discuss the validation of the regression models in fitting the data. In obtaining
these three models we have taken care of : 1) Plot of observed and predicted response 2)
Standardized residual plots showing the characteristics of errors in the model with respect
to observed data 3) adjusted R̄2 value which indicates the goodness of fit, 4) the p value for
the parameters appearing as coefficients with the various variables in F1 , F2 and F3 which
indicates what is the probability of the values of those parameters not to be so and 5) the
predictive power of the model beyond data points. Here, by predictive power, it is meant
that at some moderate temperature, I 0 should not vanish for all H or W , as such things have
not been observed. In some cases, the first three points are well-satisfied for some functional
forms of F1 , F2 and F3 but the point 5 is not satisfied and those cases were discarded. These
three models satisfy point 5. Also, in obtaing these three models, we have imposed the
condition p < 0.05 for all numerical coefficients as shown in Table I, for the model to be
statistically significant. In subsequent discussions, based on the first four criteria, we will
discuss merits and demerits of these three models. For statistical analysis, Mathematica

lower part of the Figure.

The best fit for the model will be determined by minimizing the weighted sum of squares
of the deviation between the data and the fit. The weighted sum of squares is given by

where yi is the observed and ŷi the fitted values of the response (which is I 0 for Model A and
I 0 /T i2 for Model B and C) corresponding to the number of infected cases and n is the total
number of data points. It has been expected that ŷi is in general function of T i, T, H, W
and some parameters (aj where j is the number of parameters) appearing as coefficients of
the variables T i, T, H, W . If the weights wi are same for all data points then it may be
considered as 1. The hat matrix H is given by ŷ = Hy where ŷ is the predicted response

vector and y is the observed response vector. H is a n × n matrix where n is the number of
data points. The i-th standardized residuals is the scaled form of the residuals and is given
p
by (yi − ŷi )/( σ̂ 2 (1 − hii )/wi where σ̂ 2 is the estimated error variance including the i-th
data point for standardized residuals, hii is the i-th diagonal element of the hat matrix H
and wi is the weight of the i-th data element. To check the validity of the models, we will
consider standardized residuals plots for different models as shown in Figure 1. Residuals
give a measure of the pointwise difference (yi − ŷi ) between the observed yi and the fitted
values ŷi of the response corresponding to the number of infected cases. These are not true
errors but estimated errors. For statistical analysis, two criterias for errors are (1) they
are normally distributed and in that case, standardized residuals are preferably within ±2
in 95% cases (2) They are uncorrelated, which is expected to reflect in the standardized
residual plots. These may not be totally independent for some F1 which is function of T i.
In that case, heteroscedastic feature will be seen in the standardized residuals. To make
that somewhat homoscedastic, the consideration of some weights wi 6= 1 could be useful. As
for example, with the type of function considered for I 0 for model A (as shown in Table I)
without different weights for different data points, the standardized residuals are found to
be highly heteroscedastic. To avoid that (as required by the criterias for errors mentioned
above), for model A, wi = 1/T i2i have been considered. However, for model B and C,
wi = 1. In Table I, corresponding to each model, the Adjusted R̄2 is shown which represents
the goodness of fit with data and will be considered for comparing models. R2 is the ratio
of the model sum of squares to the total sum of squares. The Adjusted R̄2 is given by
1−

(n−1)
(1
(n−np )

− R2 ) where np is the number of parameters and with increase in np , Adjusted

R̄2 is reduced.
In the upper part of Figure 1 the predicted versus observed I 0 is shown for Model A.
The points which are nearer to the straight line are better fit as the points on the straight
line corresponds to the equality of observed and predicted values. For higher values of
I 0 the fit is not so good. For Model A, if no different weights are considered, then there
is too much heteroscedastic feature in the corresponding standardized plot. Although after
considering weights wi = 1/T i2i for different data, heteroscedasticity is reduced but still little
bit it is there as seen in standardized residual plot for Model A. Removing some outliers or
changing the functional form , does not help much when we consider also the p values for the
parameters to be at least lesser than 0.05 and adjusted R̄2 greater than 0.50. Considering

various possible functional forms of F1 , F2 and F3 , it is found that there should be at least
overall a factor of T i2 in fitting I 0 . Also it could be that because of this factor, the error in F2
and F3 /F1 is getting magnified while considering the error in I 0 . So instead of I 0 , best fit for
I 0 /T i2 has been tried in case of Model B and C and then better homoscedastic standardized
residual plots have been found. In that sense, Model B and C are better than model A.
However, we have to remove a few outliers also to achieve this homoscedastic feature. The
observed versus predicted I 0 /T i2 plots in Figure 1 for Model B and C are better keeping in
mind that the scales are different from that shown for Model A. The adjusted R̄2 is better
for Model C in comparison to other two models as shown in Table I. Combining all these
points, model C seems to be better than other two models. However, it is to be kept in
mind that more data points have been considered for model A. So we will discuss all these
models further.

FIG. 2. Mean prediction band for I 0 at 90% confidence level for different models at T = 300 C ,
H = 40% and W = 10 Km/hr. Blue line corresponds to best fit values.

In Figure 2, the mean prediction band for I 0 has been shown for different models for
different time at 90% confidence level. However, other variables such as T , H and W have
been fixed at T = 300 C , H = 40% and W = 10 Km/hr. For higher number of days, the
band width is shortest for Model C and then comes Model A and then B so far widths are
concerned. Model A and B are independent of W . For Model C, even if W is considered
40 Km/hr instead of 10 Km/hr, the band width for Model C is found to be smaller in
comparison to Model A and B. This is found to be true even at 99% confidence level and
also with the variation of T and H values. So Model C is also better in the sense that it has

lesser uncertainty in the prediction of I 0 as long as W is not above about 40 Km/hr.
In all these models I 0 varies as T i2 or with higher powers of T i and

∂2I 0
∂T i2

is always non-zero.

For that, the rate of increase in the number of COVID-19 cases increases with at some rate.
This will be further explained at the end of the result in section 4. For F1 , the exponential
form eC1 T i (where C1 is a parameter) has also been tried. In such case, one could write
dI 0
dT i

∝ C3 I 0 which is somewhat like SIR models considered extensively. But that kind of F1

does not give proper satistical validity of the model so far data is concerned. So it seems
difficult to get SIR kind of models for the transmission of COVID-19.
In this study on transmission of COVID-19, we are concerned with the number of infected
individuals. At present, there is no evidence of gendered impact on this number of infected
individuals, although there seem to be some impact on the number of mortality due to
the disease (Clare Wenham, Julia Smith, Rosemary Morgan, on behalf of the Gender and
COVID-19 Working Group†, March 6, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)305262). So our analysis is not expected to have gendered impact. The distribution of population
in different age groups in Spain, Italy and the USA do not differ much. Based on World
Bank Data in 2017, the percentage of population in age group of 0-14, 15-64 and 65+ in
years may be considered about 15%, 65% and 20% respectively for these three countries.
For Brazil, these are are about 21%, 70% and 9%. If the number of infected individuals
in different age groups follow the same distribution then one may conclude that the age of
individuals is not playing any role in the infection due to SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, it
seems that for the age group 0-14 years the number of infected cases is much lower than
15% for all these three countries. So it could be expected that there is different infection
rate in different age groups in different countries, But due to lack of availability of data of
number of infected persons based on age groups, in different cities, we have refrained from
doing the analysis based on age groups. We have not analysed the data of infected cases
where lock-down/travel restrictions have been imposed quite early like the case of India.
Depending on the nature of restrictions, probably I 0 (as shown by the models in Table -I)
is to be scaled in such cases by some overall factor.

A, B and C respectively. One may compare different zones of temperature and relative
humidity where the virus is expected to cause more or less infection or no infection. To get
the number of cases, I 0 has been multiplied by the total population N . In Figure 3, 4 and
5, we have considered I 0 in first 20 days and first 40 days after initial infection. The plots
are shown considering the same temperature and relative humidity for the entire period.
We have discussed the variations of temperature and humidity in Section 5. Due to the
variations in the environment in different places, the number of cases will be different than
what has been shown. However, these figures will give the understanding of how virus is
viable under different weather conditions.
In Table 1, it is seen that F2 in Model A depends on T and H only. Wind speed W
does not play any role. There is no F3 part in I 0 . In Model A, in Figure 3, for lower
temperature around −100 C, viral infections are expected for relative humidity above about
35 %. The unshaded regions in Figure 1 correspond to absence of viral infections for the
corresponding temperatures and relative humidities. The infections are not expected in the
unshaded region in Figure 3, for temperature from −20 C to −100 C and relative humidity 0
to 35%. For higher temperature, the viral infections are not expected in the unshaded region
for temperature from 160 C to 450 C and relative humidity 65 to 95%. Higher infections are
expected for higher temperature and lower humidity corresponding to right lower side of

for Model B in the first 20 days and 40 days after the initial cases of infection. Total population

In Table 1, it is seen that F2 in Model B depends on T and H only. Wind speed W does
not play any role like Model A. There is no F3 part in I 0 . However, the total number of cases
as shown in Figure 4, is relatively lesser than that in Model A. In Model B, in Figure 4, for
lower temperature around −100 C, viral infections are expected for relative humidity above
about 30 %. The viral infections are not expected in the unshaded region in Figure 4, for
temperature from −20 C to −100 C and relative humidity 0 to 30%. For higher temperature,
the viral infections are not expected in the unshaded region for temperature from 220 C to
450 C and relative humidity 60 to 95%. Similar to model A, in model B also, higher infections
are expected for higher temperature and lower humidity corresponding to right lower side
of both plots in Figure 4 and lower temperature and higher humidity corresponding to left
upper side of both the plots. These features are true even with the increase in number of
days in this model.
In Table 1, it is seen that unlike earlier two models, F2 in Model C depends on T , H
and also wind speed W and I 0 in Model C, depends on F3 also. In both the contour plots
in Figure 5, wind speed is fixed at W = 10 Km/hr. The total number of cases as shown in

Figure 5, is relatively lesser than those in other two models. In Model C, in Figure 5 for
the left hand side plot for 20 days, for lower temperature around −100 C, viral infections
are expected for relative humidity above about 25 %. Infections are not expected in the
unshaded region in Figure 5 for the left hand side plot for 20 days, for temperature from
−40 C to −100 C and relative humidity 0 to 25%. For higher temperature, infections are not
expected in the unshaded region for temperature from 240 C to 450 C and relative humidity
60 to 95%. Similar to model A and B, in model C also, higher infected cases are expected
for higher temperature and lower humidity corresponding to right lower side of left plot in
Figure 5 and lower temperature and higher humidity corresponding to left upper side of the
left plot for the first 20 days. But unlike other two models, these features change with time,
as can be seen from the right hand side plot in Figure 5. This is due to the presence of
purely time dependent part F3 in case of Model C. Gradually the unshaded regions become
smaller with increase in time and later on do not exist. So viral infections are possible for
wider range of humidity and temperature in Model C with the increase of time after initial
infection.
For Model C, the effect due to the variation of wind velocity in the range 0 to 25 Km/hr

is shown in Figure 6. The regions for no viability of viral infections, related to lower temperature and lower relative humidity and also related to higher temperature and higher relative
humidity; becomes larger for higher wind velocity. This can be seen in both left and right
plots corresponding to 20 and 40 days respectively. Probably it happens because virus are
blown away more by the stronger winds even to the areas where hosts do not come into
contact with the virus easily. However, the total unshaded region decreases with time. So
viral infections are possible for wider range of humidity and temperature as well as wind
velocity in Model C with the increase of time after initial infection.
The rate of increase of number of infected cases is equal to rate of increase of I 0 times N .
The rate of increase of I 0 for different models can be written as
∂I 0
= 2 F2 (T, H, W ) T i (for Model A) ;
∂T i
= 2.6 F2 (T, H, W ) T i1.6 (for Model B) ;
= 2 F2 (T, H, W ) T i + 4 × 2.7413 × 10−9 T i3 (for Model C) .

(5)

F2 in above equation are different for different models as follows from the relationship for
I 0 shown in Table I. In Figure 7, the rate of increase of I 0 written as

∂I 0
∂T i

in equation (5)

is shown for different models for temperature 300 C and relative humidity 50% and wind
speed W = 10 Km/hr. One can see that for Model A,

is increasing linearly with time.

and H values, this is constant in Model A. However, in Model B and in Model C, it is also
varying with time as can be seen in Figure 7.

In Figure 8, considering model (B), an illustrative example of rise and fall of I 0 which also
means the rise and fall of the spreading of the virus, has been presented. Here, the variation
of temperature and relative humidity with time T i has been considered. For simplicity, we
have assumed the changes in temperature and relative humidity are almost instantaneous.
In this example, in the first 20 days, T = 200 C and H = 50 % and in the next 10 days it is
T = 300 C and H = 40 % and after 30 days it is T = 350 C and H = 85 %. To plot I 0 in
these three time periods the following functions for I 0 has been used:
I10 = F2 (T1 , H1 )T i2.6 ;
I20 = F2 (T2 , H2 )T i2.6 + {F2 (T1 , H1 ) − F2 (T2 , H2 )} 202.6 ;
I30 = F2 (T3 , H3 )T i2.6 + {F2 (T1 , H1 ) − F2 (T2 , H2 )} 202.6
+ {F2 (T2 , H2 ) − F2 (T3 , H3 )} 302.6

(6)

in which I10 is to be considered with T i varying from 0 to 20, I20 is to be considered with T i
varying from 20 to 30 and I30 is to be considered with T i varying from 30 onwards.
From Figure 4 for Model (B), one can see that for (T2 , H2 ) , the number of infected cases
is more than that for (T1 , H1 ). So in Figure 8, there is steeper rise in I 0 during 20 to 30
days than that during 0 to 20 days. The (T3 , H3 ) is in the region where viral infections are
not viable in Figure 4. F2 is actually negative in this region which should be interpreted as
the fall in the spreading of the virus with which I 0 is related. Once the weather is in such
no viable (unshaded) region for the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections for some days, one might
expect that COVID-19 could go away. In Figure 8, the period after 30 days, corresponds to
a fall in the spreading of the virus. We have considered that the function F2 (which indicates
the interactions of virus with the environment), will remain the same during this period.
Figure 8 is an illustrative example of how large cities could be partially free from COVID-19
in a natural way due to the change in the meteorological factors in the environment. This
is possible in Model A also. But in Model C this can happen only in very early stage but
later on it is not expected as the unshaded region will not be found later as shown in right
plot in Figure 5. The possiblity of a fall in COVID-19 cases has been discussed due to
only meteorological factors. But this could also be due to the development of immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. No analysis on that aspect has been done here.

6. Connection of transmission characteristics with the structural components of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus
The statistical analysis through function F2 indicates a complex interaction between
COVID-19 infection and meteorological parameters. The infection is expected to enhance
under two different combinations of environmental conditions i.e. lower temperature-higher
humidity and higher temperature-low to ambient humidity as found in Figures 3-5. Such
nature of interaction can be explained by the physicochemical characteristics of respiratory
droplets or aerosol and the structural features of the virus itself. The enveloped virus
SARS-CoV-2 has a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome which encode four important
structural proteins, namely spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), matrix glycoprotein
(M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). The S glycoprotein is surface exposed and mediates the
viral entry into host cells. It comprises two regions S1 and S2, where S1 is responsible for
binding to the receptor of the host cell and S2 is for the fusion of the viral and cellular
membrane. Although both SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attach the host cells through the
binding of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 region to the angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019; Walls et al, 2020), the pandemic impact of the later
happens to be more severe with continuous worldwide increase in the number of infection
cases and mortality.
Several factors including, the structural features of virus for persistence in the environment and for human contact might be associated with the severe infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Recently, an experimental study based on Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein in prefusion conformation has suggested higher binding affinity of SARS-COV-2
with human ACE2 than SARS-COV (Wrapp et al., 2020). Another study on the proteinprotein interaction and molecular dynamics simulations of RBD-ACE2 complex for SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV showed significantly lower binding free energy of the SARS-CoV-2
RBD-ACE2 interaction (-50.43 kcal/mol) compared with SARS-CoVRBD-ACE2 interaction
(-36.75 kcal/mol) and thus suggesting higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2RBD-ACE2
interaction (He et al., 2020). Ou et al., (2020) analyzed the SARS-CoV-2RBD mutations
worldwide and found the equilibrium dissociation constant of three RBD mutants to be
two orders magnitude lower than the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 strain indicating remarkable
increase in the infectivity of the mutated viruses.
Apart from the increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, the severity of

COVID-19 can also be determined by the stability of the virus in the environment. Although most of the studies on the effect of meteorological factors on the COVID-19 have
speculated the decline in infection with an increase in environmental temperature and humidity (He et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), the number of infection cases in reality is
increasing sharply with the rise in temperature. Present study has also indicated such increase at higher temperature as the general feature of the models (Table I) particularly for
lower humidity. The persistence of the virus at higher temperatures can be explained in
the context of the stability of the spike protein because it is a critical component determining the infectivity. A lengthy molecular dynamics simulation of trimeric spike proteins
of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has shown that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly lower total free energy (-67,303.28 kcal/mol) than the spike protein of SAR-CoV
(-63,139.96 kcal/mol). Similarly, the free energy of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
is relatively lower than that of SARS-CoV. The results thus explained increased stability
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at higher temperature (He et al. 2020). Several studies have
been carried out on the effect of relative humidity on the survival and infectivity of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (Benbough 1971; Shaman and Kohn; Pica and Bouvier,
2012; Yang and Marr, 2012; Marr et al. 2019). When the virus is released into the environment as part of a respiratory fluid droplet, relative humidity of environment controls
the amount of water evaporated from the droplet until equilibrium with the surrounding air
is maintained/reached (Prussin et al., 2018). The respiratory viral droplets or aerosol on
exposure to lower to ambient relative humidity environment are subject to evaporation due
to the vapour pressure gradient between its surface and air. As evaporation proceeds, the
water vapour pressure at droplet surface decreases. The presence of lipid membrane in the
enveloped viruses has been evidenced to protect their capsids from damage due to change in
humidity leading to survival at lower humidity conditions (Benbough, 1971; Yang and Marr,
2012). Hence, a considerable higher infection level of SARS-CoV-2 at low to ambient relative
humidity and higher temperature as predicted in the present study could be related to the
presence of structural features of the viral envelope and relatively stable spike protein with
significantly lower free energy. Moreover, at lower relative humidity and higher temperature
the respiratory droplet will undergo evaporation at a higher rate and the desiccated state
of droplet will remain unaffected by the changes in temperature, causing higher infection
rates. Infection can be further enhanced due to higher mobility of the smaller droplets under

high temperature and low humidity which can readily enter the human host. As predicted
in this study, the experiments conducted by Prussin et al. (2018) showed that at 370 C
temperature Phi6, a surrogate of influenza and coronaviruses, had the highest infectivity at
20-40% relative humidity. This happens in all the models as shown in Figures 3-5. However,
in the same experiment the virus showed a significantly higher level of infection throughout
the entire range of relative humidity at lower temperature of 14 and 190 C. Particularly for
Model B and C, this happens for lower temperatures 10 to 200 C throughout the entire range
of humidity as seen in the left plots in Figure 4 and 5 in the first 20 days although with some
variation in the level of infection in comparison to that found for surrogate of influenza and
coronavirus.
On the other hand, our statistical analysis also showed an increase in viral infection at
low temperature and high relative humidity as observed earlier for seasonality of influenza
virus infection, which occurs at a significantly higher level during winters when average
outdoors daily temperatures remains lower and relative humidity is higher (Lowen and Steel,
2014). The finding is also supported by the results of Prussin et al. (2018) reporting higher
infectivity of Phi6 at lower temperature (10−200 C) when relative humidity was kept constant
at 75%. However, according to models in this work, for relative humidity at 75%, increase
in viral infection occurs at further lower temperature than that found for influenza virus.
It is below 00 C in Model A, and in Model B and C, below 100 C as seen in Figures 3-5 in
first 20 days. Probably at higher humidity with appropriate droplet size SARS-CoV-2 could
remain wet by keeping it at slightly higher temperature with respect to the lower surface
temperature of the droplet and thus remains viable for infection.
However, our study indicates a complete reduction in infectivity of the virus under lower
temperature and lower humidity condition. Under such condition, probably SARS-CoV-2
virus could not remain wet inside the droplets which are of smaller size and the lipid and
the protein structure inside the virus gets deformed resulting in a reduction in viability.
Furthermore, the predicted decrease in viral infectivity at a higher temperature and
higher humidity in our models could be due to the reduced rate of evaporation of respiratory droplets at higher humidity, which consequently makes them highly susceptible to
higher temperature resulting in non-viability of SARS-CoV-2 for infection. Furthermore,
corresponding aerosols with bigger size falls down to the surface and loses the mobility.
This also could be a reason for the reduction in the viability of infection of SARS-CoV-2 at

both high temperature and high humidity as indicated by the models.

7. Conclusion
Based on statistical significance, three models may be considered to understand the future
outcome of COVID-19 throughout the world and among them Model C seems better. We
have not considered the data of all COVID-19 affected countries. However, based on Figure
1, it seems that data of different cities of four countries, can be considered in a single
framework of a statistically validated regression model for the evolution of I 0 . Furthermore,
as I 0 is normalized to 1 for any place, it is expected that such models would give a reasonably
good estimate for the evolution of I 0 for the major cities of other countries.
Based on the general features of all the models, it appears that higher precautionary
measures would be required in the cities during the summer season with higher temperature and lower relative humidity, and during winter with low temperature and high relative
humidity. On the other hand, the viability of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be reduced at higher
temperatures with higher humidity and at a lower temperature with lower humidity conditions in the environment, as depicted by the unshaded regions of Figures 3-5. However,
Model C indicates this feature to be valid in the early infections only and may not continue
for prolonged period.
Based on models there is some non-zero rate of increase of

∂I 0
∂T i

with time, which indicates

some acceleration in the spread of the virus. This is related to the function F2 in Model A
and functions F1 , F2 in Model B and F2 and F3 in Model C. These features are expected to
be valid for the spreading of other types of viruses which infect the human host. However,
further studies on exploring such acceleration and the relationship of F2 with the structural
features of SARS-CoV-2 would be worthwhile.
