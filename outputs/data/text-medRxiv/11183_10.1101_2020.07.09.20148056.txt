ABSTRACT
Our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is still developing. We investigated seroprevalence and immune
responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family
members (155 individuals; ages 5–79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein aligned with PCR results that confirmed previous infection. Anti-spike
IgG titers remained high 60 days post-infection and did not associate with symptoms,
but spike-specific IgM did associate with malaise and fever. We found limited
household transmission, with children of infected individuals seldomly seropositive,
highlighting professional exposure as the dominant route of infection in our cohort.
We analyzed PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7
agonist-activation revealed an increased population of IL-6​+​TNF​-​IL-1β​+​ monocytes,
while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicited IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23
expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlated with CD4​+​ T cell activation in
PBMCs from convalescent subjects, and was likely due to T cell-mediated effects on
IL-33-producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic
diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of
published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with
mild to severe COVID-19 revealed a population of IL-33-producing cells that
increases with disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked
to SARS-CoV-2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19
pathogenesis and immunity.

MAIN
We took the opportunity to study a cohort of individuals with a known professional
exposure, within a relatively small timeframe (~2–3 months), as the pandemic was
developing. We assessed viral transmission among these individuals and their family
members. Specifically, we used an ELISA to measure IgG and IgM titers against the
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein​1​. Our study population included 155 subjects who
either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR or were in contact with
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Demographic and disease characteristics of the
study population are indicated in Supplementary Table 1. Median age was 36 years
and 98 (63.2%) were females; 99 (64.5%) had professional exposure to the virus, 44
(28.4%) were exposed within their household and 12 subjects had either multiple or
different/unknown exposure sources. Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection
within the last 16 weeks prior to blood collection were reported by 97 (62.6%)
individuals. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was performed in 87 individuals, with 47
(30.3%) having a positive PCR result. We evaluated the presence and abundance of
antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the serum of the study
population, as well as in 16 historical sera collected prior to the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We found highest antibody titers among individuals with a
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (​Fig. 1a​), as well as a few cases where subjects with a
negative PCR result possessed antibodies against the viral protein (9/40). As the
date of the PCR and the collection of serum samples were separated by a median
time of 49 days, it is possible that these individuals became infected after a PCR was
carried out. Likewise, we discovered few cases (3/47) where a positive PCR result
did not associate with elevated anti-spike IgG titers.

We used the signal measured in pre-exposure sera to set a threshold to define
seropositive and borderline cases (​Fig. 1a​ – black and red dashed lines
respectively). This resulted in 5 borderline cases and 65 seropositive individuals. We
then probed collected sera for IgG and IgM antibodies against the spike protein and
its receptor binding domain (RBD) finding a robust correlation between these
measurements (​Fig. 1b–c, i ​and​ Extended Data Fig. 1a–e​). Most seropositive
subjects reported experiencing symptoms (​Fig. 1d​). We discovered only 6
asymptomatic individuals out of 65 seropositive subjects (2/8 borderline cases) who
nonetheless had high anti-spike IgG titers (​Fig. 1d​) although anti-RBD IgG titers
were appreciatively lower (​Fig. 1e​). We found no association between sex and
antibody titers (​Fig. 1f–g​). To explore possible links between clinical features and
antibody titers, we probed our data with two complementary strategies. First, we
fitted logistic regression models to reported symptoms among seropositive subjects
(​Fig. 1h ​and​ Extended Data Fig. 1f–h​), setting the symptom report (yes = 1, no = 0)
as the outcome predicted by the antibody titer and calculating the deviance of the
model as a measure of accuracy. Within our cohort, elevated IgM levels against
spike and RBD were reasonable predictors of experiencing malaise and fever (​Fig.
1h ​and​ Extended Data Fig. 1f–g​), but not for other symptoms (​Extended Data Fig.
1h​). These results might suggest that people with strong immune responses against
the virus feel sicker during acute infection, but also have persistent IgM antibodies as
a result of this stronger antiviral response. Next, we calculated the Kendall’s rank
correlation coefficient (𝜏) between symptom duration, subject age, and antibody titers
in pairs (​Fig. 1i​). Beyond the strong correlation between IgG and IgM titers for both

spike and RBD, we found modest to no correlation among clinical features. Finally,
we observed no appreciable drop in antibody titers in the study population, even 60
days after active infection (​Fig. 1j–k ​and​ Extended Data Fig. 1i–j​).

We sought to visualize viral transmission within our study population by generating
an undirected network of interactions based on subject exposure history (​Fig. 2a​).
We limited our analysis to subjects with professional exposure plus all their adjacent
nodes. The dense and highly connected center of the network corresponds to
professional exposure, while family groups within households are arranged in the
periphery (​Fig. 2a​). We observed that a large subset of our study population was
linked by an episode of professional exposure resulting in infection, however the
extent to which this event caused viral spread to subjects’ households was limited. In
fact, upon closer analysis of household groupings (​Fig. 2b​) we found low levels of
transmission. Indeed, when we measured the assortativity of these household
network groups, as a proxy for viral transmission rate, we confirmed that for a
network of the size and distribution of our study the observed assortativity with
respect to serology status and IgG titers was remarkably low (​Fig. 2c​ - observed
assortativity in red) indicating a low transmission rate. Children (thicker edged
nodes) in particular were seldomly positive in our serology results (3/12), despite
coming into contact with infected individuals with high anti-spike IgG titres.

SARS-CoV-2 represents a unique public health challenge in modern times, with the
possibility of subsequent waves of infection being an active area of research. While
antibodies can neutralize the virus and are therefore likely to be important for

protective immunity​2​, it is probable that the pathologic effects of SARS-CoV-2
infection are cell-mediated. The development of IgG antibodies during infection is
indication that a CD4​+​ T follicular helper cell response is mounted against this
virus​3,4​, and recent work has indicated that both CD4​+​ and CD8​+​ T cells capable of
making IFN-γ and TNF are present within the blood of convalescent patients​4–6​. We
therefore decided to look broadly at cellular immune responses in convalescent
patients. We focused on both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T cell responses
and innate monocyte responses, and measured cytokines known to be produced by
both adaptive and innate immune cells. We did this for a subset of 20 convalescent
individuals in our cohort, comparing them to 20 seronegative subjects in our study
(Supp. Table 2). We purified PBMCs from these individuals and examined their
composition (​Fig. 3a–d​) and activation following stimulation (​Fig. 3a, e–h​),
correlating these results to antibody titers (​Fig. 3​ in bold) using conventional markers
(​Extended Data Fig. 2​) and 2 different stimuli (​Fig. 3a​). Overall, we did not detect a
strong association between the cellular composition, immune cell activation, time
from active infection, and antibody titers, (​Fig. 3​ and​ Extended Data Fig.​ ​3​) with the
latter more closely associated with subject age than any other measured parameter
(​Fig. 3b–f​). We also observed a bimodal distribution of seropositive subjects, with
the studied population clustering in 2 separate groups (​Fig. 3​) indicating an
underlying complexity in our cohort. However, upon examination of TLR7-driven
classical monocyte activation (​Fig. 3g​), we discovered that the percentage of
IL-6​+​TNF​-​IL-1β​+​ monocytes clustered closely with IgG titers. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2
peptide-induced production of IL-33, IL-6, IFN-ɑ2 and IL-23 in these cultures (​Fig.
3h​) also clustered together with IgG titers. Critically, IL-33 production was more

closely related to IgG titers than any other measured parameter (​Extended Data
Fig. 3​), including subject age.

While resistance to infection is likely to involve cytokines such as IFN-γ produced by
T cells, many of the symptoms associated with severe COVID-19 appear to be linked
to excessive production of innate cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β​7​. Consequently,
we felt that the results highlighting IL-33, IL-6, IFN-ɑ2, IL-23 and IL-1β production
(​Fig. 3​) could be important. In line with our clustering analysis, we found that all
highlighted features were in fact significantly increased in seropositive subjects (​Fig.
4a–e​). We reasoned that the observed cytokine production (​Fig. 4a–d​) should be a
result of T cell activation, as our experimental strategy favours this mechanism. We
found that this could be the case for IL-33, which had a strong positive correlation
with CD69 expression in CD4​+​ T cells (​Fig. 4f​). However, this was not the case for
other parameters (​Fig. 4g–i​) and not unexpectedly for the percentage of
IL-6​+​TNF​-​IL-1β​+​ monocytes (​Fig. 4j​).

To our knowledge, there are no reports associating IL-33 with COVID-19 and given
the strong correlation we observed in our data we decided to explore this result in
more detail. To accomplish this, we retrieved single cell RNA sequencing data from a
recent publication​8​ and processed it to interrogate ​IL33​ expression in the setting of
SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary disease (​Fig. 4k–q​ and​ Extended Data Fig. 4​). These data
were generated from cells in BALF of 3 healthy donors and 9 acutely SARS-CoV-2
infected patients, 3 of whom displayed mild symptoms, while the remaining 6 were
classed as severely ill (​Extended Data Fig. 4​). In these data, we identified 2

potential sources of IL-33 production coming from 3 distinct cell clusters (​Fig. 4k–l​).
Strikingly, ​IL33​ expression was confined to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (​Fig. 4m​),
concomitant with the increased appearance of the ​IL33+​​ cell clusters as a result of
disease (​Extended Data Fig. 4​). ​IL33​+​ cell clusters were most likely stromal cells
(​Fig. 4n–q​) and are unlikely to be responsible for the IL-33 production we observed
in PBMC cultures. However, these clinical data further implicate IL-33 in COVID-19
immunobiology.

Here we show that after the resolution of infection, an innate immune cytokine
signature persists in PBMCs of convalescent subjects, characterized by induction of
IL-33 in response to T cell activation with 14-mer peptides, a peptide length
suggestive of CD4​+​ T cell activation​9​. However, the identity and mechanism of
activation of the IL-33-producing cells in the PBMCs from convalescent individuals
remain unclear at this time. IL-33 was initially described as a cytokine produced as
an alarmin by epithelial cells to induce type 2 immune responses​10​, and of interest in
this regard, there are reports of eosinophilia, a mark of type 2 immunity, in COVID-19
patients​11​. IL-33 is also linked to lung injury, pulmonary viral infections, and chronic
lung diseases​12​. COVID-19 can cause complications such as pneumonia and acute
respiratory distress syndrome, as well as invoke lasting damage to lungs, including
lung remodeling and fibrosis, which are consistent with known roles of IL-33​13​. These
observations suggest that IL-33 could participate in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
On the other hand, IL-33 has also been reported to promote antiviral cytotoxic T cell
responses​14–16​ and higher antibody production​17,18​. Thus the presence of a persistent
population of cells capable of making IL-33 in response to T cell activation may

be needed to elucidate the role of this cytokine in COVID-19.

METHODS
Human subjects
All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Medical Center - University of Freiburg (305/20). The study was registered at the
German Clinical Trial Register (​DRKS00022292​). Pre-exposure donor serum
samples (n=16) had been collected, aliquoted and stored at the Medical Center University of Freiburg prior to June 1st, 2019. These individuals were considered to
be pre-exposure controls since their biological material had been stored prior to the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2. This cohort included 50% males (n=8) and 50%
females. Median age was 51 years with a range of 39–77 years.
SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects (n=155) were recruited with a standardized
procedure based on assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria
were contact to SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, age of at least 5 years and the
ability to provide a written informed consent. The exclusion criterium was the
presence of symptoms of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (fever, cough, malaise)
within the last 14 days prior to blood collection. Study participants gave their written
informed consent prior to study enrollment. For subjects <18 years of age, written
informed consent was provided by one parent. Collection of biological material was
performed at the Medical Center - University of Freiburg. Serum and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at one or two time points. All
samples were de-identified and analyzed in a pseudonymized manner. Information
on demographic characteristics and disease course was provided by the subjects
using a standardized questionnaire filled at the time point of enrollment. Information
on age, sex, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, symptom duration, treatment

and exposure were analyzed. The cohort included 98 females (63.2%) and 57 males
(36.8%). Median age was 36 years with a range of 5–79 years. Further
characteristics are included in Supplementary Table 1.

Serum asservation and ELISA
Serum was collected in tubes containing clot activators (7.5 ml) and stored at room
temperature prior to processing. Tubes were centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min and
serum was aliquoted and stored at -20 °C.

Serology
Collected serum was analyzed for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
proteins by adapting a serology assay developed in the laboratory of Dr. Florian
Krammer​1​, with some alterations to the protocol. Recombinant spike protein and its
receptor binding domain (RBD) were expressed from mammalian expression
plasmids kindly donated by Dr. Krammer​1​. Recombinant proteins were produced
employing the Expi293 Expression System (Thermo) following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Briefly, cells were grown to exponential phase in serum-free
optimized media, then transfected with plasmid-lipid complexes prepared with
Expifectamine. 20 h later media were supplemented with expression enhancers and
finally media containing recombinant proteins was harvested 72 h later. Proteins
were purified by passing media through Ni-NTA Sepharose columns. Purity and
identity of recombinant proteins was established by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.

96-well flat bottom plates (Corning) were coated with 2 µg/ml of recombinant proteins
overnight at 4 °C. Blocking was performed with 200 µl/well PBS containing 0.05%
Tween-20 (PBS/T) and 3% milk for 4 h. Serum samples were diluted 1:50, 1:200,
1:800 and 1:3200 performing serial dilutions in PBS/T containing 1% milk. Serum
samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed four times
with PBS/T and incubated with an anti-human IgG or IgM secondary antibody
(dilution 1:3000, Sigma or Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature.
Plates were washed four times with PBS/T and developed using a TMB substrate kit
(Biolegend) for 5 min at room temperature. Colorimetric reaction was stopped by the
addition of 2N H​2​SO​4​. Internal positive and negative standards were included on
each plate to allow for data normalization between different plates. Absorbance at
450 nm was measured using a TriStar microplate reader (Berthold Technologies).

PBMC collection
Peripheral blood from 20 seronegative and 20 seropositive subjects (based on
anti-spike IgG ELISA) was collected in EDTA-coated tubes and stored at 4 °C prior
to processing. Blood was diluted 1:1 with PBS containing 2% FCS and 1 mM EDTA.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using a density gradient
method. Lymphoprep solution (Stem Cell) was pipetted to the bottom of SepMate-50
tubes (Stem Cell), and diluted blood carefully layered on top. After 10 min
centrifugation at 1200 x g, the upper phase containing mononuclear cells was
transferred to a new tube. PBMCs were washed twice with PBS with 2% FCS and 1
mM EDTA. After counting, cells were aliquoted, frozen in FCS containing 10%
DMSO and stored at -80 °C.

SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation
PBMCs were thawed and rested in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin, 4 mM glutamine and 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h. 4x10​5
PBMCs were incubated with 2 µg/ml SARS-CoV-2 spike PepMix (JPT) or DMSO
control in the presence of 2 µg/ml anti-CD28 and 50 U/ml hIL-2. The PepMix
includes a total of 315 14-mer peptides covering the whole spike protein. Incubation
was performed for 24 h with addition of 5 µg/ml Brefeldin A (Biolegend) for the last 4
h to block cytokine secretion. DMSO controls served as negative controls.

TLR7 agonist stimulation
2x10​5 ​PBMCs were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin and 4 mM glutamine supplemented with 5 µg/ml Brefeldin A
and 5 µg/ml Resiquimod (Invivogen) or water control for 4 h.

Flow cytometry
Prior to cell surface staining, PBMCs were incubated with purified NA/LE Human BD
Fc block (BD, dilution 1:300) and Live/Dead Fixable Aqua or Live/Dead Fixable Blue
(both Thermo Fisher, dilution 1:1000) in FACS buffer (2% FCS and 1 mM EDTA in
PBS) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and incubated with cell surface
antibody cocktails for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with FACS buffer and fixed
using BD Cytofix Fixation Buffer (for intracellular cytokine staining) or eBioscience
Fixation/Permeabilization kit (for Foxp3 staining) for 20 min at room temperature. For
intracellular staining assays, cells were washed twice with 1x BD Perm/Wash buffer

or 1x eBioscience Perm/Wash buffer prior to incubation with intracellular antibody
cocktails for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 1x BD
Perm/Wash buffer or 1x eBioscience Perm/Wash buffer and resuspended in FACS
buffer. Flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa or BD
FACSymphony flow cytometer.

Cytokine measurement
Supernatants from PBMCs cultured with SARS-CoV-2 PepMix or DMSO control as
described above were collected and stored at -20 °C. Cytokines in culture media
were detected using the Legendplex™ Human Inflammation Panel 1 (Biolegend,
Cat# 740809) following the manufacturer's instructions. This kit allows for
simultaneous measurement of IL-1β, IFNα2, IFNγ, TNF, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23 and IL-33. Briefly, standards and cell culture
supernatants were incubated on a 96-well V-bottom plate with capture beads for 2 h.
The plate was washed and biotinylated detection antibodies were added to each well
for 1 h, followed by Streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) addition for 30 min. Samples
were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. All steps were carried out at room
temperature. Results were obtained using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer. Data
analysis was performed in FlowJo. Cytokines were identified based on the size and
internal dye of the beads. Cytokine concentration in samples was derived from the
geometric mean fluorescence intensity for PE interpolated from standard curves
calculated from 8 standard controls measured in duplicate.

Data analysis and Statistics

Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.6. Clinical data, ELISA
readings, flow cytometry results and single cell RNA sequencing data were
processed and analyzed using R (Lucent Technologies), which was also employed
to generate graphs.

Antibody titers:
Background measurements were subtracted from absorbance readings, which were
then batch corrected based on internal standards included on each plate. Batch and
background corrected data were then used to calculate the area under the dilution
curve (AUC) for each subject. To calculate a seropositivity threshold, a subset of
AUC values was extracted, composed of all pre-pandemic sera as well as those
subjects with an AUC lower than the maximum obtained from pre-exposure sera and
with no SARS-CoV-2 PCR or with a negative PCR result. Borderline cases were
defined as being 2 standard deviations away from the mean AUC from this sample
subset, while AUC results at least 3 standard deviations away from the mean were
taken as seropositive. All other values were defined as seronegative.

Symptoms, age and titer associations:
The relationship between antibody titers, subject age and reported symptoms were
explored in two parallel ways. First, antibody titers were used to fit a logistic
regression model capable of predicting the presence of reported symptoms (yes = 1,
no = 0). The deviance of each model was used to estimate the quality of the fit. Next,
antibody titers, subject age, and symptom duration in days were correlated with one
another using Kendall’s rank correlation and reporting 𝜏 as the correlation coefficient.

Only complete pairs of observations were used in correlations and all data was
scaled by subtracting the mean of each feature and dividing by the corresponding
standard deviation.

Network analysis:
An adjacency matrix was generated for the network of subject interactions based on
reported exposures. Subjects with suspected professional exposure to SARS-CoV-2,
who shared a workplace, were connected to each other. Subjects belonging to the
households of professionally exposed individuals were added to the network, with
interactions within households included. Only subjects with known professional
exposure and with at least one household connection were included in this analysis.
To estimate viral transmission within households, a network was constructed
exclusively with household interactions and later the assortativity of the network was
estimated with regards to serological results and antibody titers. Observed
assortativities were compared to those calculated based on 10000 permutations of
used values over the same network architecture. Network visualization, analysis and
construction was performed with igraph v.1.2.5.

Immunophenotyping clustering and regression
Flow cytometry results were collected and stimulation controls were subtracted from
values obtained for treatments. Corrected values were subsequently scaled and
clustered based on Euclidean distances to antibody titers and subject age, which
were similarly scaled. Heatmaps and clustering were obtained by using pheatmap
v.1.0.12. Selected features were correlated with one another using a linear

regression model (y ~ x) and reporting R squared as an indication of the quality of
the fit.

Single cell RNA sequencing analysis:
The transcriptional profiles of ~90000 single cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
from 3 healthy individuals and 9 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (3 with mild and 6
with severe disease) were retrieved from a publicly available repository
(GSE145926). Matrices with raw unfiltered read counts for detected features in
barcoded cells were downloaded for each subject and subsequently processed,
analyzed and visualized in R using Seurat v. 3​19​, removing cells with a high
percentage of mitochondrial RNA over total RNA (> 25%) and with less than 200
detected features, normalizing gene expression data by applying regularized
negative binomial regression​20​ and using a Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)​21​ as a dimensionality reduction approach. Differentially expressed
genes within each cluster and across conditions were determined with Seurat as
those with a greater than 1.2 fold change and an adjusted p value of less than 0.05.
