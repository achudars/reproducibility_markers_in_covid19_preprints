ABSTRACT
Objective To estimate the infection fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from
data of seroprevalence studies.
Methods Population studies with sample size of at least 500 and published as peer-reviewed
papers or preprints as of July 11, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, preprint servers, and
communications with experts. Studies on blood donors were included, but studies on healthcare
workers were excluded. The studies were assessed for design features and seroprevalence
estimates. Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19
deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region.
Correction was also attempted accounting for the types of antibodies assessed. Secondarily,
results from national studies were also examined from preliminary press releases and reports
whenever a country had no other data presented in full papers of preprints.
Results 36 studies (43 estimates) were identified with usable data to enter into calculations and
another 7 preliminary national estimates were also considered for a total of 50 estimates.
Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.222% to 47%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00%
to 1.63% and corrected values ranged from 0.00% to 1.31%. Across 32 different locations, the
median infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.24%). Most studies were done in pandemic
epicenters with high death tolls. Median corrected IFR was 0.10% in locations with COVID-19
population mortality rate less than the global average (<73 deaths per million as of July 12, 2020),
0.27% in locations with 73-500 COVID-19 deaths per million, and 0.90% in locations exceeding
500 COVID-19 deaths per million. Among people <70 years old, infection fatality rates ranged
from 0.00% to 0.57% with median of 0.05% across the different locations (corrected median of
0.04%).

Conclusions The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different
locations and this may reflect differences in population age structure and case-mix of infected and
deceased patients as well as multiple other factors. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred
from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early
days of the pandemic.

The infection fatality rate (IFR), the probability of dying for a person who is infected, is
one of the most critical and most contested features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. The expected total mortality burden of COVID-19 is directly related to the IFR.
Moreover, justification for various non-pharmacological public health interventions depends
crucially on the IFR. Some aggressive interventions that potentially induce also more pronounced
collateral harms1 may be considered appropriate, if IFR is high. Conversely, the same measures
may fall short of acceptable risk-benefit thresholds, if the IFR is low.
Early data from China, adopted also by the World Health Organization (WHO),2 focused
on a crude case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.4%; CFR is the ratio of COVID-19 deaths divided by the
number of documented cases, i.e. patients with symptoms who were tested and found to be PCRpositive for the virus. The WHO envoy who visited China also conveyed the message that there
are hardly any asymptomatic infections.3 With a dearth of asymptomatic infections, the CFR
approximates the IFR. Other mathematical models suggested that 40-70%,4 or even5 81% of the
global population would be infected. Influential mathematical models5,6 eventually dialed back to
an IFR of 1.0% or 0.9%, and these numbers long continued to be widely cited and used in both
public and scientific circles. The most influential of these models, constructed by Imperial College
estimated 2.2 million deaths in the USA and over half a million deaths in the UK in the absence of
lockdown measures.5 Such grave predictions justifiably led to lockdown measures adopted in
many countries. With 0.9% assumed infection fatality rate and 81% assumed proportion of people
infected, the prediction would correspond to a global number of deaths comparable with the 1918
influenza, in the range of 50 million fatalities.
Since late March 2020, many studies have tried to estimate the extend of spread of the
virus in various locations by evaluating the seroprevalence, i.e. how many people in population
samples have developed antibodies for the virus. These studies can be useful because they may

inform about the extend of under-ascertainment of documenting the infection based on PCR
testing. Moreover, they can help obtain estimates about the IFR, since one can divide the number
of observed deaths by the estimated number of people who are inferred to have been infected.
At the same time, seroprevalence studies may have several caveats in their design,
conduct, and analysis that may affect their results and their interpretation. Here, data available as
of July 11, 2020 were collected, scrutinized, and used to infer estimates of IFR in different
locations where these studies have been conducted.
METHODS
Seroprevalence studies
The input data for the calculations of IFR presented here are studies of seroprevalence of
COVID-19 that have been done in the general population, or in samples that might approximate
the general population (e.g. with proper reweighting) and that have been published in peerreviewed journals or have been submitted as preprints as of July 11, 2020. Only studies with at
least 500 assessed samples were considered, since smaller datasets would entail extremely large
uncertainty for any calculations to be based on them. When studies focused on making
seroprevalence assessments at different time interval, they were eligible if at least one time
interval assessment had a sample size of at least 500 participants; among different eligible time
points, the one with the highest seroprevalence was selected, since seroprevalence may decrease
over time as antibody titers wane. Studies with data collected over more than a month, and that
could not be broken into at least one eligible time interval that did not exceed one month in
duration were excluded, since it would not be possible to estimate a point seroprevalence with any
reliability. Studies were eligible regardless of the exact age range of included participants, but
studies including only children were excluded.

Studies where results were only released through press releases were not considered here,
since it is very difficult to tell much about their design and analysis, and this is fundamental in
making any inferences based on their results. Nevertheless, secondarily, results from national
studies were also examined from preliminary press releases and reports whenever a country had
no other data presented in full papers of preprints as of July 11, 2020. This allowed these countries
to be represented in the collected data, but extra caution is required given the preliminary nature of
this information. Preprints should also be seen with caution since they have not been yet fully
peer-reviewed (although some of them have already been revised based on very extensive
comments from the scientific community). However, in contrast to press releases, preprints
typically offer at least a fairly complete paper with information about design and analysis.
Studies done of blood donors were eligible, although it is possible they may underestimate
seroprevalence and overestimate IFR due to healthy volunteer effect. Studies done on health care
workers were not eligible, since they deal with a group at potentially high exposure risk which
may lead to seroprevalence estimates much higher than the general population and thus
implausibly low IFR. For a similar reason, studies focused on communities (e.g. shelters or
religious or other shared-living communities) were also excluded. Studies were eligible regardless
of whether they aimed to evaluate seroprevalence in large or small regions, provided that the
population of reference in the region was at least 5000 people.
Searches were made in PubMed (LitCOVID), medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Research Square
using the terms “seroprevalence” and “antibodies” with continuous updates (last update July 11,
2020). Communication with colleagues who are field experts sought to ascertain if any major
studies might have been missed.
Information was extracted from each study on location, recruitment and sampling strategy,
dates of sample collection, sample size, types of antibody used (IgG, IgM, IgA), estimated crude

seroprevalence (positive samples divided by all samples test), and adjusted seroprevalence and
features that were considered in the adjustment (sampling process, test performance, presence of
symptoms, other).
Calculation of inferred IFR
Information on the population of the relevant location was collected from the papers.
Whenever it was missing, it was derived based on recent census data trying to approximate as
much as possible the relevant catchment area (e.g. region(s) or county(ies)), whenever the study
did not pertain to an entire country. Some studies targeted specific age groups (e.g. excluding
elderly people and/or excluding children) and some of them made inferences on number of people
infected in the population based on specific age groups. For consistency, the entire population, as
well as, separately, only the population with age <70 years were used for estimating the number of
infected people. It was assumed that the seroprevalence would be similar in different age groups,
but significant differences in seroprevalence according to age strata that had been noted by the
original authors were also recorded to examine the validity of this assumption.
The number of infected people was calculated multiplying the relevant population with the
adjusted estimate of seroprevalence. Whenever an adjusted seroprevalence estimate had not been
obtained, the unadjusted seroprevalence was used instead. When seroprevalence estimates with
different adjustments were available, the analysis with maximal adjustment was selected.
For the number of COVID-19 deaths, the number of deaths recorded at the time chosen by
the authors of each study was selected, whenever the authors used such a death count up to a
specific date to make inferences themselves. If the choice of date had not been done by the
authors, the number of deaths accumulated until after 1 week of the mid-point of the study period
was chosen. This accounts for the differential delay in developing antibodies versus dying from
the infection. It should be acknowledged that this is an averaging approximation, because some

patients may die very soon (within <3 weeks) after infection (and thus are overcounted), and
others may die very late (and thus are undercounted due to right censoring).
The inferred IFR was obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of infected
people for the entire population, and separately for people <70 years old. The proportion of
COVID-19 deaths that occurred in people <70 years old was retrieved from situational reports for
the respective countries, regions, or counties in searches done in June 3-7 for studies published
until June 7 and in July 3-11 for studies published later. A corrected IFR is also presented, trying
to account for the fact that only one or two types of antibodies (among IgG, IgM, IgA) might have
been used. Correcting seroprevalence upwards (and inferred IFR downwards) by 1.1-fold for not
performing IgM measurements and similarly for not performing IgA measurements may be
reasonable, based on some early evidence,7 although there is uncertainty about the exact correction
factor.
Data synthesis considerations
Inspection of the IFR estimates across all locations showed vast heterogeneity with
heterogeneity I2 exceeding 99.9% and thus a meta-analysis would be inappropriate to report across
all locations. Quantitative synthesis with meta-analysis across all locations would also be
misleading since locations with high seroprevalence would tend to carry more weight than
locations with low seroprevalence; locations with more studies (typically those that have attracted
more attention because of high death tolls and thus high IFRs) would be represented multiple
times in the calculations; and more sloppy studies with fewer adjustments would get more weight,
because they would have spuriously tighter confidence intervals than more rigorous studies with
more careful adjustments allowing for more uncertainty. Finally, with a highly skewed IFR
distribution and with extreme between-study heterogeneity, synthesis with a typical random
effects model would tend to produce an erroneously high summary IFR that approximates the

mean of the study-specific estimates (also heavily driven by hotbed high-mortality locations with
more studies done), while for a skewed distribution the median is more appropriate.
Therefore, at a first step, IFR estimates from studies done in the same country (or in the
US, the same state) were grouped together and a single IFR was obtained for that location,
weighting the study-specific IFRs by the sample size of each study. This allowed to avoid giving
inappropriately more weight to studies with higher seroprevalence estimates and those with
seemingly tighter confidence intervals because of poor or no adjustments, while still giving more
weight to larger studies. Then, a single summary estimate was used for each location and the
median of the distribution of location-specific IFR estimates was calculated. Finally, it was
explored whether the location-specific IFRs were associated with the COVID-19 mortality rate in
the population (COVID-19 deaths per million people) in each location as of July 12, 2020; this
allowed to assess whether IFR estimates tend to be higher in harder hit locations.
RESULTS
Seroprevalence studies
36 studies with a total of 43 eligible estimates were published either in the peer-reviewed
literature or as preprints as of July 11, 2020.8-43 Dates and processes of sampling and recruitment
are summarized in Table 1, sample sizes, antibody types assessed and regional population appear
in Table 2, estimated prevalence, and number of people infected in the study region are
summarized in Table 3, and number of COVID-19 and inferred IFR estimates are found in Table
4. Several studies performed repeated seroprevalence surveys at different time points, and only the
time point with the highest seroprevalence estimate is considered in the calculations. With three
exceptions, this is also the latest time point. Furthermore, another 7 preliminary national estimates
were also considered (Table 5)44-50 from countries that had no other seroprevalence study
published as a full paper or preprint. This yielded a total of 50 eligible estimates.

At least seven studies found some statistically significant, modest differences in
seroprevalence rates across some age groups (Oise: decreased seroprevalence in age 0-14,
increased in age 15-17; Geneva: decreased seroprevalence in age >50; Netherlands: increased
seroprevalence in age 18-30; New York state: decreased seroprevalence in age >55; Brooklyn:
decreased seroprevalence in age 0-5, increased in age 16-20; Tokyo: increased seroprevalence in
age 18-34, Spain: decreased seroprevalence in age 0-10, Belgium: higher seroprevalence in age
>90). The patterns are not strong enough to suggest major differences in extrapolating across age
groups, although higher values in adolescents and young adults and lower values in children
cannot be excluded.
As shown in Table 1, these studies varied substantially in sampling and recruitment
designs. The main issue is whether they can offer a representative picture of the population in the
region where they are performed. A generic problem is that vulnerable people who are at high risk
of infection and/or death may be more difficult to recruit in survey-type studies. COVID-19
infection seems to be particularly widespread and/or lethal in nursing homes, among homeless
people, in prisons, and in disadvantaged minorities. Most of these populations are very difficult, or
even impossible to reach and sample from and they are probably under-represented to various
degrees (or even entirely missed) in surveys. This would result in an underestimation of
seroprevalence and thus overestimation of IFR. Eleven of the 36 studies that are available as full
papers (Iran,8 Geneva,10 Gangelt,16 Rio Grande do Sul,17 Luxembourg,20 Los Angeles county,22
three Brazil studies,25,34,42, Spain,36 and Louisiana37) explicitly aimed for random sampling from
the general population. In principle, this is a stronger design. However, even with such designs,
people who cannot be reached (e.g. by e-mail or phone or even visiting them at a house location)
will not be recruited, and these vulnerable populations are likely to be missed. Moreover, 5 of
these 11 studies8,10,16,42,37 focused on studying geographical locations that had extreme numbers of

deaths, higher than other locations in the same city or country, and this would tend to select
eventually for higher IFR on average.
Seven studies assessed blood donors in Denmark,12 Netherlands,15 Scotland,18 the Bay
Area in California,24 Zurich/Lucerne,28 Apulia31 and Rio De Janeiro.41 By definition these studies
include people in good health and without symptoms, at least recently, and therefore may
markedly underestimate COVID-19 seroprevalence in the general population. A small set of 200
blood donors in Oise, France13 showed 3% seroprevalence, while pupils, siblings, parents,
teachings and staff at a high school with a cluster of cases in the same area had 25.9%
seroprevalence; true population seroprevalence may be between these two values.
For the other studies, healthy volunteer bias may lead to underestimating seroprevalence
and this is likely to have been the case in at least one case (the Santa Clara study)19 where wealthy
healthy people were rapidly interested to be recruited when the recruiting Facebook ad was
released. The design of the study anticipated correction with adjustment of the sampling weights
by zip code, gender, and ethnicity, but it is likely that healthy volunteer bias may still have led to
some underestimation of seroprevalence. Conversely, attracting individuals who might have been
concerned of having been infected (e.g. because they had symptoms) may lead to overestimation
of seroprevalence in surveys. Finally studies of employees, grocery store clients, or patient cohorts
(e.g. hospitalized for other reasons, or coming to the emergency room, or studies using residual
lab samples) may have sampling bias with unpredictable direction.
As shown in Table 2, all studies have tested for IgG antibodies, but only about half have
also assessed IgM, 4 have assessed IgA. Only three studies assessed all three types of antibodies
and one more used a pan-Ig antibody. Studies typically considered the results to be “positive” if
any tested antibody type was positive, but one study (Luxembourg) that considered the results to
be “positive” only if both IgG and IgA were detected. The ratio of people sampled versus the total

population of the region was better than 1:1000 in 11 studies (Idaho,9 Denmark blood donors,12
Gangelt,16 Santa Clara,19 Luxembourg,20 Brooklyn,27 Zurich,28 San Francisco,33 Espirito Santo,34
Spain,36 and Vitacura43).
Seroprevalence estimates
As shown in Table 3, prevalence ranged from as little as 0.222% to as high as 47%.
Studies varied a lot on whether they tried or not to adjust their estimates for test performance,
sampling (striving to get closer to a more representative sample), and clustering effects (e.g. when
including same household members) as well as other factors. The adjusted seroprevalence
occasionally differed substantially from the crude, unadjusted value. In principle adjusted values
are likely to be closer to the true estimate, but the exercise shows that each study alone may have
some unavoidable uncertainty and fluctuation, depending on the analytical choices preferred. In
studies that sampled people from multiple locations, large between-location heterogeneity could
be seen (e.g. 0-25% across 133 Brazilian cities).25
Inferred IFR
Inferred IFR estimates varied a lot, from 0.00% to 1.63%. Corrected values also varied
extensively, from 0.00% to 1.31%. For 10 locations, more than one IFR estimate was available
and thus IFR from different studies evaluating the same location could be compared. As shown in
figure 1, the IFR estimates tended to be more homogeneous within each location, while they
differed a lot across locations. The sample size-weighted summary was used to generate a single
estimate to represent each location. Data were available for 32 different locations. The median IFR
across all 32 locations was 0.27% (0.24% using the corrected values). Most data came from
locations with high death tolls and 23 of the 32 locations had a population mortality rate (deaths
per million population) higher than the global average (73 deaths per million population as of July
12) (Figure 2). The uncorrected IFR estimates had a range of 0.01-0.16% (median 0.13%) across

the 9 locations with population mortality rate below the global average, 0.07-0.73% (median
0.27%) across the 15 locations with population mortality rate above the global average but below
500 deaths per million population, and 0.59-1.63% (median 1.12%) across the 8 extreme hotbed
locations with over 500 deaths per million population. The corrected IFR estimates had medians
of 0.10%, 0.25%, and 0.90%, respectively, for the three groups of locations.
The proportion of COVID-19 deaths that occurred in people <70 years old varied
substantially across locations. All deaths in Gangelt were in elderly people while in Wuhan half
the deaths occurred in people <70 years old and the proportion might have been higher in Iran, but
no data could be retrieved for this country. When limited to people <70 years old, IFR ranged
from 0.00% to 0.57% with median of 0.05% (corrected, 0.00-0.46% with median of 0.04%). IFR
estimates in people <70 years old were lower than 0.1% in all but 7 locations that were hard-hit
hotbeds (Belgium, Wuhan, Italy, Spain, Connecticut, Louisiana, New York).
DISCUSSION
IFR is not a fixed physical constant and it can vary substantially across locations,
depending on the population structure, the case-mix of infected and deceased individuals and
other, local factors. Inferred IFR values based on emerging seroprevalence studies typically show
a much lower fatality than initially speculated in the earlier days of the pandemic.
The studies analyzed here represent 50 different estimates of IFR, but they are not fully
representative of all countries and locations around the world. Most of them come from locations
with overall COVID-19 mortality rates exceeding the global average (73 deaths per million people
as of July 12). The median inferred IFR in locations with COVID-19 mortality rate below the
global average is low (0.13%, corrected 0.10%). For hotbed countries with COVID-19 mortality
rates above the global average but lower than 500 deaths per million, the median IFR is still not
that high (median 0.27%, corrected 0.25%). Very high IFR estimates have been documented

practically in locations that had devastating experiences with COVID-19. Such epicenters are
unusual across the globe, but they are overrepresented in the 50 seroprevalence estimates available
for this analysis. Therefore, if one could sample equally from all countries and locations around
the globe, the median IFR might be even lower than the one observed in the current analysis.
Several studies in hard-hit European countries inferred modestly high IFR estimates for the
overall population, but the IFR was still low in people <70 years old. Some of these studies were
on blood donors and may have underestimated seroprevalence and overestimated IFR. One study
in Germany aimed to test the entire population of a city and thus selection bias is minimal:
Gangelt16 represents a situation with a superspreader event (in a local carnival) and 7 deaths were
recorded, all of them in very elderly individuals (average age 81, sd 3.5). COVID-19 has a very
steep age gradient of death risk.51 It is expected therefore that in locations where the infection
finds its way into killing predominantly elderly citizens, the overall, age-unadjusted IFR would be
higher. However, IFR would still be very low in people <70 in these locations, e.g. in Gangelt IFR
is 0.00% in non-elderly people. Similarly, in Switzerland, 69% of deaths occurred in people >80
years old51 and this explains the relatively high overall IFR in Geneva and Zurich. Similar to
Germany, very few deaths in Switzerland have been recorded in non-elderly people, e.g. only
2.5% have occurred in people <60 years old and IFR in that age-group would be ~0.01%. The
majority of deaths in most of the hard hit European countries have happened in nursing homes52
and a large proportion of deaths also in the US53 also follow this pattern. Moreover, many nursing
home deaths have no laboratory confirmation and thus should be seen with extra caution in terms
of the causal impact of SARS-CoV-2.
Locations with high burdens of nursing home deaths may have high IFR estimates, but the
IFR would still be very low among non-elderly, non-debilitated people. The average length of stay
in a nursing home is slightly more than 2 years and people who die in nursing homes die in a

median of 5 months54 so many COVID-19 nursing home deaths may have happened in people
with life expectancy of only a few months. This needs to be verified in careful assessments of
COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes with detailed risk profiling of fatalities. If COVID-19
happened in patients with very limited life expectancy, this pattern may even create a dent of less
than expected mortality in the next 3-6 months after the coronavirus excess mortality wave. As of
July 12 (week 28), preliminary Euromonitor data55 indeed already show a substantial dent below
baseline mortality in France, and a dent below baseline mortality is seen also for the aggregate
European data.
Within China, the much higher IFR estimates in Wuhan versus other areas may reflect the
wide spread of the infection to hospital personnel and the substantial contribution of nosocomial
infections to a higher death toll in Wuhan;56 plus unfamiliarity with how to deal with the infection
in the first location where COVID-19 arose. Massive deaths of elderly individuals in nursing
homes, nosocomial infections, and overwhelmed hospitals may also explain the very high fatality
in specific locations in Italy57 and in New York and neighboring states. Seroprevalence studies in
health care workers and administrative hospital staff in Lombardy58 found 8% seroprevalence in
Milan hospitals and 35-43% in Bergamo hospitals, supporting the scenario for widespread
nosocomial infections among vulnerable patients. The high IFR values in New York metropolitan
area and neighboring states are also not surprising, given the vast death toll witnessed. A very
unfortunate decision of the several state governors was to have COVID-19 patients sent to nursing
homes. Moreover, some hospitals in New York City hotspots reached maximum capacity and
perhaps could not offer optimal care. Use of unnecessarily aggressive management (e.g.
mechanical ventilation) and hydroxychloroquine may also have contributed to worse outcomes.
Furthermore, New York City has an extremely busy, congested public transport system that may
have exposed large segments of the population to high infectious load in close contact

transmission and, thus, perhaps more severe disease. A more aggressive viral clade has also been
speculated, but this needs further verification.59
IFR may reach very high levels among disadvantaged populations and settings that have
the worst combination of factors predisposing to higher fatalities. Importantly, such hotspot
locations are rather uncommon exceptions in the global landscape. Moreover, even in these
locations, the IFR for non-elderly individuals without predisposing conditions may remain very
low. E.g. in New York City only 0.65% of all deaths happened in people <65 years without major
underlying conditions.51 Thus the IFR even in New York City would probably be lower than
0.01% in these people.
Studies with extremely low inferred IFR are also worthwhile discussing. Possible
overestimation of seroprevalence and undercounting of deaths need to be considered. E.g., for
Kobe, the authors of the study11 raise the question whether COVID-19 deaths have been
undercounted in Japan. Both undercounting and overcounting of COVID-19 deaths may be a
caveat in different locations and this is difficult to settle in the absence of very careful scrutiny of
medical records and autopsies. The Tokyo data,29 nevertheless, also show similarly very low IFR.
Moreover, evaluation of all-cause mortality in Japan has shown no excess deaths during the
pandemic, consistent with the possibility that somehow the Japanese population was spared. Very
low IFRs seem common in Asian countries, including China (excluding Wuhan), Iran, Israel and
India. Former immunity from exposure to other coronaviruses, genetic differences, hygienic
etiquette, lower infectious load, and other unknown factors may be speculated. IFR seems to be
very low also in Singapore where extensive PCR testing was carried out. As of July 12, 2020, in
Singapore there were only 26 deaths among 46,283 cases, suggesting an upper bound of 0.06% for
IFR, even if no cases had been missed.

Some surveys have also been designed to assess seroprevalence repeatedly spacing out
measurements in the same population over time. A typical pattern that seems to emerge is that
seroprevalence may increase several fold within a few weeks, but plateau or even decline may
follow.10,28 A more prominent decline of seropositivity was seen in a study in Wuhan.32 Genuine
decrease may be difficult to differentiate from random variation. However, some preliminary
data60,61 suggest that decrease in antibody titers may be fast. Decrease in seropositivity over time
means that the numbers of infected people may be underestimated and IFR overestimated.
The only data from a low-income country among the 23 studies examined here come from
Iran8 and India49 and the IFR estimates appears to be very low. Iran has a young population with
only slightly over 1% of the age pyramid at age >80 and India’s population is even younger.
Similar considerations apply to almost every less developed country around the world. Given the
very sharp age gradient and the sparing of children and young adults from death by COVID-19,
one may expect IFR to be fairly low in the less developed countries. However, it remains to be
seen whether comorbidities, poverty and frailty (e.g. malnutrition) and congested urban living
circumstances may have adverse impact on risk and thus increase IFR also in these countries.
One should caution that the extent of validation of the antibody assays against positive and
negative controls differs across studies. Specificity has typically exceeded 99.0%, which is
reassuring. However, for very low prevalence rates, even 99% specificity may be problematic.
Sensitivity also varies from 60-100% in different validation exercises and for different tests, but
typically it is closer to the upper than the lower bound. One caveat about sensitivity is that
typically the positive controls are patients who had symptoms and thus were tested and found to
be PCR-positive. However, it is possible that symptomatic patients may be more likely to develop
antibodies than patients who are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms and thus had not
sought PCR testing.61-65 For example, one study found that 40% of asymptomatic patients became

seronegative within 8 weeks.61 Since the seroprevalence studies specifically try to unearth these
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic missed infections, a lower sensitivity for these mild infections
could translate to substantial underestimates of the number of infected people and substantial
overestimate of the inferred IFR.
The corrected IFR estimates are trying to account for undercounting of infected people
when not all 3 antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) are assessed.7 However, the magnitude of the
correction is uncertain and may also vary in different circumstances. Moreover, it is possible that
an unknown proportion of people may have handled the virus using immune mechanisms
(mucosal, innate, cellular) that did not generate any serum antibodies.66-69 This may lead to
substantial underestimation of the frequency of infection and respective overestimation of the IFR.
One study has found indeed that mild SARS-CoV-2 infections may lead to nasal release of IgA,
without serum antibody response.68 Another study has found that 6 of 8 interfamilial contacts of
index cases remained seronegative despite developing symptoms and 6 of 8 developed persisting
T cell responses69 and the important role of cellular immune responses even in seronegative
patients has been documented also by other investigators.70
An interesting observation is that even under congested circumstances, like cruise ships,
aircraft carriers or homeless shelter, the proportion of people detected positive typically does not
get to exceed 20-45%.71,72 Similarly, at a wider population level, values ~47% are the maximum
values documented to-date and most values are much lower, yet epidemic waves seem to wane. It
has been suggested73,74 that differences in host susceptibility and behavior can result in herd
immunity at much lower prevalence of infection in the population than originally expected.
COVID-19 spreads by infecting certain groups more than others because some people have much
higher likelihood of exposure. People most likely to be exposed also tend to be those most likely
to spread for the same reasons that put them at high exposure risk. In the absence of random

mixing of people, the epidemic wave may be extinguished even with relatively low proportions of
people becoming infected. Seasonality may also play a role in the dissipation of the epidemic
wave. It has also been observed that many people have CD4 cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2
even without being exposed to this virus, perhaps due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses.75 It
is unknown whether this proportion varies in different populations around the world and whether
this immunity may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves waning without infecting a large
share of the population.
A major limitation of the current analysis is that the calculations presented in this paper
include several studies that have not yet been fully peer-reviewed. Moreover, there are several
studies that are still ongoing. New emerging data may offer more insights and updated estimates.
Given that the large majority of studies have been done in locations that were hard hit from
COVID-19, it would be useful to do more studies in less hit locations, so as to have a more
balanced global perspective.
A comparison of COVID-19 to influenza is often attempted, but many are confused by this
comparison unless placed in context. Based on the IFR estimates obtained here, COVID-19 may
have infected as of July 12 approximately 300 million people (or more), far more than the ~13
million PCR-documented cases. The global COVID-19 death toll is still evolving, but it is still not
much dissimilar to a typical death toll from seasonal influenza (290,000-650,000),76 while “bad”
influenza years (e.g. 1957-9 and 1968-70) have been associated with 1-4 million deaths.77
Notably, influenza devastates low-income countries, but is more tolerant of wealthy nations,
probably because of the availability and wider use of vaccination in these countries.58 Conversely,
in the absence of vaccine and with a clear preference for elderly debilitated individuals, COVID19 may have an inverse death toll profile, with more deaths in wealthy nations than in low-income
countries. However, even in the wealthy nations, COVID-19 seems to affect predominantly the

frail, the disadvantaged, and the marginalized – as shown by high rates of infectious burden in
nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, meat processing plants, and the strong racial/ethnic
inequalities against minorities in terms of the cumulative death risk.78,79
While COVID-19 is a formidable threat, the fact that its IFR is typically much lower than
originally feared, is a welcome piece of evidence. The median IFR found in this analysis is very
similar to the estimate recently adopted by CDC for planning purposes.80 The fact that IFR can
vary substantially also based on case-mix and settings involved also creates additional ground for
evidence-based, more precise management strategies. Decision-makers can use measures that will
try to avert having this lethal virus infect people and settings who are at high risk of severe
outcomes. These measures may be possible to be more precise and tailored to specific high-risk
individuals and settings than blind lockdown of the entire society. Of course, uncertainty remains
about the future evolution of the pandemic, e.g. the presence and height of subsequent waves.81
However, it is helpful to know that SARS-CoV-2 has relatively modest IFR overall and that
possibly IFR can be made even lower with appropriate, precise non-pharmacological choices.

*The authors of some studies preferred to focus on age-restricted populations: 17-70 years old in the
Denmark blood donor study (n=3800000), those 18-79 years old in the Luxembourg study (n=483000);
those <70 years old in Netherlands blood donor study (n=13745768); those >=18 years old in the New
York state study (n=15280000); and those >19 years old in the UT population of the six states US study
(n=2173082).
**considered positive if both IgG and IgA were positive
***participants were recruited from a large number of districts, but most districts had very few participants;
here the population of the 9 districts with >1:10,000 sampling ratio is included (846/1000 participants came
from these 9 districts).

Among studies with multiple consecutive time points where seroprevalence was evaluated, the
seroprevalence estimate was the highest in the most recent time interval with the exception of Switzerland
(Geneva) where the highest value was seen two weeks before the last time interval, Switzerland (Zurich)
where the highest was seen in April 1-15 for patients at the university hospital and in May for blood
donors, and the China (Wuhan B) study where the highest value was seen about 3 weeks before the last
time interval.
*an estimate is also provided adjusting for test performance, but the assumed specificity of 99.0% seems
inappropriate, since as part of the validation process the authors also found that several of the test-positive
individuals had household members who were also infected, thus the estimated specificity was deemed to
be at least 99.95%

**the authors calculate 760000 infected in the 90 cities that had 200-250 samples tested, but many of the

districts with key enrollment in the study among all Hesse province deaths.
**data are provided by the authors for deaths per 100,000 population in each city along with inferred IFR
in each city, with wide differences across cities; the IFR shown here is the median across the 36 cities with
200-250 samples and at least one positive sample (the interquartile range for the uncorrected IFR is 0.200.60 and the full range across all cities is 0-2.4%, but with very wide uncertainty in each city). A higher
IFR is alluded in the preprint, but the preprint also shows a scatter diagram for survey-based seroprevalence
versus reported deaths per population with a regression slope that agrees with IFR of 0.3.
*** whenever the number/proportion of COVID-19 deaths at age <70 years was not provided in the paper,
the proportion of these deaths was retrieved from situational reports of the relevant location; when this was
not possible to find for the specific location, a larger geographic entity was used. For Brazil, the closest
information that could be found was from a news report
(https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/05/22/in-brazil-covid-19-hitting-young-people-harder.html).
For Croatia, data on age for 45/103 deaths were retrieved through Wikipedia.

retrieve what the number of deaths was as of mid-May, but even using data for death rates across all Sao
Paulo would lead to IFR >0.4 overall. In the Vitacura study, similarly one can infer from the wider
Santiago Metropolitan area that in the Vitacura area the IFR would probably be <0.2 overall.
^Confirmed deaths; inclusion of probable deaths would increase the IFR estimates by about a quarter.
#for France, governmental situational reports provide per region the number of deaths only for in-hospital
deaths, therefore the number of in-hospital deaths has been multiplied by a factor equal to the total
deaths/in-hospital deaths across France.
IFR: infection fatality rate. The inferred IFR is derived by dividing the number of accumulated deaths (at
the time chosen by the authors of each study, or until after 1 week of the mid-point of the study dates,
whenever the authors had not arbitrated on a date for the death count) by the estimated number of infected
people. The corrected IFR is obtained from the inferred IFR assuming that, as compared with assessing
IgG, IgM, and IgA, 20% of the infections are missed when only IgG is assessed, and 10% of the infections
are missed when two of the three antibodies are assessed.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Locations that had two or more IFR estimates from different studies. Locations
are defined at the level of countries, except for the USA where they are defined at the level
of states and China is separated into Wuhan and non-Wuhan areas. Corrected IFR
estimates are shown. Within the same location, IFR estimates tend to have only modest
differences, even though it is possible that different areas within the same location may
also have genuinely different IFR. France is one exception where differences are large, but
both estimates come from population studies of outbreaks from schools and thus may not
provide good estimates of population seroprevalence and may lead to underestimated IFR.
Figure 2. Scatterplot of corrected IFR estimates (%) in each location plotted against the
COVID-19 mortality rate as of July 12, 2020 in that location (in deaths per million
population). Locations are defined at the level of countries, except for the USA where they
are defined at the level of states and China is separated into Wuhan and non-Wuhan areas.
When several IFR estimates are available from multiple studies for a location, the sample
size-weighted mean has been used. Not shown are two locations with >1000 deaths per
million population, both of which have high IFR (New York and Connecticut).
