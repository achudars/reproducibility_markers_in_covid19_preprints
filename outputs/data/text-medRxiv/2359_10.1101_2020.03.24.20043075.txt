Abstract
Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic has raised international concern.
Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed
to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with
COVID-19.
Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We
assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at
admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated
with symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of
anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was
correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p<0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360，p<0.05) symptoms

among patients with COVID-19. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender
(β=1.446, p=0.034), age (β=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation (β =-2.140, p=0.049), and social
support (β =-1.545, p=0.017) were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, age
(β=0.084, p=0.001), family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (β =1.515, p=0.027) and social support (β
=-2.236, p＜0.001) were the factors associated with depression.
Conclusion: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presented features of anxiety and depression.
Mental concern and appropriate intervention are essential parts of clinical care for those who are at
risk.

Introduction
Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has widely and rapidly spread in China
and around the world 1. As of March 18, 2020, more than 180,000 confirmed cases and at least 7500
death have been reported in 159 countries (territories/areas), according to the World Health
Organization (WHO)2. The grim epidemic has caused increasing public panic and mental health
stress. Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored, while trying to control the
outbreak.

Previous studies have shown that depression and anxiety are common and persistent mental illness
in various chronic diseases3, 4, cancer5 and other serious illness. And these studies indicated that
patients with mental illness, including depression and anxiety may have difficulty with symptom
control, and have impaired quality of life. However, recently-published researches on psychological
impact of COVID-19 are mainly focus on the healthcare workers6, 7 and general public8, who were
worried about the risks of infection and protective measures, resulting in psychological distress.

Mental health of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 during the epidemic remains unknown.
Considering that patients after diagnosis of COVID-19 were more likely to have psychological
concerns such as fear of progression of their illness, disability, or premature death. It is vital to
investigate the prevalence and related factors of anxiety and depression in patients infected with
COVID-19.

In the present study, we aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression
in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This study may draw more attention to the psychological
state of patients with COVID-19, and assist doctors to provide more appropriate treatment and
psychological interventions to improve mental and physical health of patients during the campaign
to contain and eradicate COVID-19.

Methods
Participants
This descriptive quantitative cross-sectional study included 144 patients with confirmed COVID19 who were admitted from 23 February 2020 to 13 March 2020 in Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan,
China) during the COVID-19 epidemic. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to
World Health Organization interim guidance. Informed consent was provided by subjects before
study commencement. All participants completed the questionnaires through an online survey
platform (‘SurveyStar’, Changsha Ranxing Science and Technology, Shanghai, China) at admission.
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Huoshenshan Hospital.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
The HADS is a self-assessment questionnaire designed to detect anxiety and depression symptoms
in general hospital patients. It has been acknowledged that the Chinese version of the HADS had
good internal consistency and favorable scale equivalence9. The degree of anxiety and depression
is rated by the accumulated scores: score 0-7, indicating no anxiety or depression; score 8-10,
indicating mild levels of anxiety or depression; score 11-14, indicating moderate and score 15-21,
indicating severe levels of anxiety or depression.

Perceived Social Support Scale
The 12‐item Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) were translated into Chinese and has been
widely adopted to measures perceived support from family, friends and other ways in Chinese
population10. Total scores range from 0 to 84, with higher scores implying greater level of perceived
social support.

Statistical Analysis
SPSS software, version 19 were used for statistical analysis. Means and proportions of the given
data for each variable were calculated. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Pearson’s chisquare test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were analyzed using non-paired Student t
test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to
identify factors associated with depression and anxiety. Differences between groups were
considered to be significant when the P-value was < 0.05.

Results
Demographic characteristics
A total of 144 participants, including 70 male and 74 female were included in current study. The age
of the study participants ranged from 15 to 87 years. Their average age was 49.98±13.73 years.
Participants were mostly living with a spouse (121/144, 84%). About a third of the subjects (54/144,
37.5%) were well educated (≥ bachelor’s degree), and only 4 of 144 participants (2.8%) had primary
education. Oxygen saturation is a key clinical index for evaluation the severity of patients with
COVID-19. In the present study, 11.1% participants whose oxygen saturation was less than or equal
to 93% at rest, were with severe disease. Considering that other family members’ infection may
cause emotional distress to the participants, we also collected the infection status of family members.
59 participants (41%) had one or more family members infected. Demographic characteristics are
listed in Table 1.

Psychosocial characteristics of the participants with COVID-19
The mean score of anxiety subscale and depression subscale for all patients was 6.35±4.29 and 5.44
± 4.32, respectively. With the reference to HADS, 50 (34.72%) and 31 (28.47%) participants

presented symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Regarding the patients’ anxiety levels,
it was found that 17.36%, 12.5% and 4.86% appeared to have mild, moderate and severe anxiety,
respectively. As for the depression levels of patients, 20 were mildly depressed (13.89%), 15 were
moderately depressed (10.42%), and 6 were severely depressed (4.17%).

Correlations among depression, anxiety and social support in COVID-19 patients
Since there is a large body of evidence that social support plays a beneficial role in mental health11.
Self‐reported levels of social support were assessed among the patients with COVID-19. The mean
social support score for all participants was 63.41±11.99. The average score of family, friends and
other support was 22.35±4.42, 20.53±4.60 and 20.52±4.55, respectively. More than half of the
participants (90/144, 62.5%) exhibited high level of perceived social support.

The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=0.196, p<0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360，p<0.05) symptoms (Table 2). In detail, friend support (r
= -0.165, p < 0.05) and other support (r=-0.230, p < 0.05) were significantly negative correlated
with anxiety. In addition, family support (r=-0.283, p < 0.05), friend support (r=-0.307, p < 0.05)
and other support (r=-0.363, p < 0.05) were significantly negative correlated with depression.

Factors associated with depression and anxiety among patients with COVID-19
In order to investigate the factors related to depression and anxiety among patients with COVID-19,
anxiety and depression scores were compared between different groups. As shown in Table 3,
anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher in those who are older (age＞50) and loweducated. Additionally, patients with lower oxygen saturation had higher anxiety score, and those
getting less social support had higher depression scores.

The multiple linear regression analysis (Table 4) showed that gender (β=1.446, p=0.034), age
(β=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation (β =-2.140, p=0.049), and social support (β =-1.545, p=0.017)
were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. It suggested that female, and patients who are
older, with lower oxygen saturation and less social support would tend to present anxiety symptoms.
Moreover, age (β=0.084, p=0.001), family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (β =1.515, p=0.027) and

social support (β =-2.236, p＜0.001) were the factors associated with depression. The results
indicated that patients with older age, family member infection and less social support were more
likely to be depressive (table 4).

Discussion
A number of studies have interlinked the depression and anxiety to patients with different disease35

. This study first reported the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19

during the epidemic. The results of the present study showed that 34.72% and 28.47% patients with
COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively.

In the present study, it is worthy of note that social support is one of the key factors linked to anxiety
and depression for patients with COVID-19 (Table 4). As the results displayed that less social
support was correlated with more anxious and depressive symptoms (Table 2). Mounts of studies
have demonstrated that in the case of disease, patients need more social support, which included
physical and psychological assistance provided by family members, friends, medical workers, and
relevant institutions to cope with difficulty11. There is consistent evidence which showed that social
isolation and loneliness were linked to worse mental health outcomes12. While during the COVID19 epidemic, many isolated patients often felt helpless and lonely due to the lack of family or friends
accompany. In the circumstances, medical workers as the major peer support that is of great
significance to infected patients. In clinical practice, Chinese medical members would keep in touch
with patients and try various psychological support methods to help isolated patients rebuild
confidence. In some Wuhan makeshift hospitals, patients with mild symptoms did Tai Chi practice
(which has been verified as an effective way to improve lung function for COPD patients13), singing
and dancing as physical relax, accompanied and guided by medical staff. This kind of doctor-patient
interaction may encourage patients to stay positive mindset.

Furthermore, older age and lower oxygen saturation are the other factors should be considered for
patients to be anxious. As previous research revealed that older patients are at increased risk with
severe COVID-19 symptoms and death 14. Additionally, oxygen saturation is a key index to evaluate
the severity of patients with COVID-19. According to the Chinese management guideline for

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043075; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19 (version 6.0)15, patients whose oxygen saturation was≤93% at rest was defined as
severe type patients. In this study, 11.1% participants were with low oxygen saturation. These results
indicated that patients with severe illness are more likely to be anxious. More psychological care
and health attention needs to be given to these critically ill patients.

Consistent with previous report, which is focus on the psychological responses among general
population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China8, females patients are also prone to developing
higher levels of anxiety as shown in the current study. Meanwhile, education background is another
associated factor to the mental distress among infected patients. And as we expected, family member
infection is another factor affecting patients to be depressed. High levels of concern about other
family members and lack of family care may magnify pessimism over the illness.

Given that anxiety and depression are related with longer hospitalization3, 16 and non-adherence to
treatment17, 18 in several diseases. Early prevention of mental health problems is of vital importance
to help patients have good clinical outcomes and better life quality. As the COVID-19 epidemic
continues to spread, our ﬁndings is particularly instructive to develop a psychological support
strategy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China and other areas aﬀected by the epidemic.

Study Limitation
1) The present study was single-centered, the study sample was not representative of all patients
with COVID-19 in China, which limits the generalizability of the results. 2) We only collected data
at admission. Thus, it did not allow for investigation the inferences or changes over time. 3) This
cross-sectional study is not capable to determine a causal relationship between mental health
(anxiety or depression) and the sociodemographic and clinical variables.

Conclusion
Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced features of anxiety and depression. The
significant factors found in the present study may draw medical workers paying more attention to
the mental health of patients with COVID-19, and psychological care and timely intervention are
needed for patients during the epidemic.
