ABSTRACT

Background: The efficacy and safety profile of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been definitively established in immunocompromised patient
populations. Patients with a known cancer diagnosis were hitherto excluded from trials of the vaccines
currently in clinical use.
Methods: This study presents data on the safety and immune efficacy of the BNT162b2 (PfizerBioNTech) vaccine in 54 healthy controls and 151 mostly elderly patients with solid and
haematological malignancies, respectively, and compares results for patients who were boosted with
BNT162b2 at 3 weeks versus those who were not. Immune efficacy was measured as antibody
seroconversion, T cell responses, and neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and of a variant of
concern (VOC) (B.1.1.7). We also collected safety data for the BNT162b2 vaccine up to 5 weeks
following first dose.
Findings: The vaccine was largely well tolerated. However, in contrast to its very high performance
in healthy controls (>90% efficacious), immune efficacy of a single inoculum in solid cancer patients
was strikingly low (below 40%) and very low in haematological cancer patients (below 15%). Of
note, efficacy in solid cancer patients was greatly and rapidly increased by boosting at 21-days (95%
within 2 weeks of boost). Too few haematological cancer patients were boosted for clear conclusions
to be drawn.
Conclusions: Delayed boosting potentially leaves most solid and haematological cancer patients
wholly or partially unprotected, with implications for their own health; their environment and the
evolution of VOC strains. Prompt boosting of solid cancer patients quickly overcomes the poor
efficacy of the primary inoculum in solid cancer patients.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
Some cancer patients have been shown to exhibit sustained immune dysregulation, inefficient
seroconversion and prolonged viral shedding as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Consequently, their exclusion and, in particular, the exclusion of
patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapies, from the registry trials of the 5 approved COVID-19
vaccines raises questions about the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in this patient
population. In addition, whilst the change in the UK’s dosing interval to 12-weeks aimed to maximise
population coverage, it is unclear whether this strategy is appropriate for cancer patients and those on
systemic anti-cancer therapies.
Added value of this study
We report that the RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine administered in cancer patients was well
tolerated, and we provide first insights into both antibody and T cell responses to the vaccine in an
immunocompromised patient population.
Implications of all the available evidence
In cancer patients, one dose of 30ug of BNT162b2 yields poor vaccine efficacy, as measured by
seroconversion rates, viral neutralisation capacity and T cell responses, at 3- and 5-weeks following the
first inoculum. Patients with solid cancers exhibited a significantly greater response following a booster at
21-days. These data support prioritisation of cancer patients for an early (21-day) second dose of the
BNT162b2 vaccine. Given the globally poor responses to vaccination in patients with haematological
cancers, post-vaccination serological testing, creation of herd immunity around these patients using a
strategy of ‘ring vaccination’, and careful follow-up should be prioritised.

Introduction
There has been much concern about the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) exposure on groups considered at high risk of developing COVID-19, including those who
suffer from cancer, many of whom are elderly, and in whom immunocompetence may be jeopardised by
the malignancy and/or its treatment.1–3 Public health measures such as the use of masks, social distancing,
test and trace programmes have helped limit virus transmission but have been insufficient to curb the
pandemic.4–7 Thus, there was an urgent need for safe and effective prophylactic vaccines. On the 2nd
December 2020, COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 produced by Pfizer-BioNTech was authorised by
Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK for active immunisation to
prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older
(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-authorises-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine).
The
active
substance of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)– nucleosidemodified mRNA vaccine encoding full-length, uncleaved and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike.8
The phase 3 trial for the BNT162b2 vaccine given at Day-1 followed by Day-21 booster resulted in a 95%
efficacy at preventing COVID-19 illness, including severe disease.8 Of the 18,860 individuals immunized
with the vaccine, none with an active oncological diagnosis was included. Exclusion criteria for the trial
included a medical history of COVID-19, treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, or diagnosis with an
immunocompromising condition. On 30th December 2020, the UK announced that the second doses of the
COVID-19 vaccines should be given towards the end of 12 weeks rather than in the previously
recommended 3-4 weeks for all vaccinee groups. A subsequent note of caution about possible low
vaccine response in immunosuppressed patients appeared in the UK government Green Book published in
12th February 2021; recommending where possible to schedule the 2nd dose earlier.9
We recently published10 that for some cancer patients, especially those with B cell malignancies, SARSCoV-2 infection may result in delayed or negligible seroconversion, prolonged shedding, and sustained
immune-dysregulation, as compared to the general population11. Likewise, some data report the
suboptimal vaccine efficacy in older12 and in immunocompromised populations13–15, both of which
descriptors may apply to cancer patients prioritised for early vaccination. The prospect that cancer patients
might be wholly or partially unprotected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has implications for their individual
health and for the control of virus transmission local to their environments that can include frequent visits
to health-care facilities.10,16,17 In relation to these issues, we established the SOAP-02 vaccine study (SarsCoV-2 fOr cAncer Patients) aimed to answer: 1) the safety and efficacy of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine
in cancer patients; and 2) whether or not there was a profound impact for cancer patients of boosting at
day-21 post initial vaccination.
METHODS
Trial design, objectives and participants
We conducted a prospective longitudinal cohort study of cancer patients and healthy controls (HC), most
of whom were health care workers between December 8th, 2020, and February 18th, 2021. Patients with a
known diagnosis of cancer presenting at Guy’s & St Thomas’ Trust Hospital, King’s College Hospital or
Princess Royal University Hospital, who were eligible for the COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine were
screened and approached for informed consented into the SOAP-study. To facilitate cross-study
comparisons we included a cohort of vaccinated HC as internal experimental controls for inter-study
variability. The trial was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions
(IRAS ID: 282337 REC ID: 20/HRA/2031). Blood samples were captured at: pre-vaccination (time-point
1 (TP1)), at week 3 after first vaccine dose (timepoint 2 (TP2)), at week 5 after first vaccine dose (timepoint 3 (TP3)). Follow-up is planned for further blood sampling after the delayed vaccine boost. Where
possible serial nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR swab-tests were performed every 10-days or in
cases of symptomatic COVID-19 (Figure 1A). The interim results of safety and efficacy for 205
participants up to 5-weeks following the first vaccination dose are reported here. Participants vaccinated
between December 8 th to December 29th received two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2, administered
intramuscularly 21 days apart; but in line with changes in the national government guidelines, patients

vaccinated after this date received only one dose within the study period with a planned follow up booster
at 12-weeks.
Trial end-points
The primary end-point was the humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in cancer
patients following the first injection of the COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 Vaccine. The secondary endpoint of the study was the safety following each vaccine dose. Telephone consultations to evaluate
reactogenicity and safety were scheduled weekly where possible. Adverse events were graded according to
the following scale: mild, does not interfere with activity; moderate, interferes with activity; severe,
prevents daily activity; and grade 4, emergency department visit or hospitalization. Safety data are
included up to the cut-off date of February 18th, 2021.
Laboratory analyses
The laboratory analyses performed on blood samples received are detailed in supplementary materials.
Statistical analysis
Statistics were computed in R using statistical tests outlined in the figure legends. Briefly, patients between
cancer groups were compared with a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test. Analysis of virus
neutralization and patient trajectories following boosting was conducted with a paired Wilcoxon test.
Immune cell counts between responder groups were compared with a Wilcoxon test. Correlations were
analysed by Spearman’s test. Where appropriate, p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg
correction to reflect multiple comparisons. Chi-squared tests were used to assess the association of
serological response with cancer status.
Role of funding source
The academic authors retained editorial control. All various funders of the study had no role in the study
design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

RESULTS
Participants
From December 8th, 2020 until February 18th, 2021, 151 cancer patients and 54 HC consented to enrolment
into the SOAP-vaccine study. Of the cancer patients, 31 cancer patients were vaccinated with BNT162b2
on days 1 and 21; and 118 primed have a planned second dose boost at around 12-weeks (Figure 1B). Of
the 54 HC, 16 received vaccinations 21-days apart; and 38 primed are planned for a delayed 12-week
boost. Analysis of samples and data obtained after February 18th, 2021 are ongoing.
The clinical characteristics of trial participants are provided (Table 1). Among cancer patients, 52% were
male, 82% were white, and 64% had at least one other coexisting comorbidity. The median age was 73
years, and 75% of the participants were older than 65 years of age. Of the 151 cancer patients, 63%
(95/151) represented a diversity of solid malignancies and 37% (56/151) presented with haematological
malignancies (Table 1). Most solid cancer patients had late-stage disease (80%) and with a cancer
diagnosis for >24months. The HC cohort comprised vaccine-eligible individuals, primarily health care
workers, that did not compose an age-matched control cohort for the cancer patients, but facilitated
comparison of vaccine efficacy and safety in our study with results of other studies of BTN162b2.8,18,19
The distribution of the anti-cancer treatments given in relation to the date of vaccine administrations for
solid and haematological cancers is shown in Table 2. For solid cancers, 41.3% (38/92) of the patients had
had an anti-cancer treatment within 15-days prior to the 1st dose of the vaccine. Of these 38 patients, 19

had had chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) or both. 54% (50/92) went on to have anticancer treatment within 15-days after administration of the first dose of the vaccine; with 50% (25/47)
receiving chemotherapy, CPI or both in this timeframe. Of the 25 solid cancer patients who received the
second day-21 boost, 9 (36%) had received anti-cancer treatment in the preceding 15 days; and 15 (60%)
went on to have treatment in the following 15 days (Table 2). For haematological cancers, 47% (26/55) of
the patients had had an anti-cancer treatment within 15-days prior to the first dose of the vaccine. Of these
26 patients, 50% had received combination therapies of either chemotherapy or targeted therapies, all with
the addition of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and 31% received targeted therapies alone. The mAb
therapies were anti-CD20, anti-CD30 or anti-CD38. Targeted therapies consisted of Bruton tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (BTKi), Bcl-2 inhibitor (Bcl2i) or bortezomib. 49% (27/55) received anti-cancer treatment within
15-days after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine; with 41% (11/27) receiving combination
therapies in this timeframe. 8 patients were on a BTKi within 15-days before and after the vaccine
administration. Only 6 haematological cancer patients received the second day-21 booster, with 2 on a
BTKi at the time of vaccine administration (Table 2). Blood analyses following the second day-21 booster
were conducted on 5 of these 6 patients (see below).
Safety and tolerability
RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine well tolerated in cancer patients
Toxicity data was available for 180 and 47 participants following the first inoculum and the second day-21
boost, respectively. 54.3% cancer and 37.5% of HC BNT162b2 recipients, reported no toxicity following
the first inoculum (Figure 2Ai,ii). However, following the second day-21 boost, 71.0% of cancer patients
reported no toxicity as compared to 31.25% of HC (Figure 2Aiii,iv). Additionally, only 6.8% of cancer
patients reported local and systemic effects as compared to 50% of HC following the day-21 boost (Figure
2Aiii,iv). One cancer patient previously prescribed immune checkpoint inhibitors presented with deranged
liver function tests requiring hospital admission 3 weeks following the first inoculum (grade 4); the cause
remains unclear at this time. Routine clinical laboratory values or laboratory abnormalities observed on all
other participants after BNT162b2 vaccinations at the study time-points did not demonstrate any
significant findings (Supplementary Table 1). Pain at the injection site within 7 days after injection of the
first dose of the vaccine was the most commonly reported local reaction (Figure 2Bi,ii). We document a
noticeably lower incidence of participants reporting moderate symptoms in the cancer cohort as compared
to the HCs following the first dose and second dose of the vaccine (Figure 2B,C). No differences in safety
profiles between haematological and solid cancer patients were observed. Safety monitoring will continue
for 18months after administration of the second dose of vaccine.
Efficacy
Poor efficacy of a priming vaccine inoculum in cancer patients
In assessing the immuno-efficacy of BNT162b2, it was clearly essential to exclude individuals whose
immune systems may have been stimulated by past or concurrent infection. Hence, to test for
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections following vaccination, cancer patient participants were asked to
provide nose and throat swabs, ideally every 10-days. However, given the high prevalence of the B.1.1.7
(Kent) variant in the UK20, coupled with a national lockdown announced on January 4th 2021
(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-announces-national-lockdown), only 79 patients
from the study were able to attend for screening for the whole study period, of whom only twelve had
more than one swab performed. Up until day-21 post-first vaccine inoculum, six positive cases were
observed (Figure Supp 1A,B): two developed severe COVID-19 and succumbed to the disease, one prior
to TP2 sampling; four experienced asymptomatic/mild disease, of whom two continued to swab positive
at day 28 and day 36. Conversely, no new positive swab tests were recorded after 21 days post-first
vaccine inoculum (Figure Supp 1A). For the reasons considered above, the 4 surviving swab-test-positive
individuals were excluded from the main cohort analysis of vaccine efficacy, but are reconsidered later in
this manuscript.
Antibody seroconversion was the primary assay for vaccine efficacy. As described21, we deployed an
ELISA test to measure IgG antibodies specific for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that was included in the

vaccine. The test was validated for batch effects using standard positive and negative controls, in relation
to which the threshold for a positive score was set at 70 EC50 dilution units (Figure Supp 1C). Baseline
scores of >70 provided an additional means to identify individuals experiencing past or concurrent SARSCoV-2 exposure, whose classification was further aided by our use of an ELISA assay for baseline and/or
developing IgG reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 N protein that was not included in the vaccine. This ELISA too
has been described21,22, and was re-validated (Figure Supp 1D). By these combined means, we identified
15 individuals (5 HC; 7 solid cancer patients; 3 haematological cancer patients) as possibly pre-exposed,
two of whom were confirmed by virus swab test (above). Thus, 17 individuals in total were removed from
the cohort analysis of vaccine efficacy but are reconsidered later in this manuscript.
When the remaining individuals were examined for anti-S IgG titres at ~21 days following a single vaccine
inoculum, they revealed significantly different levels of vaccine efficacy across the three cohorts (Table 3):
thus, ~97% (31/32) HCs were “responders” (R), whereas only ~39% (21/54) of solid cancer patients were
responders (p<0.0001), and only ~13% (5/39) of haematological cancer patients (p<0.0001). Amongst the
responders, anti-S IgG titres varied across a >100-fold range in each cohort (Figure 3A), across which the
median titres were comparable in each cohort. In short, the main differences between HC, solid cancer
patients, and haematological cancer patients was in the capacity to make a response rather than the scale of
the response made. The HC cohort was chosen to illustrate the efficiency and scale of seroconversion that
may be achieved, and for that and above mentioned reasons was not designed as a matched, cancer-free
control cohort for the patients who were mostly much older. Nonetheless, the failure to make an overt
response to the first vaccine inoculum did not obviously correlate with age (Figure 3B) and more likely
relates to disease and treatment, as considered later.
To examine the functional impact of seroconversion, we examined serological responders for the capacity
to neutralise infection by either the vaccine matched SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Wuhan strain, referred to as
wild-type (WT), or as England 2020/02/407073, a SARS-CoV-2 strain that was pre-eminent in the UK
during most of 2020), or the SARS-CoV-2 strain B.1.1.7 (Spike variant VOC 202012/01, lineage B.1.1.7)
that rapidly became pre-eminent in the UK following its emergence in late-2020.20 To this end, we
employed a recently described, validated assay21–23, and found that all HC responders (as judged by ID50
dilution; i.e. high values equate to potent neutralisation) had neutralising capacity although the scores were
significantly lower for the B.1.1.7 strain versus England 02/2020/407073 (p=0.001) (Figure 3C; Supp
Figure 1E). Most but not all solid cancer and haematological cancer patient responders also showed
neutralisation capacity: the average ID50 value was comparable across all three cohorts, but the range was
greater in the cancer patients (Figure 3C). When directly cross-compared for responders, there was a very
strong correlation of anti-S IgG titres with neutralisation scores for HC and solid cancer patients, there
being too few haematological cancer patient responders to justify the comparison (Figure 3D).
In sum, a priming inoculum of 30μg of BNT162b2 induced seroconversion in the great majority of HCs,
but failed to achieve this in most solid and haematological cancer patients, with efficacy in the
haematological cancer cohort being significantly worse than in solid cancer patients. Moreover, not all
seroconverted cancer patients showed virus neutralisation. By comparing outcomes with baseline flow
cytometry data, it became clear, unsurprisingly, that non-responder (NR) status correlated significantly
with reduced B cell numbers in solid cancer patients (median value for no-responders = 34,680 cells/ml
versus 87,840 cells/ml for responders) and in haematological cancer patients (median value for nonresponders= 5,040 cells/ml versus 225,020 cells/ml for responders) (Figure 3E). There was likewise a
trend by which NR status correlated with reduced peripheral blood T cell numbers (Figure 3E).
T cell responses to a priming vaccine inoculum
From a subset of individuals in each cohort we subjected PBMC to fluorospot assays to quantitate T cells
secreting IFN-γ and/or IL-2 in response to stimulation with two separate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
peptide pools, one spanning the S2 domain and one spanning the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), which
is not contained within S2.18,24 Peptides within these pools are capable of stimulating both MHCI- and
MHCII-restricted T cell responses.24,25 Additionally, we compared responses to peptides from commonly
encountered viruses, CMV, EBV, and influenza and from tetanus that were contained in two pools, CEFT

and CEF that likewise favoured stimulation of MHCII-restricted and MHCI-restricted T cells, respectively.
The assay was stringently assessed for batch effects by use of a documented positive control and a
validated negative control (Figure Supp 2A,B). A single cut-off for T cell responses was determined by
receiver operated characteristic (ROC) analysis using pooled IFN-γ and IL-2 and responses to RBD and S2
from infection-naïve HC individuals before and 21 days following priming inoculum, establishing a
threshold value of >7 cytokine secreting cells/106 PBMC as a positive response (Figure Supp 2A,B) .
Of HCs assayed, 14 of 17 (82%) showed T cell responses at day-21 post-vaccination, manifesting in IFN-γ
and/or IL-2 production, and many examples of double-producing cells (Figure 4A; Figure Supp 2C; Table
3). These responses correlated with serological responses, as shown by bi-variate analyses, although three
serological responders failed to show T cell reactivity while there was one case of T cell reactivity in a HC
non-responder (Figure 4B). The situation for solid cancer patients was different by two notable and related
criteria. First, 22 of 31 patients (~71%) showed T cell responses (Figure 4A), an efficacy much more
comparable to HC than was true for seroconversion (above). Second, whereas only 1 serological responder
failed to show T cell reactivities, T cell reactivities were evident for 8 serological non-responders (Figure
4B). Although the dynamic range of positive values was broad (from 0 to >300), the median value for
patients was somewhat lower than for HCs (7 versus 25 for S2-IFN-γ reactivity; Figure 4A).
This phenomenon was largely echoed by haematological cancer patients. Thus, of 18 assayed for T cell
reactivities at day-21, 9 (50%) scored positive for IFN-γ and/or IL-2 in response to S2 peptides (Figure 4a).
Although the median value for S2-reactive IFN-γ-secreting cells was comparable to that of solid cancer
patients, the dynamic range was less (from 0 to 37.5; Figure 4A). Importantly, this was not because T cell
response competence per se was compromised in haematological cancer patients because the frequencies
and strengths of CEF+CEFT responses were quantitatively comparable across all cohorts (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, 8 of 9 haematological cancer patients showing T cell responses were serological nonresponders (Figure 4A, B). Moreover, positivity for RBD peptides was rare. Given that RBD-reactivity is
possibly more specific for SARS-CoV-2 than is reactivity to S2, which sequence is highly conserved with
minor variation in common cold coronaviruses, it is possible that seronegative haematological cancer
patients showing low-level T cell reactivities reflect pre-existing T cell reactivities rather than those
induced by the vaccine.
In sum, a priming inoculum of 30μg of BNT162b2 induced T cell responses to S2 and RBD in the majority
of HCs and solid cancer patients, although many of the cancer patients were serological non-responders.
When viewed across all subjects, IFN-γ production in response to S2 or RBD correlated with neutralisation
of England 2020/02/407073 but did not correlate as strongly as anti-Spike IgG (Figure 4C). Moreover, T
cell responses did not correlate significantly with B.1.1.7 neutralisation (Figure 4C).
Primed versus boosted immunity
The next step was to investigate whether the subsequent trajectories of primary responses might be
positively affected by boosting with 30μg of BNT162b2. Thus, the cohorts were divided into two subsets,
boosted or not at day-21, and then were compared at TP3, which was 5 weeks after the priming inoculum
and 14 days after the boost for those who received it. There was some attrition in sampling at TP3 relative
to TP2, particularly for those who were not boosted. Nonetheless, the results were striking by several
criteria. First, 100% (12/12) of boosted HC scored positive (Table 3), including the seroconversion of 1
individual who was formally seronegative (above). Second, 18 of 19 (95%) solid cancer patients scored as
seropositive after boost (Table 3), including the seroconversion of 8 individuals, whereas only 9 of 21
(43%) who were not boosted scored as seropositive (Table 3), comparable to a seropositivity rate of 39%
for solid cancer patients attained at week 3 with priming inoculum alone (above). Third, individual
trajectory plots (Figure 5A) clearly showed that without boosting, TP3 anti-Spike IgG titres remained
mostly comparable to TP2 in HC and in solid cancer patients, with some tendency to decline. Conversely,
the boost substantially increased anti-S IgG titres, significantly in solid cancer patients (p<0.03) (Figure
5A), such that their average was now comparable to that of HCs, notably representing a much younger
cohort.

For haematological cancer patients, it was not possible to assess rigorously the impact of boosting because
only 6 were eligible for the booster before government guidelines mandated a longer delay post priming.
Nonetheless, of those 6 who were boosted, analyses were performed on 5, of whom 3 scored positive
(Table 3). Moreover, of 25 analysed at TP3 without prior boosting, only 2 scored positive and there were
some conspicuous reductions in anti-S IgG titres between TP2 and TP3 (Figure 5A).
For solid cancers, the considerable impact of the boost on anti-S IgG titres was mirrored by profound
increases in the capacity to neutralise both Wuhan strain and B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins assayed
(Figure 5B,C). Boosting likewise increased virus neutralisation by HC sera, and this increase was
particularly evident for B.1.1.7, the current major circulating strain in the UK (Figure 5B,C). Again, few
haematological cancer patients showed neutralisation capacity, and there was considerable heterogeneity
among them with respect to neutralisation potency (Figure 5B,C).
A substantial quantitative impact of boosting was apparent for T cells in HC and cancer patients. Thus, of
3 HCs, 4 haematological cancer patients, and 16 solid cancer patients that were all boosted, only two solid
cancer patients and one haematological cancer patients did not display SARS-CoV-2-peptide reactive IFNγ and/or IL-2 T cell responses (Figure 5D). Moreover, boosting induced the acquisition of T cell responses in
1 haematological cancer patient and 4 solid cancer patients. By contrast, among those HCs and solid cancer
patients who were not boosted, there was acquisition of T cell reactivity at TP3 in only two HCs who
scored negative at TP2 (Table 3), and TP2-existing T cell responses either remained comparable at TP3 or
declined somewhat, e.g. IL-2 and IFN-γ responses to RBD peptides. (Figure 5D). As a control, the values
for CEF and CEFT cell responses remained mostly the same from TP2 to TP3, irrespective of boosting
(Figure 5D). Again, few haematological cancer patients were boosted, but for those who were the potency
of the T cell response was increased (Figure 5D). Nonetheless, there was no case of acquired T cell
reactivity at TP3 among those who were negative at TP2 whether or not they were boosted (Table 3).
In sum, by three weeks following a primary inoculum of BNT162b2, cancer patients in general showed
poor efficacy in terms of seroconversion and virus neutralisation, and over the following two weeks, there
was essentially no increase in responders’ IgG or neutralisation capacity and no increase in the numbers
seroconverting. Moreover, whereas a primary inoculum was somewhat better at inducing T cell than
antibody responses, T cell reactivity too did not improve naturally over the following two weeks, showing
some tendency to wane. By contrast, each of those metrics was significantly increased in solid cancer
patients by boosting at day-21.
Impacts of disease, treatments, and pre-exposure
Given that most cancer patients did not seroconvert following a primary vaccine inoculum, we investigated
in greater detail factors that might associate with poor responsiveness, scrutinising types of malignancy,
treatment, and baseline immunophenotypes, albeit that the heterogeneity of the vaccine cohorts
undermined statistical power in several areas. This notwithstanding, we found that serological nonresponders, which were the most common phenotype among haematological cancers, were spread evenly
across patients with B-, T-, and myeloid-cell malignancies (Figure 6A). For solid cancers, non-responders
were again spread comparably across diverse tumour types, with some enrichment in respiratory tract
cancers (Figure 6B). Non-responders were also somewhat more frequent among those who received the
vaccine within 15 days of cancer treatment, particularly chemotherapy (Figure 6C). Indeed, 8/9 patients
who were serological non-responders but T cell responders had had intensive treatments, including those
depleting B cells, before or after the vaccine inoculum. This notwithstanding, the very high effectiveness
of boosting in solid cancer patients suggested its power to counteract factors mitigating vaccine efficacy.
As considered above, 17 individuals were excluded from the main study comparisons because of suspected
SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Nonetheless, when their serological and T cell responses were viewed, they
showed considerable heterogeneity across the dynamic ranges described for the main cohorts (Figure Supp

3). Thus, swab-test and/or serological evidence indicative of prior or concurrent exposure did not
guarantee stronger vaccine responses in the small number of study participants examined here.
DISCUSSION
Here, we present the first report of safety and immune efficacy (a.k.a. immunogenicity) for any COVID-19
vaccine in immunocompromised patient populations, specifically, those with an active cancer diagnosis.
The RNA-based SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine administered in cancer patients was
generally well tolerated, even in those on immunotherapy where exacerbated immune activity might have
been deemed a risk. Nonetheless, single dose vaccination was profoundly less immunogenic in cancer
patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). Notably, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses at week 3
following the first dose were 39% and 13% in the solid and haematological cancers, compared to 97% in
HCs. Immunological parameters in cancer patients did not improve in the subsequent two weeks without
boosting. Crucially, however, each immunological metric measured significantly and substantially
improved in solid cancer patients following a day-21 boost; to date, numbers of boosted haematological
cancer patients are insufficient to assess its impact.
A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 (30μg per dose, given 21 days apart) was reported to be 95% effective
against Covid-19 in non-immunocompromised patient populations.8 Patients with immunocompromise
due to solid tumour and haematological cancers, organ transplantation, haematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, and autoimmune diseases on biological agents were excluded from COVID-19 vaccine
clinical trials. Previous studies on seasonal vaccines have reported suboptimal vaccine efficacy in
immunocompromised populations.13–15 Our data show that following first dose, most solid and
haematological cancer patients remained wholly or partially immunologically unprotected up until at least
5 weeks following primary inoculum. Thus, delaying the day-21 boost for these patients may have serious
implications, both for the individual and for controlling the pandemic. As we and others have reported,
immunocompromised patients have a higher incidence of harbouring persistent SARS-CoV-2
infections10,16,17, possibly representing an important reservoir for the emergence of novel viral variants.26,27
This may likewise apply to any patients who might reasonably be assumed to be immunocompromised.
From these perspectives, the case is made for urgently re-evaluating UK policy for the BNT162b2 dosing
interval for all cancer patients, and other high-risk groups, prima facie consistent with the JCVI’s update
(12th February 2021) recognising that specific populations may mount inferior responses.9 Additionally,
studies to investigate the immunogenicity of more frequent boosts in immunocompromised patients who
remain seronegative are warranted.

Although correlates of protection against COVID-19 remain incompletely defined, it is broadly
considered that neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells will be required for vaccine
efficacy.28,29 Our immunogenicity results after a single BNT162b2 vaccine dose showed that >90% of
HC generated cytokine-producing T cells and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and displayed virusneutralizing capacity, in agreement with other efficacy data.19 Nonetheless, this does not necessarily
mean that vaccine boosting has negligible impact in HCs, since parameters such as durable
immunological memory were not measured. Moreover, it is striking that a single vaccine inoculum
was not as effective at inducing neutralisation of VOC.B.1.1.7 versus the WT strain, but that this was
improved in several participants by boosting. This seems germane to our concerns about the potential
for VOCs to emerge under the umbrella of partial protection.
A single vaccine inoculum evidently induced IFN-γ and/or IL-2-producing RBD-reactive and S2reactive T cells in solid cancer patients, but the proportion of seroconversion in this cohort was less than
half than that of HC, with consequent deficiencies in virus neutralization. In contrast, 95% of solid cancer
patients who received the BNT162b2 vaccine according to the approved day-21 prime-boost regimen
seroconverted 2 weeks after boost, and their antibodies neutralized both the Wuhan and the B.1.1.7 strain.
Hence, a policy of day-21 boosting rapidly conferred immunological protection on a hitherto largely
unprotected population. Given the incidence of solid cancers, this amounts to a very large population.

Patients with haematological malignancies are reportedly at increased risk of adverse outcomes from
SARS-CoV-230 and given this vulnerability, there is an urgent need to protect this population
expeditiously. Thus, the extremely poor immunogenicity following a single vaccine inoculation of
haematological cancer patients is of particular concern. Clearly, this is not an entirely unexpected finding
given the immunobiology of the underlying diseases and the fact that many patients with mature B cell
malignancies have experienced prior or concurrent B cell depleting agents. Nonetheless, although our
interim analysis was insufficiently powered to assess the impact of the day-21 boost in these patients, it is
strikingly clear that increased measures are urgently required to confer immunological protection, most
likely comprising prompt vaccine boosting and frequent serological monitoring. Until such measures are
introduced, it seems important that this population continues to observe all COVID-19-associated
measures such as social distancing and shielding when attending hospitals, even after vaccination.
Moreover, whereas cancer patients in the UK were assigned vaccination priority level 4, no prioritisation
was given to non-professional carers and/or immediate social contacts, who may potentially transmit virus
to incompletely protected patients and/or be infected by them. Possibly these groups should be considered
as priorities in future pandemic planning, in part to limit nodes of increased transmission and VOC
emergence.
It might be argued that irrespective of immunogenicity data, evidence for protection is provided by there
being no new positive swab tests post day-21. Moreover, it has been considered that SARS-CoV-2
infection may de facto provide a boost to incompletely protected patients. We consider these viewpoints as
currently unsubstantiated, noting that 17 individuals suspected of prior exposure did not all make strong
responses to the vaccine, and that several haematological patients with S2-specific T cell reactivity did
not acquire T cell reactivity to RBD. Thus, we conclude that no understanding was available of the risk of
changing from a planned day-21 boost to a delayed 12-week boost in cancer patients at the time of UK
policy change. Our BNT162b2 immunogenicity data raises serious concerns that maximising population
coverage for the general population with the first dose has come at a price of increased risk to “clinically
extremely vulnerable” groups, for whom we suggest an urgent review of current UK vaccine strategy.

B. Progression of PCR swab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection following first dose of vaccine.
C. Spike-specific IgG titres prior to vaccination in healthy controls (n=14), solid tumour cancer
patients (n=59) and haematological cancer patients (n=34), illustrating seropositivity threshold
(horizontal line at EC50 dilution of 70) and suspected pre-exposed individuals.
D. N-specific IgG titres prior to and following vaccination, highlighting PCR-swab confirmed and
baseline Spike-high healthy controls (n=3) and solid tumour cancer patients (n=5) (red), and other
healthy controls (n=2), solid tumour cancer patients (n=4) and haematological cancer patients
(n=3) suspected of pre-existing or developing SARS-CoV-2 infection due to high N IgG titres
(grey). Horizontal line indicates N-specific IgG threshold for suspected infection. White dots
indicate remaining healthy controls (n=41), solid tumour cancer patients (n=60) and
haematological cancer patients (n=42) from combined vaccination cohorts.
E. Neutralization titres against WT and B.1.1.7 strains SARS-CoV-2 from sera of healthy controls
(n=16) at 3 weeks post-vaccination. Paired Wilcoxon test.
Supplementary figure 2. QC and combined T-cell responses to COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2
A. IFN-γ+ and IL-2+ response to stimulation with peptides from RBD and S2 was reported as number
of spots per 106 cells in a negative and a positive PBMC sample that was run alongside for every
assay. Variation in the response among different batches was assessed with CVs as follows: IFN-γ
in S2 (1.702, 0.198), IFN-γ in RBD (1.380, 0.155), IL-2 in S2 (0.943, 0.222), IL-2 in RBD (1.133,
0.209) for the negative and the positive controls, respectively.
B. Determining a cut-off value for assigning positive and negative fluorospot responses. Graph
represents a ROC plot showing assay diagnostic sensitivity against specificity (one minus
proportion of false positives) following detection of IFN-γ and IL-2 fluorospot responses to RBD
and S2 peptide pools in healthy control subjects before and following one dose of BNT162b2. By
convention, we selected the cut-off value that provides an operating position nearest to that of the
“perfect test” (i.e., closest approximation to 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity), which was
6
≥7 cytokine secreting cells/10 PBMC.
C. IFN-γ+ and IL-2+ dual producers after stimulation with peptides from RBD, S2 and CEFCEFT was reported as number of spots per 106 cells in PBMC samples at 3weeks post vaccine in
healthy controls n=17 (blue), solid tumour cancer patients n=31 (yellow) or haematological
cancer patients n=18 (red). Bar represents median value by group, horizontal line represents T cell
response threshold (7). Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test.
Supplementary figure 3: Serological and T cell responses in vaccinated individuals with
concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Patients returning a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab and those displaying baseline seropositivity to
Spike or high N-specific IgG titres at any point (all red; PCR swab positive also diamond) were
excluded from the prior analysis. Here they are shown in the context of other patients who were not
suspected of natural infection (white). Lines link repeated samples from individual patients.
A. Spike-specific IgG titres in suspected naturally infected healthy controls (n=5), solid tumour
cancer patients (n=9), haematological cancer patients (n=3), as compared to the remaining cohort
of healthy controls (n=41), solid tumour cancer patients (n=60) and haematological cancer
patients (n=42). Horizontal line indicates Spike seropositivity threshold (70).
B. IFN-γ+ T cell response to S2 peptides in suspected naturally infected healthy controls (n=3), solid
tumour cancer patients (n=4), haematological cancer patients (n=1), as compared to the remaining
cohort of healthy controls (n=17), solid tumour cancer patients (n=31) and haematological cancer
patients (n=22). Horizontal line indicates T cell response threshold (7).
C. IL-2+ T cell response to S2 peptides in suspected naturally infected healthy controls (n=3), solid
tumour cancer patients (n=4), haematological cancer patients (n=1), as compared to the remaining
