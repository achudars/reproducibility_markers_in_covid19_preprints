Abstract

32

Background: Prospective observational data show that infected persons with the severe acute

33

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

34

positive for a prolonged duration, and that detectable antibodies develop slowly with time. We

35

aimed to analyze how these effects can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and

36

monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

37

Methods: An age-structured mathematical model was constructed to simulate progression of

38

SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in populations. PCR testing to diagnose infection and cross-sectional

39

surveys to measure seroprevalence were also simulated. Analyses were conducted on simulated

40

outcomes assuming a natural epidemic time course and an epidemic in presence of interventions.

41

Results: The prolonged PCR positivity biased the epidemiological measures. There was a lag of

42

10 days between the true epidemic peak and the actually-observed peak. Prior to epidemic peak,

43

PCR positivity rate was 2-fold higher than that based only on current active infection, and half of

44

those tested positive by PCR were in the prolonged PCR positivity stage after infection

45

clearance. Post epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate poorly predicted true trend in active infection.

46

Meanwhile, the prolonged PCR positivity did not appreciably bias estimation of the basic

47

reproduction number R0. The time delay in development of detectable antibodies biased

48

measured seroprevalence. The actually-observed seroprevalence substantially underestimated

49

true prevalence of ever infection, with the underestimation being most pronounced around

50

epidemic peak.

Background

58

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 [1]

59

and resulted in a pandemic [2]. As the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and coronavirus

60

disease 2019 (COVID-19) related deaths continue to rise [2], this virus will persist as a global

61

public health concern.

62

At present, the main diagnostic modality for SARS-CoV-2 is the polymerase chain reaction

63

(PCR) test, which is typically performed on either an upper or lower respiratory tract sample.

64

Current understanding of the infection course suggests a latent phase of few days, followed by an

65

infectious phase also of few days before recovery [1, 3-6]. Individuals infected with the virus test

66

positive by PCR if tested during these first two stages, but also can test positive during the

67

recovery stage for 2-4 weeks, reflecting genetic remnants of the virus [7, 8]. The latter duration

68

defines the prolonged PCR positivity duration following end of infectiousness.

69

Individuals recovered from this infection also typically do not develop detectable IgG antibodies

70

immediately, but 2-4 weeks thereafter [7, 8]. The latter duration defines the pre-antibody

71

positivity duration following end of infectiousness.

72

The presence of the prolonged PCR positivity duration and the pre-antibody positivity duration

73

can complicate the epidemiological inferences drawn from population-based testing by PCR and

74

serological assays. Using mathematical modeling simulations, the aim of the present study is to

75

analyze how these durations can bias the key epidemiological metrics that are used to track and

76

monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, for the purpose of improving interpretation of PCR and

77

serological testing data and our understanding of local epidemics, but also for better management

78

of the adverse implications of the social and physical distancing restrictions.

79

Methods

80

Mathematical model

81

An age-structured mathematical model was developed to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission

82

dynamics in a given generic population (Appendix Figure S1), as informed by recent modeling

83

studies [9-11]. The model was structured factoring current understanding of SARS-CoV-2

84

epidemiology, and stratifies the population into compartments according to age group, infection

85

status, infection stage, and disease stage. Following a latency period, infected individuals

86

progress to either asymptomatic/mild infection followed by recovery, or they progress to severe

87

or critical infection. Severe or critical infection progresses to severe or critical disease,

88

respectively, prior to recovery, but critical disease cases have an additional risk for COVID-19

89

mortality.

90

The model further includes three tracking population compartments for the prolonged PCR

91

positivity, pre-antibody positivity, and antibody positivity. Informed by empirical evidence [7,

92

8], it was assumed that infected individuals remain in the prolonged PCR positivity stage for 3

93

weeks on average and in the pre-antibody positivity stage also for 3 weeks on average. Some of

94

the analyses below explored the impact of other values for these durations.

95

Description of the model structure, equations, and parameters are in the Appendix. All analyses

96

were conducted on the MATLAB R2019a platform.

97

Analysis scenarios

98

Two types of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics were simulated in this generic population: one assuming a

99

basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.0, reflecting the natural course of the epidemic in absence of

100

any social or physical distancing interventions [12, 13], and one assuming an R0 of 1.6, reflecting

101

an epidemic in presence of these interventions, such as that of Qatar where R0 was estimated at

102

about 1.6 [10].

103

Random PCR testing was simulated on this population through Monte Carlo sampling. Trend in

104

PCR positive diagnoses was generated assuming first that individuals are PCR positive only

105

during infection latency and infectiousness (that is during only active infection), and then

106

assuming that individuals are PCR positive during infection latency, infectiousness, and the

107

prolonged PCR positivity following end of infectiousness. These two simulated trends represent

108

thus the true active infection presence in the population and the actually-observed presence

109

through PCR testing, respectively.

110

Repeated daily cross-sectional surveys to measure antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) were

111

also simulated on this population by Monte Carlo sampling a random sample every day. The

112

trend in seroprevalence was generated assuming that individuals develop detectable antibodies

113

immediately following onset of infection (that is detectable antibodies reflect actual infection

114

once the infection occurs), and then assuming that individuals develop detectable antibodies only

115

after passing through the stage of pre-antibody positivity following end of infectiousness. Once

116

antibodies develop, it was assumed that they would persist for a long duration, beyond the

117

simulation timeframe. These two simulated trends represent thus the true prevalence of ever

118

infection in the population and the actually-observed seroprevalence as measured using

119

serological assays, respectively.

120

Results

121

Figure 1 shows the simulated daily number of PCR-positive diagnosed cases in the scenario that

122

PCR positivity measures true active infection presence in the population compared to the

123

actually-observed scenario in presence of the prolonged PCR positivity. There is a lag of 10 days

124

between the true peak in infection incidence and the actually-observed peak in infection

125

incidence when R0 is 1.6, and a lag of 5 days when R0 is 3.0. Moreover, the scenario

126

incorporating the prolonged PCR positivity results in more cases being diagnosed than the

127

scenario in which infected individuals are PCR positive only during active infection.

128

Figure 2 shows the ratio of the proportion of tests that are PCR positive (“positivity rate”) in

129

presence of the prolonged PCR positivity divided by the proportion of tests that are PCR positive

130

assuming no prolonged PCR positivity. This ratio is shown assuming a prolonged PCR positivity

131

duration of 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks. Prior to the epidemic peak, the proportion of tests that are PCR

132

positive in presence of the prolonged PCR positivity is 2-fold higher than that assuming no

133

prolonged PCR positivity. Meanwhile, after the epidemic peak, the ratio of the two proportions

134

steadily increases and is higher the longer is the prolonged PCR positivity—that is more and

135

more of the infections are diagnosed not during active infection, but during the prolonged PCR

136

positivity stage. These results were generated assuming an R0 of 1.6, and the results assuming an

137

R0 of 3.0 show the same pattern (Appendix Figure S2).

138

Figure 3 presents the difference in days between the epidemic peak as measured in presence of

139

the prolonged PCR positivity and the epidemic peak based on true incidence of active infection

140

in the population, assuming a prolonged PCR positivity duration of 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks. The delay

141

between the true epidemic peak and the observed epidemic peak increased as the duration of

142

prolonged PCR positivity increased. This delay ranged from 7.5 days up to 16.5 days at an R0 of

143

1.6, and from 4.5 days up to 8.0 days at an R0 of 3.0.

144

Figure 4 and Figure S3 of the Appendix illustrate the change throughout the epidemic in the

145

proportion of those who test positive by PCR and are latently infected, infectious, or post-

146

infectious (that is in the prolonged PCR positivity stage) for R0 = 1.6 and R0 = 3.0 , respectively.

147

For R0 = 1.6 , prior to the epidemic peak, approximately half of those who test positive by PCR

148

are in the prolonged PCR positivity stage (that is already recovered from the infection). After the

149

epidemic peak, this proportion rises steeply as the epidemic begins to decline. A similar pattern

150

is seen for R0 = 3.0 (Figure S3 of the Appendix).

151

Figure S4 of the Appendix shows the estimated R0 as derived from the epidemic curve of

152

diagnosed cases in presence and in absence of the prolonged PCR positivity. Two scenarios are

153

presented, the first for an R0 of 1.6, and the second for an R0 of 3.0, and each factoring a

154

prolonged PCR positivity duration of 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks. The estimated R0 from the actually-

155

observed diagnosed cases is always lower than that estimated from the true (active infection)

156

diagnosed cases, but the difference is small, particularly so for the case of R0 of 1.6, and is not

157

much affected by the duration of the prolonged PCR positivity.

158

159

actually-observed seroprevalence factoring the 3 weeks average delay in the development of

160

detectable antibodies [7, 8]. Two scenarios are presented, the first for an R0 of 1.6 and the second

161

for an R0 of 3.0. There is a time delay in the actually-observed seroprevalence reaching the true

162

prevalence of ever infection in the population, and this delay varies with time reflecting the

163

epidemic phase (particularly closeness to the epidemic peak) and the intensity of the epidemic

164

(value of R0).

165

Discussion

166

Management of an epidemic depends on availability of high quality real-time data in order to

167

make the best decisions. Above results show that presence of the prolonged PCR positivity, one

168

of the distinctive features of the SARS-CoV-2 infection reflecting the presence of genetic

169

remnants of the virus in those who cleared their infection [7, 8], biases the epidemiological

170

metrics and inferences drawn from the trend of PCR-positive diagnosed cases. While the

171

prolonged PCR positivity allows more infections to be diagnosed (Figure 1), it biases assessment

172

of the epidemic phase. The true phase of the epidemic (epidemic peak and also epidemic growth

173

or decline) occurs 1-2 weeks before the actually-observed phase of the epidemic (Figures 1 and

174

3). This implies that the trend in PCR-positive diagnosed cases does not reflect the current status

175

of the epidemic, but the status 1-2 weeks earlier. However, the prolonged PCR positivity does

176

not appreciably bias the derivation of R0 from the actually-observed trend in diagnosed cases

177

(Appendix Figure S4).

178

The prolonged PCR positivity also biases the testing positivity rate. The actually-observed

179

positivity rate is 2-fold higher than the true positivity rate of active infection during the epidemic

180

growth phase, and several folds higher during the epidemic decline phase (Figure 2). As the

181

epidemic declines, the value of the positivity rate in conveying the actual epidemic dynamics

182

erodes steadily with time. Moreover, during the epidemic growth phase, as much as half of those

183

who test positive by PCR are in the prolonged PCR positivity stage having already recovered

184

from the infection. During the epidemic decline phase, increasingly most of those testing positive

185

are found in the prolonged PCR positivity stage and not in active infection (Figure 4).

186

Remarkably, at all times, those newly diagnosed with the infection are likely to be found in a

187

non-infectious stage.

188

Above results demonstrate that the documented time delay in development of detectable

189

antibodies [7, 8] biases measures of seroprevalence that are derived from cross-sectional surveys

190

of the population. At all times prior to end of the epidemic cycle, actually-observed

191

seroprevalence underestimates true prevalence of ever infection in the population (Figure 5). The

192

difference between what is actually observed and what is true is most pronounced around the

193

epidemic peak. This finding demonstrates that current seroprevalence studies can significantly

194

underestimate actual infection exposure in the population at large; an important consideration

195

given that communities are increasingly undertaking sero-surveys to understand better virus

196

spread and to develop efficient plans for managing the hefty costs of the social and physical

197

distancing restrictions on society and economy.

198

This study has limitations. PCR testing was assumed random, but in reality this depends on the

199

actual testing policy that is enforced in any setting. For instance, administering PCR testing to

200

only those presenting with clinical symptoms will differentially bias detection towards those who

201

acquired the infection within the last 5-10 days. The above results thus need to be complemented

202

with further analysis for each specific setting to factor the actually-enforced testing policy. While

203

the prolonged PCR positivity and the time delay in development of detectable antibodies are

204

well-established in the literature [7, 8], it is still not sufficiently known how these are distributed

205

in the population by age and sex, factors that may influence these effects and their impact on

206

epidemiological measures. Epidemiological metrics can also be biased by other aspects of PCR

207

and antibody testing, such as assay sensitivity and specificity, which are not investigated in the

208

present study.

209

Conclusions

210

The prolonged PCR positivity observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected persons and the time delay in

211

development of detectable antibodies can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and

212

monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics leading to implications for managing the social and physical

213

distancing restrictions. Caution is warranted in interpreting PCR and serological testing data, and

214

any drawn inferences need to factor these biases for an accurate assessment of epidemic

215

dynamics. These findings also suggest that analysis of PCR and serological testing data should

216

not only be based on dichotomous outcomes (positive versus negative), but should also factor the

217

quantitative measures of PCR and serological assays (such as PCR cycle threshold and antibody

218

optical density values) to improve interpretation of these metrics.

Figure 1. Effect of the prolonged PCR positivity on the observed trend of diagnosed cases.
Daily number of new diagnosed cases of true active infection versus the actually-observed
diagnosed cases in presence of the prolonged PCR positivity. The prolonged PCR positivity is
assumed to last on average for three weeks after end of infectiousness [7, 8]. Two scenarios are
presented, one for an R0 of 1.6 (an epidemic in presence of social and physical distancing
interventions) and an R0 of 3.0 (natural course of the epidemic in absence of any social or
physical distancing interventions).

Figure 2. Effect of the prolonged PCR positivity on the observed SARS-CoV-2 positivity
rate. Ratio of the proportion of tests that are PCR positive (“positivity rate”) in presence of the
prolonged PCR positivity over the proportion of tests that are PCR positive assuming no
prolonged PCR positivity. The prolonged PCR positivity is assumed to last on average for 2, 3,
4, and 6 weeks. In this epidemic simulation, R0 has a value of 1.6, that is an epidemic time course
in presence of social and physical distancing interventions. The simulation for R0 of 3.0, that is
for the natural course of the epidemic in absence of any social or physical distancing
interventions, is found in Figure S2.

Figure 3. Effect of the prolonged PCR positivity on the observed SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
peak. Time difference between the actually-observed epidemic peak in presence of the
prolonged PCR positivity and the true epidemic peak based on true incidence of active infection
in the population. The prolonged PCR positivity is assumed to last on average for 2, 3, 4, and 6
weeks. Two scenarios are presented, one for an R0 of 1.6 (an epidemic in presence of social and
physical distancing interventions) and an R0 of 3.0 (natural course of the epidemic in absence of
any social or physical distancing interventions).

Figure 4. Effect of the prolonged PCR positivity on distribution of those latently infected,
infectious, and post-infectious. Proportion of new diagnoses who are in latent infection, stage
of infectiousness, or stage of prolonged PCR positivity. The prolonged PCR positivity is
assumed to last on average for three weeks after end of infectiousness [7, 8]. In this epidemic
simulation, R0 has a value of 1.6, that is an epidemic time course in presence of social and
physical distancing interventions. The simulation for R0 of 3.0, that is for the natural course of
the epidemic in absence of any social or physical distancing interventions, is found in Figure S3.

Figure 5. Effect of delay in development of detectable antibodies on observed
seroprevalence in cross-sectional surveys. Trend in the true prevalence of ever infection in the
population versus the actually-observed seroprevalence factoring the 3 weeks average delay in
the development of detectable antibodies [7, 8]. Two scenarios are presented, one for an R0 of 1.6
(an epidemic in presence of social and physical distancing interventions) and an R0 of 3.0
(natural course of the epidemic in absence of any social or physical distancing interventions).
