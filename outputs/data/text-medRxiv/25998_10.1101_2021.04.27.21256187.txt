Abstract
Background
Vaccination against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the
elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of vaccinations on
the mortality of elderly individuals in a context of wide transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma
(P.1) variant.

Methods
By May 27, 2021, 147238,414 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality
Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting
population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages
70-79 and 80+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated for deaths due to COVID-19
and to other causes, as were COVID-19 mortality rate ratios relative to individuals aged 0-69
years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health. All results were
tabulated by epidemiological weeks 1-19, 2021.

Findings
The proportion of all COVID-19 deaths at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and
declined rapidly to 12.4% in week 19, whereas proportionate COVID-19 mortality for
individuals aged 70-79 years started to decline by week 15. Trends in proportionate mortality
due to other causes remained stable. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+
years age group compared to that of 0-69 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 5.0 times in
week 19. Vaccination coverage (first dose) of 90% was reached by week 9 for individuals aged
80+ years and by week 13 for those aged 70-79 years. Coronavac accounted for 65.4% and
AstraZeneca for 29.8% of all doses administered in weeks 1-4, compared to 36.5% and 53.3%
in weeks 15-19, respectively.

Interpretation
Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with
important declines in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where
the gamma variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained
proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 43,802 COVIDrelated deaths would have been expected up to week 19.

Introduction
In early 2021, Brazil became the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic 1 with an average
of over 2,000 daily deaths in recent months.2 The gamma or P.1 variant, initially identified in
Manaus in late 20203 has rapidly spread throughout the country.4 Although genomic analyses
are infrequent, in April and May 2021 the new variant accounted for three out of every four
samples subjected to viral sequencing.5
Vaccination against COVID-19 was started in late January 2021, with two types of vaccines
being offered: Coronavac (Sinovac, China) and AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca, UK). Vaccination
has been initially targeted at four priority groups: health workers, the elderly (starting with
those aged 85 years or more, and gradually vaccinating younger age groups), indigenous
populations, and institutionalized individuals. By May 28, 41,478,005 Brazilians had received
the first dose, and 19,604,603 the second dose. 6
Vaccination campaigns have been associated with reductions in hospital admissions and
mortality among targeted population groups, in several of the early starting countries. 7-9 Yet,
there is limited evidence on the efficacy of the two vaccines being delivered in Brazil against
the gamma variant that currently accounts for the majority of cases in the country. Two
observational studies among health care workers in Manaus10 and São Paulo11 suggested that
the Coronavac provided partial protection against symptomatic illness in settings where
gamma accounted for 75% and 47% of all infections, respectively, at the time of the study. Yet,
there is growing concern that high SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates such as those observed in Brazil
in early 2021 will lead to the appearance of new variants of concern as well as increase in the
risk of vaccine escape. 12
To evaluate the real-life effectiveness of the vaccination campaign in Brazil, we analyzed time
trends in mortality due to COVID-19 using a database of over 430,000 registered deaths. We
hypothesized that mortality would fall more rapidly among the elderly, who were the initial
target group of the vaccination campaign, than among younger Brazilians.

Methods
Data on COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Ministry of Health Mortality Information
System13 including deaths reported until May 27, 2021. Coverage of the death registration
system has been estimated at over 95% by 2010. 14 As of 2016, the Global Burden of Disease
project assigned four out of five stars for the system’s coverage and quality of cause of death
ascertainment,15 and by 2019 5.6% of all deaths were coded as due to ill-defined causes
(França GA, unpublished data). We analyzed deaths for which the underlying cause was coded
as B34.2, which included codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) and U07.2 (COVID-19, virus
not identified).16 For 84% of 2021 deaths, presence of the virus was confirmed in a laboratory
(preliminary results based on investigation of 163,637 deaths).
Data on COVID-19 vaccination coverage were obtained from a dataset made available by the
Brazilian Ministry of Health.6 The data are updated daily and consist of an individual level
dataset including personal information and information on the vaccination (type and dose)
along with whether it is the first or second dose received and the priority group for the person
vaccinated. The data used here were up to May 15, 2021.

Population estimates for July 1st 2020 by single age and sex were obtained from the Brazilian
Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE).17 Due to the excess mortality observed in 2020
and the higher COVID-19 mortality among the elderly,18 the population numbers from IBGE for
2020 are overestimated, particularly at older ages. Since vaccination started in Brazil in early
January 2021, it is imperative to obtain an adjusted estimated population that more closely
reflects the Brazilian population by the end of 2020. We considered the total deaths that were
reported in 2020 (for all causes, as reported in the Mortality Information System), and the
expected deaths as implied in the IBGE estimates. We excluded the additional number of
deaths from the published 2020 estimates and used that adjusted population as the
denominator in our analyses. All adjustments were made by age and sex. All calculations were
done in R (R core team, 2020).
Mortality results were analyzed in two ways. First, we calculated proportionate mortality by
dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at ages 70-79 and 80+ years by the total number of
COVID-19 deaths at all ages. Our main analyses described mortality by epidemiological week in
2021, which are supported by analyses by month of death during 2020. To investigate whether
age-specific trends in proportionate mortality were specific to COVID-19 deaths, we also
investigated trends due to other causes of death. Second, we calculated COVID-19 age-specific
mortality rates by dividing the numbers of weekly deaths from the Mortality Information
System by the estimated population by age group, as described above. Mortality rates at ages
70-79 and 80+ years were then divided by rates for the age range 0-9 years in the same week,
resulting in mortality rate ratios.
Formal statistical tests were not performed as all results are based on the full country
population, rather than samples. Analyses were carried out using Stata version 16 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA). All analyses were based on publicly available, anonymized databases.

Results
From the beginning of the first epidemiological week in 2021 (January 3) to May 27, 238,414
deaths in the Mortality Information System were assigned to COVID-19 and 447,817 to other
causes. Supplementary Table 1 shows the absolute number of COVID-19 deaths for
epidemiological weeks 1-19 of 2021 (January 3 to May 15). There was rapid acceleration in
deaths from week 9 (early March) when the gamma variant became the dominant strain.
Results for weeks 17-19 (April 25 to May 15) are likely affected by registration delay but
remain useful for comparing age-specific proportionate mortality and mortality rate ratios.
Table 1 does not include deaths occurring after epidemiological week 19 (May 16 or later) as
these are more markedly affected by delay than earlier deaths.
Figure 1 shows that proportionate COVID-19 mortality of individuals aged 80+ years fell rapidly
from week 6 onwards, whereas proportionate mortality due to non-COVID causes remained
relatively stable at just under 30%. Up to May 27, an additional 7,733 deaths had been
reported for epidemiological weeks 20 and 21, of which 13.1% were among individuals aged
80+, a finding that is consistent with the levels achieved by week 15. Figure 1 also shows that
proportionate mortality for individuals aged 70-79 years remained at around 25% up to week
15, when it started to decline sharply. For the same age group, proportionate mortality due to
other causes remained stable at just over 20% of deaths at any age.

Supplementary Figure 1 shows that proportionate mortality at ages 80+ years fell in all regions
of the country. The trend was less marked in the North region (where the Amazon is located)
than in the rest of the country. Supplementary Figure 2 expands the time series by showing
proportionate mortality based on 453,244 COVID-19 deaths that occurred since the beginning
of the pandemic in the country. From May 2020 (when the monthly number of deaths
exceeded 15,000) to January 2021, proportionate mortality at ages 80+ remained between
25% and 30%, with a sharp reduction starting in mid-February 2021. Proportionate mortality at
ages 70-79 years remained above 20% until March 2021, with a substantial decline in AprilMay. Also showing data for 2020 and 2021, Supplementary Figure 3 demonstrates that the
decline in proportionate mortality was observed for men and women, although proportionate
mortality for women aged 80+ years tended to be higher than for men, likely due to higher life
expectancy of women resulting in fewer deaths in those aged under 80 years.
Figure 2 shows time trends in mortality rate ratios using the age group 0-69 years as the
reference. The mortality rate ratio for persons aged 80+ years fell from over 13.3 in January
and early February to 8.0 in week 19. The decline in the rate ratio for ages 70-79 was more
gradual, from 13.8 in week 1 to 5.0 in week 19. Mortality rate ratios for non-COVID causes
remained stable over time.

Figure 3 shows vaccine coverage for individuals aged 70-79 and 80+ years over time. The
increase in coverage was consistent with prioritization of older population groups, with 50%
coverage reached for individuals aged 80+ years in the first half of February and over 80% by
the second half, stabilizing at around 95% in March. For 70–79-year-olds, 50% coverage was
reached by week 11 and 90% coverage by week 19. Coverage among younger age groups was
largely restricted to priority groups including health workers, indigenous peoples and people
living in institutions. In weeks 1-4, Coronavac accounted for 65.4% of all doses given and
AstraZeneca for 29.8% whereas the corresponding percentages for weeks 15-19 were 36.5%
and 53.3%. Pfizer/BioNTech (Germany) and Serum Institute (India) accounted for the
remaining doses in the recent period.

The downturn in proportionate mortality due to COVID-19 started at about the sixth week of
2021. Had the number of deaths among individuals aged 80+ years continued to increase at
the same rate as deaths among people aged 0-69 y, one would expect 70,015 such deaths
during the 13-week period from mid-Feb to mid-May. Yet, 32,624 deaths were reported, or
37,401 fewer than expected under the scenario of similar trends as for the 0-69 years age
group. A similar calculation was performed for deaths among 70–79-year-olds, among whom
proportionate mortality started to decline around week 15. Compared to 13,838 deaths in
weeks 15-19, 20,238 would be expected if mortality behaved similarly to that observed for 0–
69-year-olds. Adding the two estimates, 43,802 deaths may have been avoided by the decline
in mortality among the elderly.

Discussion
We found evidence that, although dissemination of the gamma variant led to increases in
reported COVID-19 death at all ages, the proportion of deaths among the elderly started to fall
rapidly from the second half of February 2021. This proportion had been stable at around 25%30% since the beginning of the epidemic in early 2020 but is now below 13% in May 2021.
Estimates of proportionate mortality must be interpreted with caution. We now describe how
we handled potential caveats in these analyses.
First, the absolute number of deaths in the elderly may be reduced due to smaller number of
persons at risk, resulting from high mortality in 2020 due to COVID-19 and other causes. In an
estimated population of approximately 815 thousand Brazilians aged 90+ years in 2020, there
were approximately 144 thousand deaths in the calendar year, of which about 10% were
reported as being caused by COVID-19. To address this potential caveat, our calculations of
mortality rates for 2021 were based on population estimates at the beginning of the year from
which all-cause deaths had already been deducted.
Second, proportionate mortality may be spuriously reduced among the elderly if the gamma
variant of concern disproportionally affected younger individuals, either in terms of infection
rates or of infection-fatality rates. The EPICOVID-19 study has been monitoring prevalence of
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 through household surveys in nine large cities in the state of
Rio Grande do Sul since April 2020. In early February 2021, antibody prevalence levels were
9.6%, 11.3%, 10.0% and 8.3% for unvaccinated individuals aged 10-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+
years, respectively (AJD Barros, personal communication). The state has been strongly affected
by the recent pandemic wave, yet there is no evidence of important age patterns in antibody
prevalence.
Thirdly, our results based on ratios of mortality rates closely mirror the findings from the
proportionate mortality analyses, showing that the rate ratio for individuals aged 80+ relative
to those aged 0-69 years fell from 13.3 in January to 8.0 in April.
Lastly, our analyses of deaths due to causes other than COVID-19 showed that proportionate
mortality and mortality rate ratios for the elderly remained stable over time, thus supporting
the specificity of an impact on COVID-19 deaths.

Another potential limitation of our analyses is the underreporting of deaths and delays in
reporting. Delays are particularly relevant for estimating mortality rates for recent periods, as
only deaths that reached the system by May 27 were included. However, proportionate
mortality by age groups would only be affected if delays varied systematically with age, which
is unlikely. As discussed in the Introduction, the overall coverage of mortality statistics has
been very high in Brazil for many years, and ill-defined causes represent 5.6% of all deaths. The
mortality database for the present analyses includes approximately 30% more deaths than the
SIVEP-Gripe database on hospital admissions and mortality that has been employed in
previous analyses of COVID-19 deaths in Brazil.18-20
However, there is evidence that the excess mortality during 2020 relative to earlier years was
not fully explained by deaths due to COVID-19. It is likely that some of such deaths were
reported as having been due to other causes or to ill-defined conditions, but it is also possible
that increases in non-COVID-19 deaths were because health services were under stress due to
the large COVID-19 case load. Unless reporting patterns varied by age or calendar time, this
limitation is unlikely to affect the present results particularly in light of the present finding that
age patterns in deaths assigned to non-COVID causes remained stable.
The decline in mortality was observed for both sexes. Proportionate mortality at older ages
was higher among women than for men, which is compatible with higher case-fatality of
younger male adults, possibly related to comorbidities, given that existing serological surveys
do not suggest differences in infection prevalence by sex.21,22 The reductions in proportionate
mortality were very similar across four of the five regions of the country. A decline was also
observed in the fifth region (Northern Brazil including the Amazon), but proportionate
mortality was lower at the beginning of the year than in the rest of the country, and the
decline started later than in the rest of the country. The North region has been badly hit by the
first and second waves of the pandemic, and high prevalence, high case-fatality, and the
limited availability of health services in this region23 may have led to a larger number of deaths
among young adults. Even before the pandemic, life expectancy at birth in the North region
was the shortest in the country at 72.9 years, compared to 73.9, 78.3, 78.6 and 75.8 in the
Northeast, Southeast, South and Center-West, respectively.17
The most likely explanation for the observed reductions in proportionate mortality and in rate
ratios for the elderly is the rapid increase in vaccination coverage in these age groups, as has
been described for other parts of the world. 7-9 The increase in vaccine coverage preceded the
decline in mortality, and the decline at ages 80+ years preceded the decline at ages 70-79
years, which is in accordance with the vaccination calendar.
Our results are original in the sense that none of existing population-based mortality studies
were carried out in a setting where the gamma variant is predominant. Recent observational
studies in vaccinated health workers in Manaus and São Paulo10,11 had already suggested that
Coronavac provided some degree of protection against symptomatic illness in settings where
gamma was prevalent. Coronavac accounted for most vaccinations in the 80+ years age group,
who were immunized in January and February, with AstraZeneca vaccine accounting for the
majority of recent doses. Individuals who received the latter are so far protected by a single
dose given that the second dose is provided 12 weeks after the first, whereas the second dose
of Coronavac has already been administered to a very high proportion of individuals aged 80+

years 24 as doses are given four weeks apart. The health worker study in São Paulo suggested
that the number of cases started to drop after the first Coronavac dose, which is compatible
with our findings. 11 This is supported by the results of a recent mass vaccination trial with
Coronavac in the town of Serrana (population 27,000) carried out by Instituto Butantan.
Following high coverage with Coronavac in early 2021, reductions of 86% in admissions and
95% in deaths were observed in the town by the end of May.25
We attempted to provide an approximate estimate of lives saved among elderly Brazilians in
the eight-week period since vaccination was accelerated throughout the country. The figure of
over 40 thousand deaths averted is likely an underestimate, because it does not take into
account lives saved among other priority groups for vaccination, such as health workers and
indigenous populations. Also, by using the mortality in ages 0-69 years to predict expected
deaths among those aged 70+ years, we are not accounting for lives saved by the vaccine
among younger age groups – e.g., 60-69-year-olds - for whom coverage also increased, albeit
at a slower rate. Although it is not possible to make strong causal arguments on the basis of
the data available for our analyses, our findings are consistent with the results of efficacy trials
for both vaccines, and with observational studies in high-risk groups of health workers. 10,11
The main contribution brought by the present analyses is to provide large-scale supporting
evidence for effectiveness of vaccination in a setting with wide circulation of the gamma
variant. Because compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing
and mask use is limited in most of the country, rapid scaling up of vaccination remains as the
most promising approach for controlling the pandemic in a country where almost 500,000 lives
have already been lost to COVID-19.
