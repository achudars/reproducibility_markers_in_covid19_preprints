Abstract

23

Backgrounds: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and some

24

containment measures have changed many people’s lives and behaviours. Whether the

25

pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains

26

unknown.

27

Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and

28

all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19

29

period (2015-2019) in Italy.

30

Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107

31

Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-

32

crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the

33

association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three

34

months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months

35

in 2015-2019.

36

Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th

37

percentile of temperature at 3 ˚C) in comparison with the minimum mortality

38

temperature (24 ˚C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic

39

period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same

40

months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly

41

significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus

42

1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)],

43

and ≥ 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those

44

aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)].

45

Conclusion: The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the risk of

46

cold temperature on mortality in Italy, particularly among the elderly people. Further

1. Introduction

52

With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection sweeping across the globe at

53

a startling speed (Bedford et al. 2020), restrictive social containment measures such as

54

social distance, travel restriction, and regional emergency lockdown, have been widely

55

implemented to limit viral diffusion and reduce deaths from infection. Italy was one of

56

the countries with the largest number of confirmed cases at the beginning of the

57

COVID-19 outbreak. Since the first local transmission started on the 20th of February,

58

the number of reported cases had followed an exponential trend, peaking with 6,557

59

new cases on the 21st of March. Simultaneously, restrictive lockdown measures were

60

implemented to the whole country from the 9th of March and were not downgraded until

61

the end of May 2020.

62
63

The restricted activities have caused profound changes in people’s lives and behaviours.

64

For example, stay-at-home orders would directly decrease outdoor physical activities

65

(Wang et al. 2020) and change the pattern of social contacts (Prem et al. 2020). It may

66

also indirectly lead to the damage of health through delayed health care for acute

67

emergencies (De Filippo et al. 2020; De Rosa et al. 2020), exacerbations of chronic

68

diseases (Wang and Zhang 2020), and psychological depression (Weinberger et al.

69

2020). Moreover, the effect of the pandemic on overall population mortality is unknown.

70

Several recent studies (Banerjee et al. 2020; Weinberger et al. 2020) reported that the

71

overall direct and indirect deaths related to COVID-19 may be underestimated in the

72

pandemic period due to the social containment and mitigation activities. Therefore, it

73

is worthwhile to assess the impact of the pandemic on the overall population health in

74

Italy.

76

The association between ambient temperature and mortality/morbidity outcomes has

77

been well-documented (Gasparrini et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2014). Apart from

78

hypothermia, many adverse health outcomes like cardiovascular and respiratory

79

diseases are associated with both cold and hot temperatures (Guo et al. 2016a; Zhao et

80

al. 2019a; Zhao et al. 2019b). However, the nature of the temperature-mortality

81

relationship in different climates and populations may exhibit significant variation

82

(Carder et al. 2005; Gasparrini et al. 2015). Generally, the non-linear temperature-

83

mortality association is mainly described as a J-, V- or U-shaped curve in different

84

regions and countries worldwide (Gasparrini et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2013; Guo et al.

85

2014; Ryti et al. 2016). The association could be affected by factors like geographic

86

locations, climatological and socioeconomic conditions, and human behaviours

87

(Gasparrini et al. 2015). Therefore, it is warranted to explore the association between

88

the temperature and the mortality during the pandemic period when people’s lives and

89

behaviours have been hugely altered due to the restrictive social interventions.

90
91

Several previous assessments have focused on the effects of temperature variation on

92

the death of COVID-19 (Briz-Redón and Serrano-Aroca 2020; Ma et al. 2020; Xie and

93

Zhu 2020; Yao et al. 2020). However, the number of COVID-19 deaths in official

94

reports is likely underestimated due to improper COVID-19 death certification or the

95

lack of testing availability (Gill and DeJoseph 2020). As a result, many deaths may

96

suffer from misclassification to another respiratory disease, such as influenza. Unlike

97

the deaths attributed to COVID-19, all-cause mortality could be an accurate

98

measurement to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on deaths

99

(Zylke and Bauchner 2020). Apart from avoiding the common misclassification of

100

cause-specific mortality, all-cause mortality incorporates both the deaths from the virus

101

and the mortality indirectly from the pandemic. For example, the incidence of out-of-

102

hospital cardiac arrest was significantly higher during the pandemic period in Italy than

103

that at the same time in 2019 (Baldi et al. 2020; Marijon et al. 2020). Such indirect

104

deaths from the pandemic may increase because of the avoidance of health care or the

105

lack of social supports, especially for the vulnerable population who are concerned

106

about being infected when going to a hospital (Baum and Schwartz 2020; Marijon et al.

107

2020; Rosenbaum 2020). The overlap of vulnerable populations in COVID-19 and

108

temperature-related diseases makes the measurement of the pandemic impacts

109

complexed. Thus, all-cause mortality could be a useful tool to comprehensively assess

110

the impact of temperature on human health in the pandemic.

111
112

In this study, we aimed to identify the risk of all-cause mortality associated with

113

temperature in the early spread period of COVID-19 across the 107 Italian provinces

114

between March 1st, 2020 and May 31st, 2020, and compare the association with that

115

during the same period in 2015-2019. We also performed stratified analyses by sex and

116

age to estimate the influence of temperature on different population in the pandemic

117

period in Italy.

118
119

2. Methods

120

2.1 Data collection

121

We collected daily all-cause mortality data for 7,904 municipalities in 107 provinces of

122

Italy from the Italian Institute of Statistics from January 1st, 2015 to May 31st, 2020,

123

which covered about 93.1% of the Italian territory and population. The mortality counts

124

were grouped into province-level stratified by sex and age. To compare the effects of

125

temperature on mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis was

126

restricted to the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy in 2020 and the

127

same months during 2015-2019, respectively.

128
129

We collected the hourly ambient temperature (at 2 meters above the land surface) and

130

ambient dew point temperature at 0.1°×0.1°spatial resolution from the ERA5 dataset

131

(ERA5) (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home). We aggregated all hourly

132

observations into daily data. This dataset has good temporal and spatial coverage in

133

Italy, but it might be less accurate than observations from weather stations. Thus, we

134

calibrated the ERA5 daily mean temperature and ERA5 daily mean dew point

135

temperature using their relationship with observations of weather stations by building

136

random forest models (see Supplementary materials for detail, Fig. S1-S2). After

137

calibration, the ERA5 daily mean temperature and ERA5 daily mean dew point

138

temperatures were linked to the geographical centre of each of the 7,904 municipalities

139

based on longitude and latitude. We then calculated daily mean relative humidity from

140

the calibrated ERA5 daily mean temperature and ERA5 daily mean dew point

141

temperature using an algorithm provided by the “humidity” R package (Cai 2019).

142

Weather data at municipality level were aggregated into province level by averaging

143

observations of all municipalities within each province. We also collected the daily

144

monitor stations data of particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 micrometres

145

(PM2.5) from World's Air Quality Index Project and linked values of the nearest monitor

146

station to the centre of each Italian province.

148

2.2 Statistics analysis

149

A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to examine the associations between

150

temperature and mortality during the first three months of COVID-19 outbreak and the
7

151

same pre-outbreak period in 2015-2019, respectively. Conditional quasi-Poisson

152

regression was applied to perform the time-stratified case-crossover design (Armstrong

153

et al. 2014). Time-stratified case-crossover design controls the temporal trends and

154

seasonality through matching case and control in a small time window (e.g., calendar

155

month) (Guo et al. 2011). Specifically, the case and controls were matched by the day

156

of the week in the same calendar month in the same province, to control for the effect

157

of intra-week variation, seasonality, and spatial variation. The association between

158

ambient temperature and risk of death was examined using a distributed lag non-linear

159

model (DLNM) (Gasparrini et al. 2010). We used a natural cubic spline with 3 degrees

160

of freedom for the temperature distribution, and a natural cubic spline with 3 degrees

161

of freedom for lags up to 21 days. We chose a lag of 21 days, as previous studies have

162

shown a long lag effect of cold temperature and harvesting effect of hot temperature

163

(Gasparrini et al. 2015; Guo et al. 2011). The daily relative humidity with the same lag

164

days and PM2.5 concentration were included in the model to control their impacts.

165
166

To assess the possible modification effects of demographic factors on the associations

167

between temperature and mortality, stratified analyses were conducted for sex and age

168

groups (<64, 65-74, 75-84, and ≥85 years). Our initial analyses show there were only

169

cold effects on mortality (no hot effects). Therefore, the overall cumulative RRs in

170

previous 21 days corresponding to the 2.5th percentile and the 50th percentile of the

171

temperature distribution during the study period against the minimum mortality

172

temperature (MMT) were calculated to show the effects of extreme and moderately

173

cold temperatures, respectively. We set 24˚C as MMT (reference value/temperature)

174

based on our initial analyses and a previous study to calculate the relative risks (RRs)

175

(Gasparrini et al. 2015).

2.3 Sensitivity analysis

178

Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results. We tested

179

the variation of the temperature-mortality association during non-outbreak of COVID-

180

19 by replacing the study period of 2015-2019 with every single year of the study period.

181

We modified the lag choices by varying the maximum lags to 18 and 24 days in the

182

DLNM to check any changes in the cold temperature-mortality associations.

183
184

All analyses were performed with R software (version 3.5.2). The ‘dlnm’ and ‘gnm’

185

packages were used to fit the DLNM and the conditional Poisson regression,

186

respectively.

187
188

3. Results

189

There were 1,000,459 all-cause deaths from March 1st to May 31st during 2015-2020 in

190

Italy. Table 1 shows the comparison of descriptive statistics between the COVID-19

191

pandemic period in 2020 and the same months during 2015-2019. The study months in

192

the pandemic period in Italy witnessed a slight increase in the ambient temperature

193

(P<0.001) with the average value of 12.5 ± 4.4 ˚C compared with the same months

194

during 2015-2019 (12.3 ± 4.3 ˚C). In addition, the relative humidity and PM2.5 in the

195

pandemic period were significantly lower than the same months during 2015-2019. As

196

for the comparison of the daily average all-cause mortality counts in different age

197

groups, all age groups displayed statistical higher counts in 2020 than the number in

198

2015-2019, except for the 0-64 age group. The death counts in the pandemic period

199

experienced a significantly high number in male and female groups.

associated with cold temperatures in the pandemic period were significantly higher than

age-specific temperature-mortality association, except for the 0-64 age group, the other

three older age groups experienced a significantly higher risk of death in the pandemic

pandemic period, the 65-74 age group reported significantly higher risks than the other

As for the results of sensitivity analysis, the distribution of the temperatures in the same

249

period of 2015-2020 was similar, except for a slightly low temperature in the year 2019

250

(Table S1). We replaced the study period of 2015-2019 with every single year from

251

2015 to 2019 to examine the stability of the association between temperature and all-

252

cause mortality in the period with no pandemic, which gave similar results (Fig. S3).

253

Additionally, we changed the maximum lags days to 18 and 24 days in our model, and

254

it did not modify the results (Fig. S4). Consequently, we believe that our models

255

adequately captured the main effects of temperature on mortality.

259

mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Italy, even in the world. The

260

findings indicated that Italy experienced a higher cold-related excess mortality during

261

the pandemic in comparison to the equivalent time in 2015-2019. The mortality risks

262

associated with cold temperatures observed during the pandemic were more than triple

263

higher than risks noted in 2015-2019 at both extreme and moderately cold temperatures.

264

Furthermore, risks in individuals with 0-64 year of age displayed a non-significant

265

difference in the pandemic and non-pandemic periods. However, people aged ≥65

266

years old were more susceptible to the adverse effects of cold temperature than those

267

<65 years old during the pandemic.

268
269

It is well-documented that cold temperature is responsible for the excess mortality (Guo

270

et al. 2016b; Schwartz et al. 2015; Vardoulakis et al. 2014). For example, a quantitative

271

systematic review estimated that cold exposure was associated with an elevated risk of

272

cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (Bunker et al. 2016). Our results for the non-

273

pandemic period are consistent with a previous multi-country epidemiological study

274

(Gasparrini et al. 2015), in which it assessed the all-cause mortality risk attributed to

275

ambient temperature in Italian 11 cities from 1987 to 2010 and observed a slightly low

276

cold-related mortality, with an RR of 1.09 in cold temperature. However, the results

277

could not be directly compared due to the different study period.

278
279

Various potential biological mechanisms for the effect of cold temperature on the

280

increased mortality risks have been presented, mainly for cardiovascular and

281

respiratory effects (Song et al. 2017). In the case of the association of cold temperature

282

with cardiovascular mortality, cold exposure could increase the angiotensin-II levels in

283

plasma, platelet and red cell counts, blood viscosity, and arterial pressure, which would

284

lead to increased blood pressure and the elevated risks of hypertension and

285

cardiovascular diseases (Analitis et al. 2008; Keatinge et al. 1984). The mechanisms

286

behind the respiratory effects may be associated with the effect of cold temperature on

287

the reduction of respiratory defences against infection and other immunological

288

reactions (Eccles 2002). Meanwhile, the cold temperature could affect the transmission

289

of viruses and enhance the rates of respiratory virus infection (Pica and Bouvier 2014).

290
291

Our results show that more than three times higher cold-related excess mortality during

292

2020 COVID-19 pandemic than the same months during 2015-2019. Even though the

293

potential drivers for such change cannot be directly derived, a multitude of underlying

294

factors are linked to the variation of the cold-mortality association in the pandemic

295

period. Firstly, the contributions of COVID-19 deaths to the cold-related excess

296

mortality need to be taken into account. According to a recent report, in the first 5

297

months of 2020 (with the 191,228 total deaths in Italy), 31,763 (16.6%) was of subjects

298

with swab positive for COVID-19, but the mortality contribution varied by different

299

prevalence locations ranging from 28% in high prevalence to 3% in low-prevalence

300

provinces (National Statistical Institute (Istat) and the InstituteSuperiore di Sanità(Iss)

301

2020). It is noted that the role of ambient temperature in the spread of COVID-19, so

302

far, is not well understood. Obviously, the virus could not subside with the warming of

303

temperature in the world. However, the impact of cold air temperature on COVID-19

304

is more convincing. Several laboratory experiments have suggested lower temperatures

305

are associated with increased survival of the virus (Casanova et al. 2010). Sajadi and

306

colleagues concluded that the early spread of COVID-19 was consistent with the

307

behavior of a seasonal respiratory by examining the global spread of the COVID-19

308

(Sajadi et al. 2020). Many recent investigations also demonstrated a positive association

309

between cold temperature and COVID-19 risk. For example, an epidemiologic study

310

with 122 Chinese cities estimated a positive association with a 4.86% increase in the

311

daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases for each 1 °C rise when temperatures

312

below 3 °C (Xie and Zhu 2020).

313
314

In addition, another possible explanation for the association change in the pandemic

315

period could be the adaptation of societies to cold temperature (Gasparrini et al. 2017;

316

Schwartz et al. 2015). Specifically, the variation of temperature-mortality association

317

mainly depends on the combination of two pathways: an intrinsic adaptation by a

318

physiological acclimatisation response, and the extrinsic adaptation due to non-climate

319

driven factors such as socioeconomic and demographic conditions and public health

320

services (Achebak et al. 2020; Vicedo-Cabrera et al. 2018). Especially for the early

321

days of the COVID-19 outbreak, extrinsic factors such as the health-care resource

322

availability could play an important role in the change of the vulnerability. The rapid

323

surge of COVID-19 cases has posed a serious threat to the Italian national health system

324

(Remuzzi and Remuzzi 2020). Because of the lack of medical resources (Ji et al. 2020)

325

and reorganization of the health care systems to the enormous increase in acutely

326

COVID-19 patients, some patients died at home while awaiting admission (Emanuel et

327

al. 2020), which might be caused by cold temperatures (Achebak et al. 2019; Yang et

328

al. 2017). For example, there was a significant decrease in the rate of hospital admission

329

for acute coronary syndrome and acute myocardial infarction during the early stage of

330

the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy (De Filippo et al. 2020; De Rosa et al. 2020).

331
332

On the other hand, further important consideration is that the adverse psychosocial

333

effects of pandemics (Guessoum et al. 2020) may be related to the individuals’ intrinsic
16

334

physiological and psychological vulnerability to cold temperature. For example,

335

research revealed that social exclusion could make people feel cold (Zhong and

336

Leonardelli 2008). Several studies also observed that ambient temperatures are

337

associated with the increase in emergency department visits for mental illness, suicides,

338

and self-reported days of poor mental health (Mullins and White 2019; Xue et al. 2019).

339

Restrictive social containment measures (including stay-at-home orders, quarantine,

340

and isolation) may exacerbate the adverse psychological outcomes and mental disorders,

341

resulting in excess cold-related mortality (Pfefferbaum and North 2020).

342
343

We also investigated the discrepancy effects by sex and age groups in the pandemic.

344

The difference in temperature-related mortality between sex and age groups may be

345

largely driven by a thermoregulatory pathway. Some studies suggested that men have

346

larger decreases in core body temperature when exposed to cold, and thus are more

347

susceptible to cold than women, whereas other studies reported the opposite (Achebak

348

et al. 2019; Moghadamnia et al. 2017). The ability to maintain body temperature for

349

males and females may differ with health and socioeconomic conditions

350

(Moghadamnia et al. 2017). With regards to the age-specific differences in

351

thermoregulatory during exposure to cold temperature, older people generally respond

352

with reduced peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased metabolic heat production in

353

comparison with younger individuals (Achebak et al. 2019; Stocks et al. 2004).

354

Additionally, multiple factors other than physiological mechanisms could explain the

355

discrepancies in pandemic cold-related mortality between different age groups. One

356

possible explanation for the pronounced gap in the RRs between the 65-74 age group

357

and other older groups is the health-related behaviours. For example, the older

358

individuals may be more concerned about their vulnerability of COVID-19 infection

359

and are more willing to conduct personal protection measures such as wearing masks

360

and staying indoors and thus avoid direct to cold exposures and infectious diseases.

361
362

There are some limitations in this study. First, we did not include the analysis of the

363

disease-specific mortality because the data was not available. Therefore, we did not

364

know the extent of the temperature impact on certain disease-specific mortality in the

365

pandemic. An additional limitation is that this is an ecological study without individual

366

data. Therefore, exposure misclassification is a potential concern. For example, the

367

aggregated ambient temperature at a province-level does not necessarily remain

368

consistent for individuals, specifically for people who may reduce the cold exposure

369

because of keeping the stay-at-home orders during the pandemic. Furthermore, we were

370

unable to make any inference in terms of the possible mechanism pathways governing

371

the association between cold exposure and excess mortality in the pandemic.

372
373

In conclusion, our findings suggest that COVID-19 pandemic increased the impacts of

374

cold temperatures on mortality in Italy. This means that using the historical exposure-

375

response relationship between temperature and mortality may underestimate the health

376

impacts of cold temperatures during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, no sign shows

377

the end of the COVID-19 pandemic before the widespread use of vaccines. Some

378

restrictive social containment measures may continually affect our life and behaviour

379

in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we would expect our findings enable public health

380

agencies to take early actions such as making preparedness for indoor temperature

381

control, developing early cold warning systems, and giving special attention to the

382

vulnerable group, to avoid the unexpected cold-related excess mortality in the next

383

coming winter.
