Abstract
Mathematical modeling of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) of COVID-19
in Kenya is presented. An SEIR compartment model is considered with additional
compartments of hospitalized population whose condition is severe or critical and
also the fatalities compartment. The basic reproduction number (R0 ) is computed
by next generation matrix approach and later expressed as a time-dependent function so as to incorporate the NPIs into the model. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved using fourth-order and fifth-order
Runge-Kutta methods. Different intervention scenarios are considered and results
show that, implementation of closure of education insitutions, curfew and partial
lockdown yield predicted delayed peaks of the overall infections, severe cases and
fatalities and subsequently containement of the pandemic in the country.

Keywords: Basic reproduction number, COVID-19, SEIR, NPIs.

1 Introduction
On 7th January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported novel severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus causative of the COVID19, [4]. The WHO report, details the chrolonology of how Wuhan in Hubei Province
in China became a global epicenter of COVID-19 with the epidemiological link to the
Huanan Seafood wet markets where there was sale of live animals. Over the period,
COVID-19 has infected close to 3 million people worldwide with close to 200,000 fatalities reported, necessitating the WHO to declare it a pandemic. With no viable vaccine
at the moment, COVID-19 has initiated efforts focussed on containement and strategies aimed at reducing infections and fatalities. On the global platform, there has been
a furor of activity in determining the best strategy in containment of the COVID-19

pandemic. A host of countries have insituted interventions not limited to social distancing, curfews and total lockdowns. In [3], a model taking into consideration BatsHosts-Reservoir-People transmission network was implemented, where reproduction
numbers (RO ) were computed to determine the transmissibility of the virus between
people and reservoirs. The value of RO of reservoir to people was found to be 2.30
while people to people was 3.5. In [11], they delved into mathematical models of the
COVID-19 and with a reproduction number of 2, they considered an SEI model to
model the effects of local social gatherings. With a 14-day infectious period, the model
showed that with 18 hours exposure, the attendees of the event had a protection efficacy of 70%. In [8], a conceptual SEIR model to gauge the effects of individual reaction
and goverment reactions was investigated. This was in line with Chinese government
implementation of social distancing measures in areas considered as epicenters. The
model incorporated zoonotic introductions and emigrations and showed that close
relations with reported cases, even though asymptomatic transmission could not be
established. In Ontario, Canada, [13] implemented a mathematical model for transmission and mitigation strategies. They considered measures taken in the population
which included quarantine, isolation of infectious cases and hospitalization with intensive case unit (ICU) cases. It was reported that in absence of substantial physical
social distancing and enhanced case detection and isolation , the ICU resources will be
quickly overwhelmed. In [1], considered a model for prediction of new cases ad made
a comparison study of United States of America, India and Italy. Different scenarions
under physical distancing measures such as lockdown were considered and predictions were made using the available data. It was reported that, without mitigation of
physical interaction of the populations, the peaks of infections will be realised much
earlier in all the three countries.
Of late the modeling efforts have advanced to cater for age-structured modelling
to determine the transmission across different age stratas. In [12], they use an agestructured SIR model with social contact matrices from surveys and Bayesian imputation to gauge the spread of COVID-19 epidemic in India, where they use a generalization of the time dependent RO case study data, age distribution and social contact
structure. Their predictions implore on the duration of social distancing mitigation
such lockdowns and give scope of when periodic ease of the lockdowns can be implemented. Further age-structured morbidity and mortality is reduced on implementation of these measures. [5] investigated a more complex variant of the SEIR referred
to as θ-SEIHRD model to take into account the undetected infections and based their
study in China. Their study showed that mitigation measures of limiting physical
contact decrease the basic reproduction number and subsequently a reduction in infections. Further brisk detection is needed in order to reduce the number of infections.
In [6], results of social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic are
presented. They simulate the reduction of reproduction numbers as a result of social
distancing measures. In [7], an important parameter referred to as the identification
parameter is included in the simulations to predict the peaks of the epidemic in Japan.
This parameter is the ratio between the positive cases to the number of tests performed.
Further they used available date and the least-square based procedure with Poisson
noise to estimate the infection rate as a function of the identification rate and they consider an SEIR compartmental model. They report that, interventions have a positive
effect in delaying the peak of the epidemic and they propose longer interventions to

contain the epidemic.
The results of the researches outlined, provide techniques knowledge on implemeting a mathematical model for the epidemic in Kenya. Recently, [2] outline the forecast
of the scale of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya. In the study they investigate the dissimilarities between China and Kenya interms of the demographics and geography.
They forecasted the potential incidence rate and magnitude of the epidemic using observed growth rate and age-distribution of confirmed cases in China. They reported
that the number of the infected cases is likely to be high and that isolation of the asymptomatic infectious population will not be enough measure. Further they proposed exceptional social distancing to ’flatten the curve’ and caution on the expected rebound
of infections when the restrictions are lifted. In [9], an SEIR model was implemented
taking into consideration the population’s interaction with the enviroment. This was
achieved by considering the enviroment as the host of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the absence of social distancing, transmission and spread of COVID-19 was rife.
As at 7th May 2020, Kenya had performed 28,002 tests, with 607 confirmed positive of COVID-19, 197 recoveries and 29 fatalities, [10]. The country’s peak is not yet
predicted and in this paper , we investigate a variant of the SEIR model to predict
the peaks of the infections, severity of the ill and fatalities with and without the nonpharmaceutical measures.

2 Model formulation
To model the mitigation efforts to curb the transmission and spread of COVID-19, we
use the compartmental Susceptibles-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model. We consider
human-human transmission and divide the human population N at a time t into eight
compartments. The susceptible population is denoted by S(t), the exposed population
by E(t), the asymptomatic infectious population by A(t), the mild symptomatic population by M(t), the population who are severe and hospitalised by H (t), the critically
ill population in the intensive care unit (ICU) by C (t), the recovered population by R(t)
and the fatalities by D (t). Hence the total human population is given as
N ( t ) = S ( t ) + E ( t ) + A ( t ) + M ( t ) + H ( t ) + C ( t ) + D ( t ) + R ( t ).

(2.1)

S(t) is the human population in Kenya that maybe infected with (SARS-CoV-2) virus.
The susceptibles move to E(t) after incubation period to the onset of the disease. The
exposed individuals move to either either asymptomatic A(t) or the mild symptomatic
M (t). Assuming the population in the asymptomatic have ’immunocompetency’, they
move to R(t). The population from M (t) can move either to R(t) or if their conditions
deteriorate warranting hospitalization they move to H (t) and are considered severe.
The severe population on assessment can move to critical compartment C (t) and if
their condition improve and become less critical, they are referred back to the general
ward as severe cases. Further on improved conditions they recover and move to R(t).
The population in C (t) who succumb move to the D (t).
On 13th March 2020, after the first confirmed case, the Government of Kenya (GOK)
instituted measures towards addressing the spread and transmission of COVID-19.
The measures and interventions initially include a dusk-dawn curfew and massive
campaign and sensitization measures of social and physical distancing. On 6th April

2020, the GOK extend and upscaled these measures with partial lockdowns in towns
considered as hotspots in Kenya. These measures constituted enabled formulation of
assumptions for development of the mathematical model. We assume the following;1. The disease is transmitted through human-human transmissions. There are no
cross-infection occurring from pathogens in the environment nor human-animal
transmissions.
2. Susceptible (S) individuals are exposed/infected through contact with infectious
individuals. Each infectious individual causes an average R0 secondary infections.
3. After an average incubation period of 5.1 days, exposed (E) individuals either become asymptomatic (A) or exhibit mild infections (M), but not all infected person
exhibit symptoms.
4. The virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period.
5. Individuals with mild infection either recover (R) or worsens to a severe case (H).
6. Individuals with severe infection either recover (R) or worsens to a critical case
(C).
7. Critically ill individuals either return to regular hospital or die.
8. Demographics such as birth, death rates and immigration were not considered.
9. Only a fraction of infective individuals can be identified by diagnosis.
10. An infected individual acquires immunity upon recovery.

The terms 1N and 2N describe the rate at which the susceptible population are
infected by the asymptomatic population and the mild symptomatic respectively.
In order to gauge the extent of the spread of COVID-19, experts have recommended
extensive testing in the populations but due to economic constaints in the country and
globally this testing has been below par. Therefore, many countries have resulted to
introducing a wide range of NPIs to atleast slow down the epidemic spread as they
gather resources for mass testing and isolation of confirmed cases. In order to simulate
and predict infection cases from the model, we use the framework developed by [7]. In
this case it is assumed only a fraction of the infected individuals are identified by the
diagnosis. This fraction is given by p and it is referred to as the identification parameter
which is 0 < p < 1. For this study p is calculated as the ratio of the confirmed cases
to the tests performed. Its usage in this study is as follows: suppose S + E + A + M +

Existence of a disease free equilibrium(DFE)
To determine the DFE of the COVID-19 in Kenya we solve the system of equations
(2.2) after equating the right hand side of the system to zeros. In this case A = 0, M =
0, H = 0 and subsequently C = 0, R = 0 and D = 0, which yields a DFE point as

( N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) .

We compute the basic reproduction number RO at DFE using the next generation approach. Let x = ( E, A, M) T and dx

Existence of Endemic Equilibrium Point(EE)
The endemic equilibrium point of the model (2.2) is determined as positive steady state
in which the COVID-19 is said to persist in a given population.
Theorem 1. The COVID-19 model has a unique endemic equuilibrium point when R0 > 1
otherwise the endemic equilibrium doesn’t exist.
Proof. Suppose that (S∗ , E∗ , A∗ , M∗ , H ∗ , C ∗ , R∗ , D ∗ ) is a non-trivial equilibrium
point of (2.2). The equilibrium (S∗ , E∗ , A∗ , M∗ , H ∗ , C ∗ , R∗ , D ∗ ) is determined by solving

Prediction of infection cases
In the quest to determine the level of preparedness to curb spread of COVID-19, it is
important to predict future numbers of daily infection cases and cumulative infections.
This provides a basis for policy makers to know when the available healthcare infrastructure is likely to be overwhelmed. In this section, we used a Metropolis-HastingsMarkov-Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for non-linear Gaussian functions to
estimate the daily and cumulative cases from the Kenya’s data of daily confirmed
cases. Using 20,000 iterations of MCMC procedure we are able to predict the daily
infection cases and the cumulative infections for a period of 90 days.
Using the available daily data of the COVID-19 cases, [10], we are able to use these
procedures to predict the daily infection cases as seen in Figure 2a and when the country is likely to have reported the first 1000 infection cases from Figure 2b.

3 Simulation and Results
In this section, we report on the results of simulations of COVID-19 model. The model’s
equation 2.2 that are solved using a fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta method, which
is implemented in MATLAB. We consider N = 4.76 × 107 people which is Kenya’s
total population as per the 2019 census. The simulations are done using the parameters listed in Table (1). The human-human contact reduction measures we consider
are school closedown, dusk to dawn curfew and partial lockdowns in towns and cities
perceived as COVID-19 hotspots. The essence of contact reduction is to mitigate the
interaction between the susceptible and infectious populations. Based on studies of
COVID-19 spread in China, Italy, and Spain, we suppose that if no mitigation measures are in place then an infectious individual would infect three secondary cases, in
his/her interaction sphere. Thus we consider the R0 as 3, for the unmitigated scenario.
The first case of the novel corona virus was confirmed in Kenya on 13th March, 2020.
On 16th March 2020, schools were closed, which was the first NPI that was implemented by the Kenyan government. Then 14 days into the school closedown, curfew
measures were implemented. Thereafter 24 days into school closedown, partial lockdown was implemented. In our simulations, we implement the school closure for 210
days, curfew for 196 days, and partial lockdown for 186 days. This is done via a timedependent Ro, which was taken as a cosine function, see [6]. We presume that school
closure yields a 20% reduction in contact while adding a curfew on to the school closure results to a 40% reduction, and introduction of the partial lockdown on to the
other two NPIs yields a 60% reduction in contacts as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Depiction of the effects of school closedown, curfew and partial lockdown on the
time-dependent basic reproduction number. The duration of school closedown, of 210 days, is
indicated by the cyan color. However, it is overlapped by the duration of curfew implementation, shown here in yellow. The yellow region is in turn overlapped by the gray region which
represents the duration of partial lockdown implementation.

A reduction in R0 implies that fewer individuals are being infected and hence the
disease spread is slowed down .
In Figures 4a and 4b, we report on the simulation of infections and the cumulative
infections under different scenarios. These different scenarios are when there is no
any mitigation, when the schools are closed, when schools are closed and dusk-dawn
curfew is instituted and when schools are closed, curfew in place and partial lockdown
is in place.

Figure 4: The simulated daily cases of infected individuals is shown in a), whereby the duration
of NPIs implementation is also indicated by the colored regions. The cumulative cases of the
infected individuals is depicted in b). The NPIs are shown to effectively mitigate the spread
of the epidemic in the population. A combination of the three measures is the most effective
strategy in that even though a new wave of infection emerges, it flattens out with a much lower
peak.

From the figures we deduce that, the NPIs instituted aid in containment of the epidemic spread, resulting to fewer people being infected as compared to the unmitigated
scenario. In particular, we see a much higher peak of infections in the unmitigated scenario, which arrives much faster due to the high rate of infections when R0 =3.0. For
the first two NPIs the infections peaks are lower and come at a later date. When all the
three NPIs are combined, resulting to a R0 of 1.2, the infections peak at a much lower
value and the epidemic begins to subside. However, this leaves a large population in
the susceptible compartment such that when the value of R0 begins to rise, towards
the end of the NPI duration, a rebound of infections occurs. Due to the effectiveness
of the combined NPIs the new peak is much lower and the epidemic is eradicated.
The measures results to a reduction in the cumulative number of infections, see Figure
4b. Combining all the three NPIs leads to a significant delay of the epidemic spread,
a time the health system can utilize to put mechanisms and facilities to respond to the
epidemic appropriately.
In Figures 5a and 5b, we report on the number of severe cases of COVID-19 who are
hospitalized. Reduction of the severe cases is important as this represents proportion of
the population who are directly utilizing the healthcare facilities at a given time. Due to
limited hospital infrastructure and resources, delay of this peak is vital for the health
systems to prepare for a guaranteed influx of patients in need of medical attention.
Furthermore, any reduction of the hospitalized results in significant reduction of severe
cases transfer to critical cases that require ICU services .

Figure 5: Over the duration of the implementation of the NPIs, the daily severe cases are shown
in (a) where the duration of these interventions is indicated by the colored region. In (b), the
cumulative severe cases for the three mitigation measures are shown. It shows that, the implementation of the three measures lead to a reduced number of severe cases.

From the Figures 5a and 5b, we deduce that strigent implementation of the NPIs
is key in ensuring the available hospital infrastructure is not overwhelmed during the
epidemic. The national goverment and county goverments under the Health ministry
directive have boosted the bed capacity at all hospital levels, including establishing isolation centers. If schools are closed, curfew implemented and lockdown instituted, the
simulation shows that the hospitalized population may not overwhelm the established
healthcare infrastructure capacity.
In Figures 6a and 6b, we present the results of simulations of fatalities under different intervention scenarios.

Figure 6: The simulated daily number of fatalities is shown in (a), where the duration of the
NPIs is indicated by the colored region. The cumulative number of the fatalities is presented in
(b). In the event all three mititgation measures are in place, the cumulative cases ’plateau’ at a
much lower peak.

Obviously, fatalities from COVID-19 will have the highest peak if NPIs are not instituted. From the Figure 6a, delayed peaks are realised if the NPIs are in place and the
best scenario is if the considered measures are combined, for the considered duration
of implementation. A rebound of infections also results to a resurgence of fatalities due
to the severity of the disease, especially among the older population.

Conclusion
Since COVID-19 vaccine development will take significantly longer period of time before it becomes globally available, it is imperative on all medical sectors in the country
to adhere to mitigation measures and intervention policies set by the government. The
implementation of school closure, dusk to dawn curfew and partial lockdown are the
mitigation effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19 that are effective and lead to
the flattening of the curve within the duration of implementation. Relaxation of the
mitigation measures on or before September 2020 will likely lead to a resurgence and
the country may experience a new wave of infections. Devoid of the aftershocks of
these interventions, the country will have no infections as at 31st December 2020.
