ABSTRACT
Background: Effective management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) requires large-scale testing. Collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) by healthcare workers (HCW)
is currently used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, which increases the risk of transmission to HCWs. Selfadministered saliva and buccal swabs are convenient, painless and safe alternative sample collection
methods.
Methods: A cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 participants who were tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days. A self-collected saliva and buccal swab and a
HCW-collected NPS were obtained. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed and
cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained. Positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent
agreement (NPA) and overall agreement (OA) were calculated for saliva and buccal swabs, as
compared with NPS.
Results: Among the 42 participants, 73.8% (31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 tests. With
reference to NPS, the saliva test had PPA 66.7%, NPA 91.7% and OA 69.0%. The buccal swab had PPA
56.7%, NPA 100% and OA 73.8%. Presence of symptoms improved diagnostic accuracy. There was no
statistically significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset within the first
12 days of symptoms for all three modalities.
Conclusion: Self-collected saliva tests and buccal swabs have only moderate agreement with HCWcollected NPS swabs. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva test or buccal
swab, with a negative test warranting a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives. This combined
strategy minimizes discomfort and reduces the risk of spread to the community and HCWs.

BACKGROUND
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in December 2019 [1]. In March 2020, COVID-19 was
declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation.
One of the main reasons for the high rate of transmission is the significant proportion of asymptomatic
but infective carriers. Hence safe and effective detection of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients through
appropriate large-scale testing is of paramount importance.
As the clinical symptoms COVID-19 patients experience are often nonspecific, the current method of
detection relies heavily on molecular techniques. It is recommended that samples for testing are
obtained from the upper respiratory tract rather than lower respiratory tract [2]. These include
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), the current standard test, as well as oropharyngeal swabs, saliva
specimen, and nasal aspirates.
The accuracy of COVID-19 detection varies according to the viral load in the different respiratory tract
samples. In the first 14 days after onset of illness, SARS-CoV-2 was most reliably detected in sputum
samples, which contained the highest viral load, followed by nasal swabs [3, 4]. There are several
disadvantages of the NPS, which is considered the current standard test “gold-standard” test in most
settings. Firstly, NPS can only be performed by trained HCWs. The patient needs to travel to the
swabbing facility which increases the risk of community spread. Secondly, to perform the swab, the
medical staff must be in close contact with the patient. Coughing or retching by the patient could
produce a large number of aerosolised droplets, increasing the risk of HCW transmission [5]. Thirdly,
this increases the burden on the currently heavily strained healthcare system by diverting a lot of
resources to the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, a significant proportion of suspect cases who
reside in the community are asymptomatic and are only called up for testing as a result of contact
tracing from a confirmed COVID-19 case and hence are unlikely to present for testing. Hence, our

group seeks to validate diagnostic tests which can be performed by the patient at home, and if
validated, may have comparable concordance to NPS.
In instances where an NPS is not possible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recommend a HCW-collected oropharyngeal specimen as other
alternatives. Indeed, active viral replication in the upper respiratory tract of young to middle-aged
patients with mild cases of COVID-19 has been demonstrated previously, with peak viral shedding
during the first week of symptoms [6]. There is also emerging evidence to suggest that supervised selfcollected oral fluid specimens perform similarly to HCW-collected NPS specimens for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 infection [7].
In order to validate the use of buccal swabs and saliva specimen as alternative diagnostic tests for
SARS-CoV-2, our group performed a cross-sectional study of NPS, self-collected buccal swabs and
saliva specimens collected concurrently in order to determine the positive percent agreement (PPA),
negative percent agreement (NPA), overall agreement (OA), positive and negative predictive values.
The advantage of self-collected buccal swabs or saliva specimen is two-fold, 1) facilitates specimen
collection without patients leaving their home, thus improving compliance and ease of collection, and
2) reduces the risk of community spread and transmission to HCWs. This would revolutionize the
management of SARS-CoV-2, where suspect cases can send in a specimen for testing without
breaching quarantine notice, and thus increase detection rates without compromising the safety of
others.

METHODS
Setting and participants
A cross-sectional single centre study was conducted on 42 individuals who were previously tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 via NPS within the past 7 days, and who were isolated at the Singapore
General Hospital (SGH). SGH is the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore and is one of the main referral
hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients.
The inclusion criteria were participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by NPS, between the
ages of 21-80 years. Patients who were unable to produce oral secretions for self-collection were
excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained. This study was approved by the
institution’s ethics review board (CIRB Ref No 2020/2655).
Demographic, clinical data collection and survey on patient experience
Sociodemographic data and symptoms at time of sampling were obtained via a questionnaire
administered by a study team member, and through review of medical records. After sample
collection was complete, the patient’s experience was surveyed. They were asked to select the test
that best fit each of the following qualities: 1) comfort 2) convenience and 3) personal preference.
Sample collection and processing
A saliva, buccal and NPS sample was obtained from each participant in that order. For the saliva
specimen, participants were asked to cough deeply five times and pool saliva in their mouth for 1-2
minutes prior to collection, and gently spit 1-2 mL of saliva into a 60 mL sterile closed-top plastic
collection container (BMH.921406, Biomedia, Singapore). Subsequently, for the buccal sample,
participants were asked to pool any phlegm or secretions in their mouth, rub the swab (300264,
Deltalab, Spain) on both cheeks, above and below the tongue, both gums, and on the hard palate for
a total of 20 seconds to ensure the swab was saturated with oral fluid. The swab was then placed in

the tube with the lid secured. Finally, the NPS (MSC-96000-ST, Miraclean, China) was collected by a
trained HCW for all patients, as per standard hospital protocol [8]. All swabs were processed in 1ml of
lysis buffer (Cobas Omni Lysis Reagent, P/N 06997538190) and in-house RT-PCR was performed on all
specimens based on protocol by Corman et al [9]. The results for SARS-CoV-2, including the E-gene
cycle threshold (CT) values, were correlated to that for the NPS. All signals that crossed the detection
threshold were considered a positive test.
Statistical analysis
Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney test was applied to continuous variables as appropriate, and
Fisher’s exact test was applied to categorical variables. Results of the saliva and buccal swabs were
individually compared to the NPS and the positive percentage agreement (PPA), negative percentage
agreement (NPA), overall agreement (OA), positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive
values (NPV) were calculated. CT values between the saliva and buccal swabs with NPS were analysed
with the paired t-test. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics Version 20.0 (IBM Corp,
Armonk, NY, USA).

RESULTS
All the patients who met the inclusion criteria were recruited. Among 42 participants who previously
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) within the preceding 7 days, 73.8%
(31/42) tested positive via any one of the 3 swab tests. Table 1 shows the baseline demographics
between those who tested positive or negative, for the three diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, namely
NPS, buccal and saliva (Table 1). Participants who remained NPS positive at the time of study
recruitment were younger, and more likely to be symptomatic (Table 1). The survey of participant
experience showed that 59.5% (25/42) participants ranked the buccal swab as the most preferred,
most convenient, as well as most comfortable to collect. A total of 40.5% (17/42) participants chose
the saliva test as the most preferred, convenient, and comfortable means for first-line SARS-CoV-2
testing. Only one participant ranked NPS as most preferable (1/42), while none of the them felt that
it was convenient or comfortable.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort as diagnosed using NPS was 71.4% (n=30/42). With
reference to the NPS, the buccal swab had a PPA of 56.7%, NPA of 100%, OA of 73.8%, PPV of 100%
and NPV of 48% (Table 2A). Viral load was lower in the buccal specimen, with the mean CT value for
the buccal swab being higher than NPS (27.19 ± 2.48 vs 21.66 ± 5.60, p < 0.001) (Figure 1A). With
reference to the NPS, the saliva sample had a PPA of 66.7%, NPA of 91.7%, OA of 69.0%, PPV of 95.2%
and NPV of 52.4% (Table 2B). There was no difference in CT values between saliva and NPS specimens
(25.77 ± 5.60 vs 22.95 ± 6.03, p = 0.057), suggesting a similar viral load in both samples (Figure 1B).
Presence of symptoms at the time of swab collection was associated with better diagnostic accuracy.
53.3% of symptomatic participants tested positive by both NPS and buccal swab (p = 0.017), while
63.3% were positive by both NPS and saliva sample (p = 0.004) (Table 3). There was no statistically
significant association between CT values and duration of symptom onset, for all three diagnostic
modalities (Figure 2). Comparison of CT values for the paired NP, saliva and buccal swabs are shown
in Figure 3.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown that saliva tests and buccal swabs were comparable to each other and
were in moderate agreement with NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with PPA between 56 and 66%
and PPV 95 to 100%. On the other hand, both saliva tests and buccal swabs performed comparably to
NPS in detecting negative cases, with an NPA of 90 to 100%. Overall, they were moderately
comparable to NPS with an OA of 69 to 74%. This paves the way for larger validation studies to support
the use of self-collected saliva tests or buccal swabs, without the risk of community spread or spread
to HCW.
Most coronaviruses are known to replicate in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. The viral
shedding pattern in SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be similar to that of the influenza virus, with peak
viral shedding in the first week of illness [6, 10]. NPS has been shown to have better diagnostic
accuracy compared to oropharyngeal swab [10-12], and it has been recommended as the gold
standard diagnostic modality. However, there is emerging evidence alluding to similar detection rates
with alternative sample collection methods that may be feasible and safe, including saliva, posterior
oropharyngeal saliva, and throat washing.
Self-collected saliva offers a promising prospect for sample collection. This is due to its relative
convenience, comfort and subjective participant preference compared to the NPS. It is also less costly
and quicker to obtain [13], with the additional benefit of decreased risk of transmission to HCWs,
making it a convenient and safe means of mass testing. There is increasing evidence that the viral load
in saliva is comparable or higher than that in the nasopharynx [4, 14-16]. We have shown that the CT
values were comparable between saliva and NPS, representing a similar viral load in both samples. A
longitudinal study in Korea showed that the highest viral load was in the nasopharynx, but also
remarkably high in the saliva, and was detected in the saliva up to day 6 of hospitalization and day 9
of illness [4]. Azzi et al reported a high overall concordance rate of 97.4% between NPS and saliva, and
also showed that there were no statistically significant difference between viral loads of the two

samples [15, 17]. Our results also showed a high PPV of 95.2% compared to NPS, the current standard
diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. However, the low PPA of 66.7% may limit its suitability to replace NPS
as the gold standard diagnostic test. Existing studies have also shown varying PPA or concordance
rates, when comparing saliva detection rates to NPS, with reported positive concordance rates ranging
from 45.6% [14] to 94.8% [18]. The vast differences in concordance rates may be due to limitations in
sample collection. The lower PPA might also be limited by the amount and sample collection technique
of the saliva test. Moreover, considering the similar viral load between saliva and NPS, this further
supports that poor sample collection technique might be the reason leading to some saliva tests being
completely negative. Unfortunately, our study did not investigate the quality of the saliva produced.
Kojima et al observed that there were differences in positive detection rates between clinician
supervised vs unsupervised self-collected saliva tests and NPS, which further supports that collection
technique plays a big role in the positive detection rates [7]. Another possible explanation is the
duration from diagnosis to sample collection. Wyllie et al has shown that a higher percentage of saliva
samples remained positive up to 10 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis compared to NPS (81% vs
71%)[19], which is a result supported by other studies [20, 21]. Although our results show a nonsignificant relationship between interval after symptom onset and sample collection, other studies
have shown a possibility that NP and saliva are most equivalent early in the illness compared to those
collected beyond the first week [22]. Not surprisingly, the presence of symptoms increased the PPA
for saliva compared to NPS (79.2%, 19/24). Overall, these findings provide supporting evidence for
recommending saliva as an alternative modality that is safer, more comfortable and convenient to
collect, and sufficiently accurate for making a clinical diagnosis.
There are very few studies evaluating the use of buccal swabs, with conflicting results between studies
[7, 22, 23]. Our results show that the buccal swab performs less accurately than NPS due to its lower
PPA rate of 56.7%. It also has a lower viral load as reflected in the significantly higher CT value obtained.
However, participants in our study ranked it as the most convenient, comfortable and preferred test.

Thus, buccal swabs may have a role in specific populations who might not be able to spontaneously
produce saliva, such as in young children and older patients [23].
The correlation of detection rates and symptoms still remains controversial. Zou et al showed that
viral load in asymptomatic patients was similar to symptomatic patients with NPS and throat swabs
[10], while Chau et al showed that viral loads were equivalent in symptomatic patients, but lower in
asymptomatic patients in saliva [24]. We showed that none of the tests showed evident association
with duration of symptom onset. However, symptomatic patients were more likely to be true positive
on both the buccal swab and saliva test.
Taken together, buccal and saliva samples have moderate agreement with NPS, and are reasonable
alternatives to the current gold standard NPS for diagnosis of COVID-19. In view of the comparable
viral load, high PPV and OA, moderate PPA, and greater patient comfort and convenience, we
recommend that the initial screening NPS be replaced with a saliva test or buccal swab for community
testing. If the result is positive, we can assume that the patient is truly SARS-CoV-2 positive, due to
their high PPV when compared to NPS. If negative, we should perform a confirmatory NPS before
discharging the patient, to mitigate the moderate PPA value to ensure they are truly COVID-negative
(Figure 4). This workflow is time and resource-saving, especially in the context of mass screening
strategies where resources, in particular HCWs, are scarce. In this context, saliva tests or buccal swabs
can easily increase testing rates due to their ease of collection, without further straining the
healthcare system. The requirement for a confirmatory NPS for negative cases combines the
sensitivity of NPS with the high NPA of buccal and saliva samples, while saving cost, minimizing
discomfort and reducing the risk of spread to the community and to HCWs.
Our study has several strengths. Firstly, we were able to obtain self-collected specimens for buccal
swab and saliva samples, testing the feasibility of widespread application in the community with saliva
tests and buccal swabs being more acceptable to patients than NPS. Secondly, we were also able to
recruit a variety of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at various stages of their disease.

However, our study does have several limitations. Firstly, our sample size was relatively small. We
have only included patients who previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, limiting its generalizability
to population screening. Participants were also recruited up to a week after first testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 PCR, thus resulting in 26.2% who were negative on all three specimen samples. We also
limited our study to the adult population. Chong et al has shown that saliva tests might not be useful
in the paediatric population [25], which might limit its use as a population screening test. Even though
the samples were self-collected, they were still conducted in the context of a healthcare setting and
under the supervision of a HCW. Thus, the performance of the tests may be overestimated. Hence,
larger validation studies need to be performed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients
before buccal and saliva samples can be routinely recommended in the clinical setting.
CONCLUSION
Saliva and buccal swabs were comparable to each other and were in moderate agreement with NPS
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Both saliva and buccal swabs had greater patient preference in terms
of comfort and convenience. Primary screening for SARS-CoV-2 may be performed with a saliva or
buccal test. A negative test warrants a confirmatory NPS to avoid false negatives. Buccal swabs might
be considered in the context of specific cohorts where spontaneous saliva production might be
difficult. These self-collection methods represent feasible alternatives that could help reduce the
discomfort experienced by patients, save costs, and reduce the risk of community spread and spread
to HCWs. Larger trials should be conducted to determine the generalizability of these tests in both the
symptomatic and asymptomatic population before they could be used for large scale community
testing.
