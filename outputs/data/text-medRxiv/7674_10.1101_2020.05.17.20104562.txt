COVID 19 in Bangladesh: Assumption of
possible infection and death
Author: Sadik Hasan Shuvo1
Abstract: It is a painful job to predict the death of people. But sometimes it is
important to predict the future and concern the government. A furious future is
waiting for Bangladesh.
nd
Objective: Objective of the study is to assume the number of positive case and
death till 30th December, 2020 in Bangladesh.
s.
Study design: This study was designed with systematic review and data analysis.
Method: The study was completed by analyzing data available on website. First
rst
COVID 19 case in Bangladesh was identified on 8th March. Analyzing the data
ta
increasing rate/common ratio of infection and death has been identified. Then
en
this common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series (at
decreasing rate). Data of China, Iran, Italy and the USA was also analyzed to
assume how the death and case number increased. Social issues of Bangladesh
sh
were also analyzed. Considering all these the assumption was made.
Result: It has been assumed that by the 43rd week (on 30th December, 2020) of
first identification the total case can be 15640747 and total death can be 638769
69
by 30 December, 2020. As this is an assumption this can be true, partially true or
false. But the base of assumption is strong enough so the possibility of being true
ue
or nearly true is higher.
wo
Policy Suggestion: Government should choose properly one between two
options. Either government should declare curfew or let people lead normal life
ife
for the purpose of herd immunity. A very weak lockdown for a long time doesn’t
n’t
make any sense.
Key word: Infection, death, rate, Bangladesh, COVID 19

1.1. Introduction: Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to COVID 19
in the world. Till 20th May 386 people died and total case is 26738i. Just 10 week ago on 8th
March first COVID 19 patient was identified and first death case was on 18th Marchii. Since then
the number of both positive case and death is increasing. Within a very few time the virus is
showing its devastating behavior in this country. The government has a lot to do still now but if
they don’t take proper steps what will happen? This article shows an assumption about the
upcoming future. This assumption is not just a mere prediction. It is a mathematical certainty.

1.2. Significance of the study: This study will be helpful for the government and the
policy maker. Still neither the people nor the government is concern enough about the virus. This
study will show them the future with date. This will appear as live data to them and it will help
them to think carefully and be more concern.

1.3. Research Questions:

This study tried to find out the answer of the following

questions.
•

What is the increasing rate of positive case and death?

•

What is waiting for the future?

•

How many people will be affected and how many will die?

•

How the positive case and death number will be increased?

1.4. Methodology of the study: The following sequence shows the incensement of positive
case in every week in Bangladesh.
3+14+39+54+218+1231+3772+7103+11719+17822+26738.......................
The following sequence shows the incensement of death number in every week in Bangladesh.
1+5+6+20+50+120+163+186+269+386.......................
No available arithmetic formula works here as there is no common ratio or common difference
of the increasing number. So author designed a formula to find out the common ratio. Then the
common ratio has been used in the formula of multiplication series to find out the possible
number of positive case and death. The whole process is described here.

First Part: R = (nearest ratios)/n
Second Part: n-th term = N*R^n-1 (Formula of multiplication series)

Simply the sequence is built by multiplying the previous number with common ratio
N= N*R^1-1, N+1=R*N, N+2=R*(N+1), N+3=R*(N+2)..........N+n=R*{N+(n-1)}
Here

R= increasing rate/common factor
N= last known number
y= 2nd last number
x= 3rd last known number
w= 4th last known number
N+1=Unknown 1st number
N+2=Unknown 2nd number
N+3=Unknown 3rd number
................................................
N+n=Unknown n-th number

1.4.1. Explanation of R= increasing rate/common ratio: In multiplication
series R or common ratio (increasing rate) is determined by a formula, r = (n+1)/n. simply it
divides each term by the previous term. But in this case there is no common ratio as it is
increasing in a natural way. In this case mean of the nearest ratios has been considered as “R”
To find out the common ratio the mean formula has been used here. Increasing rate of last four
weeks has been taken. Then the mean of the nearest rates of three weeks have been calculated
and the result has been considered as the common ratio or increasing rate, r.
Data of the last three weeks have been taken as these weeks show a stable difference. For the
COVID 19 positive cases the ratio of last weeks’ are 1.64, 1.52 and 1.50 which are very close to

each other. But the ratios of previous weeks are: 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, 4, 1.9 and 5.6. The ratios in these
weeks are so much fluctuating. So these ratios have been ignored in mean calculation.
Similarity has been found in the ratio of death number. For the death number the ratios of three
weeks’ among last four are 1.4, 1.4, and 1.4 which are same. But the ratios of previous weeks
are: 5, 1.2, 3.3, 1.1 and 6. The ratios in these weeks are so much fluctuating. So these ratios have
been ignored in mean calculation.
It has been found that the common ratio decreases in other countries in every month so the ratio
has also been used in the formula with a decreasing rate. The rate was decreased considering the
current rate and the socio economic condition of Bangladesh.

1.4.2. Calculation of Positive case
Mean ratio,
R= (nearest ratios)/n

Here, 26738/17822= 1.5

N (Positive case of last week)= 26738

17822/11719 = 1.52

Y(Positive case of 2nd last week)= 17822

11719/7103 = 1.65

X(Positive case of 3rd last week)= 11719

Now, (1.52+1.65+1.5)/3 = 1.6

W (Positive case of 4th last week)= 7103

So, R (Common ratio) = 1.6

Now, N (the last known number)

= N*R^n-1 =N*R^1-1= 26738*1.6^0= 26738*1 = 17822

N+1 (First unknown number)

= N*R^2-1 = 26738*1.6^1 = 26738* 1.6

= 42781

N+2 (2nd Unknown number)

= N*R^3-1 = 26738* (1.6)^2

= 68449

N+3 (3rd Unknown number)

= N*R^4-1 =26738* (1.6)^3

= 109519

The possible positive cases have been calculated up to 30th December. (Shown in table 1 and
diagram 1)

1.4.3. Calculation of death number: The death
number was identified in the same way that of
possible positive case identification.
Mean ratio,
R= (nearest ratios)/n
Here, 386/269= 1.4
269/186= 1.4

N (Death in last week)

= 386

163/120 = 1.4

Y (Death in 2nd last week)= 269

Now, (1.4+1.4+1.4)/3 = 1.4

X (Death in 3rd last week)= 186

So, R (Common ratio) = 1.4

W (Death in 4th last week)= 120

Now, N (the last known number) = N*R^n-1 =N*R^1-1= 386*1.3^0= 386*1

= 386

N+1 (First unknown number)= N*R^2-1 = 386*1.4^1 = 386* 1.4

= 540

N+2 (2nd Unknown number)= N*R^3-1 = 386* (1.4)^2

= 757

N+3 (3rd Unknown number)= N*R^4-1 =386* (1.4)^3

= 1059

The possible deaths have been calculated up to 30th December. (Shown in table 2 and diagram 2)

1.4.4. Changes in common ratio:

Data of five countries (Chinaiii, Iraniv, Italyv,

USAvi and Bangladeshvii) has been analyzed. It has been found that both death rate and rate of
positive cases are increasing at a decreasing rate (showed in figure 3 and 4). From this it can be
assumed that the rate of positive case and death in Bangladesh will be increased at a decreasing
rate. The current data shows that in the ninth week the rates in Bangladesh are higher than other
four countries in both death and positive cases. So it can be assumed that though the rates will be
decreased it will not be like other countries. Sometimes it increases also. Increasing and
decreasing depend on many things such as health care, lockdown, awareness etc. Analyzing all
these it can be predicted that both death rate and the rate of infection will be decreased in every
five weeks. The decreasing rates were determined observing the rates of other countries and the
overall condition of Bangladesh.

2. Weakness of the study: It is not possible to predict the future perfectly. Based on
data it can only be assumed. Assumption can be true, partially true or false. But if assumption is
based on data, mathematical formula, social and other context then the possibility of perfection
becomes higher. In this study data of five countries has been analyzed, formula of multiplication
series has been applied and the health, social, political context of Bangladesh has been taken into
consideration. So the possibility of being true of this assumption is higher but not 100%.

3. Policy suggestion:

Government should impose stick lockdown (curfew) or it

should go for herd immunity. But in Bangladesh lockdown is going on and amid of this garments
factories and markets are opened. The number of both positive case and death is increasing
rapidly. Government should take immediate action to tackle the situation.
