Abstract:
From the pandemic scenario of COVID-19 disease cases in all over the world, the outbreak
prediction becomes very complex for the emerging scientifically research. Several epidemiological
mathematical models of spread are increasing day by day to forecast correctly. Here, the classical SIR
modelling approach is carried out to study the different parameters of this model in case of India county.
This type of approach analyzed by considering different governmental lock down measures in India.
There are some assumptions were taken into account for fitting the model in Python simulation in each
lock down scenario. The predicted parameters of SIR model showed some improvement in each case
of lock down in India. The outcome results showed the extreme interventions should be taken to tackle
this type of pandemic situation in near future.

Introduction:
On 3rd December 2019, a new virus came into the picture with 41 patients connected
mysterious pneumonia cases in the big seafood market area of Wuhan city, China country [1]. At that
time, this virus was called SARS-CoV version 2 and after WHO named it as COVID-19 with global
pandemic on 11th March 2020 [2]. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. Now, almost all the parts of the world are
exposed to this virus and since the infectibility of this virus is large, a huge number of people have
already become victim of it [4]. SARS-CoV-2 infection has represented the one of the largest challenges
for humanity. India first reported a COVID-19 case in a student who returned from Wuhan, the capital
Hubei province, China on January 30, 2020 [5]. Figure 1 showed the COVID-19 scenario of World till
31st May 2020 by considering conformed, deaths and recovered cases.

Estimation of parameters of SIR model for INDIA from actual data
set:
For the epidemical mathematical model, there were used of basic model based on compartments
such as:
i.

(Susceptible->Infectible) SI model

ii.

(Susceptible->Infectible-> Susceptible) SIS model and

iii.

(Susceptible->Infectible-> Recovery/Removed) SIR model

In 1927, firstly Kermack and McKendrick proposed a class of compartmental models that
simplified the mathematical modeling of infectious disease transmission. Entitled as SIR model, it is a
set of general equations which explains the dynamics of an infectious disease spreading through a
susceptible population.

Figure 3: Division of population based on SIR model
Essentially, the standard SIR model is a set of differential equations that can suit the Susceptible
(if previously unexposed to the pandemic disease), Infected (if currently colonized by the pandemic
disease), and Removed (either by death or recovery) as follows:
𝑑𝑆
𝛽

𝑑𝐼 𝛽

Here, N=S+I+R, is independent of time t, denotes the total population size [8, 22, 54-56]. India
2020 population is estimated at 1,380,004,385 people at mid-year according to UN data. Therefore, the
value of population size (N) is considered as 1,380,004,385 for the SIR modelling of India [57].

When there is no infection means I+R=0 then putting S≈N in Equation (2), we get

𝐼 = 𝐼0 𝑒 (𝛽−𝛾)𝑡

Then,

Determination of β and m value:
At the onset of infection, almost all population is susceptible i.e. S≈N. So, I(t) first grows
exponentially.

It can be estimate m value by looking at the data on a log-plot and using for example least
squares to fit best-line fit.
In this work, the data set was taken from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard
operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)
database [58]. And, the Python code [59] of SIR model based on dataset of India was simulated on
Google Colab Platform and the estimated futuristic dates are determined through the online date
calculator [60]. Also, the scenario of our World and India based on actual JHU-CSSE data set was
computed through Minitab software [57].
In this study, we assume the governmental protocols of each lockdown measure is
homogeneously implemented across the country. However, because of significant differences in various
socio-economic, demographic, cultural, and administrative level factors, actual transmission rates are
bound to differ from region to region. Hence, the estimated parameters in our study are only valid for
overall predictions of cases in India, on an average, and may fail to trace the dynamics of the epidemic
in sub-regions, say districts or states [14]. The uncertainty in our predictions is large due to many
unknowns arising from model assumptions, population demographics, the number of COVID-19
diagnostic tests administered per day, testing criteria, accuracy of the test results, and heterogeneity in
implementation of different government-initiated interventions and community-level protective
measures across the country. We have neither accounted for age-structure, contact patterns or spatial
information to finesse our predictions nor considered the possibility of a latent number of true cases,
only a fraction of which are ascertained and observed. COVID-19 hotspots in India are not uniformly
spread across the country, and state-level forecasts may be more meaningful for state-level
policymaking. Regardless of the caveats in our study, our analyses show the impact and necessity of
lockdown and of suppressed activity post-lockdown in India. One ideological limitation of considering
only the epidemiological perspective of controlling COVID-19 transmission in our model is the
inability to count excess deaths due to other causes during this period, or the flexibility to factor in
reduction in mortality/morbidity due to some other infectious or flu-like illnesses, traffic accidents or
health benefits of reduced air pollution levels. A more expansive framework of a cost-benefit analysis
is needed as we gather more data and build an integrated landscape of population attributable risks [51].

If it takes t=T Days to recover, then R(T)=I0, then γT=1.
So,

(15)

Then integrating both sides, we get:

𝐼 = −𝑆 +

𝛾

(16)

Where C= Constant Term
Now at the onset of infection, I value of Equation (16) is very small whereas S≈N (Total
Population size).
So, at t=0, we plug in I⁓0 and S⁓N:
Now, from Equation (16),

0 = −𝑁 +

Then,

Putting the value of C of Equation (18) in Equation (16), we get

This equation is then valid for all time. In general, I initially grow exponentially, then reaches
a peak and then gradually decays back to zero value. Now finding out the percentage of sick people at
the peak of infection (Imax) and susceptible people still remaining after the infection of COVID-19 virus
passes. From Equation (2) and (20), which are differential equation and its solution.
Again, to simplify, assume S= Ns, I= Ni and R= Nr. Where, s, i and r represents the fraction of
total susceptible, infected and recovery/removed population. Then,

The percentage of sick people at the peak of infection drastically reduced in each lock down of
India. For finding out Sinf = lim 𝑆(𝑡) i.e. the percentage of susceptible people still remaining after the

infection passes away. We note that i=0, as t tends to infinity (∞) at the end of infection, then the
Equation (21) becomes:

Equation (24) can be solved numerically for s value. Now from the data set of India we got the

The percentage of sick people at the end of infection reduced as per the strict procedures of
lock down and this can be further decreased for future lock down implementations.

Determination of R0:
The special term of basic reproduction number i.e. R0 is the ratio of transmission rate and
recovery rate.

𝑅0 =

(25)

It represents the number of individuals (on average) that a single individual infects [7, 56, 6168]. In terms of R0, we have

The basic reproduction number reduced as per the strict procedures of lock down and this can
be further decreased. The simulation results of Python code of SIR model based on India COVID-19
dataset was shown in Appendix-I (From Figure 6-11) for each lock down cases.

Conclusion:
From study of SIR model for the case of India, several points come into conclusions and these
are described as the betterment of each lock down measures should be taken. The recovery rate is
increasing and the transmission rate is decreasing as a result the value of basic reproduction number is
decreasing by flatten the curve of epidemic spread of COVID-19. Similarly, the percentage of
susceptible people still remaining after the infection passes away decreased in horrible manner and it
should be checked near future. Again, the peak percentage value of infectious people after the sickness
minimized with better values. In case of India, further strict governmental interventions should be
chosen and of course the pandemic scene can be drastically reduced by the heartfully awareness among
residing people.
