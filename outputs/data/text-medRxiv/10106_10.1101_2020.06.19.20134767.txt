Abstract
Background: The number of published clinical practice guidelines and recommendations related to
SARS-CoV-2 infections causing COVID-19 has rapidly increased. However, insufficient consideration of
appropriate methodologies in the guideline development could lead to misleading information,
uncertainty among professionals, and potentially harmful actions for patients.
Purpose: Rapid systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and recommendations in the context
of COVID-19 to explore if basic methodological standards of guideline development have been met.
Data sources: MEDLINE [PubMed], CINAHL [Ebsco], Trip and manual search; from Feb 1st 2020 until
April 27th 2020.
Study selection: All types of healthcare workers providing any kind of healthcare to any patient
population in any setting.
Data extraction: At least two reviewers independently extracted guideline characteristics, conducted
critical appraisal according to The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument
(AGREE II) and classified the guidelines using the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF)
Guidance Manual and Rules for Guideline Development. We plan six-month updates (living review).
Data synthesis: There were 1342 titles screened and 188 guidelines included. The highest average
AGREE II domain score was 89% for scope and purpose, the lowest for rigor of development (25%). Only
eight guidelines (4%) were based on a systematic literature search and a structured consensus process
by representative experts (classified as the highest methodological quality, S3 according to AWMF).
Patients were only included in the development of one guideline. A process for regular updates was
described in 27 guidelines (14%).
Limitations: Methodological focus only.
Conclusions: Despite clear scope, most publications fell short of basic methodological standards of
guideline development. Future research should monitor the evolving methodological quality of the
guidelines and their updates over time.

Introduction
The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide and the number of cases
increased globally at an accelerated rate (1, 2). While measures are essential to mitigate the impact of
the pandemic specifically, we also need immediate and targeted action to continue effective and safe
healthcare generally. Necessary actions to avoid collateral damages to patients range from adapting
healthcare to maximizing safety while providing continuation of usual healthcare to rapidly restart
routine care in the areas where healthcare has been reduced due to mandated lockdowns. Moreover,
healthcare workers in close physical contact with patients could be infected or could be unknowingly
carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus themselves.
Clinical practice guidelines and recommendations are needed to support therapeutic decisions and
provide an essential knowledge source, especially in such a new and challenging situation. Clinical
practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care
which are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms
of alternative care options (3).
The number of published guidelines and recommendations related to COVID-19 has rapidly increased
since February 2020. However, insufficient consideration of appropriate methodologies and rigorous
strategies in the guideline development process could lead to misleading information, uncertainty
among professionals, and potentially harmful actions for patients (4, 5). The aim of our study was
therefore to systematically review and critically appraise clinical practice guidelines and
recommendations related to SARS-CoV-2 infections and the delivery of healthcare in the current
context of COVID-19 from a methodological perspective.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
We performed a rapid systematic review informed by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Interim Guidance
from the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group (6) in collaboration with Cochrane Austria, located

at the Danube University Krems. We will provide regular six-month updates of our review during the
COVID-19 situation and six months thereafter (living review), given the necessity for a short-term
action, the currently increasing evidence and the rising number of published guidelines and
recommendations in the context of COVID-19. An international expert task force including
representatives from each of the six WHO regions (Europe, America, Africa, Eastern-Mediterranean,
South-East Asia, Western Pacific) defined research questions, keywords, Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) terms and a search strategy for the rapid systematic review. We searched the MEDical
Literature Analysis and Retrieval System OnLINE (MEDLINE) [PubMed], the Cumulative Index to
Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) [Ebsco] and the Turning Research Into Practice (Trip)
database on April 27th, 2020 (calendar week 17) for medical guidelines and recommendations in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic published after February 1st, 2020. An initial limited search was
conducted to verify our selection of search terms and proposed strategy. The results of the initial pilot
search were discussed with the task force. The search strategy (Supplement Table A) was adapted
accordingly and approved before conducting the literature search in MEDLINE, CINAHL and Trip. To
identify grey literature (7), the task force members were asked to indicate any additional guidelines
and recommendations not identified in the database queries. In addition, we examined the websites
of cross-regional associations and institutions at continent level. The study protocol is publicly available
at www.researchgate.net (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.21293.51689). All task force members completed a
conflict of interest form.

Study selection
Inclusion criteria were (i) guidelines and recommendations related to the COVID-19 situation, (ii) all
types of healthcare workers providing any kind of healthcare to any patient population, (iii) any setting
(acute care, rehabilitation, long-term care, practice, home visits, etc.). We excluded documents that
only discuss (i) infection control and exposure safety information, (ii) experimental pharmaceutical
treatments, (iii) clinical research recommendations, (iv) ethical guidelines, (v) results not produced in

direct relation to the COVID-19 situation, (vi) textbooks, theoretical exercises, case studies, experience
write-ups, and (vii) documents not available in English.
Results from the searches in MEDLINE and CINAHL were downloaded in Covidence
(www.covidence.org) and duplicates removed thereafter. One reviewer (MA) screened titles and
abstracts for basic inclusion and exclusion criteria as described above. To ensure accuracy of the
selection process, 60 percent of the titles and abstracts were independently screened by other
reviewers (EMos, VR, TS). Disagreements were resolved through consensus. Reasons for exclusion are
provided in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart
(8) in Figure 1 and in more detail in the supplementary material (Supplement Table B). Following a
training session, full text screening was carried out by at least two reviewers per document (MA, LL,
EMos, JM, MO, VR, TS). For the planned updates (living review), we will use automated text mining
(tm) based on the tm package in R (www.r-project.org) to support abstract screening and study
selection.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Data extracted included study characteristics (Supplement Table C), a critical appraisal according to
The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation Instrument (AGREE II) (4) and classification of
the guidelines according to the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) Guidance
Manual and Rules for Guideline Development (9). The AGREE II is the gold-standard protocol for clinical
guideline assessment, development, and reporting (4). It comprises 23 items assessing six domains
including scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation,
applicability, and editorial independence. The AWMF Guidance Manual and Rules for Guideline
Development classifies guidelines as being based either on (i) a systematic literature review including
a subsequent synthesis of the evidence and a structured consensus process completed by a
representative committee (S3), (ii) a systematic literature review and synthesis of the evidence only
(S2e), (iii) a structured consensus process completed by a representative committee only (S2k) or (iv)
an informal consensus process by a group of experts (S1)(9).

Reviewers pilot-tested the data extraction form on 19 (10%) of the records (Supplement Table C) then
independently extracted the data. AGREE II scores were ranked on a Likert scale from 1=strongly
disagree to 7=strongly agree. Mean scores between the two reviewers were calculated for each AGREE
II item. AGREE II items were summarized into the six domain scores (4). An overall rating and a
qualitative recommendation were assigned and disagreements were resolved through consensus.
AGREE domain-level scores were calculated for each publication and mean domain-level scores were
formed for the entire dataset and the S3 guidelines separately.
Data Synthesis and Analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for relevant extraction fields for the entire dataset using
Microsoft Excel, including geographic affiliation of authors, publication status, type of
recommendation, target population, focus of recommendation, disease/condition, and setting. Other
fields are presented narratively, where appropriate. The world map was created in the Free and Open
Source Geographic Information System QGIS (https://qgis.org/en/site/). We used the PRISMA checklist
for standardized reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as a reference for the reporting of
our results (Supplement Table F).

Results
In total, we identified 819 records in MEDLINE, 89 in CINAHL and 434 in Trip through our systematic
search, and four additional records through other sources (Figure 1). We retained 397 documents for
abstract and full text screening. Of these, 188 guidelines and recommendations met the inclusion
criteria and were selected for data extraction and critical appraisal.
Target areas, professionals and country representation of authors
The most frequent medical areas addressed in the guidelines were acute COVID-19 care (n=46; 24%),
surgery (n=41; 22%), oncology (n=20; 11%), radiology (n=14; 7%) and cardiology (n=10; 5%). A third
(n=57; 30%) of the guidelines focused on miscellaneous other medical areas (Supplement Table D). All
except four guidelines (184; 98%) targeted physicians. The four guidelines not targeting physicians

referred to care delivered by non-physician health professionals, namely pharmacy practice
management for hematopoietic cell transplantation and cellular therapy (10), physiotherapy
management for COVID-19 in the acute hospital settings (11) and two articles on pharmaceutical care
(12, 13). Overall, 84 guidelines (45%) mentioned the work of non-physician health professionals. This
includes naming specific professions and/or grouping all non-physician health professionals under
members of a healthcare team. Thirty-two (17%) guidelines also targeted patients and/or the general
public. Patients were included as reviewers in the development of only one guideline (14). Experts
from 54 countries participated in the guidelines development, with Africa being the least represented
continent and North America being the most represented continent (Figure 2). A process for regular
updates was described in 27 guidelines (14%).
Critical methodological appraisal
The highest average AGREE II (4) domain score was given for scope and purpose (89%), followed by
clarity of presentation (70%) and editorial independence (61%). Stakeholder involvement was on
average fulfilled by 43% and applicability by 35%. The lowest average AGREE domain score (25%) was
given for rigor of development due to the fact that methods of development were insufficiently or not
reported. The domain scores of each guideline are shown in Supplement Table E. The mean overall
quality rating of the guidelines was 3.8 (standard deviation +/-1.4) of a maximum score 7.
Eight of all 188 guidelines (4%) (11, 14-20) were classified as having the highest methodological level
(systematic literature search and structured consensus process by representative experts; S3) (9).
Twelve guidelines (6%) were solely based on a systematic literature review and synthesis of the
evidence (S2e), while a further 12 (6%) were developed using a structured consensus process
completed by a representative committee only (S2k). The majority of the guidelines and
recommendations, namely 156 (83%), were developed based on an informal consensus process by a
group of experts (S1). Papers which referred to a consensus process or expert opinion without
providing any details were also assigned to the group of S1 guidelines. An overview about the number
of published guidelines regarding their S-classification is depicted separately for each week in Figure

3. The eight S3 guidelines had an average overall quality rating of 6.7 (standard deviation +/-0.5) of a
maximum score 7 and are depicted Table 1.
Discussion
A considerable number of medical guidelines and recommendations related to the COVID-19 pandemic
were published from February to April 2020. Despite high AGREE II scores for scope and purpose as
well as for clarity of presentation, the majority of the guidelines and recommendations fell short of
basic standards. This was mainly due to a lack of appropriate methodologies and rigorous strategies in
the guideline development process. The quality and methodological limitations of the guidelines
should be placed in the context of the current unprecedented situation and the human resources
required to produce high-quality guidelines in a timely manner. While systematically developed
statements reflecting the current state of knowledge and supporting health professionals in their work
during the COVID-19 pandemic have been urgently needed, basic methodological standards in the
guideline development process are nevertheless essential to avoid misleading information and
potentially harmful actions for patients and the healthcare system as a whole. One S3 guideline (19)
with high overall methodological ratings had been published in calendar week six from when we found
the first guidelines in our search (Figure 3), demonstrating that it was possible to produce high-quality
work in a short time. Taking more time to develop guidelines therefore may not always lead to a more
rigorous methodological basis. Rather, the methodological commitment, expertise of the authors and
engagement of appropriate stakeholders might be important for a rigorous development process,
independent of the time period after the outbreak when the guideline was published. Future guideline
developers should thus be encouraged to consider rigorous methodological standards; further
research could monitor the evolving methodological quality of the guidelines and their updates over
time. Similar to our findings of clinical practice guidelines falling short of basic methodological
standards, a recent review of prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 concluded
that the published models were also poorly reported and at high risk of bias (21).

Clinical practice guidelines with the highest methodological quality, classified as S3 according to
AWMF, are built on both a systemic literature review and a structured consensus process by
representative experts. Only 4% of all guidelines in our study were S3. Another 6% reported solely a
structured consensus process without a systematic literature review (classified as S2k according to
AWMF). The majority (83%) was based on an informal consensus by a group of experts only. However,
even if some guidelines developers might argue that well-designed studies were lacking at a certain
time point and a systemic literature review as a basis for the guideline development was therefore not
conducted, a structured consensus process could still have been done.
A clear updating process, patient and public involvement, a systematic development processes
incorporating systematic review, an explicit recommendation development process (rigor of
development domain), and guidance on implementation of these guidelines (applicability domain) are
needed areas to improve guideline development quality. Given the increasing evidence related to the
COVID-19 pandemic, a clear updating process, as well as information of where previous and later
versions of the guideline can be found might be essential information which should be explicitly stated
in each document. Although patient and public involvement is recognized as a key component of
clinical practice guideline development (22), almost no citizens, patients or their public representatives
were involved in the development of any of the documents, except for one guideline (14).
Non-physician health professionals provide essential care, especially in the area of nonpharmacological interventions including physical activity/exercise, activity pacing, pain management,
complex chronic disease management, nutrition, speech/aural care, personal care, disability,
rehabilitation, substance use, aged care and psychosocial health (23). Some of these interventions
have been continuously provided during the current COVID-19 situation, some health services have
not been delivered due to home quarantine and physical distancing.(24) Guidelines and
recommendations on how to manage and respond to this situation are often missing. Currently, the
majority of the published guidelines, which we reviewed, did not focus on the specific needs of nonphysician health professionals who are usually in direct/face-to-face patient contact. However, due to

often unclear information about the background and role of each author in the guideline development
process, transparency on stakeholder involvement was sometimes lacking and judgement was left to
the discretion of the reviewers. Balanced stakeholder involvement as well as explicit information about
this process in the paper would be necessary for a transparent guideline development that takes into
account different treatment perspectives.
Our study focused on quality criteria of the published guidelines and recommendations. We did not
extract, compare and synthesize the medical content of the recommendations, due to the
heterogeneity of medical disciplines included in this work. This might be regarded as a limitation of our
work. Nevertheless, our results might also contribute to a further conversation on how best to mobilize
national and international resources to develop high-quality guidelines in crisis situations in the future.

Conclusion
A considerable number of medical guidelines and recommendations were published in the context of
the COVID-19 pandemic from February to April 2020. Despite high AGREE II scores for scope and
purpose as well as for clarity of presentation, the majority of the guidelines and recommendations fell
short of basic methodological standards. This was mainly due to a lack of appropriate methodologies
and rigorous strategies in the guideline development process. Updated guidelines should include upto-date information, transparent stakeholder involvement, consideration of various patient
populations, and rigorous strategies and methodologies.
