Abstract
Background
The efficacy of national lockdowns to control COVID-19 epidemics has been demonstrated. This study
aimed at assessing the impact of national and regional lockdowns, in the context of quickly growing
pandemic waves, considering the French first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic as a case study.
Methods
We developed a compartmental epidemic model considering the demographic and age profile of the
population of the 13 regions of metropolitan France. We assessed the impact on morbidity, mortality,
and hospital resources of simulated national and regional lockdowns starting at different time.
Results
In a regional lockdown scenario aimed at preventing intensive care units (ICU) saturation in continental
France in March 2020, almost all regions would have had to implement a lockdown within 10 days
from the actual date of the nationwide implementation. By this date, 97% of ICU capacities would have
been used and almost 7000 more lives would have been lost, compared to the March 17 lockdown
which limited the mortality burden in hospital to 18 130 deaths. For slowly growing epidemics, with a
lower reproduction number, the expected delays between regional lockdowns increases. However,
the public health costs associated with these delays tend to grow exponentially with time.
Conclusions
In a quickly growing pandemic wave, defining the timing of lockdowns at a regional rather than national
level delays by a few days the implementation of a nationwide lockdown but leads to substantially
higher morbi-mortality and stress on the healthcare system.

Key messages


In a quickly growing pandemic wave, defining the timing of lockdowns at a regional level delays
the implementation of a nationwide lockdown by a few days, but leads to substantially higher
morbi-mortality and stress on the healthcare system.



The impact of a delayed regional lockdown greatly depends on the reproduction number in
the region, with morbi-mortality costs growing exponentially with the delay.



If delayed regional lockdowns are necessary to ensure population acceptability, slowing down
the epidemic ahead of the measure may decrease the morbi-mortality associated with this
delay.

Introduction
After it was first identified in December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread over the world,
challenging health systems. To contain this pandemic, countries implemented control strategies of
different intensities for example travel restrictions, closing of schools, shops, stay-at-home orders and
lockdowns, at national or regional levels.1–3 Combinations of these interventions led to important
reductions of the effective reproduction number of the epidemic in a number of countries before the
Summer 2020.1,2,4,5 France was one of the European countries most affected by the first pandemic
wave, along with Italy, Spain and the UK. The first cases of COVID-19 due to importations were
confirmed on January 24, 2020.6 They were followed by several clusters mostly located in the eastern
regions of France (Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté) and Ile-de-France (the most populated
French region including the city of Paris). The seeding of the epidemic in these regions mean that they
were ahead of other regions in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients admitted into intensive care
units (ICU) (mean of 53 and 31 daily ICU admissions from March 11 to March 17 in Ile-de-France and
Grand-Est, respectively, compared to 1 to 12 in other French regions).5,7 To avoid saturation of the
healthcare system, the French government ordered a national lockdown starting on March 17, 2020.

The efficacy of lockdown strategies to control COVID-19 epidemics has been internationally
demonstrated at the national

1,2,5,8,9

and county levels.10 However, some have argued that the

nationwide application in France of such measures was unnecessary and that lockdowns restricted to
the two or three most impacted French regions would have been sufficient to contain the pandemic
wave. The present study aimed at retrospectively comparing the impact of the nationwide lockdown
on March 17 to regional lockdowns on the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, occupied ICU beds,
life-years gained, and deaths avoided during the first pandemic wave in France.

Methods
Mathematical model
We used a deterministic, age-structured, compartmental epidemic model based on demographic and
age profile of the population of the 13 administrative regions of metropolitan France. Model
description, equations, and parameter values are presented in supplementary materials. The
transmission model was implemented in C++. Data collection, data management, simulations, results
analysis and reporting were performed using R.11

Analysis of national and regional lockdowns
For each region, we estimated the reproduction number before the lockdown (Rprelockdown), and after
its implementation (Rlockdown). Then, in order to simulate a regional lockdown, we used the Rprelockdown
up to the starting date of the measure; and the Rlockdown estimated in the region after that date. We
assumed that the transmission rate remained constant until July 1. We also assumed that the epidemic
dynamic was driven by local behaviour within regions and that interactions between regions had no
impact on local reproduction numbers.
We simulated national lockdowns starting on all dates from March 10 to March 31, thus exploring
other dates of start beyond the actual date of March 17. We then simulated asynchronous regional
lockdowns, in which each region could be locked down independently of other regions, on different
dates. We considered the following epidemic thresholds as starting dates of regional lockdowns: either
(1) the date on which the estimated incidence of hospital admissions in the region reached the level
of the most affected region during the first wave (i.e. Grand-Est, here called GES threshold), or (2) the
last date on which a lockdown would allow the region to stay below its ICU capacity limit (here called
ICU capacity threshold).

For each simulation, we computed at the national and regional levels the cumulative numbers of
hospital and ICU admissions, maximum occupied ICU beds, deaths, life years and quality-adjusted life
years (QALY) lost between March 1 and July 1 and computed the relative change compared to the
outcomes obtained when the real lockdown date was used.

Scenario with a slower epidemic growth
To better understand how the reproduction number affect the estimated impact of the lockdown, we
analysed scenarios where Rprelockdown is in the range 1.1 to 1.5. This corresponds to the reproduction
numbers observed in France at the start of 2021. In this analysis, we kept the previously estimated
Rlockdown for each region during the lockdown.

Results
Pre-lockdown and lockdown epidemiological dynamics
Table 1 presents estimates of the reproduction number before Rprelockdown and during the lockdown
period Rlockdown by region (see Supplementary Figures S1 to S4 for the fitting of hospital admissions, ICU
admissions, occupied ICU beds and deaths). The median regional reproduction number before the
national lockdown was 2.66 with a minimum of 1.96 (95% confidence interval [1.79-2.13]) in Hautsde-France and a maximum of 4.17 [3.44-5.03] in Centre-Val de Loire (Table 1). After the
implementation of the lockdown, the median reproduction number was estimated at 0.70.
The lockdown was implemented on March 17, 2020 at a time when there were 6.09 daily hospital
admissions per 100 000 inhabitants in the Grand-Est region (reference region). Using the pre-lockdown
reproduction number, we found that the date when this threshold would have been reached without
lockdown ranged from March 18 for Ile-de-France to April 7 for Bretagne (Table 1, GES threshold).
Using the same process, we found that all regions but Bretagne would have implemented a lockdown
by March 27, 2020 in order to avoid ICU saturation (Table 1, ICU capacity threshold).

Impact of a national lockdown
At the national level, setting a national lockdown one day later than the observed lockdown, i.e on
March 18, would have led to an increase of 1445 ICU admissions, the need for 820 additional ICU beds,
and 1839 deaths (i.e. 2 ICU admissions and 3 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants); corresponding to a loss
of almost 16 600 QALY (Figure 1 – regional results are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2
and Supplementary Figure S5). It would have led to an increase in the maximum number of occupied
ICU beds at the peak between 8% and 21% at the regional level (Figure 2); in hospital admissions
between 7% and 18%; in ICU admissions between 7% and 18%; and in deaths between 7% and 19%
(Supplementary Figures S6 to S8). A national lockdown one week after the official start, i.e. on March
24, would have led to 12 963 additional ICU admissions and 16 536 additional deaths (i.e. 20 ICU
admissions and 26 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants); corresponding to 148 000 QALY lost. Moreover,
14 982 ICU beds would have been needed to accommodate all ICU admissions and would have led to
an overrun of ICU capacity with 138% occupancy of ICU beds (Figure 1 and 2).

Starting the lockdown one day earlier, i.e. on March 16 instead of March 17, would have led to 1327
fewer ICU admissions and 1689 fewer deaths, corresponding to around 15 200 QALY saved. In addition,
6495 ICU beds would have been needed at peak, corresponding to 740 fewer ICU beds than what was
observed. Locally, it would have led to a reduction in the range 7%-16% for the number of deaths and
7-16% for the number of ICU admissions (Supplementary Figures S7 and S8). If the global lockdown
had started 7 days earlier on March 10, it would have led to 7218 fewer ICU admissions, 9194 fewer
deaths and around 83 000 QALY saved. Moreover, 3881 fewer ICU beds would have been needed at
peak, corresponding to approximately half the number of ICU beds used at the peak of the wave.

Impact of regional lockdowns
The first scenario, where the start of the lockdown is delayed in each region according to the GES
threshold (the date on which the estimated incidence of hospital admissions reached 6.09 per 100 000

inhabitants in the region), would have led to 16 906 additional ICU admissions, 19 066 additional
deaths and the need for 15 434 ICU beds at the national level. Approximately 239 000 life-years and
172 200 QALY would have been lost with this delay. It would have resulted in a peak of daily hospital
admissions ranging from 406 in Bretagne to 1736 in Ile-de-France (Supplementary Figure S9). This
scenario would have led to the saturation of ICU capacities in some regions (Figure 2).
In the scenario where each region implements a lockdown no later than the moment allowing them to
remain within its ICU capacity (ICU capacity threshold), three regions (Grand-Est, Ile-de-France and
Bourgogne-Franche-Comté) would have had to be locked down from the start of the study period, on
March 17, and one region (Bretagne) could have been locked down three weeks later on April 2, 2020.
However, all regions but Bretagne would have had to implement a lockdown by March 27, 2020. By
this date, a maximum of 96.8% of national ICU capacities would have been used, instead of less than
70% with the observed national lockdown 10 days earlier, and almost 7000 more lives would have
been lost (Figure 3).

Scenario with a slower epidemic growth
The sensitivity analysis showed that the lockdown impact depends not only on timing but also on the
pre-lockdown reproduction number Rprelockdown observed in the region (Supplementary Figure S10).
For example, delaying the national lockdown two weeks later on March 31 would have led to 1218
additional deaths with Rprelockdown=1.1 but 5439 additional deaths with Rprelockdown=1.5. In addition, for
any given reproduction number, the cost of delaying the lockdown increases exponentially with time,
for all outcomes. As an example, a synchronized lockdown on March 10 with a reproduction number
equal to 1.5 would have led to 1896 fewer deaths, whereas on March 24 it would have led to 2421
additional deaths.

This study aimed at comparing the impact of lockdown strategies where the timing of the lockdown is
defined at the national vs at the regional scale, in the context of a quickly growing pandemic wave.
This was done thanks to a compartmental model that reproduced the epidemic dynamics of the Spring
2020 pandemic wave in France and simulated several counterfactual scenarios to that of the
nationwide lockdown implemented on March 17.
Using our model, we estimated that, at the time of the first national lockdown, all regions were not at
the same epidemic stage. Indeed, the threshold of 6.09 hospital admissions per 100,000 inhabitants
estimated in the most affected region at the time lockdown took place (Grand-Est region), would have
been reached in other regions within 1 day (Ile-de-France) - 21 days (Bretagne) after March 17, in the
absence of lockdown. As expected, delaying the lockdown would have led to additional hospital and
ICU admissions, and deaths, independently of the region. Waiting to reach this threshold in each region
would have resulted in an increase of 16 906 ICU admissions and 19 066 deaths at the national level,
comparable to the total number of ICU admissions and deaths registered in the country until July 1.7
This delay would have resulted in a 7-fold increase of deaths in some regions (Nouvelle-Aquitaine)
compared to the observed outcome. Moreover, these numbers do not take into account the additional
deaths due to healthcare system congestion. Therefore, it is likely that the lockdown would have been
implemented before the saturation of all regions. On the other hand, starting the national lockdown
one week earlier would have resulted into up to 9194 fewer deaths, corresponding to around 83 000
QALY lost at the national level. The reduction was higher in regions where the reproduction number
was high, highlighting the importance of this parameter in the decision to start a lockdown.
We also analysed the impact of regional lockdowns. Using a threshold based on the number of hospital
admissions to trigger a regional lockdown failed to prevent regions from exceeding their ICU capacity.
This is easily explained by different ICU capacities per inhabitant by region, and because the impact of
lockdown timing depends not only on the incidence but also on the epidemic dynamics, described by
the reproduction number R. Depending on R, the same level of incidence in two regions on a given day
can lead to very different dynamics in the following days, as shown in the scenario with a slower

epidemic growth. The higher the reproduction number, the higher the cost of delaying the lockdown.
Our simulations showed that regional lockdowns, where each lockdown is started on the last date that
allows the region to stay within its ICU capacity, would have led to 7000 additional deaths compared
to the observed lockdown. In this scenario, all regions but one would have been locked down within
10 days. Although each region would have stayed within its ICU capacities, 97% of national ICU
capacities would have been used at peak. These assessments are performed retrospectively. In realtime, it would be difficult to precisely estimate the date when the lockdown should be implemented
to avoid the saturation of local ICUs. As a consequence, there is a real risk that the regional approach
would have led to the saturation of ICUs in some locations.
Considering the latest information on SARS-CoV-2 and its characteristics, our estimated values of
reproduction number were similar to the ones obtained by other researchers before and after the
lockdown.4,12,13 Regarding the computation of outcomes of interest (hospital requirements and
deaths), we considered the whole care pathway of patients inside hospital settings (Figure S13). In
addition, all these estimations were based on observed parameters (lengths of stay, ICU admission
risk, and death risk) in real settings and modulated for each region with specific estimated coefficients
to account for regional disparities. However, some differences may remain, mainly due to change in
hospitalization strategies during the crisis. Concerning the quantification of the impact of a delayed
lockdown, we chose Grand-Est as the reference region, as it was the first impacted region of the first
wave of the epidemic in France, and thus the number of hospitalizations in this region at lockdown
start was a good threshold for comparisons.5
The mortality estimates presented in this study do not consider deaths occurring outside hospitals (at
home – estimated to be around 5% of all COVID-related deaths14 – or in nursing homes –10 497 deaths
recorded as of July 2, 2020)15 as we limited our analysis to hospital settings. Moreover, our model also
does not account for the excess mortality that would have resulted from hospital saturation. Given the
important excess hospital and ICU admissions that would have occurred with a delayed lockdown, it is
likely that the saturation of the health care system would have resulted in an important excess

mortality. This was avoided in France thanks to the transfer of 658 patients from highly affected to less
affected regions, which remained less infected thanks to the national lockdown (personal
communication). Therefore, our analysis may underestimate the number of deaths, life years and QALY
lost in scenarios where delays in the implementation of the lockdown increase substantially the stress
on the healthcare system. In addition, QALY lost were only estimated based on the deaths of infected
individuals, whereas it would be interesting to take into account the lost QALY due to severe COVID19 leading to hospitalization and ICU admissions, since there may still be after-effects for these
individuals.16 However, to our knowledge, no study has been done in France to provide utility measures
in these cases. Regarding the estimation of ICU occupancy, the maximum ICU capacity in each region
corresponded to the maximum number of beds that could be mobilised during the pandemic, which
was higher than the normal number of ICU beds at the national level. Without this mobilisation of new
ICU beds, ICU saturation would have been reached much earlier. Finally, our study relied on the
hypothesis that implementing regionals lockdowns is doable and acceptable by the population. Some
European countries such as Italy,3,17 Germany3 or United Kingdom18 have implemented such measures.
In France, spatially targeted measures were introduced only after the first wave and for less restrictive
measures than a full lockdown.19 On one hand it allows to limit the implementation of strong control
measures in areas where the infection risk is high, and potentially acknowledged by the population.
On the other hand, it raises questions regarding the consequences related to population movements
that may occur following or preceding the lockdown of a region.10 In addition, some studies have
shown that localized mitigation measures, less strict than national lockdown (curfew in specific
metropolitan area, closing of shops or schools), have led to a reduction in the French population
mobility20 and a slowdown of the epidemic in non-restricted areas.19
This study highlights that the impact of a delayed regional lockdown greatly depends on the
reproduction number in the region, with costs in terms of morbi-mortality growing exponentially with
the delay. It also shows that in a quickly growing pandemic wave such as the one observed in Spring
2020 in France, defining the timing of lockdowns at a regional rather than national level delays by only

Transmission model
We used a deterministic, age-structured, compartmental epidemic model based on demographic and
age profile of the population administrative regions of metropolitan France (Supplementary Figure
S11). We considered that individuals were susceptible (S), and then potentially exposed to the virus
but not infectious (E). As observed in clinical practice, we set children and adolescents to be less
susceptible to infection than other age groups.21 Exposed individuals stay in their compartment for an
average of 2.72 days22 before moving to either asymptomatic (A) or pre-symptomatic (Ips)
compartment according to observed risk of being asymptomatic.21 We considered that asymptomatic
individuals were 45% less infectious than pre-symptomatic individuals were23 and we assumed they
stayed in the compartment for an average of 10.91 days before moving to the removed compartment
(R) of patients that are cured or dead from COVID-19. Pre-symptomatic individuals will become
infected symptomatic (Is) after an average duration of 2.38 days. This choice of parameters gave a
mean incubation period of 5.1 days,1 within around 2 days of pre-symptomatic transmissions. Then
they become after an average of 5 days (assumption) either hospitalized (Ih) or remain within the
community (Inh) according to age-dependent hospitalization risks.4 We assumed that hospitalized
individuals were no more infectious because of their hospitalization whereas non-hospitalized keeps
spreading the disease with the same intensity as symptomatic individuals. We assumed the average
duration in Inh compartment was 3.53 days to match the total duration in the asymptomatic
compartment. Finally, both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals moved to the removed
compartment.

To match the epidemic dynamics and reproduce the Erlang distributions of durations in each
compartment of the transmission model, we subdivided each compartments having a role in the

infection process into sub-compartments. This subdivision had no impact on the mean duration spent
in each compartment. A sensitivity analysis testing several combinations revealed that 10 subcompartments in each compartment permitted to approach the observed dynamics of the epidemic
(Supplementary Figure S12).

Model parametrization
The population was divided into 17 age groups: 16 age-band of 5 years from 0 to 80 years, and a last
group for people aged 80 years and older. The population structure of each region was inferred from
hospital catchment areas from 2016 and 2017 census data provided by the French National Institute
of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee).24,25 To simulate age and location-dependent mixing, we used
inter-individual contacts matrices for the French population estimated by Prem et al.26
We retrieved epidemiological regional data related to the COVID-19 epidemic in metropolitan France
gathered by the French National Public Health Agency (SpF-'Santé publique France')7 daily number of
hospital admissions (general and intensive care unit (ICU) wards), daily number of ICU admissions, daily
number of occupied ICU beds, and daily number of deaths in hospitals (deaths in nursing homes and
at home were not considered). All these epidemiological data were corrected for reporting delays
following the same procedure as Salje et al.4 We also obtained data on the maximum ICU beds capacity
per French region from the ‘Direction de la Recherche, des Études, de l'Évaluation et des Statistiques’
(Drees) regarding the situation during the March 2020 lockdown (personal communication)
(Supplementary Table S3).

Estimation of hospital-related outcomes
Based on the estimated number of new infected hospitalized cases per day provided by our
epidemiological model, we inferred outcomes related to hospital requirements, namely ICU
admissions, ICU occupied beds, and deaths.

We divided the hospital settings in two parts: general ward and ICU ward (Supplementary Figure S13).
The epidemiological transmission model estimated the daily number of new hospitalized cases due to
COVID-19 infection, regardless of the ward (i.e. ICU and general wards). Once admitted to hospital,
infected cases could either remain in the general ward until the end of their stay or go into ICU, if they
became severe cases. We assumed that cases admitted in ICU entered ICU ward the same day as they
were admitted in hospital (pre-ICU length of stay equal to 0 day). Once in ICU, cases could either die
or stay in ICU until their discharge to general ward. Cases in general ward could either die or stay in
general ward until their discharge to home.
We used age-dependent ICU admission risks for hospitalized patients estimated by Salje et al.4 We also
used age-specific lengths of stay in ICU to estimate the number of occupied ICU beds.27 We estimated
the number of deaths using hospital and ICU death risks estimated by the Drees on all the hospitalized
cases of the first wave of epidemic in France (March-June 2020).27 Deaths were delayed in time using
the time from hospital or ICU admission to death.27 Lengths of stay in general ward before discharge,
lengths of stay in general ward before death and post-ICU lengths of stay in general ward were not
used as we did not estimated the total number of hospital beds needed. This had no impact on the
results provided by the model.
We also estimated the number of life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) lost for each death
using life tables provided by INSEE for 2012-201628 and utility measures of each age-group in France.29

Statistical framework
We estimated region-specific model parameters by maximum likelihood in a two-step process using
the bbmle R package.30 First, on the period stretching from March 14 to May 10, 2020, corresponding
to the evolution of the epidemic until the end of the national lockdown, we estimated the value of the
transmission parameter β, governing the value of R0, the initial state in each compartment per age
group on March 1, 2020 and the effects of the national lockdown. The latter was estimated through a
transmission reduction parameter, hereafter called 𝑐𝛽 , and multiplied the transmission parameter

(and thus contact matrices) to reproduce the several mitigation measures implemented and their
consequences on the regional propagation. We jointly estimated these parameters by fitting the daily
de-seasonalized time series of hospital admissions (hereafter denoted Hosp) using the likelihood 𝐿𝛽
defined in Equation 1.
𝐿𝛽 = ∏ 𝑁𝐵𝑖𝑛 (𝐻𝑜𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 (𝑡)|𝐻𝑜𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 (𝑡))

(Eq. 1)

𝑡

where NBin(.|X) is a negative binomial distribution of mean X and overdispersion 𝑋 𝛿 , 𝛿 being a
parameter specific to each region to be estimated. Confidence intervals of these two parameters were
estimated using likelihood profiling methods.30

In a second step, we jointly estimated three regional coefficients adjusting age-specific risks of ICU
admissions, risk of deaths and lengths of stay in ICU (including ICU stays leading to death). They were
estimated by simultaneously fitting the time series of ICU admissions (hereafter denoted ICU), deaths
(both smoothed using 7-day centered moving average) and occupied ICU beds (hereafter denoted
BedICU) from March 14 to May 10, 2020 using the likelihood 𝐿𝐼𝐶𝑈−𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠 defined in Equation 2.

𝐿𝐼𝐶𝑈−𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠 = ∏

𝑁𝐵𝑖𝑛 (𝐼𝐶𝑈𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 (𝑡)|𝐼𝐶𝑈𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 (𝑡)) . 𝑁𝐵𝑖𝑛 (𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 (𝑡)|𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 (𝑡)) .
