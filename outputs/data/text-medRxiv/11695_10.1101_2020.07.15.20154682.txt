Abstract

31

Introduction

32

As students return to colleges and universities in the fall of 2020, it is important to understand

33

their perception of risk and their desire for in person versus online learning, which may differ

34

between undergraduate and graduate students.

35

Methods

36

We anonymously surveyed 212 undergraduate and 134 graduate students in the College of

37

Public Health, and 94 graduate students in the College of Education in late June, 2020. We

38

asked them Likert style questions regarding their comfort returning to campus and their

39

preferred learning strategies once back. We compared “Strongly agree/Agree” with

40

“Neutral/Disagree/Strongly disagree” using a chi-square test.

41

Results

42

Graduate students were significantly less likely to look forward to being on campus (38.3%

43

doctoral vs 40.6% master's vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), more likely to perceive

44

themselves as high risk (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs 17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001),

45

and were more likely to prefer all classwork online (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% master’s vs 20.8%

46

undergraduate, p < 0.001). Graduate students were also less likely to prefer to be in the

47

classroom as much as possible in the fall (59.2% doctoral vs 67.7% master’s vs 74.5%

48

undergraduate, p < 0.001). Most were not concerned about their ability to conduct research.

49

Students generally supported wearing of facemasks indoors.

50

Conclusions

51

There are important differences in perception of risk and desire for online versus in-person

52

learning between undergraduate and graduate students. Faculty and administrators must

53

acknowledge and address these differences as they prepare for return to campus in the fall.

Introduction

56

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a worldwide health

57

crisis. There have been over 10 million confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide,1

58

with an estimated 10 undetected cases per confirmed case.2 As students return to campus in

59

the fall, it is important to understand their concerns and willingness to engage in usual

60

classroom activities. We hypothesize that undergraduate and graduate students may have

61

different attitudes towards returning to campus based on differences in age, attitudes toward

62

risk-taking behavior, likelihood of comorbid illness, and different living circumstances.3,4

63

Therefore, we anonymously surveyed students at the University of Georgia in the College of

64

Public Health and the College of Education with regards to their attitudes toward returning to

65

campus and their preferred learning environment.

66

67

Methods

68

The purpose of this survey was initially to provide guidance to faculty and administrators in the

69

College of Public Health at the University of Georgia regarding re-opening in the fall in the face

70

of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was shared with faculty in the College of Education who

71

had similar concerns. Once the survey results were examined, it was clear that they might be of

72

interest to the larger academic community and the decision was made to publish the results.

73

The survey was performed online in late June, 2020.

74

75

The questions used a Likert style format, with options of “Strongly disagree”, “Strongly agree”,

76

“Neutral”, “Agree”, and “Strongly agree”. After surveing students in the Department of

77

Epidemiology and Biostatistics, the survey was slightly adapted by leadership of the College of

78

Public Health (the question “I am comfortable with a requirement that students and faculty wear

79

masks in indoor spaces and during classes” was changed to “Strongly encouraging student to

80

wear face masks while indoors or during face-to-face lectures is a good idea”, and the question

81

“I prefer not to wear face masks while indoors or during face-to-face lectures” was added).

82

Students in the other departments of the College of Public Health were then invited to

83

participate, including graduate students and undergraduates. Finally, the survey was adapted

84

by faculty in the program of Learning Leadership and Organizational Development in the

85

College of Education and sent to their graduate students. They changed response categories

86

from 5 to 4, eliminating “Neutral”.

87

88

For analysis, categories were collapsed to “Strongly agree or agree” versus “Neutral, disagree,

89

or strongly disagree”. The chi-square test was used to evaluate statistical significance. Because

90

the surveys were originally done to guide policy and not as research, the Human Subjects

91

committee designated this as not human subjects research.

92

93

Results

94

The survey was completed by 346 graduate and undergraduate students in the College of

95

Public Health and 94 students in the College of Education. Among the College of Education

96

students, all in the Department of Lifelong Education Administration and Planning, 79 were

97

pursuing a doctoral degree and 15 a Master’s degree. Of the College of Public health students,

98

70 were pursuing a doctoral degree, 64 a Master’s degree, and 212 were undergraduates in

99

Health Promotion and Behavior or Environmental Health Sciences.

100

101

102

Graduate students were significantly more cautious regarding the return to campus. They were

103

less likely to agree with the statement that they were looking forward to being on campus

104

(38.3% doctoral vs 40.6% master's vs 77.7% undergraduate, p < 0.001), and more likely to

105

perceive themselves as being high risk for serious illness (43.3% doctoral vs 40.0% masters vs

106

17.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001). They were also more likely to agree that they preferred to

107

have all lectures and classwork online in the fall (66.7% doctoral vs 44.6% master’s vs 20.8%

108

undergraduate, p < 0.001), and less likely to prefer to be in the classroom as much as possible

109

in the fall (59.2% doctoral vs 67.7% master’s vs 74.5% undergraduate, p < 0.001). Just over

110

one-third of public health students were concerned about their ability to conduct research and

111

this did not differ by student category. Students generally supported wearing of facemasks while

112

indoors.

113

114

Conversely, undergraduate students had the lowest percentages for agreeing they were

115

concerned about acquiring COVID-19 upon return, for agreeing they wanted all classwork online

116

this fall, and for agreeing they were apprehensive about coming back to campus. Responses of

117

graduate students in the College of Education were compared with graduate students in the

118

College of Public Health. Students in the College of Public Health were slightly less likely to

119

favor a requirement to wear masks (74% vs 88%, p = 0.03). Otherwise there were no significant

120

differences in responses to the other questions.

121

122

Discussion

123

As students, faculty, staff, and administrators contemplate the return to campus this fall in the

124

face of COVID-19, each group is assessing their comfort with in-person teaching and on

125

campus meetings. In our survey, we found that students should not be treated as a monolithic

126

group, and that graduate students were much more concerned about their risk of acquiring

127

infection and significantly more comfortable with the idea of online instruction than

128

undergraduates.

129

130

The disparity between undergraduate and graduate perspectives about on campus instruction

131

and activities suggests that typical “Return to Campus Guidelines" do not cater to graduate

132

student concerns. This survey is critical to understanding that diverse student groups have

133

differing perspectives of risk. Given these range of perspectives regarding health and safety,

134

universities should provide more latitude in how courses and meetings will be conducted in light

135

of concerns for safety.

136

137

In 2018 there were approximately 1.8 million graduate students in the United States, of whom

138

57% were enrolled full-time with the largest enrollments in education, business, and health

139

sciences.5 These fields also have the largest proportions of part-time graduate students who

140

likely manage employment and dependent care in addition to graduate school. Notably, 57% of

141

graduate students are women,6 who usually bear the burden of domestic tasks and dependent

142

care. Further, research on homeschooling during the pandemic shows it is being handled

143

disproportionately by women,7 and longitudinal data show working mothers shoulder the bulk of

144

childcare and housework without reductions in work hours of more than 2 hours per day as

145

compared to 40 minutes for men.8

146

147

The average age of graduate students in the United States is approximately 33 years old,4 a

148

figure that has remained static over the years, with 22% of all graduate students over the age of

149

40 years.9 Only 48% of graduate students are unmarried with no dependents,4 suggesting that

150

over half of graduate students tend to have more adult-like responsibilities than undergraduates

151

such as employment and dependent care, potentially putting graduate students at higher risk of

152

exposing family members and work colleagues to COVID-19 if they are attending courses on

153

campus.

154

155

Conclusions

156

It is important for university programs to take an evidence-based and flexible approach to the

157

return to campus, one that addresses the differing concerns of graduate and undergraduate

158

students. This is especially important in health and leadership professions where students are

learning how critical decisions affect the health and wellbeing of organizations and communities.

160

Administrators are advocating a “HyFlex” approach to instruction. We advocate that university

161

administrators should adopt a similarly flexible approach that emboldens faculty and students to

162

make decisions about pedagogy that reflect their personal risk factors, concerns, and goals.
