Abstract
Background: While the number of detected SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely available,
an understanding of the extent of undetected cases is urgently needed for an effective tackling of the pandemic. The aim of this work is to estimate the true number of SARS-CoV-2
(detected and undetected) infections in several European Countries. The question being
asked is: How many cases have actually occurred?
Methods: We propose an upper bound estimator under cumulative data distributions,
in an open population, based on a day-wise estimator that allows for heterogeneity. The
estimator is data-driven and can be easily computed from the distributions of daily cases
and deaths. Uncertainty surrounding the estimates is obtained using bootstrap methods.
Results: We focus on the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases at April
17th. Differences arise at the Country level, and we get estimates ranging from the 3.93
times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France. Accurate estimates are obtained, as bootstrapbased intervals are rather narrow.
Conclusions: Many parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed
population and/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people
cannot fall (i.e. a lower bound). Here, we provide a methodological contribution introducing an upper bound estimator and provide reliable estimates on the dark number, i.e. how
many undetected cases are going around for several European Countries, where the epidemic
spreads differently.
Keywords: Capture-recapture methods; COVID-19; Geometric distribution; Chao’s lower
bound.

Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic
within few weeks. The number of detected cases increased day-by-day, at an exponential rate at
the beginning, and now follows a logistic distribution [1, 2]. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 might have

been vastly under-reported in official statistics. It is widely acknowledged that the majority
of the cases are asymptomatic and, thus, not observed or recorded [3–5]. In other words, the
available data just tell us a part of the story: individuals may be already infected but are not
aware of it, maybe because of the absence of symptoms, or cases may be under symptomatic
suspicion but the disease has not been diagnosed yet (due to the delay in getting swab results).
The total number of cases is thus unknown, and general comments on the spread of the epidemic are thus partial as based on a (relatively small) fraction of the total cases. Some studies
have used simulation-based approaches to infer reasonable estimates of total number of cases,
but often these estimates are surrounded by poor uncertainty measures, leading to too wide
confidence intervals [6]. Here, we are proposing a simple and effective method to obtain reasonable point and interval estimates of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in several
European countries. In detail, we introduce a novel estimator based on a capture recapture (CR)
approach. The capture-recapture method should be considered the gold standard for counting
when it is impossible to identify each case and large undercounts will occur [7]. CR methods
were originally developed in the ecological setting with the aim of estimating the unknown size
of a (possibly elusive) population and then they started to be applied also to epidemiological
and health sectors (see [8, 9]). Many CR estimators have been proposed in the literature (see
e.g. [10–12]), and some of them can be used to identify lower bounds [13] of the population
size. In the analysis SARS-CoV-2 infections, official data are available at the aggregated level,
whereas individual data are not available to the general or the academic public. Hence, it is
not possible to get the exact distribution of the number of infected individuals observed exactly
one day, exactly two days and so on until m days. The population is open, subjected to deaths,
and this may further complicate the analysis [14]. A lower bound of the total number of infected cases is computed by [3] modifying the Chao estimator [15] to address issues related to
the data at hand. This is a relevant result as it provides reasonable information to the policy
makers about the undetected cases and the magnitude this phenomenon may have at least, so
that national health systems may be aware of the minimum number of cases that may demand

health care services. At this stage of the spread of the epidemic, governments are willing to
relax restrictive measures and several researches address issues related to the epidemic [16–18].
To calibrate the new interventions, an estimate of the lower bound of the number of infections
may not be enough, as SARS-CoV-2 has already shown to spread around the population very
quickly [19–21]. This contribution aims at providing an approximated upper bound for the total
number of SARS-CoV-2 cases, to better appreciate the dimension of the epidemic, under the
worse scenario. Such an estimate is obtained from a non parametric CR model, providing an
upper bound estimate of the total number of infections regardless of the true data generating
process.
This contribution is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic notation and
how we are going to work with the data at hand. A brief summary of the modified Chao lower
bound is also discussed. These notions are then used to compute the upper bound, details of
which are provided in Section 3, along with the computation of the uncertainty surrounding the
estimates. In Section 4 we show the empirical application of the proposal on data from several
European countries. A discussion showing other interesting insights concludes.

2.1

Methods
Preliminaries

Let us denote with N (t) the cumulative count of infections at day t where t = t0 , · · · , tm . Hence
∆N (t) = N (t) − N (t − 1) are the number of new infections at day t where t = t0 + 1, · · · , tm .
Also, let D(t) denote the cumulative count of deaths at day t where t = t0 , · · · , tm . t0 defines the
beginning of the observational period and tm defines the end. We assume the trivial assumption
tm > t0 , so that the observational window is not empty. Again, we denote with ∆D(t) =
D(t) − D(t − 1) the count of new deaths at day t where t = t0 + 1, · · · , tm .
The question arises how this can be linked to a capture-recapture approach. Let Xi denote
the number of identifications for each infected individual i typically provided by the days the

individual will surely remain infected. Let denote τx the probability of identifying an individual
x times where x = 0, . . . A lower bound estimator of the unobserved frequency f0 , say fˆ0 , can
be estimated by using the observed frequency of those identified exactly once, f1 , and of those
identified twice, f2 , [13, 15]:
fˆ0 = f12 /f2 .

(1)

It is thus crucial to relate f1 and f2 with the data at hand. In detail, at each day t, f1 (t)
represents the infected people identified just once, i.e. the new infections, whose number is
given by ∆N (t). Similarly, f2 (t) represents the infected people detected at time (t − 1) and still
infected at time t. This can be computed as ∆N (t − 1) − ∆D(t). Hence the estimate for the
number of hidden infections at day t is
fˆ0 (t) =

[∆N (t)]2
.
∆N (t − 1) − ∆D(t)

(2)

By applying the estimator (1) day-wise we get the modified Chao lower bound estimator (see
[3]):
fˆ0 =

tm
X
t=t0

[∆N (t)]2
.
∆N (t − 1) − ∆D(t)

(3)

In practice, however, the bias-corrected form of (3) suggested by [22] is used:
fˆ0 =

tm
X
t=t0

∆N (t)[∆N (t) − 1]
.
1 + ∆N (t − 1) − ∆D(t)
+1

(4)

We define the understanding that ∆N (t − 1) − ∆D(t) is set to 0 if it becomes negative, in other
words we use max{0, ∆N (t − 1) − ∆D(t)}. The final estimate of lower bound (LB) of the total
number of infection is then given as what has been observed at the end of the observational
window tm and the estimate of the hidden numbers:
NLB = N (tm ) + fˆ0

The Upper Bound estimator

The lower bound is helpful as an indication of the minimum number of people having had SARSCoV-2 and answers to a fundamental open question: “How many undetected cases are at least

going around?”. Nevertheless, this information may be treated as a starting point whenever
interventions and tools to dampen the spread of the epidemic are rolled out. The proposed
upper bound estimator extends the research on the undetected cases and helps policy makers to
evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic situation locally and at the current phase of its development.
An estimate of the worse possible scenario is provided.
Following a similar strategy as in Section 2.1, this is achieved by firstly estimating daily-specific
upper-bounds and then summing up all the estimates to get the final point-estimate of the
maximum number of undetected cases. This daily–wise based upper bound approach provides
an approximation of the data generation process.
Let us introduce the cumulative distribution function
πij = P r(Xi ≤ j) = P r(Xi = 0) + P r(0 < Xi ≤ j) = πi0 + (1 − πi0 )pij ,

(6)

where homogeneity in the probability of being infected at a certain date t is assumed, i.e.
πij = πj , with pij = pj being the cumulative zero-truncated probability distribution. Equation
(6) represents the probability that an individual is infected for at most j days, and it is function
of π0 and pj ; but π0 is not observed. The quantities pj (j = 1, 2, 3) in equation (6) at each time
t may be approximated as
p1 (t) = f1 (t)/n∗obs (t),
p2 (t) = (f1 (t) + f2 (t))/n∗obs (t),
p3 (t) = (f1 (t) + f2 (t) + f3 (t))/n∗obs (t)
where f1 (t) and f2 (t) have been introduced in the previous section and
f3 (t) = ∆N (t − 2) − ∆D(t − 1) − ∆D(t).
and n∗obs (t) is the number of current infected individuals observed at each time. We think that
it is reasonable, for each day t, to consider the number of individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2
for the day t, for day t and the day before, and, for day t and the two days before, as m = 3 is the
minimum number of consecutive days of new infections necessary for the upper bound estimator

to be computed. Furthermore, considering more than 3 days for an individual to be observed as
affected by SARS-CoV-2 would lead to the risk of not observing the number of people affected
by SARS-CoV-2 for exactly four, five and so on times because of the higher risk of overlapping
cases.
Since π0 is unknown, to compute the probabilities in (6), we substitute it with
π̂0 (t) =

fˆ0 (t)
f1 (t) + f2 (t) + fˆ0 (t)

.

where fˆ0 (t) is the lower bound probability of undetected cases derived from the Chao estimator
in its bias corrected form, computed at each time t (see Equation 2). This also explains why a
lot of detail was devoted to the lower bound estimator in the previous section as it is very much
needed here. In other words, based on the Chao lower bound estimator of the undetected cases,
we derive the complete count distribution and calculate the upper bound for the population size
on such a complete distribution. Now, it follows that Equation (6) takes the form
π̂j (t) = π̂0 (t) + (1 − π̂0 (t))pj (t)
when theoretical probabilities are replaced by their now available estimates. In order to provide
an upper bound estimator we use the main results of [23]:
−1


pj+1 − pj 
πj ≤ pj 1 − (1 − pj ) 

that makes clear why at least m = 3 days should be considered. The right-hand side π̂0U B
of the above inequality provides an upper bound estimate of the population size based on the
Horvitz–Thompson estimator:
π̂0U B
fˆ0U B (t) = n∗obs (t)

To get an estimate for the missed SARS-CoV-2 infections fˆ0 (t) at each time t we compute the
Horvitz–Thompson (HT) estimator at each time t and ultimately we sum it up over all times,
reaching thus the final upper bound for the missed SARS-CoV-2 cases n0 as follows

Hence, the approximated upper bound of the total number of infected people, N̂U B , in the time
window from t0 to tm is then given by
N̂U B = fˆ0U B + Ntm .

2.3

Uncertainty estimation

A fundamental issue in general CR analyses is the quantification of uncertainty surrounding
the estimates of the unknown population size. An estimation of the population size can be
correctly computed, but if the associated estimation of variance is poor, then coverage by the
95% confidence interval may falsely indicate poor estimation by the point estimator, i.e. the
point estimator may result in a poor coverage rate. Focusing on the proposed upper-bound
estimator, we attempt here to investigate bootstrap methods as a robust and general approach
to estimate variances and confidence intervals. Various bootstrap methods have been considered
to estimate uncertainty in CR analyses with respect to other estimators [24–27]. In the following,
we consider two different bootstrap approaches to approximate the uncertainty surrounding the
point estimate: the imputed and the reduced bootstrap approaches.
Under the imputed bootstrap approach, we draw 1000 bootstrapped samples of size NU B generated according to a multinomial model whose probabilities are given by
(

where NU B (t) = fˆ0U B (t) + f1 (t) + f2 (t) + f3 (t).
Differently, under the reduced bootstrap approach, each of the bootstrapped samples contains
n∗obs (t) = f1 (t) + f2 (t) + f3 (t) observations generated according to a multinomial model whose

symmetric confidence intervals [28]: the sampling distribution could be skewed, the coverage

of an upper bound for undetected cases for several European countries (see Table 1). The last
column in Table 1 shows the ratio of the total estimated cases to the observed cases. The ratio
of the total estimated cases (in the worse scenario) to the observed cases is interesting in itself.
A ratio of 4.5 would mean that for every observed patient there are 3.5 infected persons unseen.
The reason for this can be manifold as these unseen cases might be without symptoms or show
very mild signs of infection.
As expected, the undetected cases represent a relevant portion of the total number of cases.
This is in line with a few existing works and discussions on the topic, see e.g. [29–31]. The
number of total number of cases are at most approximately 4.5 times the observed cases. Of
course, differences arise at the Country level, and heterogeneous estimates ranging from the 3.93
times of Norway to the 7.94 times of France, see Table 1. These differences are due to different
heterogeneity structures in the cases and deaths time series at the country level. These results
are telling us that SARS-COV-2 outbreak was more prevalent than described by the official data,
though a significant number of individuals that are infected actually remain asymptomatic.
Point estimates can be used to synthetically describe the SARS-COV-2 outbreak, but they
may be rather uncertain. In Table 1, we also provide uncertainty measures, based on the boot-

strap procedures described in Section 3.1. It is also possible to compare the two employed
bootstrap approaches. They perform rather similarly (see also [26]) and the bootstrap intervals
are rather narrow, with France only showing a rather wide interval to indicate that its point
estimate should taken with caution.

Conclusions

Different capture-recapture approaches have been used to estimate the size of a partially observed
population; many parametric or semi-parametric models have been developed to estimate the
population size from aggregated counts leading to an approximation of the missed population
and/or to the estimate of the threshold under which the number of missed people cannot fall
(i.e. a lower bound). While several proposals for the latter exist, the estimation of an upper
bound in capture recapture methods has been often overlooked, with the exception of the recent
work of [23]. We propose an extension of the upper bound estimator under cumulative data
distributions, in an open population, such that a day-wise estimator varying over time. The
approach results in a time-aggregated approximation for f0 and thus for N . The proposed upper
bound estimator has been applied to registered cases in some European Countries; confidence
intervals for N have been provided by employing bootstrap approaches. We consider, for each
country, data up to the 17 of April, by assuming, given also the day wise nature of the estimator,
that the recoveries are negligible; however when dealing with cases and deaths at a more recent
date, given the increased percentage of immune people, recoveries should be taken into account
in the computation.Another issue which should be considered is the one concerning the role of
the deaths: even when the number of confirmed cases for two different Countries are close to each
other the upper bounds can be different according to the deaths size wrt the cases (i.e. France
and Spain). The length of the observation window plays an important role in this context and
according to the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 cases observed more than once, the distribution
can be less or more stable. It appears necessary to analyze this issue more deeply and we propose
