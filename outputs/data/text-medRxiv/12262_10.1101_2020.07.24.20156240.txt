Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Abstract

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has to
date affected over 13.3 million globally. Although high rates of venous thromboembolism
and evidence of COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction have been reported, the precise
aetiology of the increased thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 infection remains to be
fully elucidated.

Objectives
Here, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with
severe and non-severe COVID-19.

Methods
An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease
(requiring intensive care), patients with non-severe disease (not requiring intensive care),
general medical in-patients without COVID-19 and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet
function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis.
Results
We show that routine clinical blood parameters including increased MPV and decreased
platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon
hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release
was dramatically higher in COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 hospitalized
patients and circulating levels of PF4, sP-selectin and TPO were also significantly elevated in
COVID-19.
Conclusion
Distinct differences exist in routine full blood count and other clinical laboratory parameters
between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Moreover, we have determined that
COVID-19 patients possess hyperactive circulating platelets.

These data suggest that

abnormal platelet reactivity may contribute to hypercoagulability in COVID-19. Further
investigation of platelet function in COVID-19 may provide additional insights into the
aetiology of thrombotic risk in this disease and may contribute to the optimisation of
thrombosis prevention and treatment strategies.

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Introduction:

Over 13.3 million people globally have been infected since the outbreak of severe
acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; or COVID-19) in December 2019,
with over 578,000 fatalities reported to date (1). COVID-19 is characterised by a marked proinflammatory response with fever, elevated inflammatory markers and clinical & radiological
features of pneumonitis being evident among affected individuals (2). A complex interplay is
known to exist between pro-inflammatory pathway activity and blood coagulation activation;
this interplay appears to represent a source of morbidity among SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients, particularly among those with severe disease (3). Unexpectedly high levels of
venous thromboembolism (VTE) (4-10) have been reported in this patient group and levels of
D-dimer (a marker of increased blood coagulation activation) have been shown to correlate
with disease severity and appear to be predictive of mortality (11, 12). COVID-19 patients
with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes) have been indentified as being
particularly at risk of thrombotic events (13-16). Moreover, recent post-mortem studies have
shown evidence of widespread thrombosis in pulmonary vasculature and other organs (17,
18).

Anti-platelet drugs (such as aspirin) and anti-coagulants (such as low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH)) are known to be effective in the prevention and treatment of arterial and
venous thrombosis (19-21). High rates of VTE despite LMWH thromboprophylaxis have
been reported in COVID-19 and emerging reports of unusual or severe arterial thrombotic
events have been published (5, 18, 22-24). As both arterial and venous thrombosis can have
devastating consequences, efforts to determine the precise molecular mechanisms underlying
the unique hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 must be prioritised in order to optimise
preventative and therapeutic strategies (25, 26).

Circulating platelets, the activity of which are central to haemostasis and thrombosis, are now
understood to fulfill a much broader role in the regulation of a myriad of biological processes
including inflammation, wound healing and angiogenesis (27). Platelet-mediated immune
responses induced by viral infection have previously been reported (28-31) and a recent
report has demonstrated altered platelet gene expression profiles and functional responses in
patients infected with COVID-19 (32). Moreover, thrombocytopenia has been noted in

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

response to dengue (33, 34) and SARS-CoV infection (35) and among in-patients with
COVID-19, thrombocytopenia appears to be associated with increased risk of in-hospital
mortality (3, 36). Increased mean platelet volume (MPV), a sensitive indicator of circulating
platelet activity and a prognostic marker in thromboinflammation (37-39), has also been
reported in association with specific viral infections (40).
In the present study, we aimed to characterise patterns of platelet activity among patients
infected with COVID-19 relative to that observed in non-affected hospitalised patients in
order to determine if platelet dysfunction or hyperactivity contributes to COVID-19-induced
hypercoagulability.

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Methods:
Patient recruitment and blood collection
Ethical approval to proceed with this study (1/378/2077) was granted by the Institutional
Review Board of the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital.

Anonymised datasets

describing clinical laboratory parameters among hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19
(requiring critical care support), non-severe COVID-19 (not requiring critical care) and nonCOVID-19 affected medical inpatients were compiled from routine clinical testing results.
SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in all cases by RT-PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal
swab specimens. Informed consent was sought prior to obtaining additional blood samples
for analysis from a sub-group of patients with severe COVID-19, non-severe COVID-19 and
hospitalised patients without COVID-19, with patients matched for age, body mass index
(BMI) & gender. All patients were recruited at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital,
Dublin, Ireland. A group of healthly control donors were also recruited. Exclusion criteria
consisted of age <18 years and exposure to aspirin or other anti-platelet agents in the
preceding 2 weeks.
30 ml of blood was collected via venepuncture with a 21-gauge needle into a 10 mL acid
citrate dextrose (ACD) vacutainer and centrifuged (200 xg with no brake for 15 min at room
temperature (RT). Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was isolated and the pH adjusted to 6.5 with
ACD and supplemented with 1 μM PGE1. Platelets were then isolated from plasma by
centrifugation (600 × g for 10 min at RT) and platelet-poor-plasma was stored at -80oC.

Platelet ATP secretion assay
Isolated platelets from severe COVID-19 (n=6), non-severe COVID-19 (n=4) and
hospitalised control (n=3) patient groups and healthy controls (n=6) were washed using a
modified Tyrode’s buffer (130 mM NaCl, 9 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM
Trisodium citrate, 3 mM KCl, 0.81 mM KH2PO4, 9 mM MgCl2 x 6H2O; pH 7.4 with ACD)
followed by centrifugation (600 xg for 10 min at RT). Platelets were again resuspended in
modified Tyrode’s buffer and incubated at 37oC until the ATP secretion assay was
performed. Platelet counts were obtained so that the secretion assay results could be
normalised to 106 platelets/ml.

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

ATP secretion was measured using a luminescence-based assay, as previously described (4144). Agonists and buffer (5μl), were dispensed in duplicate into 96-well plates, together with
35μl of washed platelets and incubated for 3 minutes at 37 °C, with fast orbital shaking. The
doses of platelet agonists used to induce platelet ATP secretion were as follows; thrombin:
0.1 U/ml, 0.5 U/ml; U46619: 1 μM, 6.6 μM. Following incubation, 5μl of ATP detecting
reagent (chronolume; Labmedics, UK) was dispensed into each well and luminescence was
measured immediately using a Perkin Elmer 1420 96-well plate reader. Data was expressed
as the amount of ATP secreted, in luminescence arbitrary units (AU), and converted to
pmoles ATP released per 106 platelets by comparison with the luminescence recorded from an
ATP standard (0.4 mM).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
ELISAs for thrombopoietin (DTP00b), P-selectin (DPSE00), and platelet factor 4 (DPF40)
were purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK) and performed according to the
manufactures instructions. In brief, undiluted or 1:40 diluted platelet poor plasma (PPP) was
added in triplicate to wells for thrombopoietin and PF4, respectively. After incubation, the
plates were washed and incubated with the respective conjugate. For P-selectin, 1:20 diluted
PPP was added simultaneously with the P-selectin conjugate and incubated. Again, plates
were washed and the substrate added. The reaction was stopped with stop solution and the
optical density was determined at 450 nm within 30 minutes on a Dynex DS2 (Dynex
Technologies, Worthing, UK). Protein quantification was performed using a 4 parametric
logistic or log-logit regression.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.0.0) and SAS Viya© software (version
3.5). Data were tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed
continuous FBC data were presented as mean ± standard deviation and assessed for statistical
significance using a one-way ANOVA. Differences in ATP release and protein expression
were determined using a two-tailed t-test. In both cases, p-values were adjusted for multiple
comparisons using a Holm-Bonferroni post-hoc test. Categorical data were described as
percentages and significance was tested using a Fisher’s exact test. Values below 0.05 were
regarded as statistically significant. Data visualisation was performed using SAS Viya©.

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Results:
Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet-to-neutrophil ratio (PNR) are associated with
disease severity in COVID-19
Clinical laboratory data were available for 54 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection. Within this group, 34 patients had developed severe disease requiring transfer to
the intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilatory support while the remaining 20 patients did not
require critical care support at any stage during the course of their hospital admission.
Laboratory parameters relating to these two distinct subgroups of patients with COVID-19
(severe COVID-19, n=34; non-severe COVID-19, n=20) were compared to data from an age
and gender-matched cohort of hospitalised medical inpatients without COVID-19 (n=20).
Day of admission was defined as the day patients were admitted to the Mater Misericordiae
University Hospital.
In agreement with previous studies (45, 46), higher levels of D-dimer were observed on the
day of hospital admission among the patients who subsequently developed severe COVID-19
(mean±SD; 4.95±6.36 mg/L) in comparison (p=0.0.012) to that observed in the non-severe
COVID-19 group (1.01±0.75 mg/L) (Table 1). Furthermore, a significantly higher mean
platelet volume (MPV, p=0.015) and neutrophil count (p=0.013) in addition to a significantly
lower platelet-neutrophil ratio (PNR, p=0.0067) was noted on the day of admission in the
group of patients who subsequently developed a severe disease course relative to that seen in
the non-severe group (Fig. 1A). Interestingly these significant differences remained following
transfer to intensive care (Fig. 1B).
While platelet counts did not differ on the day of admission between patients subsequently
designated to have had either a severe or non-severe disease course (Fig. 1A), significantly
decreased platelet counts were observed among the severe COVID-19 patients at the time of
transfer to the ICU relative to the non-severe group (p=0.014, Fig. 1B). These findings are in
agreement with previous studies, which have suggested that a lower platelet count is
associated with severe COVID-19 (3, 47-49). An increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio
(NLR) in severe cases relative to non-severe was also detected at the time of hospital
admission (another previously reported predictor of disease severity) (Supplementary Fig. 1)
(47, 50, 51).

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Agonist-induced ADP release is dramatically higher in COVID-19 patients compared with
non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients.
Recently published data have suggested a crucial mechanistic role for platelets in the
pathophysiology of COVID-19 (18, 32, 52). We assessed dense granule release following
platelet activation with various platelet agonists. ATP secretion was used as a surrogate
marker for dense granule secretion, given that the ratio of ADP to ATP in platelet dense
granules is a constant 2:3 ratio (53).
Platelets from individuals within each group were isolated and activated with low and high
concentrations of thrombin and U46619. Platelets from COVID-19 patients exhibited
significantly higher levels of dense granule secretion when compared to both control cohorts
(HeC and HoC) with no significant difference between severe and non-severe COVID-19
patients (Fig. 2). Low doses of thrombin (0.1 U/ml) and U46619 (1 μM) induced minimal
activation in platelets isolated from healthy and hospitalised control patients. In contrast,
dramatically increased dense granule secretion was observed upon platelet activation in
patients with COVID-19 (Fig. 2A, 2C and Supplementary Table 2). Platelet stimulation with
0.1U/mL thrombin increased ADP-release 3-fold in COVID-19 patients compared with HeC
and HoC (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 2). Crucially, platelet activation with the
thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 (1µM) induced a 28-fold increase in ADP-release
in COVID-19 positive patients compared to HeC and strikingly, an 89-fold increase between
COVID-19 positive patients and HoC (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table 2). Platelet
stimulation with high-dose thrombin (0.5 U/ml) and U46619 (6.6 μM) induced a 2-fold and
10-fold increase respectively, in dense granule secretion from COVID-19 patients compared
to controls (Fig. 2B, 2D and Supplementary Table 2). These data suggest that platelets from
COVID-19 patients are more responsive to low dose agonist stimulation when compared to
control platelets, potentially indicating a reduced activation threshold in COVID-19 patients.

Circulating levels of PF4, sP-selectin and TPO are significantly elevated in COVID-19.
To further characterise this hyperactive platelet phenotype, circulating plasma markers of
platelet activity were measured in each of the above study groups (n=6 per group; plateletpoor plasma was available from an additional 2 non-severe COVID patients and an additional

3 hospitalised controls). Circulating levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4) were substantially
elevated in COVID-19 patients when compared to both hospitalised (HoC) and healthy
controls (HeC) (p=0.012 and p=0.0033, respectively; Fig. 3A). Nonetheless circulating PF4
levels could not differentiate between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient cohorts
(p=0.85). On the other hand, circulating levels of soluble P-selectin (sCD62P) also increased
in COVID-19 patients when compared to our control cohorts (Fig. 3B) and intriguingly,
could differentiate between our non-severe and severe COVID-19 cohorts (p=0.037),
suggesting that elevated sP-selectin may be associated with disease severity.
Increased thrombopoetin (TPO) levels have been reported in SARs-CoV infection and more
recently in COVID-19 (only in comparison to healthy controls) (54). Within our study
population, TPO levels were found to be significantly higher among patients with COVID-19
(combined severe and non-severe) compared to HeC (p=0.0021; Fig. 3C). No significant
difference in circulating TPO levels was noted between COVID-19 and HoC patients
(p=0.71; Fig. 3C). Interestingly, TPO levels between our severe and non-severe COVID-19
cohorts showed a clear trend towards elevated circulating TPO in severe COVID-19 infection
(p=0.052; Fig. 3C).

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Discussion
We have demonstrated that distinct platelet-related patterns in full blood count and other
clinical laboratory parameters appear to be associated with the development of a more severe
disease course in our cohort of COVID-19 patients, reflecting other recently published data
(2, 47, 55). Therewithal, we also report novel findings which indicate that COVID-19 is
associated with abnormal platelet reactivity. Our observations are likely to be of significant
clinical and translational relevance in view of the uncertainty that currently exists with
regards to the aetiology of thrombotic risk in COVID-19 and the optimal strategy for
prevention and treatment of thrombosis in this population.
In addition to the previously reported observations that neutrophilia, lymphopenia, elevated
D-dimer, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and elevated platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio
appear to be associated with severe disease, we have reported that within our cohort a
significantly lower platelet-to-neutrophil ratio was observed on the day of admission among
the COVID-19 patients who subsequently progressed to require critical care support (5, 11,
12, 47, 56). While platelet counts did not specifically differ between groups on day of
hospitalisation, we did observe increased levels of thrombopoietin in all COVID-19 positive
patients, potentially indicating the presence of a stimulus for increased thrombopoeisis in this
group. Moreover, a greater MPV was observed on the day of hospital admission in the group
of COVID-19 patients who subsequently developed a severe disease course requiring transfer
to intensive care.

Enlarged platelets express more platelet activation markers (57) and

contain more granules (58) and the release of such granular contents (e.g. thromboxane,
ADP and β-thromboglobulin) (59) can drive further platelet activation.
Other investigators have demonstrated increased platelet aggregation in response to low-dose
agonist stimulation in COVID-19 patients as well as increased platelet thromboxane
generation (32, 60). In line with these findings, we observed increased platelet responsiveness
(ADP release) to low-dose agonist stimulation, within our population of COVID-19 patients.
Intriguingly, previous reports have demonstrated similar patterns of enhanced platelet
reactivity in response to subthreshold concentrations of agonists in the presence of dengue
virus nonstructural protein 1 (34, 61), potentially indicating a virus-induced sensitisation of
platelets. As ADP/ATP and thromboxane A2 are locally-acting autocrine agonists which
rapidly amplify platelet activation triggering more release of platelet granule contents, our
findings provide further evidence that platelets from COVID-19 patients are more reactive, a
phenomenon which may contribute to thrombotic risk (4-10).

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

The circulating levels of the platelet activation markers PF4 and sP-selectin were highly
elevated among our cohort of COVID-19 positive patients compared to controls which futher
supports the hypothesis that COVID-19 is associated with enhanced platelet activation. The
elevated levels of TPO in COVID-19 also aligned with previous findings (32). While
circulating levels of PF4 did not differentiate between severe and non-severe COVID-19
cases, sP-selectin was higher among the severe COVID-19 group, in keeping with previous
reports (60, 62). Other investigators have also reported that sP-selectin levels were elevated
in COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (63), with even
higher levels detected in patients who subsequently died (64). The mechanism underlying
platelet activation in COVID-19 has been speculated to involve MAP kinase pathway (32)
and/or PKCδ (60) activation, however the initial trigger remains unidentified. Crucially, Zaid
et al. detected mRNA for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the membrane receptor
that facilitates SARS-CoV-2 internalisation, in platelets (60), but it remains to be determined
if platelets are directly infected by the virus. Potential alternative pathways may include
internalisation of the virus or the virus genome or binding to other cell surface receptors (e.g.
FcγRIIA or Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Nonintegrin), as observed with other viral infections (33, 65-68).
This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, our cohort of patients is relatively small, a
factor which (at least in part) is likely to be related to the success of the Irish healthcare
system in suppressing transmission of the virus during the early stages of the pandemic.
Additionally, given the public health restrictions that were in place during the period of this
study, recruitment of healthy controls was substantially impeded and consequently the
available healthy controls were not appropriately matched for age relative to our COVID-19
group and hospitalised control group. Due to the small sample size, adjustment for
confounding factors was not possible.
In conclusion, it has been apparent since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic that
derangements of haemostasis represent a hallmark of this disease and appear to be associated
with significant morbidity (12, 69). Several investigators have reported data suggesting that
rates of venous thromboembolism are high in this population and that these thrombotic
complications appear to occur despite compliance with standard VTE prevention protocols
(5, 7). Reports of unusual and devastating cases of arterial thrombosis are also emerging (18,
22-24). The safety and efficacy of conventional anti-platelet and anti-coagulant treatment
strategies in the management of this thrombotic risk is becoming a major focus of

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

translational and clinical interest. The aetiology of hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is likely
multi-factorial but it is presumed to be driven by the marked inflammatory response which
arises following infection (70, 71). It remains to be determined whether standard thrombosis
prevention strategies require modification in order to be effective in the prevention of
‘immunothrombosis’ in COVID-19 or if prevention strategies should focus instead on
addressing the ‘upstream’ inflammatory response driving coagulation activation. Our data
indicate that platelets from patients infected with COVID-19 display a hyperactive
phenotype, a factor which may contribute to thrombotic risk. Consequently, further
characterisation of platelet dysfunction in COVID-19 and the evaluation of anti-platelet
therapy as an adjunct to current thrombosis prevention measures is clearly warranted.

Platelet Activity in COVID-19

Figure Legends

Figure 1: Routinely clinical laboratory parameters are associated with disease severity
in COVID-19.
Platelet counts, MPV, Neutrophil counts and Platelet-to-neutrophil ratios of patients with
severe (n=34) or non-severe (n=20) COVID-19 and hospitalised controls (n=20). (A) On the
day of admission, patients who subsequently developed severe COVID-19 had significantly
higher MPV (p=0.015) and neutrophil counts (p=0.013) and significantly lower platelet-toneutrophil ratio (PNR, p=0.0067) compared to those who did not subsequently develop
severe COVID-19. (B) On day 7 of hospitalisation, non-severe COVID-19 patients had a
significantly higher platelet count compared to severe COVID-19 patients on the day of
transfer to intensive care (p=0.014). Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed ttest and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a Holm-Bonferroni post hoc
test.

Figure 2: Agonist-induced ADP release was dramatically higher in COVID-19 patients
compared with non-COVID-19 hospitalized patients.
Platelet dense granule release was measured in duplicate in severe (n=5) and non-severe
(n=4) COVID-19 patients compared to hospitalised (n=3) and healthy controls (n=6).
Platelets were stimulated with 0.1 U/ml thrombin (A), 0.5 U/ml thrombin (B), 1 µM U46619
(C), and 6.6 µM U46619 (D) and ATP release (surrogate for ADP) was measured using a
Chronolume luciferase assay. ADP release is expressed as pmol/106 platelets. Statistical
analysis was performed using a two-tailed t-test and p-values were adjusted for multiple
comparisons using a Holm-Bonferroni post hoc test.

Figure 3: Circulating levels of PF4, sP-selectin levels and TPO were significantly
elevated in COVID-19. (A) Platelet factor 4 (PF), (B) soluble P-selectin (sCD62P), and (C)
thrombopoietin (TPO) plasma levels from patients with severe (n=6) and non-severe (n=6)
COVID-19 compared to hospitalized (n=6) and healthy (n=6) controls were measured in
triplicate by ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed t-test and p-values
were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a Holm-Bonferroni post hoc test.
