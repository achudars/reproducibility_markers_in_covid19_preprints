Abstract

25

COVID-19 is characterised by dysregulated immune responses, metabolic dysfunction and

26

adverse effects on the function of multiple organs. To understand how host responses

27

contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we used a multi-omics approach to identify

28

molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples that distinguish COVID-19

29

patients experiencing a range of disease severities. A large number of expressed genes,

30

proteins, metabolites and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) were identified that exhibited strong

31

associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and

32

exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients, indicative of multi-organ damage.

33

The continuous activation of IFN-I signalling and neutrophils, as well as a high level of

34

inflammatory cytokines, were observed in severe disease patients. In contrast, COVID-19 in

35

mild patients was characterised by robust T cell responses. Finally, we show that some of

36

expressed genes, proteins and exRNAs can be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical

37

outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data refine our understanding of the

38

pathophysiology and clinical progress of COVID-19 and will help guide future studies in this

39

area.

Introduction

45

Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae) are a diverse group of positive-sense single-stranded

46

RNA viruses with enveloped virions (Cui et al., 2019; Masters and Perlman, 2013).

47

Coronaviruses are well known due to the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

48

(SARS) in 2002–2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, both of which

49

caused thousands of cases in multiple countries (Bermingham et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2019;

50

Ksiazek et al., 2003). Coronaviruses naturally infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts

51

including mammals and birds (Cui et al., 2019). As coronavirus primarily target epithelial cells,

52

they are generally associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory infections (Cui et al., 2019;

53

Masters and Perlman, 2013). In addition, they cause hepatic and neurological diseases of

54

varying severity (Masters and Perlman, 2013).

55

The world is currently experiencing a disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by a newly

56

identified coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 2020a). At the time of writing, there

57

have been more than 6 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 and over 387,000 deaths globally

58

(WHO, 2020). The disease leads to both mild and severe respiratory manifestations, with the

59

latter prominent in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as

60

cardiovascular and chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and cancer (Guan et al., 2020). In

61

addition to respiratory syndrome, mild gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular symptoms as

62

well as neurological manifestations have been documented in hospitalized COVID-19 patients

63

(Mao et al., 2020). Combined, these data point to multiple organ failures, and hence that

64

COVID-19 pathogenesis is complex, especially in patients experiencing severe disease.

65

It is believed that SARS-COV-2 is able to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2)

66

as a receptor for cell entry (Zheng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). ACE2 is attached to the

67

outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines

68

(Hamming et al., 2004). Additionally, ACE2 is expressed in Leydig cells in the testes (Jiang et

69

al., 2014) and neurological tissue (Baig et al., 2020). As such, it is possible that these organs

70

might also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may also

71

impact pathogenicity, resulting in severe tissue damage and, occasionally, death. Indeed,

72

several studies have reported lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes and cytokine storms in

73

COVID-19 patients (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Cao, 2020). Numerous clinical studies have

74

also observed the elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-6, troponin I, inflammatory

75

markers and D-dimer in COVID-19 patients (Wang et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2020a). However,

76

despite the enormous burden of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, we know little

77

about its pathophysiology, even though this establishes the basis for successful clinical

78

practice, vaccine development and drug discovery.

79

Using a multi-omics approach employing cutting-edge transcriptomic, proteomic and

80

metabolomic technologies we identified significant molecular alterations in patients with

81

COVID-19 compared to uninfected controls in this study. Our results refine the molecular view

82

of COVID-19 pathophysiology associated with disease progression and clinical outcome.

86

We studied 66 clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized

87

at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, China between January 31st and

88

April 7th, 2020 (Fig. 1A, Tables S1 and S2). At the time of writing, 55 (49 mild and 6 severe) of

89

the 66 patients have recovered and been discharged following treatment, while five patients

90

(1 mild and 4 severe) remain in the hospital and are receiving ongoing treatment.

91

Unfortunately, six patients (all severe) died.

92

Molecular variation associated with COVID-19 pathophysiology

93

Serial blood and throat swab samples were collected from all patients, as well as from 17

94

healthy volunteers. To determine whether COVID-19 pathophysiology was associated with

95

particular molecular changes, a total of 23,373 expressed genes, 9,439 proteins, 327

96

metabolites and 769 exRNAs were examined using a multi-omics approach combining

97

transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (Fig. 1B). Compared with healthy controls,

98

mild and severe patients had significantly different expression patterns (higher or lower) in

99

6.79% and 26.0% of expressed genes, 52.1% and 51.7% of proteins, 7.34% and 15.6% of

100

metabolites and 39.9% and 20.5% of exRNAs, respectively (Fig. 1C, Tables S3-S6).

101

Significant differences in the principal component 1 (PC1), PC2 and/or PC3 between healthy

102

controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients were observed (Figs. 2A and S1A). Remarkably,

103

there were significant correlations between multi-omics data and classical blood and

104

biochemical parameters (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the molecular changes identified directly

105

impact the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

106

The correlation between molecular variation and COVID-19 pathophysiology was best

107

reflected in the proteomic analysis (Fig. 2). Specifically, there was significant downregulation

108

in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and glycolytic pathways in both mild and severe patients

109

compared to healthy controls (Figs. 2C and S1B). However, the hypoxia-inducible factors

110

(HIF-1) signaling pathways and well-known host defense pathways (e.g., T cell receptor

111

signaling pathway, ISG15 antiviral signaling pathway) were elevated in these patients (Figs.

112

2C and S1B). Additionally, we identified 14 co-expression groups (“modules”) of proteins that

113

were highly correlated to clinical parameters (Fig. 2D). Module 1, comprising 12 proteins, was

114

strongly associated with activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (Fig. 2E), with their

115

downregulated expression likely indicating higher APTT values. In contrast, levels of plasma

116

IL-6 and IL-10 in patients were positively correlated with the expression of proteins in module

117

15 (Fig. 2F). Notably, correlations between the proteins in these modules were also identified,

118

suggesting that proteins may interact in defining clinical outcome (Figs. S2C and S2D). In

119

addition to proteins, lipoprotein variation was also significantly correlated with immune

120

changes including IgG, monocytes and procalcitonin (Fig. 2B). Combined, these data reveal a

121

significant association between specific molecular variations and COVID-19 pathophysiology.

122

Tissue damage caused by SARS-CoV-2

123

Recent data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with multi-tissue injury and

124

organ damage (Wu et al., 2020b; Zheng et al., 2020).Compared to healthy controls, intensive

125

alteration of tissue-enhanced proteins were observed in all COVID-19 patients, suggestive of

126

multiple organ dysfunction including the lung, liver, brain, testis and intestine (Figs. 3A and 3I).

127

Notably, the majority of proteins related to organ function were downregulated in COVID-19

128

patients (Fig. 3B). As expected, lung-enhanced proteins varied significantly in the plasma of

129

both mild and severe patients. Likely because lung-enhanced proteins are not rich in the

130

human protein atlas, the lung-enhanced proteins in either mild or severe patients did not

131

achieve the top rank. Nevertheless, lung abnormality was reflected in the activation of the

132

HIF-1 signaling pathway and reactive oxygen species metabolic processes in all patients (Fig.

133

3D). Liver- and brain-enhanced proteins also varied significantly, followed by those from the

134

testis, intestine and other organs, suggesting that these organs might also be seriously

135

affected (Fig. 3A). Severe brain dysfunction was reflected in the significant decline of

136

brain-enhanced proteins regulating neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmitter transport,

137

and the numbers of neurotransmitter receptors, as well as a significant decrease in proteins

138

including ENO1, MBP and NEFM that are known biomarkers to reflect brain dysfunction (Figs.

139

3C and 3F). Liver-enhanced proteins, that regulate the transportation of sterol and cholesterol,

140

were downregulated, while those involved in acute inflammatory response were elevated in

141

both mild and severe patients (Fig. 3E). Testis-enhanced proteins involved in the cell cycle and

142

cell proliferation were upregulated in all male patients, although proteins (e.g. YBX2)

143

associated with reproduction were significantly downregulated. Heart specific proteins related

144

to cardia muscle contraction and oxidative reduction were reduced in COVID-19 patients (Fig.

145

3H). Finally, variation in tissue-enhanced proteins was also associated with COVID-19 severity.

146

For example, brain-enhanced proteins enriched in tubulin accumulation were upregulated in

147

mild disease patients, indicating multiple neuron cell apoptosis in these patients. However,

148

proteins significantly upregulated in severe patients were enriched in liver steatosis AOP and

149

in multi-drug resistance factors (Figs. S2A and S2B).

150

Organ dysfunction was also reflected in the relative proportion of different cell

151

populations. We identified 16 cell types whose abundance changed significantly following

152

virus infection (Fig. 3F). For example, the set of proteins expressed by alveolar type 1/2

153

epithelial cells (AT1 and AT2) were significantly downregulated in all patients (Fig. 3G). In

154

addition, the majority of tissue-injury related exRNAs across all tissues showed differential

155

expression, including lung (55 in 92 pre-identified, p<0.0001), kidney (14 in 22, p<0.0001),

156

liver (17 in 22, p<0.0001), brain (8 in 16, p=0.0016) and heart (5 in 6, p<0.0001) (Fig. S2C).

157

Furthermore, a large proportion of tissue-injury related exRNAs were expressed differently in

158

mild and severe patients in most tissues analyzed (30/92 in lung, 10/22 in kidney, 8/22 in liver

159

and 3/6 in heart), except brain (1/16) (data not shown). Together, our data indicate that

160

COVID-19 causes adverse functions in multiple organs including lung damage.

161

Immunopathological changes in COVID-19 patients

162

Immune responses can cause severe damage to the cells or tissues that defend hosts against

163

viral infection (Baseler et al., 2017; Cicchese et al., 2018; Newton et al., 2016). Analysis of

164

whole blood transcriptomic data revealed that gene sets, including an antiviral IFN signature

165

(M75 module), were enriched at the first sampling timepoint (Fig. 4A, Table S7). Notably, IFN

166

signaling was continuously activated in severe patients during the entire period of

167

hospitalization (Fig. 4A), while negative regulators of innate immune signaling (e.g. TRIM59,

168

USP21 and NLRC3) were downregulated (Fig. S3A). Additionally, significant increases of IL-6,

169

IL-8 and IL-10 levels were detected in severe patients compared to mild patients (Figs. 2F

170

and S3B). Combined, these data suggest that the continuous activation of IFN-I signaling and

171

a high level of inflammatory cytokines likely impact COVID-19 immunopathology.

172

Higher neutrophil counts were observed in severe patients but not in mild patients during

173

hospitalization (Fig. S3C). Examination of the neutrophil transcriptomic signatures revealed

174

that excessive neutrophil activation was associated with severe rather than mild disease.

175

These markers involved those utilized in neutrophil chemotaxis, activation and migration (Fig.

176

S3D). Notably, genes encoding molecules associated with neutrophil extracellular traps

177

(NETs) were significantly upregulated in severe disease patients (Fig. 4B). As excess NETs

178

formation can lead to tissue damage (Kruger et al., 2015), our data imply that the excessive

179

activation of neutrophils may contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis.

180

As in the case of influenza viruses that can be cleared by strong T cell responses (van de

181

Sandt et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015), SARS-CoV-2 immunity in mild patients was

182

characterized by a robust T cell response, reflected in T cell signaling activation (M7.3 module,

183

M35.1 module) and T cell differentiation (M19 module) on admission, followed by subsequent

184

rapid reduction (Fig. 4A). However, severe patients lost ~59.1% of their total T cell population,

185

62.3% of their CD4 T cells and 52.8% of their CD8 T cells. Importantly, the CD4 T cell

186

population gradually recovered in the severe-survivors compared to the severe-fatality group

187

(Fig. S3E). Additionally, T cells in the survivors were primed by dendritic cells and expressed

188

high levels of IFNG and GZMB (Fig. 4C). T cell dysfunction was observed in the severe group,

189

which could in part be due to an inhibitory status based on the expression levels of multiple

190

exhaustion markers (Fig. S3F). Strikingly, the severe disease group had a greater abundance

191

of ARG1 (Fig. S3G). Finally, the mild group had higher TCR diversity than the severe group

192

(Fig. S3H). In sum, our data suggest that the T cell response is indispensable to successful

193

host defense against SARS-CoV-2.

194

Finally, we investigated the immune signatures associated with poor COVID-19

195

prognosis. Notably, KEGG functional analysis revealed that gene sets of the “IL-17 signaling

196

pathway” were significantly enriched in the severe-fatality group. Further analysis of the

197

signature components revealed that p38 MAPK activation was dominant in fatal cases, while

198

higher levels of IL13 and IFNG were present in survivors (Fig. 4D). These gene signatures

199

might contribute to greater neutrophil influx (CXCL2 and CXCL6) and inflammation (S100A8),

200

and could be detrimental in the severe disease group (Fig. 4E).

201

Comprehensive changes in lipoprotein metabolism in COVID-19 patients

202

To reveal metabolic changes in COVID-19 patients, we quantified 348 metabolite parameters

203

in small metabolites, lipoprotein subclasses and their compositional components. The PCA

204

scores plot revealed an obvious metabolomic trajectory from mild to severe COVID-19, and

205

gradually away from healthy controls (Fig. 5A). Such group-clustering patterns were

206

independently confirmed by PCA scores plots from all NMR-detectable metabolite signals, all

207

MS-detectable signals for lipids, and hydrophilic molecules in plasma samples (Figs.

208

S4A-S4D). Our data therefore indicate that a concentration of changes in plasma metabolites

209

are associated with COVID-19 severity.

210

Further statistical analyses highlighted the major changes in the levels of lipoprotein

211

sub-classes and their compositional components including LDL1 (L1TG), LDL4, VLDL5,

212

HDL1 and HDL4 (Figs. 5C and S4E). Compared with healthy controls, the level of

213

triglycerides (TG) in LDL1 and free cholesterol (FC) in all VLDL5 lipids were significantly

214

elevated in both mild and severe patients, while there were significant decreases in LDL4 and

215

LDL5, cholesterol in LDL, cholesterol esters in VLDL5, Apo-A2 in both HDL and nascent HDL,

216

FC in HDL1 together with total cholesterol and phospholipids (PL). Interestingly, HDL4 and its

217

components had significant lower levels in severe patients. Compared with mild patients,

218

L1TG and PL in HDL1 was increased in severe patients, while cholesterol in HDL1 and HDL2,

219

HDL4 and its components decreased (Fig. S4F). Fortunately, most of these lipoproteins

220

recovered following patients discharge (Figs. 5B, 5C and S4D).

221

The levels of some key proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism, including the

222

soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor (sLDLR), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)

223

and the cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP), were significantly reduced in mild and

224

severe COVID-19 patients than those in healthy controls (Figs. 5D and 5E). Additionally,

225

enzymes such as ACO2, IDH, OGDH, DLD, SDH and MDH in the TCA cycle were lower in

226

COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, while the enzymes central to fatty acid

227

synthesis (Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase [ACAC] and Fatty acid synthetase [FASN]) were

228

elevated. Finally, significant concurrent elevations in plasma lactate and LDH were

229

observable in patients compared to healthy controls (Figs. 5E, S4G and S4H). In sum, these

230

data reveal the dysregulation in lipoprotein metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle during

231

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

232

Viral load is associated with disease prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients

233

The severity and clinical outcome of COVID-19 were also associated with viral load. Overall,

234

SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads on admission were significantly higher in the throat swabs of the five

235

fatal cases compared to those who survived (mean, 1.26×105 vs 3.98×103 copies/mL,

236

respectively; p = 0.04) (Fig. 6A). Although viral load declined during the period of

237

hospitalization in both survival and fatal cases, it remained elevated in fatal cases compared

238

to survivors.

239

Estimation of the correlation coefficient between viral load and protein expression

240

revealed that proteins participating in antiviral processes, including the TCR and BCR

241

signaling pathway, were positively associated with viral load changes in severe-survivors.

242

Additionally, proteins participating in viral life cycle processes, including viral messenger RNA

243

synthesis and innate immune responses, were only positively associated with viral load

244

changes in the severe-fatal group (Fig. 6E). Notably, proteins (e.g., FASN, ACSS2, CPT1A,

245

HADHB) involved in pathways including mitochondrial function, lipid metabolic process,

246

steroid hormone process and TCA cycle were continuously upregulated in the severe-survivor

247

compared to the severe-fatal group (Figs. 6B and 6C). However, this upregulation was only

248

observed during the early stage following admission in the severe-fatal group. Surprisingly,

249

proteins related to viral life cycle, viral RNA synthesis, oxidative stress (e.g., EIF, EIFB,

250

RPL19, SLCA24), were downregulated in the several-survivor cases following admission, but

251

maintained high levels in the severe-fatal patients (Figs. 6B and 6D). Hence, SARS-CoV-2

252

may exploit host resources over the duration of its infection.

253

Biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients

254

As many molecules associated with COVID-19 pathophysiology were identified, we

255

investigated whether particular molecular changes could be used as biomarkers to predict

256

clinical outcomes. Using an unsupervised PCA, the exRNA, mRNA, proteomics and the

257

corresponding clinical covariate data sets across all time-points, or a subset from the first

258

time-point, clustered into three clinical phenotypes: (i) samples from healthy controls; (ii)

259

samples from COVID-19 patients with a good prognosis; and (iii) samples from COVID-19

260

patients with a poor prognosis (Methods; Fig. 7A). Given this, prognostic classification models

261

were constructed. Predictive models based on all four types of data worked well, especially

262

those utilizing the clinical covariates and the proteomic data (Fig. S5), suggesting that all four

263

types of data collected at admission contain key prognostic information.

264

In addition, we identified robust predictive models and prognostic biomarkers from

265

each of the four types of data using a previously described approach (Shi et al., 2010) (Figs.

266

7B and 7C). One or two features (expressed genes, proteins, exRNAs, and biochemical

267

parameters) in each data set were able to clearly separate patients into two groups

268

characterized by different prognoses (Figs. 7D-7I). Poor prognosis was associated with

269

increased levels of D-dimer (p=0.004) and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP; p=0.02),

270

and with a decrease in F13A1 expression (p<0.002; Figs. 7H and 7I), suggesting that blood

271

clotting status may be one of the key factors to monitor in COVID-19 progression. For the

mRNA-based model, poor prognosis was associated with lower levels of CD3E and higher

273

levels of OLAH, and hence highly concordant with immune responses in COVID-19 patients

274

(Fig. 7E). Additionally, exRNA-based predictors included members of the let-7 family (Figs.7D

275

and 7E). Finally, the protein-based models highlighted features enriched in extracellular

276

exosomes, lipoprotein metabolic processes, innate immune responses, and blood

277

coagulation (Figs. 7G and 7H).

Discussion

280

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on a global scale (WHO, 2020). Despite

281

the enormous burden or morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, we know little about its

282

pathophysiology, even though this establishes the basis for successful clinical practice,

283

vaccine development and drug discovery. Current clinical practice may be unable to provide a

284

precision supportive therapy when a novel disease like COVID-19 emerges, in part explaining

285

the high case fatality rates often observed at the beginning of outbreaks (Alonso et al., 2019).

286

We used a multi-omics approach to identify numerous expressed genes, proteins,

287

metabolites and exRNAs from COVID-19 patients with a range of disease severities, and that

288

were significantly correlated with key clinical features as well as to classic blood and

289

biochemical parameters (Fig. 2). These data therefore provide a comprehensive molecular

290

view of the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Finally, based on our multi-omics data (Fig. S6),

291

mild and severe COVID-19 cases may need different therapeutic strategies.

292

COVID-19 severity and clinical outcome was significantly associated with multi-organ

293

damage. Due to the widespread presence of ACE2 in humans (Chai et al., 2020; Chen et al.,

294

2020b; Fan et al., 2020; Hamming et al., 2004; Zou et al., 2020), SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect

295

many organs (Wadman et al., 2020). In addition to pneumonia (Wu et al., 2020a; Zhou et al.,

296

2020b), several clinical studies have reported mild gastrointestinal, cardiovascular symptoms

297

and neurological manifestations in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Baig, 2020; Chen et al.,

298

2020a; Guan et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).

299

Histopathologic investigation has also described damage in other organs in addition to the

300

lung (Barton et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Wadman et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020c). The

301

molecular data generated here support the occurrence of damage in multiple organs including

302

lung, liver, brain, heart in COVID-19 patients, and also identify damage in other organs

303

including the testis (Fig. 3). In the case of brain and testis damage, a key issue is how

304

SARS-CoV-2 is able to cross the blood-brain or the blood-testis barriers? One possibility

305

might be that heparin was prescribed for coaggregation problems commonly observed in

306

some COVID-19, even though it increases permeability (Gautam et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2020;

307

Oschatz et al., 2011). More importantly, the alteration (up- or down-regulated) of

308

tissue-enhanced proteins and tissue-damage related exRNAs are significantly correlated with

309

clinical severity and outcome.

310

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in acute lung injury (ALI) in patients, with ground-glass

311

opacity in most computed tomography (CT) reports from our facility and in other hospitals

312

(Chen et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020). Autopsy disclosed histologic

313

changes in lungs included edema, fibrinous/proteinaceous exudates, hyperplastic

314

pneumocytes, patchy inflammation, multinucleated giant cells and diffuse alveolar damage

315

(Barton et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020). The data generated here revealed that the number of

316

AT1 and AT2 cells reduced significantly in severe patients, suggesting destruction of the

317

alveolar epithelium (Fig. 3F), which in turn will lead to the accumulation alveolar fluid and

318

hence cause hypoxia (Vadász and Sznajder, 2017). In addition, we also noted that HIF1a

319

signaling was modified which may further worsen ALI (Dada et al., 2003). Thus, our molecular

320

data suggest that removal of excess alveolar fluid and the restoration of alveolar structure will

321

be of major clinical importance.

322

Our data also identified immune pathophysiology a factor that greatly impacted

323

COVID-19 clinical outcome. The innate immune response against viruses is mounted

324

immediately after a host acquires a viral infection, whereas there is a delay before the onset of

325

adaptive immunity (Murphy and Weaver, 2016). Unlike SARS-CoV and influenza virus,

326

SARS-CoV-2 may be present in patients for longer time periods, especially those with severe

327

syndrome (Du et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Several studies have reported that severe

328

COVID-19 patients experienced lymphopenia, impaired adaptive immunity, uncontrolled

329

inflammatory innate responses, and cytokine storms (Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020;

330

Qin et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b). While it is believed that T cells play an

331

important role in fighting the infection in the case of Ebola virus, influenza virus and

332

SARS-CoV (Channappanavar et al., 2014; Ruibal et al., 2016; Sridhar et al., 2013; van de

333

Sandt et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2010), a role for T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection not yet has

334

been determined, likely reflecting “lymphopenia” (Wang et al., 2020d; Zhou et al., 2020c).

335

Our longitudinal analyses provided evidence that patients with mild or severe symptoms

336

who succeeded in T cell mobilization promptly controlled SARS-CoV-2 infection and

337

symptoms (Figs. 2C, 4A and 4C). In contrast, those (especially severe-fatal) patients that

338

failed to mount a sound T cell response maintained a continuous pro-inflammatory response

339

and suffered from cytokine storms as well as excess NETs (Figs. 4A and 4B), both of which

340

are known to cause systematic tissue damages (Akiyama et al., 2019; Bohmwald et al., 2019).

341

In sum, our data indicate that T cells play a key role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection.

342

It is believed that p38 signaling, collagenase (MMP9), neutrophil chemo-attractants

343

(CXCL2 and CXCL6) and S100A8 are autoinflammation-like signatures (Cheng et al., 2019;

344

Chung, 2011; Halayko and Ghavami, 2009; Mattos et al., 2002). Remarkably, these

345

molecules were significantly upregulated in severe-fatal in comparison to mild and

346

severe-survival patients (Fig. 4D), the former of which also exhibited a persistent elevation of

347

type I interferon responses (Fig. 4A). Together, the data generated here indicate that

348

autoinflammation may amplify disease in very severe cases of COVID-19.

349

Patients will receive better and precision therapy if we are able to identify molecular

350

biomarkers associated with prognosis at the beginning of disease presentation. For example,

351

a 21-gene expression assay, which can predict clinical outcome, is used in the case of breast

352

cancer (Sparano et al., 2018). To date, however, almost no biomarkers have been used to

353

accurately predict prognosis in the case of emerging infectious diseases (Wynants et al.,

354

2020). In this study, some of molecules identified at the beginning phase of COVID-19 were

355

significantly correlated to both classical blood and biochemical parameters, and more

356

importantly to disease severity. Based on our previous work (Shi et al., 2010; Su et al., 2014a;

357

Zhang et al., 2015), we established classification models based on each of four data types:

358

exRNAs, mRNA, proteins, and biochemical parameters. Notably, COVID-19 clinical outcomes

359

could be accurately predicted using just one or two biomarkers in each data type. In addition,

360

these biomarkers may have biological functions directly relevant to COVID-19

361

pathophysiology. For example, biomarkers let-7 family from exRNAs, OLAH and CD3E from

362

mRNAs, and C4A and C4B from proteomes concordantly revealed the importance of T-cell

363

activation and the suppression inflammatory responses. However, because of the relatively

364

small patient sample size utilized here, it is clear that more work is needed to confirm the

365

reliability and practicality these biomarkers.

366

In sum, we have identified a large number of molecules associated with COVID-19

367

pathophysiology, some of which may also be effective predictive biomarkers of clinical

368

outcome at the onset of disease. In addition, these data suggest that both distinct immune

369

responses and multi-organ damage have a major impact on COVID-19 severity and disease

370

prognosis.

374

According to arrangements made by the Chinese Government, all adult patients in Shanghai

375

diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. We

376

enrolled 66 COVID-19 patients who were treated at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical

377

Center between January 31st and April 7th, 2020. Based on clinical signs and the need for

378

oxygen, these patients were divided into two groups: (i) mild (50/66, 75.8%) – with clinical

379

signs of pneumonia but without oxygen support, and (ii) severe (16/66, 24.2%) – with oxygen

380

support using non-invasive ventilation, tracheal tube, tracheotomy assist ventilation or

381

extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Fig. 1A and Table S1). All human samples

382

included in the present study were obtained after approval of the research by the Shanghai

383

Public Health Clinical Center Ethics Committee (YJ-2020-S018-02), together with the written

384

informed consent from each patient.

385

Sample collection and processing

386

A total of 277 blood samples, comprising 1-2 mL each, were collected by professional

387

healthcare workers over a 5-week period, with one to five sampling time points from each

388

patient. In addition, 17 blood samples were collected from 17 uninfected volunteers and

389

utilized as healthy controls. Samples were transported to the research laboratory within two

390

hours of collection. For RNA extraction, 200 μL of whole blood was mixed with 1 mL QRIzol

391

reagent (Qiagen), followed by 15 min incubation at room temperature and subsequent

392

freezing at -80°C before total RNA extraction. The remaining whole blood samples (800-1800

393

μL) were processed immediately to separate plasma and subsequently stored at -80°C until

394

use.

395

All clinical data were recorded by the clinicians. COVID-19 loads were determined by

396

quantitative real-time RT-PCR using the Takara One Step PrimeScript RT–PCR kit (Takara

397

RR064A) as previously described (Wu et al., 2020a). Quantitative viral load tests were

398

performed using the BioDigital General dPCR kit (Jiangsu Saint Genomics, Cat no.

399

CSJ-3-0018).

400

RNA and exRNA extraction and library construction

401

Total RNA from whole blood samples was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit

402

(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of RNA solution

403

were assessed using a Qubit Flex fluorometer (Invitrogen) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent

404

Technologies) before library construction and sequencing. RNA library construction was

405

performed as described using the VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina

406

(Vazyme, China). Ribosomal, globin and RN7S RNAs were depleted using specially designed

407

probes (Vazyme, China).

408

Plasma samples were divided into aliquots and used for extracellular RNA (exRNA)

409

extraction and library construction, protein extraction and metabolomic analyses. For exRNA

410

library preparation, total RNA including exRNA was extracted using the miRNeasy

411

Serum/Plasma Advanced Kit (Qiagen). The exRNA library was prepared using the NEXTflex

412

Small RNA-seq Kit v3 (PerkinElmer). RNA quantity and quality were determined as

libraries (RNA and exRNA) were pair-end (150-bp reads) sequenced on the Illumina

NovaSeq6000 platform (Illumina).

417

RNA-seq data analysis

418

Data processing and filtering criteria

419

Preliminary processing of raw reads was performed using FASTP v0.19.6 to remove adapter

420

sequences and obtain trimmed reads (Chen et al., 2018). The sequence

421

AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA was used as the R1 adapter sequence

422

while AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT was used as the R2 adapter

423

sequence. HISAT2 v2.1 (Pertea et al., 2016) was used for read alignment to the human

424

genome, build 38. Samtools v1.3.1 was used to generate intermediate result files for quality

425

assessment of the aligned reads by BamQC v2.0.0 (https://github.com/s-andrews/BamQC)

426

and insert size distribution analysis. The assembly of aligned reads and assessment of

427

expression levels were processed through StringTie v1.3.4. Gene counts were determined

428

with preDE.py (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/) based on results derived from Ballgown

429

(https://github.com/alyssafrazee/ballgown). Ensembl transcript annotation (version:

430

Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.93.gtf) with 58,395 genes was used.

431

A QC analysis and library filtering were performed before downstream biological

432

analysis. Libraries that passed the following criteria were retained: (i) more than five million

433

reads; (ii) more than 90% of reads aligned to the human reference genome; (iii) over 10,000

434

genes were expressed (a gene with FPKM>0.5 was identified as an expressed gene). In

435

addition, to monitor data quality across batches, libraries of some heathy control samples

436

were constructed and sequenced 2-3 times. The average expression profile of the multiple

437

libraries from each heathy control sample were calculated for follow-up analyses.

438

Immunoassay

439

Immune repertoires were extracted with MiXCR, a software tool that extracts T-cell receptor

440

(TCR) and immunoglobulin (IG) repertoires from RNA-seq data (Bolotin et al., 2017; Bolotin et

441

al., 2015). The number of clonotypes was then calculated using VDJtools, using the output

442

from MiXCR (Shugay et al., 2015).

443

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)

444

To identify DEGs, a Student’s t-test was applied to the expression matrix. Genes with p-values

445

less than 0.05 as well as a fold change >2 or <1/2 were labeled as up-regulated and

446

down-regulated genes, respectively (Su et al., 2014b). This straightforward approach of

447

combining a fold change cut-off with a non-stringent p-value threshold has been

448

demonstrated to yield reproducible and robust lists of DEGs for both microarray and RNA-seq

449

based gene-expression analyses (Shi et al., 2006; Su et al., 2014b).

450

Functional and cell type enrichment analyses

451

Functional analyses were conducted based on genes differentially expressed between

452

several subgroups of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy control samples. GSEA

453

(Gene Set Enrichment Analyses) was performed to identify significantly enriched functional

454

classes of gene sets correlated with blood transcription modules (BTM) described by Li et al.

455

(2014), KEGG pathways, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A default FDR (false discovery rate)

456

value of q<0.25 was considered statistically significant. The Normalized Enrichment Score

457

(NES) of significant immune modules from BTMs was used to denote enrichment levels.

458

The fraction of the cell subsets was calculated using the enrichment-score based

459

algorithm xCell from the RNA-seq data (Aran et al., 2017). Briefly, the expression profile

460

(FPKM) of all 230 samples was employed as raw signatures. The R package immunedeconv

461

was applied to obtain enrichment scores of 35 immune cell types, estimating immune cell

462

fractions including T cell, monocyte and neutrophil by summation of the scores in each

463

sample (Sturm et al., 2019).

464

exRNA-seq data analysis

465

Alignment, quantification and quality control

466

Libraries were sequenced in two batches, with an average sequencing depth of 15.7M raw

467

reads per library. All FASTQ files were delivered to the ExceRpt small RNA sequencing data

468

analysis pipeline (docker v4.6.3) (Rozowsky et al., 2019). Default parameters were used with

469

exception of: (i) the sequence TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG was given as the 3’adapter

470

sequence, ignoring the adapter sequences guessed by the pipeline; (ii) the random barcode

471

length was set to 4; (iii) the priority of the reference libraries during read assignment was set

472

to miRNA > piRNA > tRNA > GENCODE > circRNA (Godoy et al., 2018). Pre-compiled

473

genome and transcriptome indices of human genome, build 38 were used. The raw read

474

count matrix was then normalized using count per million (CPM).

475

A QC analysis was performed prior to biological analysis by removing (i) libraries with

476

low sequencing depths (<1M raw reads); (ii) libraries with mapping ratio lower than 50%, and

477

(iii) libraries with low transcript-genome ratios. To minimize the impact of noise due to low

478

expression levels, only 769 miRNAs with at least 1 count per million in no less than 10% of the

479

total number of samples were included in the final analysis.

480

Differentially expressed exRNAs

481

To identify differentially expressed exRNAs, Student’s t-tests were applied to the normalized

482

expression matrix. exRNAs with p-values less than 0.05, as well as fold change > 2 or < 1/2,

483

were labeled as up-regulated and down-regulated exRNAs, respectively, in a similar manner

484

to the RNA-seq data.

485

Tissue-damage related miRNAs

486

exRNAs reported to be associated with tissue damage were collected from publications (Atif

487

and Hicks, 2019; Godwin et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2009; Zhou et al.,

488

2016)(Table S8). Fisher’s exact test was used to determine whether the proportions of

489

differentially expressed (DE) exRNAs in tissue-damage related exRNAs were significantly

490

higher than the proportions of DE exRNAs in the entire data set of 769 miRNAs.

Plasma samples used for protein extraction were first removed the tip 14 highest abundance

496

was digested by trypsin at an enzyme to protein mass ratio of 1:25 overnight at 37°C, and the

497

peptides were then extracted and dried (SpeedVac, Eppendorf).

LC-MS/MS Acquisition of Plasma Samples

499

Samples were measured using LC-MS instrumentation consisting of an EASY- nLC 1200

500

ultra-high-pressure system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled via a nano-electrospray ion

501

source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to a Fusion Lumos Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

502

peptides were dissolved with 12 μl loading buffer (0.1% formic acid in water), and 5 μl was

503

loaded onto a 100 μm I.D. × 2.5 cm, C18 trap column at a maximum pressure 280 bar with 14

504

μl solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water). Peptides were separated on 150 μm I.D. × 15 cm

505

column (C18, 1.9μm, 120 A, Dr. Maisch GmbH) with a linear 15–30% Mobile Phase B (ACN

506

and 0.1% formic acid) at 600 nl/min for 75 mins. The MS analysis was performed in a

507

data-independent manner. The DIA method consisted of MS1 scan from 300-1400 m/z at 60k

508

resolution (AGC target 4e5 or 50 ms). Then 30 DIA segments were acquired at 15k resolution

509

with an AGC target 5e4 or 22 ms for maximal injection time. The setting “inject ions for all

510

available parallelizable time” was enabled. HCD fragmentation was set to normalized collision

511

energy of 30%. The spectra were recorded in profile mode. The default charge state for the

512

MS2 was set to 3.

513

Peptide identification and protein quantification

514

All data were processed using Firmiana (Feng et al., 2017).The DDA data were search

515

against UniProt human protein database (updated on 2019.12.17, 20406 entries) using

516

FragPipe (v12.1) with MSFragger (2.2) (Kong et al., 2017). The mass tolerances were 20 ppm

for precursor and 50 mmu for product ions. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed. The

518

search engine set cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification and N-acetylation

519

and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. Precursor ion score charges were

520

limited to +2, +3, and +4. The data were also searched against a decoy database so that

521

protein identifications were accepted at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. The results of

522

DDA data were combined into spectra libraries using SpectraST software. A total of 327

523

libraries were used as reference spectra libraries.

524

DIA data was analyzed using DIANN (v1.7.0) (Demichev et al., 2020). The default

525

settings were used for DIA-NN (Precursor FDR: 5%, Log lev: 1, Mass accuracy: 20 ppm, MS1

526

accuracy: 10 ppm, Scan window: 30, Implicit protein group: genes, Quantification strategy:

527

robust LC (high accuracy). Quantification of identified peptides was calculated as the average

528

of chromatographic fragment ion peak areas across all reference spectra libraries. Label-free

529

protein quantifications were calculated using a label-free, intensity-based absolute

530

quantification (iBAQ) approach (Zhang et al., 2012). We calculated the peak area values as

531

parts of corresponding proteins. The fraction of total (FOT) was used to represent the

532

normalized abundance of a particular protein across samples. FOT was defined as a protein’s

533

iBAQ divided by the total iBAQ of all identified proteins within a sample. The FOT values were

534

multiplied by 105 for the ease of presentation and missing values were imputed with 10-5.

537

The plasma samples used for NMR analysis were first treated with 56oC for 30 min. Our

538

subsequent quantitative measurements of samples from healthy controls showed that such

539

treatments caused no differences to the quantification results.

540

NMR analysis was conducted on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) as

541

reported previously (Jimenez et al., 2018) with some minor modifications. In brief, 320μL of

542

each plasma sample was mixed with 320μL of a phosphate buffer (0.085 M containing 10%

543

D2O) with composition described previously (Jiang et al., 2012), and 600μL mixture was

544

transferred into a 5mm NMR tube for NMR analysis. 152 parameters of the plasma were then

545

quantified using a server-based software package (Bruker Biospin), including 112 parameters

546

for lipoproteins (including main fractions, subclasses and compositional components therein),

547

two acute-phase glycoproteins together with 41 small metabolites (such as amino acids,

548

ketone bodies, glucose, carboxylic acids, ethanol). We also quantified six ratio-parameters for

549

saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids from the

550

diffusion-edited spectra (Xu et al., 2012). We further calculated 187 more ratio-parameters

551

(such as the cholesterol-to-triglyceride ratio, percentage of triglycerides and cholesterol in

552

total lipids) from the quantitative data for lipoproteins. A total of 348 quantitative parameters

553

obtained were collectively employed to define the metabolomic phenotypes of each of the

554

human plasma samples.

557

Four data sets representing the (i) clinical tests, (ii) exRNA-seq, (iii) mRNA-seq, and (iv)

558

proteomics quantification analysis were used to develop prognostic models for the prediction

559

of patient outcomes (i.e. good or poor). Patients with a “good” outcome included those with

560

mild or severe syndrome but who were discharged after treatment; while patients with “poor”

561

outcomes included those who died or remained in ICU for more than two months.

562

Prognostic models were developed and validated using a two-layer validation strategy

563

(Fig. S5A) to prevent information leaking from the training set to the validation set13. Briefly,

564

patients were first divided into training and validation sets with equal size based on outcome

565

and admission date. The training set was then used to select variables and train prognostic

566

models using multiple machine learning algorithms, including nearest mean classification

567

(NMC), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)

568

through an internal-layer of 50 runs of five-fold cross-validation process to resist overfitting.

569

Next, a final model was built using the whole training set with the best performing machine

570

learning algorithm as defined above. The final model was further validated using the

571

validation set as an external-layer evaluation. Model performance was assessed in terms of

572

the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive

573

predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).

574

Prognostic biomarkers were identified based on the frequency of variables selected by

575

machine learning algorithms. Because the sample size was relatively small compared to the

576

large number of variables, it was difficult to identify stable biomarkers as indicated by the low

577

frequencies of the variables used in the prognostic models13 (Figs. S5A and S5B). To detect

578

more robust prognostic biomarkers, 50 runs of five-fold cross-validation process were

579

therefore applied to the whole data set. The variables used by the best performing machine

580

learning algorithm were identified as prognostic biomarkers for each data set.

581

Learning curve model comparison

582

Learning curve model comparison (LCMC) was performed using Predictive Modeling Review

583

as available in JMP Genomics 10

584

(https://www.jmp.com/en_us/software/genomics-data-analysis-software.html). LCMC reveals

585

the effects of sample size on the accuracy and variability of the predictive models using 10

586

runs of 4-fold cross-validation.

587

We performed LCMC with prognosis (good or poor) as target variables, and the clinical

588

variables, exRNA, mRNA, or proteomics measurements as predictors. Fig. S5C shows each

589

individual (RMSE) and (AUC) learning curve and the average for each of the eight partition

590

tree models for clinical endpoints, as well as exRNA using K-fold cross validation. The LCMC

591

suggested that with up to 15 samples, eight partition tree models reached AUC as 1 for

592

clinical variables. However, more than 23 and 30 samples were needed for one and three

593

models, respectively, to reach AUC of 1 for exRNA-seq data. The variability of RMSE and

594

AUC for the proteomic and mRNA-seq data (not shown) were between that observed for

595

clinical variables and the exRNA data.

were used for the comparison of categorical variables. p-values were adjusted using

600

Bonferroni correction or the Benjamini and Hochbery False Discovery Rate (FDR) in multiple

601

comparisons, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Principal components

602

analysis (PCA) was conducted with univariance scaling, with the scores plot showing a

603

distribution of metabolomic phenotypes for healthy participants and patients with moderate or

604

severe COVID-19 (and upon discharge). Correlations were tested using Pearson correlation

605

coefficients. Locally Weighted Linear Regression (Loess) was used for visualizing the time

606

series data. All analyses were performed using appropriate R packages (version 3.5.1).
