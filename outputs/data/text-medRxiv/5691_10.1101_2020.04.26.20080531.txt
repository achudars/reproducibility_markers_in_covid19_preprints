ABSTRACT
Background
In response to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, governments have adopted a variety of public health
measures. There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea,
Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not
performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate
due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this
study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate.
Methods
We use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that
exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the
case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous
department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate
between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the
existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality.

The increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001
percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would
have remained alive.
Conclusion
Massive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways. Mass
testing may help decision-makers to implement healthcare measures to limit the spread of the
disease.

Introduction
Since it was reported in late December 2019 from Hubei province in China, the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has now spread worldwide with more than 2
million confirmed cases by the end of April 2020.1 The outbreak reached Europe via Italy at the
end of February and quickly affected the entire continent, making Europe the epicenter by midMarch. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV2 to be a pandemic in
mid-March 2020. While research is still underway to find a curative treatment, the increasing
number of severe cases admitted to hospital has raised fears of overburdening the health care
systems.
To prevent such a situation, governments have implemented various public health measures such
as mobility restrictions, social distancing, or mass screening strategies. On March 16th, the head
of the WHO pronounced in favor of massive population tests, because “you cannot fight a fire
blindfolded”.2 Yet, there is a growing debate about the impact of mass testing on mortality rates.3
We have observed strong differences in testing rates between countries; for example, South-Korea,
Germany, or Iceland, have undertaken important screening policies and now report low casefatality rates. On the contrary, countries like Spain or France have restricted access to diagnostic
tests for inpatients or health care workers and now report higher mortality rates.4 Unfortunately,
cross-country comparisons are difficult due to the strong heterogeneity among countries. Even in
the United States of America, endowments for medical centers and lockdown strategies are very
different from one state to another.
By contrast, France kept a relatively centralized health system but as the epidemic was expanding,
the Health Regional Agencies (ARS) were given autonomy in terms of screening strategies
implementation; however, at the same time, a strict lockdown approach was instituted for all
regions.5,6 Among French regions, the main difference in their strategies was the intensity of
testing policies. Screening policies and mortality rate might be related to the fact that testing allows
authorities to detect and isolate infected people and to prevent them from transmitting the virus;
and also enables early treatment, thus increasing the chances of cure.7
We propose a novel approach to assess the impact of focused screening strategies on mortality
rates, which exploits policy discontinuities at region borders and contiguous department pairs that
are located on opposite sides of a region border. This methodology has been used in an economic
setting to evaluate the effects of the minimum wage on earnings and employment in the US.8

Materials and methods
Data sources and procedures
We conducted a retrospective study, with a prospective database, including the total of patients
who were admitted to hospital and afterwards discharged, the total of casualties and the total of
tests performed for screening COVID-19 infection (RT-PCR) by out-of-hospital medical
laboratories. The sample covers the period from 19/03/2020 to 17/04/2020, which corresponds to
a lockdown period in France. All the information was provided daily by the French Public Health
Agency (Santé Publique France; https://www.data.gouv.fr/). The data was gathered from different
geographic areas within France and no other countries were included. We merged this dataset with

information on hospital occupancy rates for intensive care units published by the French Ministry
of Health (https://www.sae-diffusion.sante.gouv.fr/). Sociodemographic data were extracted from
the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (https://statistiques-locales.insee.fr/). Our
analysis took place at the department level.
Fixed-effects model: Empirical strategy
In our study, we exploit the fact that from 14/03/2020, the French government has activated the
third stage of the national plan for the prevention and the control of the epidemic, which translates
into non-systematic testing of symptomatic individuals. From this date, testing policies were
determined at the region level by the Regional Public Health Agencies. We used a fixed-effects
model to assess the impact of the number of tests performed over time at a local geographical level
(department) on fatality-cases. In fixed-effects models, subjects serve as their own controls,
providing a means for controlling omitted-variable bias. Otherwise stated, fixed-effects models
allow controlling for time-invariant heterogeneity, i.e. all possible characteristics that do not
change over time.9
We used two distinct samples: i) The all-department sample (AD sample) that includes 94
departments distributed across 12 regions; ii) The contiguous border department-pair sample
(CBDP sample) that contains all the contiguous department pairs that straddle a region boundary.
Metropolitan France counts 96 departments. We excluded two departments, Haute-Corse and
Corse-du-Sud, that are part of a region, Corsica, that does not share any direct border with others.
Among the 94 departments, 69 lie along a region border. As each department may belong to several
department-pairs, we have a total of 237 distinct department-pairs. Our strategy consisted in
comparing all contiguous department pairs sharing a region border (See Figure 1 for an example)
to identify the effect of testing on the case fatality rate. Tests rate and death rates were calculated
using the number of RT-PCR tests and the number of deaths related to COVID-19 divided by the
number of patients admitted to the hospital, respectively.
Fixed-effects model: Estimation strategy
Specifications using the all department sample (AD Sample)
We first estimate the effect of testing on case-fatality rate using the canonical fixed-effects model
and the AD sample (Specification (1)):
𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝜙𝑖 + 𝑢𝑖𝑡
where 𝑖 denote the department, 𝑡 the time, 𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑖𝑡 is the case fatality rate in department 𝑖 at time 𝑡,
𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑇𝑖𝑡 represents the percentage of people hospitalized that are tested in department 𝑖 at time 𝑡,
𝜙𝑖 is a department fixed effect, and 𝑢𝑖𝑡 an error term.
Specifications using the contiguous border department-pair sample (CBDP Sample)
We now turn to our preferred identification strategy, which exploits policy discontinuities at region
borders. To achieve identification, we estimate the following model using the CBDP sample
(Specification (4)):
𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑖𝑝𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑇𝑖𝑡 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜈𝑝 + 𝜖𝑖𝑝𝑡

where 𝑖 denote the department, 𝑝 the department-pair, 𝑡 the time, 𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑖𝑝𝑡 is the case fatality rate
in department 𝑖 in department-pair 𝑝 at date 𝑡, 𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑇𝑖𝑡 represents the percentage of people
hospitalized that are tested in department 𝑖 in department-pair 𝑝 at date 𝑡, 𝜇𝑖 represents a
department fixed effect and 𝜈𝑝𝑡 a department-pair fixed effect. Standard errors are clustered on the
region and border segment separately to account for possible correlation in the residuals.8

Results
Study Sample
Although fixed-effects models control for all characteristics which do not change over time, we
report some time-invariant variables in Table S1 for information. The average number of tested
individuals was 613.43 per department with a share of positive cases of approximatively 25
percent. We count a total of 40762 hospitalizations. The observed share of the population above
age 65 was roughly 21 percent. As shown by Figure 2, the number of deaths increased quickly,
from 154 on March 19th to 11532 on April 17th. Over the same period, the number of tests increased
from 1713 to 133108.
The path of mortality and testing was not homogenous over the territory. The autonomy given to
Regional Public Heaths Agencies generated unprecedented differences in testing rate across
regions and strong discontinuities at region borders (See Figure 3).
The department fixed effect captures time-invariant heterogeneity across departments. This
includes sociodemographic variables (such as the structure of age, race, or gender in the
population), but also many variables related to health facilities (number of hospitals, medical
density or medical devices). We add time-varying confounding factors in specifications (b) and
(c). Specification (b) includes the occupancy rate of the resuscitation units, while specification (c)
also controls for the rate of positive tests. The first variable controls for the capacity of hospitals
to treat patients at different stages of the COVID-19 epidemic while the second controls for
selection bias. Table 1 reports the estimates provided by specifications (a)-(c). Our baseline
estimates reveal that a 1 percentage point (pp) increase in the tests/hospitalizations ratio leads to a
statistically significant decrease in the case mortality rate by slightly less than 0.001pp.
Finally, table 2 displays the results for specification (d)-(f). Our estimates reveal that a 1 pp
increase in the tests/hospitalizations ratio leads to a statistically significant drop of case mortality
rate by 0.001 pp. Putting these numbers into perspective involves that for each additional 1000
tests, one person would have remained alive.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is one of the major public health emergencies of international concern for
decades. Countries have implemented various measures mostly based on mobility restriction,
social distancing, and regional or national lockdown. All of these public health measures are aimed
at "flattening the curve" of the infected cases to limit avoidable mortality due to overburdened
health care systems. We evaluate the effect of mass screening COVID-19 on mortality rate in
France during the first month of the lockdown. We take advantage of the difference in screening

intensity among French regions. We first estimate the effect of testing on case-fatality rate using
the canonical fixed-effects model and the AD sample and find that the increase of screening rate
of 1 pp allows mortality rate to decrease of nearly 0.001 pp. We confirmed our results by estimating
the fixed-effects model using the CBDP sample which compares contiguous French departments
sharing region borders.
To the best of our knowledge, no large randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been implemented
to investigate the effect of tests on the case-fatality rate, probably due to time, budget, or ethical
constraints. When RCT are difficult to implement or unethical, natural experiments (NE) are one
of the best alternatives. The principle of NE is to mimic the existence of treatment and control
groups using an instrumental variable that induces a change in the explanatory variable but has
any direct effect on the outcome. However, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemics, finding a
suitable instrument remains a hard task. In the absence of RCT or NE, many researchers try to
approximate using standard methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, or propensity
scores. However, such methods are subject to the well-known omitted-variable bias, leading to
severe bias in estimating the effects of the variables that are included. Consequently, causal
inference via statistical adjustment represents a poor alternative to randomized experiments. In
such a context, panel data models represent the best way to control for heterogeneity and to
improve causal estimation.8 We use a fixed-effects model because it represents a powerful tool for
longitudinal data analysis.9 However, such a model requires substantial differences between
treatment intensities across entities and time to get precise estimates. Our data meets these
conditions: i) no region has the same test rate path than other regions over the period considered;
ii) the test rate varies greatly across regions and time. Methods based on regional controls and
policy discontinuities have several advantages: i) contiguous border departments are relatively
similar, in particular with regard to health trends, which are of major importance in the context of
an epidemic; ii) the testing policy is determined at the region level and is largely exogenous from
the point of view of a department, which rules out potential reverse causality.8
Until a vaccine is developed, the only way to prevent an unrestrained scenario is to control the
spread of SARS-CoV-2. This is a challenging task because some asymptomatic infected patients
could potentially spread the virus. Literature reports an alarming proportion of asymptomatic
infected cases. Epidemiological data from the Diamond Princess cruise sheep revealed only 18%
of positive cases reported no symptoms.10 Two hospitals in New York implemented universal
testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs in women who were admitted for delivery,
and revealed that nearly 90% of patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission reported
no symptoms.11 Overall population screening in Iceland revealed that only 57% of participants
with positive tests reported symptoms of Covid-19.12 This proportion could be even higher,
because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2.13 Testing is part of a strategy to
limit the transmission of the virus and WHO recommends a rapid diagnosis and isolation of cases
in combination with a rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. Several
authors support the implementation of mass screening policies.3,14 In our opinion, mass screening
may positively impact the fatality case rate in different ways. First, unfocused testing, i.e. not
limited to symptomatic subjects, could improve the monitoring of the progress of the epidemic and
facilitate decision-making by the health authorities. The use of "case definition", given the limited
knowledge of the new disease, probably resulted in a low sensitivity to detect infected subjects,
resulting in a delayed perception of the progression of the epidemic.15,16 Screening strategies are
subject to the availability of tests which indirectly shapes epidemic curves.17 While the USA

increased their screening capacities between late-February to early-March, the country
experienced a rapid increase of total infected cases.18 Second, mass screening may also allow early
identification of infected subjects and rapid implementation of isolation measures. Early reports
from Wuhan suggest that public health interventions combining universal symptoms survey, traffic
restriction and home quarantine resulted were temporarily associated with an increased control of
the outbreak.19,20 A modeling from Singapore suggests that quarantining of infected individuals
and their family members, school closure and workplace distancing could reduce the progression
of the epidemic but is associated to a significant economic cost.21 Review from the Cochrane
database concludes that quarantine is important in reducing the number of covid-19 cases but is
dependent on screening strategies.22 Also, a US survey on the impact of school closure on mortality
reports that the transmission prevention by school closure needs to be weighted with the potential
loss of health-care workers.23 This supports that public health decisions should be as focused as
possible in order to limit the negative impact on the economy and the society.24 Importance of
rapid diagnosis and case identification and isolation will become of utmost importance with the
end of lockdowns.
Our study far supports a significant impact of screening strategies on the case-fatality rate in
France. Notwithstanding, there are some limitations to our results. First, they belong to France and
it would be very hazardous to pretend that they apply to other countries because their exposition
to COVID-19 is different, they adopted different strategies, and have different health structures.
Second, to provide further evidence on this relation, it would be worth applying this methodology
to other countries for which such data are available and in which testing policies are sufficiently
heterogeneous across geographical areas.
In addition, the data on tests collected by the French Public Health Agency are those made by
private laboratories and do not include those made in public hospitals. This represents an important
share of tests (between half and two thirds) and we cannot rule out the possibility that this
unobservable amount of screening activity may affect our results. Lastly, our study cannot quantify
the respective contribution of the treatment delivered to screened and infected individuals or the
lower dissemination of the virus that results from quarantining policies.

Conclusion
COVID-19 intensive screening policies were significantly associated with a decrease in the
fatality-case rate in France. These results support the implementation of mass screening strategies
and could provide important information for decision-makers in the fight against SARS-CoV2
pandemic. The optimal testing strategy might also concern economic issues. Indeed, the Bank of
France estimated that each fortnight of lockdown costs to France 1.5% of annual GDP (nearly
USD48 billions).25,26 From a costs/benefits perspective one might naturally wonder what is the
optimal policy capable of containing the outbreak and lowering the fatality rate. This is in our
research agenda.

Figure 3: Tests rate and death rates across Region in France.

Test rate: number of RT-PCR tests divided by the number of patients admitted to the hospital for
COVID-19. Death rate: number of deaths in hospital due to COVID-19 divided by the number of
patients admitted to the hospital. We use shapefiles for regions and departement to construct the
maps and compute the contiguity matrix (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/contours-desregions-francaises-sur-openstreetmap/; https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/contours-desdepartements-francais-issus-d-openstreetmap/ ). Reading: PACA belongs to the top 20% of
regions that test more and to the bottom 20% of regions that have the lowest fatality ratio.
