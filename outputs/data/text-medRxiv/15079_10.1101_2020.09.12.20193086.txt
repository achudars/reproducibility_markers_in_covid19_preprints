Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly stopped the steady life and enhanced environmental
quality. To apprehend the transmission of COVID-19 and the improvement of air quality, we have
studied air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, and NO2), CO2 emission, and climate variables
(temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) in the extremely polluted and densely
populated Southeast Asian megacity Dhaka, Bangladesh from March to June 2020. The Kendall and
Spearman correlations were chosen to test the connotation of air quality and climate variables with
COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 were 65.0
± 37.9 and 87.1 ± 52.8 µm m-3, and 427 ± 11.8 ppm, respectively. The average PM2.5 and PM10
drastically reduced up to 62% during COVID-19 lockdown in Dhaka comparing with March 2020
(before lockdown). Comparing with the same period in 2019, PM2.5 reduced up to 33.5%. The
average NO2 concentration was 35.0 µmol m-2 during the lockdown period in April, whereas 175.0
µmol m-2 during March (before lockdown). A significant correlation was observed between
COVID-19 cases and air quality indicators. A strong correlation was obtained between climate
variables and the total number of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality representing a favorable
condition for spreading the virus. Our study will be very expedient for policymakers to establish a
mechanism for air pollution mitigation based on scientific substantiation, and also will be an
essential reference for the advance research to improve urban air quality and the transmission of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus in the tropical nations.

Keywords: COVID-19; air quality indicators; PM2.5 and PM10 ; climate variables; Kendall and

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has been progressing in 213 countries and territories all over the world
(Hopkins, 2020). It has been a devastating attack in China, Italy, France, Spain, United States,
Brazil, and many other countries (Hopkins, 2020; WHO, 2020b). In December 2019, COVID-19
started as an epidemic event in Wuhan, China having 11 million inhabitants in the central Hubei
Province. People were suffering from pneumonia as the result of infection of this novel coronavirus
(Li et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020a). This virus was termed as SARS-CoV-2 on January 7, 2020, for
its similarity with global epidemic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that occurred
between 2002 and 2003. The severe respiratory complications are causing caused the epidemic and
officially termed as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020 (Xu et al., 2020, WHO, 2020a). SARS-CoV2 contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA and which has a size of approximately 120 nm in
diameter spreading through droplets transmission (Shereen et al., 2020). The most severe symptoms
were generally observed in older individuals having previous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular,
endocrine, digestive, and respiratory diseases (Sohrabi et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a). Up to June
16, 2020, over 443,281 have lost their lives due to COVID-19 infection in the entire world out of
8,196,036 infections on average of 5.41 % mortality rate (https://www.worldometers.info). The
virus has transmitted worldwide but, nowadays, some countries are recovering from the new
transmission. However, in some regions of the world, particularly Southeast Asian countries (e.g.,
Bangladesh, India), the COVID-19 infection scenario is worsening day by day. Poor standard of
living, limited health care facilities, high population density, worst air quality, and climatevulnerable situation make the people of this region more endangered towards infection.

In Bangladesh, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported on March 8, 2020, and the first death of
COVID-19 patient on March 18, 2020, by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and
Research (IEDCR) (https://iedcr.gov.bd/). As of June 16, 2020, Bangladesh has seen a total
COVID-19 infection of 94,481; total recovered of 36,262 and total death of 1,262 (mortality rate
was 1.3% based on confirmed cases). The greater Dhaka region has become the epicenter of
COVID-19 new cases and deaths in Bangladesh (https://iedcr.gov.bd/). The lockdown was enforced
on 26th March 2020, which ended on 30th May 2020. This long-term lockdown affected industrial
production, educational institutes, construction activities, small and large scale businesses. It created
a huge negative impact on the economy and a large group of people is facing a crisis for their daily
livings. Due to the uncontrolled situation of COVID-19, the Government of Bangladesh again
instigated regional lockdown depending on the number of infected people on June 16, 2020, marked
as a red, yellow, and green zone. During the lockdown, nature has got an opportunity for healing as
dwellers are maintaining social distancing, quarantine at home, minimum outside activities.
Therefore, we saw the blue sky in Dhaka city during the lockdown period (more than 100 days). Air
quality has also substantially improved compared to the previous years in Dhaka like other cities in
the World, e.g., Delhi, (-60%), Seoul (-54%), Wuhan (-44%), and Los Angeles (-31%) (IQAir,
2020).
However, air quality was not improved significantly in the entire world. It has improved a lot in
some cities but other cities it did not change at all, and the cause was not the COVID-19 lockdown
only (Schiermeier, 2020). For example, a significant reduction in Los Angles, USA was not clear,
either for COVID-19 precautions or falling rain during this period (Schiermeier, 2020). In the
absence of traffic vehicles and control industrial activities, several air pollutants in China declined

up to 90% during COVID-19 pandemic (Le et al., 2020) (a reduction of 22.8 μg m-3 NO2 and 18.9
μg m-3 PM2.5 were also observed in China - Chen et al., 2020b). Although it has not untarnished the
role of aerosol particles in the transmission of the SAR-CoV-2 virus, long-term high-level exposure
to air pollutants may have protracted vulnerability and mortality rates of COVID-19, (Liu et al.,
2020).
Some studies reported the relationship between the number of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases
and climate variables, e.g., temperatures, humidity (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020; Ma et al., 2020).
Bukhari and cols, 2020 reported that the low number of positive COVID-19 confirmed cases
observed in tropical countries might be explained due to their usual warm and humid environmental
conditions. The regions with high relative humidity above 10 g m-3 could see a slowdown of
COVID-19 transmissions in a short time (Bukhari and Jameel, 2020). Ma and cols, 2020 also
revealed that the temperature and humidity were affecting factors related to the number of COVID19 mortality in Wuhan, China (Ma et al., 2020).
Therefore, we would like to quantify the effect of lockdown on air quality parameters (PM10, PM2.5,
NO2, and CO2) and also would like to elucidate the correlation between climate variables
(temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) and air quality indicators with COVID19 morbidity and mortality in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Research Methodology
Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh and the center of the Government, trade, and culture of the
country. Geographically, Dhaka is located in the center of Bangladesh between 23˚22’30’’ N to
24˚22’20” N and 89˚41’6’’ E to 90˚59’23” E, on the eastern banks of the Buriganga River (Fig. 1).

The climate of Bangladesh is generally hot and humid. Meteorologically, Bangladesh can be subdivided into four seasons. Pre-monsoon (March-May), Monsoon (June-August), Post-monsoon
(September-November), and winter (December- January) (Salam et al., 2012; Salam et al., 2003).
The maximum summer temperature ranges from 30º C to 40º C. April is the warmest month and,
January is the coldest month in general. The temperature drops to 10º C on average across the
country during winter. The effect of monsoon climate is heavy rainfall. The maximum precipitation
is 103.6 inches, the minimum is 46.1 inches while the average is 63.4 inches. Dhaka is the most

densely populated megacity in the World with 21 million people residing within 1462.6 square
kilometers. The wind direction follows the general trend of south and south-west in the premonsoon and north and north-west in the winter (Salam et al., 2003).
This study includes two stages of analysis: 1) to assess the effect of lockdown on air quality
indicators (PM2.5 and PM10), CO2 emission, and 2) to study the correlation of climate variables
(average temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) and air quality parameters with
COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were utilized
to examine the correlation between variables and air quality parameters. Air quality data of Dhaka
was obtained from our measurements at the Mukarram Hussain Khundker Building, University of
Dhaka. Data set for COVID-19 was taken from the COVID-19 archive from the Directorate General
of Health Services (DGHS) (www.dghs.gov.bd). Data on climate variables (average, relative
humidity, wind speed, and rainfall) was taken from weatherforyou.com and darksky.net.

Results and Discussion
Overview of the Air Quality and Climate variables
The summary of PM2.5, PM10, CO2, temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and rainfall
between March 8 (1st day of confirmed COVID-9 cases in Bangladesh) and June 16, 2020, in
Dhaka megacity has been given in Table 1. The total average PM2.5 and PM10 were 65.0 ± 37.9 and
87.1 ± 52.8 µg m-3, which were about 2.6 and 1.7 times higher than WHO guideline values for 24 h
average, respectively. The average PM2.5 was 50.8±19.6 µg m-3 during the lockdown and 94.9 ±
30.6 µg m-3 before lockdown in Dhaka megacity. The lowest average relative humidity was 39.1 %,
the highest was 99.8 %, and the average rainfall was 0.23 ± 0.31 inch hour-1. The average CO2

As control measures during COVID-19 pandemic, precautions, such as lockdown were enforced by
restricting vehicle movements, closing government offices, schools, colleges, universities, shopping
malls, and “stay in home order” on March 26, 2020, have been taken by the Government of
Bangladesh. Due to the restrictions, the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 have reduced drastically
up to 62% during April. The times series of daily average concentrations of PM 2.5, PM10, and CO2
have given in Figs. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) mentioning the events, e.g., lockdown begins, Garments
industry open, Eid festival, lockdown ends and offices, etc. The daily average global CO2 were also
drastically reduced up to 17% with a maximum of 26% and a minimum of 4% in the early April
compared to the previous year in 2019 due to the restricted activates during COVID-19 pandemic

(Le Quéré et al., 2020). In general, the values of the air quality parameters were getting lower with
the progress of the lockdown (Fig. 2). When the lockdown was curbed on May 30, 2020, we can
see, the concentrations of the air quality parameters were rising slowly in Dhaka.

from April to June (Fig. 2(d)), especially for PM 2.5, PM10, and CO2), but NO2 reduction in April
2020 is only for traffic emission (Fig. 5). However, we have identified and quantified the
contribution of reduction in air quality indicators due to COVID-19 lockdown by comparing it with
the same period of the previous year 2019 (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). As a case study, we have
differentiated between “before lockdown” and “during lockdown” PM2.5 emission in Fig. 3.

Several recent papers reported that a decline in PM2.5 is associated with lockdown and affected
COVID-19 transmission (Chauhan and Singh, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). The data of the PM2.5
concentrations were analyzed at five different locations in Dhaka city before lockdown (March 16-

made a comparison with the same period in 2019 (Fig. 3). The average PM 2.5 decline during the
lockdown period was 42.3% in Uttara, 31.6% in Mirpur, 57.4% at Nurbag, Kamrangirchar, 28.8%
in Mohammadpur, 56.5% in Baridhara, 62% in Dhaka University area (Fig. 3). The overall average
PM2.5 decreased by about 46.6% during the lockdown period. The average PM 2.5 value during the
lockdown period in 2020 also decreased by 33.5% compared to the last year (2019), but regular
period values of PM2.5 were almost similar between 2020 and 2019 (Fig. 3).
The satellite images of NO2 distribution over the Dhaka city have been given in Fig. 4 at different
periods before and during the lockdown, and also during limited scale lockdown in 2020; and also,
for a similar period in 2019. It has clearly shown the significant reduction of NO2 concentration
during the lockdown period in April 2020 (about 35 µmol m-2), whereas it was about 170 µmol m-2
before lockdown over Dhaka.
The comparison between April 13-27 in 2020 and April 15-29 in 2019 was also indicating a very
drastic reduction of NO2 concentration over Dhaka. During April 2020, the vehicles were very
limited in the street of Dhaka due to the complete shutdown of offices, schools, colleges,
universities, constructions, industries, and also “stay in-home” order. These are the major causes of
the drastic reduction of NO2 over Dhaka city because the foremost source of NO2 emissions is from
traffic vehicles. The NO2 reduction was 40% (on average) in many cities of China, 20 - 38% in
Western Europe and the USA during COVID-19 lockdown compared to the same period in 2019
(Bauwens et al., 2020).

Variation of COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality
With Air Quality Indicators
Temporal variation of total confirmed COVID-19 cases, new cases, and daily deaths with PM10,
PM2.5, and AQI in Dhaka has given in Fig. 5. The relationship between aerosol particle number and
mass with SARS-CoV-2 virus has been studying but not fully understood yet. The high
concentration of viral RNA has been observed when the submicron and/or super submicron
particles having peaked in the aerosol size distribution curve (Liu et al., 2020). The relationship
between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality cases and air quality index (PM10, PM2.5, and AQI)
was not linear (Fig. 5). The reason may be the particle sizes - PM2.5 and PM10 are much larger
compared to the size of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, long term exposure to a high
concentration of particulate air pollution might be attributed to bronchial asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), chronic heart diseases, which might be one of the causes
of the relatively high COVID-19 death rate in Dhaka.

With Climate variables
The variation of total COVID-19 confirmed cases, daily new cases, and total deaths with climate
variables (temperate and relative humidity) in Dhaka from March 8, 2020 to June 16, 2020 has
given in Fig. 6. The total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and total deaths were increasing
sharply in Dhaka. The temperature and relative humidity curve were also going up. The number of
confirmed cases was 94,481 on June 16, 2020 with the total deaths of 1262. However, the
relationship between climate variables and COVID-19 cases is not well understood yet, may be
many factors are responsible. But a strong linear relationship has been observed for the COVID-19

total and deaths cases with temperature and relative humidity in Dhaka city (Fig. 6). Climate
variables (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and rainfall) have a significant impact
on the formation, dispersion and deposition of pollutants in the atmosphere. Ambient air pollutants
with climate variables aggravated the pulmonary diseases and injured the respiratory pathways, and
hence facilitated the virus to infect the human system and cause unadorned damages (Zoran et al.,
2020).

rainfall) with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In both Kendall and Spearman correlation tests,
we found significant negative correlation with air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, CO2, and AQI)
with total confirmed COVID-19 cases, daily new cases, and mortality in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Table
2). The magnitude of the correlation coefficients of PM2.5, PM10, CO2, and AQI were lower in
Kendall tests than the Spearman correlation. The air quality was good during lockdown period but
the mortality and morbidity was high in Dhaka. Because the COVID-19 transmitted patients may be
experiencing worst air quality from the previous months (January, February and March) of the year
that have significant impact on their health. Patients organs (e.g., lung, heart, kidney, etc.) may
already compromised by the long term exposure of the poor air quality in Dhaka. Some other
factors (immune system, cofactors) may also be contributed to this significant negative correlation
in Dhaka. In California, USA, Bashir et al. (2020b) also found similar results - PM2.5, PM10, SO2,
CO, and NO2 have significant negative correlation with total COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
Whereas, the higher concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 reported a positive correlation with death
rate of COVID-19 in China (Yao et al., 2020). Fattorini and Regili, 2020 revealed that the primary
cause of COVID-19 in Northern Italy was the continuous exposure of high levels of PM 10 and PM2.5
(Fattorini and Regili, 2020). As a first-order approximation, the COVID-19 related morbidity and
mortality in Dhaka are significantly correlated with the high exposure of air quality parameters,
especially PM10 and PM2.5 like other cities in the World (e.g., California, Wuhan, and Northern
Italy). The climate variables (average temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, and rainfall)
have strong positive correlation with the total COVID-19 confirmed and daily new cases, and
mortality in Dhaka.

Previous studies of Vandini et al., (2013) and Bashir et al., (2020a) reported similar results and
support our findings. Shi et al., 2020 reported that climate indicator (temperature) serves as a driver
for the COVID-19. On the other hand, Méndez-Arriaga, (2020) reported a negative association of
the air temperature with the total confirmed COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 outbreak at Wuhan,

China showed a strong association between diseases spread and weather conditions, with a
prediction of “warm weather will play an important role in suppressing the virus.”

However, temperature and relative humidity may play a significant role in COVID-19 transmission
and also have a substantial role in the mortality rate (Auler et al., 2020; Poole, 2020; Sajadi et al.,
2020; Chen et al., 2020a; Ma et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b). Other meteorological indicators
such as wind velocity and rainfall also showed a significant positive correlation with COVID-19
cases in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Dhaka, as an administrative, cultural, and economic center of Bangladesh, experiences a high influx
of population from all over the country for seeking employment, education, business, and medical
treatments. Moreover, many people are living not only in the slums but also in the inappropriate
substandard houses with inadequate facilities and very limited medical access with the worst air
quality. All these made the COVID-19 situation in Dhaka uncontrollable and hence withstand with
a large number of COVID-19 confirmed and death cases for a comparatively long period.
Therefore, our study will supplement new knowledge for decision-makers that air quality and
climate variables are two important constraints that need to be addressed for controlling the
transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the developing countries.

Conclusion
Air quality parameters (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, NO2, and CO2) and climate variables (average
temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind velocity) were studied before and during the
COVID-19 pandemic from March 8, 2020, to June 16, 2020, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study
revealed the impact of COVID-19 precautions on Dhaka air quality. The Kendall and Spearman
correlation tests were performed to see the correlation between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality
cases with climate variables and air quality indicators. The air quality has drastically reduced in

Dhaka due to COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020 (on average, about 2.5 times lower PM2.5 and 6
times lower NO2 observed than a normal period). PM2.5, PM10, CO2, air quality index (AQI) has no
positive but a significant correlation (within 1.0%) with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases
and mortality. Average temperature, minimum temperature, and wind velocity have a strong
positive correlation with COVID-19 confirmed morbidity and mortality cases in Dhaka. These
findings will be helpful for policymakers to understand the mitigation mechanism of the air quality
and also will be useful for future research to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as air quality.
