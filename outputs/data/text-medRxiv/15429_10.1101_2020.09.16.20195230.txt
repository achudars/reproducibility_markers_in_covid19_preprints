ABSTRACT: Mechanical ventilators are essential to patients who become critically ill from

34

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shortages have been reported due to the novel

35

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We utilized cost-effective, on-

36

demand 3D printing (3DP) technology to produce critical components for a novel ventilator

37

multiplexer system, Vent-Lock, to split one ventilator or anesthesia gas machine between two

38

patients. FloRest, a novel 3DP flow restrictor, provides clinicians control of tidal volumes and

39

positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), using the 3DP manometer adaptor to monitor pressures.

40

We tested the ventilator splitter circuit in simulation centers between artificial lungs and used an

41

anesthesia gas machine to successfully ventilate two swines. As one of the first studies to

42

demonstrate splitting one anesthesia gas machine between two swines, we present proof-of-

43

concept of a de novo, closed, multiplexing system, with flow restriction for individualized patient

44

therapy. Our studies underscore that while possible, ventilator multiplexing is a complicated

45

synergy between machine settings, circuit modification, and patient monitoring. Consequently,

46

ventilator multiplexing is reserved only as a last emergency resource, by trained clinicians and

47

respiratory therapists with ventilator operative experience.

INTRODUCTION
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a

56

global pandemic resulting in rapid depletion of resources necessary to care for critically ill

57

patients, such as mechanical ventilators and their associated parts. Mechanical ventilators are

58

critical for the treatment of approximately 5-10% of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-

59

19) who become critically ill from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1. In the face of

60

the COVID-19 pandemic, it is estimated that there is a global ventilator shortage of 880,000 2.

61

This shortage may disproportionately affect developing countries who suffer from lack of

62

medical infrastructure and resources 3, historically resulting in higher mortality rates in

63

pandemics such as the Spanish Flu 4. For example, the continent of Africa has limited ventilator

64

capacity, with only 2,000 ventilators across 41 countries 5. This capacity deficit is further

65

worsened by the increased need due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

66

Ventilator shortages occur in resource-rich countries as well. Previous disasters and

67

current projections suggest that hospitals may be operating at 120-160% capacity in the face of a

68

pandemic or national disaster 6. Projections suggest that if 20% of the United States population is

69

infected with the virus, there will be significant deficiencies in intensive care unit beds and

70

mechanical ventilators 6,7. Furthermore, given the potential for a second wave of infection,

71

epidemiologists predict that if countries continue to lift restrictions used to slow the spread of the

72

virus too early, then a second global peak may result in a further shortage of medical supplies 8,

73

ventilators and ventilator associated parts. The Society of Critical Care Medicine shared that

74

clinicians continue to report ventilator shortages in summer of 2020, including 53% of 587

75

surveyed ICU clinicians did not have enough ventilators and had to use non-standard ventilators

76

or non-invasive devices, and a small percentage declined care due to shortage of ventilators, or

77

placed two patients on one ventilator9. Consequently, there is a critical need to address urgent

78

ventilator shortages in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

79

While the introduction of more ventilators, either de novo or commercial, could solve the

80

urgent medical needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, this solution represents a theoretical

81

ideal that cannot be achieved given the current monetary, time, hospital infrastructure, limited

82

scaling and production capacity, and supply chain constraints 10,11 , further exacerbated by lack

83

of standardization of parts across brands 12. An alternative strategy to quickly increase ventilator

84

capacity as an immediate step in urgent settings is to “split” or multiplex ventilators and

85

anesthesia gas machines. Ventilator multiplexing allows the usage of one machine to ventilate

86

multiple patients and effectively increases the clinical capacity to support urgent needs.

87

The concept of using one ventilator to support multiple patients during a disaster surge

88

was first published in 2006 by Neyman et al.13, who reported that four patients could be

89

supported for 12 hours using ventilator equipment and tubing. However, these in vitro studies

90

were restricted to patients with similar body habitus and lung compliances. Despite these study

91

limitations, it introduced ventilator multiplexing as a potential solution for emergency situations.

92

In 2017, this proof-of-concept was demonstrated in actual patients during the 2017 Las Vegas

93

shooting 14 when a physician supported multiple patients on a single ventilator as a temporary

94

emergency situation until more resources became available. The ability to multiplex ventilators

95

is valuable for global preparedness mechanisms to promptly increase ventilator capacity as an

96

immediate response for disasters, such as trauma surges, natural disasters, or in military

97

frontlines.

98
99

Emergency use of ventilator multiplexing is dependent on the dynamic lung states of the
patients, including associated lung compliances and airway resistances that drive airflow

100

balance. In the evolving pathologic state of COVID-19 patients with ARDS, an interdependent

101

ventilation system poses many safety concerns. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and other

102

societies in respiratory care issued a joint statement 15 summarizing main concerns with

103

ventilator multiplexing 16, including the inability to independently monitor and control

104

ventilation parameters (volumes, pressures, rates) critical for ARDS treatment, thus risking

105

adverse outcomes such as underventilation, or ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) such as

106

barotrauma. Additional concerns include ventilator alarm management, disrupted balance of

107

ventilation if a patient has spontaneous breathing, sudden deterioration, kink in the tubing, and

108

viral contamination if breathing circuits between patients are mixed, or the circuit becomes open.

109

While these barriers exist, they are not insurmountable for emergency ventilator

110

multiplexing. For example, recent engineering solutions have emerged using off-the-shelf

111

medical components that mitigate concerns in ventilator multiplexing by volume or pressure

112

control, and monitoring 17. It is optimistic that these circuits present potential solutions for

113

ventilator shortages in emergency situations; however, deployment can be limited due to

114

unstable supply chains that make these off-the-shelf medical components difficult to acquire 18,

115

even in developed countries up to six months from inciting events 19. Consequently, rapid

116

production of de novo ventilator multiplexing solutions are investigated to further address these

117

barriers.

118

Among multiple modalities for de novo manufacturing to address medical equipment

119

shortages, 3D printing has come to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic to address

120

critical shortages 12,20. 3D printing is a type of additive manufacturing that has emerged in the

121

past decades as a cost-effective, rapid on-demand production modality with broad applications

122

due to its ability to produce intricate and complex geometries from computer-aided designs

123

without tooling and expensive machines 21. 3D printing enables faster design and manufacturing

124

processes 22, so that it can be utilized in emergency situations to fill gaps in the supply chain 23.

125

Specifically, in reference to COVID-19, there have been multiple shortages in ventilator

126

associated equipment and valves, leading healthcare providers to look into different avenues of

127

manufacturing to address the gap in the supply 20. Ventilator splitter products which primarily

128

use commercial medical equipment may have limited or unreliable supply 17 in urgent situations.

129

We address urgent medical needs arising from unstable supply chains by using 3D printing to

130

rapidly and cost-effectively prototype and test components of our ventilator splitter circuit using

131

biocompatible and sterilizable materials.

132

In this study, we present Vent-Lock, a de novo, ventilator multiplexing system that

133

addresses major concerns with ventilator splitting, and is rapidly produced via 3D printing, thus

134

tapping into a broad international production infrastructure largely unaffected by the pandemic.

135

The Vent-Lock breathing circuit provides clinicians with a way to control, manage and monitor

136

patients split on one ventilator; circuit components allow for the change in individual tidal

137

volumes and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), pressure monitoring, and minimized back

138

flow and risk of contamination. Our novel, air-tight, 3DP flow restrictor (FloRest) is designed to

139

provide clinicians with precise control of tidal volumes. We validate the use of Vent-Lock

140

FloRest for both ventilators and anesthesia gas machines, successfully ventilating simulated

141

patients with mismatched lung compliances. Furthermore, we ventilated two swine safely with

142

Vent-Lock, demonstrating the device’s ability to both safely multiplex patients and to evolve

143

anesthesia gas machines (which are more commonly available in developing countries as

144

compared to ventilators) with increased ventilation settings. We share differences in multiplexing

145

of anesthesia gas machines and ventilators, and the impact of ventilator control mode (volume

146

control versus pressure control) on multiplexing, and additional challenges. The novel, de novo,

147

3DP Vent-Lock circuit and FloRest is well positioned to rapidly increase capacity of mechanical

148

ventilators to provisionally meet ventilator shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic and future

149

pandemics and disasters.

RESULTS

152

Vent-Lock 1+n(1) circuit and components

153

We validated a 1+n(1) system which can split one ventilator between one standard patient

154

and one or potentially more variable patients (Fig.1). The standard patient ideally has the lowest

155

lung compliance and has minimal components in the circuit to establish low resistance allowing

156

the ventilator to maintain standard function. The standard patient will be ventilated at pressure

157

settings unaltered from that delivered by the ventilator. Additional patients (n) added to the

158

circuit are considered variable patients and can have their tidal volumes and PEEP altered by

159

circuit components. This paper demonstrates use of a ventilator splitter adjusting for 1 control

160

and n=1 variable patients. The 1+n(1) split contains Vent-Lock 3DP parts and commercial parts

161

(Fig. 1). We 3D printed the splitters and the flow restrictors (needle valves). The other parts

162

including the one-way check valves, the filters and the PEEP valves were all commercial parts

163

(fig. S1). The Vent-Lock circuit was designed to be closed circuit and leak-free to minimize risk

164

of aerosolizing viral particles into the surrounding environment.

178

difficult to manage per patient and 4. Adjustment or discontinuation of ventilation to one patient

179

would alter breathing dynamics to other patients.

180

The goal of FloRest (Fig. 2A) was to allow the clinician to modify the flow rate of air

181

being delivered to the patient, thus providing ranges of clinical tidal volumes and PEEPs with

182

control sensitivity and a reliable linear relationship between closure and flow rate, tidal volume,

201

compliances demonstrates that Vent-Lock FloRest provides more control options than commercial ball valves and

202

gate valves, characterized by more available data points corresponding with different tidal volumes delivered.

203
204

considerations allowed for an air-tight and leak-proof design (fig. S2) and utilization of

205

biocompatible materials that can withstand extended exposure to warm humidified air and

206

sterilizing autoclave environment. Using a particle counter, post and pre-autoclave tests

207

demonstrate significant micron particle reduction after autoclaving (fig. S3).

208

The needle valve utilizes change in flow momentum, flow path geometry and orifice flow

209

design concepts allowing easy control of flow rate vs pressure drop ratio (i.e. flow coefficient)

210

compared to gate and ball valve concepts (more binary valve concepts). It operates with less total

211

pressure drop over the flow control ranges than typical globe valve concepts. The threading

212

allows for control over the flow rates and offers the clinician the ability to make fine adjustments

213

to the flow within the range of control. We used a gasket-inspired design featuring an O-ring

214

(E1000-212/AS568-212, O-Rings EPDM, FDA EPDM, Marco Rubber & Plastics, Seabrook,

215

New Hampshire, USA) seated between the needle and chamber to ensure airtightness, thus

216

reducing the risk of aerosolizing the virus into the surrounding environment. Final features of

217

FloRest (Fig. 2A) included sealing to the external environment using unthreaded upper needle

218

shafts for smoother interfaces between cap O-ring and needle during operation of valve and a

219

delayed start in needle threading to provide earlier range of flow control and to allow for safe

220

operation of valve by preventing full occlusion of flow to patient by clinician.

221

The FloRest has advantages compared with commercial valves in terms of the

222

controllability, biocompatibility, and sterilizability. The FloRest had similar range of control

223

compared to commercial gate valves (#P20034 PVC SCH 40 ½-in FNPT Ball Valve; G300 Lead

225

the Vent-Lock FloRest provides more control options than commercial valves, characterized by

226

more points available for the clinician to choose from corresponding to different tidal volumes

227

delivered. Furthermore, FloRest is produced with biocompatible, nontoxic materials that can be

228

safely sterilized, as compared to commercial ball valves with untested biocompatibility and

229

unknown sterilization protocols. Vent-Lock FloRest can be produced at an estimated $3.50 per

230

device in 3-hour 40 min print and process time via fused deposition modeling (FDM) (e3d,

231

BigBox3D Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Little Monster, Tevo 3D Electronic Technology Co. Ltd,

232

Zhanjiang, China) using PETG (PETG 3D Printer Filament, FilaMatrix, Virginia, USA). With

233

stereolithography (SLA; Form 2, Form 3, or Form 3B, Formlabs), it costs approximately $25,

234

and 16 hours production time with a 50 micron build layer height resolution, using surgical guide

235

resin (Surgical Guide, Formlabs). We demonstrate that the FloRest is leak proof through air

236

volume testing (fig. S2).

Vent-Lock 3DP Flow Restrictor (FloRest) control of tidal volumes and PEEP

239

We tested the use of Vent-Lock FloRest in the Johns Hopkins Medicine Simulation

Center (JHMSC) to confirm the following: 1) Allowing volumes to be distributed evenly

241

between patients, 2) variable patient control of PEEP, 3) variable patient tidal volume control

242

and 4) changes in the variable patient breathing settings does not alter breathing dynamics to the

243

standard patient.

244

We tested the Vent-Lock multiplexing system using a 1+1 split patient circuit (Fig. 1).

245

We used one ventilator (Puritan Bennett 840 Ventilator System, Avante Health Solutions) to

246

ventilate two patients with different lung compliances of 20 cmH2O and 50 cmH2O. We first

247

tested using a pressure control mode, with inspiratory pressures set at 25 cmH2O (additional

ventilator settings available in Table S2). The Vent-Lock FloRest allowed adjustment of tidal

249

volumes delivered to patients between 7- turns to 9- turns (fully closed), corresponding to

250

21.5% of tidal volume control range and 2-⅛ turning range control (Fig. 3A). It allowed control

251

of 85.7% of the total range of delivered tidal volumes (compared to initial variable patient tidal

252

volume) with negligible change in tidal volume delivery to the standard patient (range: 99.86%

253

and 103.2% initial standard patient tidal volume, mean: 102.1% ± 0.98%). We note that the total

254

expiratory volume reported by the ventilator trends with tidal volume delivered to the variable

255

patient (Fig. 3A) and the peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) of the variable patient and ventilator

256

peak inspiratory volumes also correspondingly decrease with decreases in tidal volume (Fig.

257

3B,C), while peak inspiratory volumes remain stable for the standard patient and peak end

258

expiratory volumes remain stable for both patients during these changes.

We repeated Vent-Lock 1+1 multiplexing patient circuit with the ventilator on volume

260

control mode to deliver a total of 2L of volume, corresponding to approximately 600 mL of tidal

261

volume per patient (additional ventilator settings available in table S1). We note that turning of

262

FloRest on the variable patient resulted in decrease of both tidal volumes and PIP (Fig. 4A,B).

263

However, this was accompanied with an increase in tidal volume delivery and PIP to the

264

standard patient (Fig. 4A,B), with relatively stable ventilator reported average pressures (Vent

265

Pavg) and PEEP (Fig. 4B). Thus, unlike in pressure control mode where control of delivery to the

266

variable patient was independent of the standard patient, flow restriction in the volume control

267

mode resulted in the modification of the ratio of tidal volumes delivered (Fig. 4C,

268

standard/variable patient tidal volume ratios).

Figure 4. Volume control mode: testing of Vent-Lock ventilator multiplexer with a ventilator or anesthesia

303

gas machine on volume control mode ventilating two simulated patients with different lung compliances. (A)

304

With the ventilator on volume control, decreases in variable patient tidal volumes result in increases in tidal volumes

305

delivered to the standard patient. This indicates that in volume control mode, patient ventilation circuits are

306

interdependent, and changes in one patient effects the other. (B) The ratios of the patient’s tidal volumes (standard

307

patient/variable patient) per closure of the Vent-Lock FloRest with ventilators on volume control. (C) On ventilator

308

volume control and with Vent-Lock FloRest closure, the changes in peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of the standard

309

patient and variable patient reflect that of tidal volume changes, while the ventilator reported PIP and Pavg increase,

310

and PEEP remains stable. (D)Vent-Lock FloRest was tested at Washington University in St. Louis using anesthesia

311

gas machines. The FloRest can be used to control delivered tidal volumes to the variable patient on both pressure

312

and volume control on anesthesia gas machines.

We replicated results using anesthesia gas machines (North American Drager Narkomed

315

2a, Ardus Medical; GE Aestiva 5 7900, Datex Ohmeda) at an alternate test site (Washington

316

University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The 1+1 circuit was tested with the Vent-

317

Lock FloRest on the variable patient. On both pressure control and volume control settings, the

318

Vent-Lock FloRest demonstrated control of tidal volume delivered to the variable patient with

319

stable tidal volumes delivered to the standard patient. Pressure control allowed slightly greater

320

range of control (Fig. 4D, reduction of 43.9% tidal volume at close, compared to 27.5%

321

reduction of tidal volume at close with volume control)

322

Real-time pressure reporting with Vent-Lock manometer adaptors

323

To facilitate continuous monitoring of pressures we designed a manometer adaptor that

324

allows clinicians to either spot-check pressures or continuously monitor with the use of standard,

325

disposable manometers such as those found on bag-valve-masks. The manometer adaptor can be

326

added in the circuit at any point and is designed to accurately reflect breathing pressures, such as

327

PIP and PEEP. We demonstrate that the manometer accurately reflects real-time pressures when

328

incorporated in the circuit (Fig. 5A). In a 1+1 circuit with the ventilator on pressure control, the

329

PEEP setting was incrementally increased, and associated ventilator detected PEEPs and Vent-

330

Lock manometer reported pressures were recorded. The Vent-Lock manometer reported

331

pressures were equivalent to the PEEPs (Figure 5B). We also conducted blind tests, where one

332

researcher set the PEEP on the ventilator and a second researcher (blinded to ventilator PEEP

333

settings) reported PEEP as reported by the Vent-Lock manometer. The second researcher

334

consistently and accurately reported all test values between 0 cmH2O to 50 cmH2O, in 5 cmH2O

335

increments, with total ten trials with no error.

Vent-Lock 3DP Flow Restrictor (FloRest) in Swine

356

Two domestic swine were anesthetized and ventilated using the Vent-Lock system with constant

357

volume delivery. Swine were successfully ventilated for approximately four hours using a single

358

ventilator. Initial calculated dynamic lung compliances were 50.3 and 48.1 ml/cm H2O for the

359

standard and variable swine, respectively. Throughout the experiment, minimum and maximum

360

dynamic compliance ranged from 50.3 to 244.5 and 37.9 to 87.1 ml/cm H2O for the standard and

361

variable swine, respectively, reflecting the differences in tidal volumes those swine received

362

during the flow restriction trial. Serial ABGs were monitored (Fig. 6) and initial shared ventilator

363

settings were determined to be too high as both swine developed a respiratory alkalosis. At

364

approximately two hours this was corrected and pH and paCO2 were allowed to normalize for

365

one hour. Vent settings were not changed following this equilibration. Over the next hour the

366

Vent-Lock system was adjusted from fully open to fully closed, where air was still allowed to

367

pass even when Vent-Lock is closed to prevent unintentional hypoventilation. Respiratory

368

characteristics including tidal volume ratios, percent of total set tidal volume delivered,

369

inspiratory pressure and tidal volume are presented in Fig. 7. While the tidal volume delivered to

370

the variable swine decreased marginally, a substantial increase in tidal volume was noted to the

371

standard swine (Fig. 7D), similar to what is seen in simulation center testing with ventilator on

372

volume control mode. Arterial blood gas measurements demonstrated hyperoxia in both swine

373

(Fig. 7C). A hypercarbic respiratory acidosis occurred in the variable swine (Figure 6A, B) as the

374

Vent-Lock closure reached its final turn. Necropsy performed to assess for gross lung pathology

375

showed no significant findings of all lung lobes.

DISCUSSION
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of ventilators in the treatment of

391

COVID-19 patients and the tenuous global supply of chain has resulted in the urgent need to

392

increase ventilator capacity. One such solution to lack of ventilators is the ability to use one

393

ventilator to support multiple patients. Previously reported challenges include inability to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195230; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

394

independently control flow and pressure to each patient, development of a closed system to

395

prevent viral contamination, and continuous monitoring.

396

We used 3D-printing to rapidly prototype components of a ventilator splitter circuit that

397

allows one ventilator or anesthesia gas machine to ventilate two patients. The circuit addresses

398

aforementioned challenges and allows the clinician to control individual patient’s pressures and

399

volumes, in a closed system with bacterial filters to reduce viral contamination. 3D printing was

400

selected as the prototyping and production modality due to rapid iterative production for research

401

and development and on-demand manufacturing to meet urgent needs in context of

402

biocompatible and sterilizable 3D printing materials. 3D printed components of the splitter

403

circuit were designed to include ventilator splitters, manometer adaptors for continuous pressure

404

monitoring and a flow restrictor to control tidal volumes and pressures.

405

The novel flow restrictor valve, Vent-Lock FloRest, is able to regulate tidal volumes to

406

one patient while maintaining flow to another patient (Fig. 3), and control PEEP when placed on

407

the expiratory limb with the manometer adaptor (Fig. 5). Design, research, and development was

408

driven by creating an airtight valve that allows precise control by the clinician. We demonstrated

409

that FloRest is compatible with multiple modes of ventilation strategies and anesthesia gas

410

machines (Fig. 4D). Vent-Lock FloRest has demonstrated volume and pressure control by

411

different physicians, using different mechanical ventilators or anesthesia gas machines, thus

412

demonstrating potential compatibility with different ventilators and anesthesia gas machines.

413

While the reproducibility of the Vent-Lock FloRest must be further investigated, this has

414

important global scalability implications as we demonstrate potential compatibility and

415

reproducibility not limited to make or type of ventilator or anesthesia gas machines, which may

416

be more commonly available in developing countries.

417

Our studies reveal fundamental differences in tidal volume patterns with flow restriction

418

with the ventilator in volume versus pressure mode. In pressure control, Vent-Lock FloRest

419

allowed for reduction in delivered tidal volumes to the variable patient with stable volumes

420

delivered to the standard patient (Fig. 3A). However, in volume control, reduction in delivered

421

tidal volume to the variable patient resulted in a concomitant increase in tidal volume delivery to

422

the standard patient. This pattern is expected due to the continuous delivered volume maintained

423

by the machine; therefore, the Vent-Lock FloRest allowed regulation of the ratio, the

424

standard/variable patient tidal volume ratio (Fig. 4B). This ratio pattern of control is seen in both

425

ventilator volume control settings in the simulation center and replicated in vivo swine studies

426

using anesthesia gas machines (Fig. 5). The variation in both patients may be difficult for

427

clinicians to manage simultaneously. However, this ratio-based control delivered by Vent-Lock

428

FloRest can be critical for splitting legacy ventilators or anesthesia gas machines that may only

429

have volume control settings. One of the biggest challenges of splitting patients on ventilators is

430

that air will preferentially travel to the patient with the highest baseline lung compliance

431

resulting in unequal ventilation between the two patients. However, if Vent-Lock FloRest is

432

placed on the patient with the highest baseline lung compliance (variable patient), air flow can be

433

decreased, while simultaneously increasing air flow to the standard patient, until tidal volumes

434

are equilibrated between the two. Consequently, while we demonstrate that flow restriction

435

provides tidal volume control on ventilator pressure or volume control settings through different

436

mechanisms. We emphasize that especially during emergency use settings, providers appreciate

437

these differences in tidal volume control mechanisms, and select the setting most appropriate for

438

patients and practice settings.

439

It is important to note that we validated ventilation multiplexing using anesthesia gas

440

machines. Anesthesia gas machines have ventilation functions, and are widely available globally,

441

even in developing countries. They are well suited to be repurposed for ICU ventilation in the

442

face of ventilator shortages, and considerations for modification and usage settings have been

443

addressed 24. Our study provides follow up that in emergency situations, anesthesia gas machines

444

can potentially be multiplexed to ventilate multiple patients using the Vent-Lock 3DP circuit.

445

In companion with the Vent-Lock FloRest, we also produced a manometer adaptor (Fig.

446

5A) that can fit standardized disposable manometers commonly found in hospital settings, such

447

as the Ambu Disposable Pressure Monitor (Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark). When the

448

manometer adaptor is placed in the Vent-Lock circuit, it allows for the continuous monitoring of

449

pressures. This is particularly important as the ventilator reported values may not accurately

450

reflect conditions of both patients and the rapidly changing states of both patients need to be

451

monitored with subsequent adjustments to pressures. We do note that while the manometer

452

adaptor with the manometer provides accurate readings (Fig. 5B), it is limited by the sensitivity

453

of the manometers for clinical use. Furthermore, using the manometer and adapter allows for real

454

time monitoring and facilitates individual control of PEEP with use of the Vent-Lock FloRest.

455

When the FloRest is placed on the expiratory loop of the patient, restriction of airflow results in

456

pressure increases between the patient and the FloRest, effectively functioning as PEEP (Fig.

457

5C), which can then be reported by the manometer and adapter. This PEEP change established

458

by FloRest and continuous monitoring does not affect the other patient split on the ventilator.

459

Therefore, this is a critical asset of the circuit that allows for more patient-tailored PEEP therapy

460

which is especially important in the treatment of patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 or other

461

lung pathologies. While most PEEP valves currently rely on a spring-loaded control system, this

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.16.20195230; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

462

may be difficult to produce rapidly, especially via additive manufacturing. Our design

463

demonstrates control of expiratory pressures through flow restriction. However, we do note

464

challenges with FloRest in creating PEEP control, including that the PEEP was not changed until

465

near complete occlusion of the valve, at which point additional turns resulted in rapid changes in

466

PEEP (Fig. 5C). Consequently, we recognize that Vent-Lock FloRest requires further

467

optimization prior to clinical usage, but exists as a proof-of-concept that PEEP control may be

468

possible through a spring-less system.

469

Some limitations to our study include lack of human testing. While the swine in this

470

study had similar lung compliances which allowed us to show that the device was able to restrict

471

flow and that there is a finite tidal volume that is necessary and it is unknown how well this

472

reflects human physiology. In addition to urgent need, challenges in continuous monitoring must

473

be addressed prior to human studies. Future directions include developing a more rigorous

474

continuous monitoring of flow rates and delivered tidal volumes to patients to facilitate

475

adjustments of flow per FloRest. This is critical due to the dynamic lung physiologies of patients

476

with ARDS and preventing barotrauma or under or over ventilation. Therefore, we recommend

477

setting a target lung volume per patient, and monitoring via spirometry or airflow transducers,

478

such as the ones used in our swine studies (SS11LB airflow transducer (Biopac; Goleta, CA)).

479

Patient lung volumes and their oxygenation statuses should be spot checked with the spirometer

480

or transducers and arterial blood gases. Lastly, we emphasize that ventilator multiplexing is only

481

to be used in emergency situations after all alternatives have been exhausted. Despite our

482

findings of improved ventilator multiplexing functions with Vent-Lock and Vent-Lock FloRest,

483

additional studies are required to validate the safety and clinical considerations prior to

484

translation to human subjects. However, as future pandemics and disasters may exhaust standard-

485

of-care for patient ventilation, Vent-Lock exists as a solution if “the other option is death” 25.

486

During the COVID-19 pandemic, open sourcing has been used to expedite the creation of

487

vital personal protective equipment (PPE) by sharing files for the creation of masks, face shields

488

and ventilator adjuncts. Open sourcing and 3D printing have been proven to be helpful in the

489

developing world by providing low cost, easy to use medical products, low cost construction of

490

homes, water treatment devices and prosthetic limbs

491

produce Vent-Lock circuit and Vent-Lock FloRest allows for the rapid, on-demand, on-site

492

production to meet immediate needs. However, we recognize that our recommendation to use

493

specific medical grade materials that are easily sterilized can limit production in the developing

494

world. Further tests should be performed in varying material types to ensure accuracy in the

495

printing process and translation into actual use. While it is promising that our materials have

496

remained stable in humidified 40 oC for over 48 hours (fig. S3), we note that the material appears

497

more brittle after multiple autoclave cycles, and thus further testing is required to ascertain

498

stability across pressure gradients over weeks to months of use. Thus, we recommend single use

499

of the devices until further investigation.

26

. Thus, utilization of 3D printing to

500

Additionally, we do recognize that the value of Vent-Lock circuit is also in its ability to

501

be stored in preparation of emergency situations, such as disaster preparedness or in military

502

combat zones, where ventilator shortages can be expected. In this case, we believe that while 3D

503

printing production can meet initial interests, traditional manufacturing (such as injection

504

molding), may be a more cost-effective and time-efficient approach to fulfil demand. While

505

Vent-Lock circuit components are not currently optimized for traditional manufacturing, the

506

designs can easily be modified to allow for this production modality, while still maintaining

507

access to 3D print for instances where manufacturing infrastructure is unavailable to produce this

508

device. Consequently, we believe that open sourced 3D printing methodology of Vent-Lock

509

production is appropriate for scalability in the face of urgent demand, such as the COVID-19

510

pandemic, but can also be transitioned into traditional manufacturing.

511

In this study, we developed Vent-Lock, a ventilator or anesthesia gas machine splitter

512

system with a flow restrictor (FloRest) that can modify flow rates per patient for patient tailored

513

therapies. We provide proof-of-concept that two swine can be safely split using one anesthesia

514

gas machine. While additional work is critical for the safe use of ventilator multiplexing, our

515

data supports the feasible use of ventilator splitting for emergency situations, such as in face of

516

COVID-19.

circuit was tested using test lungs simulating healthy lungs with variable compliances (Standard

patient: Rp = 2 cmH2O/L/s, RespiTrainer Advance, QuickLung, IngMar Medical; Variable

560

patient: Rp= 50 cmH2O/L/s, ASL 5000, IngMar Medical). Intrapulmonary data for both patients

561

were collected; data included peak inspiratory pressures, tidal volumes, and peak end expiratory

562

pressures. Five total values of tidal volume per data set were collected and averaged.

563

Corresponding ventilator reported data was also recorded, including total expiratory volumes,

564

peak inspiratory pressures, mean inspiratory pressures, and peak end expiratory pressures. Flow

1+n(1) circuit (Fig. 1). Valve handles were turned at smallest increments permissible to close the

569

valve and documented as % closure. Corresponding intrapulmonary data and ventilator reported

570

values were collected per handle closure and standardized to values (volumes and pressures) of a

571

fully open valve (reported as proportion of maximum, %).

572

In vitro studies were also conducted at the Washington University Simulation Center

573

using two Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva anesthesia machines. One machine was set to deliver pressure

574

control ventilation in a manner similar to that performed at Johns Hopkins. This machine was

connected in parallel to a 2L anesthesia bag reservoir and a second Datex-Ohmeda Aestiva

576

machine that was set to spontaneous ventilation. The second machine served as a flow and

578

In vivo swine studies. Experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care

579

and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

580

Committee of Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO). Domestic swine (Sus

581

scrofa domesticus) were purchased from Oak Hill Genetics (Ewing, IL). The swine were

582

females, 72 kg each, 5 months old, and were Landrace-cross swine. Swine were sedated with a

583

telazol, ketamine, xylazine cocktail and intubated with a 7.0 endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was

584

maintained with isoflurane. Femoral venous and arterial catheterization was performed. Standard

585

ASA monitoring was maintained throughout the experiment. Swine were ventilated using a

586

single ventilator (Drager Narkomed 2A) with two circuits in parallel in an 1+n(1) configuration

587

with cross-ventilation restricted by using one-way check valves. Ventilation was maintained with

588

volume control. One swine was not flow-regulated and thus considered the standard patient,

589

while the other had a Vent-Lock 3DP 4.0 connected in the inspiratory limb and thus considered

590

the variable patient. Flow was measured at each expiatory limb with a SS11LB airflow

591

transducer (Biopac; Goleta, CA). Flow data were collected at 2kHz using an MP36 data

592

acquisition unit and BSL 4.1.3 software (Biopac; Goleta, CA). The spirometry data was then

593

smoothed with a 0.25 sec wide moving median filter after removal of instrument noise below

594

0.08 L/sec (determined by histogram inspection). The smoothed data was then numerically

595

integrated to estimate respiratory tidal volume, and a first order numeric derivative was used to

596

calculate the instantaneous respiratory rate. The noise floor for the integrated volume was

597

determined by histogram inspection resulting in a threshold of 90 mL. The anesthesia record and

598

the spirometry results were then aligned using common timestamps. All breaths spontaneously

599

initiated by the swine (identified by respiratory rates more than 30% away from the ventilator set

600

point) were removed from analysis. The mean and standard deviation for each anesthesia record

601

entry were calculated for respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, and lung compliance.

602

All of the described analysis was performed using a custom MATLAB script (MATLAB 2019b,

603

The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA)]. Arterial and venous blood gas data were collected 15

604

minutes following any changes to the Vent-Lock 3DP device. Following the procedure, swine

605

were euthanized with an overdose (~150mg/kg) of supersaturated potassium chloride IV while

606

under anesthesia. Necropsy was performed to assess for any gross lung pathology.

with a ventilator on pressure control using simulation lungs at varying compliances demonstrates

that Vent-Lock FloRest provides more control options than commercial ball valves and gate

valves, characterized by more available data points corresponding with different tidal volumes

of controlling tidal volumes delivered to the variable patient per turn, with no change to tidal

volumes delivered to the standard patient. (B) PIP of the standard patient remains stable, despite

730

changing PIP of the variable patient. Using a ventilator on pressure control, we determine the

changes in standard and variable patient breathing pressures with closure of the Vent-Lock

733

variable patient decreases with closure, while the standard patient PIP, and ventilator reported

average breathing pressures (Pavg), and PEEP remain constant. We do note an increase in the

ventilator or anesthesia gas machine on volume control mode ventilating two simulated

patients with different lung compliances. (A) With the ventilator on volume control, decreases

742

in variable patient tidal volumes result in increases in tidal volumes delivered to the standard

743

patient. This indicates that in volume control mode, patient ventilation circuits are

744

interdependent, and changes in one patient effects the other. (B) The ratios of the patient’s tidal

747

changes in peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of the standard patient and variable patient reflect that

748

of tidal volume changes, while the ventilator reported PIP and Pavg increase, and PEEP remains

749

stable. (D)Vent-Lock FloRest was tested at Washington University in St. Louis using anesthesia
