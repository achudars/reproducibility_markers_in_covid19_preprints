Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread stealthily and presented a tremendous
threat to the public. It is important to investigate the transmission dynamic of COVID19 to help understand the impact of the disease on public health and economy. While a
number of epidemic models have been available to study infectious diseases, they are inadequate to describe the dynamic of COVID-19. In this paper, we develop a new epidemic
model which utilizes a set of ordinary differential equations with unknown parameters to
delineate the transmission process of COVID-19. Different from the traditional epidemic
models, this model accounts for asymptomatic infections as well the lag between symptoms onset and the confirmation date of infection. We describe an estimation procedure
for the unknown parameters in the proposed model by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble
adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm to the reported number of confirmed cases.
To assess the performance of our proposed model, we examine COVID-19 data in Quebec
for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 and carry out sensitivity studies under a
variety of assumptions. To reflect the transmission potential of an infected case, we derive
the basic reproduction number from the proposed model. The estimated basic reproduction
number suggests that the pandemic situation in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to
May 10, 2020 is not under control.

1 Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread stealthily and has present a tremendous threat to the
public health. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 to be a global pandemic. The first COVID-19 case in Canada was identified in Toronto on
January 25, 2020 (The Canadian Press, 2020). In the early stage, imported cases from other
countries were the main source of the COVID-19 outbreak in Canada. On March 16, 2020,
the closure of Canadian borders was announced to people who are not Canadian citizens or
permanent residents (Vogel, 2020). Various measures and interventions have been taken by the
federal government and provincial governments to mitigate the virus spread.
While those steps are important to help contain the virus transmissions, it is imperative to investigate the transmission dynamic from the quantitative perspectives. In the literature, a variety
of epidemic models have been developed to study infectious diseases, including the SusceptibleInfectious-Recovered (SIR) model (e.g., Kermack and McKendrick, 1927), the SusceptibleInfectious-Susceptible (SIS) model (e.g., Duan et al., 2015), the Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousRecovered (SEIR) model (e.g., Duan et al., 2015), the Reed-Frost model (e.g., Abbey, 1952),
and their variants (e.g., Ng and Orav, 1990; Ng, Turinici, and Danchin, 2003). Applications
of those epidemic models have been extensive. To name a few, Osthus et al. (2017) used the
SIR model to forecast seasonal influenza; Shah and Gupta (2013) applied the SEIR model to
examine transmission processes of vector borne diseases; Ng and Orav (1990) proposed a generalized Reed-Frost model to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence in San
Francisco’s homosexual population; and Ng et al. (2003) developed a modified SEIR model,
called the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Protection (SEIRP) model, to study the
outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China.

While many epidemic models are available, they are inadequate to facilitate the unique epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new epidemic model,
called the Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Symptomatic-Active-Removed (SEASAR) model,
to delineate the COVID-19 transmission dynamic. This model generalizes the SIR and SEIR
models by accounting for asymptomatic infections and the lag between symptoms onset and
the diagnosis time, yet it does not require more assumptions required by the SIR and SEIR
models. Consistent with many epidemic models, we make two rountine assumptions: (1) the
population is homogeneous and well-mixed; and (2) there are no inbound and outbound travels.
Similar to the SIR and SEIR models, the SEASAR model is a deterministic model which utilizes differential equations to describe the transmission dynamic of COVID-19. Furthermore,
we derive the basic reproduction number from the proposed model to provide a scalar measure
of the pandemic.
To implement the proposed model, we develop an estimation procedure for the model parameters by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm
(e.g., Li et al., 2020), where resampling from Bayesian posterior distributions is basically invoked. We evaluate the performance of our transmission model and the estimation algorithm
by analyzing the COVID-19 data in Quebec for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020,
where we focus on comparing differences between the predicted cumulative numbers of cases
and the reported cumulative numbers of cases. We also conduct sensitivity analyses to assess
how the estimation of the model parameters and the predicted results may change as the model
assumptions are altered.
Analyzing the COVID-19 data in Quebec is driven by the following considerations. Quebec
is the worst-hit province in Canada, and it is thereby interesting to examine the virus transmissions in this province. More importantly, it is imperative to ensure the required conditions to be
met as much as possible when applying the model to analyze data. As pointed out earlier, the

validity of the proposed SEASAR model hinges on the assumption of no inbound and outbound
travels, which is typically untrue in practice, but modeling data in a certain period is likely to
make this assumption approximately true. For the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020,
Quebec government set up checkpoints to block all non-essential travels into the province and
people in Quebec were advised to stay home, thus, inbound and outbound travels in Quebec for
this time window are perceived to be the least.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. We develop the SEASAR model and
elaborate on its rationale in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the initialization setup of the
SEASAR model and describe the implementation procedure by adapting the IF-EAKF algorithm. In Section 4, we utilize the proposed SEASAR model to analyze the Quebec COVID-19
data for the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020. The article is concluded with a discussion
presented in Section 5.

2 Model Framework
With a meta analysis, He et al. (2020) estimated that about 46% individuals with COVID-19 are
asymptomatic, and they have the infectious ability to transmit the disease (e.g., Hao et al., 2020;
Li et al., 2020). Due to the limited testing resources and the flu-like manifestation of COVID-19
as well as the incubation period, there is a time lag between symptoms onset and being confirmed for infected individuals (Kramer et al., 2020). To facilitate these features of COVID-19,
we develop a new model, called the Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Symptomatic-ActiveRemoved (SEASAR) model, under the assumptions of a well-mixed homogeneous population
and of no inbound and outbound travels (i.e., the population size remains to be unchanged over
time).

2.1

Illustration of the Proposed Model

To illustrate the ideas, we first consider a static framework by focusing at a given time point,
say, on a given day. We divide the target population into six subpopulations with specific features, where S represents the subpopulation of susceptible cases (i.e., those at risk of becoming
infected with the novel coronavirus), E is the subpopulation of exposed cases (i.e., those who
are infected but do not have the infectious ability yet and are still in the latent period (e.g., Peng
et al., 2020), Ia stands for the subpopulation of asymptomatic infections (i.e., those with the
infectious ability but showing no symptoms), Is represents the subpopulation of symptomatic
infections (i.e., those who show symptoms and have the infectious ability but are not confirmed
yet), A is the subpopulation of active cases (i.e., those confirmed cases who do not recover or
die), and R denotes the subpopulation of removed cases (i.e., those confirmed cases who recover
or die from COVID-19).
Next, we introduce the parameters to facilitate the dynamic changes among the subpopulations. Let Z denote the average latent period, defined as the average time from being infected
to having the infectious ability. Various studies have been conducted to estimate the value of Z
(e.g., Bai et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; He, Yi, and Zhu, 2020), so here we take Z as being
available. Let θ denote the symptomatic transmission rate, defined as the average number of
individuals infected by a symptomatic case per unit time (e.g., a day). Let the asymptomatic
transmission rate be denoted as µθ, which is defined as the average number of individuals infected by an asymptomatic case per unit time. As asymptomatic infections are regarded as less
infectious than symptomatic cases (e.g., Li et al., 2020), µ is a constant between 0 and 1. Let α
denote the fraction of symptomatic infections relative to all infections, let β denote the average
rate for asymptomatic infections to develop symptoms per unit time, and let γ denote the average recovery rate of asymptomatic infections per unit time. Let F stand for the average time
from symptoms onset to the time of being confirmed, let B denote the average time from being

confirmed to being recovered, and let J represent the average time from being confirmed to die.
Figure 1 is a flow chart showing the relationship among the six subpopulations. A black
solid arrow between two subpopulations indicates the members of one subpopulation can move
into the other subpopulation; a red dashed arrow between two subpopulations indicates that
members in one subpopulation can be infected by members in the other subpopulation. Once
COVID-19 cases are confirmed, they will be quarantined and lose the infectious ability, so the
group S cannot be infected by the group A. Due to the limited test capacity, asymptomatic
individuals are not being tested for COVID-19 (especially in the early stage of the outbreak).
Thus, there is no transition from Ia to A. The parameters on black solid lines determine the
number of people who change from one state to another state per unit time; and the parameters
on red dashed lines determine the number of people infected by asymptomatic or symptomatic
cases per unit time.

2.2

Dynamic Model

Figure 1 shows a static chart for the transmissions among the six subpopulations at a given time
point. However, for any time period, the transmissions are not static but dynamic. To characterize the dynamic evolution of the subpopulations over time, we modify the six subpopulations
by showing their dependence on time t, yielding the state components {S(t), E(t), Ia (t), Is (t),
A(t), R(t)}. For ease of notation, we also use the same symbols to represent the sizes of those
state components. Let φ(t) = (S(t), E(t), Ia (t), Is (t), A(t), R(t))T denote the vector of the six
subpopulation sizes at time t.
Given the setup, we now present the proposed SEASAR model, given by the following set
of ordinary differential equations:

where N is the population size, which is time-invariant due to the assumptions of no outbound
and inbound travels. Because of this assumption, S(t) + E(t) + Ia (t) + Is (t) + A(t) + R(t) = N
for any time point t, and hence, any equation above is determined by other five equations.
For ease of referral of equations (1)-(6) in the later development, we express those equations
in a compact form:
dφ(t)
= g(φ(t), η),
dt
where g(·, ·) represents the vector function determined by the right hand side of (1)-(6). Fig7

ure 2 is a flowchart of the transmission dynamic for the six subpopulations together with the
associated values.
The right hand side of each of equations (1)-(6) shows how the change rate of each subpopulation is related to the transmission rates as well as the associated parameters defined earlier.
To see why, we first examine the right hand side of (1) by considering a small time interval [t, t + ∆t) of length ∆t. Over the time interval [t, t + ∆t), because θIs (t)∆t represents
the average number of people infected by symptomatic infections and
of susceptible cases, so

equals the average number of susceptible cases who are

infected by symptomatic infections; similarly,

equals the average number of sus-

ceptible cases who are infected by asymptomatic infections. Thus,

is S(t + ∆t) − S(t) = − θS(t)INs (t)∆t + µθS(t)INa (t)∆t . Then dividing ∆t on the both sides and

letting ∆t → 0 yields (1).
Equations (2)-(6) can be illustrated in an analogous way. Regarding (2), due to the changing
from susceptible cases to being in the exposed state, the number of exposed cases is increased
by

µθS(t)Ia (t)∆t
N

+ θS(t)INs (t)∆t over the interval [t, t + ∆t); yet due to the latent period, the number

of exposed cases is reduced by

E(t)∆t
Z

over the interval [t, t + ∆t), yielding that the difference

in the number of exposed cases over the time interval [t, t + ∆t) is E(t + ∆t) − E(t) =
µθS(t)Ia (t)∆t
N

+ θS(t)INs (t)∆t − E(t)∆t
. Dividing ∆t on the both sides and letting ∆t → 0 yields (2).
Z

Regarding (3), when exposed cases pass the latent period, they become either asymptomatic
or symptomatic infections. As the fraction of asymptomatic infections is 1 − α, the number
of asymptomatic infections is thus increased by (1 − α) E(t)∆t
over the interval [t, t + ∆t).
Z
On the other hand, βIa (t)∆t is the average number of infections who initially are asymptomatic but later show symptoms over the interval [t, t + ∆t) (i.e., people in this group turn
from the asymptomatic state to the symptomatic state), and γIa (t)∆t is the average number of
asymptomatic infections who recover from COVID-19 (i.e., people in this group move from
the asymptomatic state to the removed state). Thus, the number of asymptomatic infections is
reduced by βIa (t)∆t + γIa (t)∆t over the interval [t, t + ∆t). Therefore, the difference in the
−βIa (t)∆t−γIa (t)∆t,
number of asymptomatic infections is Ia (t+∆t)−Ia (t) = (1−α) E(t)∆t
Z
yielding (3) by dividing ∆t on the both sides and letting ∆t → 0.
Regarding (4), due to the change of individuals from the exposed and asymptomatic states to
the symptomatic state, the number of symptomatic infections is increased by α E(t)∆t
+βIa (t)∆t
Z
over the interval [t, t + ∆t). On the other hand,

Is (t)∆t
F

is the average number of symptomatic

infections who are confirmed over the interval [t, t + ∆t) (i.e., people in this group turn from
the symptomatic state to the active state); in other words, the reduced number of symptomatic
infections over the interval [t, t + ∆t) is

Is (t)∆t
.
F

Thus, the difference in the number of symp-

tomatic infections is Is (t + ∆t) − Is (t) = α E(t)∆t
− Is (t)∆t
+ βIa (t)∆t, leading to (4) if dividing

Regarding (5), due to the changing from the symptomatic state to the active state, the number
of active cases is increased by

is the average number of active

2.3

Basic Reproduction Number

Let η = (θ, µ, α, β, γ, F, B, J)T denote the vector of parameters of prime interest. Knowing the
value of η allows us to describe the six subpopulations sizes using the models (1)-(6). Further, it
enables us to describe the severity of the pandemic using some simple measure such as the basic
reproduction number, denoted R0 , which is defined as the expected number of cases infected
by one case in a population consisting of individuals susceptible to infection.
A large value of R0 indicates a more severe pandemic. Usually, comparing R0 to 1 describes
the spread of the disease. “R0 > 1” suggests that the infection is spreading in the population,
and “R0 < 1” indicates the dying down situation. In Appendix A, we show that the mathematical expression of R0 derived from the SEASAR model is
R0 =

θ(F αγ + βF − µα + µ)

3 Estimation Procedure
In this section, we develop an estimation procedure for η by adapting the iterated filter-ensemble
adjustment Kalman filter (IF-EAKF) algorithm (e.g., Li et al., 2020) in combination with the
4th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method (e.g., Süli and Mayers, 2003, p.328).

3.1 Initial Sizes of Subpopulations
Let τ0 denote the initial time point from which we start examining the data. By time τ0 , let Rc ,
C0 and D0 denote the reported cumulative number of recoveries, confirmed cases and deaths
from COVID-19, respectively, which are available; and let Ra denote the cumulative number of
recovered asymptomatic cases, which is unavailable. Let Q(t) denote the number of reported
cases with symptoms onset on day t.
To facilitate the relationship between the observed and unobserved values, let r1 =
denote the ratio of the unobserved Ra to the observed Rc , and let r2 =

Ia (τ0 )
Is (τ0 )

Ra
Rc

represent the ratio

of unobserved size Ia (τ0 ) to the reported size Is (τ0 ). Motived by Hao et al. (2020), we express
the size E(τ0 ) in terms of its relative value to the total number of reported cases with symptoms
P 0 +Z]
onset over the time window of length Z, E(τ0 ) = r3 × [τ
t=τ0 Q(t), where the function [x]
represents the biggest integer that is less than or equal to x, and r3 is a positive value.
While the introduction of the ratios r1 , r2 and r3 does not give us a way to determine the unobserved values Ra , Ia (τ0 ) and E(τ0 ) using the observed data, these ratios offer us convenient
measures to describe the pandemic situation in relative scales of the observed values at time τ0 .
For instance, at the early stage of the pandemic, the testing kits are limited, so the number of
recoveries from confirmed cases is likely to be a lot smaller than that from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting a large value of r1 . If r2 is bigger than 1, then there are more asymptomatic
infections than symptomatic infections.
Table 1 summarizes the initial sizes of the six subpopulations which are to be used in Section
11

Initialization of Model Parameters

Estimation of η, to be described in Section 3.3, is conducted by an iterative approximation
procedure using the posterior distributions of η. Here we assume the prior information for the
parameters to be non-informative except for constraining the parameters to certain ranges to
reflect our a priori knowledge about them.
To be specific, the transmission rate θ of symptomatic infections is considered to be 0 ≤
θ ≤ 7 to cover the reported values in the literature, including Hao et al. (2020) and Li et al.
(2020). The multiplicative factor µ is assumed to satisfy 0.1 ≤ µ ≤ 1, the fraction α of
symptomatic infections relative to all infections is restricted to be 0.1 ≤ α ≤ 1, the average

rate β of asymptomatic infections who develop symptoms per unit time is constrained to be
0.0002 ≤ β ≤ 0.8, and the average recovery rate γ of asymptomatic infections per unit time is
set as 0.1 ≤ γ ≤ 1. The average time F from symptoms onset to being confirmed is considered
to be between 1 and 10 days based on the study of Kramer et al. (2020). Based on the WHO
report (WHO, 2020), the average time B from being confirmed to being recovered is considered
to be in the range of 7 to 42 days, and the average time J from being confirmed to die is taken
to change from 14 to 56 days.

3.3

IF-EAKF algorithm

With the setup in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we describe an estimation procedure by adapting the
iterated filtering (IF) algorithm. The IF approach basically produces the maximum likelihood
estimates of model parameters and has been successfully applied to study many infectious diseases (Li et al., 2020), including cholera (e.g., King et al., 2008) and measles (e.g., He et al.,
2010). An efficient IF approach roots in using the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF)
which can generate satisfactory results with only hundreds of samples (Li et al., 2020).
Since the number of confirmed cases is reported on a daily basis, we take the time unit as
a day. Consider a population of interest. In contrast to the number Q(t) of reported cases with
symptoms onset on day t, defined in Section 3.1, we let Y (t) denote the number of confirmed
cases to be reported on day t, which is regarded as a random variable, and let yt denote its
realization. Let Ŷ (t) =

Is (t)
F

denote the number of confirmed cases on day t that is generated

from the SEASAR model. We assume that Y (t) and Ŷ (t) are connected through the model
log Y (t) = log Ŷ (t) + t ,

(7)

where the t are independent of each other and of the Ŷ (t), φ(t) and η; and t follows a Gaussian
distribution with mean 0 and time-dependent variance σt2 .

Being called the observational error variance (OEV) by Li et al. (2020), σt2 is often estimated heuristically via an assumed function form of the observations. For example, in the
analysis in Section 4.2, σt2 is assumed to be
σt2



log yt
= max 1,

for t ≥ τ0 .

(8)

Similar forms of OEV were used in the studies of other infectious diseases, including influenza
(e.g., Pei et al., 2018), Ebola (e.g., Shaman et al., 2014), West Nile virus (e.g., DeFelice et al.,
2017), and respiratory syncytial virus (e.g., Reis and Shaman, 2016).
The model parameter η for (1)-(6), the subpopulation sizes φ(t) and Ŷ (t) at time t for t ≥ τ0
are unknown. One may consider the joint posterior distribution of η, log Ŷ (t) and log φ(t),
and then use the mean of the posterior distribution of η to estimate η, where log φ(t) :=
(log S(t), log E(t), log Ia (t), log Is (t), log A(t), log R(t))T . To reduce computation costs, we
adapt the discussion of (Anderson, 2001, p.2888) and describe a simple iterative procedure by
pairing two members in {η, log Ŷ (t), log φ(t)}, where we typically pair log Ŷ (t) with each
component in {η, log φ(t)}. Let τ0 + T − 1 denote the time point by which we stop iterations.
To see the main ideas, here we elaborate on the detail of the first iteration for the IF-EAKF algorithm which includes the following six stages, with similar details for other iterations omitted.
• Stage 1: At time t = τ0 , generate prior values for η and Ŷ (t):
– Step 1: Let πη denote a prior distribution for parameter η, which is taken as the
uniform distribution over the ranges specified in Section 3.2, with the assumption
that the parameter components in η are independent of each other.
– Step 2: Specify a positive integer, say n. Then generate n values from πη , denoted

of the prior distribution πη which is shrunk by a discount factor a ∈ (0, 1), usually pre-specified
to reduce the variance of the posterior distribution of the parameters as the iteration progresses.
Using a discount factor is a standard procedure to ensure that xL in Algorithm 1, the estimate
at the Lth iteration, is nearly identical to the maximum likelihood estimate of η. If a is too
small, the algorithm may “quench” too fast and fail to find the maximum likelihood estimate;
if it is too close to 1, the algorithm may not converge in a reasonable time (see Li et al., 2020,
Supplementary Materials, p.8). Practically, a can range between 0.9 to 0.99. The number L of
iterations is set in an ad hoc way, often determined by inspecting the evolution of the posterior
parameter distributions (see Li et al., 2020, Supplementary Materials, p.8). The scale of n is in
hundreds, though in principle, the larger the better.

4 Data Analysis
4.1

Quebec COVID-19 Data

On April 1, 2020, Quebec provincial government in Canada set up checkpoints to block all
non-essential travels into the province and advised people in Quebec to stay home. After May
10, 2020, Quebec and other provinces in Canada gradually reopened the economy, yielding
inbound and outbound travels in Quebec. Therefore, it is reasonable to perceive inbound and
outbound travels in the period of April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 in Quebec to be the least, and
the assumption of no inbound and outbound travels required by the proposed SEASAR model
is relatively feasible for the Quebec COVID-19 data in this period.
Driven by this, we apply the proposed model to analyze the daily reported number of
COVID-19 cases in Quebec, Canada, in this period, available at https://www.canada.ca/en/publichealth/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html. We take the initial time point
τ0 as April 2, 2020 and split the study period into two parts: the period of April 1 to April 30,
2020, and the period of May 1 to May 10, 2020. The data for the first period are used to estimate

the model parameters by applying Algorithm 1, and the data in the second period are used to
assess the prediction performance of our proposed model.

4.2

Estimation of Model Parameters

We run Algorithm 1 to the proposed SEASAR model, where we set n = 300, a = 0.9, L = 50,
and the average latent period Z is taken as 5.2 days, an estimate reported by Bai et al. (2020)
and Hao et al. (2020). For the initial sizes of the six subpopulations discussed in Section 3.1,
we take r1 = 2, r2 = 1, and r3 = 2. As described in Section 3.1, the initial sizes of subpopulations depend on the daily number of COVID-19 patients with symptoms onset before May 10,
2020, which is not available in Quebec. However, the daily number of COVID-19 patients with
symptoms onset in Canada is collected by the Public Health Agency of Canada (https://healthinfobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html). Using this information, we approximate the daily number of COVID-19 patients with symptoms onset before
May 10, 2020 in Quebec. Specifically, let nt,C denote the number of COVID-19 patients with
symptoms onset on day t in Canada, and let mt,C and mt,Q denote the number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases on day t in Canada and Quebec, respectively. We then take

nt,C mt,Q
mt,C

as an

estimated number of COVID-19 patients with symptoms onset on day t in Quebec.
To account for stochastic effects, we run the IF-EAKF algorithm 1000 times and display in
Figure 4 the histograms for those estimates. A 95% confidence interval (CI) for each parameter
is determined by using the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the 1000 estimates as its lower and
upper bounds, respectively. Table 2 reports the average estimates and the associated 95% CIs for
the parameters, together with the average of those 1000 estimated basic reproduction numbers
and its associated 95% CI. The estimate of R0 suggests that the pandemic situation in Quebec
for the period of April 2, 2020 to April 30, 2020 is not under control and the virus spread
continues.

Dynamic Projection of Subpopulation Sizes

To project possible trajectories of the pandemic in Quebec, Canada, we are interested in visualizing the estimated sizes for the six subpopulations in the next 1000 days. To this end, let η̂
denote the vector of the parameter estimates reported in Table 2. Let k̂1 (t) = g(φ(t), η̂), k̂2 (t) =
g(φ(t)+ k̂12(t) , η̂), k̂3 (t) = g(φ(t)+ k̂22(t) , η̂), and k̂4 (t) = g(φ(t)+ k̂3 (t), η̂). Then similar to (11),
we apply the RK4 method to estimate φ(t) recursively for t = τ0 + 1, τ0 + 2, · · · , τ0 + 1000:
φ̂(t + 1) = φ̂(t) +

k̂1 (t) + 2k̂2 (t) + 2k̂3 (t) + k̂4 (t)
,

where the initial value φ(τ0 ) is given in Section 3.1.
Figure 3 presents smooth lines connecting the estimates of an element of φ̂(t) for the time
points from t = τ0 to t = τ0 +1000, where S(τ0 ) is roughly equal to N −Ê(τ0 )−Iˆa (τ0 )−Iˆs (τ0 )−
Â(τ0 ) − R̂(τ0 ), with Ê(τ0 ), Iˆa (τ0 ), Iˆs (τ0 ), Â(τ0 ) and R̂(τ0 ) respectively denoting estimates for
the corresponding subpopulation size and N being the population size of Quebec. Figure 3
shows the patterns that may be useful for us to project the pandemic evolution in Quebec in
the next 1000 days if no interference measures are taken. The susceptible subpopulation size
S(t) decreases monotonically, suggesting that as time goes by, more people would move to the
subpopulation of exposed cases. E(t), Ia (t), Is (t) and A(t) have similar shape with a single

it becomes fairly flat after 600 days.

4.4 Prediction of Confirmed Cases
With the estimated parameters for the SEASAR model using the data from April 2, 2020 to
April 30, 2020, we now predict the daily number of cases for the period of May 1, 2020 to May
10, 2020, and also compare them to the actually reported daily cases in this period. For each i,
the ith estimate and prediction are generated as follows:
• Step 1: Let η̂i = (θ̂i , µ̂i , α̂i , β̂i , γ̂i , F̂i , B̂i , Jˆi )T denote the ith estimate of parameters, then
Is (τ0 )
F̂i

is the ith estimate of the number of cases on April 2, 2020.

• Step 2: Let k̂1i (t) = g(φ(t), η̂i ), k̂2i (t) = g(φ(t) + k̂1i2(t) , η̂i ), k̂3i (t) = g(φ(t) + k̂2i2(t) , η̂i ),
and k̂4i (t) = g(φ(t) + k̂3i (t), η̂i ), then similar to (11), the ith estimate of the sizes of
the six subpopulations at the beginning of April 3, 2020, denoted φ̂i (τ0 + 1) = (Ŝi (τ0 +

is taken as the ith estimate of the number of cases on April 3, 2020.

Repeating Step 2 for τ0 + 2, · · · , τ0 + 28, we obtain the ith estimate of the daily number of cases
from April 2, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Further repeating Step 2 for τ0 + 29, · · · , τ0 + 38, we
obtain the ith prediction of the daily number of cases from May 1, 2020 to May 10, 2020.

ŷti stands for the predicted number of cases on day t, and yt is the reported number of cases on
day t, defined in Section 3.3. The results are reported in Table 3. Furthermore, Figure 5 displays
the mean estimates of the cumulative number of cases for the period of April 2, 2020 to April
30, 2020 (in green) and the mean predicted cumulative number of cases for the period of May
1, 2020 to May 10, 2020 (in blue), in comparison to the actually reported cumulative number of
cases from April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020 (in red). The fair agreement of the fitted or predicted
values to the reported values suggest the good performance of the proposed SEASAR model.

4.5 Sensitivity Analysis
To further assess the performance of the proposed SEASAR model, we conduct ten sensitivity
analyses to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to the specification of the initial values. We take

The results of sensitivity analyses are reported in Figure 6. While the disparity of the fitted

differences seem to be fairly small, suggesting reasonable robustness of the results to the specification of associated values in fairly realistic ranges. Further, we report in Table 4 the estimate
and associated 95% CIs of the basic reproduction number R0 obtained from those ten sensitivity
analyses. All the estimates are greater than 1, and consequently, the proposed model suggests
the ongoing virus spread under a variety of settings we consider.

5 Discussion
In this paper, we propose a new epidemic model, called the SEASAR model, to describe the
transmission process of COVID-19. Consistent with many available epidemic models, our proposed model require two standard conditions: (1) the population is homogeneous and wellmixed; and (2) the population size remains invariant over time. To facilitate different states
of the individuals in the population, we divide the population into six subpopulations (or compartments), respectively, called susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, active, and
removed. Such a classification allows us to accommodate the unique manifestations of COVID19 which include asymptomatic infections and varying lag times between symptoms onset and
diagnosis. The dynamic changes from compartment to compartment is delineated by ordinary
differntial equations together with unknown parameters or transition rates.
To utilize the proposed model, we examine the COVID-19 data in Quebec, Canada, from
April 2, 2020 to May 10, 2020. Our analysis is conducted under varying assumptions to reflect
different possibilities due to the lack of the precise information. The sensitivity analyses reveal
that the pandemic situation in Quebec, Canada, is not under control for the study period.
The proposed SEASAR model extends several existing epidemic models such as SIR and
SEIR models. It would be interesting to develop more refined models along the same lines of
the current development. For example, one may relax constant model parameters to be timevarying to gain a greater flexibility. Time-varying model parameters may be described by a
parametric form or a weakly parametric form (e.g., piecewise constants over different time
intervals). While the same principle can be applied to develop a procedure for estimating model
parameters, technical details would be more notationally involved, and computation would be
more costly.

Appendix A: Expression of the Basic Reproduction Number
Following the principles of Diekmann et al. (2010), we derive the basic reproduction number
R0 . The basic idea is to extract the information on the production of new infections from the
model, and then calculate the expected number of new infections generated from a case in the
population under the constraint S(t) = N .
Since a confirmed case must be quarantined, any individuals in the compartment of being
active cannot be infectious. In addition, any individuals in the compartments of being susceptible or removed do not have infectious abilities. Therefore, only (2), (3) and (4) in the
SEASAR model involves the information on new infections generated by infected cases who
are not confirmed yet, thus not being quarantined. With the assumption that all individuals in
the populations are susceptible (i.e., setting S(t) = N ), those three equations become

Appendix B: Derivations of the Expressions in Section 3.3
In this appendix, we present the derivations of the expressions used in Section 3.3, and describe the implementation of the IF-EAKF algorithm using the terminology of the “joint stateobservation vector” (see Anderson, 2001, p.2886) which basically includes time-dependent
variables.
For ease of exposition, we let log φ(t) denote the vector (log S(t), log E(t), log Ia (t), log Is (t),
log A(t), log R(t))T . Let the joint state-observation vector at time t be O(t) = (η T , (log φ(t))T ,
log Ŷ (t))T . Because φ(t) is regarded as deterministic at τ0 , the beginning of the study, so when
t = τ0 , O(t) degenerates as O(τ0 ) = (η T , log Ŷ (τ0 ))T . Here applying the logarithm to φ(t) and
Ŷ (t) aligns with the transformation involved with model (7).

The EAKF algorithm basically aims to work out the posterior distribution of the joint stateobservation vector O(t) for t ≥ τ0 . To reduce computation costs, we adopt the discussion
of (Anderson, 2001, p.2888) and consider a simple implementation procedure by examining
O(t) via its paired subvectors separately, where we pair log Ŷ (t) with each of other elements in
O(t) and calculate the posterior distributions for (θ, log Ŷ (t))T , (µ, log Ŷ (t))T , (α, log Ŷ (t))T ,
(β, log Ŷ (t))T , (γ, log Ŷ (t))T , (F, log Ŷ (t))T , (B, log Ŷ (t))T , (J, log Ŷ (t))T , (log S(t), log Ŷ (t))T ,
(log E(t), log Ŷ (t))T ,(log Ia (t), log Ŷ (t))T , (log Is (t), log Ŷ (t))T , (log A(t), log Ŷ (t))T , and
(log R(t), log Ŷ (t))T separately, which employs the same procedure in principle.
To show the ideas, we just describe the way of calculating the posterior distribution of
(θ, log Ŷ (t))T for t ≥ τ0 . Write Zt = (θ, log Ŷ (t))T , and let H = (0, 1) so that HZt =
log Ŷ (t). Rather than attempt to find the analytic expression of the posterior distribution, the
EAKF algorithm generates the posterior values of Zt by using the prior values of Zt and the
i
i
observation yt . To this end, let {θpri,t
: i = 1, · · · , n} and {Ŷpri
(t) : i = 1, · · · , n} denote

sequences of prior values of θ and Ŷ (t) at time t, respectively.
First, we calculate their sample means, sample covariance, and sample variances, which are,

Appendix C: Derivations of the Posterior Distribution of Zt
For ease of notation, we write U = log Y (t) and Z = Zt for any given t ≥ τ0 . Let H1 = (1, 0),
by the fact that Z = (θ, log Ŷ (t))T and H = (0, 1), we have θ = H1 Z and log Ŷ (t) = HZ.
Now we show that U is conditionally independent of H1 Z, given HZ. Indeed, for any
u, z1 , z2 ∈ R, the conditional cumulative distribution function of U and H1 Z, given HZ = z2 ,

is
FU,H1 Z|HZ (u, z1 |z2 ) = P (U ≤ u, H1 Z ≤ z1 |HZ = z2 )
= P (HZ + t ≤ u, H1 Z ≤ z1 |HZ = z2 )
= P (t ≤ u − z2 , H1 Z ≤ z1 |HZ = z2 )
= P (t ≤ u − z2 |HZ = z2 )P (H1 Z ≤ z1 |HZ = z2 )
= P (U ≤ u|HZ = z2 )P (H1 Z ≤ z1 |HZ = z2 )
= FU |HZ (u|z2 )FH1 Z|HZ (z1 |z2 )
where the second equality is due to (7), the fourth equality comes from the assumption that t
is independent of H1 Z, and the second last step is because that P (t ≤ u − z2 |HZ = z2 ) =
P (t ≤ u − HZ|HZ = z2 ) = P (HZ + t ≤ u|HZ = z2 ) = P (U ≤ u|HZ = z2 ) by (7).
Therefore, we conclude that U is independent of H1 Z, given HZ.
Next, we find the conditional distribution of U given Z, fU |Z (u|z), where z = (z1 , z2 )T with
z1 , z2 ∈ R, and u ∈ R. To do this, we use the definition,
fU |Z (u|z) =

fU,Z (u, z)
fZ (z)

(29)

and first determine the joint distribution of U and Z, fU,Z (u, z). By the definition of Z, we have
fU,Z (u, z) = fU,H1 Z,HZ (u, z1 , z2 )
which equals fU,H1 Z|HZ (u, z1 |z2 )fHZ (z2 ). Since U is conditionally independent of H1 Z, given
HZ, therefore, we have that
fU,Z (u, z) = fU |HZ (u|z2 )fH1 Z|HZ (z1 |z2 )fHZ (z2 )
= fU |HZ (u|z2 )fH1 Z,HZ (z1 , z2 )
= fU |HZ (u|z2 )fZ (z),

where the last equality is due to the definition of Z = (H1 Z, HZ)T . Combining (30) and (29)
gives that
fU |Z (u|z) = fU |HZ (u|z2 ),

(31)

which is determined by (7). Therefore, using the original notation, by (31), we obtain the
conditional density function of log Y (t) given Zt ,

Finally, we determine the posterior distribution of Z, i.e., the conditional distribution of
Z given U , fZ|U (z|u). Combining (22) and (32) gives the density function of the posterior
distribution of Zt :
fZt |log Y (t) (zt |log yt ) ∝ fZt (zt ) × flog Y (t)|Zt (log yt |zt )
