Abstract
Background. Although nasopharyngeal (NP) samples have been considered the gold standard
for COVID-19 testing, variability in viral load across different anatomical sites could theoretically
cause NP samples to be less sensitive than saliva or nasal samples in certain cases. Selfcollected samples also have logistical advantages over NP samples, making them amenable to
population-scale screening.
Methods. To evaluate sampling alternatives for population screening, we collected NP, saliva,
and nasal samples from two cohorts with varied levels and types of symptoms.
Results. In a mixed cohort of 60 symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, we found that
saliva had 88% concordance with NP when tested in the same testing lab (n = 41), and 68%
concordance when tested in different testing labs (n = 19). In a second cohort of 20 participants
hospitalized for COVID-19, saliva had 74% concordance with NP tested in the same testing lab,
but detected virus in two participants that tested negative with NP on the same day. Medical
record review showed that the saliva-based testing sensitivity was related to the timing of
symptom onset and disease stage.
Conclusions. We find that no sample site will be perfectly sensitive for COVID-19 testing in all
situations, and the significance of negative results will always need to be determined in the
context of clinical signs and symptoms. Saliva retained high clinical sensitivity while allowing
easier collection, minimizing the exposure of healthcare workers and need for personal
protective equipment, and making it a viable option for population-scale testing.

Introduction
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of infection has significantly outpaced
laboratory testing to identify SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence studies performed in March-May of
2020 in the United States suggested that the number of infections were perhaps 10-fold greater
than confirmed laboratory diagnoses1. This scenario significantly challenged public health efforts
to monitor and contain the spread of disease. Nasopharyngeal (NP) samples have been
considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing. However, alternative samples like selfcollected saliva offer advantages for population-scale screening and may perform well in
specific clinical situations.

A number of studies comparing saliva, oral, and/or nasal samples with NP samples have
reported heterogeneity in sensitivity or positive percent agreement (PPA) ranging from 66%98%2–12; this heterogeneous performance is likely impacted by differences in patient populations
and methods of sample collection and processing. For example, optimization of saliva sample
processing within one institution improved the performance of this sample type across two
sequential studies 3,5. More importantly, clinical test performance is dependent on pre-analytic
variables such as collection timing relative to the patient’s disease course and anatomic site of
collection. A study of inpatients at an advanced disease stage showed that lower respiratory
samples (bronchoalveolar lavage) were more frequently positive (93%) than pharyngeal (32%)
or nasal (63%) samples13. Further studies of samples from different anatomic sites at different
points in disease course are necessary to better understand how these variables impact clinical
test performance.

Here, we acquired patient-collected saliva and anterior nasal research specimens for
comparison with provider-collected NP samples in both outpatient and inpatient settings. The
clinical context of specimen collection, the timing of sample collection during disease course,

and the analytical performance of different molecular tests were assessed for their impact on
the test result agreement between different anatomical sites.

Methods
Study design and cohort definition
Cohort 1 study participants, presenting with both symptomatic and asymptomatic concerns for
COVID-19 were enrolled opportunistically from a population receiving a nasopharyngeal (NP)
COVID-19 test in outpatient screening or emergency department (ED) settings. Due to limited
testing resources available during the study, we relied on NP results from routine clinical testing.
Nasal and saliva samples were prospectively collected and bio-banked for retrospective testing.
After 30 positive cases were detected by clinical NP, enrollment was stopped and 30 negative
cases were randomly selected for comparison.

Due to clinical test triage patterns outside the study’s purview, clinical NP samples were routed
to different test platforms. We divided Cohort 1 into two groups to reflect testing methods used
for the clinical NP test. Cohort 1A (outpatient) had clinical NP samples and bio-banked saliva
and nasal samples tested on our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified
Laboratory Developed Test (CLIA-LDT). Cohort 1B (ED) had clinical NP sample testing
performed on one of two different commercial testing platforms.

Cohort 2 participants were recruited at admission from a population of hospitalized patients who
had previously tested positive for COVID-19. In this group, NP, saliva, and nasal samples were
obtained from participants for concurrent analysis on the CLIA-LDT. Both cohorts were
recruited, consented, and enrolled under protocols approved by the University of Minnesota’s
Institutional Review Board (Cohort 1A and 1B: STUDY00009393, Cohort 2: STUDY00009560).

Sample collection, handling, and biobanking
NP samples were collected by a healthcare provider for all participants; saliva and anterior
nasal samples were patient-collected under direct observation. Study participants were given
saliva testing kits (Item OM-505, DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and anterior nasal
testing kits (Item OCD-100, DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) with written and verbal
instructions from monitoring healthcare workers.

In Cohort 1, liquid saliva samples mixed with buffer and nasal swabs in buffer were transported
at room temperature and stored at -20C, according to instructions from the manufacturer.
Selected research samples were thawed at room temperature immediately prior to analysis on
the CLIA-LDT. In Cohort 1, NP swabs were collected, handled, and processed immediately
according to the normal course of clinical testing through the healthcare system (1A = CLIALDT; 1B = commercial assays).

In Cohort 2, all samples were collected simultaneously within 48 hours of admission. The three
sample types were transported together at room temperature to the CLIA-LDT testing facility,
and processed within 24 hours.

Sample Extraction and Molecular Testing
A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based on primer-probe sets for the
SARS-CoV-2 N gene (N1 and N2 targets) and human control ribonuclease P (RP) published by
the United States Centers for Disease Control was validated for clinical use14 following the
regulatory requirements of CLIA and the Federal Drug Administration’s Emergency Use
Authorization criteria. A sample was reported positive for SARS-CoV-2 if either N1 or N2 viral
targets were detected with Ct < 40 passing data quality control. Negative samples required the
internal RP control was detected with Ct < 38. For saliva and nasal samples obtained in sample

buffer, nucleic acid extraction was performed with the Promega Maxwell RSC Viral Total Nucleic
Acid kit (Cat# AS1330, Promega, Madison, WI) on the Maxwell RSC instrument per
manufacturer’s instructions. For Cohort 1B, NP swab sample testing was performed on the
Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test and the Diasorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay
following manufacturer’s instructions.

Medical record review and symptom scoring
Medical records from telehealth, clinic, or hospital visits were reviewed for relevant symptoms
including: loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, fatigue, diarrhea,
nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite, chest pain, and myalgia or headache. Physician and
nursing notes immediately prior to the initial testing date and over the potentially symptomatic
period (approximately 10-20 days after testing positive) were reviewed. Subjective symptoms
were coded as either present (“Yes”) or absent (“No”) or as (“Mild”, “Moderate”, or “Severe”)
when the medical record stated severity. In cases where an individual reported at least one
symptom; the symptoms that were not reported were considered absent (“No”). In cases where
there was no report of symptoms; symptoms were coded as “NA”. Objective signs of interest
were defined as elevated body temperature (fever) and decreased oxygen saturation based on
documentation in the medical record. Data abstraction from the medical records was completed
by one study author and reviewed for accuracy by a second author.

Statistical analysis
Group mean variation between NP, saliva, and nasal samples were assessed with the KruskalWallis rank sum test. Correlations between methods were assessed using Pearson correlation
coefficient. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess method agreement between saliva or
nasal samples relative to NP. PPA was calculated as the proportion of comparative method
positives where the test method was positive. Overall percent agreement (OPA) was calculated

as the proportion of tests where the test and comparative method agreed. To generate a
symptom heat-map, symptoms were re-coded following the COVID-19 probability score
(P(COVID)) prediction equation by Menni et al.15. Mild cough was re-coded as “No” and only
severe fatigue was coded as “Yes”. Heat map rows are clustered by similarity using the
complete linkage method and columns are sorted by cohort, method concordance, P(COVID),
age, and sex. Average cycle threshold (Ct) was calculated for NP, saliva, and nasal samples as
the mean Ct for N1 and N2. Relative viral load was calculated as ((2^(RP-N1)) + (2^(RP-N2)))/2.
Data analysis and data visualization was completed using R version 3.4.316 and the following
packages: ggplot2 version 3.2.117; cowplot version 0.9.418; tidyverse version 1.3.019; reshape 2

Results
Cohort Characteristics
Two distinct patient cohorts were included in the study (Figure 1). Cohort 1 consisted of 354
patients with clinical NP results from tests in outpatient or ED settings. Analysis per design was
performed on 30 positive and 30 negative samples. The cohort was split into 1A (n=41) and 1B
(n=19) based on heterogeneity of clinical NP test routing. Cohort 2 consisted of 20 inpatients
from a dedicated COVID-19 ward for disease management; all had prior laboratory evidence of
SARS-CoV-2 on clinical testing, but the timing of those results prior to admission was variable
(1 day to 4 weeks).

Figure 1: Cohort flow diagram. Cohort 1 was enrolled prospectively at outpatient screening
and emergency department locations for sample collection and biobanking. When the prespecified 30 positive samples were acquired, retrospective testing of saliva and anterior nasal
samples was performed for 30 positives and 30 randomly selected negative samples.
Heterogeneity in clinical NP test routing during the pandemic response necessitated sub-cohort
analysis of 1A and 1B. Cohort 2 was enrolled and tested prospectively at an inpatient ward
dedicated to COVID-19 patient care. Clinical sensitivity analysis is performed on all 20 patients
enrolled in Cohort 2, while 2 patients were excluded from analytic sensitivity analysis due to
negative test results for all three anatomic sites.
Cohort 1A had an average age of 39.6 years, and was skewed toward female gender at 92.7%
Cohort 1B had an average age of 44.5 years, and was skewed toward male gender at 63.2%.
Symptomatic patients comprised approximately 80% of both Cohorts 1A and 1B, although a
higher proportion of symptomatic patients in Cohort 1B had positive clinical test results (92.3%)
versus 1A (64.3%). Cohort 2 had an average age of 62.5 years, consistent with the increased
hospitalization rate of older COVID-19 patients. Gender was equally distributed in Cohort 2.

Clinical NP testing on different commercial platforms in Cohort 1B (n=19) produced 14 positive
and 5 negative results. Testing banked saliva and nasal samples on the CLIA-LDT provided
more discordant results: the PPA for both saliva and nasal samples compared against NP was
57.1%. Further, there were two discrepancies between nasal and saliva sample results
producing 87.5% PPA and 89.5% OPA between these sample types (Supplemental Table 2).

Simultaneous collection and processing of all samples for Cohort 2 (n=20) demonstrated 16
positive NP, 14 positive saliva, and 11 positive nasal samples. The PPA ranged from 69%-82%
and the OPA from 65%-75% for all pairwise comparisons (Table 2). Saliva sampling identified 2
positive patients who tested negative by NP, and inversely NP testing identified 4 positive
patients who tested negative by saliva (Supplemental Table 3). Nasal samples performed poorly
in this patient cohort.

Clinical sensitivity in Cohort 2 was calculated on the full cohort with clinical COVID-19 diagnosis
(n=20) showing: NP = 80%, saliva = 70%, and nasal = 55%. Eighteen patients (90%) were
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by at least one upper respiratory sample type. Therefore, analytical
sensitivity was calculated using this number as a denominator, showing: NP = 89%, saliva =
78%, and nasal = 61%.

Comparison of Cycle Threshold Results Across Sample Type
Cycle threshold (Ct) values for each anatomic sample site were compared in Cohorts 1A and 2,
in which all samples were analyzed on the same analytical platform. The interquartile ranges for
both N1 and N2 were largely overlapping (Figure 2A, Supplemental Figure 1A). In Cohort 1A,
the 2 discordant NP sample data points had Ct values of 36.6 and 38.4, near the assay limit of
detection. Cohort 2 had more discordant data points, consistent with the higher average Ct
value (lower relative viral load) observed in all anatomic sample types in this inpatient cohort
tested at later disease stages. Discordant data points in this cohort ranged as low as 26.2,
suggesting greater biologic variability in relative viral load between anatomic sites in patients at
later disease stages. Similar results were observed with relative viral load (Supplemental Figure
2).

Comparison of N1 (Figure 2B) and N2 (Supplemental Figure 1B) Ct values between sample
types from the same patient showed that saliva samples were heterogeneous in comparison to
both NP and nasal samples, generally showing low, non-significant correlation. The correlation
of NP vs. nasal Ct values was relatively tighter, with three of four comparisons trending towards
or reaching statistical significance.

samples demonstrated a smaller mean bias of -2.07 for N1 and -3.73 for N2, again showing
average lower Ct values for NP samples (Figure 3C, D). Heterogeneity around the mean bias
was observed with relatively large limits of agreement (95% confidence ranges). There was no

Correlation of Patient Symptoms with Test Results
Symptoms associated with COVID-19 were recorded from the medical record, scored, and used
to calculate P(COVID) according to the Menni et al. prediction model15. Adequate records to
calculate P(COVID) were available for 17 of 41 patients in Cohort 1A (outpatient), 16 of 19
patients in Cohort 1B (ED), and 19 of 20 patients in Cohort 2 (inpatient). Two patients in Cohort
1A had elevated P(COVID) scores (>0.5) but false negative saliva and nasal samples (Figure
4). Interestingly, both were being re-tested due to persistent symptoms at 2 and 4 weeks,
respectively, after onset of their laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. No clear pattern of symptoms
within Cohort 2 was evident in relation to the concordant or discordant test results from the three
anatomical sites (Figure 4). In Cohort 1B, discrepancies between elevated P(COVID) scores
and negative saliva tests (Supplemental Figure 3A) occurred in three patients without objective
fever or oxygen saturation abnormalities who had complete resolution of subjective symptoms in
<48 hours. We note that the P(COVID) score is heavily weighted toward loss of taste or smell, a
subjective symptom. Saliva and nasal samples demonstrated complete clinical agreement with
NP samples in patients with low P(COVID) scores (<0.5) who were tested when initial
symptoms developed; suggesting that saliva and nasal samples perform well in the population
screening setting.

Discussion
COVID-19 is a challenge to diagnose and treat at the individual patient level and to manage
through public health measures at the community level. Alternative sample types such as
patient-acquired saliva and anterior nasal samples are needed to facilitate high-volume testing
when there are shortages of qualified healthcare workers and necessary supplies to support
provider-acquired NP sampling. Our study sought to compare the performance of saliva and
anterior nasal samples with standard of care NP samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection in different
clinical settings. We observed variability in test results dependent on the clinical setting where

samples were collected and the heterogeneous pattern of clinical test routing that was an
uncontrolled variable in Cohort 1. Our results highlight some of the challenges facing diagnostic
characterization of COVID-19 and indicate good performance of saliva and anterior nasal
samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus when patients present for outpatient testing early in their
disease course.

Variability in laboratory test results is caused by both pre-analytical and analytical factors.
COVID-19 is a biologically heterogeneous infection: the anatomic distribution of active viral
replication and the severity of symptoms in comparison to viral load are variable between
different patients and during each individual’s disease course. These are important preanalytical factors impacting test performance on samples from different anatomical sites. A
recent systematic review and meta-analysis of saliva samples found that the pooled sensitivity
of saliva (83%) was similar to NP swab (84%) with diagnostic equivalency highest in the
ambulatory setting25. Additionally, recent pre-print data has been released supporting the
hypothesis that saliva viral load may be a strong clinical predictor of COVID-19 severity26. These
data overall support the important role saliva testing can play in assessing COVID-19.

We observed good PPA in Cohort 1A between the testing of banked saliva and nasal samples
compared to the prior clinical NP result. Analytical variation was minimized in this cohort, with all
samples tested using the same RT-PCR assay. Saliva and nasal samples showed complete
agreement, and only two patients (of 16 total positive) had false negative saliva and nasal
sample results compared to NP. These patients had previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
infections and were being re-tested due to persistent symptoms. The clinical NP sample for both
of these patients had Ct values consistent with viral loads below the 95% confidence limit of
detection for the clinical assay. Therefore, the false negative results in these cases could be due

study sample handling for this cohort. Considering only patients presenting within the first 10
days of symptom onset (n=14), saliva, nasal and NP samples had 100% PPA, suggesting that
all three anatomical sample sites perform well for initial diagnosis of COVID-19.

Biologic heterogeneity regarding persistence and anatomic distribution of viral replication later in
COVID-19 course was apparent in Cohort 2 (inpatient setting). An analytical advantage of
Cohort 2 was the prospective, parallel collection of all three sample types with simultaneous
handling and testing on the same platform. In this setting, no single anatomical site provided a
positive result for all 18 patients with at least one positive sample type. NP and saliva samples
performed better than nasal samples; however, the combination of an observed, patientcollected nasal and saliva sample together detected the same number of unique positive
patients (n=16) as did the provider-collected NP sample. Theoretically, combining patientcollected saliva and nasal samples into the same collection-stabilization buffer could improve
clinical sensitivity. Finally, there were 9 of 18 positive patients lacking SARS-CoV-2 detection in
at least one of the three anatomical sites, and there were 4 patients with only 1 of 3 sites testing
positive. This heterogeneity suggests that seeking a negative COVID-19 molecular test to guide
further patient management has limited clinical value, as a negative test from one anatomical
site does not rule out the presence of viral RNA in other sites from the same patient.

The data from Cohort 1B are difficult to interpret confidently. The unintended use of different
molecular tests for the clinical NP test was an analytical confounder. Though the limit of
detection for the commercial platforms (250-500 viral copies/mL) is lower than the CLIA-LDT
(1670 copies/mL), independent clinical quality assurance data from our laboratory (see
Supplemental Materials) comparing replicate testing of NP samples between platforms showed
PPA of 90-97%, a level of agreement aligned with published data using standard of care NP
samples27–29. This suggests additional pre-analytical variables impacted the poor concordance

observed in Cohort 1B. The clinical vignettes of discrepant results across anatomical sites and
testing platforms in Cohort 1B highlight the challenges of medical decision making with limited
knowledge of the associations between laboratory test data and the natural biology of SARSCoV-2 infection.

Our results highlight the importance of clinical judgement and integration of the patient’s medical
presentation when interpreting individual test results. Understanding how anatomic site, timing
of collection in disease course, handling and transport of the specimen, and analytical platform
can influence test results is crucially important to making informed medical decisions regarding
COVID-19 management30. Continued study of these factors in diverse clinical settings is
necessary for the medical field to improve the response to this global pandemic. Overall, our
findings support the conclusion that self-collected saliva testing is effective for COVID-19
detection, especially in early stages of disease progression.
