ABSTRACT

COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has resulted in over 800,000 deaths. Robust humoral antiviral immune responses have the potential to generate a diverse set of neutralizing antibodies
to eliminate viruses and protect against re-infection, transmission, and the evolution of
mutations that escape targeted therapeutics. CD73 is present on the majority of human B cells
and a subset of T cells where it plays a role in lymphocyte activation and migration. CD73 also
functions

as

an

ectoenzyme

that

converts

AMP

into

adenosine,

which

can

be

immunosuppressive. Here we report on CPI-006, a humanized FcgR binding-deficient IgG1 antiCD73 antibody that blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and directly activates CD73POS B cells,
inducing differentiation into plasmablasts, immunoglobulin class switching, and antibody
secretion independent of adenosine. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood from
advanced cancer patients receiving CPI-006 revealed evidence of B cell activation, clonal
expansion, and development of memory B cells. These immune effects suggested that CPI-006
may be effective at enhancing the magnitude, diversity, and duration of humoral and cellular
responses to viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. We have therefore initiated a Phase 1, single-dose,
dose-escalation trial in hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The objectives
of this trial are to evaluate the safety of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients and to determine effects
of CPI-006 on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and the development of memory B cell and
T cells. Ten patients have been enrolled in the trial receiving doses of 0.3 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg.
All evaluable patients had low pre-treatment serum levels of anti-viral antibodies to the SARSCoV-2 trimeric spike protein and its receptor binding domain, independent of the duration of
their COVID-19 related symptoms prior to enrollment. Anti-viral antibody responses were
induced 7 days after CPI-006 treatment and titers continued to rise past Day 56. Increases in
the frequency of memory B cells and effector/memory T cells were observed 28 days after
treatment. These preliminary results suggest that CPI-006 activates B cells and may enhance
and prolong anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in patients with COVID-19. This approach
may be useful for treating COVID-19 or as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of vaccines.

INTRODUCTION

Since its emergence in Hubei province, China, in December of 2019, the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has become a global health crisis.[1-3] There is an urgent need for therapies that
can improve survival, clinical outcomes, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive
care and prolonged hospitalization.[4] A growing understanding of the viral/host interactions
required for viral entry and replication has also informed the development of multiple
vaccines.[5] The SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein (TS) is a viral envelop glycoprotein which
contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike 1 (S1) subunit.[6] This RBD directly
interacts with N-terminal domain of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells to
initiate a sequence of events leading to efficient viral infection.[3, 7] Multiple recent publications
have demonstrated that antibodies that disrupt this interaction are effective at preventing viral
infection.[6, 8] This provides evidence that neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are
possible and may provide clinical benefit in patients with COVID-19 and protection from
disease in healthy subjects. Indeed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given
emergency use authorization for the use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) for the
treatment of COVID-19. Clinical studies with CCP suggest that higher titers of neutralizing
antibody provide superior clinical benefit to recipients.[9, 10] These findings support the value
of anti-viral antibodies in eradicating viral infection in patients, lessening disease severity, and
potentially reducing transmission.
CD73 is an emerging cancer immunotherapy target that was initially found to be important for
lymphocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[11, 12] CD73 is expressed on subsets of human
CD4POS and CD8POS T cells, germinal center follicular dendritic cells, and both na√Øve and class
switched memory B cells.[12-14] A role for CD73 in B cell maturation has been proposed as
reduced CD73 expression on B cells from patients with common variable immunodeficiency
(CVID) correlates with an inability to produce IgG. [15, 16] Like many glycosyl
phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules, CD73 has been shown to transmit activation
signals when ligated by antibodies, although a physiologic ligand for CD73 has not been
identified.[11, 12] CD73 also functions as an ectonucleotidase that hydrolyzes adenosine
monophosphate (AMP) into adenosine.[17]

Here, we describe the generation and characterization of CPI-006, an IgG1k humanized FcgR
binding-deficient anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that activates CD73POS B cells. In vitro,
CPI-006 induces the increased expression of markers associated with B cell maturation and
antigen presentation, morphologic transformation to plasmablasts, and increased secretion of
IgM and IgG. Biomarker studies in an ongoing Phase 1 cancer clinical trial revealed that CPI006 causes a rapid and transient redistribution of circulating B cells that return to circulation
enriched in a memory B cell phenotype.[18] Molecular studies of the B cell receptor (BCR)
repertoire in treated patients suggests that CPI-006 stimulates the generation and expansion
of novel B cell clones. These findings provided the rationale to examine CPI-006 as an
immunotherapy for COVID-19 with the aim of enhancing anti-viral immune responses. The
results of this trial to date suggest that the immunomodulatory properties of CPI-006 may be
applied for the treatment of COVID-19 and also potentially utilized in combination with vaccines
to induce immunity in healthy subjects.
RESULTS

CPI-006 Inhibits CD73 Enzyme Function and Reverses Adenosine-Mediate Immunosuppression
CPI-006 is a humanized anti-CD73 IgG1k antibody engineered with an N297Q mutation in CH2
of the heavy chain to eliminate Fc effector functions such as the ability to fix complement and
initiate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC, Supplemental Figure 1A). CPI-006
binds human CD73 with a KD of 200 pM measured using bio-layer interferometry (Supplemental
Figure 1B). The ability of this antibody to inhibit the enzymatic activity of cellular CD73 was
evaluated by directly measuring free phosphate levels generated upon conversion of AMP to
adenosine. CPI-006 inhibited CD73 activity to baseline levels that were established using the
CRISPR CD73 knockout cell line and comparison to treatment with saturating amounts of APCP
(adenosine 5‚Äô-(a,b-methylene) diphosphate), a small molecule inhibitor of CD73 enzymatic
activity (Figure 1A). In contrast, MEDI9447, another anti-CD73 antibody that binds a nonoverlapping epitope, only partially reduced CD73 activity.[19] CPI-006 also eliminated the
enzymatic activity of CD73 expressed on primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) while MEDI9447 demonstrated a partial effect on enzymatic activity (Figure 1B).
Collectively, these data show that CPI-006 and MEDI9447 inhibit catalytic activity of cellular
CD73 expressed by tumor cells and lymphocytes, but only CPI-006 completely abolishes CD73
enzymatic activity.

To model the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine on T cells, human PBMCs were obtained
from healthy donors and cultured under T cell activating conditions. Addition of AMP resulted
in decreased T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Addition of CPI-006 restored T cell
proliferation in all donors tested, consistent with the antibody preventing conversion of AMP
into immunosuppressive adenosine (Figures 1C). MEDI9447 restored T cell proliferation in a
subset of donors but did not reach the magnitude of the CPI-006 response (Figures 1C).
Interferon-gamma (IFNg) production was evaluated as an additional readout for T cell response
and similar results were observed (Figures 1D). These data demonstrate that antibodymediated inhibition of CD73 activity blocks the suppressive effects of adenosine on T cell
proliferation and cytokine secretion.
CPI-006 Directly Activates Human B cells in vitro
CD73 is expressed on subsets of human hematopoietic cells and had previously been
implicated to play a role in lymphocyte activation and adhesion [12, 13, 20, 21]. We performed
a flow cytometry-based screen to identify differentially expressed cell surface markers on
immune cells following in vitro treatment with CPI-006. CPI-006 strikingly activated B
lymphocytes, resulting in the upregulation of activation markers (CD69 and CD83) and antigen
presentation machinery (CD86 and MHC-II) to similar levels achieved with the positive control
of BCR crosslinking via anti-IgM (Figure 2A). CPI-006 mediated B cell activation also resulted in
increased cell surface expression of CD27, IgG, CD38, and CD138, all markers consistent with
induction of B cell maturation (Figure 2B). CPI-006 induced activation was dose-dependent with
concentrations of 1 ¬µg/mL achieving near maximal induction of CD69 in vitro (Figure 2C). B
cell activation has not previously been described in relation to CD73 signaling and is seemingly
unique to CPI-006, as both MEDI9447 and clone AD2, two anti-CD73 antibodies that do not
cross-block CPI-006, fail to induce activation (Figure 2C). Na√Øve B cells stimulated with CPI-006
in vitro underwent morphological changes consistent with differentiation into plasmablasts
(Figure 2D). CPI-006 mediated B cell activation was restricted to CD73POS B cells and required
bivalent binding as CPI-006 immunoglobulin Fab fragments had minimal effect on expression
levels of CD69 (Figure 2E). CPI-006 induction of CD69 was blocked with ibrutinib, a covalent
BTK inhibitor (Figure 2F), demonstrating that CPI-006 directly activates B lymphocytes by
invoking canonical B cell signaling pathways. B cell activation was not a consequence of the
concentration of extracellular adenosine as addition of NECA (5‚Ä≤-(N-Ethylcarboxamido)

adenosine), a potent and stable analogue of adenosine, did not block the induction of
activation markers by CPI-006 (Figure 2G).[22]
To assess functional consequences of B cell activation with CPI-006, we first measured the
concentration of IgG and IgM secreted by healthy donor PBMCs into the culture supernatant
six days after in vitro treatment. Addition of CPI-006 resulted in a 3-fold increase in IgM and
IgGl levels (IgGk not measured) relative to an isotype control, demonstrating that CPI-006
stimulates antibody secretion and possibly class switching to IgG (Figure 3A). CPI-006 also
induced production of B cell cytokines such as CCL3, CCL4, CCL2, and CCL22 (Figure 3B-3E),
but did not induce IFNg, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, or TNFa from healthy donor PBMCs (data not shown).
CPI-006 would therefore not be expected to increase the potential for inflammatory cytokine
release reported in some COVID-19 patients. [23-25] Collectively, these experiments
demonstrate that CPI-006 activates B lymphocytes, resulting in morphological and
immunological changes consistent with B cell differentiation and antibody production.
Furthermore, this property is unique to CPI-006 and is independent of adenosine-modulatory
activity.
Immunologic Effects of CPI-006 in a Phase 1 Trial in Advanced Cancer Patients
CPI-006 is being evaluated as an immunotherapy for cancer in an ongoing phase 1 study
(NCT03454451). In this dose escalation, repeat dose (21-day cycle) study, we observed
dramatic decreases in circulating CD73POS B cells at all CPI-006 dose levels (1-24 mg/kg), 30
minutes after antibody infusion (Figure 4A). CPI-006 does not induce B cell death or initiate
ADCC (Supplemental Figure 1A) so this result is most likely due to the redistribution of activated
B cells into lymphoid tissues. B cells returned to circulation at levels similar to baseline by day
21. Returning B cells were enriched in CD27POS IgDNEG class switched memory B cells in the
majority of subjects receiving ‚â• 3 mg/kg CPI-006 (Figure 4B). Memory B cells are essential for
both acute and long-term immunity as they have undergone immunoglobulin rearrangement
and somatic hypermutation in order to produce high affinity, antigen-specific antibody upon
exposure to antigen. BCR repertoire analysis in a subset of patients revealed the emergence of
novel B cell clones that were not present in the peripheral blood prior to treatment (Figure 4C).
These new B cell clones were limited to 2-40 clones per patient and appeared with frequencies
as high as 1:100 B cells, consistent with a robust clonal expansion following an antigen-specific
response (Figure 4C). The cognate antigens recognized by these new B cell clones are currently

under characterization. Representative CPI-006 treated patients (n=10) with robust
diversification of BCR repertoire demonstrate unaltered antigen-specific IgG response against
5 common viruses (Mumps, CMV, Rubella, Measles, HSV1) at 21 days post treatment compared
to baseline. This result demonstrates that CPI-006 does not simply induce polyclonal B cell
activation and implies a requirement for concomitant antigen exposure in order for CPI-006 to
induce an antigen-specific response (Supplemental Figure 2).
Immunotherapy of COVID-19 with CPI-006.
Clinical Study Design
CPI-006-002 is a Phase 1 open label, dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and
immunologic effects of a single dose of CPI-006 as immunotherapy for hospitalized patients
with mild to moderately severe COVID-19 (NCT04464395). SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed
by RT-qPCR testing of nasal swabs and eligible patients must have blood oxygen saturation of
at least 92% on ‚â§5L/min supplemental oxygen. Five patients per cohort receive doses of 0.3
mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 5.0 mg/kg delivered by intravenous infusion over 10-30
minutes. Patients are allowed to receive standard care for COVID-19, including remdesivir and
steroids. Use of CCP or passively administered monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were
not permitted. Safety and other disease assessments along with PBMC and serum collection
are conducted at 7, 14, and 28 days, and at 2 months, 3 months and 6 months after receiving
CPI-006.
Patient Characteristics and Safety
Five patients have been treated in the 0.3 mg/kg and five in the 1.0 mg/kg cohorts (Table 1).
The median age was 64 years (range 28-76) and all had comorbidities including diabetes (4),
hypertension (2), obesity (7,) and/or cancer (2). The median duration from presentation of
symptoms (POS) to CPI-006 administration was 8 days (range 1-21 days). No infusion related
reactions or other treatment related adverse events have been observed.

All patients

recovered with improvement of inflammatory markers and symptoms and were discharged at a
median of 4 days after hospitalization (Table 1).

IgG and IgM antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 TS and/or RBD rapidly increased in 8/8
evaluable patients within 7 days of a single infusion of low doses of CPI-006 (Figure 5A, 5B).
One patient did not have a pre-treatment sample available, but had a sample collected 24
hours after CPI-006 administration and this sample exhibited a high antibody titer. Similar
results were observed in anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgA titers (data not shown). No correlation between
time after POS and pre-treatment serum antibody levels has been observed as 9/9 evaluable
patients had low pre-treatment titers despite relatively long durations of symptoms.

For

example, one patient had low titers at 21 days after onset of symptoms, but produced IgG and
IgM titers rapidly rising to >100,000 and extending 28 days after administration of CPI-006,
equivalent to 49 days POS. A corresponding increase in neutralizing antibody levels, measured
by the ability to block recombinant RBD binding to human ACE2, was also observed (Figure
5C). Results in this assay have been shown by others to correlate with results in the live viral
plaque reduction neutralization assay test (PRNTs).[26] Continually increasing IgG and IgM
levels to viral TS or RBD antigens and neutralization antibodies were observed out to 28 days
post treatment. It appears that prolonged high titer humoral response is possible as one patient
has escalating levels out to 56 days. Antibody levels reached higher titers compared to
convalescent sera from recovered patients with more favorable clinical characteristics
(convalescent sera collected at 4-6 weeks POS, no comorbidities, and median age of 40) (Figure
6A-6C). Immunophenotyping of PBMCs at baseline and 14- or 28-days after treatment provided
preliminary evidence that CPI-006 increased the frequency of memory B cells in two of two
evaluated patients treated with 0.3 mg/kg (Figure 7A). An increased frequency of
memory/effector CD4POS and CD8POS T cells was also observed (Figure 7B-7C) in three out of
three evaluated patients. PBMCs stimulated with peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2
membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), or spike (S) produced Th1 cytokines such as IFNg and IL-2
following CPI-006 treatment in one patient evaluated thus far (Figure 7D-7E).
DISCUSSION

CPI-006 is a humanized FcgR binding-deficient anti-CD73 mAb that directly activates CD73POS
B cells, thereby inducing their trafficking to lymphoid tissues and promoting antibody
production and differentiation into memory B cells. CPI-006 induces markers of B cell activation
(CD69), maturation (CD138, CD28), and antigen presentation (CD86, CD83, MHC-II) in vitro
along with a corresponding morphologic transformation into antibody secreting plasmablasts.

Studies in cancer patients demonstrated diversification of the BCR repertoire by stimulating the
emergence and expansion of novel B cell clones. These findings indicate that CPI-006 can
activate CD73POS B cells to elicit antigen specific humoral and memory responses that display
functional hallmarks associated with protective immunity. These effects are independent of
CD73 enzymatic activity as addition of adenosine analogs or blockade of CD73 enzymatic
activity alone has no effect on B cell activation in vitro. To our knowledge, CPI-006 is the only
anti-CD73 antibody or small molecule inhibitor in development with the ability to directly
activate B or T cells.
CD73 was originally characterized as a costimulatory molecule for T cells, but our results
demonstrate that CPI-006 predominantly activates B cells.[11] Human CD73 is expressed on
IgDPOSIgMDIM/NEG na√Øve B cells, and CD27POS memory B cells expressing IgG or IgA.[14] CPI-006
induces the expression of CD69, an activation marker that negatively regulates S1PR1 function,
resulting in the prolonged retention of activated B cells in lymphoid organs and thymus.[27]
This increased lymphoid residence time provides time to complete B cell activation and interact
with CD4POS T follicular helper cells to shape downstream immune responses. While B cell
activation with CPI-006 is independent of adenosine blockade in vitro, the CD73 enzymatic
blockade may be complementary in vivo as adenosine has been shown to restrict lymphocyte
migration into lymph nodes in preclinical animal models.[28] Additional studies will clarify if this
temporary sequestration in lymph tissues is the dominant mechanism by which CPI-006
diversifies the BCR repertoire and promotes the development memory B and T cells.
This study demonstrates that antibody titers to TS and RBD with neutralizing activity toward
RBD increase within 7 days in patients treated with a single, low dose of CPI-006. The single,
low doses evaluated in our study thus far are noteworthy as the maximal concentrations of CPI006 in plasma are modeled to exceed the 1 ¬µg/ml threshold needed for maximal B cell
activation yet low enough to be rapidly cleared. Although CPI-006 was delivered intravenously
in this study, the effects seen with low doses indicate that alternative routes of delivery such as
subcutaneous or intramuscular administration are feasible.
Most patients with COVID-19 become seropositive for IgG/IgM/IgA within 2-3 weeks following
onset of symptoms.[29] However, all of the patients on this trial had low levels of anti-SARSCoV2 antibodies at the time of hospitalization despite a wide range of duration of prior
symptoms from 1-21 days. The lack of response in these patients may be related to host factors

reducing the ability to mount a humoral response or other unknown immunosuppressive effects
of viral infection. CPI-006 may overcome this apparent immunodeficiency as we observed
robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses induced by CPI-006 in patients with long POS and
low pre-treatment titers. The kinetics following seroconversion are still being clarified, but
others have reported that antibody titers in COVID-19 patients plateau approximately 6 days
after seroconversion before steadily declining in the following weeks (IgM/IgA) to months
(IgG).[29] Our preliminary results show that anti-SARS-CoV2 titers continue to rise without
plateauing in the weeks following treatment, possibly hinting at a more robust and durable
humoral response that would theoretically improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
These effects may also serve to reduce viral transmission and expand the pool of qualified
convalescent plasma donors.
Temporary protection against SARS-CoV-2 can be imparted by circulating neutralizing
antibodies, but the key to long term immunity lies in the production of antigen-specific memory
B and T cells capable of recognizing and eliminating any potential re-infection. Indeed, CD4POS
and CD8POS T cells able to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 were detected in patients 6 years after
recovering from the original 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak.[30] The increased frequency in memory
B cells we observed following CPI-006 treatment in cancer patients has thus far been measured
in a very limited number of COVID-19 patients. Additional studies are underway to evaluate the
antigen specificity of these memory B cells. An increase in the frequency of memory/effector T
cells were also observed. Serial assessments of these populations will be required to determine
the durability of immunological memory and whether a dose response emerges as we continue
to escalate the CPI-006 dose. We note that imbalanced B and T cell responses have been
reported in COVID-19 patients, including protective T cell responses without detectable
seroconversion and, conversely, impaired CD4POS T cell responses in critically ill patients with
high IgG antibody titers. B cell recruitment and responses in peri-tumoral tertiary lymphoid
structures has been associated with response to immunotherapy; thus, it‚Äôs tempting to
speculate that CPI-006 could help restore coordinated B and T cell responses in COVID-19
patients. [31-33]
Multiple viral and mRNA-based vaccines in development have demonstrated the potential to
induce humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in vaccinated normal
subjects.[34, 35] While encouraging, rapidly diminishing antibody titers approximately two
weeks after vaccination have necessitated a second booster vaccination in some instances.[34]

CPI-006 is being developed as a therapeutic, but it is important to note that it could also be
used as a vaccine adjuvant to boost the titer, diversity, and duration of antibody responses and
potentiate the development of long term immunity by generating memory B and effector T
cells. This combination approach may be useful to enable successful immunization with a single
vaccination and particularly effective in vulnerable populations such as immunosuppressed and
elderly patients who do not typically respond well to vaccines.
The use of CPI-006 in COVID-19 patients has several advantages over other therapeutic
approaches. CPI-006 may stimulate enhanced production of anti-viral antibodies in SARS-CoV2 infected patients to shorten both the disease duration and time to viral clearance. Such
antibody responses are also likely to be polyclonal, generating antibodies reacting with multiple
viral antigenic determinants, not only on TS but other viral proteins as well, that would minimize
the probability of developing resistance through natural selection of epitope loss variants. The
increase in memory B and T cells can also provide longer lasting immunity and prevention of
re-infection and transmission. Other approaches such as anti-viral drugs or passively
administered monoclonal antibodies can be compromised by the evolution of viral mutations
able to escape therapeutic targeting. Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will also
require significant quantities of infused immunoglobulin(s) and may need repeated infusions in
order to maintain concentrations required for passive immunity. In contrast, low doses of CPI006 have the potential to be immediately deployed in order to induce a diverse repertoire of
high titer anti-viral antibodies in patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or, potentially, other
infectious disease. We note that diversifying the repertoire of antigen specific B cells would also
facilitate the development of a broader cocktail of therapeutic mAbs when needed as these
cells can be directly isolated, sequenced, and screened for antibodies targeting unique viral
epitopes.[36]
Absent a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we are currently unable to
conclude that the effects observed thus far in treated COVID-19 patients are directly
attributable to CPI-006. Our current results demonstrate an atypically robust and durable
antibody response following CPI-006 treatment, but we cannot exclude the possibility that
these responses would have developed naturally. Moreover, multiple confounding factors
including the variability in patient responses, clinical setting, and lack of standardized testing
methods complicate comparisons to other therapeutics in development. Nonetheless, these
encouraging early results are in line with our hypothesized biological mechanism and we remain

cautiously optimistic that longitudinal assessments of neutralizing antibody titers and B and T
cell functional assays will clarify the contribution of CPI-006 to humoral and cellular immune
responses. We encourage the reader to consider the results presented here as a work in
progress that we intend to update regularly as additional safety, efficacy, and biomarker data
become available.
METHODS

See Supplemental Methods for additional details.
Antibodies
CPI-006 was engineered by isolating VH and VL regions from the parental hybridoma generated
by immunizing mice with human CD73 and screening for inhibition of CD73 activity.
Humanization was performed by inserting CDRs isolated from the hybridoma into a human
framework and the antibody was expressed as a human kappa/IgG1 antibody with the N297Q
mutation introduced into the CH2 region to eliminate FcgR binding. MEDI9447 was cloned
using the VH and VL chain sequences published in WO 2016/075099 AI application patent and
was expressed as a human lambda/IgG1-TM antibody. Both antibodies were expressed in Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified by Protein A chromatography (HiTrap Protein
A, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). For flow cytometry analysis, antibodies were labeled with
AlexaFluor 647 (Life Technologies). Human IgG1 isotype control used for in vitro and vivo
studies was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and BioXCell, respectively. Fab fragments were
prepared using the Pierce Fab Preparation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Anti-CD73 antibody
clone AD2 was purchased from Abcam.
Affinity measurements
Binding experiments were performed on Octet HTX at 25¬∞C. Purified antibodies (2 ¬µg/mL) were
loaded onto Anti-Human IgG Fc Capture biosensors. Loaded sensors were dipped into a
threefold dilution series of antigen (starting at 300 nM). Kinetic constants were calculated using
a monovalent (1:1) binding model.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA assays
ELISA was performed to measure the IgG, IgM, IgA antibody titer to the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the spike protein and full-length spike trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Purified
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD and full-length spike protein were obtained from LakePharma.

Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with RBD or spike protein (2 ¬µg/mL in PBS) overnight at 4¬∞C
then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr. at room temperature (RT) after three washes with
PBST. Serial dilutions of serum were prepared in PBST containing 1% BSA, then dispensed to
the wells of the coated microtiter plate and incubated for 2 hr at RT. After three washes, the
bound antibody was detected using anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
secondary antibody (1:3000, Sigma-Aldrich, A0170) or anti-human IgM HPR secondary antibody
(1:3000, Sigma-Aldrich, A0420), or anti-human IgA HRP secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT. After
three washes, the reaction was developed by the addition of the substrate o-phenylenediamine
dihydrochloride (SigmaFast OPD) and stopped by HCl (2M). The absorbance at 490 nm
(OD490) was measured using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Recovered COVID-19
patient serum was obtained from Sanguine Biosciences from recovered patients confirmed to
have had a COVID-19 PCR+ result. All serum samples were treated to inactivate infectious virus
by incubation at 56¬∞C for 30 mins. Healthy volunteer serum samples obtained from Stanford
Blood Center during 2018 served as negative control. The titer cutoff value at OD490 is the
mean plus 3 standard deviations of the negative controls. The endpoint titer is reported as the
highest dilution of at least two before the OD490 decreases below the cut-off value. Data were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.
RBD-ACE2 blocking assay
A MaxiSORP ELISA plate (Nunc) was pre-coated with human ACE2 protein (GenScript) at 100
ng per well in 50 ŒºL of 100 mM carbonate‚Äìbicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4
¬∞C, followed by blocking with OptEIA assay diluent (BD). Human sera were prepared using a
2.5-fold serial dilution starting at 1:5. The sera was diluted a further 2-fold by addition of an
equal volume of HRP‚Äìconjugated RBD (Genscript) and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 37
¬∞C in a final volume of 150 ŒºL. The mixture (100 ŒºL) was transferred to the wells of the precoated
ELISA plate and incubated for 15 min at 37 ¬∞C. Unbound HRP-RBD was removed by washing
the plate four times with 260 ¬µL of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20. Bound antigen
was

tetramethylbenzidine followed by incubation for 20 min at 22 ¬∞C. The reaction was quenched
by addition of 50 ¬µL of 3 N HCl and the absorbance at 450 nm read using an EnVision plate
reader (PerkinElmer). ID50 values were obtained by fitting the response-normalized data to a
four-parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 for Windows, GraphPad
Software, San Diego, California USA.

Antigen specific T cell peptivator assay
Cryopreserved PBMCs from pre-2020 control donors or CPI-006 treated COVID-19 patients
were thawed, washed, and incubated in RPMI 1640 (ATCC, Catalog #30-2001) plus 5% human
serum (Sigma, Catalog #H4522-100ML) with Pen/Strep (Gibco, Catalog#15140122) for 24
hours with 600 nM SARS-CoV-2 peptides including S peptide (Miltenyi Biotec 130-126-700), M
peptide (Miltenyi Biotec, Catalog #130-126-702), N peptide (Miltenyi Biotec, Catalog #130126-698) or control HIV peptides (JPT, Catalog #PM-HIV-CONB). Culture supernatants were
collected and cytokines were assayed according to manufacturer‚Äôs protocol using the V-PLEX
Proinflammatory Panel 1 Human Kit (MSD, Catalog #15049D)
Immunophenotyping of CPI-006 treated patient PBMCs
PBMCs from COVID-19 patients were isolated within 24hr of blood collection and
cryopreserved for flow cytometry. Expression of cell surface markers associated with B and T
cell activation were assessed by flow cytometry using Fc blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotech,
Catalog #130-059-901) and antibodies directed to CD19 BV421 (Clone HIB19; BD Biosciences,
Cat #562440), CD38 BV510 (Clone HB-7; BioLegend, Cat #356612), IgD FITC (Clone IA6-2; BD
Biosciences, Cat #555778), CD73 PE (Clone AD2; BD Biosciences, Cat #550257), Mouse antihuman PD-1 PerCP 5.5 (clone EH12.1, BD Biosciences, Catalog #561273), CD3 PE-Cy7 (Clone
UCHT1; BioLegend, Cat #300420), CD27 APC (Clone L128; BD Biosciences, Cat #337169),
Mouse anti-human CD45RA APC-Fire 750 (clone HI100, BioLegend, Catalog #304152), Mouse
anti-human CD8 BVD650 (clone SK1, BD Biosciences, Catalog #565289), Mouse anti-human
CD4 PE-CF594 (clone SK3, BD Biosciences, Catalog #566914), Rat anti-human CXCR5 APCR700 (clone RF8B2, BD Biosciences, Catalog #565191). Cryopreserved PBMCs from COVID-19
patients were analyzed at Corvus Pharmaceuticals using a CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter). Fresh
blood from cancer patients were analyzed at ICON using the same antibody clones. Flow data
was analyzed using FlowJo v10.7.
B cell receptor analysis
Sequencing of the CDR3 regions of human variable chains was performed using the
immunoSEQ¬Æ BCR Assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Genomic DNA was
extracted from PBMCs and was amplified in a bias-controlled multiplex PCR, followed by highthroughput sequencing and the abundance of each unique BCR region was quantified.[37-39]

Figure 1: CPI-006 blocks CD73 enzymatic activity and restores T cell proliferation and cytokine
production in an AMP-mediated immunosuppressive environment.
A) CD73 catalytic activity was measured with MDA-MB-231 cells or MDA-MB-231 CD73 CRISPR
cells in the presence of CPI-006, MEDI9447, or 1 mM APCP by adding 250 ŒºM AMP and
measuring phosphate levels in the cell culture supernatant. B) Human PBMCs were incubated
with AMP in the presence of CPI-006, MEDI9447, or isotype control antibody at the saturating
concentration of 300 nM. After 4 hours of incubation, the AMP remaining in the supernatant
was quantified using the CellTiterGlo assay as described in the Methods. Percentage of
inhibition was plotted. Data represent 9 individual donors and error bars represent mean ¬± SD.
