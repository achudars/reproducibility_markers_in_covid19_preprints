Key Messages

• This study evaluated mortality trends in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, reporting an

excess of 47,490 (95% empirical confidence intervals: 43,984 to 50,362) deaths in the period
15 February – 15 May 2020, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%)
from the expected mortality.
• There is a strong geographical pattern, with 71.0% of the estimated excess deaths occurring in

just three northern regions (Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna), and few provinces
showing increases in mortality up to 800% during the peak of the pandemic.
• The impact was slightly higher is men compared to women, with 24,655 and 23,125 excess

deaths respectively, and varied by age, with higher mortality in the group 70-79 years old and
evidence of a lower but measurable risk even in people less than 60.

Introduction
The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and
quickly affected most of the countries worldwide in the first months of 2020. The infection causes
COVID-19 disease, a severe acute respiratory syndrome that can lead to hospitalization and
eventually death.1,2 As of 6th of July 2020, almost 11.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported,
resulting in 535,027 official deaths.3
Italy has been one of the worst affected countries. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection not
originating in China was reported on the 20th of February in the province of Lodi, and the disease
quickly spread across the North of the country.4 The number of reported cases with a validated
diagnostic test rose to 1,128 by the end of the month, and peaked on 21st of March with 6,557 cases
per day.4
A series of containment policies, both at national and local level, were implemented since the start
of the outbreak. The Italian Government declared the quarantine of 11 municipalities in Northern
Italy on the 21st of February, which was then extended to the entire region of Lombardy on the 8th of
March, and finally to the whole country the next day. Strict lockdown measures were implemented
thereafter, including social distancing, travel restrictions, closure of all non-essential businesses and
industries, and stay-at-home orders.5 Most of the strictest measures were not released until early
May.
The pandemic put enormous pressure on the health system, and it was particularly severe in
Lombardy and few other selected provinces in other northern regions, were hospitals were
overwhelmed. Emergency and intensive care units (ICU) focused almost exclusively on COVID-19
patients, with admissions for other causes substantially reduced, while general practice and
outpatients activities were in many cases halted to prevent the transmission of the virus.6,7 The first
fatality officially attributed to COVID-19 in Italy occurred in Veneto on the 21st of February. The
number of deaths then started rising, and by the 15th of May 31,610 deaths related to COVID-19
were reported.4
Previous assessment on the health impact focused on excess in all-cause mortality,8-10 an indicator
that offers a quantification of the overall burden of the disease, accounting for both direct and
indirect effects.11 However, these analyses are limited to urban areas or used data aggregated by
region, and they adopted relatively simple designs based on pre-post comparisons that do not
account for temporal trends and variation in other risk factors such as weather.
In this contribution, we performed an analysis of the excess mortality during the first month of the
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group, and

period of the outbreak. The assessment is based on a new dataset released by ISTAT with better
coverage, and it benefits from the application of a novel two-stage interrupted time series design
and flexible statistical methods. This study can therefore offer a comprehensive overview of the
mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.

Methods
Data

The analysis is based on the database released by ISTAT on 18/06/2020,12 which provides number of
daily deaths stratified by sex and age groups for 7,904 municipalities in 107 provinces and 20 regions
of Italy within the period 01/01/2015 to 15/05/2020 (Table 1). The database includes complete daily
counts for 2015-2019, and early-release data for the four and a half months of 2020 for 7,270
municipalities (92% of the total) for which linkage with death registration was up to date. The
mortality counts were aggregated by province in sex and age-specific daily time series, and linked
with daily mean temperature data at the population-weighted centroid of the province from the
ERA-5 reanalysis dataset on the Copernicus climate data store,13 and weekly incidence of influenza
cases at regional level determined by laboratory tests.14

Two-stage analysis

The statistical analysis was performed by applying a two-stage interrupted time series model to
quantify the time-varying excess risk for mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak compared with the
pre-outbreak period, accounting for temporal trends and variation in other risk factors. In the first
stage, at province level, we applied a quasi-Poisson time series regression model with smooth spline
functions for time variables and observed predictors.15 Specifically, we included a linear term for
time for the long-term trend, a cyclic cubic B-spline with three equally-spaced knots for day of the
year to model seasonality, and indicators for day of the week to take into account weekly variation
in mortality. The excess risk in mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak was defined through a
constrained quadratic B-spline with four equally-spaced knots for the days from 01/02/2020 to
15/05/2020 (outbreak period). This function constraints the excess risk to start from null at the
beginning of February, and then allows it to vary flexibly until the end of the study period. Potential
differences in the underlying mortality risk due to non-optimal weather between the pre-outbreak
and outbreak periods where controlled by including a term for mean daily temperature. This was
defined through a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) over 0-21 lag days,16 using a cross-basis
parameterization defined in previous studies.17 It was decided not to control for influenza in the

main model, as laboratory testing could be affected by the pandemic, thus resulting in artificial
reduction in flu incidence. This choice was tested in a sensitivity analysis, where we controlled for
the effect of influenza using a two-week moving average of the reconstructed daily incidence.
The province-specific coefficients of the function defining the excess risk were then pooled in the
second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis,18 and best linear unbiased predictions
for each of the 107 provinces were extracted. This approach allows borrowing strengths in the
estimates across provinces, while at the same time modelling flexible associations of multiparameter functions.19

Quantification of excess mortality

The model was performed on the province-specific aggregated series composed by the 7,270
municipalities with full data, and the estimates were used to compute the relative risk (RR)
representing the excess in each province for each day of the outbreak period. We then
reconstructed the complete mortality series for all the municipalities by using the data in the period
2015-2019 to compute, in each province, the proportion of deaths occurring in municipalities with
full data, and then applying the same proportion to the four months of 2020. The daily number of
excess deaths was computed as (RR-1)/RR*n, where n is the daily number of deaths, and aggregated
by week during the outbreak period (from the 1st of February), and then in total for the period with
reported COVID-19 mortality (from the 15th of February). Excess number and fraction of deaths were
then computed for each province, region, area (North, Central, South, and Islands) and for the whole
Italy. We computed empirical confidence intervals (eCI) at 95% by Monte Carlo simulation of the
coefficients of the quadratic B-spline modelling the excess risk, assuming a multivariate normal
distribution using the point estimates and (co)variance matrix. Sex and age-specific models were run
separately to compute the excess across sub-groups of the population.

are provided in the Section Availability of data and materials below.

Results
In the three months from 15th of February to 15th of May 2020, approximately 208,320 deaths were
registered in Italy, with an estimated increase of 47,490 (95%eCI: 43,984 to 50,362) from the
expected baseline number when accounting for temporal trends and differences in temperature
distribution (Table 2). This figure corresponds to a percentage excess of 29.5% (95%eCI: 26.8 to
31.9%). As previously reported, the excess shows a strong geographical pattern, with an extremely

high rise in the number of deaths in the northern regions. Lombardy alone experienced a staggering
25,782 excess deaths, and together with two other northern regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna)
accounts for 71.0% of all the excess mortality estimated in Italy. The maps in Figure 1 provides a
better representation of the geographical distribution, showing a percentage increase in deaths that
reaches almost 400% in few selected northern provinces. The excess mortality is comparatively
milder in Central Italy, and considerably smaller or absent in the South and the islands, although
with a patchy distribution and isolated spots such as in the provinces of Pesaro-Urbino (East coast)
and Crotone (the ‘bottom of the foot’ in the South).
Differently from what reported during the outbreak, the increase in mortality is only slightly higher
in men compared to women, with a total of 24,655 and 23,125, corresponding to percentage
increases of 32.1% (95%eCI: 28.6 to 34.8%) and 27.7% (95%eCI: 24.5 to 30.0%), respectively (Table
2). Figure 2 reports the results stratified by age and sex, indicating a lower excess mortality in
women in the age groups between 60 and 89, but almost identical to males in younger and older
people. Excess mortality was substantially lower in people less than 60 years old, although this group
still shows a percentage excess of 10.2% (95%eCI: -3.5 to 23.2%) in the outbreak period. The maps in
Figure 1 suggests a similar geographical distribution of the excess deaths across sex and age groups.
Figure 3 shows the trend in relative risk of mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak period by sex,
age group, and area. The graphs suggest that the risk started increasing above the baseline at the
beginning of March, and that the peak was reached at the end of the same month, almost 20 days
after the implementation of lockdown measures. Given the uneven geographical distribution of the
risk, with the densely populated provinces of the North mostly affected, this increased risks
translates into a larger total excess in mortality, which reached 78.7% (95%eCI: 70.6 to 85.5%) above
the baseline in the week of 18-24 March (figures reported in the Online Appendix). The risk then
decreased during April, with evidence of an excess mortality until at least the first week of May. The
temporal distribution of risk is similar across sex and age groups (top and middle panels), with an
indication of a slight delayed peak for women and very elderly (90 years old and older). The relative
risk for the less than 60 age group reaches a lower peak just above 1.2, and it returns to the baseline
level by mid-April. Consistently with what discussed above, the analysis by geographical area
(bottom panel) suggests a very high mortality risk in the North, that across the region is more than
twice at the peak (RR above 2.0), while other areas show milder increases and earlier peaks. Some
provinces showed staggering increases, with the percentage excess in Bergamo reaching 858.7%
(95%eCI: 771.9 to 969.5%) in the week 18-24 March (see Online Appendix). There is some indication
of an RR lower than 1 in the late stage of the epidemics in Central and Southern Italy, which can
suggest an ‘harvesting effect’ with part of the deaths only anticipated by few weeks.20

Controlling for the additional effect of influenza has little impact, with an estimated excess of 48,569
compared to 47,490 in the main model.
The full set of results, including number and fraction of excess deaths (with 95%eCI) by geographical
aggregation (provinces, region, and full country), sex, age groups, and period (15th of February - 15th
of May 2020, and then by week starting from the 1st of February) is provided in the Online Appendix.

Conclusions
This study offers a detailed assessment of mortality for all causes in Italy during the COVID-19
pandemic wave in the first months of 2020. The estimate of an excess of 47,490 deaths is far higher
than the number of 31,610 deaths officially recorded as related to COVID-19 in the same months.
The increased mortality risk shows a strong geographical pattern, with few northern provinces
carrying the majority of excess deaths. Stratified analyses indicate differences in the impact by sex
and age, while the analysis of the trend shows that excess mortality peaked the end of March.
The most striking result of the analysis is the strong north-to-south geographical gradient in the
impact of COVID-19 in Italy, consistent with previous studies from Italy.8-10 The vast majority of
excess deaths occurred in selected northern provinces. However, differently from what previously
reported,10 this study is able to identify significant increases in many provinces and regions of the
South as well. The reasons for such north-south differences are still debated. A role was likely being
played by the timing and characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, which started in provinces of
the North with established trade connections with China and was amplified by the higher population
density and internal travel.21 The implementation of strict lockdown policies, including the restriction
in inter-regional movements, have likely contributed to reduce the spread of the infection and the
consequent increased mortality in other regions, particularly in the South. This aspect can also
explain the patchy map of risk across the country, where hotspots of risk can be the result of the
influx of infections from high-prevalence provinces of the North before strict lockdown policies
where implemented. Other suggested reasons of the geographical distribution of excess mortality
are the occurrence of mass gathering events that boosted local numbers of infections,22 and regional
differences in health service organization, socio-economic determinants, and urbanization.23-25
The assessment of results of stratified analysis offers interesting clues on sex and age differentials.
While this study confirms the higher risk in men, the difference is comparatively small, with a
percentage increase of 32.1% versus 27.7% in women. The analysis by age in Figure 2 reveals that
the highest excess occurred among the 70-79 years old, but it is lower in younger and elderly groups.
The risk is even lower but still present in the rest of the population, with evidence of excess deaths

even in people under 60 years old. The graph in Figure 3 shows instead some differences in the
timing of the excess mortality across sex, age groups, and area. The more delayed peak in women
and very elderly can be indicative of differential risk pathways, for instance related to reduction in
access to emergency services during the lockdown or the delayed surge of infections in nursing care
homes. The early decrease and then below average mortality in Central and Southern Italy can
instead imply that some of the excess is due to anticipation of death in frail individuals. These
suggestive results can form the basis of future analyses.
The figures reported in this study can be compared with those previously published in peer-reviewed
articles, although the comparison is made difficult by the different study population, study period,
data collection procedures, and analytical methods. Michelozzi and colleagues analysed data
collected within a surveillance system from 19 Italian cities, reporting a total excess mortality of 45%
from the beginning of March until the 18th of April 2020.9 The increase was higher in northern cities,
in men, and in the elderly, although with estimates that are somewhat different from the present
analysis, in part probably due to the focus to urban areas and the different period. Magnani and
colleagues used data released by ISTAT on 4,433 municipalities covering the whole Italian territory,
and quantified the extrapolated excess to the total Italian population in 44,352.5 and 680.4 deaths in
persons older and younger than 60, respectively, between the 1st of March and the 15th of April.10
They however reported negative estimates in several regions, in particular for the younger group.
These differences can be due to the simple pre-post comparison adopted in these studies, which
does not account for temporal trends and for the milder weather conditions in 2020.
This study benefits from the application of advanced two-stage design and statistical models that
allows a flexible estimation of the excess mortality risk and a definition of baseline risk that
considers temporal trends and variations in known risk factors. The analysis is performed at province
level and stratified by sex, age, and week periods, thus offering a fine characterization of the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Data and code are available, making the analysis entirely
reproducible, and the full set of results is released in the appendix and through a web application.
Some limitations must however be acknowledged. First, the low number of cases prevents the full
application of the two-stage modelling in age groups less than 50 years old, and therefore to address
the question about to which extent COVID-19 affects young people. Furthermore, the interrupted
time series design defines a simple pre-post comparison that cannot inform about the various
mechanisms leading to increased risks. The question about controlling or not for incidence of
seasonal influenza is emblematic in respect to this problem. Similarly, while the analysis of all-cause
mortality can provide a good estimate of the overall burden, it offers no information about the
various mechanisms, patho-physiological or of different nature, leading to increased deaths. Finally,

the analysis is based on an early-release dataset from ISTAT that has not been consolidated, and this
may lead to an underestimation of the number of deaths that occurred in 2020 and therefore of the
excess during the pandemic. These issues can be addressed when additional data and information
on the COVID-19 pandemic will be released.
In conclusion, this study offers a detailed picture of excess during the first months of the COVID-19
pandemic in Italy. The analysis indicates that excess mortality during the outbreak has been far
higher than the number of deaths officially reported as related to COVID-19, with strong
geographical differences and patterns of risk that varies by sex, age, and period. The figures can be
used in future research to explain differential risks across regions and sub-groups, and the role of
national or local policies implemented during the period.
