Forecasting of COVID-19 Confirmed Cases in Different Countries with ARIMA Models
Abstract
Background: The epidemic of a novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19) becomes as a global
threat. The aim of this study is first to find the best prediction models for daily confirmed cases
in countries with high number of confirmed cases in the world and second to predict confirmed
cases with these models in order to have more readiness in healthcare systems.
Methods: This study was conducted based on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 that were
collected from the official website of Johns Hopkins University from January 22th, 2020 to
March 1th, 2020. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to
predict the trend of confirmed cases. Stata version 12 were used.
Results: Parameters used for ARIMA were (2,1,0) for Mainland China, ARIMA (2,2,2) for Italy
, ARIMA(1,0,0) for South Korea, ARIMA (2,3,0) for Iran, and ARIMA(3,1,0) for Thailand.
Mainland China and Thailand had almost a stable trend. The trend of South Korea was
decreasing and will become stable in near future. Iran and Italy had unstable trends.
Conclusions: Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic.
Investigating their protocol in this control like quarantine should be in the first line of other
countries’ program

Background
A novel Virus belongs to Corona virus’s family that has been transmitter from animal to human
and was recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This can cause serious illness and
death (1). It has since been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus, similar to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and was named 2019-nCoV (2). A total number of 4515 cases
including 106 deaths were confirmed on 27th of January 2020(3). A local seafood market in
Wuhan was visited by many cases in the initial research, and it is indicated that a commonsource zoonotic exposure may cause this new illness (4) The prevalence scope of this disease is
unclear, because at present the prevalence of this disease is so dynamic(1). There is obvious
variation among countries in epidemiological surveillance and detection capacity for suspected
cases. (5) Several cases of COVID-19 infections were also reported outside China, in other Asian
countries, the United States, France, Australia, and Canada. In this situation when the illness
does not have any specific treatment, the prevention of disease and preparation in healthcare
services is very important .Modeling and future forecast of daily number of confirmed cases can
help the treatment system in providing services for the new patients .The statistical prediction
models could be helpful in forecasting and controlling this global epidemic threat. Here in this
study, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model could be useful to predict
the confirmed cases of COVID-2019. This model has more ability compared to some prediction
models such as wavelet neural network (WNN) and the support vector machine (SVM) in
prediction of natural disasters(6). The global geographic regions in this study are according to
World Health Organization (WHO) classification of regions. The data of countries with high
number of confirmed cases analyzed in this study was based on WHO regions. For each country,

the best ARIMA model is identified, and then 17 future days is predicted. The daily confirmed
cases data of COVID-2019 from January 22th, 2020 to March 1th, 2020 were collected from the
official website of Johns Hopkins University and were used to build these models. The aim of
this study is first to find the best predicting models for confirmed cases in countries with high
number of confirmed cases in the world and second to predict confirmed cases with these
models. These models can help in predicting patients in near future to have better treatment staff
preparedness in these countries.

Methods
Data source
The daily confirmed cases of COVID-2019 from January 22th, 2020 to March 1th, 2020 were
collected

from

the

website

of

Johns

University

(https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/ opsdashboard/index.html), and Microsoft Excel 2019
was used to build a time-series database
ARIMA models
A total number of 41 (from January 22th, 2020 to March 1th, 2020) days were collected to
develop ARIMA model.
The ARIMA models are important techniques in time series analysis that could be used in auto
correlated data analysis. These models include autoregressive (AR) model, moving average
(MA) model, and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model (7) .

The parameters of ARIMA model is as follows: (p, d, q)(P,D,Q)S generally, p refers to the order
of auto-regression, d refers the degree of trend difference, q refers to the order of moving
average, P refers to the seasonal auto-regression lag, D refers to the degree of seasonal
difference, Q refers to the seasonal moving average, S refers to the length of the cyclical
pattern(8).
Before analyzing, time series must become station-based on mean and variance. The Augmented
Dickey-Fuller (ADF) is used (9)in recognizing stationary in the mean and Box Cox test in
recognizing whether the time series is stationary based on variance or not. Log transformation
and differences are remedy approaches to stabilize the time series for variance and mean,
respectively (10). Seasonal differences were used to stabilize the series from seasonality trend.
The initial number of ARIMA model was guessed through autocorrelation function (ACF) graph
and partial autocorrelation (PACF) graph.
All the models that passed the residual test (normality and stationary in variance) were compared
using Akaike information criterion (AIC). The model which has the least AIC was selected as the
best model. The methodology of current study was based on a previous study as reference (11).
Microsoft Excel 2016 was used to build the database of daily COVID-19 in the world and
STATA version 12 software was adopted to develop the ARIMA model. The statistical
significance level was set at 0.05.
Ethics
Since no primary data collection was undertaken, no patient or public was involved; no formal
ethical assessment or informed consent was required. All data were collected from the official
website and all data were fully anonymized.

Results
Table 1 shows the ACF and PACF plots used for choosing the model parameters. The reporting
of these ACF and PACF showed that confirmed cases of COVID-2019 were not influenced by
the seasonality. According to these plots the P and Q parameters of ARIMA models were
guessed. Then the guess models were compared according to AIC value.

The final models that were reported in table 2 had the lowest AIC values. Table 2 shows the
forecast plots of ARIMA models for different countries with high number of confirmed cases
according to WHO regions. The closes of predicted plots with actual confirmed data could be
observed in these plots. This shows the precision of models in forecasting.

Table 3 shows the forecast for 17 days (from 5th of March until 21th of March) with 95%
confidence interval for different countries. This table shows that China may have stable trend
after 6th of March. South Korea presented a downward trend after 15th of March. This hope is
strong that this trend remains stable in near future in this country. Thailand almost controlled the
epidemic and had zero or one confirmed cases daily. Iran and Italy did not have a stable trend in
these 17 days.

The confirmed cases trend in China may become stable. South Korea will have a stationary trend
in near future. Thailand almost controlled and the confirmed cases for this country were
frequently between zero and one. Iran and Italy had unstable trend.

China’s confirmed cases showed stationary trend after 6th of March. This result is in accordance
with the result of previous study that predicted China’s epidemic to end up after March 10th,
2020(12). This may be due to sever control and quarantine that were performed in China. This
fact shows that quarantine worked well to reduce human exposure and control this epidemic. In
another study on Chinese data the trend of confirmed cases in China during 10th–24th of
January, 2020 was followed by exponential function (13).
This study confirmed that South Korea had an almost moderate trend that became decreasing
after 15th of March.
Iran did not have stationary trend even after 15th of March. In a study according to the passengers
that came from other countries such as UAE, Lebanon, and Canada the prevalence of cases in
Iran estimated about 18,300 cases assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the
country(14). This paper was published online on 22.2.2020. Therefore Iran is at the beginning of
the outbreak and the unstable trend was acceptable.
Thailand had the best control system in the exposure of this epidemic. Checking their program
could be the best guide for future epidemics.
Although more data are needed to have a more detailed prevision, these models could be helpful
in predicting future confirmed cases if the spread of the virus did not change very strangely. As
we know this virus is novel and have the ability to be transmitted severely. This ability may
affect all the predictions, but to our knowledge and for the time of writing, these models are the
best.

was also shown decreasing trend and may control this epidemic in near future. Investigating their
