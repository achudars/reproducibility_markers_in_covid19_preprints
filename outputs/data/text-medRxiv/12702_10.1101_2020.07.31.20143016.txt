Abstract
This study reveals the human mobility from various sources and the luxury nature
of social distancing in the U.S during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the
disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income counties.
We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple
mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data
from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We
further design a Responsive Index (ùëÖùêº) based on the time series of mobility change
percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to
COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive
correlations in the ùëÖùêº between either two data sources, revealing their general
similarity, albeit with varying Pearson‚Äôs ùëü coefficients. Despite the similarity,
however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting
characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility.
The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant
in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react
more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in ùëÖùêº between their upperincome and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of
mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first
study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets. The findings shed light
on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility
patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has undoubtedly raised worldwide
concerns. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared
COVID-19 as a pandemic, pointing to the sustained risk of further global spread (WHO,
2020a). As the new epicenter of the COVID-19, there had been 4,405,932 cases and
150,283 deaths in the U.S by July 30, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). They accounted for 26.2% and 22.7% of the global statistics
(WHO, 2020b). As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, social distancing, one of the
non-pharmacological control measures to reduce person-to-person contact, has emerged
as an effective measure to restrain the spread of infections (Jawaid, 2020). Studies
discovered that the considerable mobility reduction following the implementation of
social distancing measures is greatly responsible for the reduction of the transmission of
SARS-COV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic (Kraemer et al., 2020; Qiu
et al., 2020; Buckee et al., 2020; Oliver et al., 2020). However, the disproportionate
responses in mobility due to the different socioeconomic status reflects the long-standing
disparities in health outcomes and potentially leave more vulnerable populations uniquely
exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic (Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson, 2020; Coven and
Gupta, 2020).
The investigation of inequality and disease is not new in literature, as many pieces
of epidemiological evidence that prove a robust relationship between social inequality
and health outcomes have been found (Nguyen and Peschard, 2003; Muennig et al., 2005;
Cooper, 2001; Gaziano et al., 2010). Income, particularly, as one of the major factors in
socioeconomic status, is responsible for the noticeable disparities in the exposure of many
diseases (Siddharthan et al., 2018; Muennig et al., 2005; Breteler et al., 2013). For the
COVID-19 pandemic, Barnett-Howell and Mobarak (2020) found that the
epidemiological and economic benefits of social distancing are much smaller in poorer
countries, as the poor place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns compared
to contracting COVID-19. A recent study by Nayak et al. (2020) links the socioeconomic
vulnerability with mortality rates in U.S. counties. They find that counties with higher
social vulnerability (primarily driven by low income) are experiencing greater mortality
rates. By investigating the role of income inequality in moderating the effectiveness of
social distancing measures, Chiou and Tucker (2020) find that high-income earners are
more likely to self-isolate at home, and the evidence further suggests that the presence of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.20143016; this version posted August 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this

high-speed Internet plays an important role. What makes things worse is that the existing
income-induced disparities in the responses of COVID-19 tend to be exaggerated by the
recognized shortcomings of the U.S. protection measures (e.g., health insurance,
minimum incomes, unemployment benefits, and paid parental leave), potentially causing
long-term negative outcomes for the low-income populations (Coven and Gupta, 2020;
Lou et al., 2020). Despite the above efforts, multi-source and multiscale evidence is still
needed to understand whether/how the wealthy and the poor populations respond to the
COVID-19 pandemic differently.
Existing research has suggested that the disproportionate exposures to the risk
from the COVID-19 between the lower-income and upper-income groups can be properly
measured using the human mobility data, given the close relationship between human
mobility and the transmission of SARS-COV-2 (Tian et al., 2020; Xu and Li, 2020;
Fauver et al., 2020). Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many mobility data sources have
been made available to facilitate rapid monitoring in human mobility, most notably
Google mobility report derived from Google Maps (www.google.com/covid19/mobility)
and Apple mobility report derived from Apple Maps (www.apple.com/covid19/mobility).
In addition to the mobility data collected from cellphone navigation applications, mobile
network operators start to collaborate with local authorities and the federal government
to estimate the impact of mobility-reducing related measures (Oliver et al., 2020; Scott et
al., 2020). One notable effort is by Descartes Labs (www.descarteslabs.com), a platform
that has open-sourced the daily mobility statistics in the U.S. collected via mobile devices
(Warren and Skillman, 2020). As a more harmonized and less privacy-concerning data
source, social media data (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) are also favored by many scholars
to study the mobility dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Huang et al., 2020;
Yang et al., 2020). Given the existence of publicly available mobility datasets from
various sources, understanding their similarities and dissimilarities is in great need.
Owing to the multifaceted nature of human mobility (Gonzalez et al., 2008), however,
neither cellular records, navigation applications, nor social media, can solely represent
human mobility as a whole. Instead, they reflect human mobility from varying yet
valuable perspectives. Linking these perspectives with economic disparities contributes
to a better understanding of the mobility dynamics of groups with different
socioeconomic status in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this study, we aim to examine 1) the similarity and dissimilarity of mobility
from various sources, and 2) the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S during the

COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lowerincome and upper-income groups. We collect and compute mobility data from a variety
of sources, including Google and Apple mobility reports (navigation applications),
Descartes Labs mobility (cellular records), and Twitter (social media). To quantify the
general degree of mobility changes at the county level, we designed a responsive index
( ùëÖùêº ) via the time series of mobility change percentage using the sources above.
Specifically, we attempt to answer whether a consensus can be reached from various
mobility sources that the lower- and upper-income groups present contrasting mobility
dynamics during the pandemic, eventually leading to disproportionate exposures that
disfavor the lower-income group. Our study extends the increasing amount of literature
in understanding disparities via big mobility data. The findings of this study help us gain
knowledge of not only the similarities and dissimilarities in multi-source mobility data
but also the wealth disparity in tandem with the implementation of social distancing,
greatly benefiting epidemic modeling and policy-making for better mitigation of future
pandemics.
2. Mobility datasets and preprosessing
We collect and compute four open-source mobility datasets that cover the U.S., which
include 1) Mobility records from Descartes Labs using commercially available mobile
device dataset; 2) Apple mobility reports mainly from Apple Maps; 3) Google community
mobility reports mainly from Google Maps, and 4) Twitter-based mobility from
geotagged tweets. The finest spatial level of the mobility data from Descartes Labs,
Apple, and Google is the U.S. county level. Given that the U.S. National Emergency was
announced on March 13 and the majority of the U.S. states started to react aggressively
after mid-March, we present the daily mobility change percentage from March 1, 2020,
to June 30, 2020. We believe that this four-month period well covers different epidemic
phases in the U.S., thus providing valuable knowledge of how people react to the COVID19 pandemic by adjusting their travel behaviors accordingly. Although the four mobility
datasets in this study differ from each other in terms of data quantity, data quality, and
baseline calculations, we apply several preprocessing steps to make them more
comparable (as detailed in the following subsections). To ensure that data records are
sufficient enough to generate reliable and stable time series of mobility changes, we only
map the time series for counties with more than 100 days of mobility records (out of 122
days from March 1 to June 30). To fill the missing data, we apply a simple linear

interpolation, under the assumption that mobility changes linearly between two
consecutive available records.
2.1 Mobility data from Descartes Labs
The mobility dataset from Descartes Labs, a predictive intelligence company that makes
data-agnostic platforms for large-scale analysis, is open-sourced at GitHub
(https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19) and updated daily. The data cover a
total of 2,668 counties. Among them, 2,612 counties have mobility records in more than
100 days from March 1 to June 30). The data are derived from a collection of mobile
devices reporting consistently throughout the day. The distance measured in this dataset
is the daily maximum distance of a certain user, i.e., the maximum distance between a
user‚Äôs initial location of a day and other locations within the same day (details can be
found in Warren and Skillman et al. (2020)). The county-level mobility baseline is
defined as the median of the maximum distance of all users in a certain county on
weekdays from February 17, 2020, to March 7, 2020. The mobility change percentage is
further calculated by comparing daily mobility to the baseline. Due to the data quality
issues, mobility data on April 20 and May 29 are not released (Warren and Skillman et
al., 2020). To facilitate a smooth time series mapping, we generate mobility change
percentage on these two missing days for all available counties by averaging the values
of the corresponding days in the preceding week and following week. That is, the mobility
change percentage for April 20 is the average value of mobility change percentages on
April 13 and April 27, and May 29 is the average of May 22 and June 5.
2.2 Apple mobility reports
The raw mobility reports from Apple (www.apple.com/covid19/mobility) cover major
cities and a total of 63 countries (the U.S. included) and regions. Unlike Descartes Labs'
mobility data that measure the travel distance, Apple mobility reports are generated by
counting the number of requests made to Apple Maps for directions (Apple Mobility
Trends Reports, 2020). Despite the difference in measurement, the daily changes in the
number of requests from navigation services like Apple Maps still offer valuable insights
into people‚Äôs mobility changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Apple
provides mobility records in three different categories that include ‚Äútransit‚Äù, ‚Äúwalking‚Äù,
and ‚Äúdriving‚Äù, only ‚Äúdriving‚Äù is available for the U.S. at the county level. Apple mobility
reports cover 2,070 U.S. counties, and all the counties have mobility records in more than
100 days in the designated period. However, data for May 11 and May 12 are not

available. Following the same procedure in the Descarte Labs mobility, we generate
mobility data of the two missing days by averaging the corresponding days in the
preceding week and the following week. In addition, Apple defines the mobility from
January 13 as the baseline value. To make it comparable with Descartes Labs mobility,
we compute a new baseline value from February 17 to March 7 (the baseline period
defined in Descartes Labs mobility) and use it to adjust the mobility in the entire Apple
mobility dataset.
2.3 Google mobility reports
Google mobility reports use aggregated, anonymized data to chart movement trends over
time, across six different categories in ‚Äúretail and recreation‚Äù, ‚Äúgroceries and
pharmacies‚Äù, ‚Äúparks‚Äù, ‚Äútransit stations‚Äù, ‚Äúworkplaces‚Äù, and ‚Äúresidential‚Äù (Google
Community Mobility Reports, 2020). Although a total of 2,794 U.S. counties are covered,
our investigation reveals that the quantity of the records varies greatly across categories,
with ‚Äúworkplaces‚Äù having the most records and other categories insufficient for deriving
stable time series. Therefore, we select mobility in the category of ‚Äúworkplaces‚Äù for
further analysis. Google defines the baseline of the dataset as the median value for the
corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period January 3 to February 6. To
make it comparable with other datasets, we adjust the Google mobility records by
computing a new baseline value from February 17 to March 7. Within 2,794 counties
covered by the dataset, 2,110 counties have records in more than 100 days from March 1
to June 30 and are therefore selected to derive the mobility time series.
2.4 Twitter-based mobility
We have collected about 197 million geotagged (embedded with geolocation in the format
of exact coordinates or place names) tweets in a time period from January 1, 2020, to
June 30, 2020, from over 2.9 million unique Twitter users in the U.S. using the official
Twitter Streaming Application Programming Interface (API). Following the work by
Huang et al. (2020), we compute two types of distances 1) single-day distance (ùëëùë† ) that
reveals daily travel patterns and 2) cross-day displacement (ùëëùëê ) that reveals users‚Äô
displacement between two consecutive days. We then calculate a weighted distance(ùëëùë§ )
of each county by integrating these two distances (Equation 1).
ùëëùë§ =

ùëëùë† √óùë¢ùë† + ùëëùëê √óùë¢ùëê
ùë¢ùë† + ùë¢ùëê

(1)

where ùë¢ùë† and ùë¢ùëê denote the user counts for the calculation of ùëëùë† and ùëëùëê in each county,

respectively. By considering both single-day and cross-day distance, the weighted
distance is expected to reflect the overall mobility dynamics from Twitter. Our
investigation suggests that a stable time series can be achieved when the daily user count
for the distance calculation reaches 30 (see Figure A in the Appendices). Within the 2,981
counties covered by the Twitter dataset, 565 counties are qualified for the time series
mapping as their daily user counts are greater than or equal to 30 for more than 100 days
between March 1 and June 30. Following the baseline settings of the aforementioned
mobility datasets, we compute the mobility change percentage by setting the baseline
between February 17 to March 7.
3. Methods
3.1 Conceptualization of responsive index (RI)
The time series of the mobility change percentage from the various mobility sources
generally quantify the level of reaction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A
reduction in mobility denotes the positive response while an increase in mobility denotes
otherwise. The strength of the response is assumed to be proportional to the degree in
mobility changes. We use baseline mobility to divide the responsiveness into positive and
negative space. Different from the mobility-based responsiveness in Huang et al. (2020),
we calculate the ratios respectively in positive response and negative response to confine
our ùëÖùêº into a range of [-1,1]. Figure 1 describes the concept of the responsive index (ùëÖùêº)
using time series in mobility change percentage.

Figure 1. The concept of the responsive index using time series in mobility changes.

We first smooth the time series using a one-dimensional Gaussian filter to remove
the noises so that the general trend of mobility changes is revealed. The baseline
(representing no mobility change) divides the space into two parts: positive response with
reduced mobility (ùëÜùëÉ ) and negative response with increased mobility (ùëÜùëÉ ) (Figure 1). The
area between the baseline and the smooth time series is denoted as ùõº, while space excepts
ùõº is denoted as ùõΩ. In Figure 1, there are three individual ùëÜùëÉùõº regions, respectively denoted
as ùëÜùëÉ1ùõº , ùëÜùëÉ2ùõº , and ùëÜùëÉ3ùõº , and four ùëÜùëÅùõº regions, respectively denoted as ùëÜùëÅ1ùõº , ùëÜùëÅ2ùõº , ùëÜùëÅ3ùõº , and
ùëÜùëÅ4ùõº . We then quantify the response by computing two ratios: 1) ùëÜ 1

ùëÜùëÉ1ùõº +ùëÜùëÉ2ùõº +ùëÜùëÉ3ùõº

and 2)

, where the former ratio quantifies the strength of the positive

response, and the latter ratio quantifies the strength of the negative response (Figure 1).
The ùëÖùêº we propose is the difference between the two ratios. Given that Figure 1, for the
illustration purpose, confines the mobility change in a range from -100% to 100%, we
have ùëÜùëÉ1ùõº + ùëÜùëÉ2ùõº + ùëÜùëÉ3ùõº + ùëÜùëÉùõΩ = ùëÜùëÅ1ùõº + ùëÜùëÅ2ùõº + ùëÜùëÅ3ùõº + ùëÜùëÅ4ùõº + ùëÜùëÅùõΩ . In this study, however,
the mobility change percentage is unrestricted from 0% to 100% in the calculation of ùëÖùêº.
Generally, the ùëÖùêº can be calculated via the following equation:
ùëÖùêº =

‚àëùëñ ùëÜùëÉùëñ ùõº
‚àëùëñ ùëÜùëÉùëñ +ùëÜùëÉ

ùëñ +ùëÜ
‚àëùëñ ùëÜùëÅ
ùëÅùõΩ
ùõº

(3)

Our proposed ùëÖùêº has a range of [-1, 1] with ùëÖùêº = 1 suggesting a hypothetically
perfect responsiveness. Positive ùëÖùêº suggests that the accumulative response within a
specific period of time is positive, while negative ùëÖùêº suggests otherwise. The higher the
RI, the stronger the accumulative responsiveness a geographic region has.
3.2 Comparison of mobility datasets and their association with income
In this study, we aim to cross-compare mobility datasets from various sources and reveal
the linkage between mobility dynamics and income at the U.S. county level, as a county
is the finest geographical unit in mobility datasets from Apple, Google, and Descartes.
Let ùëÄùê∂ùëÉùëó denote the mobility change percentage of a certain county on day ùëó. We derive
the heat map by plotting all the available pairs, i.e., (ùëó, ùëÄùê∂ùëÉùëóùëò ), within the time frame
(March 1 to June 30) for each mobility dataset. In addition, we apply the Pearson
correlation analysis for the four open-source mobility datasets to determine 1) the
correlation of the derived county-level ùëÖùêº from each pair of mobility sources, and 2) the
correlation between county median income (from the latest ACS 5-year (2014-2018)

estimates) and the county-level ùëÖùêº. To reveal the disparity in mobility changes between
lower-income and upper-income counties, we first rank the available counties in each
dataset based on the median income and derive the time series of mobility change
percentages respectively for lower-income and higher-income counties by selecting the
median values. Given the fact that state policies may greatly shape county-level
mitigation strategies, we also visualize the statewide disparity in the time series of
mobility change percentages and the difference in ùëÖùêº for upper-income counties and
lower-income counties within each CONUS state to remove the potential impact resulting
from the statewide policies.
4. Results
4.1 Comparison of the four mobility datasets
In general, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is well documented from all four
mobility datasets, evidenced by the clear deviations in mobility from the baseline since
mid-March (Figure 2), when the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (March 11)
and the United States declared a National Emergency (March 13). In April, mobility from
all four datasets descended to the bottom and remained considerably lower than baseline
throughout the month. With the gradually loosened measures from the ‚ÄúOpening Up
America Again‚Äù guidelines, the mobility gained an upward momentum and started to
bounce back in early-May, resulting in the ‚ÄúU‚Äù shape distribution that can be observed
from all four datasets. Despite the similarity in the general trend, mobility from each
source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics. Data from Apple mobility
trend reports show that mobility in the U.S. had returned to the baseline in mid-May and
remained above the baseline in the entire June (Figure 2a), which contradicts the mobility
dynamics from the other three datasets where mobility is found not fully recovered to the
pre-pandemic level in May and June (Figure 2b-d). This characteristic of the Apple
mobility dataset can be partially explained by its single-day (January 13) baseline setting.
Although we adjust Apple‚Äôs baseline by extending the baseline temporal coverage, the
intrinsic monthly discrepancies in mobility between January and other months still exist.
That is, the above-the-baseline mobility in May and June is arguably the exaggeration
that results from the low baseline value observed on January 13. Compared with March
and April, the mobility change percentages show a more dispersed distributing pattern in
May and June (Figure 3a), indicating the inconsistency of counties in the recovering
phase. The dataset from Descartes Labs also suggests a strong recovery in mobility

following the lifting of strict measures since early-May (Figure 2b). In comparison to the
other three datasets, the reduction is more obvious in April, evidenced by the high
concentration close to -100% in mobility change. We investigate the counties with barely
any recorded mobility in April and find that they coincide well with the counties that were
the epicenter and faced strict stay-at-home orders (e.g., New York, Queens, and Kings in
the State of New York, and Alameda and Santa Clara in California). The close-to-zero
mobility in these counties can be explained by the data sources (i.e., commercially
available mobile device location dataset) (Warren and Skillman, 2020), which own a
more passive nature compared to the data collected via smartphone applications. Despite
the slight recovery in May and June, Google mobility shows a more concentrated
distribution that mostly remains below the baseline throughout the time period,
suggesting that the recovery of mobility in the category of ‚Äúworkplaces‚Äù is presumably
slower than other types. In addition, the reduction in April from Google mobility is
relatively less dramatic compared with other datasets. Our Twitter-based mobility dataset
reveals a similar reducing-and-recovering pattern (Figure 2d), although its heat map
presents a rather scattered distribution largely due to the uncertainties introduced from
the limited number of geotagged tweets in certain counties. Despite the scattered
distribution pattern, the significant mobility drop in mid-March and the constantly low
mobility in April are well captured by the heat map (Figure 2d).

The results from the Pearson correlation analysis reveal the similarity in computed
county-level ùëÖùêº from these four mobility datasets (Figure 3). As expected, we find
statistically significant positive correlations in ùëÖùêº between either two data sources, albeit
with varying Pearson‚Äôs ùëü coefficients (Figure 3). Google and Apple share the highest
correlation (ùëü = 0.60) owning to the fact that both of their mobility records are from
navigation applications in smartphones (i.e., Google Maps and Apple Maps). Despite the
high correlation between Apple and Google, however, the correlation between Apple and
the other two datasets is relatively weak (ùëü = 0.33 for Apple and Descartes, and ùëü = 0.31
for Apple and Twitter). Google and Descartes share the second-highest correlation (ùëü =
0.58), followed by Twitter and Descartes (ùëü = 0.58), and Twitter and Google (ùëü = 0.47).
The histograms of the four datasets suggest that the distribution of their county-level ùëÖùêº
follows the normal distribution, but the descriptive statistics vary markedly (Figure 3).
Given the low standard deviation, mobility computed from Google Maps reveals less
county-level variance in mobility changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which
is supported by its concentrated heat map (Figure 2a). The ùëÖùêº calculated from Apple
mobility (Mean = 0.07 and Median = 0.06) is considerably lower than the other three
sources because of documented strong negative responses (above the baseline) in most
counties since early-June (Figure 2a). As noted above, however, Apple‚Äôs low baseline
value on January 13 potentially shifts the entire time series upwards, consequently
responsible for the low ùëÖùêºs. Twitter (Mean = 0.32 and Median = 0.33) and Descartes
(Mean = 0.38 and Median = 0.38) share a similar distribution (histogram shape),

indicating that Twitter data is a good proxy of mobile phone data in capturing human
mobility.

4.2 Correlation between ùëπùë∞ and income
Recognizing that the human mobility-based response to the COVID-19 pandemic
includes both negative responses (ùëÖùêº < 0) and positive responses (ùëÖùêº > 0), we explore
the correlation between the full spectrum county-level ùëÖùêº and the county median income
(Figure 4). In general, all mobility datasets reveal a statistically significant positive
correlation between ùëÖùêº and income, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to
react more aggressively in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing more
moving activities compared to the pre-pandemic baseline. Nonetheless, we acknowledge
that correlation, no matter strong or weak, does not necessarily imply causation. A
detailed discussion regarding this issue can be found in Section 5.2. Despite the statistical
significance, the strength of the correlation varies among datasets due to the intrinsic
nature of their sources. The ùëÖùêº calculated from the Google dataset is strongly correlated

with income (ùëü = 0.65) (Figure 4c1-5c2). In comparison, Apple mobility derived from
Apple Maps, also a navigation service, shows a rather weak correlation between its
calculated ùëÖùêº and income (ùëü = 0.29) (Figure 4a1-a2). Three reasons are arguably behind
the Google-Apple difference in the strength of the correlation. First, Google mobility in
this study only includes the category of ‚Äúworkplaces‚Äù (given the insufficient records from
other categories) while Apple mobility considers all types of requests. Second, it is
reported that the median income for iPhone users in the U.S. is 40% higher than that of
Android users (Greenough, 2014). As a result, Apple Maps users possibly do not cover
as much demographic spectrum as Google Maps users. Third, the concepts of mobility
changes from Apple and Google differ, as Apple measures the change in the number of
requests while Google measures the change in the travel distance. Although both concepts
are able to reflect the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on human mobility, the difference
in calculation potentially causes the difference in the correlation strength. The
correlations between income and ùëÖùêº calculated from Descartes mobility and Twitter
mobility are both significant, and the correlation coefficients are 0.45 (Figure 4b1-b2)
and 0.37 (Figure 4d1-d2), respectively. The existence of many outlying counties in
datasets from Descartes and Twitter, i.e., counties with strong negative responsiveness
(ùëÖùêº < 0) (marked in blue bubbles), likely weakens the correlation.

4.3 Disparities in mobility between lower-income and upper-income counties
We further explore the county-level disparity in mobility dynamics between lowerincome and upper-income counties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 5
presents the time series of mobility change percentages for all available counties in the
four mobility datasets. Specifically, counties in the top 10% and bottom 10% in wealth
are highlighted respectively in red lines and blue lines (Figure 5). In general, the disparity
in mobility dynamics is well manifested in all mobility datasets, evidenced by the obvious
gaps between blue lines and red lines, especially after the declaration of the National
Emergency on March 13 (Figure 5). The increase in gaps after March 13 suggests the

diverging mobility pattern between lower-income and upper-income counties in response
to the pandemic. In addition, rich counties are found more responsive as they present
more reduction in mobility compared to poor counties, which is evidenced by the fact that
the red line (top 10% in wealth) consistently lies below the blue line (bottom 10% in
wealth) in all four mobility datasets. Among the four datasets, Descartes mobility presents
the most obvious diverging pattern compared to the other three datasets (Figure 5b).
Considering the low standard deviation, however, the separation in Google mobility
between the rich and poor counties is also noteworthy, as the red line and blue line are
too separated that the gap between them covers most of the time series (Figure 5c). In
comparison, the county-level disparities between rich and poor counties from Apple
(Figure 5a) and Twitter (Figure 5d) are less dramatic but still noticeable. Note that the
number of available counties varies among datasets (e.g., the Twitter dataset contains 565
counties, while the Descartes dataset contains 2,612 counties), which potentially
introduces a certain level of inconsistency and uncertainty when heterogeneous mobility
data are cross-compared.

trend report (2,070 counties); (b) mobility data from Descartes Labs (2,612 counties);
(c) Google community reports (2,110 counties); (d) mobility calculated via weighted
distance from Twitter (565 counties).

To reveal the disparity in mobility dynamics within each state, we derive the time
series of mobility change percentages for the top 20% and bottom 20% counties in wealth

within each CONUS state, removing the potential impact from the difference in statewide
mitigation policies. The rationale in selecting ‚Äú20%‚Äù (in contrast to the 10% in Figure 5)
is to include more counties in each state, especially for states with a small number of
counties. Figure 6 shows the statewise time series derived from Descartes mobility in a
pseudo-geographical representation of the CONUS states. The results from Apple
mobility and Google mobility can be found respectively in Figure A and Figure B in the
Appendices. Due to the insufficient number of counties available in each state, the results
from Twitter mobility are not presented.
For Descartes mobility, rich counties (the top 20%) within a certain state generally
tend to react more aggressively in mobility reduction compared to the poor counties (the
bottom 20%) within the same state (Figure 6). The disparity tends to be exaggerated in
the mobility recovery phase, i.e., May and June. For example, WA has seen a consistent
mobility drop after March 13, suggested by the overlapped blue line and red line.
However, the recovery phase in WA highlights the disparity in mobility dynamics, as the
poor counties (blue line) obviously gained earlier and greater upward momentum than the
rich counties (red line). This similar pattern can also be found in PA, MN, MI, and MA
(Figure 6). In comparison, NV stands out by showing the opposite pattern, and states that
include LA, TX, CA, MS, and MD present unnoticeable disparity between the rich and
the poor counties.
Despite the heterogeneity in sources compared with Descartes mobility, the
results from Apple (Figure B) and Google (Figure C) also reveal the general pattern that
rich counties tend to be more responsive by showing a higher mobility reduction rate
within most CONUS states in the selected time period. However, contrasting patterns,
although only a few, can still be found in some states from different mobility data sources.
For example, KS presents higher responsiveness for rich counties from Descartes
mobility but lower responsiveness for the rich counties from Apple mobility. In addition,
the pattern in ND from Google mobility contradicts the pattern from Apple mobility.

Figure 6. Time series of Descartes mobility change percentages for the top 20% and
bottom 20% counties in wealth at each CONUS state (pseudo-geographical
representation). For a state with less than five available counties, counties with the most
median income and the least median income are selected as the top 20% and the bottom
20%, respectively.

To quantitatively reveal the disparity in mobility responsiveness between the rich
and the poor counties, we calculate the difference in ùëÖùêº between the top 20% and bottom
20% counties in wealth (‚àáùëÖùêº) at each CONUS state (Figure 7). The values of ‚àáùëÖùêº are
presented in Table 1. In general, states with positive ‚àáùëÖùêº (in blue) are dominant in
number, as 40 states from Descartes mobility, 32 states from Apple mobility, and 42 states
from Google mobility, out of the 48 states in the CONUS, are with ‚àáùëÖùêº > 0 (Figure 8
and Table 1). Mobility datasets from the three sources suggest that, despite the noticeable
variances in ‚àáùëÖùêº, wealthy counties within each state are likely to have more mobilitybased responsiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the inconsistencies
from different mobility datasets need to be recognized, as it presumably results from the
intrinsic nature of the data sources and therefore warrants caution for further studies that
rely on only a single mobility data source.

5. Discussions
5.1 The fusion value in heterogeneous mobility data
Our investigation in Descartes, Apple, Google, and Twitter mobility reveals that they well
capture the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on human mobility by showing clear
deviations from the pre-pandemic baseline. Nevertheless, we observe considerable
dissimilarities among the datasets as each source presents unique characteristics. The four
selected mobility datasets in this study demonstrate the multifaceted nature of human
mobility that has been documented by many (Gonzalez et al., 2008; Cui et al., 2018), and
some believe these heterogeneous data sources reflect human mobility from different yet
valuable perspectives (Zhang et al., 2014; Lau et al., 2019). Zhang et al. (2014) argue that
most of the state-of-the-art theory and practice on human mobility focus on single-source
data in isolation from one another, inevitably leading to limited representativeness. In our
study, although dataset from Google and Apple are both derived mainly from cellphone
navigation applications, the time series in mobility change percentages and the correlation
analysis greatly highlight their difference. Since Google Maps is mainly targeted by
Android users while Apple Maps by IOS (iPhone Operating System) users, the difference
between Google mobility and Apple mobility can be partly explained by the difference
in their user‚Äôs demographics. Twitter mobility also shows a unique pattern in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, different from all other three mobility datasets. However, we
need to acknowledge the bias in Twitter data towards specific groups of the population
(Jiang et al., 2019, Mart√≠n et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2018).
It is reasonable to assume that the fusion of these mobility datasets mitigates the
biases to some degree and provides a holistic view of mobility dynamics in a broad
spectrum of the population. Numerous studies have been conducted, attempting to fuse
multi-source mobility data towards a more comprehensive one. To list but a few, Zhang
et al. (2014) proposed a systematic framework to integrate transit records and cellphone
records to mitigate biased sampling. Similarly, Montero et al. (2019) found that the fusion

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.20143016; this version posted August 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this

of heterogeneous mobility data sources facilities robust urban transportation models.
Despite these attempts, however, mobility data fusion is still scarce in the literature,
especially scarce in studies that tackle public health emergencies by means of mobility
monitoring. Global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic we are facing, uniquely
highlights the need for monitoring mobility dynamics in a comprehensive manner, as
integrated human dynamics from multiple sources is expected to better reflect the
multifaceted nature of human mobility, leading to the acquisition of overall knowledge
in mobility dynamics that cover a broader spectrum of the population. At the same time,
however, we argue that the representativeness of each source largely depends on the
demographics of the service users in relation to the demographics of the local population.
Thus, a proper weighting scheme based on their representativeness needs to be considered
when multi-source mobility data are fused.
5.2 The luxury nature of social distancing
Our exploration of the correlation between county-level ùëÖùêº and county median income
indicates that counties with higher income tend to be more responsive in terms of mobility
reduction compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, evidenced by the statistically
significant positive correlation between ùëÖùêº and income from all four mobility datasets.
Most states show a positive difference in ùëÖùêº between their upper-income and lowerincome counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages
can also be found. However, we need to acknowledge that correlation does not necessarily
imply causation. The reasons behind the disparity in mobility patterns for upper-income
and lower-income counties are multifaceted. Geographically, high-income counties in the
U.S. often coexist with large cities or urban fabrics, in which the dense population is hit
first and hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study found that 54% of urban
residents in the states view the disease as a major threat to day-to-day life, which
compares with 42% of those living in the suburbs and just 27% of rural residents in the
same states (Jones, 2020). The urban-rural discrepancy in threat awareness presumably
translates to the different mobility patterns in upper-income and lower-income counties.
In addition, upper-income counties within a certain state (usually with high urbanization)
tend to be the job centers that receive the commuting inflow of workers from nearby
lower-income counties (McKenzie, 2013). This difference in the commuting pattern is
also responsible for the county-level disparity in mobility dynamics. Other possible
explanations of less mobility responsiveness for lower-income counties can be traced to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.20143016; this version posted August 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this

the policies that sometimes unintentionally create inequity among different groups (Lou
et al., 2020). People respond to the mobility-restrict measures differently, largely
depending on their financial resources. The outcome of these measures may reflect the
preferences of the affluent but not the interests of the lower-income group (Lou et al.,
2020). Given the close relationship between human mobility and the transmission of
SARS-COV-2 reported from numerous studies (Gatto et al., 2020; Sirkeci and Yucesahin,
2020), the low mobility responsiveness in lower-income counties deserves more
attention, as slow reduction and fast recovery in mobility may foster the second ware of
infections, which could be exacerbated by the vulnerability in the low-income
populations.
5.3 Future directions
The findings from this study point to some potential areas for future research. First, future
research should investigate the representativeness of different mobility data sources,
setting up the foundations for integrated multi-source mobility that reveals the travel
behaviors for a broad spectrum of the population. Similarly, mobility monitoring studies
need to work towards a comprehensive mobility index preparing for future emergency
events, especially for global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies based on singlesource data should acknowledge the underlying biases in the sample and the potential
issues following these biases. Second, our study compares four open-sourced datasets that
include mobility records from Descartes Labs, Apple, Google, and Twitter. Future studies
can examine the similarity and dissimilarity in mobility patterns derived from other
passive/active citizen-sensor data, e.g., smart cards, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. Public surveys
and official mobility records from transportation services can serve as ground truth that
these mobility data are compared against. Comparative studies that include multiple
sources comparing against official records are still needed. The COVID-19 pandemic, an
event with dramatic mobility changes on a large scale, provides a great opportunity for
us to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each data source, laying the foundation for
the potential multi-source integration. Third, given that county is the smallest
geographical unit from Apple, Descartes, and Google mobility datasets, we explore the
correlation

between

county-level

income

and

county-level

mobility-based

responsiveness. However, changes in aggregated geographic units (e.g., from counties to
Census tracts) might alter the conclusions due to the famous Modifiable Areal Unit
Problem (MAUP) (Fotheringham and Wong, 1991). Future studies should investigate the

disparity in mobility at various spatial units or scales. Although income is one of the
fundamental factors in socioeconomic status, other factors may also contribute to the
disparity in responsiveness revealed in this study, therefore deserve further investigation.
Finally, the spatial incontinuity of the available counties in all four mobility datasets
precludes a detailed spatial examination. However, we acknowledge that spatial nonstationarity (regional variation) may exist in the contribution of socioeconomic factors to
the mobility dynamics. Future studies can consider spatial autocorrelation when using
other spatially continuous mobility datasets.
6. Conclusion
This study reveals the similarity and dissimilarity of human mobility from various sources
and the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic by
highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income
counties. We collect and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility
trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes
Labs, and 4) mobility calculated via weighted distance from Twitter. We further design a
Responsive Index (ùëÖùêº ) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to
quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness at the U.S. county level.
The results reveal that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is well documented,
as all mobility datasets show apparent deviations in mobility from the pre-pandemic
baseline. We find statistically significant positive correlations in ùëÖùêº between either two
data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson‚Äôs ùëü
coefficients. The ùëÖùêºùë† calculated from Google and Apple share the highest correlation
( ùëü = 0.60 ) presumably because both of their mobility records are from navigation
applications in smartphones (i.e., Google Maps and Apple Maps). Despite the similarity,
however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics,
demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. When correlation ùëÖùêº with
income, we find that positive correlation between ùëÖùêº and income is significant in all
mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more
aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the statistical significance, the strength of the correlation varies among datasets.
The ùëÖùêº calculated from the Google dataset is strongly correlated with income (ùëü = 0.65),

manifested from all mobility datasets. Most states present a positive difference in
ùëÖùêº between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in
time series of mobility changes percentages can be found.
To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares mobility datasets
from various sources during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings contribute to gaining
the knowledge of not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the
mobility disparity in tandem with the wealth disparity, benefiting policy design for better
mitigation of future epidemics and pandemics.
