Abstract

22

Here we describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed recurring ventilator-

23

associated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that acquired increasing levels

24

of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in response to treatment. Metagenomic analysis revealed

25

the AMR genotype, while immunological analysis revealed massive and escalating levels of

26

T-cell activation. These were both SARS-CoV-2 and P. aeruginosa specific, and bystander

27

activated, which may have contributed to this patient’s persistent symptoms and radiological

28

changes.

Main Text

31

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it the largest ever cohort of patients requiring

32

mechanical ventilation. Complications associated with such severe viral infections are many-

33

fold, and include increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections1,2, as well as post-

34

acute COVID-19, where patients experience symptoms extending beyond three weeks from

35

the onset of their first COVID-19 symptoms3. The first report of secondary infections in COVID-

36

19 patients was from Wuhan in March 2020, where 15% of hospitalized patients developed

37

secondary infections, and of those who did not survive their SARS-CoV-2 infection, 50% had

38

a secondary bacterial infection1. Since then many COVID-19 studies reporting secondary

39

infections have been published, with a recent meta-analysis of 24 independent studies that

40

included 3338 patients from five countries reporting that 14.3% of hospitalized COVID-19

41

patients developed a secondary bacterial infection, which is associated with significant

42

morbidity, mortality and the financial costs associated with prolonged hospitilisation2. The

43

incidence of post-acute COVID-19 varies depending on the group of patients considered, with

44

approximately 10% of patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus remaining

45

unwell beyond three weeks3. However, this can be as high as 74% when hospitalised patients

46

are considered, where symptoms include breathlessness and excessive fatigue, with

47

abnormal radiological features reported in 12% of this cohort4.

The DISCOVER study (DIagnostic and Severity markers of COVID-19 to Enable Rapid triage,

50

REC: 20/YH/0121) was established in March 2020 to collect and analyze longitudinal samples

51

from COVID-19 patients. One study participant, an otherwise healthy male between 45 and

52

55 years of age presented to hospital with Type-1 respiratory failure, 20 days after he tested

53

positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. At the time of testing he was asymptomatic (tested as

54

a house-hold contact of a health-care worker), and this represents Day 1 on the time-line

55

presented in fig. 1. He became symptomatic for COVID-19 13 days after this and his health

56

declined over the following week. Upon admission to hospital a chest X-ray was taken, and

57

he was admitted to the ICU where he was mechanically ventilated (fig. 1). An RT-PCR test on

58

an endotracheal sample collected at this time did not detect SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that he

59

had cleared the viral infection.

Fig. 1: The development of a recurring ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by a COVID-19
patient. A clinical time-line is presented from the point at which the patient tested positive for SARSCoV-2 (day 1), through to his discharge from the ICU (day 64). Noteworthy clinical features are
indicated in the yellow boxes below the time-line. The three x-rays taken during the patient’s time in
the ICU are presented, as is a later follow-up x-ray taken in an out-patient (OP) clinic three weeks
after discharge. The time during which the antibiotics piperacillin and tazobactam (pip/taz) and
meropenem were administered to the patient to treat the VAP are indicated in blue. The points at
which endotracheal tube aspirates (ETT) were collected and the subsequent analysis of these also
are indicated and described.

61

After a week in the ICU he was diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based

62

on clinical, radiological, biochemical and microbiological parameters. An antibiotic sensitive

63

Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was cultured from an aspirate collected from his

endotracheal tube (ETT-1, fig. 1). He was prescribed a seven-day course of piperacillin-

65

tazobactam (pip/taz) (4.5g every six hours), and clinically recovered from this bacterial

66

infection. Eight days after finishing this first course of antibiotics his VAP recurred, and a

67

pip/taz resistant P. aeruginosa was cultured from ETT-2 (minimum inhibitory concentration

68

(MIC) >16mg/l). He was prescribed a seven-day course of meropenem (1g every 8 hours) and

69

showed signs of clinical improvement. There were no further concerns about a bacterial

70

infection during his ICU stay although a third P. aeruginosa was cultured from a sample (ETT-

71

3) collected two days after he completed his course of meropenem, that was resistant to both

72

pip/taz and meropenem (MICs >16 mg/l and >8mg/l respectively). His health continued to

73

improve, and he was discharged to the respiratory ward a week later. The patient attended a

74

follow-up clinic 2-weeks after hospital discharge where he reported on-going symptoms such

75

as breathlessness and myalgia. A chest X-ray demonstrated persistent ground-glass opacities

76

throughout the lungs (fig. 1) and there was a significant drop in his oxygen saturations after

77

mild exertion to 84%.

78
79

To understand the cellular and molecular dynamics of this post-acute COVID-19 case from

80

the perspective of both the pathogen and patient’s immune response, longitudinal respiratory

81

and blood samples were collected and analyzed with a view to identifying early diagnostic

82

biomarkers of infection onset and potential opportunities for immunotherapeutic intervention.

83
84

Metagenomics was used to characterise in depth the composition and genomic features of

85

the bacteria present in this patient’s lower respiratory tract from when he first developed VAP

86

(ETT-1, fig. 1) to when he had recovered from his second VAP (ETT-3, fig. 1). We extracted

87

the entire genetic material from 500µl of ETTs 1 and 3 with no bacterial enrichment or human

88

DNA depletion steps, and to ensure data for the bacterial component of the samples was

89

generated, these were sequenced on a PromethION (Oxford Nanopore technology). From

90

ETT-1 whole genomes for both P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (fig. 2) were

91

generated. The P. aeruginosa isolate corresponded to multi-locus sequence type ST2535, a

world-wide clone frequently associated with AMR epidemics6. While the S. haemolyticus

93

isolate corresponded to ST10 (albeit with a new allele for the SH1431 locus5) and carried the

94

methicillin resistance conferring SCCmec element7. Coagulase negative staphylococci such

95

as S. haemolyticus are not recognised as lung pathogens and therefore typically ignored in a

96

diagnostic laboratory as probable contaminants from ETT samples. That we generated a

97

whole genome for this from this sample with no enrichment suggests it was present in a

98

significant abundance, although the clinical relevance of this remains to be determined.

104

ETT-3 generated a whole genome for P. aeruginosa, again corresponding to ST253, that

105

aligned with >99% identify to the genome from ETT-1. There were however two noteworthy

106

SNPs in this later sample that explain the increased AMR of this isolate. The mexR gene

107

encodes a repressor of the MexAB antibiotic efflux pump, and we found a SNP in mexR that

108

converts a key amino-acid (Arg91-Gln) in the DNA binding domain of the protein, that would

109

likely result in the de-repression of this efflux system9. A second SNP introduced a premature

110

stop codon in the oprD porin encoding gene (Tyr120-stop), that encodes a protein with a well-

111

established role in the entry of meropenem into the bacterial cell10.

112
113

Having recovered from both a viral and a recurring bacterial infection, we also sought to

114

analyse the kinetics of the patient’s innate and adaptive immune response across his time in

115

the ICU (at days 23, 28, 38, 45 and 58 from testing positive for SARS-CoV2, fig. 1). Robust

116

activation of a broad range of immune cell subsets was revealed by flow cytometry, when

117

compared to healthy controls. What was particularly striking was the level of activation and

118

proliferation of CD4+, CD8+ and TCR-gd T-cells, that appeared to wane between days 23-28

119

but were subsequently boosted after day 28, concomitant with the onset of the secondary

120

bacterial infection (Figures 3 a-c, Supplementary Figure S1). From day 28 a robust and steady

121

increase in the activation and proliferation of conventional and TCR-gd-T-cells was evident with

122

approximately 20% and 40% of total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells co-expressing the activation

123

markers HLA-DR/CD38, respectively. A similar steady increase in activation levels, albeit at

124

lower magnitudes, was observed for Natural Killer (NK) CD56dim and CD56bright cells (Figure

125

3d, Supplementary Figure S1). Similar perturbations in the frequency and activation

126

phenotypes of monocytes, blood monocyte-derived macrophages as well as neutrophils could

127

be detected from day 28 onwards (Supplementary Figure S2). A robust IgG response to both

128

SARS-CoV-2 and P. aeruginosa antigen was also detected in this patient (Supplementary Fig

129

S4).

131

Given the scale of the cellular response of this patient, we investigated whether the large

132

expansions of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were due to a T-cell response targeting SARS-CoV-2,

133

the secondary bacterial infection or to bystander T-cell activation11,12. We included the analysis

134

of bystander activation, which is T-cell receptor-independent and cytokine-mediated, as it is

135

known to occur during other types of acute viral infection11,12. The role of this type of T-cells

136

activation in the recovery of patients remains largely unclear, as these cells can participate in

137

protective immunity towards the virus but can also contribute to tissue damage11-14. We

138

performed a brief stimulation of the patient’s PBMCs, with or without overlapping peptides

139

spanning the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (spike, membrane (M) and nucleoprotein

140

(N)); of an immunodominant P. aeruginosa antigen (OprF); as well as an immunodominant

141

human Cytomegalovirus protein (HCMV pp65) as an indication of non-T Cell Receptor (TCR)

142

driven bystander activation. This was followed by intracellular cytokine staining to detect

143

production of IFN-g and TNF-a by the activated cells. Following the encounter with specific

144

peptides we observed a robust CD4+ T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 which decreased from

145

day 23 to day 58, and a more modest SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell response. This is in

146

line with published work, suggesting higher magnitudes of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ versus

147

CD8+ T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients15, as well as consistent detection of virus-specific

148

CD4+ T cells in recovered patients16 (Figure 1e-f, Supplementary Figure S3). CD4+ and CD8+

149

T-cell responses targeting P. aeruginosa peptides could also be detected and appeared to

150

increase over time concomitant with the onset of the recurring bacterial infection (Figures 1e-

151

f). However, that the number of T-cells responding specifically to SARS-CoV-2 and P.

152

aeruginosa represent only a fraction of those activated suggests that many of those detected

153

in the patient’s blood may be bystander activated, which is supported by the increased

154

magnitude of CMV-specific T-cell responses we detected over time (Figures 1e-f). Whether

155

the immune perturbations associated here with a case of post-acute COVID-19 are attributable

156

to the secondary bacterial infection is currently under investigation.

158

In this case report we demonstrate the potential of the application of multidisciplinary

159

technologies to longitudinally-collected patient samples to define the complex dynamics of

160

patient-pathogen-therapy interactions in real-time. Metagenomics directly applied to

161

respiratory samples facilitated the identification of the SNPs responsible for the AMR

162

phenotype of the later P. aeruginosa isolate. However, the most striking feature of this COVID-

163

19 case was the escalating number of circulating activated T-cells more than two months after

164

testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and six weeks after clearing the viral infection. While we

165

could attribute some of this to the recurring bacterial infection, the scale of the activation

166

considered alongside our evidence of increased frequencies of T-cells specific for unrelated

167

antigens, suggests there may be a significant amount of bystander activation. This could play

168

a critical role in the severity of illness and the longer-term complications associated with the

169

development of post-acute COVID-19 experienced by this patient17. Given the recent

170

appreciation for the role of corticosteroids in reducing the risk of death following SARS-CoV-

171

2 infection by 20%16, this case suggests that targeting its use to patients with immunological

172

responses as described here, may also improve their long-term recovery.
