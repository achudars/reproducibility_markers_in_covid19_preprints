Abstract
Background
The natural history of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has yet to be fully described,
with most previous reports focusing on hospitalised patients. Using linked patient-level data,
we set out to describe the associations between age, gender, and comorbidities and the risk
of outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and/or related mortality.
Methods
A population-based cohort study including all individuals registered in Information System
for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP). SIDIAP includes primary care records covering > 80%
of the population of Catalonia, Spain, and was linked to region-wide testing, hospital and
mortality records. Outpatient diagnoses of COVID-19, hospitalisations with COVID-19, and
deaths with COVID-19 were identified between 1st March and 6th May 2020. A multi-state
model was used, with cause-specific Cox survival models estimated for each transition.
Findings
A total of 5,627,520 individuals were included. Of these, 109,367 had an outpatient
diagnosis of COVID-19, 18,019 were hospitalised with COVID-19, and 5,585 died after either
being diagnosed or hospitalised with COVID-19. Half of those who died were not admitted to
hospital prior to their death. Risk of a diagnosis with COVID-19 peaked first in middle-age
and then again for oldest ages, risk for hospitalisation after diagnosis peaked around 70
years old, with all other risks highest at oldest ages. Male gender was associated with an
increased risk for all outcomes other than outpatient diagnosis. The comorbidities studied
(autoimmune condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
dementia, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and
type 2 diabetes) were all associated with worse outcomes.
Interpretation
There is a continued need to protect those at high risk of poor outcomes, particularly the
elderly, from COVID-19 and provide appropriate care for those who develop symptomatic
disease. While risks of hospitalisation and death are lower for younger populations, there is
a need to limit their role in community transmission. These findings should inform public
health strategies, including future vaccination campaigns.

Introduction
The natural history of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has yet to be well-established.
While a wide range of studies have described outcomes among patients hospitalised with
COVID-19,1,2 these individuals represent only a fraction of those who develop symptomatic
disease. Similarly, while outcomes for tested populations have also revealed important
insights,3,4 COVID-19 testing has often been prioritised on the basis of individuals’ symptoms
or perceived risk of outcomes, making inferences about specific risk factors for progression
among these populations difficult.5
A full description of the natural history of COVID-19 from symptomatic to severe disease is
needed. Such a description requires comprehensive patient-level data that captures
incident, symptomatic cases from a representative population, with subsequent longitudinal
follow-up, and where outcomes such as hospitalisations and mortality, both inside and
outside of the hospital setting, can be identified. Moreover, assessing the impact of chronic
health conditions on the course of the disease requires comprehensive data on patients’
medical histories. Linked real world data from countries with universal taxpayer-funded
primary care-based health systems where general practitioners are the first point of contact
for care, and where this role has been maintained in the response to COVID-19, provide a
unique opportunity for this purpose.
In Spain, one of the European countries worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care
has continued to play an important role in the response to the disease. In Catalonia, an
autonomous region of Spain with a devolved health system, more than 120,000 outpatient
cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed between 15th March and 24th April 2020.6 Meanwhile, a
nationwide seroprevalence study conducted between 27th April to 11th May, 2020 found the
prevalence of IgG antibodies to be around 5% in Spain, and 7% in Catalonia.7 Consequently,
despite the burden of disease already experienced, there is a need to better understand the
features of COVID-19 so as to inform the continued national and global response to it.
Our aim in this study was to describe the associations between age, gender, and
comorbidities and risks of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation with COVID-19, and a COVID19-related death. The research questions addressed are inferential, assessing the existence
of relationships but not the underlying mechanisms or reasons for them.8

Methods
Study design
This study has been informed by primary care records from Catalonia, Spain, which were
linked to COVID-19 test results, hospital records, and mortality data. The resulting database
was comprehensive, allowing for the identification of various key events in the progression
of COVID-19 over the study period, which began on the 1st March 2020 and ended on the 6th
May 2020. A multi-state cohort model provided the framework for analysis, allowing for a
systematic consideration of transitions for the general population to diagnosis of COVID-19,
hospitalisation with COVID-19, and COVID-19 mortality.

Study participants, setting and data source
Individual-level routinely-collected primary care data were extracted from the Information
System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP; www.sidiap.org) database, which captures
patient records from approximately 80% of the Catalan population and is representative in
geography, age, and gender.9 Linkage was made at an individual-level to COVID-19 PT-PCR
testing data, hospital data, and regional mortality data.
The entire database has been mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
(OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This provided a means of structuring the data to a
standardised format, and allowed for the application of analytical tools developed by the
open-science Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network.10
All individuals in SIDIAP as of the 1st March 2020 were identified. Those individuals with at
least one year of prior history available, no prior clinical diagnosis or positive test result for
COVID-19, and who were not hospitalised on the 1st March 2020 were included in the study.
Study follow-up began on the 1st March 2020 and ended on the 6th May 2020 (the last date
of available data).

Variables
Individuals’ age and gender were extracted. Health conditions, using individual’s observed
medical history were identified. The Charlson comorbidity index was calculated for
individuals using the algorithm previously developed by OHDSI,11 and scores were

categorised as 0, 1, 2, or 3+. Ten specific health conditions were also extracted, all of
interest as potential risk factors for the progression of COVID-19. Autoimmune condition
(which included type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison’s disease, Grave’s disease, Sjorgen’s
syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pernicious anemia, celiac
disease, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease), chronic kidney
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, heart disease,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm excluding non-melanoma skin cancer,
type 2 diabetes mellitus were each identified on the basis of diagnosis codes. Obesity was
identified either by a diagnosis code, a record of a body mass index measurement between
30 and 60 kg/m2, or a recorded weight between 120 and 200 kg within 5 years of the index
date.
Study outcomes included an outpatient clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, a hospitalisation with
COVID-19, and death. Outpatient COVID-19 diagnoses were identified on the basis of a
compatible clinical code being recorded for COVID-19 disease (ICD-10-CM codes B34.2
“Coronavirus infection, unspecified” and B97.29 “Other coronavirus as the cause of diseases
classified elsewhere”). Hospitalisation with COVID-19 was identified as a hospital admission
where the individual had a positive PT-PCR test result or a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19
over the 21 days prior to their admission up to the end of their hospital stay. Mortality was
identified using region-wide mortality data, and so included both deaths during
hospitalisations and in the community.

Statistical methods
Multi-state model
A multi-state model provided the framework for the analysis. Multi-state models allow for a
consideration of individuals progression to multiple events of interest, extending on
competing risk models by also describing transitions to intermediate events.12 In the context
of COVID-19, clinical diagnoses of the disease and hospitalisations with the disease can be
considered as key intermediate events between not being infected (or at least, not having
been identified as being so) on one end to death on the other.

The structure of the multi-state model used in this study is shown in Figure 1. There were
four states: general population, outpatient diagnosis with COVID-19, hospitalised with
COVID-19, and death. The model is progressive with all individuals beginning in the general
population state (as described above, individuals included in the study had no prior history
of COVID-19 and were not hospitalised on their index date). Six transitions were possible:
from general population to outpatient diagnosis with COVID-19, from general population to
hospitalised with COVID-19 (i.e. individuals who did not get a clinical diagnosis prior to
hospital admission), from general population to death, from outpatient diagnosis with
COVID-19 to hospitalised with COVID-19, from outpatient diagnosis with COVID-19 to death,
and from hospitalised with COVID-19 to death. Given the research objectives, the analyses
focused on the five transitions directly related to COVID-19, with the general population to
death used primarily as a means of accounting for the competing risk of death for the study
population (although it should be noted that individuals who died with COVID-19, but had
not been diagnosed or received a positive test will also be included in this transition).

Describing the association between age and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis,
hospitalisation, and death
The relationship between age and the risk of each transition in the multistate model was
assessed by estimating cause-specific Cox models, with hazard ratios and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) calculated. A non-linear relationship between age and the risk of
transitions was considered by fitting age with a polynomial of degree 2 (i.e. quadratic) and
with restricted cubic splines (with 3, 4, or 5 knots).13 Comparisons between these, and a
model where age was assumed to have a linear relationship, were made using Akaike
information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Where a more
parsimonious model was seen to well-approximate a more complex one, the simpler model
was favoured. Models were first estimated with age as the sole explanatory factor, with
additional adjustment subsequently made for comorbidities, with the Charlson score and
the ten specific conditions of interest described above also included as explanatory factors
in the model. To consider whether associations between age and outcomes varied by
gender, models were also estimated separately for males and females.

The relationship between gender and the risk of each transition in the multistate model was
also assessed by estimating cause-specific Cox models. Gender and age were first included
as explanatory factors, with non-linearity in age incorporated in the same way as for the
previous research objective. Subsequently, as above, adjustment was also made for
comorbidities. To consider whether associations between gender and outcomes varied by
age, models were also estimated separately for those aged 70 or younger and those aged
over 70 (with age assumed to have a linear relationship within each of the strata).

Describing the association between comorbidities and risk of transitions
The relationship between comorbidities and each transition was assessed by estimating
cause-specific Cox models. Models were estimated for each comorbidity of interest
separately, controlling for age and gender and with non-linearity in age incorporated in the
same way as described above. To consider whether associations between comorbidities and
outcomes varied by age and gender, models were subsequently estimated stratifying by
both age (70 or younger or above 70) and gender, with age also included as an explanatory
factor within each of the strata as a linear term.

Software used and code availability
The mapping of source SIDIAP data to the OMOP CDM was facilitated by various opensource OHDSI software, which included usagi,14 to help define mappings from source codes
to the standard concepts used in the CDM, and Achilles,15 to help assess data quality after
mapping. Data analysis was performed in R version 4.0.0. The R packages used in the
analysis included OHDSI CohortDiagnostics,16 numerous tidyverse packages,17 mstate,18 and
rms.19 The analytic code used in this study is freely available at
https://github.com/SIDIAP/MultiStateCovid-19. Cohort definitions were adapted from those
used in the OHDSI Seek COVER study and the OHDSI CHARYBDIS project.20,21 A web

Results
Study participants and observed outcomes
A total of 5,627,520 participants were included in the study. Based on the study eligibility
criteria described above, 169,577 individuals were excluded due to a lack of a year of prior
history, fewer than 5 people for a previous positive COVID-19 test result, 312 for a prior
clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, 19 for a prior hospitalisation with COVID-19, and 1,306 who
were hospitalised on the 1st March 2020). The characteristics of the included study
population are summarised in Table 1, a histogram of the age distribution can be seen in
Figure A1, and a summary of comorbidities are shown in Figure 2.
Out of the included study population, 109,367 went on to have an outpatient diagnosis of
COVID-19 (67-day cumulative incidence: 1.94%). Of those diagnosed in outpatient settings,
2,794 died with COVID-19 without being hospitalised (45-day cumulative incidence: 3.11%).
In total, 18,019 individuals had a hospitalisation with COVID-19, with 9,437 of them having
previously had an outpatient diagnosis (45-day cumulative incidence: 9.03%). Of those
hospitalised, 2,791 had died with COVID-19 by the end of follow-up (45-day cumulative
incidence: 19.03%), see Figure 1 and Table 2. An extensive summary of the observed data
can be seen alongside the study code at https://github.com/SIDIAP/MultiStateCovid-19.

The association between age and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis,
hospitalisation, and death
Age profiles varied by transition, see Table 1. While the median age of the study population
as a whole was 44 (interquartile range: 25 to 60), those diagnosed with COVID-19 were 47
(IQR: 36 to 61), and those hospitalised without an outpatient diagnosis were 72 (58 to 81).
Individuals hospitalised after a diagnosis of COVID-19 were on average 61 (50 to 75) years
old, and those who died after being diagnosed with COVID-19 (but who were not admitted
to hospital beforehand) had an average age of 87 (81 to 91). Individuals who died after
being hospitalised had an average age of 81 (73 to 87).
Estimated hazard ratios for age are shown in Figure 3 and summarised in full detail in
Appendix Table A1 to A5. A non-linear relationship can be seen for outpatient diagnosis with
COVID-19, with risks peaking first among those aged around 45 and then again at oldest

ages. Relative to a reference age of 65, estimated hazard ratios were 0.69 (95% confidence
interval: 0.68 to 0.70) for a 20-year-old, 1.62 (1.59 to 1.65) for a 45-year-old, and 2.13 (2.07
to 2.18) for a 90-year-old. Risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 after an outpatient diagnosis
of COVID-19 peaked at around age 70, with estimated hazard ratios of 0.24 (0.22 to 0.25) for
a 45-year-old, 1.10 (1.09 to 1.11) for a 70-year-old, and 0.70 (0.65 to 0.74) for a 90-year-old,
all relative to a reference age of 65 years old.
Older age was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 without a
prior diagnosis, death after being hospitalised with COVID-19, and, in particular, death after
being diagnosed but without being hospitalised. An age of 90 years old was associated with
hazard ratios, relative to 65 years old, of 3.00 (2.84 to 3.16), 6.41 (5.84 to 7.04), and 17.17
(15.55 to 18.97) for each of these, respectively. For an age of 20, these relative hazard ratios
were all estimated to be less than 0.01. Adjustment for comorbidities attenuated the
associations for older ages to some degree, but not in their entirety. Models estimated
separately by gender gave broadly comparable results, see Appendix Tables A1 to A5 and
Appendix Figure A2.

The association between gender and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis,
hospitalisation, and death
Compared to the study population as a whole, which was 51% female, a greater proportion
of females were diagnosed with COVID-19 (59%), but more males (56%) transitioned directly
to being hospitalised with COVID-19 without a previous outpatient diagnosis. Of those
diagnosed, more males (54%) were subsequently hospitalised, but more females (58%) died
without having been hospitalised. Of those hospitalised, 60% of those who died were male,
see Table 1.
After adjustment for age, male gender was associated with a reduced risk of outpatient
COVID-19 diagnosis (hazard ratio: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.73 to 0.74]). Conversely, male gender was
associated with an increased risk of all other transitions and hence with more severe forms
of COVID-19 disease (Figure 4). Hazard ratios for males were 1.61 (1.55 to 1.69) for
hospitalisation with COVID-19 without outpatient diagnosis, 1.82 (1.75 to 1.90) for
hospitalisation after outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, 1.75 (1.62 to 1.89) for death after
outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19, and 1.41 (1.31 to 1.52) for death after hospitalisation with

COVID-19. Further adjustment for comorbidities made little difference to these estimates,
see Figure 4. Estimates were also broadly consistent across age-stratified models, although
female gender was associated with an even greater increase in risk for the transition from
diagnosed with COVID-19 to death for those aged 70 years old or younger, see Appendix
Table A5 and Appendix Figure A3.

The association between comorbidities and risk of outpatient COVID19 diagnosis, hospitalisation, and death
Comorbidity profiles varied across different stages of the natural history of COVID-19, see
Table 1 and Figure 2. The highest proportion of otherwise healthy participants (Charlson
index score of 0) was seen among those diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings
(75%) and lowest amongst those who died after an outpatient diagnosis without hospital
admission (14%). While, for example, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, COPD,
obesity, and type 2 diabetes were 4%, 2%, 17%, and 6%, respectively, among the study
population as a whole, the prevalence of these conditions was 31%, 14%, 40%, and 26%
among those who died after being hospitalised with COVID-19. Of those individuals that
died after diagnosis of COVID-19 without have being hospitalised, 40% had dementia (see
Table 2). Indeed, among women who died after diagnosis of COVID-19 without have being
hospitalised, close to 60% had dementia (see Figure 2).
After accounting for age and gender, dementia had the strongest association with risk of
outpatient diagnosis with COVID-19 (hazard ratio: 3.65 [95%CI: 3.53 to 3.77]), see Figure 4.
Aside from malignant neoplasm, all other comorbidities were associated with increased risks
of outpatient diagnosis, with estimated hazard ratios between 1.08 (1.05 to 1.12) for chronic
kidney disease to 1.16 (1.12 to 1.21) for COPD. Similarly, all conditions were associated with
an increased risk of hospital admission for COVID-19 without a previous outpatient
diagnosis, with obesity (hazard ratio: 1.74 [1.66 to 1.82]) and dementia (1.82 [1.67 to 1.99])
associated with the greatest excess risks.
Dementia was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalisation after diagnosis, but an
increased risk of death without hospitalisation, with age and gender adjusted hazard ratios
of 0.59 (0.54 to 0.65) and 1.92 (1.77 to 2.08) respectively. Aside from COPD where no
association was seen, all other conditions were associated with an increased risk of

hospitalisation after outpatient diagnosis, ranging from a hazard ratio of 1.05 (1.00 to 1.10)
for hypertension to 1.59 (1.52 to 1.66) for obesity.
While fewer conditions appeared associated with an increased risk of death following
outpatient diagnosis, cancer had a hazard ratio of 1.24 (1.13 to 1.35), chronic kidney disease
had one of 1.31 (1.21 to 1.42), and type 2 diabetes one of 1.31 (1.20 to 1.43). Among those
hospitalised, while little difference in outcomes was seen for those with hyperlipidaemia and
hypertension after adjusting for age and gender, other conditions were associated with
increased risks with hazard ratios ranging from 1.10 (1.02 to 1.18) for obesity to 1.64 (1.47
to 1.83) for dementia.
The association between the Charlson comorbidity index and transitions was most clearly
seen for the risks of hospitalisation without a previous diagnosis and of death following an
outpatient diagnosis with COVID-19 without hospitalisation. A score of three or more was,
relative to a score of zero, associated with age and gender adjusted hazard ratios of 2.31
(2.17 to 2.46) and 2.34 (2.07 to 2.65) respectively.
While stratified analyses by age and gender generally revealed broadly consistent estimates,
various comorbidities were associated with an even greater increase in risk for younger, and
particularly female, study participants for a number of transitions, see Appendix Table A6
and Appendix Figure A4 and A5. Obesity, for example, was associated with hazard ratios of
2.67 (2.42 to 2.94) and 2.10 (1.95 to 2.27) for hospitalisation from general population and
hospitalisation after a diagnosis with COVID-19.

Discussion
Summary of key results
In this large cohort study, primary care data from 5,627,520 individuals with linked COVID19 testing, hospitalisation, and mortality data has allowed for a detailed characterisation of
the natural history of symptomatic COVID-19 as seen during the peak of the epidemic in
Spain. Over 100,000 outpatient COVID-19 diagnoses, more than 18,000 hospitalisations with
COVID-19, and 5,500 related deaths were observed between 1st March and 6th May. Of
these deaths, half were among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings
but not admitted to hospital.

Older age was consistently associated with increased risks of hospitalisation and mortality,
most dramatically for risk of death following an outpatient diagnosis of COVID-19 without a
subsequent hospital admission. There was though a notable peak in risk of outpatient
diagnosis for people in middle-age. A differential association was seen with gender; while
women were at increased risk of outpatient diagnosis, men were consistently at higher risk
of hospitalisation and death. Finally, the specific comorbidities studies (autoimmune
condition, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, heart
disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, malignant neoplasm, obesity, and type 2 diabetes),
and a composite comorbidity index (Charlson Comorbidity Index) were associated with
worse outcomes. In a number of cases the increase in risk associated with comorbidities
appeared to be particularly pronounced for women aged under 70.

Findings in context
Older age has consistently been found to be a risk factor for worse outcomes in COVID-19. It
has been associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation after testing positive for COVID19,3,4 worse outcomes among those hospitalised,1,2 and COVID-19-related mortality among
the general population.22 Similarly, in our study we find age to be associated with poorer
outcomes. Our findings suggest that not only is age associated with increased disease
severity, but that there was also likely inequitable access to care during the height of the
pandemic in Spain. The increase in risk for age was most strongly seen for the transition
from diagnosis to death (with no admission to hospital seen between the two), while the risk
of hospitalisation itself was also seen to fall at oldest ages. This may reflect rationing of
health care resources, with younger patients likely prioritised for the receipt of hospital care,
and intensive services if admitted. With half of the deaths in this study observed among
those not hospitalised after diagnosis, who had an average age of 87, it is of uptmost
importance that similar individuals should be given appropriate access to care in the future.
Our results also provide further insights on community transmission of COVID-19. A peak in
diagnosis of COVID-19 was seen among individuals around the age of 45 years old. While
this may to some degree reflect differences in health seeking behaviour across age groups, it
likely also reflects differences in infection rates across age groups. A large and wellconducted study in Spain found that seroprevalence rose until plateauing at around age of

45 based on point-care-tests, but that seroprevalence was lower for those older than 85
compared to younger adults given immunoassay results.7 Meanwhile, a seroprevalence
study in Geneva found that those aged between 20 and 49 had the highest likelihood of
being seropositive.23 Consequently, while seemingly facing lower risks of poor outcomes if
infected, younger age groups are being infected and appear to contribute to the spread of
the virus in the community.
Male gender has also been associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19, with increased
risks for both hospitalisation among those tested,3 and worse outcomes among those
hospitalised.2,3 Our data are compatible with previous literature, with risks of admission and
mortality all increased for males. However, we found the opposite effect for outpatient
diagnosis, with women being at increased risk of diagnosis with COVID-19 in the community.
While this finding contrasts with two UK studies, which reported a higher risk of testing
positive for SARS-CoV-2 among men,24,25 it is congruent with the findings from a study from
China that reported a higher attack rate among women.26 In Spain, seroprevalence was seen
to be similar for males and females.27 Further research is therefore needed to understand
this finding, which could be explained by differences in exposure and/or vulnerability to
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or differences in health
seeking behaviour between men and women.
Comorbidities have been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 in this study. In line
with our findings, those with a higher Charlson score testing positive for COVID-19 have
been previously seen to have an increased risk of hospitalisation and death.4
Dementia was seen in our study to be associated with a much-increased risk of diagnosis
with COVID-19. This pattern likely reflects both outbreaks of COVID-19 in nursing homes, but
also increased surveillance with nursing homes systematically screened for COVID-19 in
Barcelona.28 For those diagnosed, dementia was associated with a reduced risk of
hospitalisation, but an increased risk of death without hospitalisation. This may reflect the
failure to provide and seek prompt care in these settings, but also difficulties in accessing
appropriate hospital care for residents.
Other comorbidities were seen to be associated with worse outcomes, which is in
accordance with previous findings on outcomes for individuals with chronic kidney disease,
COPD, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cancer, obesity and type 2 diabetes

mellitus.2–4,24,25 Our findings have also generally shown the effect of type 2 diabetes, obesity,
and chronic kidney disease to be most pronounced among women under 70. Fewer studies
have assessed the relationship between autoimmune conditions and outcomes. As with
other comorbidities, we found autoimmune conditions to be associated with an increased
risk of poorer outcomes in COVID-19. Further research is though certainly merited to
consider each of these conditions in turn and consider the impact of other factors such as
these individuals’ medication use.

Study limitations
Our study is informed by routinely-collected health care data with various interactions
between individuals and the health system identified, covering outpatient diagnoses, COVID19 testing, and hospitalisations, and with linked mortality data. This though unavoidably
misses health outcomes experienced by individuals that do not lead to any interaction with
the health care system, with both asymptomatic individuals and a sizeable proportion of
mild symptomatic cases unlikely to be seen. Some of the clinical diagnoses observed in the
study may also represent false positives, given the uncertainty surrounding the presentation
of the disease during the study period. We did not require clinical diagnoses to be confirmed
by the presence of a positive PT-PCR test given the limited amount of testing being
performed during the study period. Deaths from COVID-19 where individuals were not
tested or diagnosed beforehand will also not have been identified.
While providing a broad picture of clinical trajectories, each of the studied states and
transitions can, and should, be considered in further detail. Analyses of the provision of
intensive care admissions during hospitalisation is one such example, but would require
further data with sufficient granularity on inpatient treatment which was beyond the scope
of this study. Similarly, the set of comorbidities considered here are only a subset of the
myriad set of conditions that are of interest when considering potential risk factors for
COVID-19. Our classifications are broad, and we have not attempted to split conditions by
severity or concurrent medication use.
The purpose of this study was descriptive in nature. The aim was not prediction, nor was it
causal inference. In particular, it should be noted that associations between specific
comorbidities and outcomes do not necessarily reflect a causal relationship. Assessing

whether a particular chronic condition is the cause worse outcomes in COVID-19 will require
further consideration of, and accounting for, relevant confounding factors.

Conclusion
In this descriptive study we provide a comprehensive overview of the natural history of
symptomatic COVID-19 in Catalonia, Spain. The findings from this study can help inform the
continued response to COVID-19 both in Spain and elsewhere. Our research has helped to
reveal a clear need to protect at risk populations, particularly the elderly, whilst also
considering middle-age populations at a particularly high risk of milder infections and
therefore likely key in the community transmission of the disease. Future public health
strategies, such as potential lockdowns, shielding, and vaccination campaigns, should take
these findings into consideration.

Figures
Figure 1. Multi-state model of COVID-19.
The entire study population began in the general population state as of the 1 st March 2020,
with progression through the model possible up to 6th May 2020.

Figure 2. Prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 affected and general population
The prevalence of comorbidities of interest are shown here for the study population as a whole, and for the individuals who made each of the
transitions in the multi-state model

Figure 4. Gender and COVID-19 transitions
Estimated hazard ratios for male gender (relative to female) from cause-specific Cox models
for each transition. Points give estimated hazard ratios, with lines representing 95%
confidence intervals.

Figure 5. Comorbidities and COVID-19 transitions
Estimated hazard ratios for comorbidities of interest from cause-specific Cox models for each transition. Points give estimated hazard ratios,
with lines representing 95% confidence intervals. Models were estimated separately for each comorbidity of interest, with adjustment for age
and gender.
