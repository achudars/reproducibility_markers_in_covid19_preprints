Abstract
The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created high
demand for medical resources, including personnel, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators. As
thousands of patients are hospitalized, the disease has shown remarkable diversity in its
manifestation; many patients with mild to no symptoms recover from the disease requiring
minimal care, but some patients with severe disease progression require mechanical ventilation
support in intensive care units (ICU) with an increased risk of death. Studying the characteristics
of patients in these various strata can help us understand the varied progression of this disease,
enable earlier interventions for at-risk patients, and help manage medical resources more
efficiently. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of 10,123 COVID-19 patients treated at
the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, including their demographics, symptoms,
comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical history. Specifically, we present a staging
scheme based on discrete clinical events (i.e., admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU,
mechanical ventilation, and death), and investigate the temporal trend of clinical variables and the
effect of comorbidities in each of those stages. We then developed a prognostic model to predict
ventilation demands at an individual patient level by analyzing baseline clinical variables, which
entails (1) a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and a decision
tree model to identify predictors for mechanical ventilation; and (2) a logistic regression model
based on these risk factors to predict which patients will eventually need ventilatory support. Our
results indicate that the prognostic model achieves an AUC of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.765–0.880) in
identifying patients who will eventually require mechanical ventilation.

Introduction
Since the emergence of COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China [1], a global pandemic
has ensued [2], and widespread, sustained transmission has been observed worldwide. As of this
writing, the virus has infected ~63 million people and caused over 1.4 million deaths worldwide,
including over 13.75 million cases and over 273,000 deaths in the United States.
Studies have been published of the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in
Chinese cities such as Wuhan [3], Shanghai [4], and Chongqing [5], as well as New York City
[6,7]. These studies suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major driver of
high mortality rates among critically ill patients. Several potentially impactful interventions have
been found to reduce the severity of the illness and improve outcomes among critically ill patients
with COVID-19: 1) early prone positioning (before intubation), which improves oxygenation and
reduces the need for mechanical ventilation [8–10]; 2) Remdesivir therapy, when given to those
requiring supplemental oxygen, can reduce recovery time [11]; and 3) dexamethasone, a frequent
adjunctive therapy for ARDS and sepsis, has been found to reduce mortality among those with
COVID-19 and respiratory compromise [12]. Those findings suggest the importance of early
identification of ARDS as part of an overall COVID-19 treatment plan. Therefore, there is a critical
need for a tool that can identify the patients who can benefit from earlier interventions.
In this single-center study conducted at the highest-volume clinical center for COVID-19
in the state of Illinois, we characterized the evolution of infections, risk factors for infection, and
predictors of severe illness (i.e., ARDS), using a multistage analytic approach. Using LASSO
regression and decision tree algorithms, we identified the key risk factors that predicted the need
for mechanical ventilation from past data. Finally, we developed an early warning system for
identifying those at high risk for requiring mechanical ventilation using the identified risk factors.

An important aspect of the machine learning-based model is its ability to individualize a prediction
based on features that are readily available upon hospital admission.
Although recently published comprehensive studies from China address disease
progression, our study is unique as it focuses on the United States. We note that work in other
urban areas of the United States (i.e., New York and Los Angeles) has found strong differences in
severe illness onset and outcomes across racial and ethnic groups [13–22]. In that context, our
research focuses specifically on the population of Chicago, Illinois, which has a diverse and unique
urban patient population.

Methods
The overall flow of our analysis is illustrated in Figure 1. Our analysis included 10,123
COVID-19 patients for whom information on demographics and initial symptoms was available.
Among these patients, 1,788 were admitted to the hospital; for them, additional longitudinal
information, such as lab test results and vitals, was available. Among the hospitalized patients, 301
had most of their lab measures and vitals collected on the day of admission. We used data collected
from those patients to develop and validate the prediction model in a retrospective fashion. Out of
the 301 investigated patients, 96 required ventilation. The predictive was developed in two steps:
(1) we used a LASSO regression and a decision tree model to identify top risk factors for
mechanical ventilation; and (2) we developed a logistic regression model based on these risk
factors to predict which patients would eventually need ventilatory support.

Data was collected at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, and cover the
COVID-19 patients registered between 03/17/2020 and 08/07/2020. Information on patients and
treatments was obtained from queries against data warehouses populated from regular exports of
clinical data stored in Rush’s Epic electronic medical record (EMR) system. The study included
10,123 patients with COVID-19, and their EMRs were retrospectively processed to extract the
patients’ demographics (Table 1), laboratory findings, vitals (Table 2), and comorbidities (Table
3). The age of each patient was typically documented as a numerical value, but for 41 patients
whose ages were documented by the text “90+”, we assigned an age of 90 for use in our analysis.
Variables
The variables investigated in our study include the patients’ demographics, laboratory
findings, vitals, and comorbidities as collected in the hospital. Demographic variables include
patients’ age, sex, first race, and smoking status. Laboratory findings include white blood count,
absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, absolute monocyte count, neutrophils
percentage, lymphocyte percentage, monocyte percentage, albumin, aspartate transaminase,
alanine transaminase, d-dimer, red blood count , blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hemoglobin,
ferritin, d-dimer, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, blood glucose, platelet count, and
creatine phosphokinase. Vitals include oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, respiration
rate, and pulse. Comorbidities include hypertension, overweight condition or obesity, type 2
diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic ischemic heart disease.
Definition of Stages
We defined the stages of disease progression based on clinical events; data on such clinical
events can be used by hospitals to allocate medical resources. In our study, we defined (1)
hospitalization, (2) admission to ICU, (3) mechanical ventilation, and (4) death as the advancing

stages of COVID-19 disease progression. Figure 2 presents the transition of COVID-19-infected
individuals across those stages. As shown in the figure, 10,123 individuals tested positive for
COVID-19. Among them, 1,788 were treated in the hospital. The patients who suffered more
severe disease progression were treated in the ICU and received ventilatory support, depending on
the severity of their disease. 684 (38.3%) of the patients admitted to the hospital were treated in
the ICU, and of those in the ICU, 380 (55.6%) received ventilation support. 155 ventilated patients
died from COVID-19.
Analysis of risk factors
LASSO regression [23] was used to select the most discriminative variables for predicting
the demand for mechanical ventilation. The “glmnet” packet in R was used to compute the results
[24]. A total of 18 variables were entered in an L1-norm LASSO regression. They include age,
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte percentages; white blood,
red blood, and platelet counts; and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, blood
glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, albumin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase,
hemoglobin, and SpO2. As the regularization term (typically denoted as λ) grows large, only the
most important features are left with nonzero coefficients.
In addition to performing a LASSO regression, we also constructed a decision tree [25] for
the investigated variables, which. provides another perspective that can be used to identify key risk
factors. Using the Gini Index as the impurity metric [26], the decision tree iteratively splits the
current data into two branches. By definition, the variable used for splitting the root node is the
most discriminative factor. Furthermore, the key risk factors tend to gather at the high-layer nodes
near the root. The key risk factors selected by the LASSO regression and decision tree algorithms

were further compared and entered in the logistic regression model for predicting ventilator
demands.
Model training and evaluation
We chose to use logistic regression to build the prediction model because an easily
interpretable predictive model can help facilitate rapid clinical translation [27]. The key risk factors
we identified were used as predictors, and the requirement for ventilation (given as a binary
Yes/No variable) was treated as the output label. The task was to predict the demand for
mechanical ventilation given data collected at admission. Our positive class (ventilated patients)
included 96 patients, and the negative class included 205 patients. The logistic regression classifier
was trained and validated using a standard 10-fold cross-validation approach [28]. The accuracy
of prediction was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC).
The mean AUC and confidence intervals were calculated over all cross-validation splits.

Results

1. Overall demographic, symptomatic, laboratory, and vital characteristics
The demographic information, symptoms, and smoking status of infected patients are
presented in Table 1. With a median age of 40 and the 75th percentile at 54, the patients were
younger than those reported from China [1] and New York [6]. There were more infected females
(53.55%) than males (46.45%). In terms of race, African Americans (32.92%) and Whites
(27.27%) constituted the largest fractions of the infected patients. Cough (70.14%), fever
(46.86%), and shortness of breath (41.32%) were the most common symptoms. In terms of
ethnicity, marginally more Hispanics or Latinos (50.88%) were infected than Non-Hispanics or
Latinos (49.12%). People who had never smoked (76.42%) and former smokers (16.18%)

accounted for most of the infected patients; Current smokers accounted for only 7.4%. The ages
of the infected patients are presented in Figure 3(a), which represents data from 03/17/2020 and
after. The interquartile range (IQR) of age is represented by the shaded region. The median age
decreased from 46 (in week 0) to 37 (in week 20), indicating the spread of disease to a younger
population. The number of clinical events, including hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and
mortalities, are presented in Figure 3(b). The peak of hospital admissions was reached at week 5;
however, the peak of ICU admissions was reached at week 1. The peak of mortality was reached
at week 7. Week 7 (which ended on 05/05/2020) was a turning point in the number of hospital
admissions, indicating a reduction in transmission of COVID-19 in the Chicago area. However, a
second wave of infections is suggested by the increase in hospital admissions from week 14 to
week 19.
Table 2 presents the laboratory measures and vitals of hospitalized patients on the day of
admission. Among all the investigated laboratory measures, the lymphocyte percentage (median
16.3, IQR 10.6–23.2) and albumin (median 3.3, IQR 3.0–3.7) were lower than the normal range,
while ferritin (median 766.2, IQR 325.9–1643.0), d-dimer (median 0.9, IQR 0.5–2.5), C-reactive
protein (median 112.1, IQR 54.5–192.8), lactate dehydrogenase (median 404.0, IQR 304.0–544.0),
and blood glucose (median 122.0, IQR 103.0–175.0) were higher than the normal range. Among
vital signs, the respiratory rate (median 20.6, IQR 18.6–24.0)) was slightly higher than the normal
range.
Figure 4 presents the temporal changes in laboratory features, covering 15 days after
hospital admission. To reduce the appearance of the same patients in multiple groups, we classified
the patients into four groups: hospitalized but not in the ICU; in the ICU but not ventilated;
ventilated but not deceased; and deceased. The albumin level of all patient groups decreased from

day 0 to day 7. During that time, the albumin levels of the ventilated patients who ultimately
survived behaved much like those patients who subsequently died. However, the albumin levels
of the eventual survivors then began to increase, while the albumin levels of those who
subsequently died continued to decrease until day 11. The blood urea nitrogen level of the patients
who eventually died kept increasing until death and was generally higher than the level found in
other groups of patients. The lymphocyte percentages of ICU-but-never-ventilated patients tended
to move from the abnormal range (<18%) to the normal range, while the lymphocyte percentages
of patients who eventually died tended to worsen. That correlation means that the lymphocyte
percentage can be used as an indicator of a patient’s condition. A rising lymphocyte percentage
indicates a recovery trend in a COVID-19 patient, while a decreasing lymphocyte percentage
indicates a worsening condition. As for the red blood count, the initial values for patients who later
died were in roughly the same range as those of survivor groups those of survivor groups, but later
the value for patients who died showed a sharper decrease compared with the survivors. Thus, the
initial value for the red blood count may not be a risk factor for mortality prediction, but its
downward trend can be used to forecast deterioration.
2. The impact of comorbidities on disease progression
We investigated five comorbidities for COVID-19 patients. Ranked by their rates of
appearance among the hospitalized patients, they include hypertension (60.29%), overweight or
obese condition (57.1%), type 2 diabetes (43.12%), chronic kidney disease (23.04%), and chronic
ischemic heart disease (18.06%). As COVID-19 progressed from the hospitalization stage to the
ICU stage to eventual death, the percentage of patients who had chronic kidney disease or chronic
ischemic heart disease constantly increased, indicating that these two comorbidities are significant
risk factors for severe disease progression. In addition, the rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240606; this version posted November 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

were also higher among deceased patients than among the total hospitalized population. The
patients who had none of these five comorbidities and presented as relatively healthy accounted
for very few (14.65%) of the hospitalized patients and even fewer of the deceased patients
(10.71%), meaning that an originally healthy individual is far less likely to suffer serious effects
due to COVID-19. These findings indicate that the studied comorbidities are risk factors for
mortality.
3. Risk factors of severe disease progression and predicting ventilation demand
Figure 5(a) shows the trace of coefficients as the λ grows large. The coefficients of
investigated features turn to 0 sequentially. Among all the features, albumin is the last one that
turns to 0, meaning that albumin is the most discriminative feature selected by LASSO, followed
by SpO2 and white blood count. The significance of albumin is also indicated by the magnitudes
of coefficients; the coefficient of albumin is consistently larger than that of any other feature.
Albumin can be considered a general measure of an individual’s overall health. Figure 5(b) shows
the trace of binomial deviance, a type of misclassification error [29]. As the regularization
parameter λ becomes large, the binomial deviance first decreases and then increases. The axis
above the figure shows the number of nonzero coefficients at a particular λ value. The minimal
deviance is achieved with 12 features. They include age, platelet count, white blood count,
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte percentage, and the levels of lactate dehydrogenase,
C-reactive protein, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, hemoglobin, and SpO2.
Using the 12 features selected by LASSO regression, we achieved an AUC of 0.819
(95%CI: 0.751–0.888) using a logistic regression approach. To identify the most discriminative
features, we used the decision tree algorithm with the Gini Index. Figure 6 shows the result of the
decision tree with max layer = 3. The first split is made on albumin = 2.65 g/dl. For the patients

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.29.20240606; this version posted November 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

with albumin lower than 2.65 g/dl, the second split is made on the white blood count = 6.835 k/ul,
indicating that the patients with low albumin and high white blood count are more likely to require
mechanical ventilation. Whereas, for the patients with albumin higher than 2.65 g/dl, the second
split is made on SpO2 = 92.739%, indicating that the patients with high albumin and high SpO2
values are less likely to need ventilatory support. The top three features selected by the decision
tree algorithm exactly match those selected by LASSO regression, highlighting the significance of
these features. In clinical practice, this compact set of features may be used to efficiently triage
COVID-19 patients. We trained another logistic regression model with these three features alone
and achieved an AUC of 0.823 (95%CI: 0.765–0.880), which is marginally higher than the AUC
achieved using all 12 features.
We selected a cutpoint of the prediction model by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and
specificity, which is also formally equivalent to maximizing Youden’s Index [30]. Such a criterion
is desirable in clinical setting for it maximizes the overall correct classification rate and thus reduce
the overall misdiagnosis rate. We performed a grid search by varying the cutpoint from 0 to 1 with
an interval of 0.05. The maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity was achieved at the cutpoint of
0.35, where sensitivity = 0.70 and specificity = 0.82.

Discussion
This paper presents a novel approach for triaging COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting
to predict the need for mechanical ventilation. We created the approach using a multi-stage
perspective in a retrospective manner. Our data are unique in that they came from a large
metropolitan hospital with an extremely diverse patient population. We characterized the
stratification of COVID-19 patients in terms of clinical events and presented laboratory measures
in both static and dynamic views, thereby making it easier to understand and track disease

progression. We used LASSO regression and decision tree models to identify several risk factors
for deterioration of patient health. Using those identified risk factors, we developed a logistic
regression-based prediction model that can identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. With
a cutpoint of 0.35, the model performed well with a positive predictive value of 0.644. At Rush,
the use of this model would have correctly identified 67 (out of 96) patients who would require
ventilation support, with 37 false positives (out of the 205 patients who did not require ventilation
support).
This research and the resulting model establish the feasibility of an early triaging tool that
can predict the clinical course of COVID-19 at a subject-specific level. This not only has the
potential to improve patient outcomes, but also can provide hospital administrations with insights
that inform resource management.
Several other previously published modeling approaches have attempted to evaluate
predictors of clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation, and death. Factors associated with
disease progression in non-peer-reviewed work include lower platelet and lymphocyte counts;
increased markers of DIC, such as fibrinogen, d-dimer, and aPTT; increased LDH, AST, and CK,
and abnormal CT scans [31]; clinical comorbidities, CRP, respiratory rate, and LDH [32]; and
higher SOFA score, age, and d-dimer levels [33]. One non-peer-reviewed study found similar
factors and developed a nomogram for prediction [34]. In a peer-reviewed study, clinical
comorbidities were the most predictive for severe disease progression [35]. Our work has
identified three critical indicators of the deterioration of COVID-19 patients, namely albumin,
SpO2, and white blood count, which are readily measurable in a clinical setting.

Future work with this model will implement an early warning system for clinical disease
progression. The value of using an approach that recognizes respiratory compromise is that it can
identify patients for whom early intervention can improve outcomes. With the insights gleaned
from emerging clinical data, the use of optimized prone positions, medical therapy with antivirals,
and anti-inflammatory medication may abbreviate the inflammatory response, improve
oxygenation, reduce the risk of intubation, and reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19. An
approach like the one introduced in this paper can also identify patients for whom early discharge
is safe. A triage tool for sorting high- vs. low-risk individuals with COVID-19 would be highly
useful in resource-constrained situations in which bed capacity must be tightly managed.
Our study is subject to several limitations. It is a single-center study, and practice patterns
in that center may not generalize to other centers. In addition, we did not include radiography in
the predictive model. Future studies will continue refining the model and validate its performance
prospectively.

Figure 1 Overall flow of the analysis and the data: Our analysis included 10,123 COVID-19 patients,
1,788 of whom were admitted to the hospital. Among the hospitalized patients, 301 had most of their lab
measures and vitals collected on the day of admission. We used their data to develop and validate the
prediction model in a retrospective fashion. We developed the predictive model in two steps: (1) we used
a LASSO regression and a decision tree model to identify key risk factors for mechanical ventilation; and
(2) we developed a logistic regression model based on these risk factors to predict the need for ventilation
support at a patient level.

Figure 2 Transitions of patients between stages. 10,123 individuals tested positive for COVID-19.
Among them, 1,788 were treated in the hospital. The patients who suffered more severe disease
progression were treated in the ICU and some were ventilated, depending on the severity of their disease.
684 (38.3%) of the patients admitted to the hospital were treated in the ICU, and of those in the ICU, 380
(55.6%) received ventilation support. 155 ventilated patients died from COVID-19.

Figure 6 Decision tree for distinguishing between patients who did and did not require ventilation.
A maximum tree depth of 3 and the Gini impurity index were utilized to derive the decision tree. The first
split is made on albumin = 2.65 g/dl. For the patients with albumin lower than 2.65 g/dl, the second split
is made on the white blood count = 6.835 k/ul. Whereas, for the patients with albumin higher than 2.65
g/dl, the second split is made on SpO2 = 92.739%.
