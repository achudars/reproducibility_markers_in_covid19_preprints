Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a major global threat that has
already caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide. It is characterized by distinct
patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However,
the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity
remain so far poorly known.
Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth
phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine
quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease
severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence
of anti-inflammatory therapy.
Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It
consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a
low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferonstimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an
exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional
factor NFκB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune
chemokines.
Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of
severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study
provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted antiinflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF-α in most severe patients. These data
also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.

Introduction
Early clinical descriptions of the first SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (Covid19) cases at the end of 2019 rapidly highlighted distinct patterns of disease
progression1. Although most patients experience mild-to-moderate disease, 10 to
20% progress to severe or critical disease, including pneumonia and acute
respiratory failure2. Based on data from patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19
from mainland China, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical
ventilation or death occurred in 6.1%of cases1. This proportion of critical cases is
higher than that estimated for seasonal Influenza3. Additionally, relatively high rates
of respiratory failure were reported in young adults (aged 50 years and lower) with
previously mild comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight)4. In
severe cases, clinical observations typically describe a two-step disease progression,
starting with a mild-to-moderate presentation followed by a secondary respiratory
worsening 9 to 12 days after onset of first symptoms2,5,6. Respiratory deterioration is
concomitant with extension of ground-glass lung opacities on chest computed
tomography (CT) scans, lymphocytopenia, high prothrombin time and D-dimer
levels2. This biphasic evolution marked by a dramatic increase of acute phase
reactants in the blood suggests a dysregulated inflammatory host response resulting
in an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. This leads to the
subsequent recruitment and accumulation of leukocytes in tissues causing acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)7. However, little is known about the
immunological features and the molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity.
To test the hypothesis of a virally-driven hyperinflammation leading to severe
disease, we employed an integrative approach based on clinical and biological data,

Patients and methods
Study participants
Fifty patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance and
positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing on a respiratory sample (nasopharyngeal
swab or invasive respiratory sample) were included in this non-interventional study.
Inpatients with pre-existing unstable chronic disorders (such as uncontrolled diabetes
mellitus, severe obesity defined as body mass index greater than 30, unstable
chronic respiratory disease or chronic heart disease) were excluded. Since median
duration from onset of symptoms to respiratory failure was previously shown to be
9.5 (interquartile range, 7.0-12.5) days8, we analyzed immune signatures between 8
to 12 days after first symptoms for all patients and before the initiation of any antiinflammatory treatment. Healthy controls were asymptomatic adults, matched with
cases on age and with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing at time of inclusion.
The study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and
received approval by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (Cochin-Port Royal
Hospital, Paris, France).
The severity of COVID-19 was classified based on the adaptation of the Sixth
Revised Trial Version of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment
Guidance. Mild cases were defined as mild clinical symptoms (fever, myalgia,
fatigue, diarrhea) and no sign of pneumonia on thoracic computed tomography (CT)
scan. Moderate cases were defined as clinical symptoms associated with dyspnea
and radiological findings of pneumonia on thoracic CT scan, and requiring a
maximum of 3 L/min of oxygen. Severe cases were defined as respiratory distress
requiring more than 3 L/min of oxygen and no other organ failure. Critical cases were
defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock and/or other

organ failure necessitating intensive care unit (ICU) cares. Further details of the
methods used are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Results
Peripheral blood leukocytes phenotyping
Patients’ characteristics are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix and depicted
in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. As reported in previous studies9,10,
lymphocytopenia correlates with disease severity (Figure 1A). To further
characterize it, we used mass cytometry and performed Visualization of t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (viSNE)11 to compare cell population densities
according to disease severity (Figure 1B). viSNE representation and differentiated
cell counts showed a decrease in the density of NK cells and CD3+ T cells, including
all T cell subsets but more pronounced for CD8+ T cells. This phenotype was more
prominent in severe and critical patients, contrasting with an increase in the density
of B cells and monocytes (Figure 1C-F). No major imbalance in CD4+ and CD8+ T
cell naïve/memory subset was observed (Supplementary Figure 2). Data on T cell
polarization and other minor T cell subsets are indicated in Supplementary Figure
3. Plasmablasts were enriched in infected patients (Figure 1F), as supported by the
increase in genes associated with B cell activation and plasmablast differentiation,
such as IL4R, TNFSF13B and XBP1 (Supplementary Figure 4).
We then assessed the functional status of specific T cell subsets and NK cells using
markers of activation (CD25, CD38, HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD-1, Tim-3)
(Supplementary Figure 5A). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations were
characterized by an increase in CD38+ HLA-DR+ activated T cells in infected
patients, with an expression of PD-1 modestly increasing with disease severity
(Figure 1G, Supplementary Figure 5B). A similar increase in activated NK cells

was found in infected patients, especially critical patients, and NK cells displayed a
significant increase in Tim-3 expression (Figure 1G). Furthermore, expression of
exhaustion-related genes, such as BATF, IRF4 and CD274, significantly increased
with disease severity (Supplementary Figure 5C).
Finally, high annexin-V expression by flow cytometry and upregulation of apoptosisrelated genes in the blood from severe and critical patients supported that
lymphocytopenia could be partly explained by increased T cell apoptosis
(Supplementary Figure 6).

Activation of innate and inflammatory pathways in severe and critical cases
To investigate the immunological transcriptional signatures that characterize disease
severity, we quantified the expression of 594 immunology-related genes in blood
cells (Figure 2A). We identified differentially expressed genes as a function of
severity grades (Figure 2B). Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA)
separated patients with high disease severity on principal component 1 (PC1), driven
by inflammatory and innate immune response encoding genes (GSEA enrichment
score with q-value <0.2) (Figure 2C). PC2, that was enriched in genes encoding
proteins involved in both type I and type II interferon (IFN) responses, distinguished
mild-to-moderate patients from the other groups. Collectively, these data suggest a
severity grade-dependent increase in activation of innate and inflammatory
pathways; in contrast, the IFN response is high in mild-to-moderate patients while it
is reduced in more severe patients.

Type I IFNs are essential for antiviral immunity12. Multiplex gene expression analysis
showed an upregulation of genes involved in type I IFN signaling (such as IFNAR1,
JAK1, TYK2) contrasting with a striking downregulation of interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs) (such as MX1, IFITM1, IFIT2) in critical patients (Figure 3A).
Accordingly, ISG score, based on the expression of 6 ISGs defining a type I IFN
signature13, was significantly reduced in critical compared to mild-to-moderate
patients (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 7A). Consistently, plasma levels of IFNα2 protein measured by Simoa digital ELISA14 were significantly lower in critical than
in mild-to-moderate patients (Figure 3C) and correlated with ISG (R2=0.27;
P=0.0005) (Supplementary Figure 7B), while IFN-β was undetectable in all of the
patients (data not shown). To further assess the global type I IFN activity, an in vitro
cytopathic assay was used15. IFN activity in serum was significantly lower in severe
and critical than in mild-to-moderate patients (Figure 3D). Of note, plasmacytoid
dendritic cells, the main source of IFN-α16, were reduced in infected patients
compared to controls, but there was no difference between groups (Figure 3E).
Finally, we evaluated the response of whole blood cells to an IFN-α stimulation. An
increase in ISG score upon IFN-α stimulation was observed, that was similar in
infected patients of any severity and controls (Figure 3F), indicating that the potential
for response to type I IFN was not impacted in critically ill patients. As a possible
consequence of impaired IFN-α production, we observed an increased plasma viral
load, a possible surrogate marker of uncontrolled lung infection, in severe and critical
compared to mild-to-moderate patients, while viral load in nasal swabs was
comparable between groups (Figure 3G). Overall, these data suggest that patients
with severe and critical Covid-19 have an impaired type I IFN production and a lower
viral clearance.

Dissecting the mechanisms of hyperinflammation in severe and critical
patients
Severe Covid-19 was reported to induce a cytokine storm7,17. Cytokine and
chemokine-related genes were found to be increasingly expressed as a function of
disease severity in the study cohort (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 8A).
Interestingly, cytokine whole blood RNA levels did not always correlate with protein
plasma levels. IL-6, a key player of the cytokine storm in Covid-1918, was not
detected in peripheral blood at the transcriptional level (Supplementary Figure 8B),
contrasting with high levels of IL-6 protein (Figure 4B). Expression of IL-6-induced
genes,

such

as

IL6R,

SOCS3

and

STAT3

were

significantly

increased

(Supplementary Figure 8B) reflecting the activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway.
TNF-α, a key driver of inflammation, was only moderately upregulated at the
transcriptional level (Supplementary Figure 8C), whereas circulating TNF-α was
significantly increased (Figure 4C). Accordingly, TNF pathway-related genes were
also upregulated, including TNFSF10 (Supplementary Figure 8D-E), supporting an
important role for TNF-α in the induction of inflammation. The discrepancy between
RNA quantification and protein measurement suggests that cellular sources of TNF-α
and IL-6 originated more likely from the injured lungs and/or endothelial cells.
Conversely, while IL1B transcripts were significantly upregulated (Supplementary
Figure 8F), the active form of IL-1β protein was low (Figure 4D), suggesting that proIL-1β was poorly cleaved and secreted, and that inflammasome activation could not
be the main player in the cytokine storm. Circulating IL-1α was also not detected
(data not shown). These findings contrast with the detection of high levels of
circulating IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and upregulation of IL1R1 transcripts,

indicating an active antagonism of IL-1 in critically ill patients (Supplementary
Figure 8F). We also detected IL10 transcripts and IL-10 protein in both severe and
critically ill patients (Figure 4E, Supplementary Figure 8G). In contrast, no increase
of IFN-γ and IL-17A proteins was detected in severe patients (Supplementary
Figure 9).
We explored the expression of transcription factors that may drive this exacerbated
inflammation and found that genes specifically upregulated in most of severe and
critical ill patients mostly belonged to the NFκB pathway (Figure 4F, Supplementary
Figure 10). Aberrant NFκB activation can result, among several triggering pathways,
from excessive innate immune sensors activation by pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) (e.g. viral RNA) and/or damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) (e.g. released by necrotic cells and tissue damage). Interestingly, LDH, a
marker

of

necrosis

and

cellular

injury,

correlated

disease

severity

(Supplementary Figure 1C), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-3, a key
kinase involved in programmed necrosis and inflammatory cell death, was also
significantly elevated in severe and critically ill patients (Figure 4G) and correlated
with LDH (R2=0.47; P<0.0001).
The cytokine storm has been associated with massive influx of innate immune cells,
namely neutrophils and monocytes, which may aggravate lung injury and precipitate
ARDS19. We therefore analyzed expression of chemokines and chemokines
receptors involved in the trafficking of innate immune cells (Figure 4A). While the
neutrophil chemokine CXCL2 was detected in the serum but with no difference
between groups, its receptor CXCR2 was significantly upregulated in severe and
critical patients (Figure 4H). Accordingly, severe disease was accompanied with
higher neutrophilia. Monocyte chemotactic factor CCL2 was increased in the blood of

infected patients, as well as the transcripts of its receptor CCR2 and was associated
with low circulating inflammatory monocytes (Figure 4I), suggesting a role for the
CCL2/CCR2 axis in the monocyte chemoattraction into the inflamed lungs. These
observations are in accordance with recently published studies in bronchoalveolar
fluids from Covid-19 patients, describing the key role of monocytes19. Overall, these
results support a framework whereby an ongoing inflammatory cascade, initiated by
impaired type I IFN production, may be fueled by both PAMPs and DAMPs.

Discussion
In this study, we identified an impaired type I IFN response associated with
high blood viral load in severe and critical Covid-19 patients, that inversely correlated
with an excessive NFκB-driven inflammatory response associated with increased
TNF-α and IL-6.
Innate immune sensors, such as TLRs and RIG-I-like receptors, play a key
role in controlling RNA virus by sensing viral replication and by alerting the immune
system through the expression of a diverse set of antiviral genes20. Type I IFNs,
which include IFN-α, β and ω, are hence rapidly induced and orchestrate a
coordinated antiviral program21 via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and expression
of ISGs21. We herein observed that most severe Covid-19 patients displayed a lower
viral clearance possibly caused by an impaired type I IFN production while cellular
response to stimulation was preserved. Further longitudinal studies will be necessary
to assess in severe and critical patients whether reduced IFN production is present
since the onset of infection, whether the peak is delayed, or whether IFN production
is exhausted after an initial peak. SARS-CoV2 may have evolved efficient
mechanisms to evade host innate immune pathways. Supporting this hypothesis, it
was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a higher replication rate and a
lower induction of host interferon in comparison to SARS-CoV-122. Moreover, virulent
human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to encode multiple
structural and non-structural proteins that antagonize IFN and ISG responses,
notably by inhibiting the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-dependent phosphorylation
and activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IFN production23–26.
Coronaviruses can also inhibit multiple stages of translational initiation27. Several
hypotheses may be proposed to explain interindividual variability in IFN response to

infection. Comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight) are risk
factors for severe Covid-19 and could negatively impact IFN production as well as
exacerbate inflammatory responses28–30. Genetic host susceptibility can be also
suspected since inherited monogenic disorders in children31,32 or susceptibility
variants in adults33, each involving the type I IFN pathway, have been associated with
life-threatening influenza infections. Identification of patients with insufficient IFN
production could define a high-risk population that could benefit from IFN-α or -β
supplementation in conjunction with antiviral drugs when available.

Alternatively,

IFN-λ (Type III interferon) could be tested as recently proposed34, as the receptor is
more specifically localized on epithelial cells, which may avoid potential systemic side
effects with type I IFN. Conversely, inhibiting IFN production could be deleterious in
these patients, reason why agents interfering with the IFN pathway, such as
corticosteroids, anti-interferon antibody, JAK1/Tyk2 inhibitors or chloroquine, should
be considered with great caution.
Viral replication within the lungs in conjunction with an increased influx of
innate immune cells mediates tissue damage and may fuel an auto-amplification
inflammatory loop, potentially driven by NFκB, and ultimately leading to ARDS and
respiratory failure. Interestingly, virulent human coronaviruses have been shown to
promote multiple form of necrotic cell death such as RIPK3-dependent necroptosis
and caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis35. These pathways have also been implicated
in influenza-induced ARDS in mice and humans36,37. Therefore, inflammatory cell
death (e.g. necroptosis or pyroptosis) may represent an upstream driver of
inflammation that could be targeted38.
Our study confirmed that IL-6 plays an important role in pathogenesis and
severity of Covid-19. Based on promising case series39, randomized trials are

currently evaluating the benefits of IL-6 targeted therapy. Our study also provides a
case for the inhibition of the TNF axis. Indeed, TNF is highly expressed in alveolar
macrophages and anti-TNF does not block immune response in animal models of
virus infection40. Moreover, TNF blockade induces a significant IL-6 expression
reduction40. Other targets could also be considered such as chemokines antagonists
that block migration of monocytes and neutrophils to the inflamed lungs.
Based on our study, we propose that type I IFN deficiency is a hallmark of
severe Covid-19 and infer that severe and critical Covid-19 patients could be
potentially relieved from the IFN deficiency by IFN administration and from
exacerbated inflammation by adapted anti-inflammatory therapies targeting IL-6 or
TNF-α.

(A) Lymphocytes count in whole blood from Covid-19 patients was analyzed between
days 8 and 12 after onset of first symptoms, according to disease severity. (B) viSNE
map of blood leukocytes after exclusion of granulocytes, stained with 30 markers and
measured with mass cytometry, and automatically separates cells into spatially
distinct subsets based on the combination of markers that they express. (C) viSNE
map colored by cell density across disease severity - no disease, mild-to-moderate,
severe and critical. Red color represents the highest density of cells. (D) Absolute
number of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and CD3- CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells in
peripheral blood from Covid-19 patients, according to disease severity. (EF) Proportions (frequencies) of lymphocyte subsets. Shown are (E) proportions of
CD3+ T cells among lymphocytes, CD8+ T cells CD3+ among T cells and NK cells
among lymphocytes; (F) proportions of CD19+ B cells among lymphocytes and
CD38hi CD27hi plasmablasts among CD19+ B cells. (G) Analysis of the functional
status of specific T cell subsets and NK cells based on the expression of activation
(CD38, HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD-1, Tim-3) markers. P values were determined
by the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s post-test for multiple group
comparisons with median reported; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
