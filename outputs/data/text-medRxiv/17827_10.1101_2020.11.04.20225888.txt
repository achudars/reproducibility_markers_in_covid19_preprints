Abstract
With its origin estimated around December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the ongoing
2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major global health challenge, resulting in more than
45 million infections and 1.2 million deaths. The demand for scalable, rapid and sensitive
viral diagnostics is thus particularly pressing at present to help contain the rapid spread
of infection and prevent overwhelming the capacity of health systems. While high-income
countries have managed to rapidly expand diagnostic capacities, such is not the case in
resource-limited settings of low- to medium-income countries.
Aiming at developing cost-effective viral load detection systems for point-of-care
COVID-19 diagnostics in resource-limited and resource-rich settings alike, we report the
development of an integrated modular centrifugal microfluidic platform to perform loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of viral RNA directly from heat-inactivated
nasopharyngeal swab samples. The discs were pre-packed with dried n-benzyl-nmethylethanolamine modified agarose beads used as a versatile post-nucleic acid
amplification signal enhancement strategy, allowing fluorescence detection via a
smartphone camera and simple optics. The platform provided sample-to-answer analysis
within 1 hour from sample collection and a detection limit between 100 and 1000 RNA
copies in 10 μL reaction volume. Furthermore, direct detection of non-extracted SARSCoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with Ct values below 26
(n=25 plus 6 PCR negative samples) was achieved with ~94% sensitivity and 100%
specificity, thus being fit-for-purpose to diagnose patients with a high risk of viral
transmission. These results show significant promise towards bringing routine point-ofcare COVID-19 diagnostics closer to resource-limited settings.

1. Introduction
Simple, rapid, and sensitive analytical methods for viral detection at the point-ofcare have been increasingly in demand in recent decades. Such devices are especially
relevant in resource-limited settings (RLS) in Africa, Asia and South America, where the
prevalence of ubiquitous viral pathogens such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
and other tropical viruses including Zika, Ebola, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever
(CCHF), Chikungunya and Dengue claim tens of thousands of human lives per year
mostly due to the lack of effective diagnostics and subsequent disease containment and
therapy

1-3

. However, few occasions in modern history have been more pressing for

developments in this field than the present SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic 4 which
from December 2019 to October 2020 has infected more than 45 million people in over
214 countries and territories, resulting in more than 1.2 million deaths. Both these figures
are still growing rapidly.
The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in December 2019 in
Wuhan with a probable zoonotic origin considering its genome sequence is closely related
to bat coronaviruses 5. Although other human coronaviruses associated with epidemic
outbreaks, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, had a higher mortality rate, the much higher
infectivity and long asymptomatic incubation period associated with SARS-CoV-2
infections, resulting in the pathologic condition designated as Corona Virus Disease-19
(COVID-19), allowed the rapid spreading of the virus around the globe 6. In extreme
cases, a detectable viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was observed prior to symptom
onset 7 and as long as 20 days after the first symptoms 6. Furthermore, considering the
significant differences in symptoms and their severity, it is estimated that as many as 90%
of all infections were undocumented early in the pandemic before travel restrictions were
imposed 8.
Aiming at controlling the spread of the virus, millions of viral load tests have been
performed in centralized labs supported by sample collection in the field to screen
symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. The sampling methods of choice are nasal or
throat swabs stored in viral collection medium prior to RT-PCR 9, with primers/probes
targeting the ORF1ab, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E), spike
protein (S) or nucleocapsid (N) genes of the SARS-CoV-2 single stranded RNA genome
10-12

. Viral load values during the course of the infection typically range between ~103 to

~1011 copies/mL 6,7,9,13 and > 106 copies/mL are common early upon the onset of symptoms

, with a peak in the order of 109 copies per throat swab on day 4 after onset of symptoms

14

. However, in the context of viral viability and risk of transmission, it has been observed

that the probability of isolating infectious SARS-CoV-2 is less than 5% when the viral
load in the respiratory tract is below ~4.3x106 RNA copies/mL 15. Thus, it has been
recently advocated that more frequent and cost effective testing with lower sensitivity,
instead of lengthy and sparse PCR testing in centralized labs, can provide a more efficient
strategy for containment by (1) rapidly detecting the viral load peak early upon infection
and (2) avoiding unnecessary isolation during the long viral load decrease period
detectable only with high analytical sensitivity and with minimal to zero risk of crosshuman infection 16. In this context, it is expected that nucleic acid amplification tests can
still provide higher sensitivity and potentially specificity than antigen rapid tests 17, thus
being the ideal solution if costs and equipment complexity can be kept low.
Within the landscape of the ongoing pandemic, it has become clear that testing is
paramount to reduce the spread of infection and ease the impact on health systems
combined with a smart and data-driven management of social distancing policies.
However, while developed countries can economically and logistically support an
exponential increase in lab-based testing and social distancing measures, such a course of
action is hardly feasible in RLS 18. Thus, to support routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics on
a global scale but particularly in RLS, a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, portable and
simple to use device to detect RNA directly from biological specimens would have a
significant impact.
Concerning the development of portable analytical devices, the use of RT-PCR is
suboptimal considering the intrinsic technical complexity of performing several precise
heating-cooling cycles up to >94 °C 19. Thus, in the context of pathogen detection, several
groups have been actively exploring the use of loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) as a potential alternative, requiring only a constant and relatively lower
temperature of ~65 °C 19. Concerning the miniaturization of LAMP towards integrated
analytical platforms, its combination with centrifugal microfluidics

20-24

and/or

smartphone-based signal readout 25-32 has been showing significant promise to achieve a
true sample-to-answer operation. A few remarkable examples of LAMP-based
miniaturized modules using either of these approaches are: (1) capture of LAMP
amplification products with anti-DIG antibodies followed by generation of a TMB
precipitate measured using a standard light source and a smartphone camera 25; (2) digital
microfluidic platform with temperature monitoring/control provided by a thermal

Here, LAMP, centrifugal microfluidics, smartphone-based detection and recent
developments in RT-LAMP applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

33-39

are

combined to develop a novel cost-effective and fully integrated platform for COVID-19
diagnostics directly from heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal samples. The direct detection
from heat-inactivated samples was achieved using (1) a one-pot combination of reverse
transcriptase and polymerase enzymes for robust isothermal amplification and (2) a novel
agarose bead-based signal enhancement strategy for improved fluorometric detection,
thus avoiding the impact of collection media on weakly-buffered pH responsive
colorimetric amplification mixtures 39.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Characterization of RT-LAMP sensitivity and development of a bead-based
strategy for fluorescence signal enhancement
Considerable advances in LAMP-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have
been achieved since the beginning of the pandemic, with several primer sets and potential
detection strategies being reported in the past 6 months. In this context, particular
attention has been given to pH-based colorimetric signal transduction considering the
simple visual interpretation of the results 39. However, mildly buffered systems are highly
prone to interference from different biological samples and collection media, typically

requiring a previous silica-based extraction and elution with DI-water for improved
robustness 39. Fluorescence detection using DNA intercalator dyes is an equally simple
and more interference-forgiving approach but requires the tackling of two key limitations,
namely (1) the relatively more complex signal transduction, particularly in miniaturized
systems concerning low fluorescence signal intensities and filtering requirements 40 and
(2) the high numbers (typically 6 different sequences) and design complexity of LAMP
primers results very often in a variable degree of intra- (hairpins) and cross-primer
hybridization (primer dimers), which result in significant non-specific fluorescence signal
41

. This signal is particularly relevant at room temperature due to the lower hybridization

stringency, hindering a simple, non-real-time, post-LAMP measurement. Here, the
developed device incorporates an agarose bead-based strategy combined with centrifugal
microfluidics to fundamentally tackle both these limitations by significantly enhancing
the negative-to-positive signal ratio. Using a set of primers that we have previously
developed 33 and resorting to a combination of SSIV and Bst 3.0 for LAMP and SYBR
Green I for fluorescence generation, the obtained RT-LAMP results are shown in Figure
1-A. Performing a dilution series of an RNA fragment with a 226 bp sequence matching
the ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 in water, 100 copies per 10 μL reaction could be detected
within 30 min of amplification time, in agreement with the typical LoD requirements of
FDA-approved COVID-19 diagnostic technologies 4. Strikingly, while the increase in
fluorescence signal magnitude from negative to positive measured at 65 °C was about 5fold, the difference was reduced to ~1.5-fold at room temperature (~25 °C) due to an
increase in signal in the non-amplified samples. This background, arising from the
increased hybridization of primer dimers/hairpins at lower temperatures, was addressed
using the novel bead-based sample processing strategy described in Figures 1-B and 1C. This strategy dramatically improved the signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature, thus
facilitating signal acquisition when portability and cost reduction are a priority.
Multimodal ligands as is the case of N-benzyl-N-methylethanolamine (NBNM)
combining anion exchange and other interactions, i.e. hydrophobic and hydrogen
bonding, are typically used in chromatography to capture host cell DNA as an impurity 42
or plasmid DNA as target product 43 directly from complex matrices. Here used for sample
processing, this ligand, when modified on agarose beads with an average porosity of ~
100 nm, was found to have a remarkable selectivity for short oligonucleotides with
lengths of 25-100 bp and a cutoff region between 200-400 bp (Figure 1-B). According
to the results in Figure 1-B, 1.3 μL of beads could deplete virtually all the primers in 10

μL of LAMP mixture (Negative Input vs Negative Output), while the titers of LAMP
products amplified from 106 copies of template RNA remained constant above 400 bp
(Positive Input vs Positive Output). These observations were confirmed using
fluorescence microscopy in the presence of SYBR Green I as dsDNA selective
intercalator. According to the results in Figure 1-C, the primers in a LAMP mixture
without RNA template (Negative) result in a very high fluorescence measured at bead
level, which is ~4.6-fold higher compared to a positive LAMP mixture (103 copies of
RNA template). This observation is in agreement with the electropherograms in Figure
1-B which highlight the complete depletion of all primers (< 50 bp) in the presence of
template (Negative Input vs Positive Input). The fluorescence microscopy measurements
also highlight an increase of ~28-fold in signal magnitude between negative and positive,
comparing the measurement performed directly on solution before bead processing
(upstream of the beads) relative to the measurement performed directly on the beads. Such
an increase in signal magnitude shows promise to implement a robust signal acquisition
strategy with minimal instrumentation complexity. The versatility of the bead-based
enrichment as a general post nucleic acid amplification signal amplification strategy was
further validated for up-concentrating of SARS-CoV-2 PCR amplicons (100 bp long)
detected with a molecular beacon (Figure S1). In agreement with the characterization in
Figure 1-B, the short PCR amplicons were effectively captured within the pores of the
NBNM beads, contrarily to the longer LAMP products, thus generating a linear and
directly proportional correlation between bead fluorescence and RNA copies with Ct
ranging from 25 to 36 (R2 =0.99) (Figure S1). Schematics illustrating the bead capture
behavior in the presence of LAMP or PCR positive and negative samples are shown as
supplementary information (Figure S2).

2.2. Development of an integrated platform for point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostics
using a smartphone camera for fluorometric signal transduction
Aiming at bringing cost-effective, rapid and sensitive COVID-19 diagnostics to
RLS, the main goal of this work was to develop a robust but minimally complex and
portable platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection directly from heat inactivated
biological samples. Taking advantage of the signal enhancement strategy reported in
section 2.1 the concept was based on designing a PMMA disc with 20 independent
channels (Figure 2-A) each comprising (1) a region to perform LAMP of 10 μL sample
(LAMP section), (2) a section containing packed NBNM beads at the interface between

400 and 50 μm deep channels and (3) an outlet chamber (OC) connected to the previous
two components via the narrow 50 μm deep section. To process the sample added to the
disc, the sequence of steps schematized in Figure 2-B was followed. The heat-inactivated
swab sample containing template RNA was mixed with the LAMP reagents and a total
of 10 μL of the mixture was added to the channel, the access holes were sealed and the
whole disc incubated at 65 °C. After amplification, the disc was subjected to four cycles
of ramping the rotation linearly from 0 to 6,000 rpm and vice-versa (1 cycle meaning 06,000-0 rpm). During the ramp-up, the liquid is forced through the beads due to the
centrifugal force and held back by an increase in pressure inside the sealed OC. During
ramp-down, the decrease in centrifugal force allows the OC to decompress pushing the
liquid backwards, while the denser agarose beads are still held in place by the centrifugal
force. This back and forth motion with 4 cycles allows a complete capture of the primers
in solution according to the previous results in Figure 1-B.

outlet chamber (OC), and a top (T) 1 mm PMMA layer with inlet and outlet access holes. B- Sequential operation of
the disc after adding 10 μL of sample. The sequence comprises the (1) sealing of the inlet and outlet holes, (2) LAMP
by heating the disc at 65 °C for 30 minutes, (3) ramping up the rotation speed to 6,000 rpm to force the solution through
the packed beads, followed by a ramp down to 0 rpm, resulting in a backflow of the liquid due to the pressure difference
between the OC (positive pressure) and the LAMP region (negative pressure). The final two steps can be repeated
multiple times to ensure complete capture of the target molecules in solution.

The portable platform developed to combine the centrifugal and heating modules
required to perform the LAMP followed by the bead-based signal enhancement is shown
in Figure 3. The top centrifugal module shown in Figure 3-A uses a DC motor controlled
by a microcontroller board and a hall-effect sensor to complete the rotation protocol. After
the rotation protocol, the measurement is performed through a PMMA lens in the cover
lid covered on the backside with a 100 μm polyimide film which is aligned with the
smartphone camera with a custom-made adapter. The polyimide film serves as emission
absorption filter to block the excitation light from the 450 nm 80 mW laser embedded on
the platform 44. The laser diode is aligned at an angle of ~ 17.5° relative to the disc (Figure
S5) to take advantage of total internal reflection of the PMMA-air interface between the
disc and the lens to minimize residual leakage of blue light into the camera sensor.
The heating module assembled below the centrifugal platform is shown in Figure
3-B. This module comprises a PMMA housing with a removable front piece to insert the
disc. The disc enclosed by the housing is sandwiched in contact with two copper plates
which are actively heated by two resistive silicone mats. The temperature control is
achieved with a feedback loop measuring the temperature between the copper plates and
the heating mats on both sides of the stack. The PMMA housing and the insulating foam
on each side of the heating mats serves to minimize convective and conductive heat
dissipation. To minimize non-specific amplification of hybridized primer dimer and
primer-template pairs at lower temperatures, rapid heating is achieved by initially setting
the temperature of the copper plates at 79 °C according to the plot in Figure 3-B. The
plates are passively cooled down by the disc and active heating is only actuated once the
temperature of the plates decreases below 65 °C.

bottom side of the PMMA lens is covered with a Kapton (polyimide) film working as emission filter. B- Photographs
and schematics of the key components of the heating module. The disc is enclosed in a PMMA housing and in between
two copper plates to maximize the rate of heat transfer and maintain a constant temperature. The starting temperature
of the copper plates (continuously measured between the plates and the heating mats) is set above 65 °C to strike a
balance between maximum heating rate inside the disc channels (38 s to reach 65 °C) while preventing overshooting.

2.3. Characterization of the integrated platform and benchmarking against RTLAMP
The developed platform was subsequently characterized by testing a dilution
series of ORF1ab RNA fragment spiked in DI-water (Figure 4). A dilution series using
the complete platform was tested and the results in Figure 4-A show a limit of detection
between 102-103 copies/reaction (0% positive at 102 copies and 100% positive for 103

copies performing 4 independent measurements for each concentration). The analysis of
the signal in each channel was performed by measuring the grayscale intensity profile of
the green channel (average of 30 pixels) 100 pixels along the interface of the beads and
the solution. Centering the 30x100 pixels line profile at the bead-solution interface
(negative pixel values -50 to 0 in solution and positive values 0 to 50 on the beads), the
response was described as a 10- pixel moving average relative to the intensity of the
solution. A negative/positive decision threshold was defined according to 3.29 times the
standard deviation of the relative signal obtained at the end of the line profile (pixel 50)
for 5 independent negative controls. The obtained sensitivity for the on-disc LAMP was
lower than that obtained in the RT-LAMP tests (Figure 1-A), where 100% of the samples
with 102/copies per reaction showed a positive signal. The relatively lower sensitivity is
hypothesized to arise from non-specific adsorption of enzymes and/or template to the
PMMA channel, having a significantly higher surface area in contact with the 10 μL of
solution compared to a standard reaction tube. Efforts to improve channel passivation
strategies or application of alternative materials are envisioned to maximize performance.
Figure 4-B highlights the enhanced signal (Negative vs 103 copies of target RNA
fragment) provided by the beads. While for the previous fluorescence microscopy
analysis discussed in section 2.1 the focus was placed on the beads and LAMP solution
before processing, the photographs shown here highlight also the complete removal of
non-specific fluorescence signal in solution for the negative control. These observations
support the combination of both types of measurements, i.e. directly on the beads and on
the solution, to allow the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio. The bead-based
primer depletion was also validated as a simultaneous means of inactivating the reaction
post-LAMP, thus avoiding higher temperatures and longer assay times for enzyme
inactivation (Figure 4-C). It was observed that when the primer depletion cycles were
performed before amplification (65 °C for 25 min), no LAMP products were obtained
with initial RNA template titers as high as 109 copies/reaction. Overall these results
confirm the triple functionality of the agarose beads for (1) signal intensity enhancement,
(2) sample preparation to remove non-specific background and (3) simple reaction
inactivation at room temperature.

presence of increasing copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment. The threshold value was calculated as the

considered negative and positive, respectively. B- Enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio in solution provided by the

2.4. Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab
samples
The developed platform was further validated for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
viral RNA directly from heat inactivated (95 °C, 15 min) nasopharyngeal swab samples
collected in two different types of storage media, namely Sigma Virocult® and Sigma
Transwab®. A total of 31 clinical samples summarized in Table 1 were tested and preanalyzed by RT-PCR targeting the E and N genes. All samples were first tested in
duplicate using RT-LAMP and the results are compiled in Figure 5-A. Overall, for the
tested samples, 100% sensitivity and specificity were achieved after 25 min incubation
time, with a positive signal obtained within 20 min for Ct values as high as 27.0 and no
amplification was obtained for the negative samples. Furthermore, a good correlation was

obtained between the Ct values of RT-PCR and the time to positivity (TtP) of RT-LAMP
(Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89). To maximize sensitivity when testing the
samples using the on-chip LAMP, an incubation time of 30 min was necessary as
demonstrated in Figure 5-B. Focusing on a set of 2 samples in each Ct range, i.e. Ct < 15
(V), 15 < Ct < 20 (H), 20 < Ct < 25 (M), Ct > 25 (L) and PCR negative (N), an increase
in amplification time from 25 to 30 min shifted the sensitivity by at least 5 Ct values from
the H to the L range. Longer incubation times were not tested to prevent false positive
signals. The output of the platform for the analysis of all samples listed in Table 1 is
compiled in Figure 5-C. The plotted signals are defined as the signal magnitude measured
50 pixels into the region containing the packed beads relative to the signal measured 50
pixels towards the solution in accordance with the extremes of the profile illustrated in
Figure 5-B. Among the tested samples, 100% sensitivity and specificity were obtained
for samples with Ct values < 25 and ~94% sensitivity/100% specificity including samples
in the high Ct range (L1-L3). Overall, the developed platform allowed the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA with Ct values as high as 26.1 directly for heat-inactivated
nasopharyngeal samples within 40 min from sample inactivation to result.

Figure 5. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in heat inactivated nasopharyngeal swab samples. The samples in Table 1 were
grouped in 5 categories, namely (1) very high – average Ct <15 (red), (2) high – Ct between 20 and 15 (yellow), (3)
medium – Ct between 20 and 25 (green), (4) low – Ct > 25 (blue) and (5) negative (dark blue). Color coding applies to
A, B and C. A- RT-LAMP analysis of clinical samples using a benchtop real-time thermocycler (micPCR). All samples
were measured in duplicate. The inset plot shows the correlation between average PCR Ct value of each sample and
time to positivity (TtP) measured for RT-LAMP. TtP was determined as the required incubation time at 65°C to increase
the fluorescence intensity above the threshold. The threshold was fixed as the highest background fluorescence (before
amplification) measured among all tested samples. B- Analysis a set of 2 samples in each Ct range using the integrated
on-chip platform with an incubation time of 25 or 30 min at 65°C. Scale bars: 5 mm. C- Relative signal measured at
pixel 50 for each nasopharyngeal swab sample. Relative values below the threshold are considered positive for SARSCoV-2 RNA. The threshold and relative signal values in B and C were determined as previously described in section
2.3.

3. Conclusions
We introduce a novel portable bead-based centrifugal microfluidic platform and
demonstrate LAMP based viral RNA detection directly from heat-inactivated
nasopharyngeal swab samples. The platform achieves two major breakthroughs in the
scope of point-of-care viral diagnostics. Firstly, a versatile agarose bead-based strategy
was developed to significantly improve signal transduction after LAMP by removing the
intrinsic background of primer dimer interactions when using intercalating fluorescent
dyes. Secondly, the developed centrifugal and heating modules serve as a complete

package for sample-to-answer analysis directly from heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal
samples in less than 1 hour of total processing time, combined with simple smartphonebased signal acquisition. The limit of detection of ~26 Ct (approximately 1x104-1x105
copies/mL 45) and inexpensive analysis are a suitable combination for frequent screening
to allow detection of the spike in viral load early upon infection and minimize the risk of
transmission 16. In the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the full centrifugal
platform is adaptable to any smartphone, costs less than 200 USD and is compatible with
cost-effective and scalable LAMP reagents under investigation 46. These features can
potentially pave the way to bring routine and scalable diagnostics to RLS, as well as
expanding the current diagnostic capacities in high-income countries by bringing viral
RNA detection directly to the field. Both these avenues are paramount to improve the
containment of viral spread and simultaneously minimize the need for extreme lockdown
policies.

4. Methods
4.1. Fabrication of PDMS microchannels and discs
The PDMS microchannels used for fluorescence microscopy characterization
were fabricated as described in detail elsewhere 47. Briefly, microchannels comprising a
700x100 μm2 cross section converging into a 200x20 μm2 cross-section aimed at trapping
agarose beads with an average diameter of 90 μm, were fabricated using standard SU-8
mold replication techniques. 18-gauge inlet and outlet access holes were punched using
a blunt syringe and the channels were sealed against Corning glass slides after an oxygen
plasma treatment (30 sec, Femto Science CUTE, 100 W, 80 Pa O2).
The discs were designed using Autodesk® Fusion 360 (Education License) and
cut into 1 mm thick PMMA sheets using computer-numerical-control milling machine
(Roland Modela MDX-40A). The disc layers were bonded together using clear medical
grade pressure-sensitive adhesive (ARcare® 92712). The microchannels on pressuresensitive adhesives were cut using a cutter plotter (Graphtec CE6000-40). After aligning
the PMMA layers with the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, the disc was placed in a
manual press machine overnight to ensure uniform bonding. Detailed dimensions of each
microchannel are shown in Figure S3.

4.2. Assembly of the heating module
The heating module consisted of two silicone heater mats (30 W, 150 x 200 mm,
12 V DC; RS PRO Article # 731-366) which were used to heat up 1 mm thick copper
plates (120 mm diameter.). The heater mats are self-adhesive and the copper plates were
attached to the mats. A 4 mm thick PMMA sheet served as a chamber for the heating
module, having a slot, made with a CNC milling machine, to insert the disc. Heater mats
with the attached copper plates in the center were attached on either side of the PMMA
sheet, thus forming a heating chamber for the disc with an open slit on the side for
inserting disc. The thickness of the copper plates and PMMA sheets was chosen to ensure
direct contact with the two copper plates upon insertion of the disc into the chamber.
Finally, the heating chamber was closed to ensure rapid and uniform heating using a
PMMA part cut to fit into the slit opening. The heating module was lined with insulating
foam on either side and placed between two 4 mm thick PMMA sheets (150 x 250 mm)
which were then closed using M6 bolts on the 4 corners. A thermocouple (Type K; RS
PRO Article # 621-2170) was embedded between the copper plate and the heater mat to
measure the temperature. Temperature regulation was achieved by using N-channel
MOSFET (IRF540PBF, 28A, 100V; RS PRO article # 708-5143) in combination with
Arduino UNO Rev 3 MCU Development Board controlling the power supply to the heater
mats.
4.3. Assembly of the centrifugal and signal acquisition modules
The centrifugal module (140 x 230 x 80 mm) was fabricated using 4 mm thick
PMMA sheets which were cut using CNC milling machine and assembled using M3 bolts
and nuts. It consisted of two chambers; the bottom chamber served as the housing for the
electronic components and the top chamber is where the rotation of the disc and the signal
acquisition was done. The control of the whole platform is achieved using an Arduino
UNO Rev 3 MCU Development Board. In the center of the top chamber there was a motor
(Emax MT-2204; 2300 kv brushless DC motor) used to rotate the disc. A small piece of
magnetic tape was attached to the body of the motor and a bipolar hall effect sensor
(Honeywell SS411A; RS Pro Article # 181-1463) was used to measure the rotation speed
in real time while sending feedback to the Arduino board. The top chamber also included
a blue laser diode (Osram Opto PL 450 nm, 80 mW; RS PRo Article # 758-7810) which
was used for signal acquisition. A 16x2 pixel display module attached at the front

provides information to the user regarding ongoing assay steps. Further technical details
and exploded view is shown in Figure S4.
4.4. Packing, drying and characterization of N-benzyl-N-methylethanolamine
(NBNM) agarose beads
The NBNM agarose beads were packed in the discs by first diluting the bead resin
stock (Capto Adhere, Cytiva) in DI-water at 10% (v/v). 20 μL of the diluted bead stock
were then added to each channel on the disc and subsequently centrifuged at 6000 rpm
for 10 s. The excess solution was manually removed from the outlet and the disc was
subsequently placed in a vacuum chamber at 15 Pa for 8 min to dehydrate the beads. After
dehydration, the disc was centrifuged a second time at 6000 rpm for 10 s to ensure a
homogeneous packing. The bp-cutoff of the beads packed inside the discs was
characterized by microfluidic capillary electrophoresis in a Bioanalyzer 2100 system with
a DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies, USA).
The packing in the PDMS microchannels was performed by first preparing a
suspension of beads in a 20% PEG 8000 (w/w) solution by adding 1 μL bead stock to 19
μL PEG solution. The suspension was flowed into the microchannels at 10 μL/min using
a NE-1200 syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, USA). The channels were then rinsed
with DI-water flowed at 10 μL/min for 5 min to ensure removal of any residual PEG and
salts. To dehydrate the beads, the PDMS device was placed in a vacuum chamber at 15
Pa for 5 min and subsequently stored at room temperature until further usage. The beads
inside the PDMS devices were characterized by fluorescence microscopy in a Nikon TiEclipse inverted microscope equipped with a Lumencor SOLA light engine and a FITC
filter cube. The acquired fluorescence microscopy images were analyzed using ImageJ
software (NIH, USA).
4.5. Real-time loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) of SARS-CoV-2
RNA
The RT-LAMP was performed in a Mic qPCR Cycler (Biomolecular systems,
Australia) with a total of 10 μL per reaction mixture. The reaction mixture containing 1
μL template RNA was prepared with final concentrations of 1x Isothermal amplification
buffer II (New England Biolabs, USA), 6 mM dNTPs (RP65, Blirt, Poland), 6 mM
MgSO4 (New England Biolabs, USA), 1x primer mixture (six primers described in detail
below), 1x SYBR Green I (S7585, Thermo Fisher Scientific), 320 mU Bst 3.0 polymerase

(New England Biolabs, USA) and 4 U SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The primer mixture at 10x concentration was prepared with 2 μM F
and B, 16 μM FIP and BIP and 4 μM LF and LB. The primers sequences were the
following: F-5’- CCA CTA GAG GAG CTA CTG TA-3’; B- 5’-TGA CAA GCT ACA
ACA CGT-3’; FIP- 5’-AGG TGA GGG TTT TCT ACA TCA CTA TAT TGG AAC
AAG CAA ATT CTA TGG-3’; BIP- 5’-ATG GGT TGG GAT TAT CCT AAA TGT
GTG CGA GCA AGA ACA AGT G-3’; LF- 5’-CAG TTT TTA ACA TGT TGT GCC
AAC C-3’; LB- 5’-TAG AGC CAT GCC TAA CAT GCT-3’. All primers were
synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The RNA fragment (226 bp) matching the
sequence of the ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 (MT883505.1, 15118-15343) used to
characterize and optimize the LAMP reaction was produced by in-vitro transcription and
stored at -80 °C in DI-water at 5 ng/μL.
4.6. Collection and processing of nasopharyngeal swab samples
We obtained nasopharyngeal samples from Karolinska University Hospital,
Huddinge (Stockholm) collected between May 20th and June 1st 2020. Samples were
collected either using Sigma-Transwab or Sigma-Virocult kits (MWE, UK) as described
in detail elsewhere 46. We used pseudo-anonymized surplus material previously collected
for clinical diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. This is in accordance with the Swedish Act
concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans, which allows
development and improvement of diagnostic assays using patient samples which were
collected to perform the testing in question. Additional ethical approval for RT-LAMP
diagnosis was obtained by the appropriate Swedish Authority (Dnr 2020-01945,
Etikproevningsnaemnden). All samples were pre-analyzed on the GeneXpert Xpress
SARS-CoV-2 system (Cepheid, USA) and Ct values for E and N2 genes were obtained.
For the LAMP experiments, 50 μl of each sample was heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 15
minutes and stored at -80 °C until further processing.
4.7. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the integrated centrifugal platform
The sample containing the RNA template (in vitro synthetized RNA fragment or
inactivated SARS-CoV-2) was first combined with the LAMP master mix at a ratio of
10% (v/v) and 10 μL were subsequently added to each of the 20 channels in the disc. Both
inlet and outlet access holes of all channels were sealed with a sheet of PSA (ARSeal™
90880) covering the entire disc surface. The sealed disc was subsequently inserted into

the heater module and incubated at 65 °C for 25-30 min. The disc was then transferred to
the centrifugal platform and subjected to 4 acceleration/deceleration cycles from 0 to
6,000 rpm taking 1 min each. After centrifugation, the laser diode was turned on and each
channel was sequentially imaged using a mid-range smartphone camera (OnePlus 6T,
China). The acquired RGB images were processed using ImageJ software (NIH, USA)
measuring the grayscale profile of the green channel along the interface between the
solution and the packed beads (100 pixels long and average of 30 pixels perpendicular to
the line). The grayscale intensity on the beads was normalized relative to the solution for
each channel and was smoothed with a 10-pixel moving average before further
processing.

Figure S1. Proof-of-concept of PCR amplicon enrichment on N-benzyl-Nmethylethanolamine beads. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 full genomic RNA (MN908947.3,
Twist Bioscience) was spiked at a total of 50 to 50.000 copies per 25 μL reaction mix
containing 1x TaqMan FAST Virus 1-step MM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.6 μM
forward primer (5’-GTG ARA TGG TCA TGT GTG GCG G-3’), 0.8 μM reverse primer
(5’-CAR ATG TTA AAS ACA CTA TTA GCA TA-3’) and 0.2 uM of molecular beacon
probe 1 (5’-FAM-CAG GTG GAA CCT CAT CAG GAG ATG C-BHQ_1-3’) and 2 (5’FAM-CCA GGT GGW ACR TCA TCM GGT GAT GC-BHQ_1-3’). The mixture was
first incubated for 5 min at 50 °C for reverse transcription, denatured for 20 s at 95 °C
and subjected to a series of 45 cycles of 3 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. The amplification
generates a 100 bp long amplicon. A- RT-PCR with increasing RNA copy numbers in

viral copy titer was measured in quadruplicate. B- Fluorescence intensity measured on
Capto Adhere beads, or solution upstream of the beads after flowing 10 μL of the preamplified mixture (after the 45 amplification cycles in A) through the bead-packed
microchannel. Both fluorescence intensity on the beads and in solution were measured
using fluorescence microscopy and ImageJ software (NIH, USA) by measuring the grey
scale intensity in both regions (16-bit images). The beads provide an increase of ~100fold in fluorescence signal intensity. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation of 4
independent PCR amplification and bead-capture experiments. The inset plot shows the
correlation between cycle threshold values of the tested viral loads and fluorescence
intensity measured on the beads. C- Microscopy images of the beads with increasing copy
numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (initial copy numbers before PCR).

Figure S2. Schematics of the bead capture selectivity in the presence of positive or
negative samples amplified with LAMP or PCR. In the case of LAMP, the fluorescence
is generated by a dsDNA fluorescent intercalator (e.g. SYBR green I). For PCR, the
fluorescence is generated using a molecular beacon (e.g. FAM-BHQ-1 pair). In the tested
setup, the PCR amplicon has a length of 100 bp and is able to effectively penetrate the
pores of the agarose beads. Green droplets indicate strongly fluorescent solutions, while
white droplets indicate non-fluorescent or weakly fluorescent solutions.
