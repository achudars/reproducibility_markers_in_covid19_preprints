Abstract
As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic passes from an acute to a chronic situation, countries and
territories are grappling with the issue of how to reopen safely. The unique kinetics of
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, with its significant presymptomatic transmission, presents an
unprecedented challenge to our intuitions. In this context, a generalizable quantitative
understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on disease control strategies is vital. We
used a previously published time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (He et al., 2020)
to parameterize an epidemiological model of transmission, which was then used to explore the
effect of various disease control measures. Our analysis suggests that using symptom-based
isolation alone as a control strategy is ineffective in limiting the spread of COVID-19, in contrast
to its effectiveness in other diseases, such as SARS and influenza. Additionally, timeliness of
testing and tracing strategies to reduce time to isolation, along with widespread adoption of
measures to limit transmission are critical for any containment strategy. Our findings suggest
that for symptom-based isolation and testing strategies to be effective, reduced transmission is
required, reinforcing the importance of measures to limit transmission. From a public health
strategy perspective, our findings lend support to the idea that symptomatic isolation should
not form the primary basis for COVID-19 disease control.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and its associated disease COVID-19, represent a historic
threat to human health and well-being. In the absence of effective options for prophylaxis and
treatment for this disease, non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) play a critical role in
controlling its spread.
At present, a number of NPIs for COVID-19 have been used in various territories and
jurisdictions: symptom-based testing, isolation of symptomatic individuals, measures to limit
transmission (such as masks, handwashing and social distancing) and molecular tests for the
pathogen. While the first three measures are relatively easy to implement, they have been
adopted to varying degrees in different settings, based in part on cultural beliefs (Middelburg
and Rosendaal, 2020). On the other hand, molecular tests are less easy to implement at a
population level due to their high cost and limited availability and can in many cases take
several days to return results. At the time of this writing, for example, the average turnaround
time from nasal swab to result for COVID-19 tests in the US was 4.1 days (Baum et al., 2020),
with 21% of tests returned after five days or more of waiting.
COVID-19 is a pleiotropic disease, with a complex and unpredictable presentation
(Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). While there are a number of common symptoms for the
disease, including fever, fatigue, dry cough, anosmia and diarrhea, many patients present with
diverse symptoms including muscle ache, confusion, headache, sore throat, chest pain, nausea
and emesis (Garc√≠a, 2020). In extreme cases, some patients have also presented with blood
clots, strokes, and heart attacks (Klok et al., 2020). In addition, reports of the symptom profile
of COVID-19 have changed over time. Early reports emphasized fever, headache and a cough,
while more recent reports emphasized anosmia and diarrhea as major symptoms. As a practical
matter, this diversity of symptoms can make it challenging for patients experiencing symptoms
of COVID-19 to recognize that they have the disease.
Further complicating disease containment is the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While
the initial site of infection for most patients is in the nasopharynx, in more serious cases the
infection makes its way to the lungs. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are typically limited
to the nasopharynx, with viral loads that are similar to symptomatic infections and decrease
more slowly (Lee et al., 2020). Presymptomatic transmission is another concern. It is now well
established that the peak of infectiousness for COVID-19 occurs about two days before the
appearance of symptoms (He et al., 2020). Data from contact tracing studies and model-based
estimates demonstrate that almost half of all transmission occurs from presymptomatic and
asymptomatic patients (Du et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Kerr et al., 2020; Moghadas et al., 2020;
Wei et al., 2020). Clearly, the stealthy nature of COVID-19 transmission poses a significant
challenge for disease-control interventions.
While a number of studies have looked at intervention strategies in specific scenarios
(Davis et al., 2020; Kerr et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020), there is a need for a quantitative
investigation that can be applied broadly to questions of disease control strategy. To better
understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on COVID-19 disease control, we used a
time-dependent model of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This model was based on infector-infectee
pairs that were fitted to a curve to infer the relative infectiousness as a function of time from
symptom onset (He et al., 2020). We employed the time-variant kinetics of infectivity in a

standard susceptible-exposed-infected recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model with two
compartments for the infected population (isolated and un-isolated) and examined the impact
of various disease control strategies in the light of the kinetics of infectiousness. The timevariant kinetics of infectivity of the 1918 flu and SARS and the resulting impact on disease
control are compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 to provide historical context. We hope that these
findings shed light on the utility and limitations of various practical real-world strategies for
COVID-19 disease control.

Methods
SEIR model of SARS-CoV-2 with time-dependent infectiousness:
We developed a dynamic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed the effect
of isolating symptomatic individuals on disease transmission under different scenarios. The
dynamic, deterministic, compartmental model was based on a SEIR structure, with additional
stratification of individuals by whether they were symptomatic (or asymptomatic) and
separately whether they were and effectively isolated (Fig. 1A and parameters and references
in Table 1). Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected through a dynamic process
occurring at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals and the infectious time
course (Fig. 1A). Susceptible individuals (S) become exposed (E) at a rate proportional to the
force of infection, Œª(t), which is the sum of the number of individuals in each infection stage
multiplied by the infectiousness of that stage, given by Œ≤(œÑ) (Fig. 1B). This is the convolution of
the number of individuals in each infectious stage and the infectiousness distribution.

The basic reproductive number, R0, is the area under the curve of the weighted infectiousness
distribution.

The infectiousness time course is set as a gamma distribution with parameters derived from (He
et al., 2020), scaled by R0. R0 represents the average number of infections that an infected
individual passes on to others at the initial time point, in the absence of any interventions in a
susceptible population. R0 was varied throughout this study to simulate changes in the
transmission rate of the disease, which depend on NPIs such as hand-washing, mask wearing,
and social distancing. The baseline R0 for SARS-CoV-2 is conservatively estimated at 2.5 (CDC,
2020a).
Susceptible individuals become exposed (E) but are not infectious for an average of 3
days(Lauer et al., 2020). A proportion of the infected individuals (I) develop symptoms after an
average of 2.3 days of being infectious (He et al., 2020). Upon developing symptoms, individuals
seek testing and isolation (Isr) at a specific time in their infection stage. We assume that each
individual infection is removed at the same time in their infection stage; time to isolation was
varied in simulations to evaluate different isolation scenarios. We assume that all infected
individuals enter the recovered/removed compartment (R) after 14 days from being infected,

Table 1. Model Parameters
SEIR models of SARS and 1918 influenza with time-dependent infectiousness:
We extended the analysis to include analogous SEIR models of both the SARS outbreak in 2003
(Peiris et al., 2003) and the 1918 influenza outbreak (Vynnycky, Trindall and Mangtani, 2007;
Andreasen, Viboud and Simonsen, 2008). Infectiousness distribution for both SARS (Peiris et al.,
2003) and flu (Cori et al., 2012; Ip et al., 2017) were estimated as follows. SARS individuals are
not infectious until symptom onset and infectiousness peaks 10 days after symptom onset. We
assumed few cases of SARS were subclinical (5% to be conservative). For the 1918 flu,
infectiousness begins an average of 1.6 days before symptom onset and peaks 1 day after
symptom onset (Ip et al., 2017; He et al., 2020). Because we are modeling the 1918 flu, we
assumed that no individuals were initially immune, just as none are assumed immune for SARSCoV-2 or SARS, despite some potential role of cross immunity from other flus or coronaviruses.
Using estimates from more recent flu seasons that 24% of flu cases are pauci-symptomatic or
asymptomatic (Ip et al., 2017), we assumed that it was only possible to isolate up to 76% of flu
cases using symptom-based isolation alone. The remaining epidemiological parameters and
their references are listed in Table 1.
Using the epidemic model, we simulated outbreaks of each disease. We assumed that no
infectious individuals enter into the system. The simulations predict the number of individuals
in each compartment over time, the new infections per day, the total percent of the population
expected to be infected, and the effective reproductive number.
Estimation of effective reproductive number (Reff) for each isolation strategy:
The value of Reff was numerically estimated by running a single generation simulation in which 1
infected individual was placed at the first stage of infection in a population of N-1 susceptible

individuals. The total number of secondary infections, as the single infection passes through the
stages of infection, was recorded and used to directly estimate Reff.
Evaluation of real-world limitations on disease control:
To evaluate the effect of imperfect symptomatic isolation, we independently varied both the
time to isolate after symptom onset and the percent of infections that are symptomatic and
eventually isolate. To assess the impact of delayed isolation, we increased the time to isolate
individuals incrementally, holding the percent symptomatic and eventually removed constant
at the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù level (80% for SARS-CoV-2), and recorded the percent not infected, the daily
new infections, and the effective reproductive number. To assess the impact of a lower percent
of infections being symptomatic and eventually removed, we decreased the percent removed
incrementally, holding the time to remove individuals constant at the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù level (2.3 days
after symptom onset for SARS-CoV-2), and recorded the same outputs as mentioned above. To
compare directly the effect of perfect, realistic, and no isolation strategy, we simulated a
perfect isolation strategy as 80% symptomatic and removed after 2.3 days of infection
(immediately after symptom onset), a realistic isolation strategy as 60% symptomatic (CDC,
2020a) and removed after 4.3 days of infection (2 days after symptom onset, (CDC, 2020a)), and
no isolation strategy as 0% removed. We recorded the outputs of percent not infected, daily
new infections, and the effective reproductive number for each scenario, for SARS-CoV-2, SARS,
and 1918 influenza.
Identify regions of parameter space that enable outbreak control
To identify regions of parameter space that enable outbreak control, we varied simultaneously
the percent of the population eventually removed and the time to remove infectious
individuals, and we recorded the total percent infected and the effective reproductive number.
For this analysis, the time to remove infectious individuals was anytime during the infection,
which for SARS-CoV-2 and flu, this could be before symptom onset. This was meant to simulate
the theoretical possibility that individuals could be isolated based on molecular testing or
contact-tracing prior to symptom onset. This set of simulations was performed over a range of
transmission rates corresponding to 50%, 75%, 100%, and 150% of the R0 used in the base
simulations, in order to simulate the effect of transmission reduction measures such as mask
wearing and social distancing, and as well as to simulate high contact scenarios such as a
university. This was performed for SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and 1918 influenza. The analysis of
strategy space as a function of transmission reduction and time to isolation uses a realistic
assumption of the percent of cases that were symptomatic (60% (Kerr et al., 2020)).
Critical basic reproductive number to control outbreak
To determine the baseline transmission rate needed to keep the outbreak under a critical
threshold using symptomatic isolation alone as a mitigation strategy, we varied the basic
reproductive number, R0, and recorded the expected total percent infected and effective
reproductive number for no isolation (Œ± = 0), realistic symptomatic isolation (ùùâisolate = 4.3 days, 2
days after symptom onset, Œ± = 60%, and perfect symptomatic isolation(ùùâisolate = 2.3 days,
immediately upon symptom onset, Œ± = 80%). We repeated this analysis assuming that testing
strategies enable isolation of infectious individuals at 1.5, 1, and 0 days before symptom onset.

The threshold for total percent infected was defined somewhat arbitrarily at twenty percent,
based on the estimated proportion of New York City that was infected in March-April 2020
(Stadlbauer et al., 2020). The critical threshold for the effective reproductive number was
chosen as one, as this would mean that effectively the outbreak would be contained, mitigating
significant future spread.

Results
Evaluating the effectiveness of symptomatic isolation as a containment strategy
Our analysis reveals that perfect symptomatic isolation compared to no isolation measures
reduces the expected total percent infected from 89% to 50% (Fig 1 C-F), indicating that perfect
symptomatic isolation can have a significant impact on control of SARS-CoV-2. Because
symptom onset can be slow and variable (Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), the effect of a
delay in symptomatic isolation was evaluated, revealing that even a one-day delay in isolation
leads to a significant increase in the total percent of the population infected (Fig. 2 A-C).
Additionally, the estimated percent of asymptomatic individuals varies, from 20-40% for the
general population and even higher for younger populations. When the percent of the
infections removed is lowered, the outbreak worsens (Fig. 2 D-F). We compared the ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù
symptomatic isolation strategy to the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù and ‚Äúno isolation‚Äú strategy and we see that the
realistic strategy is much less effective at reducing the total of the population infected, the peak
daily rate of new infections, and the effective reproductive number (Fig. 2 G-I). The realistic
strategy appears to follow a similar trajectory of transmission to no isolation at all, indicating
that slight relaxations from perfect symptomatic isolation render the strategy much less
effective at mitigating spread of disease.

Exploring the effectiveness of timeliness of isolation, degree of adoption, and rate of disease
transmission on outbreak control
Varying the time to isolation and the degree of adoption of isolation, the regions of parameter
space that enable a reasonable control of an outbreak (Reff<1, white line) do not fall within the
region of symptomatic isolation alone strategy (green box, Fig. 3C&G) for the R0 of SARS-CoV-2
(conservatively estimated as 2.5). As the transmission rate (R0) increases, this becomes even
more improbable, with a high percent of the infections needing to be isolated more than a full
day before symptom onset for outbreak control (Fig. 3 D&H). However, as the R0 decreases,
symptomatic isolation alone as a strategy becomes more feasible, with a 50% reduction in
transmission resulting in a significant portion of reasonable strategy space enabling an Reff less
than 1 (Fig. 3A&E). The initial number of infections does not affect the expected total percent
infected as a function of parameter space (Fig. S1), with a lower percent initially infected
corresponding to a longer time-to-peak new infections (Fig. S2). Without lowering the
transmission rate, SARS-CoV-2 is impossible to contain via symptomatic isolation. However,
depending on the efficacy of the isolation strategy, small changes in transmission can have a
significant effect on the total percent of the population infected.

the outbreak can be controlled. The analysis reveals that for a COVID R0 of 2.5 (100% transmission), symptomatic
isolation is not effective at bringing the Reff below 1, but at reduced transmission levels the strategy can be
effective.

For a given isolation strategy (perfect, realistic, and no isolation), our analysis reveals the effect
of reducing transmission (R0) on the total percent infected (Fig. 4). We define a threshold of
20% total infected to show an example of the critical R0 needed for each strategy. Our analysis
reveals that if no isolation is expected to occur, the transmission needs to be reduced by
greater than 50% (R0 = 1.2), if a realistic symptomatic isolation strategy is in place, transmission
needs to be reduced by 40% transmission (R0 = 1.5), and if perfect symptomatic isolation is in
place, transmission needs to be reduced by 12% (R0 = 2.2). The non-linearity of the relationship
between total infections and transmission indicates that, for a specific strategy, small
reductions in transmission can have a significant effect on reducing the number of infections.
None of the symptomatic isolation strategies are effective at reducing total infections to below
20% of the population with the baseline transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 4: Critical R0 for symptomatic isolation of SARS-CoV-2. Total percent infected during the epidemic as a
function of the baseline transmission (R0) under perfect, realistic, and no symptomatic isolation strategies. For all
symptomatic isolation strategies, the R0 must be reduced from its estimated baseline of 2.5 in order to mitigate
the total percent infected from crossing above 20%.

Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to SARS and the 1918 influenza, both were more easily contained via
symptomatic isolation
SARS symptoms develop before infectiousness begins, and peak 10 days after symptom onset
(Fig S3A), and few asymptomatic cases were reported (Ip et al., 2017). The regions of parameter
space for effective symptomatic isolation for SARS are therefore much larger, and infections
can be easily contained even with significant relaxations from perfect symptomatic isolation
and increased transmission (Fig. 5, Fig. S3B-E, Fig. S4).

controlled. The analysis reveals that for SARS, symptomatic isolation was effective at bringing the Reff below 1, even
for higher than normal transmission levels.

The 1918 influenza, in contrast, is similar to SARS-CoV-2. Based on data collected from recent
flu strains, infectiousness begins 1.6 days before symptom onset, but peaks 1 day after
symptom onset (Peiris et al., 2003) (Fig. S5A) and up to 24% of cases may be asymptomatic or
paucisymptomatic (Ip et al., 2017). While these numbers come from recent flu strains, we
expect them to be relatively consistent across flu strains. Our analysis reveals that at the
baseline R0 of the 1918 flu, symptomatic isolation as a control strategy is possible, but only if it
is perfect (Fig. 5G, Fig. S5, Fig S6), as is shown in Figure 5G where the green line represents
symptomatic isolation strategy and the white line defines part of the boundary between Reff <1
and Reff>1. Containment via symptomatic isolation becomes easier if the transmission is
reduced by 75% (Fig. 6A, B, E, F), and impossible if the transmission is increased (Fig. 6 D, H).

symptomatic isolation is just barely able to bring the Reff below 1.

Rapid testing and transmission reduction measures are needed to bring a SARS-CoV-2
outbreak under control

We extended our analysis to allow for isolation prior to symptom onset, theoretically achieved
through rapid and widely available testing. Here we assumed a constant 60% of cases were
isolated through any means. If testing strategies can reduce the average time to isolation, then
smaller reductions in transmission are required for outbreak containment below the 20%
threshold. Transmission must be reduced by 28% (R0 = 1.8) for isolation immediately at
symptom onset and 8% (R0 = 2.3) for isolation 1 day before symptom onset (Fig. 7) to bring the
outbreak below a 20% total infection rate. Isolation 1.5 days prior to symptom onset represents
the only scenario where the outbreak can be controlled without reduction in transmission
(assuming a COVID R0 = 2.5). None of the symptomatic isolation strategies are effective at
reducing total infections to below 20% of the population with the baseline transmission of
SARS-CoV-2(Fig. 3), but increasing the speed at which infected individuals are isolated can lead
to containment under certain transmission reduction scenarios (Fig. 7)

Figure 7: Critical R0 for pre-symptomatic isolation of SARS-CoV-2. Total percent infected during the epidemic as a
function of the baseline transmission (R0) under testing strategies that enable isolation on average 1.5 days before
symptom onset, 1 day before symptom onset, and immediately upon symptom onset. For 1 day before symptom
onset and immediately upon symptom onset, the R0 must be reduced by other means. If the average time of
isolation is 1.5 days or more before the onset of symptoms, the R0 can remain at or above the COVID R0 of 2.5 to
prevent more than 20 % of the population from becoming infected.

Simulating increased testing capacity/contact tracing to reduce time to isolation and increased
mask use/social distancing, we find that both measures contribute to reducing Reff below 1 (Fig.
8a). We assume that increased capacity, efficiency of testing, and contact tracing would allow
access to the region below 0 on the y-axis (Fig. 8a test tube graphic), corresponding to isolation
of individuals prior to symptom onset, when they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt know they had been
infected. If transmission is not reduced (i.e.% transmission = 100), then Reff can only be brought

below 1 if isolation occurs prior to symptom onset (Fig. 8b, Fig 8a). The rate of increase in Reff is
very steep for the region between 2 days before and 2 days after symptom onset, indicating the
potential gain of rapid testing and isolation. Increased mask use and social distancing measures
such as avoiding crowded indoor spaces to reduce transmission (Fig. 8 mask graphic) also have
a significant effect on bringing the Reff under control. If isolation occurs immediately upon
symptom onset, Reff can be reduced below 1 if transmission is reduced by 60% (Fig. 8c, Fig. 8a
red dot). This analysis reveals that measures to reduce transmission via social distancing,
shutdowns, and mask-wearing can reduce Reff below 1, but to resume normal activities in the
absence of significant population immunity, mass rapid testing to shift time to isolation on
average to be below time of symptom onset will be needed to enable epidemic control of SARSCoV-2. Symptom-based testing and isolation alone will inevitably lead to epidemic spread in the
absence of significant measures of transmission reduction.

Discussion
In the early stages of a pandemic, effective control relies on the simultaneous application of
multiple NPIs. Mathematical modeling of the 1918 influenza outbreak has shown that early
application of multiple simultaneous measures, primarily measures to limit transmission, was
associated with a substantial reduction of peak death rates (Hatchett, Mecher and Lipsitch,
2007).
For COVID-19, NPIs can be divided into three kinds of measures: testing, symptomatic
isolation and approaches to limit transmission. While it is unlikely that any one measure will be
implemented in isolation, resource limitations can sometimes lead organizations and territories
to rely more heavily on one measure than others. Therefore, it is important to understand the
impact of individual NPI measures separately, in order to tease out the contribution that each
measure makes to COVID-19 disease control. In this work, we have used a model-based
approach to identify generalizable principles for COVID-19 public health strategy.

Testing for symptoms and isolating individuals is an intuitive and easily implemented
strategy for public health authorities during an outbreak or epidemic. The concept of
quarantine is an ancient one, with an etymology rooted in the Black Death and references
dating back to the Bible (Leviticus 13:4). In recent times, SARS in particular was very effectively
controlled through public health interventions. Our work suggests that this may have happened
in some measure through symptomatic isolation, although studies have raised questions about
the cost-benefit of temperature screening in that context (Chng et al., 2004; St John et al.,
2005; Mouchtouri et al., 2019).
For the current pandemic, many territories and organizations have made symptomatic
testing and isolation an integral part of their strategy for disease control. For example, Walt
Disney World in Florida uses temperature checks on all guests and employees and uses a cutoff
of two consecutive temperature readings of 100.4 F to send employees home (Alicia, 2020).
Similar strategies are being adopted in other resource-constrained settings, such as public
schools, where temperature checks are being adopted as the primary means of controlling the
spread of COVID-19. Symptomatic isolation is cheap to implement and has the appeal of
transferring the burden of responsibility to individuals, which is particularly important in lowresource situations.
Despite the historic appeal and the ease of implementation, our work shows that
symptomatic isolation measures cannot be used as the sole basis for COVID-19 disease control.
In fact, symptomatic isolation is only useful to the extent that it is followed up with contact
tracing, or other measures that can reduce the time to isolation to at or before the emergence
of symptoms. These findings are consistent with other studies on this subject. Model-based
analyses show that symptomatic screening for COVID-19 at airports would be expected to miss
around 46% of infectious travelers (Quilty et al., 2020). News reports from the US from late
February indicated that no cases of SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by temperature screening at
airports (Cohen and Bonifield, 2020), despite airport screening having been in place (CDC,
2020b) for over a month at that time. During the same timeframe, retrospective reports have
demonstrated that community spread was already under way within the country (Jorden et al.,
2020).
While others have commented on the ineffectiveness of symptomatic testing as ‚Äúpublic
health theater‚Äù (Stanley, 2020), our work suggests that symptomatic isolation is nonetheless
valuable as part of a larger strategy, as it will have the effect of limiting spread. In this context,
it is important for authorities to err on the side of caution when it comes to interpreting COVID19 symptoms, and to have generous sick leave policies that enable isolation for those who are
infected.
In more general terms, the effectiveness of any testing-and-isolation strategy (whether
based on symptoms or molecular markers) is strongly dependent on the speed of
implementation of isolation measures (Fig. 8b). Our work suggests that testing-based strategies
are particularly useful in the first few days after infection. However, delays of more than a few
days degrade the value of test results in a nonlinear fashion, such that at day 4 after symptom
emergence there is little to no benefit of test results for the infected patient. In countries
where testing is being limited to symptomatic patients, and where there are delays in testing
(such as the United States), this limits the benefit of the testing for isolation and contacttracing. In some jurisdictions, the responsibility of isolation and contact tracing has been shifted

on to individuals, making timeliness and compliance an open question (Minnesota Department
of Health, 2020).
Our work underscores the importance of measures to limit transmission. These are
particularly relevant in the context of reopening strategies- reopening in the presence of high
levels of community transmission places a very high burden on testing-and-isolation strategies.
On the other hand, reductions in transmission substantially reduce the burden on testing-andisolation, making it easier to obtain benefit from this measure. Because measures to reduce
transmission (such as mask usage) can also be quite cheap and easily implemented, it is
imperative to emphasize their importance in public health messaging around COVID-19 disease
control. Interestingly, our work shows that the benefit of measures to limit transmission scale
linearly with their effectiveness, suggesting that any effort that public health authorities put in
to limiting transmission is likely to be rewarded.
We note that there is a point in this figurative ‚Äúparameter space‚Äù that is actually quite
practically achievable for public health authorities. Using a test-and-isolate strategy, if the
average time of tests returned is around day 0 of symptom onset, and the baseline R0 has been
reduced to about 60%, the effective rate of spread (Reff) is then at or below 1. So, in practical
terms, if public health authorities for a given region can bring the rate of community spread
down somewhat (corresponding to an R0 of about 1.5 for realistic symptomatic isolation, Fig. 4,
Fig. 8), surveillance testing strategies with reasonable turnaround times (1-2 days) can be
expected to be sufficient to control transmission. This is a feasible strategy for high-resource
settings, and it is worth noting that a number of organizations appear to be trying to employ
this strategy, as of this writing (Harvard University, 2020; Ward-Henninger and Maloney, 2020).
Viewed in the context of the evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen,
pandemics are in some sense a measure of our society‚Äôs technological evolution. The bubonic
plague was hard or impossible to control before the germ theory of disease, cholera was
difficult to control before the development of epidemiology as a science, and influenza was
difficult to control before refinements in NPIs and the development of vaccines. In our recent
history, we have had examples of outbreaks such as SARS that were adequately controlled by
measures and technologies readily available to us.
COVID-19 represents a challenge of a different scale. Viewed in this context, it is easy to
understand why this disease in particular has had the ability to grow to a pandemic level. It
challenges our intuitions (around the effectiveness of symptomatic isolation, for example), it
strains our operational capabilities (in particular with the turnaround time for testing), and it
tests our resolve (around the commitment to measures to limit transmission).
Our work shows the importance of a multipronged approach in bringing to heel this
particular disease with its unique transmission kinetics, and points to the importance of rapid
testing/tracing-based isolation and broader reductions in community transmission.
