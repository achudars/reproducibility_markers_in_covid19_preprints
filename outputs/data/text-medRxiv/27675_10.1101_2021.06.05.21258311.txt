Abstract
Individuals with lymphoid malignancies have an increased mortality risk from COVID-19.
Paradoxically, this population is least likely to be protected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as a result of
disease- or treatment-related immunosuppression. Current data on vaccine responses in persons with
lymphoid malignancies is limited.

PROSECO is a UK multi-centre prospective observational study evaluating COVID-19 vaccine
immune responses in individuals with lymphoma. This early interim analysis details the antibody
responses to first- and second- SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)
and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca), in 129 participants. Responses are compared to those obtained in
healthy volunteers.

The key findings of this interim analysis are first, 61% of participants who are vaccinated during or
within 6 months of receiving systemic anti-lymphoma treatment, do not have detectable antibodies
despite two doses of vaccine. Second, individuals with curable disease such has Hodgkin (6/6) and
aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (13/16) develop robust antibody levels to either first or
second doses, when vaccinated > 6 months after treatment completion. Third, participants incurable,
indolent lymphomas have reduced antibody levels to first and second vaccine doses, irrespective of
treatment history. Finally, whilst there was no difference in antibody responses between BNT162b2
and ChAdOx1 in lymphoma participants, BNT162b2 induces 11-fold higher antibody responses than
ChAdOx1 after the second dose in healthy donors.

These findings serve to reassure the community that individuals with treated Hodgkin and aggressive
B-NHL can develop antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Simultaneously it also highlights
the critical need to identify an alternative strategy against COVID-19 for those undergoing systemic
anti-lymphoma treatment, and for individuals with indolent lymphomas.

Antibody Responses after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Lymphoma

Individuals with lymphoid malignancies risk developing severe COVID-19 and are less likely to
develop protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination because of disease- or treatmentrelated immunosuppression. Current data on vaccine responses in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
show antibody responses in 52-75% of individuals after the second dose.1,2 Vaccine responses after
two doses in persons with other lymphoid malignancies remain undefined.

In this study (NCT04858568) we report antibody levels prior to vaccination, two weeks post-first
dose and/or two-four weeks post-second dose in 129 participants with lymphoma.(table S1)
Participants received either ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines, tentwelve weeks apart.3,4 IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen were measured using an
electrochemiluminescent assay (MesoScale Discovery®)5 and responses reported in Binding
Antibody Units/ml (BAU/ml), calibrated against the WHO COVID-19 International Reference
Serum. Antibody titres were compared to those in healthy volunteers.

Antibody titres were significantly reduced in participants "on treatment" (ongoing treatment or
completed ≤ six months before vaccination) compared to "no treatment" (treatment-naive or
completed therapy > six months before first vaccination).(figures 1A, S1) Post-second dose geomean
titres (GMT) for both vaccines were 2·5 BAU/ml (95% CI 1·1-5·8) and 141·8 (75·6-266·0) for "on"
vs. "no treatment", respectively. There was no difference in antibody levels between the vaccines
within lymphoma cases despite significant differences in healthy donors (second dose; ChAdOx1 206
(124-344); BNT162b2 2339 (1923-2844), p<0.0001).

Within the "no treatment" group, participants with curable disease (100% (6/6) Hodgkin and 81%
(13/16) aggressive B-NHL) developed robust antibody levels after the first and second doses
(Hodgkin: 652·2 (604·7-703·4); aggressive B-NHL:244·6 (31·12-1923)).(figure 1B) The exceptions

were chimeric antigen receptor T-cell recipients where 3/3 and 1/2 had no detectable antibodies after
the first and second dose, respectively. Reduced antibody levels were observed in indolent B-NHL
(90·2 (40·15-202·4)). This is despite treatment-naivety or completion of treatment > three years
previously. In participants who completed treatment prior to vaccination, those vaccinated ≤ six
months of chemotherapy +/- anti-CD20, or anti-CD20 monotherapy, and ≤ two months of ibrutinib
monotherapy had no detectable antibodies.(figure 1C)

In summary, individuals with curable lymphoma subtypes such as Hodgkin and aggressive B-NHL
can develop robust serological responses as early as six months post-treatment.

In contrast,

individuals vaccinated whilst undergoing systemic anti-lymphoma therapy, and those with indolent
lymphomas may have impaired serological responses and might benefit from further measures to
protect them against COVID-19.

with lymphoma in the "on treatment" group, blue squares represent participants with lymphoma in the
"no treatment" group, and green triangles represent healthy donors. Participants "on treatment" were
receiving systemic anti-lymphoma therapy at the time of administration of the first dose of vaccine, or
completed treatment ≤6 months prior to the first vaccine dose, or commenced anti-systemic antilymphoma therapy <4 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose. Participants with "no treatment"
were treatment-naive or completed treatment >6 months prior to the first vaccine dose. (Median ages
in years for ChAdOx1 (68;68) and BNT162b2 (70;70) in "on treatment" and "no treatment" groups,
respectively; Healthy donors, median ages are 60 (range 23-70) and 43 (21-77) for ChAdOx1 and
BNT162b2, respectively; No correlation was observed between anti-S levels and age for BNT162b2.)
Binding Antibody Units per ml (BAU/ml) is shown. Anti-S IgG levels ≤ 0.55 BAU/ml are below the
lower limit of detection. Geometric mean titres are shown. Significance was determine using twotailed Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01(**), p<0.001(***).
(B) Anti-S IgG levels in participants with lymphoma from the "no treatment" group, after first and
second doses of both vaccines are shown. Red, blue and green circles represent indolent B-NHL,
aggressive B-NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively. Geometric mean titres are shown.
Significance was determine using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p<0.01(**).
(C) Post-second vaccination anti-S IgG levels were compared to the timing of treatment completion.
The X axes represent the number of months systemic anti-lymphoma treatment was completed prior
to administration of the first vaccine dose. Participants who received their first dose of vaccine whilst
on treatment are plotted at '0' on the X axis. The graph on the left shows the number of months
treatment had completed prior to administration of first dose of vaccine for participants with
aggressive B-NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma.

Types of treatment received were combination

chemotherapy +/- anti-CD20, CAR-T cell therapy or donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) post
allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Similarly, the graphs in the middle and right show the number of
months after completion of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy and Bruton Tyrosine Kinase
inhibitor (BTKi, ibrutinib) monotherapy, respectively, in participants with indolent B-NHL.
