Abstract

17

Background

18

The overall risk of reinfection in individuals who have previously had COVID-19 is unknown.

19

To determine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by at least one positive

20

commercial antibody test performed in a laboratory) in healthcare workers confers future

21

immunity to reinfection, we are undertaking a large-scale prospective longitudinal cohort

22

study of healthcare staff across the United Kingdom.

UK

27

At recruitment, participants will have their serum tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and

28

using these results will be initially allocated to either antibody positive or antibody negative

29

cohorts. Participants will undergo antibody and viral RNA testing at 1-4 weekly intervals

30

throughout the study period, and based on these results may move between cohorts. Any

31

results from testing undertaken for other reasons (e.g. symptoms, contact tracing etc.) or

32

prior to study entry will also be included. Individuals will complete enrolment and fortnightly

33

questionnaires on exposures and symptoms. Follow-up will be for at least 12 months from

34

study entry.

35

Outcome: The primary outcome of interest is a reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 during the

36

study period. Secondary outcomes will include incidence and prevalence (both RNA and

37

antibody) of SARS-CoV-2, viral genomics, viral culture, symptom history and

38

antibody/neutralising antibody titres.

39

Conclusion

40

This large study will help us to understand the impact of the presence of antibodies on the

41

risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2; the results will have substantial implications in terms of

42

national and international policy, as well as for risk management of contacts of COVID-19

43

cases.

1. Introduction

51

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus which causes respiratory illness, was first identified in

52

China in December 2019.(1) Following global spread of the virus, the World Health

53

Organization declared a national pandemic in March 2020. Globally nearly 64 million cases

54

have been reported to the World Health Organization by 4 December 2020, with 1,488,120

55

deaths attributed to COVID-19 (2), and both the virus and the measures put in place to

56

reduce spread have led to significant economic and societal impacts. Whether individuals

57

can be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial question both for contact management of

58

individuals exposed to the virus, but also from the perspective of the implications for the

59

effectiveness of any vaccine produced.

60

The risk of reinfection for individuals who have previously had COVID-19 is unknown. There

61

have been a number of case reports which have identified individuals who have been

62

reinfected with a new and genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 genome from their original

63

infection.(3-8) One recent study of the antibody prevalence from three large cross-sectional

64

surveys in England, measured using a self-administered test, found that over a three month

65

period population prevalence dropped from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1) to 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), suggesting

66

waning antibodies in the population.(9) Several longitudinal studies have looked at titres over

67

time, with one UK based study showing waning of neutralising antibodies over 3 months but

68

with large differences between individuals (those with more severe disease had higher

69

antibody titres at their peak)(10), while another study in Iceland demonstrated maintenance

70

of IgG titres over 4 months.(11) However the implications of these findings are unclear. We

71

know that other human coronaviruses demonstrate similar patterns of waning titres over

72

time, with individuals able to be reinfected and shed virus.(12)

73

Many hospitals are choosing to screen certain staff groups regularly for SARS-CoV-2 to

74

reduce the risk of transmission to patients and colleagues. Healthcare workers have

75

consistently been found to have higher positive antibody prevalence compared with the

76

general population; published surveys in UK hospital staff have reported prevalences of

77

24.5% in a Birmingham Hospital(13), and 31%(14) and 44%(15) in London. For a study

78

examining the risk of reinfection an ideal population to examine this question is one with a

79

high baseline antibody prevalence, where there is an indication for routine SARS-CoV-2

80

screening, easy access to testing and likely to be higher ongoing exposure to SARS-CoV-2

81

in hospitals.

82

The SIREN (Sarscov2 Immunity & REinfection EvaluatioN) study aims to answer the key

83

question of whether prior SARS-CoV-2 infection confers future immunity to SARS-CoV-2

84

reinfection. The study design will also enable important secondary outcomes to be

85

examined, including antibody titre change over time, incidence of new infections, clinical and

86

demographic factors correlating with antibody presence, phylogenetic relatedness of

87

healthcare worker infections and ability to culture viable virus from those who are reinfected.

2. Methods
2.1.

Study design

91

This is a prospective longitudinal cohort study which will enrol up to 100,000 individuals and

92

follow them up for 12 months with regular data collection. Individuals will be enrolled

93

between June 2020 and March 2021.

94

2.2.

Study objectives

95

The overall aim of this study is to determine if prior SARS -CoV-2 infection in health care

96

workers confers future immunity to reinfection.

97
98

Primary Objective: To determine whether the presence of antibody to SARS-CoV-2 (anti-

99

SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a reduction in the subsequent risk of reinfection over short

100

term periods (reviewed monthly) and the next year.

101

Secondary Objectives:

102

1. To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff working in healthcare

103

organisations by region, using baseline serological testing at study entry and

104

symptom history from January 1st 2020 to date of study entry

105

2. To estimate the subsequent incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-

106

CoV-2 infection and determine how this varies over time, using regular PCR testing

107

(combined with any intercurrent symptomatic testing)

108

3. To estimate cumulative incidence of new infections in staff working in healthcare

109

organisations stratified by age, sex, staff group, ethnicity and co-morbidities

110

4. To measure the ability to culture viable virus from cases of reinfection diagnosed by

111

PCR and whether those who are persistently positive on PCR are continuing to shed

112

viable virus

126

Population

127

The eligible population are staff members of healthcare organisations. Staff are recruited

128

from healthcare organisations participating as SIREN sites, and all NHS Trusts/Health

129

Boards (organisations that manage hospitals) in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern

130

Ireland have been invited to join. At a later stage, recruitment may be extended to staff from

131

other healthcare organisations such as primary care organisations and the independent

132

sector.

is willing to remain engaged with follow-up for 12-months. Temporary short-term staff

137

members are not eligible.

138

Recruitment and consent

139

Sites are responsible for recruiting eligible participants, according to their own processes.

140

Sites are recommended to circulate all staff communications inviting volunteers and to

141

monitor the demographics of their cohort as they recruit, aiming to represent their staff

142

population. There are no requirements for quotas or structured sampling.

143

Interested and eligible potential participants are provided with a unique study number and

144

passcode by their site research team and directed to enrol in the study by completing the

145

online consent form and enrolment questionnaire. On completion of the online consent form

146

and enrolment questionnaire, participants join the SIREN cohort. Site research teams are

147

automatically informed of participant enrolment in real-time, and can then contact

148

participants to arrange testing.

149
150

2.4.

Data collection

151

At enrolment

152

At enrolment participants complete an online questionnaire and submit serum and a nose

153

swab (or nose and throat swab) for SARS-CoV-2 antibody and nucleic acid amplification

154

(NAAT) testing. Participants will have up to 10mls of blood taken by venepuncture at

155

enrolment and follow-up. The questionnaire collects information on participant

156

demographics, work environment, symptom and testing history, participation in clinical trials

157

and known COVID exposures since 1 January 2020.

All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

158

At follow-up

159

Participants undergo regular repeat NAAT and antibody testing throughout the study period,

160

initially at fortnightly intervals, although frequency may be revised (weekly to monthly)

161

subject to local/national epidemiology and feedback. Participants are sent a link to an online

162

follow-up questionnaire on a fortnightly basis, with a reminder message sent after 2 days if

163

the follow-up questionnaire is not completed. These questionnaires capture information on

164

symptoms, exposures and subsequent enrolment in vaccine or prophylaxis trials.

165

Testing at SIREN site laboratories and data sources

166

For all participants NAAT (typically PCR) and antibody testing is undertaken locally at the

167

laboratory used by their healthcare organisation. The healthcare organisation is responsible

168

for issuing results to the participants as per local procedures. Testing platforms, including

169

choice of antibody assay, is determined locally.

170

All laboratories for SIREN participating sites submit their antibody and antigen testing data

171

into Public Health England’s (PHE) Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS).

172

Testing data from sites on SIREN participants is obtained by the PHE SIREN team through

173

deterministic linkage, based on the NHS number (or equivalent unique identifier for Devolved

174

Administrations) and additional patient identifiers provided by participants in the enrolment

175

questionnaire. Linkage to site testing data for participants in Devolved Administrations is

176

organised with the support of their respective public health agencies. At enrolment,

177

participants consent for the SIREN team to link all their historic and future SARS -CoV-2

178

testing data, including tests undertaken prior to enrolment, and tests taken outside SIREN,

179

such as tests taken due to symptoms or exposures.

2.5.

181

Serology

182

For all participants, at enrolment an aliquot of 2ml serum will be shipped to and stored in the

183

PHE biobank. At follow-up, serum samples for participants who have ever been antibody

184

positive or antigen positive or have enrolled in a vaccine trial will be sent to and stored at the

185

PHE biobank.

186

At enrolment, all participants will have their serum re-tested by PHE for antibodies to SARS-

187

CoV-2, including the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N)

188

protein assays(16) and additional in-house assays to examine for neutralising antibody.

189

Individuals will be classified as seropositive or seronegative based on PHE antibody testing

190

for N and S.

191

In addition to the cohort serological characterisation at enrolment described above,

192

seropositive participants in whom reinfection is identified, plus a cohort of matched non-

193

infected seropositive controls, will have their sera further characterised using additional

194

assays and for the presence of neutralising antibody, to provide hypothesis generating data

195

on mechanisms of protective immunity.

196

Genomic analysis

197

All positive samples from participants will be sequenced as part of the routine sequencing of

198

NHS residual samples in COG-UK Consortium laboratories. For participants who have more

199

than one positive PCR test, genomes will be compared where possible to provide evidence

200

to support reinfection or persistent infection. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS -CoV-2 from

201

staff in healthcare organisations, using the study samples and the wider collection of

202

genomes available through the COG-UK Consortium, will also be undertaken as an

203

exploratory analysis into the diversity and spread of SARS -CoV-2 in healthcare workers.

204

Viral Culture

205

Participants with possible reinfection or persistent infection will be identified and viral culture

206

requested. This may be on residual sample from the swab already taken, but in certain

207

circumstances (e.g. viral culture not possible on the residual sample) we may request

208

another swab is taken and sample sent for culture.

209

T-cell assays and other studies

210

Participants who are persistently NAAT positive, have potentially been reinfected, or have

211

discordant serology may be contacted by the SIREN Study Team to link into optional

212

regional sub-studies e.g. assessing T cell assays and antibody dynamics.

213
214

2.6.

Sample size and power

215

A simulation approach using a mixed effects Poisson regression model has been used to

216

estimate the power to detect relative differences between the study cohorts. Our key

217

assumptions include that 25% of our cohort will be seropositive at enrolment (based on 20%

218

of staff who were asymptomatic and tested positive in one London hospital between 23

219

March and 2 May 2020(14)), and a total attrition of 35%, (unaffected by serostatus and

220

occurring at a constant rate). The proportion of seropositive recruits at each site has been

221

obtained from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0.25 and standard deviation of 0.05 to

222

reflect expected inter-site variation.

223

Power was estimated as the proportion of simulations for which the Wald statistic p value for

224

the estimated incidence rate ratio in the seropositive compared to seronegative cohorts was

225

less than 0.05. Our simulations found that there is statistical power of 80% or greater to

226

detect a relative decrease of 30% or greater in cumulative incidence, provided the

227

cumulative incidence in the seronegative group is in excess of 5%; even taking the

228

cumulative incidence to as low as 2% in the seronegative group there is still sufficient power

229

of in excess 80% for relative decrease of 80% or greater.

230

It was assumed that on average 250 participants would be recruited from each selected

231

healthcare organisation, with a standard deviation of 50. The cumulative incidence in each

232

site in the seronegative cohort has been simulated using Gaussian distributions with means

233

of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 each with a coefficient of variation of 0.2. This range represents that

234

which is feasible to observe over a 12-month period, given the behavioural and social

235

interventions still being employed during the study to control transmission.

236

A study duration of 52 weeks has been assumed with the inter-test period of 2 weeks.

237

It was assumed that the cumulative incidence in the seronegative cohort was 30% with a

238

between trust coefficient of variation of 0.1, reflecting levels of seropositivity in HCWs at the

239

time. Relative reductions in cumulative incidence in the seropositive cohort was varied

240

between 1 (no protection from infection) to 0.1 (antibody effectiveness of 90%). Units in the

241

simulations were allocated to be infected or not, using a draw from a Bernoulli distribution

242

with p equal to the site and cohort specific simulated cumulative infection rate. A simplifying

243

assumption of a constant infection rate over the study period has been used.

244

For each scenario a set of 200 simulations were performed. For each simulation, the total

245

number if infections and person weeks of follow-up was calculated for each cohort in each

246

organisation. This data was analysed using a mixed effects Poisson model, using the natural

247

logarithm of the person weeks as an offset. These are presented in Table 1, indicating that

248

there is sufficient power for all but the smallest immune efficacy of 0.1 i.e. a 10% reduction in

249

incidence in the seropositive cohort. Such a small reduction is indicative of a level of

250

protection unable to provide a means of controlling the pandemic via natural herd immunity.

Statistical Analysis Plan: primary outcome measure

256

All enrolled participants will be included in analyses, which will account for clustering by

257

research site. Analyses will be conducted at regular intervals following sufficient events of

258

interest.

259

Estimates of both cumulative incidence and incidence density in the seropositive and

260

seronegative cohorts will be obtained using mixed effects models assuming counts of PCR

261

positive have a negative binomial distribution, a log link function, and the natural logarithm of

262

the total number of subjects or the total follow-up time use as an offset, respectively.

263

Inclusion of a binary predictor indicating the serostatus of the cohort into this model will

264

provide estimates of the incidence rate ratio. Sites will be incorporated as a random intercept

265

to account for unmeasured, shared, site level factors. To account for a non-constant force of

266

infection, calendar month will be incorporated as an additional random effect. An

267

assessment of the role of factors such as age, gender and ethnicity in immunity will be

268

explored by inclusion of interactions within the model between each and serological status.

269

While the above analytical approaches provide a “classical” person-years approach to

270

prospective cohort analysis and provide familiar measures of association, it may be

271

inadequate to assessment of immunity provided by seroconversion. As it is expected that

272

seropositivity is likely to confer a degree of short to median term protection for a SARS-CoV12

273

2 infection, multi-state and parametric cure rate models incorporating frailty will also be

274

employed. Bayesian approaches to cure rate models with frailty as describe by deSouza(17)

275

will be employed.

276

It is also possible to introduce “misclassification” of state into the multi state model, providing

277

an estimate of sensitivity to account for imperfect serological tests. Approaches like those

278

proposed by Jackson(18) will be employed.

279

Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data

280

Analyses will be restricted to cases with antibody and PCR tests. The PCR test for virus is

281

being used as a diagnostic test and hence has high performance. Sufficient sera will be

282

obtained to re-run the immunological assays in case of initial assay failure. For similar

283

reasons we do not anticipate that spurious data will be obtained.

284

Procedures for Reporting any Deviation(s) from the Original Statistical Plan

285

Deviations from the original statistical plan or the statistical analysis plan will be described

286

and justified in the analysis reports.

287

Data will be analysed using STATA.v15 and R software.

288

289

3. Study oversight

290

Oversight is provided by the Study Management Group, chaired by the Chief Investigator,

291

with representatives from Public Health England, Public Health Scotland, Public Health

292

Wales, Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland), and the COVID-19 Genomics Consortium

293

UK (COG-UK).

294

The study follow-up period will end by default 12 months following the enrolment of the last

295

participant, but by consensus of the Study Management Group and funder may be

296

terminated sooner if findings are sufficient. There are no formal stopping rules for futility,

4. Ethics and Consent

301

The study has received approval from Berkshire Research Ethics Committee and has also

302

received support from NIHR as an urgent public health study, which allows central research

303

network resources to recruit participants. All participants have provided informed consent

304

prior to entry to the study and have the option to withdraw at any time. At withdrawal,

305

participants can choose to have their data or samples retained or destroyed, or partial

306

variations. Protocol deviations and breaches will be recorded by the site research teams and

307

the Sponsor will be informed of any serious breaches within one working day.

5. Discussion
5.1.

Strengths

311

This study is the largest national longitudinal study of this scale examining the question of

312

reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 that the authors are aware of globally. In a system where staff

313

members may be tested in different settings depending on the timing and reasons for testing

314

(community testing hubs, other hospitals, primary care), the automated method of data

315

extraction and access to national testing data means that the study is less likely to miss

316

potential cases. As far as possible the study is designed to run alongside normal laboratory

317

processes; laboratories use the same assays and procedures which are in place for all other

318

testing, reducing additional burden on sites.

319

The study design lends itself to forming sub-cohorts for more detailed investigations. It has

320

active research collaborations with immunology researchers from the UK Research and

5.2.

Weaknesses

326

Cohort retention will be an important consideration for the study team, to avoid losing power

327

to detect the primary outcome and potential introduction of bias if there is differential attrition

328

by cohort. To mitigate this, the study team will actively monitor withdrawals and participant

329

feedback, to implement improvements and will establish direct participant communications

330

(e.g. a newsletter) to promote engagement. Over the study period, it is likely that vaccine

331

trials and usage will increase; adjustments to the study methodology may be required to

332

permit co-enrolment and retain SIREN participants who subsequently receive vaccines, and

333

to incorporate vaccine efficacy into the analyses. Differences in demographics, general

334

health and ongoing risk of exposure between healthcare workers and the general population

335

mean that the results may not be fully generalisable to the UK population.
