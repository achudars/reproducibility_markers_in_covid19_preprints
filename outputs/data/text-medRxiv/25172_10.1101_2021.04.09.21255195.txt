Ovarian follicular function is not altered by SARS-Cov-2 infection or
BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccination.
Abstract:
Importance:

This is the first study to examine the impact of SARS-Cov-2 infection and

COVID-19 vaccination on ovarian function.

Objective

: To characterize anti-COVID-19 antibodies in follicular fluid and compare

ovarian follicle function in women following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19

vaccination, and non-infected, unvaccinated controls.

Design

This is a cohort study conducted between February 1 and March 10, 2021.

Setting:

A single university hospital-based IVF clinic.

Participants:

Consecutive sample of female patients undergoing oocyte retrieval.

Interventions:

Consenting patients were

recruited and assigned to one of three study groups:

recovering from confirmed COVID 19 (n=9); vaccinated (n=9); and uninfected, non-

vaccinated controls (n=14). Serum and follicular fluid samples were taken and analyzed for

anti-COVID IgG as well as estrogen, progesterone and HSPG2 concentration, as well as the

number and maturity of aspirated oocytes and previous estrogen and progesterone

measurements.

Main outcome measures

: Follicular function, including steroidogenesis, follicular

response to the LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarkers.

Results:

Both natural and vaccine elicited anti-COVID IgG antibodies were detected in the

follicular fluid in levels proportional to the IgG serum concentration. No differences were

detected in any of the surrogate ovarian follicle quality reporting parameters.

Conclusions and relevance:

Both SARS-COV-2 infection and vaccination with the

BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine mediate IgG immunity that crosses into the follicular fluid. No

detrimental effect on follicular function was detected.

Introduction:
Since emerging in the last months of 2019, over 127,000,000 individuals have contracted

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the documented death toll from COVID-19 had

reached 2,788,639 individuals globally by the end of March, 2021

1.

Jerusalem, the setting

of the present study, has presented one of the highest incidence rates of COVID-19 in Israel

2.

Nationwide anti-COVID-19 vaccination began in Israel in December 2020, using the Pfizer –

BioNtech vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA). By the end of March 2021, 5,216,801 and 4,700,957

individuals received the first and second doses of the vaccine, representing 56.1% and

50.55% of Israel’s population, respectively. Vaccination for reproductive age individuals

began in January 2021; by the end of March 2021, 72.3% and 61.3% of 20-29 year olds,

77.1% and 67.8% of 30-39 year olds, and 82% and 74.5% of 40-49 year olds had received

the first and second doses of the vaccine, respectively, the highest proportions in the

2

world .

Both the rapidly spreading disease and the vaccination campaign were associated with

3-5. There is still

concerns regarding potential detrimental effects on future fertility

a lack of

real-world data to assist clinicians in counseling their IVF patients regarding the possible

impact of recent recovery from COVID infection or vaccination against it, on the potential

for success of assisted reproductive treatments. While it has been suggested that COVID-19

might impact fertility, no studies, to the best of our knowledge, have proven a direct

gonadal effect of either the disease or the vaccine

4-8.

We aimed to determine the impact of confirmed COVID-19 disease and/or immunization

on human follicular function, by comparing follicular steroidogenesis, response to the

LH/hCG trigger, and oocyte quality biomarker (HSPG2), in the aspirated follicular fluid of

patients undergoing ovum pick-up.

Methods:
The study was approved by the Hadassah Medical Center IRB (Permit 0053-21-HMO). The

study was registered at the clinical trial registry and assigned the registration number

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255195; this version posted April 13, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

NCT04822012 (Protocol # 0053-21-HMO). Consecutive patients undergoing OPU for either

IVF, ICSI, or oocyte cryopreservation were approached to participate in the study on the

day of ovum pickup. Eligibility criteria were age older than 18 years and willingness to

participate and provide informed consent. Patients younger than 18 or older than 44

years, as well as patients with poor ovarian response (less than 3 mature follicles) were

excluded.

After providing informed consent, the patients were questioned about their confirmed past

SARS-Cov-2 infection / vaccination status. For recovering patients, the date of the recovery

(negative nasopharyngeal COVID PCR test) was recorded. Vaccinated patients were asked

about the date of the first and second vaccines. None of the recovering patients were

vaccinated with anti-COVID vaccine. The clinic’s strict policy is to screen all patients using a

nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 a week prior to the procedure, except those patients

who were less than 3 months following recovery from SARS-Cov-2 infection, and those

more than 2 weeks after the second COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, together with the

negative anti-COVID serum antibody test, we could safely presume that all control patients

in this study were indeed COVID-19 negative. During the oocyte retrieval the first follicle/s

were aspirated into an empty tube. If the sample was contaminated with blood another

clean sample was taken, until a total volume of 5 ml of a clean sample was achieved. A 5 ml

blood sample was also taken during the procedure. Following the isolation of the oocyte,

the FF was centrifuged at 1500g and the blood sample at 3000g for 7 minutes. The

supernatant fraction of the follicular fluid and the serum fraction of the blood sample were

each aliquoted and later snap frozen and stored at -80 C° until analysis.

Data including the patient age, IVF indication, antral follicle count (AFC), serum estradiol

and progesterone on the day of ovulation trigger (36 hours before oocyte retrieval), type of

trigger, the number of oocytes, and mature oocytes, were recorded.

Once the target date was reached the samples were thawed and analyzed for the following

assays. The analysis of the blood and FF samples for all outcome parameters was

conducted with blinding of the COVID / Vaccine status of the participant.

Serum and follicular fluid anti-COVID IgG measurement:

The levels of specific anti- SARS–CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG

were assessed in serum and follicular fluid specimens, using the Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG

II Quant assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, USA), according to the manufacturer's

specifications. IgG levels ≥ 50 AU/mL were considered positive.

Assessment of ovarian follicle functions:

Steroidogenesis:

We examined the ability of the Theca- granulosa cells that form the wall

of the follicles to produce steroids, namely estradiol and progesterone, by measuring their

concentration both in the serum and FF.

The measurement was conducted using the Atellica IM Siemens Healthineers system

(Siemens Healthcare GmbH Henkestr. 127 91052 Erlangen Germany). Estradiol

concentration was measured using the Enhanced Estradiol Kit (# 10995561) an ELISA

based on acridinium-labeled sheep monoclonal anti-estradiol antibody with a measuring

range of 43.31-11,010.0 pmol/L). For measuring FF estradiol, the typical concentration of

which exceeds the measuring range of the kit, the sample was diluted using the Atellica IM

eE2 diluent (10995563) according to a protocol described elsewhere

9.

The measurement

of serum and FF progesterone was conducted using the PRGE kit (10995660). The kit is

based on direct chemiluminescent technology using an acridinium-labeled mouse

monoclonal anti-progesterone antibody with a measuring interval of 0.67-190.80 nmol/L.

For FF progesterone measurement, the sample was diluted with the Atellica IM Multi-

diluent (10995645) according to the protocol

9.

To normalize estradiol production, we used the ratio of serum estradiol on the day of the

10

trigger per retrieved oocyte. This ratio was found in a large study

to be an age

independent predictor of IVF treatment outcome. In that study an estradiol/oocyte ratio of

> 1,000 pmol/L/Oocyte was associated with a reduction in pregnancy and clinical

To assess the adequacy of response of the follicle to the LH/hCG trigger we compared the

following parameters:

1.

Oocyte yield: the ratio between the number of retrieved oocytes to the number of

mature follicles measured on the day of the trigger injection. This ratio represents

the ability of the granulosa cells to secrete enzymes that release the cumulus oocyte

complex from the wall of the follicle in response to the LH surge, thereby allowing

its aspiration. An oocyte yield of 45% or less was defined as sub-optimal

2.

11.

Ratio of mature oocytes to total aspirated oocytes, representing another aspect of

the adequacy of response to the LH/hCG trigger – promoting the completion of the

first meiotic division.

3.

Ratio of the number of retrieved oocytes to the number of follicles that began

luteinisation, obtained by dividing the number of retrieved oocytes by the serum

concentration of progesterone on the day of OPU.

Assessment of oocyte quality FF biomarkers:
Concentration of Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycan II in follicular fluid (HSPG2): A proteomic

analysis of over 500 FF proteins identified the concentration of HSPG2 (Pearlecan) in FF as

the strongest biomarker to predict oocyte fertilization and IVF success

12.

We analyzed the concentration of HSPG2 in FF using the Human HSPG2 SimpleStep ELISA

kit (Abcam, Discovery Drive, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0AX, UK).

This ELISA system uses an affinity tag labeled capture antibody and a reporter conjugated

detector antibody read at 450-600nm. The test range of measurement is 47 -7,000 pg/ml.

Dilution of the samples with up to 1:50k was done with a proper diluent. The analysis was

conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed using SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous intervals

and ratios that were not normally distributed were transformed to a logarithmic scale for

normality correction. Normally distributed data were compared across study groups by

univariate ANOVA. Rates and proportions were compared with the Chi-square or Fisher's

considered significant at <0.05.

Results:
Patient characteristics:

Overall, 32 patients consented to participate in the study, of which 9 reported vaccination

(Group 1 – Vaccine); 7 to have recovered from COVID (Group 2 – disease); and 16 denied

both and were allocated to the non-exposed group (Group 3). However, serum analysis for

the presence of anti-COVID-19 IgG identified two of the patients in the control group as

recoverees from a likely asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection and therefore were re -

allocated to Group 2. Mean time periods from vaccine or recovery to recruitment and

sampling were as follows: 93.2 days from recovery to sampling (range 48-169 days); 11.7

days from first vaccine dose to sampling in the 4 patients who were recruited after

completion of a single vaccine dose (range 8-18 days) and 27.6 days from second vaccine

dose to sampling in 5 patients recruited after completing two doses (range 4-46 days).

different groups (44%, 44%, and 28.6% in the vaccinated, COVID, and control groups,

respectively, P value 0.766).

Anti-COVID IgG antibodies:

Table 2 describes the presence of anti-COVID IgG induced by either SARS-COV-2 infection

or secondary to vaccination with the Pfizer – BioNtech vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA). All the

patients who received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine had a high concentration

of COVID IgG in their serum and FF (range 850-19,672 and 463-15,883 in the serum and FF

respectively). IgG concentrations were positively correlated with the time interval from the

date of the vaccine: two of the patients that had only received the first dose, 13 and 18 days

before OPU, were found to harbour anti-COVID IgG in their serum and FF (range 194-228

and 64-198 in the serum and FF respectively), while the two who received the first dose

only 8 days prior to OPU had no measurable anti -COVID IgG either in their serum or FF.

All the patients with positive serum anti-COVID IgG had detectable levels of anti-COVID IgG

in their follicular fluid. Figure one shows a linear association between the serum and FF

2

concentrations of anti-COVID IgG (R

=0.99), suggesting a nonregulated passage of the anti-

COVID IgG across the follicular membrane.

No difference was found between women acquiring anti-COVID antibodies following

exposure or vaccination, in the ratio between FF to serum anti-COVID IgG.

Assessment of ovarian follicle functions:

Table 3 describes treatment and outcome parameters. These parameters provide data on

the steroidogenic function of the follicle (trigger day serum and FF estradiol and

progesterone concentrations) and the magnitude of the ova recruitment, as reflected by the

number of aspirated eggs.

Mean serum estradiol on the day in which the trigger injection was administered (36 hours

prior to OPU) did not differ among the groups (P value 0.351). The normalized ratio of

serum estradiol on trigger day / oocyte was similar and within the optimal range for most

of the patients in all groups. Serum progesterone on the same day was lower in the non-

exposed group (3.29, 3.31 and 1.64 nmol/L in the vaccine, COVID and non-exposed

respectively, P value 0.008) however no difference was measured in serum progesterone

on the day of OPU (22.6, 26.5 and 18.6 nmol/L in the vaccine, COVID and control groups

respectively, P value 0.40).

Although both FF estradiol and progesterone concentrations were hundreds fold higher

compared to serum concentrations on the same day, no difference was found among the

groups (2,160, 2,890 and 2,217 nmol/L for estradiol and 34,569, 32.886 and 32,811

nmol/L for progesterone in the vaccine, COVID and non-exposed groups, respectively, P

values 0.426 and 0.950).

The adequacy of the follicular response to ovulation triggering was assessed by serum and

FF progesterone as well as by the oocyte yield (oocytes retrieved/trigger day mature

follicle count, oocytes retrieved /OPU day serum progesterone, ratio of mature/ total

number of aspirated oocytes).

Oocyte yield was high in all groups (mean 152%, P value 0.772) well above the 45%

threshold defining a sub-optimal response. Similarly, the rate of mature oocytes was

normal (mean 0.72 P Value 0.554). The ratio between the number of aspirated oocytes and

OPU day progesterone was 0.63, 0.45, and 0.61 in the vaccine, COVID, and control groups

respectively, P value 0.372.

Assessment of oocyte quality with follicular fluid HSPG2

None of these follicle quality reporter surrogates suggested any meaningful differences

among the 3 groups. The mean FF HSPG2 for all samples was 6,340 ng/ml (median 3,250,

range 302-43,603). Comparison of HSPG2 between the groups showed similar

pregnancy to the list of high-risk conditions to prioritize vaccination, and ACOG

conceive

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to determine the ovarian

involvement with the COVID immune response, as reflected by the presence of anti-SARS-

COV-2 IgG in recently vaccinated vs. infected and non-vaccinated non-infected IVF patients,

all of whom were PCR negative at the time of OPU.

Our results show that all the patients reported as COVID-19 recoverees had measurable

anti-SARS-COV-2 IgG both in their serum and FF. The presence of anti-COVID IgG following

vaccination was shown as early as 13 days following the first dose, both in the serum and

FF. The concentration of anti-COVID IgG correlated with the time interval from the vaccine.

The anti-COVID IgG in the FF reflects its serum concentration in a linear association, as

previously described for other vertically transmitted viruses

15.

Our assessment of a potential effect of either infection with SARS-COV-2 or vaccination on

ovarian function included several aspects related to the egg-follicle performance.

Assessment of follicular steroidogenesis showed similar and normal rates of estrogen and

progesterone production. The only significant difference we detected was a lower trigger

day serum progesterone in the non-exposed group, a difference that was not shown on the

day of OPU, either in the serum or FF, and therefore is unlikely to represent a real biological

difference. Otherwise, none of the synthetic parameters studied showed any differences

among the 3 groups. Assessment of the response of the follicles to the LH/hCG trigger

showed a normal and similar response in all 3 groups.

Oocyte quality assessment:

We compared the concentration of FF HSPG2, a validated biomarker of oocyte quality. FF

samples showed a high concentration of HSPG2 that was not significantly different

between the groups.

Hence, despite the clear evidence of intimate follicular immune exposure post infection

with SARS-COV-2 or following BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the steroidogenic machinery of

the follicle, controlling the ultimate maturation of the oocyte and its hormonal milieu, did

not show any measurable difference as compared to non-exposed women. This evidence

joins other data on IVF treatment outcomes among recoverees from COVID-19 infection

observed in our center, which showed similar outcomes (data not shown).

Strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to examine the presence of natural or

vaccine-elicited humoral immune response in the ovarian follicle. In addition, we also

investigated the possible association between its presence and several aspects of follicular

function and oocyte yield. We chose not to examine the rate of fertilization and embryo

formation and development, as they involve the male gametes and may introduce

differences unrelated to the study question.

This is however a small study, comprising a mixed fertile and infertile population, and its

conclusions should be supported and validated by larger studies. Due to its timing, our

study was able to assess short term affects of vaccine and disease but cannot rule out later

sequelae.

Conclusions
Exposure to either the SARS-COV-2 virus or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine results in a rapid

formation of anti-COVID IgG that can be detected in the follicular fluid, correlating with

serum concentrations. In our study, neither infection or the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, nor

the immune response to them, resulted in any measurable detrimental effect on the

function of the ovarian follicle.
