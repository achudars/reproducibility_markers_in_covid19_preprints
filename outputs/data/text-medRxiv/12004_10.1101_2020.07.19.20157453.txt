Abstract

19

Background: Previous studies reported recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in individuals

20

who had recovered from COVID-19 infections. However, little is known regarding the

21

systematic review of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity. The current study conducted a

22

systematic review and meta-analysis, aimed to estimate the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2

23

RNA positivity after recovery from COVID-19 and to determine the factors associated with

24

recurrent positivity.

25

Methods:

26

ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry for

27

studies published to June 12, 2020. Studies were reviewed to determine the risk of bias. A

28

random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2.

29

Results: Fourteen studies of 2,568 individuals were included. The incidence of recurrent SARS-

30

CoV-2 positivity was 14.81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.44–18.19%). The pooled

31

estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrence was 35.44 days (95% CI: 32.65–38.24

32

days), and from the last negative to recurrent positive result was 9.76 days (95% CI: 7.31–12.22

33

days). Patients with younger age (mean difference [MD]=-2.27, 95% CI: -2.95 to -1.80) and a

34

longer initial illness (MD=8.24 days; 95% CI: 7.54 – 8.95; I2=98.9%) were more likely to

35

experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity, while patients with diabetes (RR=0.52; 95% CI:

36

0.30-0.90; I2=53%), severe disease (RR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; I2=70%), and a low

37

lymphocyte count (RR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.39 – 0.86; I2=48%) were less likely to experience

38

recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity.

Background

48

Globally, the reported number of confirmed infections and deaths due to the severe acute

49

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic) was 7,410,510 and 418,294,

50

respectively, by June 12 2020.[1] Country governments have implemented public health

51

measures such as lockdowns, physical distancing, use of face masks, and frequent hand-washing;

52

however, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still increasing. The proportion of severe

53

cases and case fatality rates have been reported to be 25.6% and 3.6%, respectively,[2] with

54

individuals with comorbidities being at greater risk of developing severe disease.[2,3]

55

The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided criteria for assessing the recovery

56

of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[4] Recently, there have

57

been several reports of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in individuals who had recovered

58

from COVID-19.[5,6] It was estimated that the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity in

59

individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, ranged from 7.3%[5] to 21.4%.[6] However,

60

to date no systematic reviews have been published to provide a pooled estimate of the incidence

61

of recurrent positivity.. This systematic review aimed to: estimate the incidence of recurrent

62

SARS-CoV-2 positivity and determine the characteristics and risk factors related to the recurrent

63

SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who had recovered from COVID-19.

Data management and study selection

82

Literature search results were organized using Mendeley (Mendeley, Ltd, Elsevier, UK).

83

Article titles and abstracts retrieved from the databases were transferred to Mendeley citation

84

manager after being screened and checked for duplication. All records that did not meet the

85

eligibility criteria were excluded from the review.

86

The eligibility of articles based on their title and abstract was assessed independently by

87

MA and AF. If necessary, the full paper was retrieved to further determine the eligibility status.

88

In cases of disagreement regarding eligibility, consensus was reached by consulting a third

89

reviewer (MR). The eligibility criteria were: (i) the study designs are cross-sectional, case-

90

control or cohort design; (ii) the study reports the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity

91

in individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and its related factors; and (iii) the articles

92

included published or unpublished studies. The published studies may included both peer-

93

reviewed reports and pre-print reports. Studies in languages other than English were excluded if

94

no translated version of the manuscript was available.

95

The full text of the articles that met the eligibility for the review were then assessed. If

96

the data provided in the articles were incomplete, the author was contacted to obtain complete

97

data. Data collection forms were used for specific purposes, including the screening process,

98

determining eligibility, data collection, and incomplete data identification as well as the risk of

99

bias assessment.

100

Data extraction and quality assessment

101

The following data items were extracted: authors, funding, study design, the population

102

of the study, number of episodes of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity per case, and patient

103

characteristics. The patient characteristics considered included age, sex, body mass index,

104

clinical/laboratory manifestations, and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The

105

outcome was recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity in individuals who had recovered from COVID-

106

19, determined as based on positive result of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

107

(RT-PCR)on re-testing, after being followed-up or re-admitted after discharged from hospital.

108

We used the quality assessment tool for cross-sectional and cohort studies published by

109

the National Institutes of Health to assess the methodological quality of included studies.[9] Each

110

item was scored 0 or 1 point based on the criteria. A total of all items ranged from 0 to 14 was

111

used to assess the quality of the article. Based on the overall score, we categorized articles to

112

high risk of bias with score ≤6, medium risk of bias with a score of 7–10, and low risk of bias

113

when the score was ≥11. Each study was assessed for risk of bias independently by MA and MR.

114

Any disagreement in the risk of bias assessment was resolved by discussion to reach consensus

115

or by consulting UB and SA.

116

Data analysis

117

We performed data analysis using Revman (Review Manager version 5.3.5 Copenhagen,

118

The Nordic Cochrane Centre, 2014). Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the

119

pooled incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity with 95% confidence intervals. The

120

incidence for each individual study with its standard error (SE) adds to the study data in

121

RevMan. If the SE was not reported and the raw data could not be accessed, the SE was

122

calculated using the formula   1   / . Meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled

123

estimates of the time from disease onset to recurrent test positivity and the time from the last

124

negative test result to recurrent positivity.

125

Meta-analysis was also used to calculate the pooled relative risk (RR) of recurrent SARS-

126

CoV-2 positivity according to age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, other co-morbidities, disease

127

severity, body mass index (BMI), fever as the initial presenting compliant, days from onset to

128

negative conversion, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, and lung consolidation. We then assessed the

129

heterogeneity between studies using I2, with values of 25%, 50%, and 75% representing low,

130

moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.

135

articles did not report recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Of this, 21 full texts were assessed for

136

eligibility and 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).

137

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the finally selected studies. These studies were

138

published between Mar 17 and May 29, 2020. We included four non-peer-reviewed studies.

139

There was a total of 2,568 participants from all the studies combined, of which 318 experienced

140

recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Thirteen of the 14 studies were conducted in China and one

141

study was conducted in Brunei. Four of the Chinese studies were conducted in the city of Wuhan

142

and the rest were conducted in other cities. There were six studies (43%) with a cross-sectional

143

design, and four studies (29%) each with a retrospective cohort and prospective cohort design.

144

The most frequently used sample types were nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs alone

145

(46%), and the remaining studies used a variety of sample types including fecal, nasopharyngeal,

146

and oropharyngeal swabs. One study did not report the type of sample that was used.[10] The

147

median interval duration from disease onset to recurrence ranged from 21 to 50 days, while the

148

interval from the last negative to recurrent positive result ranged from 4 to 19 days. The risk of

149

bias was assessed as low in seven studies (50%), moderate in six studies (43%), and high in one

150

study (7%) (Supplementary Table 1).

151

The pooled estimate of the incidence of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81%

152

(95% CI: 11.44–18.19%) (Figure 2). Liu et al.[11] found the lowest incidence (7.33%, N=150),

153

and Li et al.[12] found the highest incidence (46.2%, N=13).

154

Seven studies provided results on the time from disease onset to recurrent positivity, and

155

eight studies provided results on the time from testing negative to recurrent positivity. The

156

pooled estimate of the interval from disease onset to recurrent positivity was 35.44 days (95%

157

CI: 32.65–38.24 days), and the pooled estimate of the last negative to recurrent positivity was

158

9.76 days (95% CI: 7.31–12.22 days) (Figures 3 and 4).

159

Patients with younger age were more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2

160

positivity (mean difference: −2.27, 95% CI: −2.95 to −1.80), but there was considerable

161

heterogeneity between studies in the effect of age (I2=99%). Patients with diabetes were less

162

likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.30-0.90, I2=53%).

163

Patients with severe COVID-19 were also less likely to experience recurrently positivity than

164

those with less severe disease (RR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.84, I2=70%). A longer interval from

165

disease onset to the last negative PCR result during the first admission was associated with a

166

greater risk of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity (mean difference: 8.24 days, 95% CI: 7.54–8.95

167

days, I2=98.9%). Patients with a low lymphocyte count (<1.1x109/L) had a higher risk of

168

experiencing recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39–0.86, I2=48%). We did

169

not find an association between sex, BMI, co-morbidity, hypertension, fever, lung consolidation,

170

or D-dimer and the risk of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity (Figure 5).

171
172

Discussion

173

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies involving 2,568

174

individuals. This is the first systematic review on recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity among

175

individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. The pooled estimate of the incidence of

176

recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 14.81%, confirming that recurrent positivity among

177

patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital is relatively common. The

178

persistence of SARS-CoV-2 protein in some patients with recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity may

179

be a sign of active viral replication and so these patients could still be infectious, although the

180

level of infectiousness of individuals with recurrent positivity requires further evaluation. No

181

studies in this review provided evidence of new infections in the family members or close

182

contacts of the recovered patients that experienced recurrent positivity. Several studies clearly

183

reported that there was no new infection infected from the patients with recurrent positivity, the

184

study reported by Lan et al.[13] found that there we no family members infected. However, these

185

results do not rule out the possibility that individuals with repeat positivity may still be infectious

186

because most patients are likely to have strictly obeyed self-isolation protocols, as described by

187

Zheng et al.[14]

188

We estimated that the interval between the onset of the initial episode of the disease and

189

recurrent positivity was 35.44 days. The longest interval (50 days) was reported by Chen.[15]

190

The time from the last negative PCR test result (used as a discharge criterion) to recurrent

191

positivity was 9.76 days, with the longest interval (19 days) being reported by Huang.[16]

192

Regarding the incubation period, Jing et al.[17] reported that the estimated median of incubation

193

period was 8.13 days and the 99th percentile was 20.59 days. Considering these findings, a

194

treatment protocol for follow-up and observation of recovered patients, should be implemented.

195

Strict self-isolation and routine PCR retesting, where feasible, on days 9 to 20 after discharge

196

should be considered. Routine retesting should also be considered 35 to 50 days from the onset

197

of the illness. Further study should be conducted to elucidate whether prolonged persistent and

198

recurrent RNA positivity still potentially infectious.

199

Prolonged viral shedding could be considered as the underlying mechanism of recurrent

200

positivity as false-negative PCR test results have been reported.[18–22] The estimated duration

201

of viral shedding based on the absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 20 days.[23]

10

202

However, the absence of nucleic acid alone cannot be used to determine whether viral shedding

203

occurred or potential infectiousness. Viral RNA could still be detected in a long time after the

204

disappearance of active virus,[24] and Yan et al.[25] categorized prolonged viral shedding with

205

the cut-off of 23 days.

206

Our review found that younger age, a longer length of stay during the initial illness, and

207

higher lymphocyte count was associated with an increased risk of recurrent positivity, while the

208

presence of diabetes mellitus, severe clinical disease were associated with a reduced risk. Several

209

studies have reported the determinants of prolonged viral shedding. A systematic review[26]

210

concluded that the use of corticosteroid was associated with delayed viral clearing. Another

211

review[27] reported that clearance of SARS-CoV-2 took longer in patients with gastrointestinal

212

disease than in those with respiratory disease, especially in children. A case series reported by

213

Huang et al. found that fecal specimens tended to have persistently detectable SARS-CoV-2 on

214

molecular tests for longer than other specimen types.[28] Another study[25] reported that in

215

adult patients, especially older patients had prolonged viral shedding, and that treatment with

216

lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with a shorter shedding period. Prolonged viral shedding has

217

also been reported to be associated with male sex, old age, concomitant hypertension, delayed

218

admission to hospital after illness onset, severe illness at admission, invasive mechanical

219

ventilation, and corticosteroid treatment.[29]

220

This review did not consider the underlying mechanism of the recurrent SARS-CoV-2

221

positivity; however, a previous non-systematic review[30] assessed possible mechanisms

222

underlying recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity and was unable to determine whether it was

223

attributable to false-negative results, reactivation, relapse or reinfection.

224

A study by Bao et al. give evidence that suggested that reinfection was unlikely. They

225

conducted trials on Rhesus macaques that were re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 on the early

226

recovery phase from initial infection characterized by weight loss, interstitial pneumonia, and

227

systemic viral dissemination mainly in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The results showed

228

that primary SARS-CoV-2 infection protects from subsequent reinfection.[31] Wang et al. also

229

reported that there is no infectious risk of COVID-19 patients with long-term fecal SARS-CoV-2

230

RNA positivity, and that there were no abnormalities in the gastrointestinal examination of these

231

patients after they had been discharged.[32] However, a case report from Italy by Loconsole et

232

al. described a case of a 48-year-old man with re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 after two

233

consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests following his discharge from the hospital. A

234

month after home quarantine, the man developed new symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain,

235

causing him to re-admitted and his SARS-CoV-2 RNA test was positive on his readmission,[33]

236

making it necessary to consider reinfection or recurrence (relapse) as possible mechanisms for

237

recurrent SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity on retesting. Further studies with larger sample sizes,

238

more longer follow-up, and more detailed measurements should be conducted to determine the

239

mechanisms underlying recurrent positivity.

240

Our meta-analysis produced large heterogenicity in some parameters reported; however,

241

a sub-group analysis and meta-regression could not be conducted to identify sources of between-

242

study heterogeneity in the pooled incidence estimates, because of insufficient study data. A

243

further review should be re-conducted once additional publications become available.

This systematic review provides evidence of SARS-CoV-2 recurrence of 14.81% among

247

COVID-19 patients. This review also provides pooled estimated time of onset to the re-

248

detectable positive duration was 35.44 days, and estimated time of the last negative to re-

249

detectable positive duration was 9.76 days. Patients with younger age, no history of diabetes,

250

mild and moderate severity, longer duration of onset to the last negative PCR, and higher

251

lymphocyte count are more likely to experience recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Strict self-

252

isolation for recovered patients should be well applied, and further studies should be conducted

253

to elucidate the possibility of infectious individuals with prolonged or recurrent RNA positivity.
