STRUCTURED ABSTRACT
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the sole causative
agent of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19).
Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients
between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in
COVID-19.
Results: A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149
patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease with complete resolution among survivors.
Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation
with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c ≤ 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.14-3.31), C-reactive protein > 88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23) and
lymphopenia < 1,000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78) at admission were independently associated with
30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission.
Conclusion:

Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-

inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are
independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.

1. INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel single-stranded
RNA virus [1], and it is considered the sole causative agent of the Coronavirus disease-2019
(COVID-19), which the World Health Organization granted with the pandemic status. Over
1,016,986 patients are currently dead after 34,161,721 confirmed cases worldwide [2]. Initial reports
have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can trigger an intense inflammatory response after dysregulation of
the host immune system. SARS-CoV-2 binds to a human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor
to gain intracellular entry [1] after it causes some protein and lipid conformational changes at the
edges of cholesterol-rich lipid domains [3].
Cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormones and bile acids and is an essential constituent of
cell membranes that facilitates signal transduction. It is considered a key mediator for cell invasion by
microbial pathogens, and the acute or chronic phases of infection can alter their levels. In particular,
in the acute phase of influenza infection, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) can gain some
pro-inflammatory properties [4]. On the other hand, lipid levels abnormalities have been described in
both human immunodeficiency virus [5] and hepatitis C virus [6] infections during their chronic
phases. The mechanism of alteration involves the virus to the Scavenger receptor B type 1 that
facilitates the selective uptake of HDL-c and other lipid components of receptor-bound HDL
particles, including free cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) [7]. Besides, membrane cholesterol is a
critical component to facilitate viral entry into host cells [8].
The role of lipid metabolism in coronavirus disease has been investigated even before the
current pandemic [9]. However, until now, little is known about the relationship between cholesterol
and SARS-CoV-2 viral infection or COVID-19. Herein, in this study, we explored whether SARSCoV-2 infection interferes with lipid metabolism and its prognostic during short-term follow-up.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Study design and population
We conducted this ambispective single-center study at a Spanish tertiary hospital (Hospital
Clínico Universitario de Valladolid, Spain, Valladolid). Between March 1st, 2020, and May 15th,
2020, data from a total of 654 consecutive patients with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infection confirmed through positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were
prospectively collected. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years old, pregnant women, and death in the
first 24 h after admission. We retrospectively collected the baseline clinical features, radiologic
procedures, and laboratory tests. We also recorded ongoing treatment and clinical outcomes from the
electronic medical records. Special attention was given to the accurate recording of the prescribed
therapy before admission and during hospital stay according to our institution’s protocols and
discretion of the medical team. Follow-up continued through until July 25th, 2020. The local ethics
committees approved the study protocol. Informed consent was waived, given the ambispective and
observational nature of the study. The work was carried out by following the guidelines of the
Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association.
2.2 Outcome measure
The primary endpoint was to investigate any relationship between serum levels of lipid
markers in the first hours of admission and all-cause mortality within 30-days. Secondary endpoints
were to determine (1) the correlation between lipid markers at admission with other inflammatory
markers and (2) to monitor the changes in lipid mediator’s levels during hospitalization as well as
their correlation with the prognosis.
Following the institution’s protocols, a blood sample with a metabolic and lipid profile was
drawn on the first 24 hours and the 7th day during admission according to medical criteria. We
assessed fasting total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density

lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglycerides (TG). We also recorded lipid profiles from the last
eighteen months before the index event and during follow-up at the discretion of the general
practitioner if available to evaluate lipid metabolism further.
2.3 Clinical laboratory tests
We carried out all tests at our certified clinical laboratory (ISO 9001:2015). White blood
cells, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts were performed on Sysmex XN-1000® analyzer using the
manufacture’s reagents (Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), LDL-c, HDL-c,
TC, and TG were tested on Roche Cobas 8100 sampling system analyzer (Module Cobas® c 702,
Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) using manufacture’s reagents. The methodology for direct LDL-c,
HDL-c, and TC methods are based on a standard homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric assay. We
tested interleukin 6 (IL6) on IMMULITE® 2000 immunoassay system using manufacture´s
luminescent immunoassay reagents (IMMULITE® 2000 IL6, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic,
Germany). Procalcitonin (PCT) measurement in plasma was performed by electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay on a chemistry analyzer (Cobas 6000, Roche Diagnostics) limit of detection, as below
0.02 ng/ml. We measured serum C-reactive protein (CRP) by particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric
(e501 Module Analyser, Roche Diagnostics). The limit of detection was set below 0.3 mg/L.
2.4 Statistical analysis
We reported categorical variables as absolute values and percentages. Continuous variables
were reported as median (interquartile range [IQR]). The normal distribution of continuous variables
was verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and q-q plot. Categorical variables were compared
with the chi-square test and the Fisher exact test when necessary. We compared continuous variables
with the Mann-Whitney U test. A Spearman test was performed to analyze the correlation between
lipid variables with the rest of the serum markers. We assessed the accuracy of analyzed variables to

identify non-survivors patients by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
analysis (AUROC). We determined the optimal operating point (OOP) in the AUROC as the one that
equaled sensitivity and specificity regarding mortality, and we used it as the cut-off point in the lipid
profiles. We analyzed time to 30-day mortality by Kaplan–Meier survival curves and compared using
the log-rank test. In a further step, we performed a multivariable Cox-regression analysis to determine
the predictors of 30-day mortality in the global study population. Proportional hazard assumptions
were verified by Shoenfeld residual test and check with using the log(-log(survival)) plots. We
performed the statistical analyses with the use of R software, version 3.6.1 (R Project for Statistical
Computing) and IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Differences were
statistically significant when the p-value was < 0.05.
3. RESULTS
3.1 Baseline and clinical characteristics.
Main baseline and clinical characteristics at admission are summarized in Table 1. A total of
654 patients were admitted due to COVID-19 with an estimated 30-day fatality rate of 22.8%. Nonsurvivors were older (82 vs. 66 years old; p<0.001), had lower baseline oxygen saturation levels at
admission (91 vs 95; p<0.001), developed a significant higher degree of respiratory failure (92.5% vs.
43.3%; p<0.001) and required ICU admission more frequently (20.3% vs. 8.1%; p<0.001) than
survivors. Non-survivors showed a greater prevalence of hypertension (74.5% vs. 46.7%; p<0.001),
diabetes mellitus (31.5% vs 17%; p<0.001), dyslypemia (52.3% vs. 34.3%; p<0.001) as well as other
comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (19.5% vs. 5.7%; p<0.001) or ischemic heart disease
(14.8% vs. 8.1%; p= 0.016). In accordance, non-survivors were more commonly treated prior to
admission with antihypertensive drugs, oral antidiabetics, antiplatelets and statins. Time from
symptom onset to admission was shorter (4 vs. 7 days; p<0.001) in the non-surviving cohort. They
also displayed greater levels parameters of organ damage and inflammation such as creatinine (1.16
vs. 0.81 mg/dL; p<0.001), D-dimer (1,394 vs. 664 ng/ml; p <0.001), C-reactive protein (128.4 vs.

54.5 mg/dL; p<0.001), procalcitonin (0.33 vs. 0.08 ng/mL; p< 0.001), LDH (357 vs. 265 UI/L;
p<0.001) and increased IL6 levels (52.1 vs. 18.4 pg/mL; p<0.001). In contrast, non-survivors had
lower blood count of haemoglobin [12.4 vs. 13.3 g/dL; p<0.001) lymphocytes [805 vs. 1,130
cells/mm³); p<0.001) and platelets [183 vs. 218 cells/mm³x103; p <0.001).
Specific COVID-19 treatment was more commonly prescribed in survivors with comparable
prescription rate in respect to statins (7.4% vs. 7.4%; p= 0.996) and corticosteroids (57.2% vs. 63.1%;
p= 0.202). Nosocomial infection (31.5% vs. 14.9%; p<0.001) were more common among nonsurvivors during hospitalization. Table 1 shows the main clinical outcomes and laboratory findings
during hospitalization.
3.2 Lipid profile among COVID-19 patients
Lipid profiles were tracked from previous laboratory reports before SARS-CoV-2 infection
(when available), at hospital admission, at 7th day during hospitalization, and until death or first-time
follow-up after discharge (see Figure 1 and Table 2). In the overall population (including survivors
and non-survivors), serological levels of all the lipid markers analyzed, except TG, displayed a
significant decrease at the time of admission concerning the previous baseline values. Besides,
baseline serum TC and LDL-c levels were significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors at any
time; whereas, HDL-c was comparable at admission but significantly lower in non-survivor before
(47.2 vs. 52.6 ng/dL; p = 0.004) and in the 7th day (27 vs. 34 mg/dL; p= 0.011) after hospital
admission. Survivors had a progressive recovery of TC, LDL-c, and HDL-c levels; however, this was
not the case in the non-survivor cohort. Finally, median follow-up among survivors was 73 days with
complete recovery to previous basal levels of their lipid profiles (see Figure 1 and Table 2).
3.3 Correlation of lipid markers with other inflammatory markers
A Spearman correlation analysis assessed the relationship of lipid parameters with all the
gathered analytical parameters. Interestingly, LDL-c and TC levels at admission were inversely
correlated with the levels of CRP (r= -0.217 and -0.209, respectively; p<0.001), PCT (r= -0.313 and -

0.229; p <0.001) and IL6 (r=-0.334 and -0.301; p<0.001) with a positive correlation with
lymphocytes (r=0.179 and 0.191; p= 0.001), which was maintained throughout hospitalization and
until recovery (see supplementary Table 1). LDL-c did show a very strong positive correlation with
TC (r= 0.937; p<0.001) as opposed to HDL-c (r= 0.201; p<0.001).
3.4 AUROC curve analysis.
We analyzed the diagnostic performance accuracy of lipid profiles to predict 30-day mortality
(see supplementary Figure 1). Only LDL-c and TC showed a significant AUROC during admission
and 7th day of hospitalization; in particular, LDL-c showcased better AUROC than TC regardless time
course of the disease. Hence, AUROC curve for LDL-c at admission was 0.7 (95% CI 0.64-0.75;
p<0.001) as opposed to TC with an AUROC of 0.67 (95% CI 0.63-0.71; p<0.001). On the 7th day,
AUROC for LDL-c and TC were 0,75 (95% CI 0.63-0.82; p<0.001) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.6-0.77;
p<0,001), respectively. The estimated threshold values for LDL-c were 69 mg/dl on admission and 75
mg/dl in the 7th day of hospitalization. On the contrary, TC estimated cut-off values were 132 mg/dL
and 147 mg/dL, respectively.
3.5 Association between mortality and lipid profile
Variables associated with 30-day mortality in multivariate analysis are summarized in Table
3. Independent predictors of mortality were estimated through a Cox multivariate regression analysis.
The variables included in the model were those with a p-value <0.05 on the univariate analysis (age,
hypertension, diabetes, dyslypemia, ischemic heart disease, chronic renal disease, angiotensin
receptor antagonist, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, lymphopenia, c-reactive
protein, antiviral treatment, anticoagulation, total cholesterol and LDL-c). It revealed that age (hazard
ratio [HR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.11]; p <0.001), lymphopenia <1,000 cells/ml
(HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.78; p<0.001), LDL-c <69 mg/dL (HR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.14-3.31; p = 0.014)
and CRP >88 mg/dL (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.23; p= 0.001) at admission were independent
variables associated with a greater risk of 30-day mortality. Those findings remained consistent on the
seventh day of hospitalization with a cut-off of 75 mg/dL and 33 mg/dL for LDL-c and CRP,

respectively. Unadjusted survival Kaplan-Meier curves for 30-day global mortality was performed
and shown in Figure 3, those patients with LDL-c levels <69 mg/dl at the time of admission and <75
mg/dl on the 7th day showed a 20% higher 30-day mortality rate than the rest of the patients.
4. DISCUSSION
Lipoproteins play a vital role in the innate immunity and perform different functions against
infection: receptor blocking, lysis, chemotaxis, and neutralization of bacterial endotoxins. Lipids are
essential for the replication and pathogenicity of enveloped viruses [10,11]. The main findings of this
research are: (1) the presence of immune-inflammatory mediated hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2
infection; and (2) the role of LDL-c as a potential prognostic marker in septic patients, COVID-19
patients with low LDL-c were more likely to die.
The mechanism behind the observed hypolipidemia is likely multifactorial and complex.
Serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and LDH increased moderately in non-surviving patients,
indicating mild liver-function damage, which might be a contributing factor to hypolipidemia by
disrupting uptake and biosynthesis of lipoproteins [12]. Nonetheless, a specific type of viral infections
can lead to alteration of lipid metabolism in the acute and chronic phases as a response of an ongoing
inflammatory state [4,5].
Although COVID-19 pathophysiology is not fully understood, COVID-19 severity and death
are associated with a hyperinflammatory state due to a dysregulated immune system [13]. The clinical
profile of the patients included in this study shows a similar trend with systemic inflammation being a
notable contributor to mortality, but also of SARS-CoV-2 mediated dyslipidemia. We have observed
a paradoxical lipid metabolism with a U-shaped curve of lipid levels with similar findings previously
described in inflammatory diseases [14]. Several are the plausible mechanism from an immunological
point of view.
HDL-c might become pro-inflammatory under specific conditions that increase reactive
oxygen species and myeloperoxidase activity. It can also modify their levels and Apoprotein-AI

concentration; hence, altered reverse cholesterol transport [4,15]. LDL-c can be oxidized when its
HDL-c counterpart loses its antioxidative properties, or if oxidized phospholipids accumulate. They
are identified as damaged-associated molecular patters (DAMPs) by scavenger receptors, activate the
inflammasome [4] and the immune system [13]. Low LDL-c levels may also be the consequence of
an increase in vascular leakage into the lung parenchyma as a result of endothelial damage [12,13].
Finally, an increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines may be responsible for a
drastic decrease in plasma LDL-c levels during the acute-phase response. Direct effects of cytokines
might explain the altered lipid concentrations [14] by up-regulating ox-LDL uptake or overriding
suppression of LDL-c receptor through the expression of scavenger receptors. These changes
observed with inflammation can increase the odds of cardiovascular disease through the formation of
foam cells and endothelial damage [15, 16].
Sepsis is defined as the presence of infection with a detrimental host response with organ
damage in the most critical cases [17]. Low HDL-c levels have been associated before with an
increased risk of sepsis [18,19] and adverse outcomes [20-23]. In fact, Maile et al. [24] or Guirgis et
al. [25] also suggested that low baseline LDL-c levels are associated with an increased risk of
mortality and sepsis, respectively. By analogy, similar findings should be identified in SARS-CoV-2
patients.
In particular, low HDL-c levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients have been associated with disease
severity [26, 27], but our results are in agreement with those of recently published where low LDL-c
levels were associated with COVID-19 severity [12,28]. However, we also observed an association
with an increased risk of mortality with low LDL-c levels after the adjusted multivariate analyses. By
contrast, a recent work by Walley et al. proposed that low LDL-c levels are merely an indicator of the
disease severity in septic patients without a contributing role in mortality [29].
The observed associated mortality in this cohort of COVID-19 patients may be explained by
other mechanism. In this sense, LDL-c carries a large percentage of plasma Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

that has significant antioxidant capacity, avoiding peroxidative damage to the cellular membranes
[30, 31]. Low LDL-c levels can cause a decrease in plasma CoQ10 levels, which can lead to
endothelial dysfunction, organ damage, and death as observed in COVID-19 patients [32]. All these
mechanisms justify that patients with low LDL-c levels have a reduced defensive, energetic and
metabolic reaction capacities to be able to properly manage a situation of aggression and organ stress
such as COVID-19, thus associating a significant increase in mortality.
Overall, low LDL-c levels may reflect the acute phase of the disease, but they may also
induce multiple systemic reactions through a complex interplay. Therefore, in the appropriate
scenario, we might hypothetically consider low LDL-c levels as a plausible candidate as a routine risk
marker during admission and also in the first weeks of disease evolution. Nevertheless, we cannot
rule out a catabolic state or high immune cell turnover as a cause of hypolipidemia in COVID-19
patients. The presence in our study of a statistically significant positive correlation between LDL-c
levels and lymphocyte count in blood, the latter being an independent variable associated with 30-day
mortality together with LDL-c in multivariate regression analysis, can support this theory.
Our work presents certain limitations. These observations should be considered hypothesisgenerating only due to the intrinsic retrospective nature of the present work. Moreover, the data were
subject to selection bias, and the generalizability of the results may be reduced by the fact that we did
not evaluate outpatients. We could not measure apoproteins or oxidized forms of main lipoproteins,
which may play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Finally, for better
characterization of this hypolipidemia, our findings should be validated in a large multicentric cohort
of COVID-19 patients monitoring the dynamics of lipid profiles before, during the acute phase and
follow-up.
In conclusion, our results suggest that COVID-19 hypolipidemia is associated with
inflammation; In particular, LDL-c could be used as a complementary marker in septic patients for
better risk stratification. Upcoming studies should determine to what extent treatment-related
