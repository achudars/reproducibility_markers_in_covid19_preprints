ABSTRACT

47

Background: The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound

48

impact on global healthcare. Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds

49

has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often

50

insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due

51

to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple

52

comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an

53

urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the

54

COVID-19 pandemic.

55

Methods and Analysis: The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to

56

investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service

57

provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the

58

Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) with the support of numerous national

59

(Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, British Society of Endovascular Therapy, British

60

Society of Interventional Radiology, Rouleaux Club) and an evolving number of international

61

organisations (Vascupedia, SingVasc, Audible Bleeding (USA), Australian and New Zealand

62

Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN)). The study has 3 ‘Tiers’: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular

63

surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their

64

hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the

65

pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-

66

pandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey

67

tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey® for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms

68

(Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap® for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis

69

to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed.

70

The analysis of Tier 2 and Tier 3 data will occur on completion of the study as per the pre-

71

specified statistical analysis plan.

INTRODUCTION:

100

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having an unprecedented effect on the

101

provision of healthcare services worldwide. The delivery of surgical care to patients during this time is

102

suffering as resources dwindle and hospital services are overwhelmed (1, 2). It is essential to document

103

the effect of this pandemic on the provision of vascular surgical services and the outcomes for vascular

104

patients to guide future guidelines and provide foresight for potential problems beyond the pandemic.

105

Vascular patients are, for the majority, considered high risk for respiratory compromise and subsequent

106

mortality if they contract COVID-19 (3, 4) They are often frail, elderly, comorbid, and have less

107

respiratory and physiological reserve than many others who contract the SARS-CoV2 virus (5). A

108

significant proportion of vascular surgical practice involves performing prophylactic operations to reduce

109

the risk of a future cardiovascular event, for example carotid endarterectomy to prevent stroke or

110

abdominal aortic aneurysm repair to prevent rupture. In addition, urgent or emergency surgical

111

intervention to prevent the loss of limb or life, often through an endovascular and/or open

112

revascularisation procedure, are commonplace.

113

Given the complex nature of vascular operations and the equally complex and co-morbid patient

114

population, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a particularly challenging situation for the vascular

115

surgeon. There is a delicate balance between the risk of a patient contracting or surviving COVID-19, the

116

availability of critical care and anaesthetic support needed to perform high-risk vascular interventions,

117

and the risk of limb loss, other significant morbidity or mortality for the patient from their presenting

118

condition if treatment is unduly delayed.

119

A major curtailment of vascular practice has already occurred, with many vascular institutions

120

postponing all but the most urgent surgery, choosing and endovascular surgical option where feasible,

121

delaying routine clinic appointments, and using telephone consultations much more frequently(6).

122

Given the unparalleled nature of the situation, there is an urgent need to quantify the impact of COVID-

123

19 on the provision of vascular surgical services, the adjustments made to vascular practice, and the

124

consequence to patient care.

125

The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) Study is a three-tiered study designed to capture global data on

126

vascular practice(s) during the pandemic including how practice evolves over time, the effect on

127

outcomes for patients presenting with, and/or receiving treatment for, vascular surgical conditions

128

during the pandemic and in the subsequent months of global recovery.

METHODS:

131

Overview of COVER

132

COVER will be run as a worldwide collaborative research project. It will be led by the UK-based Vascular

133

and Endovascular Research Network (VERN). VERN is an established vascular trainee research

134

collaborative, which has previously designed and delivered several projects across the UK and

135

internationally(7, 8). The project is formally supported by the Vascular Society of Great Britain and

136

Ireland (VSGBI), the British Society for Endovascular Therapy, the Rouleaux Club (the UK body

137

representing Vascular Surgery Trainees), the British Society of Interventional Radiology (BSIR) and BSIR

138

trainees (BSIRT). A number of international collaborators are also working with VERN (Vascupedia,

139

SingVasc, Australian and New Zealand Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN), Audible Bleeding (USA)) to

140

deliver this globally.

141

The overall study objective is to understand and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

142

global vascular practice and on outcomes for patients presenting with vascular problems or receiving

143

treatment for vascular conditions. The study has 3 ‘Tiers’: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to

144

capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures

145

data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture

146

any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-pandemic best practice.

147

Centres and individuals will be invited to participate in the COVER study which will be advertised via

148

VERN social media channels as well as via regional VERN representatives (doctors, nurses and other

149

healthcare professionals) and through our collaborative networks mailing lists. Engagement with each

150

tier of the project by each collaborator is anticipated and outlined below.

151

Centre eligibility

152

All hospitals and networks which provide cover for elective and emergency vascular patients.

153

Tier 1 - Changes to unit-level clinical processes

154

Primary objective

155

To objectively capture the changes made to the structure and delivery of vascular surgery at unit level

156

throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to the guidance provided by national and

157

international societies (e.g. VSGBI, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the European Society for Vascular

158

Surgery or the Society of Vascular surgery (SVS,USA)).

159

Methods

160

The Tier 1 “service evaluation study” will be circulated to all interested centres and data collected via an

161

online survey platform (SurveyMonkey®). This will be conducted upon each centre registering to

162

participate in the overall study bundle. This survey will be repeated at regular intervals to document

163

ongoing changes to unit practice in response to changing circumstances. The intervals between the

164

survey repeats will depend upon the progress of the pandemic. Collaborators will be updated regularly

165

regarding survey outcomes. Responses will reflect unit practice as a whole and should therefore be a

166

unified unit level response approved by the centre lead.

167

Outcomes

168

Primary outcome:

169

To document changes to structure and processes within vascular service, including:

170

•

186

Tier 2 – Vascular and Endovascular procedural data capture

187

Primary objective

188

This tier of the project is aimed at capturing data on all vascular and endovascular interventions being

189

undertaken throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. It is anticipated that the type and nature of vascular

190

procedures performed will change due to pressures on the wider healthcare service, with rationing of

191

resources, operating theatre and bed availability (including critical care), and anaesthetic support.

192

Methods

193

This will be undertaken for a 3-month period in the first instance. This time period is subject to change

194

depending on how the pandemic progresses.

195

Patient enrolment

196

Patients will be identified prospectively at the time of surgery. To ensure comprehensive data capture,

197

patients may also be identified retrospectively following an emergency procedure for example. All

198

patients receiving a vascular procedure are eligible for enrolment, including COVID-19 positive (+ve),

199

COVID-19 suspected and COVID-19 negative (-ve).

200

229

Tier 3 – Changes to acute vascular care management

230

Primary objective

231

Tier 3 is designed to capture modification to the management of all referred urgent vascular cases

232

during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify deviations from pre-pandemic best practice, standards

233

and/or guidelines for acute/urgent cases due to healthcare pressures or resource limitations. This will

234

focus on (but not be limited to) chronic limb-threatening ischaemia, symptomatic carotid disease, acute

235

aortic syndromes and aortic aneurysmal disease.

236

Methods

237

This will take place over a minimum of one month and will invite vascular specialists to complete an

238

anonymised proforma for every patient with any of the conditions listed above referred to the vascular

239

service. Timings may change based on the duration of the pandemic.

240

Patient enrolment

275
276

Tier 2 and Tier 3 data collection

277

Tier 2 and Tier 3 data (all anonymised and non-identifiable) will be collected and stored through a secure

278

UK National Health Service server using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) web application.

279

Designated collaborators at each participating site will be provided with REDCap project server login

280

details, allowing them to securely submit data on to the REDCap system. REDCap has previously been

281

successfully used for a range of other international cohort studies, including those led by GlobalSurg and

282

the European Society of Coloproctology. The REDCap server is managed by the University of

283

Birmingham, UK, with support provided by the GlobalSurg team.

284
285

Anonymised data will be collected relating to COVID-19 status, comorbidities, physiological state,

286

treatment, operation or intervention, and outcome. A unique identifier will be assigned to each patient

287

record. All participating centres will keep a record of patient details relating to the unique identifier for

288

the collection of medium- and long-term outcome data and linking to the original participant record on

289

REDCap

290
291

Analyses

292

As this is a non-interventional study, analysis will be limited to presentation of numbers and

293

proportions, with comparisons made to national and international standards. Interim analyses will be

294

performed periodically to inform data collection and provide up to date information on the impact of

295

the pandemic. The first formal analysis for Tier 2 will be performed once 50 patients have been entered

296

onto the database, and the frequency of subsequent analyses will be determined by the findings of this.

297

Hospital-level data will not be released or published by the VERN team, but individual centres will have

298

full access to their own data.

299

300

Ethical approval from the UK Health Research Authority has been obtained for Tiers 2 and 3, permitting

301

the capture of patient outcomes at 6 and 12 months (20/NW/0196 Liverpool Central, IRAS: 282224). The

302

study is registered with ISRCTN registry (80453162).

303

Participating centres in the UK will be required to seek local research and development approval. Non-

304

UK centres will need to obtain a research ethics committee or institutional review board approval in

305

accordance with national and/or local requirements. The principal investigator at each participating site

306

is responsible for obtaining necessary local approvals. Study organisational sponsorship is through the

307

315

316

DISCUSSION:

317

The COVER study has been designed as the first vascular trainee led, multi-national prospective study of

318

Vascular Surgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has several key points that will make it

319

increasingly relevant in the current climate. A high mortality has been reported in elective general

320

surgery patients who are COVID positive(10), which is concerning for the vascular patient population

321

who are at increased risk of succumbing to a COVID-19 infection owing to their older age, high levels of

322

smoking and background respiratory conditions, and comorbidities including diabetes. These factors

323

have all been linked to significantly reduced rates of survival in those that have contracted the SARS-

324

CoV2 virus. Pre-existing conditions also mean that if our patients are admitted to hospital, they are less

325

likely to be considered candidates for invasive ventilation due to the associated mortality reported(11).

326

In addition, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is emerging as a presenting complaint for COVID-19

327

infection and will impact on vascular been observed; however it is unclear if this is a reduction in self-

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.20114322; this version posted May 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

328

referrals to primary care due to fear of coming into hospital, or gatekeeping being performed by

329

referring teams.

330

There is a familiarity within vascular surgery with the consequences of delays in presentation for key

331

conditions such as acute aortic pathologies and CLTI, leading to fewer treatment options and poorer

332

prognosis. As the pandemic progresses and elective operating is curtailed or stopped completely, there

333

will be a growing list of patients who will require urgent surgery in the post-pandemic period once

334

‘normal’ service has resumed. This study will address the consequence of delaying surgery considered

335

urgent or essential, and an understanding of the vascular caseload volume that is accumulating during

336

the pandemic period that will need to be appropriately managed once the crisis has passed.

337

Through well-structured and purposeful collaborative working the VERN group developed and

338

submitted the COVER study for ethical approval. This has been granted promptly to facilitate COVID-19

339

related research within vascular surgery. Similarly, the global vascular community has responded

340

positively and over 150 centres have already participated in Tier 1 and registered interest for the other

341

tiers across the globe indicating the support and global appeal of the study.

342

VERN and the COVER study has a strong trainee focus with the opportunity for trainees to contribute

343

high quality data from their own centres. From previous work(14) we have been able to demonstrate

344

that trainees are highly motivated to participate in research when their efforts are recognised and

345

PubMed citable(14). This has been echoed by global collaborative studies such as those run by

346

GlobalSurg[(15) (https://globalsurg.org/), conducted under a single author name and listing all those

347

individuals who have contributed as co-authors.

348

The protocol has been designed with the support of the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland,

349

who recognise the value and importance of accurate data collection during this period. The study data

350

collection tools have been developed in close co-operation with our colleagues in Europe, the USA and

351

Australia, to ensure questions are applicable and that possible answers reflect variations in practice

352

around the globe. It has also helped to ensure that information is collected in sufficient depth to

353

correlate with key outcomes at 6 and 12 months, without being onerous.

354

The study also benefits from the ongoing public dissemination of international vascular guidelines to

355

support clinicians managing the current COVID-19 crisis. This will enable comparison of real time

356

changes in practice against emerging and evolving guidelines. Furthermore, the availability of various

357

national registries, that have benchmarked ‘normal’ practice and ‘expected’ condition-specific outcomes

358

for key parameters against which there can be a detailed comparison of COVER study-reported practices

359

and outcomes. Data points relating to patient, technical and peri-operative variables will also be

360

compared between countries and wider regions to explore how differences in populations and practice

361

may impact on disease specific outcomes at 6 and 12 months.

362

Tier 1 has already collected valuable real-time data which has been used to inform those who create and

363

disseminate national guidelines. Promoting inclusion amongst the global vascular trainee community

364

will also play a role in professional development, research skills and achievements which would not

365

otherwise be available.

366

367

Study limitations

368

COVER is a pragmatic real-world study. The nature of the current pandemic has meant that an

369

appropriate sample size is difficult to calculate. Additionally, the dynamic nature of the COVID-19

370

pandemic means that numbers of cases, including those testing positive for or suspected to have

371

infection with the SARS-CoV2 virus - hence a denominator for some calculations - are unknown. This

372

insurmountable problem is not limited to this study and is currently frustrating efforts to determine

373

appropriate strategies for lifting the lockdown in countries where the peak of the pandemic appears to

374

have passed.

375

Many countries have scaled back elective practice and changed thresholds for operating on carotid

376

stenosis and aortic aneurysms to varying degrees and along different timelines due to resource

377

scarcities. This will have an impact on the volume of cases uploaded into Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the study,

378

but the concurrent completion of Tier 1 should reflect this and has already provided live data from over

379

150 institutions in 45 countries across the globe. In the first instance, country-specific experiences have

380

been shared to highlight practice changes around the globe with vascular colleagues. This information

381

will also be used when analysing country-specific trends for surgery and referrals. This will allow

382

inclusion of important variables such as type of hospital (private or government-run), loss of specialty

383

firms with the redeployment of staff to support other specialties; the exact timing for milestones such as

384

stopping screening programmes for aortic aneurysm, or moving to a practice of mainly best medical

385

therapy for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

387

Success of the COVER study will provide the global vascular community with robust data on the impact

388

of the COVID-19 pandemic on our patients and the future legacy of delayed surgery and adjusted

389

decision making. It will support further collaboration between vascular trainees globally, bringing

390

together and recognising efforts to collaborate with colleagues around the world.
