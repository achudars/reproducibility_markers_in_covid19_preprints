Abstract
Background: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been described as a potential treatment
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there are safety concerns regarding its QT interval
and pro-arrhythmic effects.
Objective: This trial aimed to determine the predictors of QT interval prolongation and
pro-arrhythmic effects in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving
HCQ.
Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of 45 critically-ill patients
hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treated with 800 mg of HCQ at day
1 and 400 mg on days 2–5. Clinical aspects and outcomes, basal and final corrected QT
(QTc) interval, and the incidence of arrhythmias and arrhythmogenic death were
observed. Independent predictors of QTc prolongation were identified using
multivariable logistic regression analysis. QT interval prolongation was considered
substantial at final QTc ≥ 480 ms.
Results: The mean age was 60.9 ± 16.67 years and 28 (62.2%) patients were men. Basal
QTc was 442 ± 28 ms, and the final QTc interval was 458 ± 34 ms, for a mean QTc
interval variation of 15 ± 11 ms. There was no arrhythmogenic death. The need for
hemodialysis remained a statistically significant predictor of QT interval enlargement
(odds ratio, 10.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 – 102.18; p = 0.045).
Conclusions: HCQ promotes mild to moderate QT interval prolongation. The risk of QT
interval prolongation is higher among patients with acute renal failure requiring
hemodialysis.

Introduction
The urgent need for a treatment response for the COVID-19 pandemic led to the “offlabel” use of medications, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which
was supported by in vitro trials1 and minor clinical trials,2 but remain under evaluation in
larger randomized clinical trials. In Brazil, the use of HCQ alone or associated with the
macrolide antibiotic azithromycin was designated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health
only for severe cases of respiratory failure in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.3
However, each of these medications has the potential to lengthen the QT interval on the
electrocardiogram (ECG) and lead to severe ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades
de pointes (TdP) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT); furthermore, taken
together, there is a risk of synergic effect.4
SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to respiratory and renal failure, prothrombotic status,
and myocardial injury, which may precipitate worsening of heart failure, acute
myocardial infarction (AMI), and cardiac arrhythmias.5,6,7 Hence, the pro-arrhythmic
effects of this treatment regimen might be potentially heightened in the critically-ill form
of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, requiring proper investigation in this subset of patients.
Thus, we conducted an observational retrospective study of 45 patients critically ill with
SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to evaluate the safety of the proposed treatment as well
as its effect on the QT interval in this specific subset of patients.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted an observational retrospective study utilizing data from patients treated
with HCQ, as indicated for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe respiratory
failure according to the first protocol designated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in
the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study was submitted to the hospital’s ethics committee and approved. Since the study
was retrospective and observational, no informed consent was required.
Patient Selection
Since the beginning of the outbreak until May 20, 2020, 45 patients critically ill with
SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated with HCQ at our institution.
The inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and critically ill clinical
condition. The parameters to define the critical condition, indication for HCQ, and drug
dosage are summarized in Table 1.
Exclusion criteria included mild or moderate forms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection or
suspected cases of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation.
Electrocardiogram Analysis
For the electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, values from the baseline ECG, including
heart rate (HR), QRS duration, and morphology as well as measured and corrected QT
(QTc) interval, were collected for each patient before the treatment. The QT interval was
manually measured from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave. QT
intervals were measured in Lead II. If the QT interval could not be measured in lead II,
leads V5 or V6 were alternatively used. Bazzet’s formula was used to calculate the QTc
interval. If the patient presented with left bundle branch block (LBBB), Yankelson’s
formula was employed.
The hospital’s evaluation protocol included ECG recordings on the 2 nd and 4th days of
treatment as well as on the first day after the end of treatment regimen (6th day). For
patients in critical condition for whom ECG performance was not feasible, monitor
recordings were obtained on a daily basis, with viability to measure the heart rate (HR)
and QT interval. The QTc interval was measured and calculated by a certified

electrophysiologist. Pre-specified criteria for QTc interval prolongation was defined as a
final QTc ≥480 ms.
Predictor Variables
Patient data, including demographic parameters, comorbidities, use of concomitant
medications, and time since the onset of symptoms until patient admission, were
analyzed. The clinical characteristics at admittance, taking into account the oxygenation
upon arrival and the presence of lung compromise on CT scan, were noted. The inhospital evolution was also evaluated, including the need for intensive care unit (ICU),
mechanical ventilation (MV), hemodialysis, vasoactive drugs, and laboratory testing
during the HCQ treatment regimen. Any incidence of aborted cardiac arrest, acute
myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmias, arrhythmogenic death, and/or patient mortality was
also noted.
Concomitant QT interval prolonging agents during treatment were also noticed. Any
premature discontinuation of the treatment regimen due to QT prolongation was extracted
from medical records. HCQ was frequently associated with azithromycin, which also
might lengthen the QT interval. Because of the high rate of association between these two
drugs, azithromycin was analyzed separately from other concomitant QT prolonging
drugs.
Five patients could not have their final QTc determined, three due to poor clinical
evolution and inability to undergo an ECG or proper cardiac monitor registry, and two as
a result of premature discharge. However, these patients were maintained within the
report due to their clinical evolution and laboratory data as well as clinical outcomes.

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD values for numeric variables with normal distribution,
median (interquartile range [IQR]) for numeric variables with non-parametric
distribution, and percentage (absolute frequency) for categorical variables. Comparisons
of characteristics between patients with and without a final QTc ≥480 ms were made
using Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-Square tests for normal numeric variables,
non-parametric numeric variables, and categorical variables, respectively. QTc variation
before and after the treatment regimen was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The
relationship among the quartile ranges was compared using Student’ s t-test.
Independent predictors of QTc prolongation were identified using multivariable logistic
regression analysis. On univariate analysis, p values ≤0.10 were considered to estimate
possible predictors. Subsequently, these predictors were evaluated on multivariate
analysis, and p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Multivariate
analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Statistical analyses were performed using R Software Version 4 for Mac (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Auckland, NZ).
Results
The evolution and baseline characteristics of the 45 patients are displayed in Table 2. The
mean age was 60.9 ± 16.67 years-old, and 28 (62.2%) of the patients were men. The most
common comorbidity was hypertension (51.1%). Coronary heart disease was present in
13.3% of the patients and diabetes in 28.8% of patients. Two patients (4.44%) presented
with end-stage renal disease and chronically required renal substitution therapy with
hemodialysis.

The time since the onset of symptoms was 5.75 ± 3.01 days, and the time between hospital
admittance and the initiation of the treatment regimen was 2.0 (IQR, 1.0–4.0) days.
Concomitant medication that could lengthen the QTc interval was present in 33.3% of
patients, and included antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiarrhythmics, such as
amiodarone. As for the treatment regimen, 82.2% received HCQ plus azithromycin, while
17.8% received only HCQ.
At admittance, signs of respiratory failure were found in most patients, with a mean
oxygen saturation of 88% (IQR, 85–90%). All patients presented with altered CT scans,
showing signs of viral pneumonia. Among this patient subset, 93.3% required an ICU
stay and 71.2% required mechanical ventilation. Of those admitted to the ICU, 66.7%
received vasoactive drug support and 51.1% required renal substitution therapy with
hemodialysis. Acute heart failure evolved in 6.67% of the patients and the same
percentage presented with non-arrhythmic aborted cardiac arrest (pulseless electrical
activity or asystole). The overall mortality rate was 26.6%.
The basal QTc interval was 442 ± 28 ms, and the final QTc interval was 458 ± 34 ms, for
a mean QTc interval variation of 15 ± 11 ms. The Shapiro-Wilk test showed normal data
distribution (p = 0.7173), and the bilateral t-Student’s test showed a statistical difference
between the basal and final QTc intervals (p = 0.018). Among the 40 patients with a final
QTc measure, 11 (27.5%) presented with a final QTc interval ≥480 ms, and 4 (10%)
presented with QTc interval ≥500 ms. Four patients (10%) showed a  QTc ≥60 ms. The
QTc interval distribution, density, and variation before and after the treatment regimen
are depicted in Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Four patients (8.8%) experienced an interrupted treatment regimen. One because of
significant prolongation in QTc, one for a non-disclosed reason, and two because of

medical preference.
Incidental Arrhythmias
No patient presented with TdP or any other ventricular polymorphic tachycardia during
or after the treatment regimen. There were no arrhythmogenic deaths. As previously
described, aborted cardiac arrests were non-arrhythmic (pulseless electrical activity or
asystole).
Seven patients (15.5%) presented with arrhythmias during or immediately after the
treatment regimen. One patient presented with frequent premature ventricular
contractions (PVC) and ventricular bigeminy. Six patients (13.3%) presented with
supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), two with atrial fibrillation, two with atrial flutter, and
two showed paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Most arrhythmias were
hemodynamically stable and were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Atrial flutters were
treated with synchronized electrical cardioversion.
As for conduction disturbances, one patient presented with right bundle branch block and
one presented with left bundle branch block during the treatment regimen.
Logistic Regression Model
In the univariate analysis, p values ≤0.10 were considered for multivariate analysis. The
data are shown in Table 3. Age, sex, previous heart disease, and the use of QT prolonging
medications were not significant predictors of a final QTc ≥480 ms. Comorbidities were
separated into two groups: none/one, and two or more, and were also not significant
predictors of a final QTc ≥480 ms. Azithromycin use, oxygen saturation at admission,
acute heart failure, vasoactive drug use, and aborted cardiac arrest were also not
significant predictors of a prolonged final QTc.

However, acute renal failure with increasing creatinine values and the requirement of
renal substitution therapy with hemodialysis were statistically significant predictors of
prolonged QTc, as were elevated troponin levels and low levels of potassium (K) and
magnesium (Mg). The baseline QTc interval also reached statistical significance. These
variables were then subjected to multivariate analysis utilizing logistic regression, which
is presented in Table 4.
The need for hemodialysis remained a significant predictor of QT prolongation ≥480 ms,
even after adjustment for confounding factors, such as K and Mg values, azithromycin,
comorbidities, and QTc-prolonging medications (OR, 10.34; 95% CI, 1.04–102; p =
0.045).
In addition, for each 1 mg/dL increase in creatinine levels, the risk for a final QTc ≥480
ms increased by 1.88 (95% CI, 0.97–3.6; p = 0.06). Although nearly significant, we think
it is important to emphasize this data, as the clinical implications might be important, and
the lack of significance is probably due to the small sample size. K, Mg, and troponin
levels, as well as baseline QTc were not statistically significant predictors of final QTc
≥480 ms in multivariate analysis (Table 4).
Discussion
This report demonstrates that a hemodialysis requirement is a strong predictor for QT
interval prolongation in critically-ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with
HCQ. Acute renal failure and an increase in creatinine levels are possible predictors as
well, as it neared significance, showing 1.88-fold risk for each 1 mg/dL increase in
creatinine level. Concomitant QT prolonging medications and azithromycin association
were not predictors for enlargement of the QT interval.

Although the arrhythmogenic risk of ventricular arrhythmias and TdP is markedly higher
when QTc intervals are ≥500 ms, current reports and guidelines determine that QTc
intervals longer than 480 ms are diagnostic of long QT syndrome, and should raise
concern when monitoring drug-induced QTc.8,9 Moreover, Mercuro et al. reported a TdP
episode in a patient with a QTc interval of 499 ms, treated with hydroxychloroquine.10
Thus, in this study, a cutoff of 480 ms was established for QT enlargement.
HCQ Pharmacokinetics and Immunomodulatory Effects
Although used in clinical practice for almost 65 years, the 4-aminoquinolines antimalarial
agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine11 had never received the level of scrutiny as
they have in the COVID-19 pandemic, since in vitro and anecdotal clinical trials showed
antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.1,2
HCQ has immunomodulatory properties and has been used in rheumatologic diseases,
such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)12 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).13 HCQ is a
weak base, with complex pharmacokinetics and a large volume of distribution,
metabolized in the liver in active metabolites.11 Urinary excretion is variable, accounting
for 20–40% of the total elimination of the medication, including the unchanged drug and
its active metabolites.11,12 Corroborating the findings in our trial, acidosis and impaired
renal function are known clinical conditions that may increase the plasma concentration
of the drug, leading to potential adverse effects, such as QT interval prolongation and
TdP.11
General Effects of HCQ in the Cardiovascular System
The cardiovascular effects of HCQ have been reported with divergent data. Liu et al
published a meta-analysis involving 19 observational studies and 19,679 patients,

showing a 30% reduction in cardiovascular risk, and reported favorable changes in the
lipid profile.14 Mathieu et al. corroborated these findings with another meta-analysis
involving 24,923 HCQ users and 36,327 non-users, demonstrating low diabetes incidence
among HCQ users and a nearly significant decrease in the occurrence of cardiovascular
events in the HCQ group.15 However, Chartre et al. showed, in a systematic review,
cardiac complications with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use. Although reporting
data from a reduced population (127 patients), with outcomes extracted from case reports
and short series of cases and only 39.4% patients using HCQ, they demonstrated serious
cardiovascular events associated with the chronic use of these drugs, such as conduction
disorders occurring in 85% of patients, and heart failure in 26.8% of patients undergoing
chronic treatment.16 This study showed no heart failure or other mechanical events
attributable to HCQ, probably because of the short-term treatment. However, conduction
disturbances were noted, such as right and left bundle branch block, even with such shortterm use.
HCQ, QT interval, and Arrhythmias
It is well known that chloroquine and HCQ prolong the QTc interval by blocking the
inward K rectifier current (IKr), acting on the hERG channel.17 Besides promoting mild
to moderate prolongation in QT interval, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been
linked to TdP.17,18
Nonetheless, reports in the literature are conflicting regarding the amount of QT interval
enlargement and the incidence of ventricular polymorphic tachycardias, such as TdP,
especially during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Saleh et al. showed that the association of
HCQ and azithromycin is safe for the treatment of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV2 infection, with no arrhythmic events, and despite a significant increase in the QT

interval, discontinuation of the treatment regimen only occurred in 3.5% of patients.19
These findings are similar to those reported by Bun et al., who showed that in 73 patients
hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were no drug-induced life-threatening
arrhythmias, with a discontinuation rate due to QTc interval prolongation in 2.8% of
patients.20 Cavalcanti et al. also showed that, in patients with mild to moderate SARSCoV-2 infection, prolongation of the QTc interval ≥480 ms was more frequent in patients
treated with HCQ, with or without azithromycin; however, there was no significant rise
in arrhythmia incidence under this treatment regimen.21
However, Borba et al. showed that a high dosage of chloroquine (600 mg twice a day for
10 days) is associated with poor outcomes, with 18.9% patients a showing a QTc interval
prolongation ≥500 ms and 2.7% experiencing ventricular tachycardia before death, but
without a record of TdP.22 This is an important trial showing the effects of 4aminoquinolines on the QT interval. In our trial, patients were treated with HCQ, known
for carrying less arrhythmogenic effects than chloroquine,16 and administered in a much
lower dosage. Nonetheless, the use of different doses of chloroquine as well as the clinical
suspicion, not confirmation, of SARS-CoV-2 infection used as inclusion criteria, limit
the capability of this trial for comparison.
Regarding proper HCQ use and arrhythmic events, Chorin et al. reported, in 251
inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a high incidence of QT interval prolongation
(23%), with basal QTc = 439 ± 29 ms to 473 ± 36 ms on day 4 of the treatment regimen
with HCQ plus azithromycin. One patient (0.4%) presented with TdP and required
electrical cardioversion.23 Confirming the findings in our trial, renal function worsened
by 33% on the day of maximum QT interval measurement.23 Moreover, as previously
described, Mercuro’s trial reported a TdP episode in a patient with a QTc interval of 499
ms who had been treated with hydroxychloroquine.10

HCQ and Predictors for QT Enlargement and TdP
Our findings are similar to the report by Hooks et al., who showed that in 819 patients
treated for rheumatologic diseases, HCQ use is associated with QT interval prolongation,
and a significant risk of prolongation is related to a clinical history of chronic kidney
disease (CKD). They also reported that atrial fibrillation and heart failure are risk factors
for QT enlargement.24
Maraj et al. reported similar rates of QT prolongation (23%) compared with our trial
(27.5%) among inpatients treated with HCQ plus azithromycin for SARS-CoV-2
infection.25 This study showed that 14% of patients had a QTc interval ≥500 ms, and there
was one case of TdP. Among other risk factors, this report demonstrates that 43% of
patients presenting with significant QTc interval prolongation had baseline renal
insufficiency or developed acute renal failure, corroborating the findings in our trial.25
Interestingly, Tsidale and colleagues developed a risk score to predict QT interval
prolongation in hospitalized patients that does not contemplate renal dysfunction as
predictor of QT enlargement.26 However, regarding drugs with moderate to significant
renal excretion, this might be a decisive parameter to consider. Drawing attention to this
matter, the 2010 Scientific Statement of the American Heart Association for the
prevention of TdP in hospital settings addresses the burden of renal dysfunction as a risk
factor for TdP, advising clinicians to monitor the QTc interval and electrolyte variations
closely, especially in patients receiving drugs with long half-lives and substantial renal
excretion.27 The findings of this study are in accordance with such recommendations.
Current HCQ Use for Covid-19 and Other Possible Employments in Critical Patients
Several reports did not show improvement in clinical status under chloroquine or HCQ

treatment for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection21,22,28. Consequently, these drugs are
not approved as first line therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazil anymore.
Despite that, it is important to recognize the arrhythmogenic effects of such treatment in
this subset of patients, as well as its predictors, to prevent rare but catastrophic lifethreatening arrhythmias. Furthermore, HCQ might be utilized for other critical conditions
such as SLE patients with end-stage renal disease29, lupus nephritis30, as well as anticancer therapies31,32. Clinicians treating this conditions must be aware that patients
presenting with renal dysfunction and needing substitutive renal therapy with
hemodialysis are at risk for QT interval enlargement and its associated arrhythmias.
Although previous trials described more frequent prolongation of QT interval during
renal dysfunction, hemodialysis need in the critically-ill patient has not been reported as
an independent predictor of QT interval enlargement yet. Therefore, we believe it is
important to describe and emphasize that worsening in renal function requiring
substitutive renal therapy with hemodialysis is an independent predictor for QT interval
enlargement under HCQ treatment.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective observational trial, with
a non-randomized sample of patients. The treatment was not homogeneous between the
patients, and 17.8% of patients were treated only with HCQ without azithromycin.
Moreover, the sample size, although large enough to demonstrate hemodialysis as a
predictor of QTc lengthening, was not large enough to show that acute renal failure and
elevated creatinine levels are also statistically significant predictors, despite the fact that
it can be inferred, reaching nearly significance.

Furthermore, the inability to measure the final QTc interval in five patients might also
affect the outcomes, given the reduced sample size. The ECG review by only one
electrophysiologist might also have contributed to measuring bias. Lastly, we did not
assess serum drug concentrations.
Conclusions
Despite great controversy, HCQ has been used in a large number of patients in critically
ill clinical conditions with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Knowledge of the pharmacological
effects of this drug in this subset of critically-ill patients is very important not only in the
case of COVID-19 treatment, but also in other critically ill clinical conditions, such as
SLE patients with end-stage renal disease, lupus nephritis and severe cases of malaria.
This trial demonstrates that HCQ promotes mild to moderate lengthening in the QT
interval in most cases. However, patients with renal function impairment and those
evolving with the need for substitution renal therapy with hemodialysis are at risk for
serious QT prolongation, and should be monitored more closely. Avoidance of electrolyte
disturbances and careful continuous measurement of the QT interval are crucial.
Despite these findings, larger, randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the safety
and efficacy of HCQ in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
