Abstract
The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modeled
using exponential growth models. However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential
model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives,
we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive

5

cases and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing
effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modeling approach is close to the SIQR (SusceptibleInfectious-Quarantined-Recovered) model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size)
in positive cases, actives cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19
outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible

10

growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data.

Introduction

The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus strain SARS-nCOV2 has emerged
from Wuhan, China (Giordano et al., 2020, Velavan and Meyer, 2020). The COVID-19 outbreaks
totalize 21 026 758 cases and 755 786 deaths across the world on August 15, 2020 (WHO, 2020).

The worldwide social as well as economic ravages by COVID-19 has immediately motivated the use
of mathmatical models for understanding the course of the epidemic and planning effective control
strategies. These include for instance the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered), SEIR (Susceptible,

20

Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) and its variants, SIDR (Susceptible- Infectious-Recovered-Dead) and
SIQR (Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered) models (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020, Casella,
2020, Kucharski et al., 2020, Pedersen and Meneghini, 2020). These modeling approaches use mechanistic
models which incorporate key physical laws or mechanisms involved in the dynamics of the population at
risk and the pathogen (Chowell, 2017). A second class of approaches uses empirical phenomenological

25

models which does not require specific knowledge on the physical laws or mechanisms that give rise to
the observed epidemic data (Chowell et al., 2016), and has been considered for instance by Agosto and
Giudici (2020) for understanding both short and long term dynamics of COVID-19.
When facing an epidemic outbreak, public health officials are mostly interested in data driven, mathematically motivated, practical and computationally efficient approaches that can for instance i ) generate

30

estimates of key transmission parameters, ii ) gain insight to the contribution of different transmission
pathways, iii ) assess the impact of control interventions (e.g. social distancing, test + isolation, vaccination campaigns) and iv ) optimize the impact of control strategies, and v ) generate short and long-term
forecasts (Chowell, 2017). In regard to the current COVID-19 outbreak (2020), politics and public health
officials are mostly worried about the ability of the disease to induce saturation of the health system,

35

reducing the survival of patients even consulting for reasons different from the epidemic itself. High
interest is thus currently given to accurate forecasting of the epidemic peak time and size, epidemic
size and duration, as well as their sensitivity to control interventions in order to optimize the impact of
control strategies.
An exponential-growth model is usually assumed to characterize the early phase of epidemics. But this

40

assumption can lead to failure to appropriately capture the profile of epidemic growth and give rise to
non realistic epidemic forecasts (Chowell and Viboud, 2016, Spencer and Golinski, 2020). In an ultimate
view to guide control interventions aiming to limit the spread of epidemics, with focus on the COVID-19
pandemic, this work considers a flexible growth curve fitting approach for understanding the dynamics
of epidemics. We use the generic growth model of Turner et al. (1976) to model the course of reported
positive cases and a binomial regression to model removals (recoveries and deaths) and then infer the
overall dynamics of the epidemic, in terms of observables (reported cases, active/quarantined cases) and
unobservables (new infections, lost cases), and predict interest quantities such as the peak (time and size)
in reported cases, active cases and new infections. The performance of the approach is assessed through

an application to daily case reporting data from Italy which has virtually completed a whole COVID-19

outbreak wave and thus offers the possibility to compare predicted outputs to real events.

Methods

We consider a growth curve approach for modeling the course of an epidemic along time. We follow
Chowell et al. (2020), Chowell (2017), Spencer and Golinski (2020) who among others used growth models
for forecasting epidemic dynamics.

2.1

Structural model for epidemic incidence

Let Ct denote the size of the detected infected population at time t, i.e. the cumulative number of
infected, identified and isolated individuals. We assume for convenience that Ct is continuous and denote
Ċt its first derivative with respect to t. Also let It be the true size of infectives at t, related to Ct
through

60

Ċt = δt It

(1)

where δt ∈ (0, 1] is the detection rate which is closely related to the testing effort (number of tests,
tracing of contact persons of identified cases and targeting exposed people) and is assumed at least twice
differentiable with respect to t. We ressort to the generic growth model of Turner et al. (1976) for the
identified positive cases:
Ct = K(1 + ut )−1/ν
−1/ρ

with ut = [1 + νωρ(t − τ )]

(2)

. In (2), K > 0 is the ultimate epidemic size (detected), ω > 0 is the

65

“intrinsic” growth constant, ν and ρ are powers (ν > 0 and −1 < ρ < ν −1 ) characterizing respectively
the rates of change with respect to the initial size C0 = δ0 I0 (number of cases detected at time t = 0)
and the ultimate size K, and τ is a constant of integration, determined by the initial conditions of the
h
i−1/ν
−1/ρ
epidemic and implicitly the detection rate δ0 through C0 = K 1 + (1 − νωρτ )
for ρ =
6 0 and
C0 = K (1 + eνωτ )

−1/ν

for ρ = 0. The growth model (2) is quite flexible to handle various shapes of

epidemic dynamics. Indeed, if K → ∞ and νρ → 0, (2) specializes to the exponential growth model
Ct = eω(t−τ )

(3)

where ω is the exponential growth rate. Apart from (3), other special or limiting cases of (2) include the
hyper-Gompertz (ν → 0 while ων 1+ρ is constant) and the Gompertz (ν → 0, ρ → 0 while ων is constant),

2.2

Active cases and outcomes

The number At of detected and active cases along an epidemic outbreak is of high interest for public
health officials. Indeed, At must be kept under the carrying capacity of the health system to avoid
overload and disrupture. The derivative Ȧt of the detected and active cases satisfies
Ȧt = Ċt − Rt

80

(5)

where Rt = αt At denotes the number of removed and permanently immune (mortality and recovery) at
time t, and αt is the unit time removal probability, i.e. the odds for having an outcome (recovery or death),
averaged over the active cases. Equation (5) fits in the SIQR (Susceptible, Infectious, Quarantined,
Recovered) model framework (Hethcote et al., 2002) with the detected actives cases referred to as
“quarantined” and the strong assumption that αt is constant along the epidemic outbreak (see the third

85

equation in system (6) in Hethcote et al. (2002)). The removal probability can more generally be given
the logistic form αt =

eηt
1+eηt

with ηt = Xt>β + κt where Xt = (Xt1 , Xt2 , · · · , Xtq )> is a vector of q

covariates (known constants) and β is the q vector of associated effects, and κ determines the change in
the log-odds ratio for having an outcome per unit time. These changes in αt can be due to an improve in
the health care system during the epidemic outbreak (increase in recovery ratio) or a deterioration of the

90

health care system for infected individuals (increase in mortality ratio due to the outbreak). The general
solution of the differential equation (5) turns to have the form

There are no general closed form solutions for the integrals in (6), unless Ċt and αt are purposely chosen
as functions of time to simplify the integral. At can however be obtained in practice from (6) using a
numerical integration routine such as the function integrate in R freeware (R Core Team, 2019) or the

100

function integral of Matlab (MATLAB, 2016). To nevertheless circumvent this issue during estimation
under the generic growth model (2), we discretized the active cases At by assuming a binomial removal
process Rt conditional on the detected unit time new cases Yt as
Rt |At−1 , Yt ∼ BIN(At−1 + Yt , αt )

(7)

= At−1 + Yt − Rt

At

(8)

where BIN(n, α) denotes a binomial distribution with n trials and success probability α and Yt is a non
negative process with expectation λt = Ċt . Clearly, the bivariate process {At , Rt } defined by (8-7) is not

105

stationary. However, since Yt ≥ 0 and Ċt → 0 as t → ∞, we have Yt → 0 in distribution as t → ∞, and
if the removal probability αt does not approach zero as t → ∞, then At → 0 as t → ∞.

2.3

Peak of detected cases

The epidemic peak is an important event in the disease dynamic and can be estimated for a better
management of the epidemic. For an epidemic described by the exponential growth model (3) (K → ∞ or

110

νρ → 0) does not peak. Otherwise, the peak in the detected number of infected individuals corresponds
to the maximum of the incidence rate Ċt . This maximum is then attained when C̈t =

2.4

Overall epidemic dynamics

An important interest in modeling the epidemic incidence is the derivation of quantities related to the
overall dynamics of the epidemic, in both detected and undetected cases.
2.4.1

Total cases: detected and losts

120

Let us denote St the cumulative number of cases from the epidemic outbreak to t, and let Ṡt be the first
derivative of St . We also introduce Λt , the cumulative number of lost cases (with first derivative Λ̇t ), i.e.
people who were infected, undetected, and removed from infectives (mortality and recovery).
The size of the lost cases is determined by the unit time removal rate πt ∈ (0, 1) from undetected infectives
(πt is an average over all infectives, i.e. irrespective of the time since infection onset). The lost rate

125

πt which is assumed at least twice differentiable with respect to t, depends on various factors like the
disease related mortality, the average infection duration, the natural proportion of asymptomatics within
infectives, and the existence and the use of medicines that may reduce symptoms (induced asymptomatics).
It is worthwhile noticing that πt can be estimated from the removal rate αt in the detected cases (see
section 2.2), taking into account various factors that may induce difference between the two rates. For

130

instance, since the undetected cases include asymptomatics, desease related mortality may be lower and
recovery rate higher in undetected as compared to detected cases. However, efficiency of the health
care system in treating identified and isolated cases can reduce mortality thereby reducing αt , but also
improve recovery thereby increasing αt .
With the above notations, the lost cases count Λt satisfies the differential equation,
Λ̇t = πt (1 − δt )It

135

(12)

whereas the cumulative number of cases St is given on setting υt = (1 − πt )(1 − δt ) by
St = Ct + Λt + υt It .

(13)

The factor υt represents at time t the proportion of infectives who will potentially continue to spread
the epidemic after adequate contacts (i.e. contacts sufficient for transmission) with susceptibles. In other
words, the number of undetected currently infectives is (1 − πt )(δt−1 − 1)Ċt . From (1), the infectives It

Let us assume a constant detection rate δt = δ closely related to detection effort but also to the average
duration from infection to recovery or death of non-isolated cases. Assuming in addition a constant lost
rate (πt = π), we have δ̇t = π̇t = υ̇t = 0, and the new cases Ṡt and its accumulation St as well as the lost
cases Λt simplify to

numerical routines such as the R function uniroot or the Matlab function fzero. Afterwards, the peak Ṡp

2.5

Statistical models and inference

Let us consider a record of new confirmed infected cases Y1 , Y2 , · · · , Yn , active cases A0 , A1 , · · · , An−1 ,
removed cases R1 , R2 , · · · , Rn (available from (8) as Rt = Yt − At + At−1 ) and the associated vectors of
covariates X1 , X2 , · · · , Xn at n time points. The parameters K, ω, ν, ρ0 , τ , and κ can be estimated using

175

maximum likelihood (ML) by assigning to each Yt an appropriate statistical distribution with expectation
λt = Ċt and a dispersion parameter σ > 0, and probability density function (pdf) or probability mass
function (pmf) f (Yt |θ) where θ = (K, ω, ν, ρ0 , τ, κ, β >, σ)> . We subsequently consider inference under
log-normal and negative binomial distributions.
2.5.1

Log-normal model

180

Epidemic incidence case data are generally fitted through non linear least squares applied at logarithmic
scale (Chowell and Viboud, 2016, Chowell et al., 2007, Viboud et al., 2016). To deal with zero incidence

cases, the logarithmic transform is usually applied on the shifted cases Yt + 1. Mimicking this procedure
in a likelihood inference framework, we consider a log-normal distribution assumption for the shifted
incidence cases, i.e. Yt + 1 ∼ LN(λt + 1, σ). The pdf of Yt , adapted from Limpert et al. (2001), reads

so that Yt has expectation E[Yt ] = λt and variance V ar[Yt ] = (λt + 1) eσ − 1 .
2.5.2

Negative binomial model

Since incidence cases are counts, Yt can be assumed to follow the negative binomial distribution, i.e.
Yt ∼ NB(λt , σ) with pmf

The data

In order to test the reliability of the Turner’s growth model in predicting the dynamics of an epidemic,
we use data from one of the countries which has completed a whole COVID-19 outbreak wave. The daily
case reporting data in Italy has been obtained from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/
tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series. We use only the confirmed data

Data analysis

All analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 2019). We have fitted the Turner’s growth model curve

210

to the whole italian data. Both the log-normal and the negative binomial distributions were used and the
fit with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) computed for the daily new positive cases was selected
as the best. We next derived peak statistics (time and size) for daily new reported cases and actives
cases. We also inferred the daily new infections from assuming constant detection and lost rates and
estimated its peak (time and size). The detection (δ = 0.033/day) and the lost rates (π = 0.1/day) for

215

Italy were obtained from Pedersen and Meneghini (2020). These rates follows from assuming an average
time of duration from infection to recovery or death of non-isolated cases of ten days (hence π = 0.1/day)
and that during this detection window, 1/3 of infectives are tested positives (hence δ = 0.033/day).
In order to assess the ability of the model to predict the peak of the new positive cases in countries which
has not yet reached the peak, we retrospectively fitted the model to the italian data before the observed

220

peak (day 29 after the first case notification), using data of the first two weeks, and then data of the
first three weeks. For these analyses with limited data, we fitted the full Turner’s growth model to the
positives cases, but also its special cases, namely the hyper-Gompertz (ν → 0 while ων 1+ρ is constant),
the Gompertz (ν → 0, ρ → 0 while ων is constant), the Bertalanffy-Richards (ρ → 0), the hyper-logistic
(ν = 1) and the logistic (ν = 1 and ρ → 0) models using the log-normal distribution for the daily counts.

225

We then computed the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) defined as AIC = −2`b + 2Np with `b the
maximized log-likelihood and Np the number of parameters in a fitted model. We finally retained and
presented the best fit (lowest AIC value).

Table 1 shows parameter estimates using the whole italian COVID-19 daily case reporting data from
2020-02-20 to 2020-07-11, with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. It appears that the lognormal distribution based fit recorded the lowest RMSE and is thus retained for subsequent analyses.
The confidence bounds for the parameter ρ (ρ̂ = 0.32 with CI(ρ) = [0.29, 0.35]) indicate that neither

the logistic growth model (ρ → 0 and ν = 1) nor the Bertalanffy-Richards growth model (ρ → 0) are

From the estimate of the parameter β given in table 1 (βb = −4.02 with CI(β) = [−4.03, −4.01]), it
comes that the daily removal rate (recoveries and deaths) averaged α
b0 = 1.8% in the very early phase of
the epidemic (t ≈ 0 day). Then, from the estimate of κ (b
κ = 0.0076 with CI(κ) = [0.0075, 0.0076]), it
appears that the removal rate increased with time, i.e. the probability for an active case to recover or die
during a one day period increased on average by 5.5% over a week. Figure 1 (C) displays the actives
cases and the corresponding fitted curve using the removal probability along with the fitted equation
(30). The actives cases is predicted to peak on day 56 (b

Summary and perspectives

This work proposes the use of a flexible growth model for modeling case reporting data from an epidemic
outbreak with containment measures including at least isolation of individuals tested positive. The generic
growth model of Turner et al. (1976) offers a flexible framework with the possibility to recover many
special growth models such as the common exponential and the logistic growth models, the hyper-logistic,
the hyper-Gompertz, the Gompertz and the Bertalanffy-Richards growth models. Since the special
models are all nested within the generic model framework, the most appropriate model can be identified

using information criteria such as the Akaike’s An Information Criterion (AIC), but a likelihood ratio test
(Wilks, 1938) can also be conducted for models with different number of free parameters. When additional

290

information can be obtained on the ability to detect infective individuals (number of tests, tracing of
contact persons), the proposed framework allows to include this information so as to infer on the dynamics
of the epidemic beyond the identified (positive) cases, without ressorting to mechanistic/compartmental
models.
From our application to the COVID-19 outbreak data in Italy, the hyper-logistic model is the most

295

appropriate model for the dataset. It appears that the modeling approach can predict the dynamics of
an epidemic using data from first few days of an outbreak, at least in this example. Indeed, the predicted
peak time (and size) for the positives cases (using only the first two/three weeks data) overestimates (and
underestimates) the observed peak time (and size). However, the biases can be attributed for instance to
the increase in the testing effort and isolation (and the subsequent decrease in the growth rate) in Italy

300

where only about 3762 tests/day were performed in the first three weeks from 2020-02-20, and about
21248 tests/day were performed in the next three weeks. Our estimate of the ratio of the number of
infectives to the number of active cases averaged 22.95 in the first week of the outbreak, in the range
[5, 25] obtained by Pedersen and Meneghini (2020) using the SIQR model. Our proposal thus offers a
valid alternative to mechanistic models, for instance the picewise exponential growth used by Pedersen

305

and Meneghini (2020) withing the SIQR model framework on the italian early outbreak data.
In a very limited data situation, we suggest a further reduction of the number of model parameters
to be estimated. Indeed, since the parameter τ in the growth model (2) is a constant of integration
determined by the initial conditions of the epidemic, it can be expressed in terms of other parameters

τ = log ((K/C0 ) − 1) /(νω) for ρ = 0. Consideration of a procedure where τ is not estimated as a

positive at time t = 0. Inference on the effective reproduction number and the sensitivity of the epidemic
dynamics to containment measures under the generic growth model framework is considered for a future
work.
