Abstract
In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in
Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical
characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to normal controls in Chinese Han
population is limited. Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. In this case series of
752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present in 86-90% of the
patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%),
sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). the mortality rate is 4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9%
in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels of lymphocytes were
0.8（IQR, 0.6-1.1）109/L in Wuhan, 1.0（IQR, 0.7-1.4）109/L in Beijing, and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5)
109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively, indicating that cellular immune
function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference ranges of normal Chinese Han
population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is recommended that
reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below
900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300
cells/mm3.

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness, now known as SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, China.1-5 The disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to
other areas. As of February 11, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
(China CDC) has officially reported that there are 2.0% (889) asymptomatic cases, 2.3%
(1,023) death cases, and 80.9% mild cases among 44,672 confirmed cases. 51.4%
(22,981) were male and 48.6% (21,691) were female. 6

In January, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in samples of
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.1,2 Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that
SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses associated with human severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 1,2

COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to
have a wide spectrum of severity. Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 shared the same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2).7 Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity
than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors.7 Another report shows SARS-CoV-2 cell entry
depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2.8 Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells
and enterocytes of the small intestine are dominant, lung alveolar epithelial cells or
enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important susceptibility factor for human.9
According to World Health Organization interim guidance on January 12, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic case, mild and severe cases of
pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of
pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory
distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air.10 Asymptomatic case has been reported in China and
Germany.11,12 Huang et al3 first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in which most
patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Organ dysfunction

(shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney
injury, etc.) and death can occur in severe or critical cases. Guan et al4 reported findings from
1099 cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2
infection clustered within groups of humans in close contact, and was more likely to affect
older men with comorbidities. However, the full spectrum of disease without comorbidities or
related to cellular immune functions is not yet known. The objective of this case series was to
describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared to 14,117 normal
controls in Chinese Han population.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This retrospective study was done at Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking Union Medical
College Hospital, and affiliated hospitals of Shanghai University of Medicine & Health
Sciences. We extracted 752 case data in Shanghai (338 cases), and Beijing (414 cases) with
clinical confirmed COVID-19 from China CDC. 752 case data were enrolled to be finally
analyzed. Main symptoms and laboratory characteristics were from 178 patients surveyed by
random sampling. This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Shanghai
University of Medicine & Health Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Hospital
(#ZS-1830). 14,117 normal controls from health checkup (from November 2018 to
November 2019, before COVID-19 outbreak) in Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking
Union Medical College Hospital, and affiliated hospitals of Shanghai University of Medicine
& Health Sciences were retrospectively enrolled. Identification of patients was achieved by
reviewing and analyzing available electronic medical records and patient care resources.
Written informed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.
We retrospectively analyzed patients according to WHO interim guidance.13 Laboratory
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed as previously described. 14
All patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to
World Health Organization interim guidance.13 According to World Health Organization
interim guidance on January 12, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic

cases, mild and severe cases of pneumonia, and critical cases of pneumonia (ARDS, sepsis,
septic shock). Severe case of pneumonia is defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30
breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or SpO2 < 90% on room air.10 Clinical outcomes
(discharges, mortality, and recovery, etc.) were monitored up to March 4, 2020, the final date
of follow-up.
Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-CoV-2
A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing
or real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal
swab specimens. Samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patients
suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection as described previously.14 In brief, the pharyngeal
swabs were placed into a collection tube with 150 μL of virus preservation solution, and total
RNA was extracted within 2 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit. Forty μL
of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After
standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at 1000
rpm/min for 5 minutes. The suspension was used for RT-PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N),
were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. Target 1

signal at 55 °C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as
a positive test result, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These
diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral
Disease Control and Prevention (China). A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less
than 40, required confirmation by retesting. Only RT-PCR confirmed cases were included in
the analysis.
Flow Cytometry Data Analysis
All antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Two 100-μL
samples of blood were placed in two tubes for staining according to mmanufacturer’s manual.
After this procedure, 1 mL of red-cell lyses buffer was added to each tube and incubated for
10 minutes and then washed with Sorvall cell washer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). Cells were then resuspended in 350 μL of phosphate-buffered saline and acquired
with the use of FACSCanto™ flow cytometry; daily quality control and assurance were
carried out with the use of seven-color setup beads (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous
variables were described using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. Means
for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were
normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Data (non-normal
distribution) from repeated measures were compared using the generalized linear mixed
model. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test, although the
Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc).
For unadjusted comparisons, a 2-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and, given the
potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and descriptive.
Because the cohort of patients in our study was not derived from random selection, all
statistics are deemed to be descriptive only.

Results
Presenting Characteristics
The study population included 752 cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and
14,117 normal controls. Fever was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most
common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and
headache (9.8-11.1%) (Table 1). Less common symptoms were chill, sore throat, shortness of
breath, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

The COVID-19 mortality rate in China is 2.3%.6 However, the mortality rate is 4.6% (2,282
death cases in 49,540 confirmed cases）in Wuhan, 1.9% (8 death cases in 414 confirmed
cases) in Beijing, and 0.9% (3 death cases in 338 confirmed cases) in Shanghai based on
China CDC official report on March 4, 2020. Our findings showed that the levels of
lymphocytes were 0.8（IQR, 0.6-1.1）109/L in Wuhan,3 1.0（IQR, 0.7-1.4）109/L in Beijing,
and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals (Table 1), respectively,
indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality.

Radiologic and Laboratory Parameters in Mild and Severe or Critical Patients
The radiologic and laboratory findings were showed (Table 1). These data could helpfully
distinguish between mild and severe or critical patients. All of the 752 enrolled patients
showed bilateral patchy patterns, or ground-glass opacity, or local patchy shadowing of chest
CT scan. On admission, the predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral
patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass opacity (21.7%).

Due to lack of reference ranges for blood routine and lymphocytes of normal Chinese Han
population, we systematically analyzed the 14,117 healthy adult Chinese Han people of 18-86
years old and classified them as an age group every 10 years for the convenience of other
researchers in the future (Table 2).

The reference ranges of lymphocyte subsets are as followings (Table 2): CD3 + lymphocytes
(938-1835 cells/mm3), CD4+ lymphocytes (530-857 cells/mm3), CD8+ lymphocytes (348-621
cells/mm3), CD4/CD8 ratio (1.24-2.09), CD19+ lymphocytes (166-304 cells/mm3), and
CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes (180-304 cells/mm3). As the age increases，the levels of CD4
lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were decreased, whereas, the levels of
natural killer (NK) cells were elevated in Chinese Han population suggesting that the T and B
cell immune functions decline with age (Table 2).

The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases (ICU)
in 100% (Table 3). As the disease progressed and clinical status deteriorated, the levels of
lymphocytes progressively decreased before death. Further analyzing 178 cases without
glucocorticoid treatment, their lymphocyte subsets showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes
have significant difference (p < 0.01) between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU)
cases (Table 3).

The levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were elevated (Table 1),
indicating blood clot formation, severe inflammation, and cytokine storm in COVID-19
patients.

Discussion
This report, to our knowledge, is the first study of COVID-19 with normal controls. The
study population included 752 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 14,117 normal controls. Fever
was present in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough
(49.1-51.0%), fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%) (Table
1). Less common symptoms were chill, sore throat, shortness of breath, anorexia, diarrhea,
nausea, and vomiting. The levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were
elevated (Table 1), indicating blood clot formation, severe inflammation, and cytokine storm
in COVID-19 patients.

The reference ranges of lymphocyte subsets are as followings (Table 2): CD3 + lymphocytes
(938-1835 cells/mm3), CD4+ lymphocytes (530-857 cells/mm3), CD8+ lymphocytes (348-621
cells/mm3), CD4/CD8 ratio (1.24-2.09), CD19+ lymphocytes (166-304 cells/mm3), and
CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes (180-304 cells/mm3). As the age increases，the levels of CD4
lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were decreased, whereas, the levels of
natural killer (NK) cells were elevated in Chinese Han population suggesting that the T and B
cell immune functions decline with age (Table 2). Based on the reference ranges of normal
Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have observed, it is
recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19 infection are CD3 +
lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8+
lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3.

Secondary immunodeficiencies can result from various immunosuppressive agents
(immunosuppressive drugs or glucocorticoids). Many specific diseases directly or indirectly
cause secondary immunodeficiencies. This includes many types of cancer, and certain
chronic virus infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus). Our findings indicated
the PLD at presentation were associated with the severity of disease (Table 3). The severe
PLD or the secondary immunodeficiencies (CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm3) is
common in HIV patients. When CD4 lymphocytes are below 200 cells/mm3, patients with T
cell depletion have increased susceptibility to fungal infections.15,16

It has been reported that SARS-CoV directly infects monocytes, macrophages and T
lymphocytes in human.17 The PLD may also be secondary to activation of T lymphocytes.18
Our findings showed that CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes have significant difference (p < 0.01)
between mild (Non-ICU) and severe or critical (ICU) cases without glucocorticoid treatment
indicating COVID-19 directly effected on immune system is possible.

COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to
have a wide spectrum of severity as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold
higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the same receptors.7,19 The report shows

SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2.8 Therefore, it is necessary to
further study whether lymphocytes have ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 expression during the
developmental stage since the PLD exists. A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for lymphocyte
subsets in severe or critical cases should be followed up. Our findings also suggest that
lymphocyte subsets should be analyzed at admission immediately no matter how COVID-19
affected lymphocytes through directly or indirectly. When patients are confirmed as
COVID-19, clinicians should order tests for lymphocyte subsets in order to intervene early in
the consequences of the PLD.
Conclusions
In this case series of 752 patients, the full spectrum of cases is described. Fever was present
in 86-90% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (49.1-51.0%),
fatigue (25.2-27.1%), sputum (20.0-23.1%), and headache (9.8-11.1%). The mortality rate is
4.6% in Wuhan, 1.9% in Beijing, and 0.9% in Shanghai. Our findings showed that the levels
of lymphocytes were 0.8（IQR, 0.6-1.1）109/L in Wuhan, 1.0（IQR, 0.7-1.4）109/L in Beijing,
and 1.1 (IQR, 0.8-1.5) 109/L in Shanghai before admission to hospitals, respectively,
indicating that cellular immune function might relate to the mortality. Based on the reference
ranges of normal Chinese Han population and the data of the critically ill patients we have
observed, it is recommended that reference ranges of people at high risk of COVID-19
infection are CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500
cells/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3.
