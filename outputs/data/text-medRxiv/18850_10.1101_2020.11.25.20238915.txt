Abstract (word counts: 327)

55

Background: Acute and chronic alcohol abuse have adverse impacts on both the innate and

56

adaptive immune response, which may result in reduced resistance to severe acute respiratory

57

syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and promote the progression of coronavirus

58

disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there are no large population-based data evaluating potential

59

causal associations between alcohol consumption and COVID-19.

60

Method: We conducted a Mendelian randomization study using data from UK Biobank to explore

61

the association between alcohol consumption and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious clinical

62

outcomes in patients with COVID-19. A total of 12,937 participants aged 50-83 who tested for

63

SARS-CoV-2 between 16 March to 27 July 2020 (12.1% tested positive) were included in the

64

analysis. The exposure factor was alcohol consumption. Main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2

65

positivity and death in COVID-19 patients. We generated weighted and unweighted allele scores

66

using three genetic variants (rs1229984, rs1260326, and rs13107325) and applied the allele scores

67

as the instrumental variables to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on outcomes. Analyses

68

were conducted separately for white participates with and without obesity.

69

Results: Of the 12,937 participants, 4,496 were never or infrequent drinkers and 8,441 were

70

frequent drinkers. (including 1,156 light drinkers, 3,795 moderate drinkers, and 3,490 heavy

71

drinkers). Both logistic regression and Mendelian randomization analyses found no evidence that

72

alcohol consumption was associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants either with

73

(OR=0.963, 95%CI 0.800-1.159; q =1.000) or without obesity (OR=0.891, 95%CI 0.755-1.053; q

74

=.319). However, frequent drinking (HR=1.565, 95%CI 1.012-2.419; q =.079), especially heavy

75

drinking (HR=2.071, 95%CI 1.235-3.472; q =.054), was associated with higher risk of death in

76

patients with obesity and COVID-19, but not in patients without obesity. Notably, the risk of death

77

in frequent drinkers with obesity increased slightly with the average amount of alcohol consumed

78

weekly (HR=1.480, 95%CI 1.059-2.069; q =.099).

79

Conclusions: Our findings suggested alcohol consumption may had adverse effects on the

80

progression of COVID-19 in white participants with obesity, but was not associate with

Introduction

87

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

88

(SARS-CoV-2), is a highly contagious, fast-spreading, and life-threatening infectious disease[1]. So

89

far, it has spread to almost 200 countries and regions, infecting millions of people[2]. In its most

90

serious presentation, COVID-19 can progress rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome

91

(ARDS), multi-organ failure, and even death[3, 4]. Thus, identifying potential risk factors for

92

COVID-19 would be a substantial benefit to the public health.

93
94

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, off-premise sales of alcohol have increased, according to

95

Nielsen data[5, 6]. Acute and chronic alcohol abuse have adverse impacts on both the innate and the

96

adaptive immune response[7-10] and alcohol consumption is associated with increased

97

susceptibility to pneumonia[9, 11], tuberculosis[9], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection[9,

98

11], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)[9, 12]. Chronic alcohol abuse also exacerbates

99

severity of influenza A virus infection by inhibiting influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses[10].

100

SARS-COV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA)[13]. Recent data from both

101

murine models of ethanol exposure and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients

102

with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) indicate that signaling by viral ss/dsRNA is disrupted by

103

alcohol[14-16], analogous to impact of alcohol on signaling via bacterial products, such as

104

lipopolysaccharide[17]. Therefore, we hypothesized that alcohol consumption may result in reduced

105

resistance to SARS-COV-2 infection and promote the progression of COVID-19.

106
107

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, many misconceptions about the protective effects of

108

alcohol in preventing COVID-19 have appeared in social media[18, 19]. Although the World Health

109

Organization (WHO) and other public health authorities have stressed that alcohol consumption

110

does not destroy SARS-CoV-2 and may actually promote infection and accelerate disease

111

progression because of the immunosuppressive effects of alcohol[20], many people around the

112

world still believe that drinking alcohol helps prevent COVID-19[18, 19].

113
114

To date, there are no large population-based data evaluating the potential causal associations

115

between alcohol consumption and COVID-19. Therefore, in order to better understand the potential

116

impact of alcohol consumption on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the progression of

117

COVID-19, we applied the Mendelian randomization approach[21] to evaluate the causal

118

association among participants enrolled in a large national cohort, the UK Biobank, where detailed

119

information on COVID-19, alcohol consumption, other lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and

120

genotype data were rigorously collected.

121
122

Methods

123

This study is consistent with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in

124

Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline. The study did not have a pre-registered or published analysis

125

plan. UK Biobank has obtained Research Tissue Bank (RTB) approval from its ethics committee

126

and this study was also approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Cleveland Clinic (IRB

127

number:19582).

129

Study population from UK Biobank

130

The UK Biobank, a large population-based prospective cohort, recruited more than 500,000

131

participants aged 40-69 in 2006-2010 across the United Kingdom. A total of 13,502 participants

132

were tested for COVID-19 between March 16 and July 27, 2020. We excluded participants without

133

alcohol consumption data (n=67) and those without genotype data (n=515). Finally, 12937

134

participants were included in our study. Participants enrolled in UK Biobank have signed consent

137

Exposure of interest

138

The primary exposure of interest was alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption data on

139

participants enrolled by the UK Biobank obtained through a self-completed touchscreen

140

questionnaire at the time of enrollment. Participants were asked about their current drinking status

141

(never, previous, current). For current drinkers, they were then asked about the frequency of intake

142

and their average weekly and monthly consumption (the unit is a standard drink) of a range of

143

beverage types (fortified wine, spirits, beer plus cider, red wine, champagne plus white wine).

144
145

According to the NIAAA's classification criteria[22], we classified participants as heavy drinkers

146

(>7 drinks per week for women; >14 drinks per week for men), moderate drinkers (4-7 drinks per

147

week for women; 4-14 drinks per week for men), light drinkers (3 drinks or fewer per week), and

148

never or infrequent drinkers (special occasions only or 1-3 times a month). We also classified heavy

149

drinkers, moderate drinkers and light drinkers as frequent drinkers and those who never drank or

150

drank infrequently as non-drinkers.

151
152

Genetic data

153

UK Biobank released genetic sequence data from 488,377 individuals genotyped for 847,441

154

genetic variants in July 2017. Participants were genotyped on either the UK BiLEVE genotyping

155

array (n = 49,950; 807,411 markers) or the UKB Axiom Array (n = 438,427; 825,927 markers).

156

After filtering for genetic variants available on both genotyping arrays and sample quality control

157

processes [23], 488,377 participants with 805,426 single nucleotide variants were available in the

158

release. Detailed information about genotyping and imputation in the UK Biobank has been

159

described previously[23].

162

participants of UK Biobank identified 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with

163

alcohol consumption[24]. In addition, a study using data from UK Biobank and Genetic

164

Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging (GERA) datasets identified 6 SNPs (Alcohol

165

Dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B, rs1229984); Klotho Beta (KLB, rs13130794); Basic Transcription

166

Factor 3 Pseudogene 13 (BTF3P13, rs144198753); Glucokinase Regulator (GCKR, rs1260326);

167

Solute Carrier Family 39 Member 8 (SLC39A8, rs13107325); Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2,

168

rs11214609)) significantly associated with alcohol consumption[25].

169
170

The variant rs1229984 has been successfully used as an instrumental variable in the causal

171

estimation of alcohol consumption and assortative mating[26] and chronic widespread pain in the

172

participants of UK biobank[27]. However, the use of this single SNP may not adequately explain

173

genetic variance in alcohol consumption because of the low minor allele frequency (2.2%) of

174

rs1229984 in the UK Biobank[26]. In order to overcome the potential for weak instrument bias, we

175

generated an allele score utilizing three SNPs: rs1229984 (ADH1B), rs1260326 (GCKR), and

176

rs13107325 (SLC39A8), based on the results of the previous GWAS[25]. These three SNPs were

177

directly genotyped on both the UK BiLEVE and UKB Axiom Arrays and the missingness of these

178

SNPs in participants selected in this study less than 1%. Three additional SNPs (rs13130794 (KLB),

179

rs144198753 (BTF3P13), and rs11214609 (DRD2) were identified in a previous GWAS[25] and

180

were excluded here because they were not directly genotyped (805,426 markers) on the UK

181

Biobank arrays. Detailed information about the three selected SNPs included in this study is shown

182

in Table S1. The allele score was calculated per individual as the weighted or unweighted sum of

183

the number of fast alcohol metabolizing alleles of each SNP, whereas the effect of each SNP on

184

alcohol consumption provided in the GERA database (Table S1) was used as weight for the

185

calculation of weighted allele score [25, 28].

195

to the WHO classification[29]: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2),

196

overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (≥30 kg/m2).

201

cardiomyopathy, alcoholic psychosis, alcoholic myopathy, alcoholic polyneuropathy, and

217

record with ICD10 code U071 and other deceased COVID-19 positive patients without the

corresponding code.

219
220

Statistical analysis

221

All analyses were performed using Stata (Version 14.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Weekly

222

alcohol consumption was natural log-transformed to meet parametric assumptions. Categorical

223

variables were tested for association using Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test if more than 20%

224

of cells had expected frequencies < 5. For multiple comparisons correction, the false discovery rate

225

(FDR) was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method[30] and an adjusted P value (q-value)

226

< 0.1 and an unadjusted P value < 0.05 were considered significant.

227
228

Alcohol consumption was classified in three ways: (1) A four-level exposure categorical variable

229

including never or infrequent drinkers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers; (2) a

230

binary exposure variable comparing non-drinkers to frequent drinkers; and (3) a log-transformed

231

continuous variable of weekly self-reported alcohol consumption among frequent drinkers.

232
233

To reduce the potential confounding effects of factors other than alcohol intake on outcomes,

234

propensity score matching (PSM)[31] was applied to match non-drinkers and frequent drinkers

235

without replacement when we evaluated the associations between alcohol consumption and

236

outcomes. We included variables[32] previously reported to be associated with a higher risk of

237

COVID-19 as the matching factors for PSM. Factors including age, sex, BMI categories, current

238

smoking status, alcohol related diseases, asthma, emphysema, COPD, bronchitis/bronchiectasis,

239

esophagitis, gastritis/duodenitis, peptic ulcer, GERD, hypertensive, chronic ischemic heart disease,

240

heart failure, diabetes, dementia, renal failure, liver cirrhosis and/or liver failure, tumor and AIDS.

241
242

We applied two approaches to evaluate the relationship of alcohol consumption with outcomes:

243

logistic or Cox regression association analysis and Mendelian randomization analysis[21]. The

244

logistic regression was applied to evaluate the relationship between alcohol intake and the odds of

245

SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Cox regression analysis was applied to evaluate the relationship

246

between alcohol consumption and the risk of death in COVID-19 positive patients.

247
248

We used Mendelian randomization based on three assumptions: (1) the instrumental variable

249

(weighted or unweighted allele score) would not be associated with potentially confounding factors

250

of the risk of COVID-19; (2) the instrumental variable was significantly associated with exposure

251

factor-alcohol consumption; (3) the instrumental variable was only associated with the outcomes

252

through the exposure of interest. We evaluated these three assumptions using linear or logistic

253

regression.

254
255

For the Mendelian randomization analysis, the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) method[21] was

256

used to calculate the causal effect of alcohol consumption on the outcomes, using the weighted or

257

unweighted allele score as the instrumental variables. The 2SRI method requires adjustment due to

258

different classification methods and variable types (binary or continuous variable) of alcohol

259

consumption and outcomes. For the association of alcohol intake with the risk of SARS-CoV-2

260

infection, the adjusted 2SRI method was conducted. In the first stage, alcohol intake was associated

261

with the instrumental variable using a logistic regression model (binary exposure of non-drinkers

262

and frequent drinkers) or a linear regression (continuous variable of weekly alcohol consumption in

263

frequent drinkers). In the second stage, the outcome was fit using residuals from the first stage in a

264

logistic regression model. For the risk of death in COVID-19 positive patients, the residuals from

265

the first stage were included as covariates in a Cox regression model. Since the 2SRI method was

266

not suitable for evaluating the association between the four-level categorical variable of alcohol

267

consumption and outcomes, we only applied the logistic or Cox regression analysis for these

268

associations. In addition, we found obesity and race were associated with both the selected SNPs

269

and the risk of COVID-19 (all q-value<.10). These analyses were conducted separately for

participants with and without obesity, and in those of self-reported white ethnicity.

271
272

Sensitivity analysis

273

We performed two sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of specific subgroup of participants

274

and different definitions of outcomes, respectively, on our analysis. First, in order to clarify the

275

relationship between alcohol intake and outcomes in overweight, but not obese, patients, we

276

selected overweight participants for the sensitivity analysis. Second, because some COVID-19

277

positive patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) before they died or recovered and

278

there was no data on life support for patients other than those in ICU, we considered ICU admission

279

and death as serious clinical events and applied logistic regression and Mendelian randomization

280

analyses to evaluate the association between alcohol intake and the risk of severe clinical outcomes.

A total of 12,937 participants who had been tested for COVID-19 (from March 16 to July 27, 2020)

286

were selected for our analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these participants,

287

1,570 (12.1%) tested positive for COVID-19 and 11,367 (87.9%) tested negative. Regarding the

288

drinking status of these participants, 4,486 (34.8%) were never or infrequently drinkers, 1156 (8.9%)

289

were light drinkers, 3,795 (29.3%) were moderate drinkers, and 3,490 (27.0%) were heavy drinkers.

As shown in Table S3, significant differences were observed in age, sex, race, blood type, current

291

smoking, and comorbidities other than dementia, tumor, and AIDS between the non-drinkers and

292

frequent drinkers (all q <.10). Frequent drinkers tended to have a higher proportion of participants

293

who were older than 65 years (72.0% vs. 69.3%), white (96.6% vs. 86.1%), and of normal weight

294

(28.6 % vs. 24.2%) compared to non-drinkers. In contrast to the known deleterious health effects of

295

heavy drinking [7-10], frequent drinkers had a lower rate of comorbidities than non-drinkers (all q

296

<.10). Since the participants in the UK Biobank are between the ages of 50 and 83, we hypothesized

297

that there may be survivor bias between exposure factor (alcohol consumption) and multiple

298

complications. Therefore, to reduce the potential for survivor bias and the effects of confounding

299

factors on outcomes, all analyses were performed in the PSM cohorts and the 2SRI method applied

300

to calculate the causal effect of alcohol consumption on the outcomes [33].

301
302

Instrumental variable associations

303

Characteristics of participants by rs1229984, rs1260326, and rs13107325 genotypes are shown in

304

Table S4. Since the number of participants with alleles rs1229984 and rs13107325, associated with

305

rapid ethanol metabolism, was relatively small, we combined participants with one or two rapid

306

metabolism alleles for comparison. Participants with one or two rapid metabolism alleles compared

307

with those with two reference alleles tended to have a higher proportion of white participants and

308

patients with obesity (all q <.10). No significant differences in age, sex, blood types, current

309

smoking, or comorbidities were observed (all q <.10).

310
311

White Participants with one or two rapid metabolism alleles were less likely to be heavy-drinkers

312

and on average drank less alcohol if they were frequent drinkers (Table 1 and Figure S1). These

313

associations are consistent, but the difference between those with 2 or 3 more alleles is greater than

314

those between 0 and 1 (Figure 1). Associations of rs1229984, rs1260326, rs13107325 genotypes,

315

and the weighted or unweighted allele score with alcohol consumption were similar and significant

316

(all P <.05). The weighted allele score (F-test=26.289) was more strongly related to alcohol

317

consumption compared with other single SNPs and the unweighted allele score. Furthermore, we

318

did not find an association between SNPs or allele scores and the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

319

the risk of severe clinical outcomes or death in patients with COVID-19 (Table S5).

324

non-drinkers and matched frequent drinkers from the obese cohort and 2,305 non-drinkers and

325

matched frequent drinkers from the non-obese cohort were selected for evaluating the associations

326

between alcohol consumption and the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, 187 non-drinkers

327

and matched frequent drinkers from the obese cohort and 295 non-drinkers and matched frequent

328

drinkers from the non-obese cohort were selected for evaluating the association between alcohol

329

consumption and the risk of worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The association of alcohol

330

consumption with the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1) and the risk of death in COVID-19

331

positive patients (Figure 2) are shown.

332
333

Alcohol and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection

334

For the primary outcome, both logistic regression and Mendelian randomization analyses suggested

335

that alcohol consumption within all three classifications of drinkers --the four-level categorical

336

variable, the binary variable (non-drinkers and frequent drinkers), and the continuous variable of

337

weekly alcohol intake in frequent drinkers was not associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2

338

infection (All q >.10, Figure 1). No association was detected in white participants either with or

339

without obesity. In addition, there was no association between average weekly alcohol consumption

340

and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in either obese (OR=1.065, 95%CI 0.916-1.238; P=.412) and

341

non-obese (OR=0.955, 95%CI 0.864-1.057; P=.375) cohort before PSM from Mendelian

randomization analysis using the weighted allele score.

351

weekly were more likely to die compared with those drinking none or infrequently. In addition, we

352

found higher alcohol consumption in frequent drinkers resulted in higher risk of death when

353

analyzed by either Cox regression (HR=1.460, 95%CI 1.047-2.034; q =.058) or Mendelian

354

randomization analyses using the unweighted allele score (HR=1.457, 95%CI 1.045-2.032; =.078)

355

or the weighted allele score (HR=1.480, 95%CI 1.059-2.069; q =.099). However, these associations

356

did not exist in non-obese patients with COVID-19 (q >.10, Figure 2B). Consistent results

357

regarding the relationship between average weekly alcohol intake and the risk of death was found in

358

both obese (HR=1.418, 95%CI 1.051-1.914; P=.022) and non-obese (HR=0.952, 95%CI

359

0.755-1.201; P=.680) cohorts before PSM from Mendelian randomization analysis using weighted

360

allele score. As shown in Figure 3, Kaplan–Meier survival plots illustrated that heavy drinkers with

361

obesity had a higher mortality than non-drinkers (Log rank P value=.027), which was not observed

362

in non-obese patients with COVID-19 (Log rank P value=.471).

Sensitivity analysis

365

Association between alcohol consumption and outcomes in overweight but not obese patients

366

A total of 4,869 overweight white participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The test positivity rate

367

was 11.7% and the mortality rate of overweight patients with COVID-19 was 18.1% (103/568).

368

Consistent with previous results for patients without obesity (Figure 1-2), alcohol consumption was

369

not associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or death in overweight COVID-19 positive

370

patients (q >.10, Table S6).

371
372

Risk of severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients

373

ICU admission and death in COVID-19 positive patients were grouped together as having severe

374

clinical outcomes. Because some of the patients were admitted to ICU before they were diagnosed

375

with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, we couldn’t use the Cox regression model to analyze the

376

association between alcohol consumption and severe clinical outcomes in the COVID-19 positive

377

cohort without time-to-event data. Heavy drinkers with obesity had a higher likelihood of admission

to ICU and death compared to non-drinkers (OR=2.432, 95%CI 1.345-4.397; q =.027, Figure 4A).

379

Both logistic regression (OR=1.766, 95%CI 1.114-2.801; q =.072) and Mendelian randomization

380

analyses using unweighted allele score (OR=1.762, 95%CI 1.11-2.794; q =.048) or weighted allele

381

score (OR=1.710, 95%CI 1.077-2.715; q =.052) identified that COVID-19 positive patients with

382

obesity who reported consuming alcohol weekly were more likely to suffer severe clinical outcomes

383

compared with those drinking none or infrequently. In addition, we found that the likelihood of

384

serious clinical outcomes in frequent drinkers with obesity slightly increased with the average

385

amount of alcohol consumed weekly based on the result of Mendelian randomization analysis using

386

unweighted allele score (OR=1.020, 95%CI 1.003-1.038, q =.095) and weighted allele score

387

(OR=1.018, 95%CI 1.001-1.036; q =.054, Figure 4A). However, these associations did not exist in

388

non-obese patients with COVID-19 (q >.10, Figure 4B).

Discussion

391
392

Using the UK Biobank cohort, we investigated whether alcohol consumption increased

393

susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among 12,937 white participants who have been tested for

394

SARS-COV-2, as well as whether there were worse outcomes among 1,570 patients with

395

COVID-19 using regression analyses and Mendelian randomization analysis. We found that alcohol

396

consumption did not increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, frequent drinking,

397

especially heavy drinking, was associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with

398

obesity, but not non-obese patients. Notably, the risk of worse clinical outcomes in frequent drinkers

399

with obesity increased slightly with the average amount of alcohol consumed weekly.

patients with obesity, but not non-obese, patients, suggesting the potential interactions between

405

alcohol consumption and obesity to cause rapid progression of COVID-19. Consistent with a

406

previous report[34], our study found that patients with obesity were more susceptible to

407

SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR=1.260, 95%CI 1.092-1.453; P=.002) and had a higher risk of death

408

(HR=1.561, 95%CI=1.122-2.171; P=.008) from COVID-19. The high expression of

409

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) in adipocytes of patients with obesity may

410

promote the entry of SARS CoV2 into host cells and turn adipose tissue into a potential target and

411

reservoir of SARS CoV2[35]. Moreover, adipose tissue, a major source of pro-inflammatory

412

chemokines, cytokines, and adipokines, plays an important role in mediating inflammatory

413

responses. Patients with obesity have higher concentrations of circulating tumor necrosis

414

factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP); this low grade chronic

415

inflammatory state may be involved in initiating cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19[34].

416
417

Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of ARDS[12], which is a common

418

manifestation of severe COVID-19. This is likely due to the dysregulation of both immune and

419

non-immune host defense mechanisms in the airways, resulting in alveolar epithelial barrier

420

dysfunction and alveolar macrophage immune dysregulation in response to heavy alcohol

421

consumption[9, 12]. However, the mechanisms for the potential interaction between alcohol and

422

obesity in the progression of COVID-19 are not well understood. Previous work has found that

423

chronic ethanol exposure in murine models impacts adipose tissue, phenocopying obesity in many

424

aspects. Chronic ethanol feeding decreases glucose uptake by adipose tissue, increases immune cell

425

infiltration and expression of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines[36]. Data from pre-clinical

426

models also demonstrates that binge drinking and obesity synergistically induces steatohepatitis and

427

fibrosis in the liver of mice via the induction of hepatic chemokines, inflammatory cytokines and

428

neutrophil infiltration[37, 38]. Taken together, alcohol intake and obesity may affect the progression

429

of COVID-19 via impact on adipose tissue and inflammatory responses; the additive and/or

430

synergistic effects of obesity and alcohol may lead to a significant deterioration of COVID-19

431

patients. However, mechanisms for the potential interactions between alcohol and obesity in the

432

progression of COVID-19 are not well understood.

433
434

Strengths and Limitations

435

One of main advantages of this study is the application of Mendelian randomization to evaluate the

436

causal relationships between alcohol consumption and the risk of SARS CoV2 infection and the

437

severity of COVID-19 outcomes. To our knowledge, the associations between alcohol and risk of

438

COVID-19 have not been previously explored using Mendelian randomization. We generated

439

weighted and unweighted allele scores using three SNPs rs1229984 (ADH1B), rs1260326 (GCKR),

440

and rs13107325 (SLC39A8) and applied the weighted and unweighted allele scores as the

441

instrumental variables to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on outcomes. These three SNPs

442

were randomly distributed among the white participants and were not associated with other

443

confounders that may affect outcomes. However, rs1229984, rs1260326, and rs13107325 were

444

significantly correlated with obesity. This issue was well addressed by our separate analysis based

445

on whether the white participants were obese or not. In addition, the Mendelian randomization

446

approach more robustly handles measurement error and reverse causality compared to traditional

447

observational approaches. Another major advantage of our study is the detailed data in a larger

448

population-based prospective cohort including genotype data, alcohol consumption, and potential

449

confounding risk factors. Almost all the confounding factors that have been reported to be

450

associated with the risk of COVID-19 are available in the UK Biobank. Therefore, we were able to

451

balance these factors in non-drinkers and frequent drinkers using PSM to better assess the specific

452

effect of alcohol consumption on the risk of COVID-19 in the traditional observational study and

453

Mendelian randomization study.

454
455

This study also has several limitations. First, since the majority of participants in the study were

456

British and Irish descents (93%) and only 195 non-white participants were infected with SARS

457

CoV2, we could not investigate the impact of alcohol consumption on the risk of worse outcomes in

458

non-white participants with COVID-19 using Mendelian randomization analysis. However,
17

459

according to the results of the Chi-square test, we found heavy drinkers had a higher mortality than

460

non-heavy drinkers (57.1% vs. 18.0%, P=.038) in the non-white group with obesity, which was not

461

observed in non-obese group (20.0% vs. 8.0%, P=0.220). Second, we are unable to assess the effect

462

of changes in the alcohol consumption since subjects (n=501,608) were enrolled in the UK Biobank

463

in 2006-2010. Although the self-reported alcohol consumption data of some participants were

464

updated in 2012 (n=20,336), 2014 (n=48,340) and 2019 (n=3,081), the number of these patients

465

with COVID-19 was relatively small and the corresponding statistical analysis could not be

466

performed. Only 5 COVID-19 positive patients had their alcohol consumption data updated in 2019

467

and there was no significant change in their drinking patterns (data not shown). Finally, due to the

468

limitations of the data in the UK Biobank, we could not assess the impact of alcohol consumption

469

on the symptoms and some severe clinical outcomes (requirement of oxygen therapy, glucocorticoid

470

therapy, and administration of invasive ventilation) of patients. To minimize this limitation, we

471

classified ICU admission and death as the severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients

472

and found heavy drinkers had a higher risk of admission to ICU and death in patients with obesity

473

compared to non-drinkers.

474
475

Conclusions

476

Despite the limitations, our study was the first to find that alcohol consumption, especially heavy

477

drinking, is associated with a higher risk of suffering worse COVID-19 clinical outcomes in patients

478

with obesity through both traditional regression analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses. In

479

addition, alcohol consumption was not associated with either increased or decreased risk of SARS

480

CoV2 infection. Our findings could help people understand the relationship between alcohol

481

consumption and COVID-19, especially those who may drink excessively in the mistaken belief

482

that alcohol consumption reduces the risk of SARS CoV2 infection[18, 19]. Moreover, due to the

483

possible interactions between alcohol consumption and obesity in the progression of COVID-19,

484

physicians may need to adjust and develop appropriate management and treatment strategies for

485

COVID-19 positive patients who consume alcohol and are obese.
