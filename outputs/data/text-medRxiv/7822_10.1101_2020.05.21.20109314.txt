Summary

of the infections. Governments have resorted to impose social
distancing measures to reduce this number well below 1.0.
The estimation of R0 hinges on the forecasting model and
the data used to infer their parameters. Moreover, an often
overlooked fact is that, the method by which inference is performed also plays a role on these estimates. A well established
technique for such inference is Bayesian inference [5]. However, even though Bayesian inference is a very potent method
to estimate uncertainties in model structure and parameters,
model parameters may be unidentifiable for the chosen type
and amount of data as well as the choice of priors [6, 7].
In this work we deploy Bayesian inference to quantify the
evolution of R0 as well as the time points of interventions for
51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple, and well established SIR model [8], extended to account for interventions, with data from reported
daily infections. We present an online interface that allows for
entry of customized data and comparisons between countries.
The parameters of the model include the reproduction number, the day of the first intervention and a reduction factor
for the reproduction number. By inferring these parameters
from data, we identify when interventions become effective
and determine the reproduction number before and after the
measures have become effective. This indicates how well the
imposed restrictions are able to slow down the spread of the
disease.
We remark that very recently a related work [9] inferred
the intervention points and the evolution of R0 in Germany.
We note that in the present work we apply our model to
51 European countries. Our model is able to fit the data
for the majority of the countries without individual tuning
of the parameters or the inference method for each country.
We note that our results are in excellent agreement with the
work previously mentioned [9] for Germany. Moreover our
results indicate that capturing accurately the results for one
country does not generalize well with the same accuracy to
all countries. We visualize the inferred quantities on a map
and rank the countries by the disease’s spread rate and the
effectiveness of the interventions. We find that the results
of our model are consistent with those from related studies
in Switzerland [10]. The results suggest that at the current
stage of the pandemic, countries can be categorized according
to the inferred R0 . Most countries have imposed their restric-

The reproduction number (R0 ) is broadly considered as
a key indicator for the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimation of its value with respect to the key
threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually
effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven
inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as
well as the time points of interventions for 51 European
countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of
the simple and well established SIR model with data from
reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the
data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference
framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present
a publicly available GUI cse-lab.ethz.ch/coronavirus that
allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease’s spread
suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can
lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic.

Introduction

The forecasting of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the effects of lock-downs of any kind as well as social distancing measures are critical components for decision makers
across the world. There is a broad range of data analysis
tools and forecasting models that have been deployed since
the beginning of 2020 to assess the spread of the disease as
well as the expected number of infections and numbers of
deaths [1, 2, 3]. A metric that is often deployed to quantify
the progress of the disease is the reproduction number (R0 ).
While R0 exhibits significant complexity [4], it is broadly considered that values of R0 above 1.0 indicate a rapid expansion

tions within the first weeks of the epidemics starting March
2020, and since then about 80% of them have managed to
bring their country specific R0 below 1 which indicates a
decaying epidemic. Other countries, such as Poland, Sweden
and Moldova, remain at a stage with larger R0 .

We quantify the uncertainty in the extended SIR model as
described above using data of daily reported infected people
of each country. We denote this data with Iˆi corresponding to
day ti . From the SIR model, the daily incidence is computed
as

f (ϑ, ti ) =
S(τ )I(τ ) dτ = S(ti−1 ) − S(ti ) , (3)

Data

where ϑ = (R0? , γ, kint , tint , δint ) are the model parameters of
the SIR model including an intervention as described above.
The initial number of infected individuals is set from the available data so that I0 = Iˆ0 . We consider the following generative model for the daily incidence data

Iˆi ∼ N B f (ϑ, t), g(ϑ, t) ,
(4)

We calibrate the well established SIR model using data from
daily confirmed cases reported in the open source repository
Humanistic GIS Lab, University of Washington [11], whose
main data source for European countries is the World Health
Organization [12]. To avoid the stochastic regime of the system, for each country we consider data only after the number
of confirmed cases exceeds a total of five and a total of two
per million of population. Population figures for countries are
retrieved from the open repository [13]. The analysis in this
paper considers data up to May 18, 2020. Official times of
interventions that we use for comparison in Section 3.2 are
taken from [14] which aggregates the official announcements
of social distancing measures by various governments.

where N B is the negative Binomial parametrized by the mean
f (ϑ, t) and the dispersion g(ϑ, t). Notice that using this
parametrization, the variance of an observation Iˆi is given
by f (ϑ, ti ) + f (ϑ, ti )2 /g(ϑ, ti ). Here, the dispersion function is constant, i.e. g(ϑ, t) = r, where the parameter vector has been extended to include the dispersion parameter r,
ϑ = (R0? , γ, kint , tint , δint , r).
We denote the collection of observations by the vector
Iˆ = (Iˆ1 , . . . , IˆN ) and the corresponding observation times by
t = (t1 , . . . , tN ). For the estimation of the probability of ϑ
conditioned on the data, we apply Bayes’ theorem,

are summarized in Table 1. We assume that the removal

following [15].
The inference of ϑ is performed using Korali [16, 17], a
high-performance framework for uncertainty quantification
and optimization of computational models. The posterior
distribution was estimated with Bayesian Annealed Sequential Importance Sampling (BASIS), a reduced variant of the
Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) algorithm [18], ran with 5000 samples and default parameters
taken from [19].

The three phases are: (i) uncontrolled disease outbreak before the first intervention takes place (t ≤ tint − 12 δint ), (ii) an
adoption phase during which one or multiple measures take
place (tint − 21 δint ≤ t ≤ tint + 12 δint ), and (iii) the period after
all interventions have become effective (t ≥ tint + 12 δint ). In the
first and last regime we assume that the reproduction number
R0 (t) remains constant, and during the adoption phase we assume a linear transition from R0? to kint R0? . The intervention
time tint and the reduction factor kint ∈ (0, 1) are inferred
from the data, while the duration of transition remains fixed
at δint = 10 days.

data in the input form. The accuracy of the Bayesian inference can be improved by increasing the number of samples used by the solver. User requests are forwarded from
the web server to a remote workstation where the runs are
executed. The back-end code of our model evaluation is implemented in the Python, while performance critical parts
are implemented in C++. The mean and confidence interval

Social distancing measures introduced by the Swiss government starting on March 17, 2020 have been more successful in
stopping the epidemic, compared to the less strict approach of
Sweden. The samples drawn from the posterior distribution

Results and Discussion
Verification

We verify the presented intervention model using the results
of a recent related study [9] that reported the results of a
similar SIR model with interventions. They also performed
Bayesian inference of the model parameters applied to Germany. That model has more parameters to describe multiple
interventions and considers a periodic modulation of the daily
reported cases to account for trends such as under-reporting
on the weekends. We compare our results to this study in
Fig. 4 where the reported quantities are the effective growth
rate λ∗ (t) = γ(R0 (t) − 1), the number of new daily cases and
the total number of cases. The effective growth rate relates
to one limiting case of the SIR model where the total number
of infected individuals is small compared to the population
such that S/N → 1 and the model reduces to an exponential
growth I(t) ∝ exp(λ∗ t), which is valid at early stages of the
epidemic. Fig. 5 shows the corresponding parameters drawn
from the posterior distribution.
We want to highlight that our model is simpler and has
fewer parameters than the one suggested in [9]. Also we observe that the fitted model agrees well with the reported data
and provides an estimate for the intervention time for Germany.

Application to 51 European countries

assistance with the Korali framework. We acknowledge funding by ETH Zürich and computing resources by the Swiss
Supercomputing center (CSCS).

We apply our framework to 51 countries of the European
continent and infer the model parameters for each country
separately. The inferred reproduction number before and after intervention is shown in Fig. 2. The map and the scatter
plot reveal the differences in the values of R0 and effects of interventions among various countries. Certain countries show
strong similarity in the inferred parameters. For example, the
neighboring Switzerland and Austria both have R0 dropping
from 2.3 to 0.7 after interventions, even though the latter
imposed more constraining measures. The same is evident
for other pairs such as Italy and France and also Poland and
Ukraine. However, no single explanation for these similarities and differences can be suggested. Physical proximity of
the countries does not always lead to similar progression of
the epidemic. One example is Poland where the epidemic
has started slower but the imposed restrictions have proved
less efficient than in adjacent Lithuania. The disease’s development depends on the types of measures taken by the
governments as well as the demographics and the particular
features of the social interactions in the population. For instance, the UK and Sweden initially decided against imposing
strict measures and therefore undergo a longer epidemic with
more infections than their neighbors, Ireland and Norway,
which corresponds to larger inferred values of R0 .
Another inferred parameter is the intervention time. Figure 3 shows the relation between the reproduction number
and the intervention time measured from the beginning of
the epidemic in each country. One trend is apparent from
the values of R0 before intervention: countries with larger
initial R0 tend to introduce the restrictions earlier.
The inferred intervention times are shown in Fig. 6 and
listed in Table 2 together with the times when the restrictions
have been officially announced. The countries are ordered by
the inferred intervention time which helps to identify countries with similar inferred parameters. For certain countries,
such as Switzerland, Germany and Greece, the inferred intervention time matches the official announcements with a
delay of at most one week. In other cases, the delays can
reach up to one month. This may indicate that the measures
are imposed gradually and do not show an immediate effect.
The present code and GUI are open source and can be
adapted to various countries and data. We believe that
the present study indicates the power and need for data
driven Bayesian inference in the forecasting of the evolution
of COVID-19. We note that the described methodology is
readily extensible to other epidemic models and types of data
that are the subject of our ongoing studies.
