Abstract

34

By the third week of June 2020, more than 8,500,000 positive cases of COVID-19 and

35

more than 450,000 deaths had been officially reported worldwide. The COVID-19

36

pandemic arrived in Latin America, India, and Africa—territories in which the mounted

37

infrastructure for diagnosis is greatly underdeveloped. Here, we demonstrate the combined

38

use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubation chamber for commercial Eppendorf

39

PCR tubes, and a colorimetric embodiment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification

40

(LAMP) reaction scheme for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used this

41

strategy to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences using a set of in-house

42

designed initiators that target regions encoding the N protein. We were able to detect and

43

amplify SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of 62 to 2 × 105 DNA copies by this

44

straightforward method. Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 samples and a limited number of

45

RNA extracts from patients, we also demonstrate that colorimetric LAMP is a quantitative

46

method comparable in diagnostic performance to RT-qPCR. We envision that LAMP may

47

greatly enhance the capabilities for COVID-19 testing in situations where RT-qPCR is not

48

feasible or is unavailable. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of this

49

strategy make it a reliable alternative for deployment of point-of-care SARS-CoV-2

50

detection efforts during the pandemics.

Introduction

56

By the end of the third week of June 2020, more than 8.5 million positive cases of COVID-

57

19 were officially reported across the globe[1]. Even developed countries, such as the USA,

58

England, France, and Germany, are still struggling to mitigate the propagation of SARS-

59

CoV-2 by implementing social distancing and widespread testing. Less developed regions,

60

such as Latin America, India, and Africa, are now experiencing the arrival of COVID-19,

61

but these—territories are woefully lacking in the finances or the mounted infrastructure for

62

diagnosis of this pandemic infection. Rapid and massive testing of thousands of possibly

63

infected subjects has been an important component of the strategy of the countries that are

64

effectively mitigating the spreading of COVID-19 among their populations (i.e., China[2],

65

South Korea [3], and Singapore [4]). By comparison, developing countries with high

66

demographic densities, such as México [5], India [6], or Brazil [7], may not be able to

67

implement a sufficient number of centralized laboratories for rapid large-scale testing for

68

COVID-19.

69

Many methodologies have been proposed recently to deliver cost-effective diagnosis (i.e.,

70

those based on immunoassays [8–11] or specific gene hybridization assisted by CRISPR-

71

Cas systems [12–14]). While immunoassays are an accurate and efficacious tool for

72

assessing the extent of the infection for epidemiological studies [15], their usefulness is

73

limited to the identification of infected subjects during early phases of infection [11,16], a

74

critical period for infectiveness. For instance, experimental evidence collected from a small

75

number of COVID-19 patients (9 subjects) showed that 100% of them produced specific

76

immunoglobulins G (IgGs) for SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of infection, but only 50%

77

of them did during the first week post infection [17].

78

Nucleic acid amplification continues to be the gold standard for the detection of viral

79

diseases in the early stages [18–22], and very small viral loads present in symptomatic or

80

asymptomatic patients can be reliably detected using amplification based technics, such as

81

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [23–25], recombinase polymerase amplification

82

(RPA)[26], and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [27–29].

83

During the last two pandemic events with influenza A/H1N1/2009 and COVID-19, the

84

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization

85

(WHO) recommended real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) methods as the gold standard

86

for official detection of positive cases[16,30]. However, the reliance on RT-qPCR often

87

leads to dependence on centralized laboratory facilities for testing [16,30–33]. To resolve

88

this drawback, isothermal amplification reaction schemes (i.e., LAMP and RPA) have been

89

proposed as alternatives to PCR-based methods and devices for point-of-care settings

90

[32,34,35]. The urgency of using reliable molecular-based point of care (POC) methods for

91

massive diagnostic during epidemiological emergencies has become even more evident

92

during the current COVID-19 pandemics [30,36,37].

93

In these times of COVID-19 [38], scientists and philanthropists around the globe have

94

worked expeditiously on the development of rapid and portable diagnostics for SARS-

95

CoV-2. Several reports have demonstrated the use of colorimetric LAMP-based methods

96

for diagnosis of pandemic COVID-19 [39–44]. Some of these reports (currently available

97

as preprints) use phenol red, a well-known pH indicator, to assist in the visual

98

discrimination between positive and negative samples [39,40,45].

99

In this study, we demonstrate the use of a simple embodiment of a colorimetric LAMP

100

protocol for the detection and amplification of synthetic samples and actual RNA samples

101

from patients of SARS-CoV-2, the causal viral agent of COVID-D. In this LAMP-based

102

strategy, also assisted by the use of phenol red, sample incubation is greatly facilitated by

103

the use of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed incubator connected to a conventional water

104

circulator, while discrimination between positive and negative samples is achieved by

105

visual inspection. We quantitatively analyze differences in color between positive and

106

negative samples using color decomposition and analysis in the color CIELab space[46].

107

Moreover, we compare the sensibility of this LAMP colorimetric method versus PCR

108

protocols. This simple strategy is potentially adequate for the fast deployment of diagnostic

109

efforts in the context of COVID-19 pandemics.

110
111

Rationale

112

We have developed a simple diagnostic method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the

113

causal agent of COVID-19. The rationale underlying this strategy is centered on achieving

114

the simplest possible integration of easily available reagents, materials, and fabrication

115

techniques to facilitate fast and massive implementation during the current COVID-19

116

pandemics in low- or middle-income regions. This method is based on the amplification of

117

the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 using LAMP. The amplification is conducted using a

118

commercial reaction mix in commercial and widely available 200 µL Eppendorf PCR

119

tubes. Moreover, we have designed and fabricated a simple 3D-printed chamber (Figure 1)

120

for incubation of the Eppendorf tubes and to enable LAMP at high temperatures (50–65 ºC)

121

and extended times (up to 1 h). We show that this incubation chamber, when connected to a

122

conventional water recirculator, enables the successful amplification of positive samples

123

(i.e., samples containing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids).

124

This incubation chamber is one of the key elements that enable rapid and widespread

125

implementation of this diagnostic method at low cost. This 3D-printed incubator can be

126

rapidly printed using standard SLA printers widely available in markets worldwide.

Standard 3D-printing resins can be used. The availability of the original AutoCAD files

design for accommodation of a larger number of samples or larger or smaller tubes,

139

Indeed, all this is consistent with the main rationale of our proposed diagnostic strategy for

140

pandemic COVID-19: To enabling a fast and feasible response using widespread,

141

distributed, and scalable diagnostics fabricated with widely available resources.

142

In the following section, we briefly discuss the mechanisms of amplification and visual

143

discrimination between positive and negative samples.

144
145

Colorimetric LAMP amplification

146

The presence of phenol red within the LAMP reaction mix allows for naked-eye

147

discrimination between positive and negative samples (Figure 2). The reaction mix is

148

coupled with the pH color transition of phenol red, a widely used pH indicator, which shifts

149

in color from red to yellow at pH 6.8. During LAMP amplification, the pH of the reaction

150

mix continuously evolves from neutrality to acidic values as protons are produced [27,47].

151

The mechanism of production of hydrogen ions (H+) during amplification in weakly

152

buffered solutions has been described [47]. DNA polymerases incorporate a

153

deoxynucleoside triphosphate into the nascent DNA chain. During this chemical event, a

154

pyrophosphate moiety and a hydrogen ion are released as byproducts (Figure 2A). This

155

release of hydrogen ions is quantitative, according to the reaction scheme illustrated in

156

Figure 2. The caudal of H+ is high, since it is quantitatively proportional to the number of

157

newly integrated dNTPs. In fact, the quantitative production of H+ is the basis of previously

158

reported detection methods, such as the semiconductor sequencing technology operating in

159

Ion Torrent sequencers[48]. In the initially neutral and weakly buffered reaction mixes, the

160

production of H+ during LAMP amplification progressively and rapidly shifts the pH across

161

the threshold of phenol red (Figure 2B).

Both sets of primers performed equivalently, at least based on visual inspection, in the three

temperature conditions tested. Discrimination between positive and negative controls is

183

possible using only the naked eye to discern the reaction products from amplifications

184

conducted at 60 and 65 ºC. No or negligible amplification was evident at 50 ºC or in the

185

186

Furthermore, we were able to successfully discriminate between positive and negative

187

samples using LAMP reaction mix already added with primers and kept at 20 °C or 4 °C

188

for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h (Figure S5). The stability of the reaction, the isothermal nature of

189

the amplification process, and its independence from specialized equipment greatly

190

simplifies the logistic of implementation of this diagnostic method outside centralized labs.

191
192

Analysis of sensitivity

193

We conducted a series of experiments to assess the sensitivity of the LAMP reactions in the

194

3D-printed incubation chamber using the two sets of primers (α and β; Table 1). The

195

amplification proceeds with sufficient quality to also allow proper visualization of the

196

amplification products in electrophoresis gels, even at low nucleic acid concentrations. We

197

observed that amplification proceeded successfully in a wide range of viral loads, from 625

198

to 5 × 105 copies in experiments using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid material (Figure

199

3A). We clearly observed amplification in samples containing as few as 625 viral copies

200

after incubation times of 50 min at 65 ºC. If we put this range into a proper clinical context,

201

the actual viral load of COVID-19 in nasal swabs from patients has been estimated to fall

202

within the range of 105 to 106 viral copies per mL [49]. Discrimination between positive

203

and negative samples (controls) can be clearly established by the naked eye in all reactions

204

incubated for 50 min, regardless of the number of viral copies present. In addition, we did

205

not observe any non-specific amplification in negative samples (i.e., containing synthetic

206

genetic material form EBOV) incubated for 50 min at 65 ºC. Indeed, the identification and

207

amplification of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic material is feasible in samples that contained ~62.5

208

viral copies using this LAMP strategy (Figure S3) and incubation times of 50–60 min.

products of each one of the LAMP experiments, where two different sets of primers (α and

226

227

synthetic viral copies). We were able to generate a visible array of bands of amplification

228

products, a typical signature of LAMP, for both LAMP primer sets and across the whole

229

range of synthetic viral loads. Indeed, both primer sets rendered similar amplification

230

profiles.

231

In summary, using the primers and methods described here, we were able to consistently

232

detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic nucleic acids. We have used a simple 3D-

233

printed incubator, connected to a water circulator, to conduct LAMP. We show that, after

234

only 30 min of incubation, samples containing a viral load in the range of 10 4 to 105 copies

235

could be clearly discriminated from negative samples by visual inspection with the naked

236

eye (Figure 2C). Samples with a lower viral load were clearly discriminated when the

237

LAMP reaction was incubated for 50 min. Incubation periods of up to 1 h at 68 ºC did not

238

induced false positives and were able to amplify as few as ~62 copies of SARS-CoV-2

239

synthetic genetic material. These results are consistent with those of other reports in which

240

colorimetric LAMP, assisted by phenol red, has been used to amplify SARS-COV-2

241

genetic material [39,40]. We observe 0 false positive cases in experiments where synthetic

242

samples containing EBOV genetic material were incubated at 65 ºC for 1 h.

243

In the current context of the COVID-19 pandemics, the importance of communicating this

244

result does not reside in its novelty but in its practicality. Some cost considerations follow.

245

While the market value of a traditional RT-qPCR apparatus (the current gold standard for

246

COVID-19 diagnostics) is in the range of 10,000 to 40,000 USD, a 3D-printed incubator,

247

such as the one described here (Figure S1,S2; Supplementary file S1), could be fabricated

248

for under 200 USD at any 3D printer shop. This difference is significant, especially during

249

an epidemic or pandemic crisis when rational investment of resources is critical. While the

250

quantitative capabilities of testing using an RT-qPCR platform are undisputable, the

251

capacity of many countries to rapidly, effectively, and massively establish diagnostic

252

centers based on RT-qPCR is questionable. The current pandemic scenarios experienced in

253

the USA, Italy, France, and Spain, among others, have crudely demonstrated that

254

centralized labs are not an ideal solution during emergencies. Portable diagnostic systems

255

may provide a vital flexibility and speed of response that RT-qPCR platforms cannot

256

deliver.

257
258

Feasibility of real-time quantification

259

Here, we further illustrate the deterministic and quantitative dependence between the

260

concentration of the amplification product and the color signal produced during this

261

colorimetric LAMP reaction. For this purpose, we simulated real-time amplification

262

experiments by conducting a series of amplification reactions using initial amounts of 625,

263

1 × 104, and 2 × 105 copies of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in our 3D-printed

264

incubator.

265

We extracted samples from the incubator after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min of incubation at

266

65 ºC. The color of these samples was documented as images captured using a smart phone

267

(iPhone 7) against a white background (Figure 4A). The images were analyzed using the

268

free access application Color Companion® for the iPhone or iPad. Briefly, color images

269

were decomposed into their CIELab space components. In the CIELab color space, each

270

color can be represented as a point in a 3D-space, defined by the values L, a, and b [46]. In

271

this coordinate system, L is the luminosity (which ranges from 0 to +100), a is the blue-

272

yellow axis (which ranges from -50 to 50), and b is the green-red axis (which ranges from -

273

50 to 50) (Figure S4).

The difference between two colors can be quantitatively represented as the distance

286

between the two points that those colors represent in the CIELab coordinate system. For the

287

colorimetric LAMP reaction mixture used in our experiments, the spectrum of possible

288

colors evolves from red (for negative controls and negative samples) to yellow (for positive

289

samples). Conveniently, the full range of colors for samples and controls can be represented

290

in the red and yellow quadrant defined by L [0,100], a [0,50], and b [0,50]. For instance, the

291

difference between the color of a sample (at any time of the reaction) and the color of the

292

negative control (red; L=53.72 ± 0.581, a=38.86 ± 2.916, and b=11.86 ± 0.961) can be

293

calculated in the CIELab space. We determined the distance in the CIELab space between

294

the color of samples taken at different incubation times that contained SARS-CoV-2

295

genetic material and negative controls (Figure 4B, C). We repeated this calculation for each

296

of the LAMP primer sets that we used, namely primer set α (Figure 4B) and β (Figure 4C).

297

These results suggest that the color difference between the samples and negative controls is

298

quantifiable. Therefore, color analysis may be implemented to assist the discrimination

299

between positives and negatives. Furthermore, imaging and color analysis techniques may

300

be implemented in this simple colorimetric LAMP diagnostic strategy to render a real-time

301

quantitative Lamp (RT-qLAMP).

302

Alternatively, the progression of the amplification at different times can be monitored by

303

adding an intercalating DNA agent (i.e., EvaGreen Dye), and measuring fluorescence on

304

time (Figure S5).

305

Note that the variance coefficients for the control are 1.08, 7.50, and 8.10% for L, a, and b,

306

respectively. These small values suggest robustness and reproducibility in the location of

307

the coordinates of the control point (reference point). Similarly, the variation in color

308

between negative controls and positive samples incubated for 50 min was reproducible and

309

robust (average of 46.60 +/- 4.02 d.u.; variance coefficient of 8.62%).

320

Interestingly, we observed significant differences in the performance of the two LAMP

321

primer sets used in the experiments reported here (Figures 4B and 5).

322

Our results suggest that primer set α enabled faster amplification in samples with fewer

323

viral copies. Consistently, this primer set yielded positive discrimination in samples with

324

625 viral copies in 30 min (Figure 4B). The use of primer set β enabled similar differences

325

in color, measured as distances in the CIELab 3D-space, in 40 min (Figure 4C).

326

These findings suggest that primer set α should be preferred for final-point implementations

327

of this colorimetric LAMP method. Interestingly, primer set β may better serve the purpose

328

of a real-time implementation. While primer set α produced similar trajectories of evolution

329

of color in samples that contained 1.0 × 104 and 2.0 × 105 viral copies (Figure 5A), primer

330

set β was better at discriminating between amplifications produced from different initial

331

viral loads (Figure 5B).

332
333

Comparison of LAMP versus PCR

334

LAMP has been regarded before as a more efficient amplification reaction than PCR, since

335

more DNA is produced per unit of time due to the use of a higher number of primers[50]

336

(in this case 6 versus 2). To finalize our analysis, we simulated some real-time

337

amplification experiments to compare the performance of LAMP and PCR in similar

338

conditions (Figure 6A). To that end, we conducted amplification reactions using initial

339

amounts of 4 × 104 copies of synthetic SARS-CoV2 in a commercial miniPCR

340

cycler[24,51] (using primer set N1) and in our LAMP 3D-printed incubator (using primer

341

set β). We added the intercalating agent, EvaGreen® Dye, to the reaction mix at the initial

342

time and extracted samples after 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 51 minutes. These samples

343

form PCR and LAMP experiments were dispensed in 96-weel plates. The fluorescence

344

from these samples was then measured in a commercial plate reader[24] (Figure 5C). We

345

observed an exponential increase in fluorescence as more LAMP or PCR cycles were

346

performed, which highlights the quantitative nature of the intercalating reaction. The

347

LAMP reaction produces significantly higher fluorescence signals that the PCR reaction

348

throughout the entire reaction time. The difference between the fluorescence emissions of

349

both amplifications is more evident after the first 20 minutes of amplification. These

350

results also suggest that using a commercial plate reader to determine the extent of advance

351

of LAMP amplifications is a practical and reliable alternative to the use of colorimetric

352

evaluations. Moreover, fluorescence reading of LAMP products may lead to precise

353

quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads.

354

We also compared the performance of RT-qPCR and colorimetric LAMP using actual RNA

355

extracts isolated from human volunteers. For this purpose, first we used colorimetric

356

LAMP for diagnosis of one RNA sample confirmed as positive for COVID-19 and one

357

confirmed as negative according to RT-qPCR results. RNA extracts from the COVID-19

358

(+) patient were clearly discriminated from the COVID-19 (-) patient extracts by our

359

colorimetric LAMP amplifications (Figure 6A).

360

Similar results were obtained regardless of the LAMP primer set used (i.e., α and β). We

361

corroborated our LAMP amplification results using standard gel electrophoresis (Figure

362

6B). In addition, samples were serially diluted to challenge the sensitivity of colorimetric

363

LAMP. We were able to discriminate between positive and negative samples in the entire

364

concentration range tested (300 ng of total RNA, as determined by nanoDrop assays). The

365

color shift (red to yellow) was clearly perceived after 30 minutes of amplification in

366

samples containing 300 ng of total RNA from COVID (+) patients. Samples containing 30

367

and 3 ng of total RNA required longer times (Figure 6C).

A suggested positive–negative threshold value is indicated with a red line.

387
388

Positive samples exhibited a shift in color after 60 minutes of amplification, while negative

389

samples remained unchanged. We quantified the change in color in positive and negative

390

samples using color image analysis and by calculating color distances in the CieLab color

391

space (Figure 6D,E).

392

Our experiments show that the distance in color between positive and negative RNA

393

samples from human volunteers is proportional to the number of viral copies. These results

394

suggest that the change in color can be quantitatively related to the viral load of SARS-

395

CoV-2 in actual RNA extracts, similarly to synthetic samples.

396

In a final set of experiments, we blind tested a set of 8 extracts of human RNA from

397

nasopharyngeal samples corresponding to 2 patients that were diagnosed as COVID-19 (-)

398

and 6 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 (+) by RT-qPCR. We adjust the RNA content in all

399

samples to 300 ng/µL of RNA and then diluted them to derive samples containing 30

400

ng/µL. All samples, undiluted and diluted, were added with the LAMP reactive mix and

401

incubated at 65 ° C by 50 minutes. All samples exhibit a red color before incubation

402

(Figure 7A), and only positive samples shifted to yellow during incubation (Figure 7B). We

403

confirmed results by gel electrophoresis of the amplification products. Only positive

404

samples exhibited the characteristic DNA profile associated with LAMP products (Figure

405

7C,D). Colorimetric LAMP was also able to discriminate positive samples correctly even in

diluted extracts containing one order of magnitude less RNA than original extracts.

Concluding remarks

433

The challenge of point-of-care detection of viral threats is of paramount importance,

434

particularly in underdeveloped regions and in emergency situations (i.e., epidemic

435

outbreaks). In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of testing

436

infrastructure based on RT-qPCR is recognized as a serious challenge around the world. In

437

developing economies (i.e. Latin America, India, and most African countries), the currently

438

available resources for massive COVID-19 testing by RT-qPCR will clearly be insufficient.

439

Even in developed countries, the time to get diagnostic RT-qPCR results from a COVID-19

440

RT-qPCR test currently ranges from 1 to 5 days.

442

Clearly, the available PCR labs are overburdened with samples, have too few personnel to

443

conduct the tests, are struggling with backlogs on the instrumentation, and face complicated

444

logistics to transport delicate and infective samples while preserving the cold chain.

445

Here, we have demonstrated that a simple embodiment of a LAMP reaction, assisted by the

446

use of phenol red as a pH indicator and the use of a simple 3D-printed chamber connected

447

to a water circulator can enable the rapid and highly accurate identification of samples that

448

contain artificial SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences. We also showed, using synthetic SARS-

449

CoV-2 and a limited number of RNA extracts from patients, that colorimetric LAMP is a

450

quantitative method, comparable to RT-qPCR. Amplification is visually evident, without

451

the need for any additional instrumentation, even at low viral copy numbers. In our

452

experiments with synthetic samples, we observed 100% accuracy in samples containing as

453

few as 625 copies of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material.

454

Validation of these results using a larger number of real human samples from positive and

455

negative COVID-19 subjects is obviously needed to obtain a full assessment of the

456

potential of this strategy as an alternative to RT-qPCR platforms. However, our results with

457

synthetic samples and with a reduced number of samples containing RNA from human

458

volunteers (8 samples) suggest that this simple strategy may greatly enhance the

459

capabilities for COVID-19 testing in situations where RT-qPCR is not feasible or is

460

unavailable. Recently, other groups have shown that accurate discrimination between

461

COVID-19 positive and negative samples is positive in extraction-free RT-qPCR[52] and

462

colorimetric LAMP implementations[45]. Smyrlaki et al. extensively investigated the

463

performance of an extraction-free RT-qPCR protocol in which saliva or nasopharyngeal

464

samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 minutes for virus inactivation and then directly

465

amplified. Lalli et al. showed successful amplification using a similar colorimetric LAMP

466

protocol in which they heated saliva samples at 50 or 64 °C for 5 minutes optionally adding

467

protease K. These results suggest that extraction-free implementations of amplification

468

methods, including colorimetric LAMP, can successfully identify COVID-19 positive

469

patients from nasopharyngeal and saliva samples. Altogether, this body of evidence

470

suggests that extraction-free colorimetric LAMP provides means for cost-effective massive

471

diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 and is a promising tool for pandemic contention that deserves

472

further exploration.

Materials and Methods

475

Equipment specifications: We ran several hundred amplification experiments using a

476

colorimetric LAMP method in a 3D-printed incubation chamber designed in house and

477

connected to a conventional water circulator (Figure 1). The design and all dimensional

478

specifications of this chamber have been made available in Supplementary Information

479

(Figures S1, S2; Supplementary File S1). In the experiments reported here, we used a

480

chamber with dimensions of 20 × 5 × 15 cm3 and a weight of 0.4 kg (without water). A

481

conventional water circulator (WVR, PA, USA), was used to circulate hot water (set point

482

value at 76 ºC) through the 3D-printed chamber for incubation of the Eppendorf PCR tubes

483

(0.2 mL). In this first chamber prototype, twelve amplification reactions can be run in

484

parallel. This concept design is amenable for fabrication in any STL-3D printing platform

485

and may be scaled up to accommodate a larger number of tubes.

486

We used a blueGel electrophoresis unit, powered by 120 AC volts, to validate the LAMP

487

amplification using gel electrophoresis. Photo-documentation was done using a

488

smartphone camera. We also used a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek Instruments,

VT, USA) to detect the fluorescence induced by an intercalating reagent in positive

490

samples from the PCR reactions.

491

Validation DNA templates: We used plasmids containing the complete N gene from 2019-

492

nCoV, SARS, and MERS as positive controls, with a concentration of 200,000 copies/µL

493

(Integrated DNA Technologies, IA, USA). Samples containing different concentrations of

494

synthetic nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were prepared by successive dilutions from stocks

495

(from 2 × 105 copies to 65 copies). We used a plasmid that contained the gene GP from

496

EBOV as a negative control. The production of this EBOV genetic material has been

497

documented elsewhere by our group [23].

498

RNA extracts from human volunteers. In addition, we used 8 samples of RNA extracts from

499

6 COVID-19 positive and 2 negative subjects, as determined by RT-PCR analysis. Samples

500

were kindly donated by Hospital Alfa, Medical Center, in Guadalupe, Nuevo León,

501

México. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from two patients after obtaining

502

informed and signed written consent and in complete observance of good clinical practices,

503

the principles stated in the Helsinki Declaration, and applicable lab operating procedures at

504

Hospital Alfa. Every precaution was taken to protect the privacy of sample donors and the

505

confidentiality of their personal information. The experimental protocol was approved on

506

May 20th, 2020 by a named institutional committee (Alfa Medical Center, Research

507

Comitte; resolution AMCCI-TECCOVID-001). RNA extraction and purification was

508

conducted at the molecular biology laboratory at Hospital Alfa. The Qiagen QIAamp DSP

509

Viral RNA Mini kit was used for RNA extraction and purification by closely following the

510

directions of the manufacturer.

Each set, containing six LAMP primers, were used to target two different regions of the

526

sequence of the SARS-Co2 N gene. In addition, for comparison purposes, we conducted

527

PCR amplification experiments using one of the primer sets recommended by the CDC for

528

the standard diagnostics of COVID-19 (i.e., N1 assay) using RT-qPCR. The sequences of

529

our LAMP primers are presented in Table 1. The sequences of the PCR primers (N1) have

530

been reported elsewhere[24,53].

531
532

Amplification protocols: For all LAMP experiments, we performed isothermal heating for

533

30 or 60 min. In our experiments, we tested three different temperatures: 50, 60, and 65 ºC.

For PCR experiments, we used a three-sta e protocol consistin o a denaturation sta e at
4

or 5 min, ollo ed y 25 cycles o

4 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s,

536

and then a final stage at 72 °C for 5 min, for a total duration of 60 min in the miniPCR®

537

thermocycler from Amplyus (MA, USA).

539

Documentation of LAMP products: We analyzed 10 μL o each LAMP reaction in a

540

blueGel unit, a portable electrophoresis unit sold by MiniPCR from Amplyus (MA, USA).

541

This is a compact electrophoresis unit (23 × 10 × 7 cm3) that weighs 350 g. In these

542

experiments,

543

tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE). We used the Quick-Load Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder

544

(NEB, MA, USA) as a molecular weight marker. Gels were dyed with Gel-Green from

545

Biotium (CA, USA) using a 1:10,000 dilution, and a current of 48 V was supplied by the

546

blueGel built-in power supply (AC 100–240V, 50–60Hz).

547

As an alternative method for detection and reading of the amplification product, we

548

evaluated the amplification products by detecting the fluorescence emitted by a DNA-

549

intercalating agent, the EvaGreen® Dye from Biotium (CA, USA), in a Synergy HT

550

microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, VT, USA). Brie ly, 25 μL o the LAMP reaction

551

was placed in separate wells of a 96-well plate following completion of the LAMP

552

incu ation. A 125 μL volume o nuclease-free water was added to each well for a final

553

sample volume o 150 μL and the samples

554

experiments were run in triplicate. The following conditions were used in the microplate

555

reader: excitation of 485/20, emission of 528/20, gain of 75. Fluorescence readings were

556

done from the top at room temperature.

Color determination by image analysis: We also photographically documented and

559

analyzed the progression of color changes in the positive and negative SARS-CoV-2

560

synthetic samples during the LAMP reaction time (i.e., from 0 to 50 min). For that purpose,

561

Eppendorf PCR tubes containing LAMP samples were photographed using a smartphone

562

(iPhone, from Apple, USA). We used an application for IOS (Color Companion, freely

563

available at Apple store) to determine the components of color of each LAMP sample in the

564

CIELab color space. Color differences between the positive samples and negative controls

565

were calculated as distances in the CIELab coordinate system according to the following

566

formula:

567
568

Color Distancesample-negative= SQRT [(Lsample-Lnegative)2 + (asample-anegative)2 + (bsample-bnegative)2]

569
570

Here L, a, and b are the color components of the sample or the negative control in the

571

CIELab color space (Figure S4).
