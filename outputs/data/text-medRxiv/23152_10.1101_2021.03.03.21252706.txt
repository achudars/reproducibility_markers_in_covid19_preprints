The variant of concern (VOC) P.1 emerged in the Amazonas state
(Brazil) in November-2020. It contains a constellation of mutations,
ten of them in the spike protein. Consequences of these specific mutations at the population level have been little studied so far, despite
the detection of P.1 variant in 26 countries, with local transmission
in at least four other countries in the Americas and Europe. Here, we
estimate P.1’s transmissibility and reinfection using a model-based
approach, by fitting data from the Brazilian national health surveillance of hospitalized individuals and frequency of the P.1 variant in
Manaus from December 2020 to February 2021, when the city was
devastated by four times more cases than in the previous peak (April
2020). The new variant was found to be about 2.6 times more transmissible (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.4–2.8) than previous circulating variant(s). The city already had a high prevalence of individuals previously affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (estimated as 78%,
CI:73–83%), and the fitted model attributed 28% of the cases during
the period to reinfections by the variant P.1. Our estimates rank P.1
as the most transmissible among the current identified SARS-CoV2 VOCs, posing a serious threat and requiring urgent measures to
control its global spread.

T

he Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases identified the new P.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant from travelers
returning from Amazonas State, Brazil, on 6-January-2021
(1). P.1 was eventually reported in Manaus city (Amazonas
state capital), on 11-January-2021 (2). Later, it was identified in samples collected since 6-Dec-2020 from Manaus (3).
According to phylogenetic studies, P.1 likely emerged in the
Amazonas state in early (3) or late (4) November 2020. This
variant shares mutations with other variants of concern (VOCs)
previously detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa
(B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively) (2). Mutations of these
two other variants are associated with greater transmissibility
and immune evasion (5, 6), which confer them the status of
variant of concern. However information, data, and analyzes
on the epidemiology of P.1 are still incipient.
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in
Manaus (April–May 2020) was followed by a period of high
but stable incidence, after which prevalence may have reached
42% (7) to 76% (8) by November 2020. From December 2020
to February 2021 the city was devastated by a new outbreak
that caused a collapse in the already fragile health system
(9), with shortages of oxygen supply (10), while the frequency
of P.1 increased sharply from 0% in November 2020 to 73%

in January 2021 (4). The pathogenicity of P.1 variant is still
unknown, although recent studies point to increased viral load
in individuals infected with the new variant (4), suggesting
it could be higher than the one from previous circulating
strain. We analyzed Brazilian national health surveillance
data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and the frequency of P.1
among sequences from residents of Manaus city using a modelbased approach (an extended SEIR compartmental model –
see Fig. 1) to estimate the transmissibility and relative force
of reinfection of the P.1 variant.
Results. The estimated transmissibility of P.1 was 2.6 (95%

Confidence Interval (CI): 2.4—2.8) times higher compared to
the wild-type variant, while the relative force of reinfection
of the new variant was estimated to be 0.032 (CI: 0.026—
0.040, Table 1) The fitted model also estimated that, at the
RMC, FMDM, LSF, MEB, RLPS, TPP, SP, CF, RAK, MASMV, and PIP designed research; RMC,
FMDM, LSF, MEB, RLPS, TPP, SP, and PIP performed research and analyzed data; and all authors

time P.1 variant emerged, the prevalence of previous infection
by the wild-type variant was 78% (CI: 73–83%), and that
the number of cases by the wild-type variant were increasing
with an estimated daily intrinsic growth rate of 0.029 days−1
(CI: 0.024—0.035 days−1 ). Given these parameter values,
reinfections by P.1 accounted for 28% of the cases in Manaus
from November 2020 through January 2021.
We also evaluated the impact of a distinct pathogenicity
of the P.1 variant on our estimates by allowing the infection
hospitalization rate (IHR) of the new variant to be estimated
as a free parameter (see SA1 in Table 1). The relative transmissibility and prevalence did not differ statistically from the
the previous estimates. However, the data gives no support
for a higher IHR of P.1. Moreover, the model fit to hospitalization data prior to the healthcare system collapse in the
city of Manaus (11 January, 2021) estimated an even larger
transmissibility (SA2 in Table 1).

P.1, estimated to be 2.6 times more transmissible than the
wild-type variant. The spread of P.1 occurred despite a high
estimated prevalence of infection by the wild-type virus. The
pathogenicity of P.1 is still unknown, but assuming hospitalization rates as a proxy for pathogenicity, P.1 transmissibility
holds for different ranges of pathogenicity. Two recent studies
analysed genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 from Manaus evaluating the transmissibility of the new variant (3, 4). Faria and
collaborators integrated mortality and genomic data and, using
a semi-mechanistic Bayesian model, estimated a transmissibility 1.4–2.2 times higher and 25–61% evasion of protective
immunity related to the variant P.1 (3). Naveca and collaborators estimated a 2.2 times higher effective reproduction
number for the P.1 variant using phylogenetic methods, and
suggested that P.1 is at least two times more transmissible than
the parental lineage, assuming reinfections are rare (4). The
present work follows a different approach that can be defined
as an epidemiological, model-based, and data-fitting approach,
suitable for scenarios where only surveillance data are available, and applicable to other emerging variants throughout
the world. Notably, all three different approaches estimated
very high transmissibility of the P.1 variant.

|

Many knowledge gaps about the pandemic in the Amazonian region still remain. Population-based serological surveys
are not available and thus prevalence was included in the fitted
parameters. The analysed data overlapped with the period
of the health system collapse. Aware that in-hospital fatality
rates can quickly change when the health system is under
stress (12), we have chosen hospitalization data instead of
mortality data (See Dataset). Still, during the health system
collapse many severe cases probably were not recorded in the
system and remained unaccounted for. Our results were robust
to removing this period in the sensitivity analysis (SA2). Even
without P.1 emergence, the model estimates an increase in the
number of cases (parameter r, see Table 1), which could be a
consequence of loosening non-pharmacological interventions
(NPIs) (9), an effect of waning immunity, or both. Our model
does not consider these effects explicitly, but by fitting the
initial growth rate we indirectly account for their effects on the
dynamics and on the estimation of the remaining parameters.
The impacts of a highly transmissible variant have already
been highlighted by the spread of VOC B.1.1.7 in the UK, USA
and Europe (13). The variant B.1.1.7 has an upper-bound
estimate for transmissibility of 2.3 (5), which is smaller than
our lower bound estimate for P.1. Higher transmissibility of
the P.1 variant raises strong concerns of swift upsurges in the
number of cases once P.1 reaches community transmission.
Although our estimate for the relative force of reinfection
by the variant P.1 seems low, the impact is strong enough
to drive, together with a high transmissibility, a large surge
even in a population heavily affected by the wild-type variant.
For instance, in Manaus, 28% of the new cases in the period
considered were due to reinfections by P.1 in our estimations,
reaching 40% when assuming a different IHR for P.1 (SA1).
However, in a scenario of low prevalence rate of infection by
the wild-type variant, the high transmissibility is the most
determinant parameter of the rapid increase in the number
of cases and can lead to even sharper outbreaks. The P.1
variant has already been detected in at least 26 countries, with
local transmission currently confirmed in four of them (13).
This points to the urgency of reinforcing measures to avoid a

global spread of P.1, which include an agile global genomic
surveillance network. Further, to improve our ability to deal
with the threat of P.1, it is urgent to study i) the pathogenicity
of the P.1 variant, since this trait, in association with high
transmissibility, can drive even well-prepared health systems
to collapse; ii) the efficacy of current vaccines for P.1 variant
infections; and iii) the main factors promoting the emergence
of VOCs, specially the roles of previous high prevalence and
of waning immunity.

Dataset. We used the Brazilian epidemiological syndrome surveillance system for influenza, SIVEP-Gripe (https://opendatasus.saude.
gov.br), to track COVID-19 hospitalized cases. All hospitalized

152

patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) are reported
to SIVEP-Gripe with symptom onset date and SARS-CoV-2 test
results. SIVEP-Gripe, due to its universal coverage and mandatory
notification of SARI cases, has an homogeneous testing effort to
diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and is currently the best source
for Brazilian data at the national level. Hospitalization data provides the most accurate basis to infer incidence in Manaus, because
mild cases are vastly under-reported and testing capacity fluctuates,
while mortality data is harder to relate to total number of cases,
since the city’s health system endured a prolonged stress even before
the collapse, with large variation in the in-hospital fatality rate over
time (12). Data for hospitalized COVID-19 cases among residents
in Manaus from 01-Nov-2020 to 31-Jan-2021 was obtained from
SIVEP-Gripe database of 15-Feb-2021. The hospitalized cases of the
last 10 weeks in the time series were nowcasted (14) to correct for
notification delay. Time-series of frequency of sequenced genomes
identified as P.1 in Manaus were extracted from published datasets
(3, 11).

Model. A deterministic compartmental model (Figure 1) was devel-

154

oped to model the infection of Susceptible individuals moving to the
Exposed (pre-symptomatic) compartment, which can progress to
three alternative compartments: Hospitalized (severely ill), Infected
(symptomatic but non-hospitalized), and Asymptomatic. Eventually, individuals move to Recovered or Deceased. Two variants are
considered: 1-non-P.1 (“wild-type”) and 2-new/P.1. The latter is
assumed to infect Recovered individuals previously infected by the
wild-type, and no reinfections of wild-type due to waning immunity occur. Compartments were stratified into three age categories:
young (< 20 years old), adult (≥ 20 and < 60 years old) and elderly
(≥ 60 years old), with different rates for outcomes. The key parameters of relative transmissibility and relative force of reinfection
– the ratio between the force of infection by P.1 on previously infected individuals (reinfections) and the force of infection by P.1 on
susceptible ones (new infections) – were estimated by a maximum
likelihood fitting to the weekly number of new hospitalizations and
to genomic surveillance data. Three additional model parameters
with unknown values were estimated. The remaining parameters
(24 out of 29) were fixed, using current values from the literature

(see Supplementary Information (SI) for values and references). Sensitivity to different pathogenicity of the variant P.1 was explored
by repeating the fit assuming IHR as a free parameter (SA1). The
sensitivity to the period analysed was also explored by another fit
excluding the health system collapse period (SA2). Further model

In order to estimate key parameters of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, we developed a model and fitted it to time-series
data of number of hospitalized cases and frequency of the P.1 variation. The fitting approach used here can be applied to other
regions where data is relatively scarce. It primarily requires weekly incidence data to determine proper model initial conditions.
In Brazil, these are the hospitalized cases data. Stratification by age allows the model to also consider the different death rates,
asymptomatic and hospitalized proportions of each age class, important features for SARS-CoV-2. Contact levels between
different age classes, which may vary from one place to another, can also be considered. For special cases in which information
such as contact between ages classes and age distribution are not available (or even unnecessary for some other disease), the
model can be easily simplified. In this sense, the method proposed here demands low-detailed data and relies on the structure
of a simple compartmental model to measure quantities of interest, such as transmissibility and relative force of reinfection.
Section 1 describes the model, section 2 relates the values of the parameters taken from the current literature, section 3
describes the contact matrix used, and finally section 4 describes the treatment of case data (subsec. A), the choice of initial
conditions (subsec. B), the fitting procedure (subsec. C), and the sensitivity analysis evaluated regarding pathogenicity and
data period analysed (subsec. D)

The model is an extended Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered (SEIR) model that comprises susceptible (S),
pre-symptomatic (E), asymptomatic (A), mild symptomatic (I), severe/hospitalized (H), recovered (R) and deceased (D)
compartments. These compartments are duplicated to account for a second variant of SARS-CoV-2, and each of them is
stratified into three age classes: young (<20 years old), adults ([20 − 59] years old), and the elderly (≥ 60 years old). The
“wild-type” classes represent all non-P.1 variants present, which do not seem to be variants of concern.
We assume that the second variant is capable of reinfecting individuals who have recovered from infection by the wild-type
variant while the inverse is not possible; in the absence of data indicating this possibility, allowing reinfection by the wild-type
variant on recovered of infection by P.1 would have negligible effect due to the small time window (3 months) considered in the
present work. We also consider that a variant is not capable of reinfecting individuals recovered from the same lineage. Our
model does not include vaccination due to low rates of vaccination in Brazil during the study time period.
To model the virus spread in the population, we assume that asymptomatic individuals have equal infectiousness compared
to symptomatic ones, while pre-symptomatic individuals have reduced infectiousness represented by ω. To model behaviour,
we assume that symptomatic individuals self-isolate themselves to some degree, reducing their contacts by ξ. Individuals with
severe disease have greater isolation ξsev due to hospitalization. The daily contacts between each age class is represented by
the matrix Ĉ. The force of infection λk for each variant k is defined below:
λk = βk Ĉ[Ak + ωEk + (1 − ξ)Ik + (1 − ξsev )Hk ]

The proportion is weighted by the age distribution of the population with each age category.

3. Contact Matrices
Our model includes three age group categories: young ([0 − 19] y.o.), adults ([20 − 59] y.o.), and elderly (greater than 60y.o.).
To model contacts between these groups we use estimated contact matrices computed by (8), but since the original matrices
use five-year age bins going up to 95+ years, we aggregate classes leading to a 3 × 3 matrix in the following way:
Let A, B be sets of indexes forming age groups (not necessarily of equal sizes), xi,j denoting contact between age groups i
and j in the original matrix, di denoting population size of the age group i. The new contact matrix Ĉ is given by:

XX
ĈA∗ ,B ∗ =

where A∗ , B ∗ denotes a new indexation rule. Note that the contact matrices depend on local demographics and therefore must
be computed for each place of study.

4. Data Analysis Procedures

62

A. Nowcasting. Data used in parameters estimation were collected from the national public health system of severe acute

71

respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance database, named Sistema de Vigilância da Gripe - SIVEP-Gripe. In this system,
reporting of cases can be delayed for several reasons, including the notification system itself and confirmation of RT-PCR test
results. The nowcasting procedure estimates, based on the past delay distribution, the number of cases that already occurred
but were not yet reported. A window of 10 weeks is the acting window on the series, since delays greater than this are rare.
Nowcasting requires a pair of dates: (i) onset date of the event and (ii) report date of the event. The delay distribution is
modeled as being best described as a Poisson distribution for days since the onset date to the report date. We considered the
first symptoms date as the onset date. For the report date, we used the latest between the test result date and the clinical
classification date. The nowcasting algorithm were developed by (9), and implemented in the NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian
Smoothing) package in R (10).

72

B. Initial Condition Estimation. The model requires appropriate mid-epidemic initial conditions in order to give relevant results.

In the model, the number of new hospitalizations at a given time – hnew , is directly proportional to the number of exposed
individuals at that time, therefore data was used to get an approximation of the number of exposed people. Also, to quantify
the number of people belonging to the recovered class, prevalence was used.
We can estimate the appropriate initial conditions by finding an approximation for our model that relates more directly to
the available data in each class. In the absence of the variant P.1, the model has four classes of infected compartments, namely
y = (E1 , A1 , I1 , H1 )T , and another three classes, represented by z, i.e., z = (S, R1 , D1 )T . To that effect, we can write the
system as

80

ẏ

=

F (y, z) − G(y, z),

[3]

81

ż

=

J(y, z) ,

[4]

84

where F comprises all entries of new Infected, coming from classes z, whilst G accounts for the transitions within infected
classes and also recovery and death from the disease. Then, to find a good approximation for a small time window, we perform
a linearization of our model around a point (y, z). Keeping z fixed, we get

85

ẏ = (F̂ − Ĝ)y ,

82
83

[5]

88

where F̂ and Ĝ are the linearized matrices arising from the functions F and G, respectively. The only entrance of new infected
comes from the βSλ/N terms in the Ė1 = (Ė1,y , Ė1,a , Ė1,e )T equations (sub-indexes are y young, a adults and e elderly), then,
the only non-zero elements of F̂ are in its first 3 lines. Before proceeding, it is useful to define

89

b̂ = diag(S)Ĉ

Ĝ contains the terms of Exposed, E1 , the 3 possible forms of the disease considered in the model (A1 , I1 and H1 ), as the
terms in its first 3 rows, , whilst the remainder of its main diagonal contains terms of recovery and death. For simplicity, every
constant (or vector for the terms with σ) in Ĝ expression Eq. (8) should be thought as diagonal matrices with its elements
given by the constants (or vectors) and every 0 is a 3-dimensional square matrix where all entries are null.

The linearization above implies that, for a small time interval, y has an exponential behavior and that the eigenvalues
of L̂ = F̂ − Ĝ are related to the exponential growth rates. Therefore, a short time after the beginning of the epidemic, the
largest eigenvalue should be the one to dominate. So the exponential growth rate of the wild-type variant – r, can be matched
to the largest eigenvalue of L̂ to obtain an estimate for β. The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue gives the
proportions of infected classes, which, together with the estimated number of exposed individuals – E1 = γ1 hnew /σ1 , results in
an approximation for the number of people in the other infected classes.
Given a β, the largest eigenvalue of the linearization matrix is computed using the eigs function of the R package rARPACK
(11) and we find the β that gives r as the largest eigenvalue through bisection root finding. Finally, subtracting the number of
recovered and infected from the total population gives the number of susceptible individuals.

C. Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Given the cumulative daily curves of hospitalization for wild-type variant, C1 , and P.1
variant, C2 , we can obtain the daily variation of each curve, namely ∆C1t and ∆C2t . Those curves are summed up to give the
total number of weekly new cases:

∆C τ =

(∆C1τ −1+i + ∆C2τ −1+i )

[9]

i=1
110
111
112

where τ is a discrete index given in weeks.
To calculate the frequency of P.1 in a given time period T , we use the proportion of new cases in this period from the
wild-type and P.1 variant as follows:

0

i=1

where t is a discrete index given in T periods.
The time period T depends on the dataset of genome sequences: it is daily in (12) and monthly in (13).
Using maximum likelihood, we fitted the model by estimating five parameters, namely, the relative transmissibility (∆β = ββ21 ),
the relative force of reinfection of P.1 (pr ), initial total prevalence (ρ0 = [R/N ]t=0 ), initial fraction of cases that were caused by
the new variant (P 0 ), and intrinsic growth rate of the wild-type variant (r). The initial fraction of P.1 cases (P 0 ) accounts for
the uncertainty in the time of emergence of the new variant: the simulation starts at beginning of November, so this initial value
is below 1 individual, and only reaches this threshold by mid- to late November, depending on the value of P 0 . The parameter
r incorporates effects related to contact rates for the wild-type variant, such as non-pharmacological interventions relaxation,
elections, and others; it affects the transmissibilities of both variants (β1 and β2 ) in the same way, and so is independent of ∆β.
Number of hospitalization cases were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, with expected value given by equation
Eq. (9). The recorded number of P.1 in genome samples was assumed to follow a binomial distribution with an expected value
equal to the product of the total number of genome sequences sampled in each date and the proportion of P.1 cases (equation
Eq. (10)). The log-likelihood function for the model fitting was then:

T
X

log Pois(xi |λ = C i ) +

X

log Bin(y j |N = nj , θ(π j ) = P j ) ,

[11]

j

where Pois is a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, xi is the number of recorded hospitalizations in week i, Bin is a Binomial
distribution with parameters N (total number of trials) and π j (probability of success at each trial), nj is total number of
sequences in clinical samples in week or day j, y j is the number of P.1 sequences in each of these samples, and θ(.) is the logit
function.
The model was then fitted by finding the values of the five above mentioned parameters that minimize the negative of the
log-likelihood function (equation 11), using the function mle2, from the R package bbmle (14).
To find starting values for the optimization performed by mle2 we calculated the log-likelihood function for one million
combinations of parameters values in a regular reticulate within reasonable ranges. The 100 sets of parameters that were local
minima and with highest log-likelihood were used as starting values for the computational minimization.
The confidence intervals for the expected number of cases and frequency were estimated from 20000 parametric bootstrap
samples assuming that the estimated parameters follow a multivariate normal distribution. The parameters of these multivariate
distributions were the estimated values and estimated variance-covariance matrix of the parameters. For each sampled
combination of para 2.5% and 95% quantiles of the distribution of bootstrapped expected values.

147

D. Sensitivity analysis. The model fitting assumed a constant infection hospitalization rate (IHR, parameter σ) for each age
group over time for both variants. Recent evidence suggests that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection protects most individuals against
reinfection (15), so reinfections might have lower IHR. Because the pathogenicity of the variant P.1 is unknown, the model
fitting was repeated assuming that the odds ratio of the IHR in each age class for P.1 infections compared to wild-type variant
infections (SA1) is a free parameter. Moreover, as the collapse of Manaus health system hindered hospitalizations of new severe
cases and may have affected case recording in surveillance databases, the model fitting was repeated considering only the
period prior to the collapse (10-January-2021) (SA2).
