Abstract
Importance: The outbreak of highly contagious COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to
human health, especially for those with underlying diseases. However, Impacts of COVID-19
epidemic on HD center and HD patients have not been reported.
Objective:

To summery an outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic in HD center.

Design, Setting, and Participants: We reviewed the epidemic course from the first
laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 infection on January 14 to the control of the
epidemic on March 12 in the HD center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Total 230
HD patients and 33 medical staff were included in this study
Exposures: COVID-19.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological

characteristics and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. 19 COVID-19 HD patients,
19 non-COVID-19 HD patients and 19 healthy volunteers were enrolled for further study
about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host immune responses.

Results:

42 out of 230 HD patients

（18.26%） and 4 out of 33 medical staffs（12.12%）

were diagnosed with COVID-19 from the outbreak to March 12, 2020. 13 HD patients
(5.65%), including 10 COVID-19 diagnosed, died during the epidemic. Only 2 deaths of the
COVID-19 HD patients were associated with pneumonia/lung failure. Except 3 patients were
admitted to ICU for severe condition (8.11%), including 2 dead, most COVID-19 diagnosed
patients presented mild or none-respiratory symptoms. Multiple lymphocyte populations in
HD patients were significantly decreased. HD patients with COVID-19 even displayed more
remarkable reduction of serum inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients.
HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD
centers are high risk area during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. HD Patients with
COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the
impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More
attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts
of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.
Conclusions and Relevance:

Introduction
Since December 2019, the initially outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) in Wuhan city has spread rapidly worldwide, becoming a serious
pandemic [1-6]. Epidemiological survey showed that COVID-19 patients with
underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the
elderly are not only susceptible, but also often more serious [7-10]. However, as far
as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease patients,
especially HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the large population
size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD treatment in 61
centers in Wuhan city.), high concentration of patients in HD center, and the
compromised immune function of uremic patients [11], the situation of HD patients
under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored.
In this study, we reviewed an outbreak of COVID-19 in one HD center in Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University, one of the largest hospitals located in the downtown of
Wuhan city. A cluster of HD patients contracted COVID-19 were surveyed and
followed until the day on March 12, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,
and radiological characteristics, and outcomes of some of these patients were
reviewed. We expect our findings will shed light on the appropriate management of
the HD center and HD patients in face of COVID-19 or other similar epidemic
emerging.

Methods
Study design and participants
We reviewed the epidemic course from the first laboratory-confirmed case of
COVID-19 infection on January 14 to March 12 in the HD center of Renmin Hospital
of Wuhan University. Total 230 HD patients and 33 medical staff were included in
this study. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus
Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition valid from Feb 4, 2020 to
Feb 17, 2020, 6th edition valid from Feb 18, 2020 to Mar 4, 2020, 7th edition valid

from Mar 4, 2020 until now) published by the National Health Commission of China
[12-14]. In the 5th edition, the suspect case of COVID-19 is defined as the one has the
epidemiological history or clinical presentations of fever, respiratory symptoms, or
decreased white blood cells or lymphocytes count. The clinical diagnosed case is
recognized when the suspect case displays the imaging features of pneumonia. The
confirmed case is identified if the suspected cases or clinical diagnosed case is
positive in pathogenic test. In the 6th and 7th edition, the definition of clinical
diagnosed case is removed. The suspect case should meet the criteria of
epidemiological history and clinical presentations. In the presence of pathogen
evidence, the suspect case should be confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. We followed
up all patients and collected the related clinical data. The study protocol was approved
by

the

Ethics

Committee

of

Renmin

Hospital

of

Wuhan

University

(WDRY2020-K064). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics
Commission of the hospital for emerging infectious diseases.

Data collection
The medical records of all participants were analyzed by the research team of the
Department of Nephrology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Epidemiological,
clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes data were obtained
with data collection forms from electronic medical records or specific data
questionnaire. Some data were retrieved from the Hubei Province kidney disease
quality control information platform. The data were reviewed by a trained team of
physicians. Information collected including demographic data, medical history,
underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, blood tests and chest computed
tomographic (CT) scans. During the period of follow up, the odd episode of death
were recorded and the presumed cause of death were carefully evaluated by the
research team, based on the time, place and clinical manifestations.

Virologic Studies
The SARS-CoV-2 detection was done by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) as described

previously [15]. Briefly, nasopharyngeal swab samples of participants were collected
for SARS-CoV-2 test with the detection kit (Bioperfectus, Taizhou, China). The
ORF1ab gene (nCovORF1ab) and the N gene (nCoV-NP) were used for real-time
RT-PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reaction mixture were prepared
and RT-PCR assay was then performed under the following conditions: incubation at
50 °C for 15 minutes and 95 °C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
15 seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 °C for 45 seconds.

Cellular immune profiling and cytokines measurement
To explore the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host immune responses, we
recruited 19 COVID-19 HD patients and 19 non-COVID-19 HD patients for further
blood sample collection with their permission. 19 Healthy volunteers were
simultaneously enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sera were
isolated. PBMCs were stained with a BD Multitest IMK Kit (Cat340503, BD

，

Biosciences) for analyzing the cell frequency of total T, CD4+ T CD8+ T, B and NK
cells in healthy controls and patients. The stained cells were acquired on a LSR
Fortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) and data analyzed using the FolwJo
software (TreeStar). Serum level of a panel of cytokines covering IL-4, IL-6, IL-10,
TNF-α, IFN-γ were assayed using Human Cytokine Standard 27-Plex Assays panel
and the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) for all patients according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. All experimental procedures were completed under
biosafety level II plus condition.

Statistical Analysis
The measured data were using median and interquartile range (IQR) values and
compared using independent group t test. Enumeration data were described as number
(%). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for
Statistical analysis), and a P value of less than 0.05 is considered as significant
difference.

Results
230 patients and 33 staff in our HD center were included in this study. The dynamic
course of COVID-19 epidemic from emerging to development is schematically
presented in Figure 1A. The first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on January 14,
and the second diagnosed patient appeared on January 17. Since January 21, patients
with COVID-19 had been quarantined and all medical staff had been asked to upgrade
their personal prevention and protection, which including wearing full protective gear
such as waterproof disposable gown, cap, gloves, face shield, and N95 face mask, and
more rigorous cleaning and disinfection. On February 4, 2 new patients and 3 medical
staffs were further confirmed with COVID-19. Therefore, the HD center decided to
screen all patients and staffs on February 4 with chest CT and optional blood test. On
February 10, there were 29 cases being diagnosed with COVID-19 including 29 HD
patients and 1 medical staff. On February 13, 2020, 4 more COVID-19 cases were
confirmed in HD patients. Since then, until the first screening was fully completed on
Feb 17, 2020, no new COVID-19 case occurred. In order to find out the potential
infected case in incubation period, we launched the second round of screening from
Feb 22, 2020 to Mar 3, 2020, and the third round of screening from Mar 3, 2020 to
Mar 12, 2020. There were 3 cases in 2nd screening, and 2 cases in 3rd screening, being
confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
During the period of screening, all infected patients and staffs were classified,
quarantined, or transferred to designated hospital according to the government
instruction. Figure 1B summarized the management flow and the outcomes of the
cluster. It showed that totally 42 (18.26%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19,
13 patients have died since the epidemic outbreak, including 10 patients contracted
COVID-19. Among the infected patients, 3 were admitted to ICU for severe
conditions and 2 had died later, the left one is in stable condition. We launched 3
rounds of screening to find out the infected patients in the HD center. The first round
started on Feb 4, 2020 and closed on Feb 17, 2020, with 37 patients being clinical
diagnosed of COVID-19. There were 10 patients were confirmed the diagnosis of

COVID-19 based on the positive test of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on
Nasopharyngeal swab. All of these 31 patients were transferred to the designated
hospitals, and the remaining stayed in our hospital under indicated quarantine or
isolation, followed by the 2nd screening, beginning on Feb 22, 2020. Three patients
were confirmed diagnosis and other 2 patients had died in this phase. The 3rd round of
screening was carried out on 187 patients and found out 2 patients contracted
COVID-19. As of Feb 14, 2020, there were 185 HD patients remaining in our hospital
and 32 in the designated hospital. All of the deaths were followed and reviewed by
our research team. Except 2 patients died in ICU, the other 11 cases died at home and
showed no obvious symptoms of pneumonia, their inferred cause of death was heart
failure, hyperkalemia and cerebrovascular disease, and none of them succumbed to
severe pneumonia based on the clinical manifestations (Figure 1B).
Demographic data of 42 COVID-19 HD patients were summarized in Table 1.
Among 15 confirmed diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 10 were male and 5 were female,
with median age of 71 years. 27 clinical diagnosed COVID-19 patients contain 15
male and 12 female, with median age of 61 years. Hematology abnormalities such as
lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are common in COVID-19 patients as
previous reports [7, 8, 16, 17]. These features were also present in the COVID-19
contracted HD patients (Table 2). With respect to the clinical symptoms in HD
patients with COVID-19, we found that symptoms of fever, fatigue, dry cough, chest
pain, as well as nausea, were either not common (Table 2). Radiological detection by
chest CT scan showed that 2 (13%) confirmed diagnosed patients and 8 (30%) clinical
diagnosed patients had unilateral involvement, 12 (80%) confirmed diagnosed
patients and 19 (70%) clinical diagnosed patients had bilateral involvement. 12 (80%)
confirmed diagnosed patients and 15 (65%) clinical diagnosed patients had multiple
“ground-glass opacity” lesions in the lung (Table 2 and Figure 2). These clinical
manifestations indicated that most COVID-19 infected HD patients are in mild
conditions, which is quite different from previous findings on other patients with
comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the elderly [7,
8, 16].

The immune system plays an essential role in protecting host from pathogens
invasion. Once SARS-CoV-2 infected the host’s respiratory tract, it multiplies in cells
of the airway, triggering extensive immune activation and releasing massive
proinflammatory cytokines. This “cytokine storm” effects are responsible for severe
conditions or even eventually lead to death in COVID-19 patients [16]. Above results
indicated that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in mild condition. We
speculated that this might be related to the compromised immunity in HD patients. To
test this hypothesis, we enumerated the absolute numbers of T cells, NK cells, as well
as B cells in PBMCs of HD patients in the presence of absence of SARS-CoV-2
infection. We found that the numbers of T cells, Th cells, killer T cells, NK cells and
B lymphocytes in PBMCs of HD patients were very low compared with those of non
HD patients. Those numbers in HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was further
decreased (Figure 3A). Similar to the numbers of lymphocytes, we also observed that
the serum levels of IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α in non HD patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection were significantly higher than the normal level, while the serum levels of
these cytokines in HD patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection are
significantly lower than those in non HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure
3B). These results suggest that HD patients have compromised immune system,
which may be detrimental for mounting effective anti-viral responses, but beneficial
for limiting tissue damages by dampening the cytokine release.

Discussion
COVID-19 epidemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has swept many countries and
regions around the world and sparked an alarming of pandemic by the World Health
Organizatino [4]. Previous epidemiological survey showed that the elderly or patients
with comorbidities were more susceptible to COVID-19, and the incidence of severe
cases and the risk of death were high [16, 18-20]. However, there is no report about
the impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients. HD patients are distinct different
cluster from other population because: 1. They make up a large scale cluster; 2. They

usually receive concentrated dialysis treatment in a large space; 3. Their immune
functions are compromised; 4. Once they are infected, they may become potential
“super-spreaders”. Considering these natures, HD patients and HD centers should be
given priority in epidemic prevention and control. According to our investigation on
single center, the infection rate of HD patients in the COVID-19 epidemic is indeed
much higher than that of other population, and the staffs in HD center are also at high
risk to infection.
Reviewing the epidemic situation in our center can bring some important
experiences and lessons. The COVID-19 epidemic initially emerged in our center on
January 14, 2020, but until January 21, actions were taken by our center to stand up to,
we must admitted that the best time has missed. Nevertheless, series of measures
including upgrading prevention and protection, quarantine and isolation, seem to be
effective to contain the epidemic, but the most critical means we think is thoroughly
finding out the infected cases by repeated screening, which is mainly based on the
results of chest CT scan.
During the outbreak of COVID-19 in our center, 13 episodes of death were
recorded, with a mortality of 5.65%, which is far higher than that of the same period
in history. The high mortality is obviously related to the epidemic situation. However,
it was found that only 2 deaths were pneumonia directly related. The main causes of
death were cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications or hyperkalemia, which
was presumed due to the reduction of dialysis times for fear of contracting the virus. It
should be noted that although HD patients are highly susceptible to COVID-19, the
infection for them is likely less severe or fatal. Actually, only 3 of 42 infected patients
were admitted to ICU. Some infected patients even have no obvious clinical
symptoms. These suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic emerging,
measures of prevention and protection certainly should be taken to avoid infection,
but the sufficient dialysis remains the essential for patients to survive the epidemic.
During the outbreak of SARS in 2003, it was observed that the severity and mortality
of HD patients infected with SARS-CoV were similar to other infected population,
but the duration of shedding virus through stool or breath was significantly longer

than other patients [21]. Considering the high biological similarity between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we estimate that HD patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 will take longer to clear the virus, and these patients may need longer
quarantine period to prevent the spread of infection.
Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can reduce the number of
lymphocytes in patients, but the level of inflammatory cytokines in vivo increases
significantly. Cytokine storm may be the key cause of the worsened condition and
even death [16]. We tested the frequency of immune cells in the PBMCs of patients
with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and the level of cytokines in the body of
patients. The results showed that compared with the general population, the T cells,
Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells was reduced remarkably in PBMCs of HD
patients, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the serum level of serial
cytokines of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α in SARS-CoV-2 infected HD patients remain
relatively lower in comparison with non-HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
This indicates that the impaired immune system seems to be unable to mount effective
cellular immune response upon the invasion of SARS-CoV-2, thus results in no
cytokine storm and no severe organs damage. In the current clinical guidelines and
practice for COVID-19 therapy, glucocorticoids are recommended and usually
prescribed [7, 12]. However, with regard to the management of COVID-19 in HD
patients, we suggest the administration of glucocorticoids should be prudent since the
immune system in HD patients have already been suppressed [22-24].

Figure 1

．A: The schematic diagram of dynamic course about COVID-19 epidemic in our HD

center. The first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on January 14. The second patient was
diagnosed on January 17. The personal prevention and protection of medical staff was upgraded
on January 21. 2 new patients and 3 medical staff were confirmed with COVID-19 on February 4.
29 HD patients and 1 medical staff were diagnosed on February 10. 4 new HD patients were
diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 13. 3 cases were confirmed in the 2nd round of screening,
and 2 cases were confirmed in the 3rd round of screening. B: The management flow and the
outcomes of the cluster in the epidemic. In the 1st round of screening, 37 patients were diagnosed
with COVID-19 in our center. Among them, 10 patients had died. 3 infected patients were
admitted to ICU for severe conditions and 2 had died. In the 2nd round of screening, 3 patients
were confirmed. In the 3rd round of screening, 2 patients were confirmed. All of the diagnosed
patients were transferred to the designated hospitals.

．

Figure 2 Representative images of chest CT scans (the transverse plane). Patients with COVID-19
had unilateral or bilateral pneumonia. The multiple “ground-glass” lesions were the characteristics
of COVID-19 pneumonia. The green arrows represent the sites of lesions.

．

Figure 3 A: The frequency of immunocytes in the PBMCs of patients with or without COVID-19.
The proportion of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells and B cells of HD patients decreased significantly
than other groups. Meanwhile, the proportion of these cells in patients with COVID-19 was
decreased than healthy volunteers group. B: The serum level of cytokines in indicated patients.
The values of IL4, IL6 and TNFα in non-HD COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than
those in HD patients with COVID-19.
