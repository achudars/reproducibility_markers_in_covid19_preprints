Abstract
Background: On December 2019, Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in
Wuhan, China, and then spread around the world. There is little information about effects of
COVID-19 on Pregnant women and newborns as a sensitive population. The current study is a
systemic review and Meta-analysis to measure the risks and determine the presentations of
COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborn.
Methods: online data bases were searched on march 20. Heterogeneity of the included studies was
assessed using the Cochran Q test and Higgins I2 statistic and expressed as percentage. All data
were analyzed with 95% confidence intervals.
Results: A total of 7 studies involving 50 participants with Positive test of COVID-19 were
enrolled. Mean age of pregnant women was 30.57 years old and the Mean Gestational age was

36.9 weeks. Other variables such as Apgar score, birth weight, Sign and symptoms, Complications
and Laboratory data were Analyzed.
Conclusion: Our findings showed same clinical characteristics in pregnant women as in nonpregnant adults, with the main symptoms being cough and fever. No vertical transmission was
seen and all patients delivered healthy neonates. Our findings would be of great help to the decision
making process, regarding the management of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19.

Introduction:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly since
December 2019, in Wuhan, China, with an estimated mortality risk of ~2% (1). Followed by
SARS-CoV-2 , an epidemic outburst in other regions of the country and worldwide is happening
(2).
Coronaviruses mainly create enzootic infections in mammals and birds; lately, a capability to
infect humans has been demonstrated as well (3). In less than seven days, the clinical symptoms
begin, such as fever, fatigue, nasal congestion, cough, and other indications of upper respiratory
tract involvements. Then, it can develop to a severe form of disease with severe chest symptoms
and dyspnea, in about 75% of patients. In the day of 10 to 14 of a symptomatic infection, the
pneumonia mostly occurs. Noticeable indications of viral pneumonia, such as blood gas deviations,
and low oxygen saturation, leading to apparent alterations in chest X-rays, and finally lung
abnormalities have been seen. Lymphopenia and elevation of inflammatory markers seems to be
common (1, 4).
In cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, some studies described the medical,
experimental, epidemiological and radiological specifications, as well as potential therapy and
clinical end-results of patients (1, 5). However, no reliable evidence is as yet available to
demonstrate clinical feature of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women.
The new coronavirus is genetically closer to SARS-CoV-1, and homology modelling has showed
that it has a receptor binding domain structure like SARS-CoV-1, suggesting a comparable
pathogenesis with SARS-CoV-1 infection (6). Recent studies have revealed that pregnant women
with SARS-CoV-1 show high occurrence of adverse maternal and neonatal complications
including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth limitation, renal failure,

endotracheal intubation usage and the intensive care unit admission and minimal chance of vertical
transmission (7, 8).
Some investigations reported the medical manifestation and vertical transmission of COVID-19 in
pregnancies (9-11). Because of the low power of study and small quantity of the samples, there
are many essential questions that have to be addressed quickly, including whether severity of
symptoms is the greater in pregnant women with COVID-19 as the sensitive population, if
expecting mothers with COVID-19 die or give birth earlier, and finally whether COVID-19 could
disseminate vertically and infect the embryo. Therefore, to better manage the infection of pregnant
women, the present systematic review and meta-analysis has been launched to evaluate clinical
manifestation of COVID-19 in the aﬀected expecting women and assess its effect on the pregnancy
end-results and neonatal well-being.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
A systematic search was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to
identify published studies included epidemiological studies and case-control studies. the 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There were two independent reviewers 2019nCoV, respectively. We used “2019 Novel coronavirus”, “Wuhan virus”, "covid-19" and "
Pregnancy ", "gestation" to identify the relevant studies. For the 2019-nCoV, we searched for all
studies published in all language between till 20 March 2020. We used English and Chinese
studies.

Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was performed using “metan” and “metaprop” programs in STATA version 11
(STATA, College Station, TX, USA) based on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection as
input. The meta-analysis resulted in pooled (overall) mean and prevalence of characteristics with
a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed using the
Cochran Q test and Higgins’ I2 statistic and expressed as percentage. Values of 25%, 50%, and
75% for I2 were considered as low, medium, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively. Data
were pooled using fixed or random effects model as appropriate. Publication bias was tested using
Begg and Egger’s tests.
Results
The schematic diagram of selection process and meta-analysis is shown in Figure 1. Seven studies
with 50 participants have been included. Mean age of pregnant women included in this metaanalysis was 30.82 years old (95% CI: 28.54 – 33.10; Table 2 & Fig.2).
The pool mean of gestational age of pregnant women was 37.21 weeks, (95% CI: 34.54 – 39.87;
I2= 100%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001; Table 2 & Fig.3), (Begg’s test P=0. 649, Egger’s test P=1).
Four studies were combined to pool the mean of WBC count of pregnant women ( 9.51 × 10⁹ cells
per dL, 95% CI: 7.89 – 11.12; I2= 100%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001; Table 2 & Fig.4). (Begg’s test
P=0.718, Egger’s test P=1).
the mean of C reactive protein of pregnant women was 16.83 mg/L, (95% CI: 10.87 – 22.79; I2=
100%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001; Table 2 & Fig.5),(Begg’s test P=0.718, Egger’s test P=1).
Birth weight of pregnant women's babies was 3.2 kg,( 95% CI: 3.2 – 3.2; I2= 0%; P-heterogeneity
= 0.741; Table 2 & Fig.6), (Begg’s test P=1, Egger’s test P=0.197).

Five studies were combined to pool the mean of Apgar score of infants , which was 9.43( 95% CI:
8.98 – 9.89; I2= 100%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001; Table 2 & Fig.7). There was no significant study
bias (Begg’s test P=0.782, Egger’s test P=1).
Fever had the highest overall prevalence among clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection of
pregnant women. We achieved an overall fever prevalence of 77% (95%-CI, 57–93%; I2= 0%; Pheterogeneity = 0.62; Table 2), (Begg’s test P=1, Egger’s test P=0.852). The cough symptom was
in the next rank with prevalence of 20% (95%-CI; 2–46%; I2= 31.6%; P-heterogeneity = 0.21;
Table 2). There was no significant study bias (Begg’s test P=0.624, Egger’s test P=0.466).
We achieved an overall premature prevalence of 20% (95%-CI, 4–41%; I2= 28.67%; Pheterogeneity = 0.21; Table 2 & Fig.9) through the meta-analysis with 7 studies included. There
was no significant study bias (Begg’s test P=0.548, Egger’s test P=0.434).
In this meta-analysis, we achieved an overall prevalence of more than 99% (95%-CI, 95–100%;
I2= 0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.45; Table 2 & Fig.8) for cesarean section (C-section) through the
combining 7 studies included. There was no significant study bias (Begg’s test P=0.133, Egger’s
test P=0.573).
In this meta-analysis, we achieved an overall prevalence of 61% (95%-CI, 32–87%; I2= 4.66%; Pheterogeneity = 0.37; Table 2 & Fig.11) for affecting other family of participants through the
combining 4 studies included. There was no significant study bias (Begg’s test P=0.279, Egger’s
test P=0.783).
The current meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of death, preeclampsia, asphyxia, malaise,
rigor, diarrhea, chest pain and fatigue is zero among pregnant women (Table 2). We achieved an
overall prevalence of 8%, 7%, 2%, 1%, 10% and 3% for PROM (Prelabor rupture of membranes),
fetal distress, postpartum fever, myalgia, dyspnea and sore throat, respectively (Table 2).

Discussion
The emergence of the epidemic raised concerns regarding pregnant women as high-risk
individuals. The prevention and management of COVID-19 in pregnant women and the possible
risk of vertical transmission become the main concern (9). This meta-analysis is the first study to
achieve a comprehensive pattern of the COVID-19 clinical features in pregnant women. We
included seven studies with a total of 50 patients from China. The mean age of pregnant patients
was 30-year old and all were in third trimesters at the time of manifestation.
The most pregnant patients with COVID-19 manifested mild to moderate signs, commonly fever
(77 %) and cough (20%). The other symptoms prevalence and biochemical characterization are
similar to non-pregnant patients with 2019-nCov infection (12). Respiratory viral diseases are
indistinguishable from 2019-nCov infection due to nonspecific symptoms. To date, the laboratory
tests have low specificity and cannot be used for definitive diagnosis of the COVID-19, and can
only estimate the patient's clinical condition, therefore PCR and radiological studies will be
performed to confirm the disease (12).
This comprehensive study showed that the mortality rate is zero, although the sample size was
limited. Also, there was no asphyxia, preeclampsia, rigor, malaise, chest pain, diarrhea and fatigue
among pregnant women. However, differences in the quality of treatment in different countries
(13) and virus genomic variation during spread (14) may cause these symptoms to show different
rates elsewhere. In addition to the limiting number of studies included in this meta-analysis,
another caveat is that all included studies were from China.
The results of four studies showed that 61% of the affected family members also had the disease.

Because of close contact with the patient's aerosols, the patient's family members are at greater
risk.
This meta-analysis showed that all pregnant women underwent C-section. It is not clear that the
vertical transmission risk of 2019-nCov in C-section is lower than vaginal delivery (15). It seems
that physicians think C-section is the better option for delivery. The surgery should be done in a
negative-pressure operating room, and doctors should follow some protective measures like using
a N95 mask, wearing a medical protective suit and goggles to avoid contamination with droplets
from the surgical site (16).
Our analysis showed that all pregnant women delivered live and healthy infants that were negative
tested for 2019-nCov. This result indicates that the possibility of vertical transmission is very low,
and performing intra-operative hygiene procedures and transferring the baby to an isolated ward
will help to protect the baby from getting infected with COVID-19.
Conclusion
the clinical features of pregnant women and non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID19, are the same and the main symptoms were cough and fever among them. There is no evidence
for vertical transmission in the third trimester of pregnancy, and all pregnant patients delivered
healthy infants. Despite the limitations of this study, including the low number of studies included
and being specific to China, regarding to emergency of the COVID-19 emergency, our findings
would be of great help in making decision regarding to management and control of pregnant
women with COVID-19.
