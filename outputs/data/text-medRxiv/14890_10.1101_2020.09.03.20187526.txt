ABSTRACT:
Objective: To systematically review the safety and efficacy outcomes of using antivirals for the
treatment of COVID-19.
Methods: Five databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug
interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with
corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models.
Results: A total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals
had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89,
P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals
compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05).
Conclusion: There is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that
patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to
patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not
possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal
approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.

Manuscript Title: Safety and Efficacy of Antiviral Drugs for the Treatment of Patients with SARS-CoV-2
Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analyses

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogen. One of the
characteristics of COVID-19 is that it is highly contagious, as of August 27 it has caused more than 24.2
million cases and over 826,743 deaths in 188 countries worldwide. The number of cases of COVID-19
continues to increase but there is no approved vaccine or medication that can be used for treatment.
The repurposed antivirals that are being used as investigational drugs to treat COVID-19 are Favipiravir,
Umifenoviridol, a combination of Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r), and Remdesivir (Sanders et al., 2020).
These antivirals have been shown to have activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (McKee et al., 2020).
Favipiravir and umifenovir are available in Russia and some Asian countries for the treatment of
influenza (Wu et al., 2020). Lopinavir-ritonavir is a combined protease inhibitor, which has primarily
been used for HIV infection. To date, Remdesivir is the only antiviral to receive emergency approval from
the Food Drug Administration (FDA) (Gilead Sciences, n.d., p. 19) in the United States and exception
approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) (Gilead Sciences, n.d., p.
19) to treat adults or children who are hospitalized with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 and whose
condition is “severe”.
The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) and the meta-analyses is to assess the safety and
efficacy of the antiviral drugs that have been proposed to treat COVID-19. The multiple uncertainties
about COVID-19 and a large amount of ongoing research make it necessary to provide the scientific
community with high-quality, timely, and living systematic reviews of the relevant evidence.

The protocol for this systematic review and the meta-analyses was based on the PRISMA statement. This
protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO database with registration number CRD42020184247.
We included all completed and published clinical studies that evaluated the role of antiviral drugs on
SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. The literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Medrxiv, Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and LitCOVID databases from inception to 27-Aug-2020
to find articles providing information on the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs in patients with
SARS-CoV-2. No language restrictions were imposed and the search was expanded using a snowballing
method applied to the references of retrieved papers.

The exclusion criteria consisted of studies that did not report clinical data. Two authors (ZAT and TM)
independently screened the titles and abstracts and the full-texts of potentially relevant articles, using
Rayyan software (Ouzzani et al., 2016). Three authors extracted data using a custom spreadsheet to
record the study characteristics and study outcomes (mortality, total adverse events (AE), serious
adverse events (SAE), and time to a negative PCR test).

Our primary analysis was focused on the safety and efficacy outcomes of the different antiviral therapies
proposed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Risk of bias assessment and quality of the evidence assessment
For Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs)

we used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (RoB) assessment tool

consisting of seven domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective
outcome reporting, and other bias (Higgins et al., 2011). For cohort studies, we used the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) consisting of three domains (selection of exposure, comparability, and
assessment of outcome) (Wells GA，Shea B，O’Connell D, et a1．, n.d.). Two reviewers assessed the

risk of bias of the articles independently with the good inter-rater agreement (κ=0.75; p<0.001). If the
two reviewers did not reach consensus, a third reviewer made the final decision.

Statistical analysis
Meta-analyses for all outcomes were first performed by pooling the results of all antivirals.
Meta-analyses for specific drugs were performed if two or more studies were identified. To assess
safety,

AE rates were pooled and a list of adverse events for each drug was created (Supplementary

Table 2). To assess efficacy, the following outcomes were included in separate meta-analyses: clinical
improvement rates at day 7, 14, & 28, chest CT-improvement and 28-days mortality wherever feasible.
All meta-analyses were carried out using the RevMan software. All of the outcomes included in the
meta-analysis were binary and were summarized using risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI using a random-effects
model. Both peer-reviewed as well as non-peer-reviewed studies were pooled in the meta-analyses. I2
testing was used to quantify heterogeneity between studies, values > 50% represented
moderate-to-high heterogeneity. Statistical analysis with a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
The electronic searches identified 379 records. Following the screening of titles and abstracts and
removing duplicates, we evaluated 20 relevant full text articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. After
full-text review, an additional 6 articles were excluded, 4 because the studies were ongoing and 2
because they did not include the outcomes of interest. Finally, we found 14 relevant articles suitable for
final inclusion, 10 of the studies were included in the meta-analyses (4 RCTs and 6 observational
studies). The remaining studies were not included in the analysis because they didn’t fulfil the inclusion
criteria.

Risk of bias assessment:
We used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for the RCTs evaluation of the risk of bias. The risk of bias in the
included RCTs was high, as they did not perform optimal allocation concealment and blindness for
patients and clinicians. Wang et al was the study with the highest quality given that it included
randomization and allocation concealment; however, it presented insufficient statistical power to detect
real differences in the outcomes (Wang et al., 2020). All of the cohort studies had a high risk of bias, the
main reasons were the lack of controlling for important factors that would influence the primary study
results, lack of long enough follow-up for outcomes to occur, and inadequate outcome ascertainment.
Another source of bias was the small sample size in the studies.

Study characteristics and participant characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs):
A total of 6 RCT studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 1,784 (951 cases and 833
controls) patients evaluated. All of the included antiviral studies included either LPV/r, LPV/r +
Umifenoviridol, Remdesivir, or Favipiravir as the intervention or comparator, the duration of the therapy
ranged from 5 days (Wang et al., 2020) to 21 days (Li et al., 2020). LPV/r and Ritonavir doses were
similar, the doses used in the study by Cao et al and in the study by Li et al., patients in the Li et al study
were given a dose of LPV/r of 200mg/50mg (Li et al., 2020) compared to 400mg/100mg for patients in
the Cao et al study (Cao et al., 2020). The mean age of the cases ranged from 58 to 66 years of age
compared to controls whose mean age ranged from 58 to 64 years of age (Cao et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2020).

There were five studies that reported AE (Beigel et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Li et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020). In all trials

(Umifenoviridol, Favipiravir, LPV, Remdesivir) there were

gastrointestinal and liver AE reported, except for one trial (Beigel et al., 2020). Umifenoviridol and
Favipiravir had no SAE. Serious adverse events (SAE) present in LPV/r and Remdesivir were acute kidney
injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, hemorrhage of the lower digestive tract,
and septic shock. Figure 1 shows the most common AE.
Cao et al reported AE of any grade in 48.4% of the patients in the LPV/r group and 49.5% in the standard
care group (supplemental oxygen, noninvasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, vasopressor
support,

renal-replacement

therapy,

and

extracorporeal

membrane

oxygenation

(ECMO)).

Gastrointestinal AEs were more common in the LPV/r group, but SAE were more common in the
standard-care group (Cao et al., 2020). LPV/r treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%)
because of AE.
Li et al reported that 35.3% had AEs in the LPV/r group when compared to 14.3% in the Umifenovir
group (Li et al., 2020). One SAE occurred in the LPV/r group. Wang, et al reported 102 (66%) of 155
patients in the Remdesivir group and 50 (64%) of 78 in the control group. The Remdesivir group
reported 28 (18%) and 20 (26%) in the control group (Wang et al., 2020). Beigel et al reported that SAE
occurred in 114 patients (21.1%) in the Remdesivir group and 141 patients (27.0%) in the placebo group
(Beigel et al., 2020). Chen et al reported a total of 37 (31.9%) of AEs in the Favipiravir group and 28
(23.3%) in the Umifenovir group (Chen et al., 2020).

Clinical Improvement at day 7, 14, and 28:
Cao et al reported that the percentage of patients with clinical improvement at day 7, 14 and 28 was
higher in the LPV/r group than in the standard care group (day 7: 6% vs. 2%; day 14: 45.5% vs. 30.0%;
day 28: 78.8% vs. 70.0%) (Cao et al., 2020). The study by Li et al showed no statistical differences of

clinical improvement at day 7 nor at day 14 between the three groups (P > 0.05) (Li et al., 2020).
Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1.23
[95% CI: 0.87–1.75]). The study showed a slightly higher improvement between the Remdesivir group
compared to controls (day 7: 3% vs. 3%; day 14: 27% vs. 23%; day 28: 65% vs. 58%) (Wang et al., 2020).

28-day mortality:
Mortality (28-day) was reported in only two studies (Cao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Cao et al
showed some evidence that LPV/r reduces mortality at 28 days (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8
percentage points (95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7) (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al reported similar 28-day mortality
between the two groups, 14% for the Remdesivir group compared to 13% of the control groups;
difference 1.1% (95% CI, –8.1 to 10.3). In patients with the use of Remdesivir within 10 days after
symptom onset, 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups (Wang et al., 2020).

Meta-analyses for RCTs:
Antivirals vs controls
Four studies were included in the meta-analyses that compared antivirals vs placebo or standard of care
(controls) of data (Beigel et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). These
encompassed 829 cases and 716 controls. There was no statistical difference in AE when comparing
antivirals with controls (RR, 0.95 CI, 0.80 to 1.35, P=0.52, I​2​=32%). However there was a significant
difference with SAE (RR, 0.74, CI, 0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002, I​2​=0.00]. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less
risk of having a SEA compared to controls. This protective effect was not seen in the study that included
a placebo as a control group.
There was no significant difference in the clinical improvement at day 7 and 28 among the cases treated
with antivirals (RR, 1.09 CI, 0.55 to 2.15, P=0.80), (RR, 1.13 CI, 0.99 to 1.29, P=0.08] respectively. Clinical
improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control

group (RR, 1.24 CI, 1.00 to 1.53, p=0.05). Outcome related to 28-day mortality was not statistically
significant among the cases and controls (RR, 0.87 CI, 0.57 to 1.33, P=0.52) (figure 2).

When stratifying the meta-analyses by specific antiviral there were no statistical differences between
the antiviral and the control group. The heterogeneity and the confidence intervals were wide for the
less SAE comparison, showing a lack of power.

Meta-analysis for observational studies:
Figures 5-7 (supplementary) show the meta-analyses in which there were two or more studies available.
There was no statistical difference for nCOV negativity improvement at day 14 or mortality when
comparing among the antivirals. Patients exposed to LPV/r had a chest improvement when compared to
Umifenovir (RR 1.45, CI 1.04-2.04, p=0.03) (Deng et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Zhu et al.,
2020).

DISCUSSION
The results of the meta-analyses do not show evidence of clinical improvement or reduced mortality for
any antiviral agent in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. There is evidence from single studies
that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay. In addition, evidence derived from a
meta-analysis of observational studies shows that patients exposed to LPV/r had chest X-Ray
improvement when compared to Umifenovir. Concerning SAE it was observed that patients to which
antivirals were administered had less SAE compared to patients without antivirals. The results of the
meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution due to a lack of statistical power and a lack of
high-quality RCTs.

The AEs reported with all antivirals were related to gastrointestinal symptoms and to abnormal liver
function tests. SAE present in LPV/r and Remdesivir were acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, hemorrhage of the lower digestive tract, and septic shock. When interpreting these results
one has to take into account that these outcomes might be associated with the symptoms of COVID-19
and its severity. Future studies need to determine if these outcomes are related to the disease or to the
treatment.

Since all of the studies included in the meta-analyses had different types of limitations, it is important to
focus on the systematic review and evaluate single studies with high quality. The study by Wang et al.
was the only study with high quality. It was the first placebo-controlled, double-blinded RCT. Even
though the study was conducted in ten hospitals, the study ended prematurely after including 237
patients due to slow recruitment, which meant the trial was underpowered and the outcome was
inconclusive. The study showed that patients treated with Remdesivir within 10 days after the onset of
clinical symptoms had a reduction of time on mechanical ventilation and a faster clinical improvement (2
days shorter) compared to standard therapy. In addition, the study by Beigel et al showed that
Remdesivir shortened the time to recovery in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Beigel et al., 2020).
Further clinical trial is warranted to clarify and strengthen the effect of Remdesivir on COVID-19
patients.

Concerning the results of LPV/r, it is important to note that the studies presented major limitations
including the risk of bias and lack of power, therefore high quality is needed before a conclusion can be
made. In vitro studies showed that LPC/r had antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Choy et al., 2020; Li and
De Clercq, 2020). In addition, the results of clinical studies reported that patients treated with LPV/r had
a reduction in intubation rate and mortality with Lopinavir/Ritonavir in SARS patients.

Meta-analyses are used to increase the lack of statistical power when studies are small. Given that very
few studies have been published we decided to include 2 pre-publications (non-peer-reviewed) (Lan et
al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). The advantage of including these studies is that it increases the size of the
meta-analyses and reduces the risk of publication bias which occurs when positive results get published
sooner than negative results. Sensitivity analyses were performed by removing these two studies, and
the results did not change.

Given the sparse data that is available, it was not possible to conduct meta-analyses for each individual
drug nor to study the heterogeneity. The difference between studies is that they included a range of
treatment dosages, frequencies, and routes of administration. Some studies compared an antiviral with
a placebo and other antivirals vs standard of treatment. Since a standard of treatment has not been
determined, it is important that studies describe clearly what they are including as standard of
treatment. In addition, there is evidence that different treatments might have different efficacies at
different stages of illness, therefore studies should stratify by the severity of the disease instead of
encompassing all patients (Wiersinga et al., 2020). It would be beneficial that after this pandemic,
consortia developed an emergency template protocol that could be used in future infectious pandemics.
By standardizing methodologies, definitions, and outcomes, the quality of meta-analyses would increase
leading to faster treatment.

These first studies need to be taken as an initial exploration of a potential treatment for patients that
are seriously ill and should only be taken as a first step to guide the treatment and research in the short
term. As a medium-term plan, we are awaiting the results of large studies such as the WHO clinical trial
SOLIDARITY (Kupferschmidt, 2020) and the Randomized Evaluation of COVID (RECOVERY) trial from the
University of Oxford (Recovery Trial, n.d.) which will focus on the need for hospitalization or ventilation
and will evaluate the survival (mortality). In the longer term, there is a need for large high-quality

studies, which will carry more weight than meta-analyses that include lower quality studies. There is a
need for large, well-controlled, randomized studies that besides evaluating safety and efficacy, can also
answer questions. Some of the questions that need to be answered are: At what stage of the disease
should antivirals be prescribed? At what dosages? Should more than one antiviral be prescribed? What
patients (e.g. age, comorbidities, comedications) benefit the most? What treatments are safer for
specific subpopulations (e.g., pregnant women, underlying COPD). There are many questions that still
need to be answered, however, at this stage, systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be useful to
lead the research and development of further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
The results of this systematic review and meta-analyses have an overview of the first studies published
and guide future studies on what should be considered when starting a clinical trial. There is evidence
that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were
administered had less SAE when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of
power and quality of the studies, it was not possible to make a definite conclusion, and therefore the
optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.
