ABSTRACT

2

Background: Social distance, quarantine, pathogen testing and other preventive

3

strategies implemented during COVID-19 pandemic may negatively influence the

4

management of acute stroke. Objective: The current study aimed to evaluate the

5

impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment delay of acute stroke in China.

6

Methods: This study included patients with acute stroke admitted in two hospitals in

7

Jiangsu, China. Patients admitted before and after the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak

8

(January 31, 2020, as officially announced by Chinese government) were compared

9

for pre- (measured as onset-to-door time) and post-hospital delay (measured as

10

door-to-needle time). The influence factors for delayed treatment (indicated as

11

onset-to-needle time >4.5 hours) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression

12

analysis.

13

Results: Onset-to-door time increased from 202 min (IQR 65-492) before to 317 min

14

(IQR 75-790) after the COVID-19 pandemic (P=0.001). Door-to-needle time

15

increased from 50min (IQR 40-75) before to 65 min (IQR 48-84) after the COVID-19

16

pandemic (P=0.048). The proportion of patients with intravenous thrombolysis in

17

those with acute ischemic stroke was decreased significantly after the pandemic (15.4%

18

vs 20.1%; P=0.030). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients

19

after COVID-19 pandemic, lower educational level, rural residency, mild symptoms

20

and transported by other means than ambulance were associated with delayed

21

treatment.

22

Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic has remarkable impacts on the management of

23

acute ischemic stroke. Both pre- and post-hospital delays were prolonged significantly,

24

and proportion of patient arrived within the 4.5-hour time window for intravenous

25

thrombolysis treatment was decreased. Given that anti-COVID-19 measures are

Introduction

33

Recently developed treatments, such as intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical

34

thrombectomy, can significantly improve the outcomes of acute ischemic stroke. But

35

the effects of these treatments were highly time-dependent, which emphasize the

36

importance of rapid pre- and post-hospital managements. For selected patients with

37

onset-to-needle time (ONT) shorter than 4.5 hours, intravenous thrombolysis could be

38

applied. But those with ONT shorter than 3 hours had a higher likelihood of 90-day

39

favorable outcome [1]. For selected patients with onset-to-puncture time (OPT)

40

shorter than 6 hours, mechanical thrombectomy could be applied. Although patients

41

with OPT between 6 and 24 hours still could be screened for mechanical

42

thrombectomy, the effects attenuate rapidly with time delay. Current guidelines

43

recommended that extra imaging examinations should be performed for selecting

44

patients with OPT between 6 and 24 hours for mechanical thrombectomy [2,3].

45

Therefore, when applying intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in

46

acute ischemic stroke patients, the shorter the treatment delays, the better the

47

functional outcomes.

48

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, China has implemented several

49

nation-wide strategies for preventing and containing the spread of the disease [4].

50

Social distance, quarantine, pathogen testing and other strategies were taken from

51

January 31, 2020, as officially announced by Chinese government. These measures

52

influenced not only the regular medical procedures, but also the health-seeking

53

behaviors. All these changes may have influenced the management of stroke, but the

54

impacts are largely undetermined [5]. This study aimed to explore the impact and

55

extent of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment delay of acute stroke in China.

56

Additionally, we probed potential factors responsible for the treatment delay.

Methods

58

Study design and patient population

59

This study is a part of an on-going program for analyzing pre- and post-hospital delay

60

in managing stroke patients. Patients with acute stroke were enrolled in 2 tertiary

61

hospitals in Jiangsu Province. On January 31, 2020, Chinese government announced

62

several nation-wide strategies for preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. To evaluate

63

the impacts of the pandemic on stroke management, patients with acute stroke within

64

2 months before and after this time point were analyzed in this study. Acute stroke

65

was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and CT or MRI scans. Patients who

66

reached the hospitals within 7 days after stroke onset were included. All participants

67

and their relatives provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by

68

the ethics committees of the participated hospital.

69

Treatment Delay Assessment

70

Demographic and clinical data were collected after hospitalization. Onset-to-door

71

time (ODT) was defined as the duration from stroke symptom onset or time last

72

known well to hospital arrival, which included awareness time, decision time and

73

transporting time. Decision time is defined as the duration from symptom onset to the

74

decision being made to go to hospital. Door-to-needle time (DNT) was defined as the

75

time from hospital arrival to the start of intravenous thrombolysis. For those who did

76

not meet the criteria of intravenous thrombolysis, DNT was based on a presumed

77

thrombolytic therapy of earliest possibility. Door-to-puncture (DPT) time was defined

78

as the duration from hospital arrival to groin puncture for mechanical thrombectomy.

79

For those who did not meet the criteria of mechanical thrombectomy, DPT was based

80

on a presumed mechanical thrombectomy of earliest possibility. Potential influencing

81

factors for treatment delay, such as residency, means of transportation and level of the

82

first visited hospital, were retrieved and analyzed. The severity of stroke was

83

measured with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). In this study, we

84

choose a 4.5 hours as the cut point for defining delayed treatment because that 4.5

85

hours is the accepted deadline for rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis at present [1].

86

Statistical Analysis

87

Continuous variables were expressed as mean± standard deviation (SD) or median

88

and interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as

89

frequency and percentage. Continuous variables with normal distribution were

90

compared using the Student’s t-test. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used

91

for comparing categorical values. Multiple-variable stepwise logistic regression was

92

used to determine the main influencing factors of treatment delay. A two sided P

93

value of <0.05 was deemed as statistical significance. All statistical analyses were

94

performed using SPSS 25.

Results

96

A total of 267 patients were included during the described time frames, of which 161

97

(60.3%) were arrived before and 106 (39.7%) after the COVID-19 pandemic. The

98

mean age of the included patients was 69.1± 11.3 years, and 167 (62.5%) of them

99

were male. The median (IQR) NIHSS score at admission was 6 (3–13) in the

100

Pre-COVID-19 group and 8 (5–16) in the Post-COVID-19 group (P=0.040). However,

101

no significant differences concerning age, sex, residence, education level, stroke

102

subtypes and comorbidities were detected between patients arrived before and after

103

the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1).

104

The ODT, a proxy of pre-hospital delay, was significantly longer in post- than

105

pre-COVID-19 pandemic patients (317 [IQR 65-790] vs 202 [IQR 25-492] min;

106

P=0.010).The decision time for patients after the COVID-19 pandemic was

107

significantly longer than that of those before COVID-19 pandemic (129 [IQR 55-430]

108

vs 244 [IQR 80-710] min, P<0.001). Time used for transportation was similar

109

between patients before and after the COVID-19 pandemic (67 [IQR 33-88] vs 73

110

[IQR 31-93] min; P=0.316). DNT was prolonged significantly after the

111

implementation of anti-pandemic strategies (65 [IQR 48-84] vs 50 [IQR 40-75] min,

112

P=0.048). The proportion of patients from onset to treatment within 4.5 hours was

113

significantly decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic (29.0% vs 34.8%, P=0.032).

114

The proportion of patients with intravenous thrombolysis in those with acute ischemic

115

stroke was decreased significantly after the pandemic (15.4% vs 20.1%; P=0.030).

116

While the proportion of patients with mechanical thrombectomy in those with acute

117

ischemic stroke remained unchanged (12.1% vs 15.7%, P=0.115, Table 1).

118

When compared with patients who arrived hospital within 4.5 hours (ONT ≤

119

4.5 hours), those who arrived hospital latter (ONT >4.5h) had lower education level

(elementary education: 18.4% vs 37.2%, P=0.018), more likely lived in rural areas

121

(26.4% vs 33.9%, P=0.044), less likely had hemorrhagic stroke (18.4% vs 14.4%,

122

P=0.041), had lower NIHSS scores (8 vs 3, P=0.031), less likely transferred by EMS

123

(43.7% vs 16.1%, P<0.001), more likely had self-management after stroke onset (9.2%

124

vs 87.8%, P<0.001), and more likely had stroke after the COVID-19 pandemic (27.6%

125

vs 45.6%, P=0.031, Table 2).

126

Table 3 presents the potential influencing factors for delayed treatment

127

(ONT>4.5h) by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Compared with patients

128

before COVID-19 pandemic, patients after COVID-19 pandemic had an OR of 1.52

129

(95% CI, 1.02–2.94) for treatment delay. Compared with patients with advanced

130

education, those with elementary education had an odds of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.08–2.31)

131

for treatment delay. Compared with patients living in urban, those living in rural area

132

had an odds of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.01–1.42) for treatment delay. Patients who firstly

133

chose to self-manage stroke after onset had an OR of 2.03 (95% CI, 1.40–3.76) for

134

treatment delay. Patients transported by EMS had an OR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68–0.86)

135

for treatment delay. Patients with baseline NIHSS >10 had an OR of 0.64 (95% CI,

136

0.45–0.89) for treatment delay.

Discussion

138

The current study highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment delay in

139

patients with acute stroke. ODT and DTN were significantly prolonged, and

140

proportion of patients arrived within the time window for intravenous thrombolysis

141

was significantly decreased after COVID pandemic.

142

During COVID-19, patients may be reluctant to seek medical help for fear of

143

being infected. Patients with mild symptoms may stay at home and managing stroke

144

be themselves or their relatives. This speculation was partly confirmed by the higher

145

NIHSS score in post-COVID-19. A similar pattern of delay in seeking medical care

146

due to fear of being infected within the hospitals was observed in the Ebola epidemic

147

in West Africa [6].

148

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the onset to needle time was significantly

149

prolonged than before. Traffic control during the pandemic may delay the patient

150

transportation. Social distance may influence the management of stroke patients.

151

Procedures for COVID-19 prevention, such as information inquiring concerning

152

travel and contact history, temperature measuring, chest X-ray or CT scanning,

153

coronavirus nucleic acid or antibody testing, blood cell counting, and

154

multidisciplinary consultation may all delay the management of stroke. On the other

155

hand, medical staff may need more time to wear protective devices before they could

156

manage stroke patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

157

This study associated higher NIHSS score with shorter pre-hospital delay. This

158

is consistent with some previous studies [7, 8], but not with others [9]. Patients with

159

severe symptoms may be more obvious to be identified, but severe symptoms may

160

render patients from seeking for help when alone. Transferred with ambulance was

161

associated with shorter pre-hospital delay [10-13]. Early awareness of stroke onset

162

and rapid response are crucial to shorten the treatment delay [14, 15]. Previous studies

163

[16] indicated that major factors for pre-hospital delay included unawareness of stroke

164

symptoms, lack of understanding on importance of early response, and lack of

165

knowledge on early management. Previous studies demonstrated that only 15.6% of

166

respondents knew stroke warning signs [17]. A large proportion of respondents think

167

that stroke symptoms may not warrant emergent management [18].

168

Several limitations should be addressed when interpreting the results of current

169

study. Firstly, patients were enrolled outside the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic in

170

China, which may have under-estimated the impacts of the pandemic on stroke

171

management. Secondly, with the accumulation of coping experiences, the impacts of

172

COVID-19 pandemic on stroke management may be relieved. Finally, although the

173

impacts of COVID-19 on intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy

174

were analyzed, the impacts on stroke outcomes (e.g. 90-day modified Rankin Scale)

175

were not analyzed.

176

In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic has a remarkable influence on the

177

management of acute ischemic stroke. Both pre- and post-hospital delays were

178

prolonged significantly, and proportion of patient arrived within the 4.5-hour time

179

window for intravenous thrombolysis treatment was decreased. Given that

180

anti-COVID-19 measures are becoming medical routines, efforts are warranted to

181

shorten the delay so that stroke outcome could be improved in this complex time.
