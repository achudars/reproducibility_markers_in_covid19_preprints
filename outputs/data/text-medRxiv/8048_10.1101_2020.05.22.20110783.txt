Abstract
COVID-19 is a global epidemic. Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic.
However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective to control this
pandemic. In this paper, we provide an analytical model on the effectiveness of the
sustainable lockdown policy that accommodates both isolation and social distancing
features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we analyze a noncooperative
game environment that provides an incentive for maintaining social distancing.
Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is also interpreted with the help
of a game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing. Finally, an
extensive numerical analysis is provided to study the impact of maintaining a
social-distancing measure to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Numerical results show
that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of
home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results
also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual
incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.

Introduction

The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) is one of the most dangerous
pandemics of this century. COVID-19 has already affected every aspect of individual’s
life i.e. politics, sovereignty, economy, education, religion, entertainment, sports, tourism,
transportation, and manufacturing. It was first identified in Wuhan City, China on
December 29, 2019, and after a short span of time, it broke out worldwide [1, 2]. The
World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public

Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and identified it as an epidemic
on January 30, 2020 [3]. COVID-19 has affected 210 countries and territories
throughout the globe and 2 international conveyances [4, 6] till April 20, 2020.
COVID-19 was first exposed to Wuhan, China massively, and, then, it spread to
other areas of China, and later to other parts of the planet. Until 20 April 2020,
COVID-19 has affected more than 2, 415, 370 persons [3–6] and has become the most
critical global affair. Meanwhile, the total number of death and recovery to/from
COVID-19 are 165, 903 and 632, 484, respectively till April 20, 2020 [3–6]. Different
countries are undertaking different initiatives to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic,
but there is no clear-cut solution to date. Among the worldwide recovery of 632, 484
humans from COVID-19, only China reported 77, 062 recovery cases [3–6]. So far, the
recovery cases against the infected cases are not satisfactory globally anyway.
One of the most crucial tasks that countries need to do for understanding and
preventing the spread of COVID-19 is testing. Testing allows infected bodies to
acknowledge that they are already affected. This can be helpful for taking care of them,
and also to decrease the possibility of contaminating others. Testing is also essential for
a proper reply to the pandemic. It allows carrying evidence-based steps to slow down
the spread of COVID-19. However, to date, the testing capability for COVID-19 is quite
inadequate in most countries around the world. South Korea was the second COVID-19
infectious country after China during February 2020. However, mass testing may be one
of the reasons why it succeeded to diminish the number of new infections since it
facilitates a rapid identification of potential outbreaks [8]. For detecting COVID-19, two
kinds of tests are clinically carried out: (i) detection of virus particles in swabs collected
from the mouth or nose and (ii) estimates the antibody response to the virus in blood
serum.
This COVID-19 epidemic is still uncontrolled in most countries. Infected cases and
death graph are rising every day. However, researchers are also focusing on the
learning-based mechanism for detecting COVID-19 infections [16–22]. This approach
can be cost-effective and also possibly will take less time to perform the test. Other
studies [9–14] focus on analyzing the epidemiological and/or clinical characteristics of
COVID-19. As per our knowledge, there is no study that focuses on mathematical
model is for monitoring and controlling individual to prevent this COVID-19 epidemic.
Thus, the main contribution of this paper is to develop an effective mathematical model
with the help of global positioning system (GPS) information to fight against
COVID-19 epidemic by monitoring and controlling individual. To this end, we make the
following key contributions:
 First, we study the real-world dataset to realize the worldwide severity of
COVID-19 epidemic and also show the predicted results for infected and active
cases of COVID-19.
 Second, we consider an optimization problem that maximizes the social utility of
individuals by taking into account isolation and social distancing policies. Here,
the optimization parameters are the positions of an individual.
 Third, we analyze the objective function by incorporating the social distancing
feature of an individual in a noncooperative game environment. Here, we observe
that home isolation is the dominant strategy for all the players of the game.
 Finally, we interpret the sustainability of lockdown policy for controlling the
impact of COVID-19 outbreak through extensive numerical analysis.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The global phenomenon of
COVID-19 is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the literature review. We

the rate increases initially due to China but the number of infected cases are not too
high. However, the infected rate again increases after the second week of March, 2020
because of spreading COVID-19 globally specially in Europe, USA and Iran.
The number of human loss due to COVID-19 and also the recovered cases from
COVID-19 continue to increasing throughout the time as shown in Fig. 1. The human
loss due to COVID-19 is frightening in numerous countries, like USA, Italy, Spain,
France, UK. The percentages of human loss for COVID-19 of top 10 countries over all
the loss of the globe is shown in Fig. 4. However, only three countries namely USA,
Italy and Spain contribute ore than 50% of COVID-19 deaths as presented in Fig. 4.
Fig. 5 shows the gaps among infected, death, and recovery cases (COVID-19) for 10

significant. Moreover, the death cases surpasses recovered cases for UK among these 10
countries. Fig. 6 shows the death and recovered percentages with respect to infected
cases for top 10 COVID-19 infected countries to get inside the scenario. Though the
average death case is 7% for these countries due to COVID-19, the ratios are
significantly high for Italy, UK, France, Spain. However, despite limited knowledge
regarding COVID-19, different countries are trying their best to fight against this
pandemic. Fig. 6 also exhibits that the recovery cases from COVID-19 are satisfactory
in China (93.14%), Iran (69.36%) and Germany (61.10%) only, other countries are still
straggling to find the right ways. By the way, the average recovered rate is only 34% for
these countries till now. The demographic information of the infected and death cases
are presented in Fig. 7, 8, and 9. Fig. 7 shows the percentage of COVID-19 infected
cases by sex based on [32] and infection among females are more. However, the death
percentage for COVID-19 is more for male than female as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 9 shows
the percentages of infected and death cases among different age groups based upon [32].
The figure depicts that the infection cases are higher for ages from 21 to 70. The main
cause of the characteristics is that these groups are working class and come contact with
many peoples. However, the death cases are higher for ages above 60 years as shown in
Fig. 9. The main cause is the weak immune system for older peoples.

Literature Review

COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus identified to contaminate humans. Individuals
were first affected by the 2019-nCoV virus from bats and other animals that were sold
at the seafood market in Wuhan [15, 24]. Afterward, it began to spread from human to
human mainly through respiratory droplets produced while people sneeze cough or
exhaling [3]. Epidemiological and/or clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are analyzed
in the studies [9–14].
In [9], the authors investigate the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics based on
91 cases of COVID-19 patients of Zhejiang, China. Among these samples, 96.70% were
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3.30% were
clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The average age of the patients was 50 while
females accounted for 59.34%. The typical indications were fever (71.43%), cough
(60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). 43.96%o these patients were affected from local cases,
34.07% went to or were in Wuhan/Hubei, 8.79% came in contact with peoples from
Wuhan, and 12.09% were from aircraft transmission. The authors represent a detailed
statistical analysis of 1, 212 individuals collected from January 21 to February 14, 2020,
and covering 18 regions of the Henan province, China [10]. Among these cases, 55%
were male and ages of these patients were from 21 to 60 years. Among these patients,
20.63% had Wuhan’s travel history. In [11], the authors investigate epidemiological,
demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data for 99 cases of
2019-nCoV collected from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. They found that 49% of
these patients traveled to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the victims
was 55.5 years, and most of them (67.68%) were men. The main clinical manifestations
were fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath (31%). Among the sufferers, 75%
exhibited bilateral pneumonia also. The work in [12] analyzes the clinical characteristics
of 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31

provinces/provincial municipalities of Wuhan, China. This work concluded that the
median age of these patients was 47 years where 41.90% of them were female. The most
common symptoms of these patients were fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%). Most of
these cases had a Wuhan connection (31.30% had been to Wuhan, and 71.80% had
contacted people from Wuhan). Epidemiological investigations were conducted in [13]
among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing,
Jiangsu Province, China. Among them, 33.3% recently traveled Hubei and the average
age of these cases was 32.5 years including 33.3% male. 20.8% of these patients showed
fever, cough, fatigue symptoms during hospitalization whereas 50.0% cases showed
typical CT images of the ground-glass chest and 20.8% presented stripe shadowing in
the lungs. The study in [14] estimates the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy
and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. The age
range of the subjects was 26–40 years and everybody of them had laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 pneumonia. They showed a similar pattern of clinical characteristics to
non-pregnant adult patients. The authors mainly found that no intrauterine fetal
infections occurred as a result of COVID-19 infection during a late stage of pregnancy.
Machine learning can play an important role to detect COVID-19 infected people
based on the observatory data. The work in [16] proposes an algorithm to investigate
the readings from the smartphone’s sensors to find the COVID 19 symptoms of a
patient. Some commons symptoms of COVID-19 victims like fever, fatigue, headache,
nausea, dry cough, lung CT imaging features, and shortness of breath can be captured
by using the smartphone. This detection approach for COVID-19 is faster than the
clinical diagnosis methods. The authors in [17] propose an artificial intelligence (AI)
framework for obtaining the travel history of people using a phone-based survey to
classify them as no-risk, minimal-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk of being affected
with COVID-19. The model needs to be trained with the COVID-19 infected
information of the areas where s/he visited to accurately predict the risk level of
COVID-19. In [18], the authors develop a deep learning-based method (COVNet) to
identify COVID -19 from the volumetric chest CT image. For measuring the accuracy of
their system, they utilize community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other
non-pneumonia CT images. The authors in [19] also use deep learning techniques for
distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy
cases based on the pulmonary CT images. They use a location-attention classification
model to categorize the images into the above three groups. Depth cameras and deep
learning are applied to recognize unusual respiratory pattern of personnel remotely and
accurately in [20]. They propose a novel and effective respiratory simulation model
based on the characteristics of original respiratory signals. This model intends to fill the
gap between large training datasets and infrequent real-world data. Multiple
retrospective experiments were demonstrated to examine the performance of the system
in the detection of speculated COVID-19 thoracic CT characteristics in [21]. A 3D
volume review, namely “Corona score” is employed to assess the evolution of the disease
in each victim over time. In [22], the authors use a pre-trained UNet to fragment the
lung region for automatic detection of COVID-19 from a chest CT image. Afterward,
they use a 3D deep neural network to estimate the probability of COVID-19 infections
over the segmented 3D lung region. Their algorithm uses 499 CT volumes as a training
dataset and 131 CT volumes as a test dataset and achieves 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976
PR AUC. The study in [23] presents evidence of the diversity of human coronavirus, the
rapid evolution of COVID-19, and their clinical and Epidemiological characteristics.
The authors also develop a deep learning model for identifying COVID-19. and trained
the model using a small CT image datasets. They find an accuracy of around 90% using
a small CT image dataset.

phenomenon of the COVID-19 outbreak by applying a new model to quantify the
effectiveness of association tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. In their model, they
analyze synopses with a varying number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number,
the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced,
the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom start, and the proportion
of subclinical infections. They find that contact tracing and case isolation are capable
enough to restrain a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. In [37], the author
points out some of the features of COVID-19 pandemic with the help of Prisoner’s
dilemma. However, the work in [37] does not provide any concrete utility functions for
the studied game.
The works [9–14, 16–22] focused on COVID-19 detection and analyzed the
characteristic of its respiratory pattern. Hence, the literature has achieved a significant
result in terms of post responses. In fact, it is also imperative to control the epidemic of
COVID-19 by maintaining social distance. Therefore, different from the existing
literature, we focus on the design of a model that can measure individual’s isolation and
social distance to prevent the epidemic of COVID-19. The model considers both
isolation and social distancing features of individuals to control the outbreak of
COVID-19.

Consider an area in which a set N of N individuals are living under COVID-19 threat
and must decide whether to stay at home or go leave their homes to visit a market,
shop, train station, or other locations, as shown in Fig. 12. Everyone has a mobile
phone with GPS. From analyzing the GPS information, we can know their home
locations of each individuals, and longitude and latitude of these locations are denoted

our scenario and this time period is divided into T smaller time steps in a set T . For
each of time step t ∈ T , we have the GPS coordinates X and Y of every individual.
Now, the deviation from home for any individual i ∈ N in between two time steps
can be measured by using Euclidean distance as follows:

Our objective is to keep δ minimum for reducing the spread of COVID-19 from

social distancing which mathematically translates into maximizing d for reducing the
chance of infection from others. However, we can use log term to bring fairness [26, 29]
in the objective function among all individuals. Hence, we can pose the following

vast population in the society. Constraint (7a) guarantees small deviation to maintain
emergency needs, while Constraint (7b) assures a minimum fair distance among all the
individuals to reduce the spreading of COVID-19 from one individual to another.
Constraint (7c) shows that ω can take any value between 0 and 1 which captures the
importance between two key factors captured in the objective function of (7). For
example, if COVID-19 is already spreading in a given society, then most of the weight
would go to isolation term rather than social distancing. The objective of (7) is difficult
to achieve as it requires the involvement and coordination among all the N individual.
Moreover, if the individuals are not convinced then it is also difficult for the government
to attain the objective forcefully. Thus, we need an alternative solution approach that
encourage individual separately to achieve the objective and game theory, which is
successfully used in [27, 28], can be one potential solution, which will be elaborated in
the next section.

A Noncooperative Game Analysis for Achieving
Social Objective

To attain the objective for a vast population, governments can introduce incentives for
isolation and also for social distancing. Then every individual wants to maximize their
utilities or payoffs. In this way, government can play its role for achieving social
objective. Hence, the modified objective function is given as follows:

where α = α ω and β = β (1 − ω) with α > 0 and β > 0 are incentives per unit of
isolation and social distancing. In (8), one individual’s position affects the social
distancing of others, and hence, the individuals have partially conflicting interest on the
outcome of U . Therefore, the situation can be explained with the noncooperative
game [35, 36].
A noncooperative game is a game exhibiting a competitive situation where each
player needs to make it’s choice independent of the other players, given the possible
policies of the other players and their impact on the player’s payoffs or utilities. Now, a
noncooperative game in strategic form or a strategic game G is a triplet
G = (N , (Si )i∈N , (ui )i∈N ) [30] for any time period where:

In our case Si = {shi , sm

and moving outside for player i ∈ N , respectively. The payoff or incentive function of
any player i ∈ N in a time period can be defined as follows:
(

where d˜i = j∈Ni (Xih − Xj )2 + (Yih − Yj )2 .
The Nash equilibrium [31] is the most used solution concept for a noncooperative
game. Formally, Nash equilibrium can be defined as follows [34]:

Definition 1. : A pure strategy Nash equilibrium for a non-cooperative game
G = (N , (Si )i∈N , (ui )i∈N ) is a strategy profile s∗ ∈ S where
ui (s∗i , s∗−i ) ≥ ui (si , s∗−i ), ∀si ∈ Si , ∀i ∈ N .

278

However, to find the Nash equilibrium, the following two definitions can be helpful.

Definition 2. [30]: A strategy si ∈ Si is the dominant strategy
Q for player i ∈ N if

0
ui (si , s−i ) ≥ ui (si , s−i ), ∀si ∈ S and ∀s−i ∈ S−i , where S−i = j∈N ,j6=i Sj is the set of
all strategy profiles for all players except i.

283

Definition 3. [30]: A strategy profile s∗ ∈ S is the dominant strategy equilibrium if
every elements s∗i of s∗ is the dominant strategy of player i ∈ N .
Thus, if we can show that every player of our game G has a strategy that gives
better utility irrespective of other players strategies, then with the help of Definition 2
and 3. Our game exhibits the structure of an N-player Prisoner’s dilemma, so based
on [30] it will have a unique Nash equilibrium.
Thus, Nash equilibrium is the solution of the noncooperative game G. In this
equilibrium, no player of N has the benefit of changing their strategy while others
remain in their strategies. That means, the utility of each player i ∈ S is maximized in
this strategy, and hence ultimately maximize the utility of (8). To this end, maximizing
U of (8) ultimately maximize the original objective function of (7).

where R0 is the initial resource of a particular country starting of the lockdown policy
and rp is the collected resources in a particular day, p, of the lockdown period. Here, rp
includes governmental revenue, donation from different individuals, organizations and
even countries. Moreover, the unit of α, β, R0 and rp are same.
If we assume for simplicity that Up and rp are same for every day and they are
denoted by Ũ and r̃, respectively, then we can rewrite (12) as follows:
P × Ũ ≤ R0 + P × r̃.

Here, the sustainable days P depends on R0 , Ũ , and r̃. However, we cannot change
R0 but government can predict r̃. Moreover, depending on R0 and r̃, government can
formulate its policy to set α and β so that individuals are encouraged to follow the
lockdown policy. Alongside, we cannot continue lockdown policy infinitely based upon
the limited total resources. Hence, the governments should formulate and update its
lockdown policy based on the predicted sustainable capability to handle COVID-19,
otherwise resource crisis will be a further bigger pandemic in the world.

cases whereas the incentives are 90% sure in between 20, 500 and 21, 000 for 75% home
isolation case. Moreover, the same values are at least 21, 500 for 50% sure in case of full
home isolation. Fig. 15 depicts that the incentive of being below 38, 000 is 40% sure for
25% home isolation case, however, the same values of being above 40, 000, and 41, 000
are 40%, and 60%, sure, respective, for 50%, and 75% cases. Moreover, for 100% home
isolation case, the values are in between 42, 000 to 43, 000 for sure. The incentives for
25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% home isolation cases are above 57, 000, 59, 000, 61, 000, and
63, 000, respectively, with probability 0.60, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.80, respectively, as shown in

with 0.50, 0.50, 0.72, and 1.00 probabilities, respectively, which is presented in Fig. 17.
The total incentive (averaging of 50 runs) for varying percentage of home isolation
individuals with different sample size are shown in Fig. 18. From this figure, we observe
that the total payoff increases with increasing number of home isolation individuals for
all considered cases. The incentives are 578%, 571%, 571%, and 571% better from home
quarantine of 25% to 100% for N = 500, N = 1, 000, N = 1, 500, and N = 2, 000,
respectively. Moreover, for a particular percentage of home isolation, the total incentive
is related with the sample size. In case of 50% individuals in the home isolation, the
incentive for N = 2, 000 is 97.08%, 42.50%, and 15.96% more than that of N = 500,
N = 1, 000, and N = 1, 500, respectively. Fig. 19 shows the average individual payoff
for varying parentage of home isolation individuals for different scenarios. The figure
exhibits that the average individual incentive increases with an increasing percentage of
home isolation as the deviation δ decreases and hence, the value of home isolation
incentive increases. For N = 500, the incentive of 100% home isolation is 85.25% more
than that of 25% home isolation. Moreover, in a particular percentage of home isolation,

the incentive decreases with an increasing number of considered individuals as the social
distancing decreases due to the more number of individuals. In case of 50% home
isolation, the individual incentive for N = 500 is 102.96% more than that of N = 2, 000.
Fig. 20 shows the maximum possible lockdown period for a varying number of
individuals within a fixed amount of resource R0 . The figure reveals that with the
increasing percentage of home isolation individuals, the maximum lockdown period
significantly decreases for all considered cases. The reason behind this is that the more
individuals are in home isolation, the more it is necessary to pay the incentives. With a
fixed amount of resources, a country with less individuals can survive a longer lockdown
period. With more percentages of home isolation individuals, the number of loackdown
period is less, and possible of spreading of COVID-19 is also less. Therefore, the
governments can consider a trade-off between increasing expenditure as a incentive and
lockdown period. For 1, 000 individuals, the maximum possible lockdown period for
varying amount of R0 and r̃ is presented in Fig. 21. The figure also illustrates that with
the increasing percentages of home isolation individuals, the continuity of the lockdown
period reduces for every scenarios. However, for a particular percentage of home
isolation individuals where total number of individuals are fixed, a country can continue
higher lockdown period who has more am amount of resources, R0 . Additionally, r̃ also
play an important role to continue the lockdown period.

In this paper, we have studied an analytical model for controlling the outbreak of
COVID-19 by augmenting isolation and social distancing features of individuals. Here,
we have observed that staying home (home isolation) is the best strategy of every
individual and there is a Nash equilibrium of the noncooperative game. We have also
analyzed the sustainability period of a country with a lockdown policy. Finally, we have

performed a detailed numerical analysis of the proposed model to control the outbreak
of the COVID-19. In future, we will further study and compare with extended cases
such as centralized and different game-theoretic models. In particular, an extensive
analysis between the government-controlled spread or people controlled spread under
more diverse epidemic models.
