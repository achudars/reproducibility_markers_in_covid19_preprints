ABSTRACT
Objective: Though the speed of policy interventions is critical in responding to a fast spreading pandemic,
there is little research on this topic. This study aims to (1) review the state of research on the topic (2)
compile an original dataset of 87 COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions across 17 countries and (3)
analyses the timing of COVID-19 policy interventions on mortality rates of individual countries.
Design: Statistical analysis using Excel and R language version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28) of 1479 nonpharmaceutical policy interventions data points.
Setting: China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Germany, Canada, India, United Arab Emirates,
United States of America, South Africa, Egypt, Jordan, France, Iran, United Kingdom and Italy.
Population: 36 health policies, 19 fiscal policies; 8 innovation policies; 19 social distancing policies, and 5
travel policies – related to COVID-19.
Interventions: We calculate the time (time-lag) between the start date of a policy and three-time specific
events: the first reported case in Wuhan, China; the first nationally reported disease case; the first nationally
reported death.
Main Outcome Measures: National level mortality rates across 17 countries. Mortality rate is equivalent to
(death attributed to COVID-19) / (death attributed to COVID-19 + COVID-19 recovered cases).
Results: The literature review found 22 studies that looked at policy and timing with respect to mortality
rates. Only four were multicountry, multi-policy studies. Based on the analysis of the database, we find no
significant direction of the association (positive or negative) between the time lag from the three specified
points and mortality rates. The standard deviation (SD) of policy lags was of the same order of magnitude as
the mean of lags (30.57 and 30.22 respectively), indicating that there is no consensus among countries on
the optimal time lags to implement a given policy. At the country level, the average time lag to implement a
policy decreased the longer the time duration between the country's first case and the Wuhan first case,
indicating countries got faster to implement policies as more time passed.
Conclusions: The timing of policy interventions across countries relative to the first Wuhan case, first
national disease case, or first national death, is not found to be correlated with mortality. No correlation
between country quickness of policy intervention and country mortality was found. Countries became
quicker in implementing policies as time passed. However, no correlation between country quickness of
policy intervention and country mortality was found. Policy interventions across countries relative to the
first recorded case in each country, is not found to be correlated with mortality for 86 of the 87 policies. At
the country level we find that no correlation was found between country-average delays in implementing
policies and country mortality. Further there is no correlation with higher country rankings in The Global
Health Security Index and policy timing and mortality rates.

INTRODUCTION
With regard to policymaking during a pandemic, there are several assumptions being made. First, there is an
assumption being made that early policy interventions would lower transmission rates and mortality rates.1 2
3
However, this generally accepted view of the relevance and importance of timing of policy interventions
from past epidemics is supported by very few studies. 4 5 6 The World Health Organization Writing Group
stresses that pandemic interventions are often based on limited information and vary depending on the
context.7 There are competing concerns that countries need to manage, and these may be influenced by
internal events (elections) or external events (global reputation).8 9
Often the urgency of policy interventions focuses on one of two effects – saving lives and staunching the
effects of the disease on the economy.10 11 12 Existing studies of COVID-19 policy interventions look at
policies in isolation like travel restrictions,13 contact tracing,14 proactive testing,15 isolation, and social
distancing,16 lockdowns,17 18 or school closure.19 Single policy studies may not accurately reflect the
complexity of the situation (health, economy, societal concerns, for example). The World Health
Organization recommends whole-of-society coordination mechanisms to support preparedness and
response, including the health, transport, travel, trade, finance, security and other sectors”.20 A recent study
on the timing for social distancing, in Wuhan (Hubei, China), South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
and Italy between January and March 2020 finds that the implementation of the social distancing policy was
random.21 There are few multi-policy studies available.
In a majority of cases,where those studies exist, they examine policy implementation in a single country and
assume the findings are transferable across borders.22 23 Few multi-country, multi-policy studies exist. We
found one study24 that looked at 17 policies, but all focused on various types of social distancing measures.
The countries studies were China (Wuhan), South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Italy. The
study finds that the information available was sparse and based on what they collected, they state that it is
difficult to quantitatively assess the efficacy of many interventions, though they do conclude that social
distancing slows the spread of the disease. On the other hand, a muti-country, multi-policy study covering
China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States, focusing on travel restrictions, social
distancing through cancellations of events, suspensions of educational/commercial/religious activities,
quarantines, lockdowns, state of emergency declarations, and expansions of paid sick leave, found that
policies slow COVID-19 virus contagion as measured by cases and deaths.25
Some studies have cautioned against applying learnings from previous pandemics to the present one, and
stress that more data is needed on interventions and their impact in individual countries.26 27 Due to the
relatively little research across countries and the robustness of findings on the timing of policy interventions
and mortality, this study aims to evaluate the timing of policy intervention and their correlation to mortality
rates. This research will (1) conduct a systematic review of COVID-19 papers that study the impact of the
timing of the policies intervention on mortality rates (2) compile a dataset of COVID-19 policy interventions
across 17 countries (3) evaluate the correlation of the quickness of a country-level policy intervention on
country mortality rate and (4) evaluate given policy across countries, to assess if there is a correlation
between quickness and mortality rate.

METHODS
We conducted a systematic review of studies on the impact of timing of policy intervention on mortality
rates during the COVID-19 period. The search was limited to COVID-19 policies and interventions
published in the English language for articles indexed in PubMed and Proquest that were published between
January 2020 and May 2020. The keywords included: COVID-19 ‘timing of policy’, ‘non-pharmaceutical
interventions, epidemics/pandemics, health crisis, outbreaks, on mortality rates.

To create the dataset, we identified 87 COVID-19 policy interventions across 17 countries, daily COVID-19
cases, and mortality rates. The start date is from December 31 2019, and the end date is May 16 2020. The
data collection was conducted between April 6 2020, and June 4 2020. The start dates of 87 policy
interventions were collected using various sources such as OxCGRT,28 data from Institute Montaigne,
government websites, research papers, press releases, press conferences, and newspaper reports. In many
cases, the start date of the policy is not explicitly given. We use the date of the first announcement of the
policy. Once the start date was determined, the lag in days between the start date and (1) the first case in
Wuhan (2) first case in the country and (3) the first confirmed death in the given country was then
calculated. The assumption we make is that the policy is deployed in response to the local COVID-19
situation.29
Deaths and cases were compiled using daily reports from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control. We decided to use the mortality rate to compare countries as it is a more robust measure of the
pandemic outcomes. We define mortality rate as (death attributed to COVID-19) / (deaths + recovered
cases).30
The 17 countries chosen for analysis are among the first affected countries and are identified as having
medium to high rankings on the 2019 Global Health Security Index (see Table 1). Three critical events
happened during the time the sample countries had their first infection: Wuhan Lockdown (3 countries),
Chinese New Year (which was a significant milestone for transmission of the disease)31 and WHO
declaration of Public Health Emergency (6 countries), and WHO declaration of pandemic (8 countries). All
these events could be considered as early warning signals for governments to plan policy interventions
(Appendix 1). The countries are representative of three continents Asia, Europe, and North America.
Table 1 presents a ranking of countries ranked as ‘most prepared’, ‘more prepared’, and ‘least prepared’
from the Global Health Security Index 201932 and the Worldometer COVID-19 Mortality Ranking as of

ANALYSIS
The review identified 142 relevant studies focusing on COVID-19 related non-pharmaceutical intervention
(NPI) policies. After screening by abstract/title, 28 studies were selected for full-text assessment. Of them,
22 were finally selected (see Appendix 2). The majority of the studies focused on a single country (n=18) or
a small group of countries (n=4) with similar policy interventions (for example, school closure (n=8). China
was the most studied country (37%, n=8), followed by the USA (27%, n=6), then Iran (1), Canada (1),
Lebanon (1), and Taiwan (1). There were four multiple country studies: West Africa as a region, a global
study on YouTube videos with no specific country identified; one looking at China, Iran, Japan, Italy, and
South Korea; and a two-country study looking at Spain and the UK. The study period for these studies was
from December 2019 to May 2020. The majority of studies used a quantitative research design (n=19),
where the main focus was on timely and accurate dissemination of policies in terms of managing during
pandemics.
Though these studies used the word timing, they did not investigate the impact of the timing of the policy
intervention on mortality rates during the COVID-19 period. Instead, these studies looked at which public
policy measures and interventions were critical in limiting the spread of COVID-19 over a particular time
period.34 35 36 37 One study suggested that policymakers could have the best chance for policy learning due to
the time lag between the China outbreak COVID-19 and the spread in the context of Iran.38 The papers have
highlighted the need for the importance of delivering timely and accurate information.39 40 41 42 43

Our original dataset analysis was at two levels: looking at time lags at the country-level and the policy-level.
We treat time lags in a similar way, as previously done in a big data modeling application.44 The time lag
between policy implementation and a COVID-19 milestone was defined as the number of days between the
policy start date and the given milestone date. We run statistical models for three different milestones: (i) the
first case confirmed in the country, (ii) the first death in the country and, (iii) the date of the first case in
Wuhan, China, and their correlation to COVID-19 mortality rates. The effectiveness and degree of
enforcement have not been evaluated here, as there can be variance in implementation across geographical
regions within a country, particularly in large federal governance structures, autonomous regions, and so
forth. Hence, each policy time lag is relative to one global event (China first case) and two country-specific
milestones.
At the policy level, to assess the linear association and direction between country mortality and policy time
lag, we used the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. However, both Spearman and Pearson yielded
similar results for the three different milestones considered. Table 2 shows a matrix of time lags (each cell is
a time lag) where rows are the 87 policies and columns are the 17 countries. Each cell indicates the distance
in days between the first confirmed case and the start of the policy in each given country. A negative figure
indicates how many days before the first confirmed case, the policy was implemented. A positive number
shows how many days the policy was implemented after the first confirmed case. A blank indicates that
there is no data available because the policy was either never implemented in the given country or
information is not available.
For each policy, we calculate the correlation with country-specific indicators such as mortality rate, which is
equivalent to (death attributed to COVID-19) / (death attributed to COVID-19 + COVID-19 recovered
cases). We choose this indicator because it reflects how effectively the country is coping. Then we compute
the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, confidence intervals, and p-values. For reference, we also
computed Pearson coefficients. The same analysis, mentioned above, was conducted with different COVID19 curve milestones (Nth death, Mth case). The results are similar and provided in the appendix. A dynamic
Excel sheet is also provided where N and M are parameters that can be modified, and the Pearson and
Spearman coefficients are re-calculated on the go. The analysis was conducted both in Excel and R language
(version 3.4.2 2017-09-28). The Spearman p-values were computed both in Excel and in R using the
SpearmanCI package. Slight differences (+/-5%) in the Spearman coefficient values due to different slight
formulas used by both Excel and SpearmanCI are also noted, and confirm the differences stated previously
by the authors of the SpearmanCI package.45 For 86 policies, no significant correlation was found. Only one
policy was found to be weakly correlated, the policy for isolation of the infected, with a sample size of 12
countries applying the policy, and a Spearman Coefficient =0.63; (95% CI [0.27 - 0.91] p-value 0.03). See
Figure 1.

At the country level, we ran a linear regression to quantify whether countries implement policies quicker as
time lapsed (see Table 3 and Figure 2). In the regression, the days elapsed since each country's reported first
case and the Wuhan first case was the dependent variable. The independent variable is the mean of each
policy time lags for each country. The linear regression yields Multiple R-squared: 0.511, Adjusted Rsquared: 0.476, and a p-value: 0.001. Intercept 45.51, slope – 0.55. For every day elapsed since the Wuhan
first case was reported, countries reduced the average delay to implement a policy relative to their own first
case by half-day approximately. However, no correlation was found between country-average delays in

FINDINGS
No Correlation found between Policy Timing and Mortality Rate
We examined 87 policies across 17 countries. The timing of policy interventions in and across countries
relative to (1) first case in Wuhan, China, (2) first recorded case in each country and (3) first recorded death
in each country, is not found to be correlated with mortality, though we find that countries became quicker
in introducing policy interventions as time passed. This finding supports the recent conclusions of other
researchers46 who state, “countries that have flattened death curves earliest may not provide a basis for
extrapolating trends in areas where similar control could prove elusive.” Interventions likely had
reinforcing effects and were driven by critical behaviour changes within local communities47 and perhaps
existing conditions in public health infrastructure.
No significant direction of the association was found (positive or negative) except for one policy (“Isolation
of only infected”). This policy showed a positive association between the quickness to implement the policy
and mortality (Spearman coefficient +0.61 95% CI [0.27 - 0.91]). Other researchers found that isolating all
positive cases, including the asymptomatic, helped in containing the virus. 48
Policies across countries are not implemented with the same urgency
The SD of policy time lags was of the same order of magnitude as the mean of lags (30.57 and 30.22
respectively), indicating that there is no agreement between countries on what are the optimal times to start a
given policy (see Figure 5). This is surprising as a pandemic requires some coordination across borders. This
was a fast-spreading virus. In our sample, three countries identified their first case from the first case in
China to January, 6 countries between the Wuhan Lockdown and the Chinese New Year/WHO Global alert
(8 days), and another 8 countries between the WHO Global Alert and Pandemic declaration (40 days).
Insert Figure 5: Time-lag of policy concerning the first case across countries
Countries implement policies faster from Wuhan first case
The average time to implement a policy decreased the farther the country's first case was dated from the
Wuhan first case, indicating that countries became quicker in policy responses, which may also indicate that
they also could have become more pre-emptive in policy responses as the pandemic evolved. This finding is
in line with the Oxford policy study that finds internationally, government policy responses have become
more stringent as more time passes.49

No correlation between country ranking and country policy timing implementation
We find no correlation with higher country rankings in The Global Health Security Index and policy timing
and mortality rates. Such indexes do not capture those “other” factors50 51 or help in identifying the factors
that were instrumental in some countries managing the pandemic response better (geographical isolation,
population conformity to mask-wearing). Such country-specific factors can span social,52 environmental,
and political factors53, often requiring behavioral insights,54 not captured in many quantitative models.

DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate there needs to be stronger global coordination across countries and coordination within
countries (federal and local) on policy formulation, timing, and implementation. Our study suggests that the
limited impact of policy timing on mortality may arise if the country does not have the underlying systems,
strategies, and culture in place. While WHO does highlight the importance of multi-sector planning for nonpharmaceutical public health measures,55 the reports for guidance are outdated: the only existing pandemic
report focuses only on influenza is dated 200956; the other relevant reports on infection prevention and
control (IPC) programmes is dated 2019 and the “Managing epidemics” is dated 2018.57
The quality of timely data that needs to be shared within countries and across borders needs to be increased.
One of the challenges of studies like this is understanding the time it takes for a policy to be implemented
and for it to take effect. A policy announcement does not automatically mean that a policy implementation
took place. Two studies found that the announcement of the public health intervention and its subsequent
implementation, showed little evidence of any impact.58 59 At times, the signal that the policy introduction
communicates may provide an illusion of impact (like in monetary policies and stock market reactions).60
CONCLUSION
Top-down policy implementation may not translate as relevant to a bottom-up perspective.61 This could be
the issue of coordination, execution, or the political will not be resonating with communal interests.62
63 64
Policy implementation presupposes collaborative governance – where relevant stakeholders have an
incentive or history of working together towards a common outcome.65 Policy failure can occur as a result of
bad execution, bad policy, or bad luck.66
We suggest future research draw on a more extensive dataset of all country responses, the easing of COVID19 policy responses, and study the reinforcing effects of policies on society. This is because sociodemographic heterogeneity and country policy differences across national borders, interventions may have
different effects. Caution needs to be taken when extrapolating learnings across countries.67
STRENGTHS OF THE STUDY
•
•

This study was an exhaustive policy study that involved manually compiling a policy database of and
1479 policies and case and mortality data for the period between December 31 2019 to May 31 2020.
Visualization of the results allow policy makers to have greater clarity on responsiveness to the
pandemic.

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
•

The term timing has been used fluidly in literature reviews and most studied do not focus on when
the policy was introduced but before and after a policy intervention. In our case the word timing
refers to quickness of response of policy intervention and its impact on mortality.

•
•

Policy implementation dates are based on announcement as there is no clarity on level of
implemntion.
In some cases policy interventions are announced at a city, region or state-level however in that case
we have still assumed it is the first date of implementation in that country.
The findings may change as the sample size increases and as policy interventions ease.
