ABSTRACT

49

Background: To assess the level of knowledge and trust in the policy decisions taken regarding the

50

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic among Epirus Health Study (EHS) participants.

51

Methods: The EHS is an ongoing and deeply-phenotyped prospective cohort study that has recruited 667

52

participants in northwest Greece until August 31st, 2020. Level of knowledge on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-

53

2) transmission and COVID-19 severity was labeled as poor, moderate or good. Variables assessing

54

knowledge and beliefs towards the pandemic were summarized overall and by gender, age group (25-39,

55

40-49, 50-59, ≥60 years) and period of report (before the lifting of lockdown measures in Greece: March

56

30th to May 3rd, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st, July 1st to August 31st). An

57

exposure-wide association analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between 153 explanatory

58

variables and participants’ knowledge. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a false

59

discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%.

60

Results: A total of 563 participants (49 years mean age; 60% women) had available information on the

61

standard EHS questionnaire, the clinical and biochemical measurements, and the COVID-19-related

62

questionnaire. Percentages of poor, moderate and good knowledge status regarding COVID-19 were 4.5%,

63

10.0% and 85.6%, respectively. The majority of participants showed absolute or moderate trust in the Greek

64

health authorities for the management of the epidemic (90.1%), as well as in the Greek Government (84.7%)

65

and the official national sources of information (87.4%). Trust in the authorities was weaker in younger

66

participants and those who joined the study after the lifting of lockdown measures (p-value0.001). None

67

of the factors examined was associated with participants’ level of knowledge after correction for multiple

68

testing.

69

Conclusions: High level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and trust in the Greek authorities

70

was observed, possibly due to the plethora of good quality publicly available information and the timely

71

management of the pandemic at its early stages in Greece. Information campaigns for the COVID-19

72

pandemic should be encouraged even after the lifting of lockdown measures to increase public awareness.

BACKGROUND

98

In December 2019, a cluster of patients suffering from atypical pneumonia was identified in the city of

99

Wuhan, China (1). The outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory

100

Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares pathogenicity characteristics with Severe Acute

101

Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus

102

(MERS-CoV), both responsible for epidemics caused in the 2010s (1,2). The rapid spread of the virus

103

around the globe led to a huge public health crisis and on March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization

104

(WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic (3). Up to August 24th, 2020, more

105

than 20 million cases and 800,000 deaths due to the disease were recorded globally (4).

106

In Greece, the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in late February, 2020 and within a period of one

107

month, 1,212 people were diagnosed with the disease resulting in 46 deaths (5). The Greek Government

108

took immediate action to minimize the spread of the virus by applying a series of public health measures,

109

including the cancellation of local carnivals, closing of schools, universities, gyms, archaeological sites and

110

eventually shopping malls, cafeterias, restaurants, bars and beauty parlors. From March 23 rd to May 4th,

111

2020, a mass lockdown was enforced, whereby citizens could leave their residences only under certain

112

circumstances and after special notification (5).

113

From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large amount of information has been produced with respect

114

to the biological features of the virus and the necessary measures of protection as well as the epidemiology

115

of COVID-19. Human-to-human SARS-CoV-2 transmission is achieved primarily through droplets coming

116

from infected person’s coughing or sneezing that can land directly on the mouth, nose, or eyes of a nearby

117

person or on the surface of objects (6). Most common clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are loss of

118

taste/smell, fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and dyspnea (7). The rates of asymptomatic carriers are unknown

119

with current estimations ranging from 40% to 45% and up to 62% of transmission may occur prior to the

120

onset of symptoms (8,9). Evidence on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic cases exists but

121

relevant details still remain under discussion (10).

122

The need to control transmission necessitates the assessment of awareness, knowledge and adapted

123

practices towards the new pandemic among the general population. Therefore, the primary objective of this

124

study was to investigate the levels of knowledge and beliefs on the COVID-19 pandemic and the magnitude

125

of trust upon Greek authorities and how these measures differed according to age, gender and time period

126

among the participants of an ongoing Greek cohort study, the Epirus Health Study (EHS). We also explored

127

possible factors associated with the population’s knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission and

128

seriousness of COVID-19 in a high-dimensional, agnostic manner to provide guidance for future public

129

health policies tailored to certain population subgroups.

130
131

METHODS

132

Study population

133

The EHS (https://ehs.med.uoi.gr/) was initiated in June 2019 and is an ongoing population-based

134

prospective cohort study, which aims to provide meaningful insight on the complex etiology of

135

multifactorial chronic diseases and contribute to the improvement of the overall health state of the Greek

136

population. The EHS cohort consists of permanent residents of the northwest region of Epirus in Greece,

137

aged 25 to 70 years. Recruitment methods include advertisements to the local press and social media,

138

promotions via study’s website, participation in events organized by local health agencies and invitations

139

to Epirus residents and especially to the staff of companies of the private and public sector. Up to August

140

31st, 2020, a total of 667 subjects agreed to participate.

141

The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Ioannina and is conducted

142

in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provide written informed consent prior to

143

participation in the study.

145

Data collection

146

Socio-demographic characteristics, general health status and lifestyle data

147

All participants were interviewed by two trained interviewers with the use of a standard questionnaire at

148

recruitment. Information was collected regarding i) socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, gender,

149

place of birth, marital status, educational level, employment status and income, ii) general health status,

150

including symptoms of anxiety and depression, iii) personal and family medical history, and iv) lifestyle

151

factors, including physical activity and sedentariness, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, cellphone use,

152

sleep patterns, birth history, reproductive factors in women, cancer screening, medication and dietary

153

supplement use, and dietary behaviors with a special focus on adherence to Mediterranean diet.

154

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with the two leading questions from the General

155

Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (11) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (12), respectively.

156

Adherence to Mediterranean diet was estimated by calculating the 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence

157

Screener (MEDAS), which defines adherence as low (0-6 points) or high (7-14 points) (13). The

158

participants’ sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (14), which ranges

159

from 0 to 21 and the higher the score, the poorer the sleep quality. Participants were classified as non-

160

smokers, former smokers and current smokers according to their self-reported smoking habits. Finally,

161

duration of recreational physical activity was assessed in days per week and minutes per day and then

162

converted to metabolic equivalents of energy expenditure (MET). Each type of activity was assigned to a

163

specific MET score, that is, 3.0 for walking, 6.0 and 9.0 for moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity

164

physical activity, respectively (15). The activity-specific MET value was then multiplied by the duration of

165

activity in number of hours per week.

166

Anthropometric and clinical measurements

167

All participants attended a series of extensive clinical examinations at the baseline visit by two trained

168

medical professionals. Weight and standing height were measured after removal of heavy clothing and

169

shoes. Waist and hip circumference were measured at standing position after taking a deep breath at the

170

thinnest spot of the waist and the widest spot of the hip, respectively. All anthropometric variables were

171

measured using SECA equipment. Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed using the Tanita MC-

172

780MA machine. Pulse oxymetry was performed using the H-100B EDAN. Systolic and diastolic blood

173

pressures were measured using the MicroLife A6 PC-AFIB PC monitor. Arterial stiffness was measured

174

using the Mobil-O-Graph PWA New Generation 24h ABPM Classic monitor (16). In addition, cognitive

175

function was assessed by three brief neuropsychological procedures, namely the Greek version of the Trail

176

Making test (17,18), Logical Memory (19) and the Verbal Fluency test (20), and administered by two

177

trained interviewers. Blood, urine and saliva samples were collected at recruitment after fasting for at least

178

eight hours from all participants. Serum glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (TCHOL), low- (LDL) and high-

179

density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were measured at a commercial laboratory

180

facility in Ioannina, Greece. Within- and between-lab variability was assessed on the same day on blind

181

duplicate aliquots in a random sample of 11 and 7 participants, respectively. Duplicate aliquots were

182

measured at the biochemistry laboratory of the University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece. The within-lab

183

coefficients of variation (%CV) were 0.88%, 0.85%, 0.62%, 1.31% and 1.20% for GLU, TCHOL, LDL,

184

HDL and TG, respectively, and 3.30%, 6.62%, 4.41%, 6.34% and 4.72% for the between-lab variability.

185

The COVID-19 sub-questionnaire

186

Due to the alarming spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the continuously increasing number of cases and

187

subsequent deaths globally, a set of 24 COVID-19-related questions was integrated in the standard EHS

188

questionnaire shortly after March 23rd, 2020, when lockdown measures were enforced in Greece, aiming to

189

depict the level of awareness, knowledge and trust to the Greek authorities regarding the COVID-19

190

pandemic. Three questions investigated participants’ alertness regarding the pandemic and five questions

191

assessed SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Twelve questions evaluated the

192

knowledge for the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, severity of COVID-19 and participants’ capability

193

of protecting themselves against SARS-CoV-2, and the last four questions examined participants’ beliefs

194

towards the available information regarding the pandemic and trust in the Greek Government and health

195

authorities for mitigating COVID-19. The COVID-19 sub-questionnaire was administered with face-to-

196

face interviews, except for participants who joined the study before May 18th, 2020, for whom telephone-

197

based interviews were conducted.

198
199

Assessment of knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic

200

A categorical variable was constructed to capture knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall

201

knowledge status was labeled as poor, moderate or good based on participants’ answers in the following

202

items: modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic cases and

203

COVID-19 severity. Poor knowledge was determined by answering “No” in at least one of the following

204

three questions: i) “Is SARS-CoV-2 transmitted by droplets in the air?”, ii) “Is SARS-CoV-2 transmitted

205

by contacting infected people?”, and iii) “Is SARS-CoV-2 transmitted by touching contaminated

206

surfaces?”. When participants answered correctly to all three aforementioned questions, they were further

207

asked whether an asymptomatic case could transmit the virus and their perceptive over COVID-19 severity.

208

If the corresponding answers were “No” and “Many people survive, many people die”, “Some people

209

survive, most people die” or “Almost everyone dies”, respectively, then the knowledge status was

210

characterized as moderate. Finally, good knowledge was established if participants answered correctly to

211

all aforementioned questions (Additional File 1).

212
213

Statistical analysis

214

Participants’ baseline characteristics were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD) for

215

continuous variables, and percentages for categorical variables. All questions included in the COVID-19

216

sub-questionnaire were summarized overall and by gender, age group (25-39, 40-49, 50-59, ≥60 years) and

217

date of interview (March 30th to May 3rd, 2020, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st,

218

2020 and July 1st to August 31st, 2020). Pearson’s chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were employed to

219

detect differences between subgroups.

220

An agnostic exposure-wide association analysis was conducted using ordinal logistic regression models to

221

quantify the associations between the level of participants’ knowledge towards the COVID-19 pandemic

222

and 153 categorical and continuous explanatory variables arising from participants’ interviews and clinical

223

examinations. Variables assessing verbal fluency were not considered eligible for our analysis due to high

224

proportion of missing values. Dichotomous variables with prevalence of less than 10% and variables

225

pertaining to a specific subgroup of participants (e.g. reproductive variables in women) were also excluded

226

for statistical power reasons. Multiple comparisons were corrected using a false discovery rate (FDR)

227

threshold of 5% based on the Benjamini–Hochberg approach (21). Continuous exposures and knowledge

228

status results are presented as odds ratios (OR) per 1 SD increment. All models were adjusted for continuous

229

age and sex. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA (version 14; StataCorp, College Station,

230

TX, USA)

RESULTS

233

Participant characteristics

234

Of the 667 subjects enrolled in the EHS cohort up to August 31st, 2020, we excluded 105 (15.7%)

235

participants who joined the study before March, 2020 and could not be reached via telephone to answer the

236

COVID-19 sub-questionnaire. The distribution of baseline descriptive characteristics is shown in Table 1,

237

and they were very similar between the EHS total and analytical sample. A total of 563 participants, 337

238

women and 226 men, constituted the analytical study sample, of them 170 women and 114 men completed

239

the study before May 4th, 2020 when lockdown measures were partially lifted. The mean age of participants

240

enrolled before or after May 4th, 2020 was 48.6 (SD=11.1) and 48.7 (SD=11.0) years, respectively. The

241

majority (66.4%) of participants had university education, 31% were current smokers, 43% drank alcohol

at least once per week, reported low levels of recreational physical activity and had a mean BMI of 26.6

243

kg/m2 (SD=4.7), and mean body fat percentage of 28.4% (SD=7.8) (Table 1).

244
245

Awareness towards COVID-19 pandemic

246

In Table 2, COVID-19-related questions are presented in the total analytical sample and by gender, age

247

group and period of interview. The vast majority of study participants (98.4%) were aware of the pandemic,

248

although a significant difference was observed by gender as male participants showed slightly smaller

249

awareness (96.9% vs 99.4%, p-value=0.034). Only 14 (2.5%) participants reported having a SARS-CoV-2

250

molecular test with none of them reporting a positive result. A total of 23 (4.5%) participants reported that

251

they believed they had contracted the virus, although not tested, and 42 (7.5%) participants reported

252

suffering from COVID-19-relevant symptoms during previous months, such as fever, cough, dyspnea and

253

loss of taste/smell. The percentage of participants reporting belief of self-infection and symptoms of SARS-

254

CoV-2 infection were higher for participants that joined the study during July and August, 2020 (15% and

255

21.7%, respectively) compared to previous months (p-value<0.001). Only two participants reported having

256

a family member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Approximately 33% of participants considered

257

themselves as absolutely capable of protecting themselves against SARS-CoV-2 with higher proportions

258

observed in earlier times of interview (by time period: 43.6% vs. 23.4% vs. 19.2%, p-value<0.001), whereas

259

4.3% and 27.6% reported absolute and moderate certainty that they will not get infected, respectively, and

260

the percentage of moderate certainty decreased with time (by time period: 33.3% vs. 27.4% vs. 14.2%, p-

261

value<0.001) (Table 2).

262
263

Knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes and COVID-19 severity

264

More than 95% of participants reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by droplets in the air, by

265

contacting infected people or by touching contaminated surfaces (Table 2). Approximately 14%, 28% and
11

266

4% of participants reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted through blood transfusion, sexual

267

intercourse or mosquito bite, respectively, and a larger proportion of participants younger than 50 years

268

compared to older participants reported that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through sexual intercourse

269

(p-value<0.001). Almost all participants (98%) reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by

270

asymptomatic cases. Concerning COVID-19 severity, most participants (94.5%) reported that most people

271

who contracted SARS-CoV-2 survive and some die (Table 2). When the questions regarding SARS-CoV-

272

2 transmission and COVID-19 severity were aggregated together, approximately 86% of study participants

273

demonstrated good level of knowledge without statistically significant differences between subgroups

274

(Table 3). Yet still, almost 5% of study participants lacked basic knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2

275

transmission routes. Similarly, a large proportion (88.3%) of participants declared that they had good or

276

very good knowledge on how to protect themselves against SARS-CoV-2 with better knowledge associated

277

with earlier interview periods (by time period: 89.4% vs. 94.3% vs. 79.2%, p-value<0.001) (Table 2).

Exposure-wide association analysis on knowledge status towards COVID-19 pandemic

280

Only 12 (7.8%) explanatory variables were found significantly associated with the level of participants’

281

knowledge towards the COVID-19 pandemic at the 0.05 level (see Figure 1 and Additional File 2). Odds

282

of having a lower knowledge status were associated with higher extracellular water-to-total body water

283

ratio, increased incapability to fall asleep within 30 minutes during last month, frequent talking on cellphone

284

away from the ear during last three months, lower self-reported health status, higher heart rate, frequent

285

pain at night during last month, having family members diagnosed with acute depression or osteoporosis/hip

286

fracture and limited interest for personal or professional activities during last two weeks. Higher pulse

287

volume, increased trust in national health authorities to limit spread of the virus and increased paid hours

288

of work per week were associated with higher level of knowledge. However, none of these associations

289

were significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Figure 1 and Additional File 2).

Trust in the Greek authorities for minimizing the spread of SARS-CoV-2

292

Publicly available information regarding COVID-19 pandemic was characterized as good (20.8%) and very

293

good (42.2%) by more than half of the study sample (Table 2), but the responses differed by time period

294

with more participants reporting better quality of information when interviewed before compared to after

295

May 4th, 2020 (by time period: 70.6% vs. 58.3% vs. 50.9%, p-value<0.001). The percentage of study

296

participants who reported absolute and moderate trust in the Greek Government for mitigating the spread

297

of the virus was 44% and 40.7%, respectively; these percentages increased with higher age of participants

298

(p-value=0.001) and were higher with earlier time of interview (absolute trust by time period: 55.7% vs.

299

41.9% vs. 17.7%, p-value<0.001). A similar pattern was observed with respect to trusting the Greek health

300

authorities for mitigating the spread of the virus and the official Greek sources of information regarding

301

COVID-19 pandemic (Table 2). When the weekly moving average of COVID-19 cases and deaths in

302

Greece were plotted versus the weekly moving average percentage of EHS participants who reported

303

absolute or moderate trust in the Greek authorities, participants’ trust seemed to decrease gradually with

304

time without following the pattern of COVID-19 cases in Greece (Figure 2).

305
306

DISCUSSION

307

This study evaluated the degree of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and the trust upon the official

308

authorities from March 30th to August 31st, 2020 in 563 participants of an ongoing cohort study in Greece.

309

The participants demonstrated high levels of knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-

310

19 severity without statistically significant differences by age, gender and time of interview. High levels of

311

trust in the Greek authorities for providing information and mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were

312

also observed, which were stronger in older participants and those that joined the study closer to the start

313

of the pandemic. We also examined in an agnostic fashion 153 potential correlates of the level of knowledge

314

about the pandemic, but no associations survived the multiple testing correction.

315

Participants were well-informed on the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via respiratory droplets,

316

contacting infected people or touching contaminated surfaces. The vast majority of them also understood

317

risk of infection caused by asymptomatic cases and the severity of COVID-19. Only a small percentage of

318

participants reported possibility of transmission through blood transfusion and mosquito bites, but 28% of

319

them reported that the virus could be transmitted by sexual intercourse. Even though medical professionals

320

understand sexual transmission as a separate entity, the general public may still consider the sexual

321

intercourse related risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as possible due to the presumed risk of infection through

322

respiratory droplets that takes place during sexual intercourse. Literature evidence on the knowledge and

323

attitudes of the Greek population towards the COVID-19 pandemic is limited. In a sample of 461 health

324

care professionals working in five public hospitals in the central region of Thessaly, Greece recruited in

325

February, 2020, 96% recognized that droplets is the main mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whereas

326

20% and 53% considered sex and food consumption, respectively, as possible modes of transmission (22).

327

Our findings are compatible with several studies conducted in various countries worldwide, in which

328

participants showed good knowledge for the transmission routes and the possible risk of infection imposed

329

by asymptomatic people (23–30). However, most studies recruited targeted populations, including health

330

care personnel, students and hospital visitors; thus, the generalization of their findings to the general public

331

was questionable.

332

When we further investigated the association between participants’ level of knowledge and a variety of

333

clinical parameters, medical history, demographic and lifestyle factors, positive associations emerged at the

334

nominal statistical significance level between participants’ level of knowledge and trust in the Greek health

335

authorities for managing the spread of the virus and the hours of paid work per week. Poorer health status,

336

certain sleep disorder symptoms, higher heart rate and limited interest for participating in social and

337

professional activities were inversely associated with higher knowledge status that could be explained by

338

poorer ability to process relevant medical information. After adjustment for multiple testing, none of these

339

factors remained significant (smallest FDR-adjusted p-value= 0.19). The relatively small sample size and

340

the lack of large variability across participants’ level of knowledge may partially explain our null results.

341

The majority of participants expressed high levels of trust in the Greek authorities for providing information

342

and mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These results might be attributed to the immediacy of the Greek

343

Government on enacting strict measures shortly after the registration of the first cases of COVID-19 in

344

Greece. Previous studies have reported mixed results for participants’ trust in politicians and governmental

345

authorities during the pandemic. Online surveys contacted in the USA and African countries suggested that

346

the proportion of participants who showed trust in the corresponding Governments ranged from 10.2% to

347

38.6% (31–33). On the other hand, samples of Malaysian, Australian and Israeli residents considered

348

governmental authorities as credible and capable to handle the COVID-19 health crisis (28,34,35). These

349

contradictory findings highlight the magnitude in which the different strategies followed worldwide for the

350

management of the pandemic and the resulting pandemic severity affect public standpoint.

351

Stratified analyses by time period of interview showed that the high levels of trust in the Greek authorities

352

to mitigate spread of the virus waned with time, as the percentage of absolute and moderate trust in the

353

Greek Government and health authorities decreased from approximately 92% and 94% in March/April,

354

2020 to 61% and 73% in July/August, 2020, respectively. Visual inspection of the trends did not provide

355

any insights on a potential correlation between the weaning trust and the patterns of the number of

356

confirmed COVID-19 cases or the subsequent deaths in Greece. Potential explanations for the gradual

357

decline in participants’ trust could be the negative economic and perceived health impact of lockdown

358

measures on post-lockdown participants’ beliefs and trust upon officials, and the resurgence of the epidemic

359

in August, 2020 in Greece.

360

This study is one of the first population-based studies conducted in Greece that not only attempted to shed

361

light on participants’ perceptions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and trust upon authorities but also

362

evaluated trends by age, gender and time of assessment that can provide guidance for future public health

363

policies tailored to certain population subgroups. Another strength of the study includes that the COVID-

364

19-related data were collected as part of an ongoing prospective and heavily phenotyped epidemiological

365

study, which provided the ability to systematically examine a number of potential factors and correlates in

366

relation to participants’ level of knowledge for the pandemic. Several limitations should also be considered

367

in interpreting our findings. The sample size was relatively small, but several of our findings have been

368

previously observed in larger studies. The study sample constituted only by residents of the region of Epirus

369

and had a higher participation of women and individuals with university education; thus, findings might

370

not be generalizable to the general public. As a validated questionnaire to assess knowledge on the COVID-

371

19 pandemic is not yet available, we constructed an aggregated variable to assess knowledge of SARS-

372

CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 severity that showed relatively poor variation, as most individuals

373

reported good levels of knowledge.

374
375

CONCLUSIONS

376

In the current study, participants showed an advanced level of knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission

377

and COVID-19 severity, and high levels of trust in the Greek authorities for providing information and

378

mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The level of trust in the authorities weakened with time, which

379

might highlight the importance of following evidence-based decision-making processes in managing the

380

pandemic, and developing efficient collaborations between public health officials and Governments to

381

sustain continued, accurate and higher effort information campaigns to increase public awareness.

Figure 1: Volcano plot showing results from the exposure-wide association study regarding the association between 153 clinical parameters, medical
characteristics, demographic and lifestyle factors and knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes and COVID-19 severity in the Epirus
Health Study cohort. The Y-axis shows the p-values in −log10 scale from the ordinal logistic regression models for each factor. The X-axis shows the estimated
odds ratios for each factor. All models were adjusted for continuous age and gender. The black points indicate the continuous/ordinal exposures and the grey
points indicate the categorical exposures. The dashed horizontal line represents the nominal level of statistical significance (0.05) and the solid horizontal line
represents the FDR-corrected level of statistical significance (0.0003268).
