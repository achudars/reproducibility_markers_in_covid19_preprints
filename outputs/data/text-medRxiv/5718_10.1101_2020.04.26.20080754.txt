ABSTRACT
Background: The coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, causing the disease called COVID-19,
spread more than 200 countries and continents end of the March. There is a lot of data since the virus
started. However, these data will be explanatory when accurate analyzes are made and will allow
future predictions to be made. In this study, it was aimed to model the outbreak with different time
series models and also predict the indicators.
Methods: The data was collected from 25 countries which have different process at least 20 days.
ARIMA(p,d,q), Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt’s Two Parameter, Brown’s Double Exponential
Smoothing Models were used. The prediction and forecasting values were obtained for the countries.
Trends and seasonal effects were also evaluated.
Results: China has almost under control according to forecasting. The cumulative death prevalence in
Italy and Spain will be the highest, followed by the Netherlands, France, England, China, Denmark,
Belgium, Brazil and Sweden respectively as of the first week of April. The highest daily case
prevalence was observed in Belgium, America, Canada, Poland, Ireland, Netherlands, France and
Israel between 10% and 12%.The lowest rate was observed in China and South Korea. Turkey was
one of the leading countries in terms of ranking these criteria. The prevalence of the new case and the
recovered were higher in Spain than Italy.
Conclusions: More accurate predictions for the future can be obtained using time series models with a
wide range of data from different countries by modelling real time and retrospective data.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2), which started in Wuhan, China in December 2019,
has been recognized as a global threat and it turned into a pandemic that threatened two hundred
countries at the end of March. Although there are differences in various indicators such as cumulative
case and cumulative death among countries, the outbreak can be estimated with various mathematical
models. For this purpose, various models such as logistics model, Bertalanffy model, Gompertz
model1, Cubic Curve2, Exponential Curve, ARIMA models3, phenomenological models4, optimization
algorithms5 have been examined before. But the estimates have been made for several countries such
as China, Japan and USA, whose data are relatively much more1-9. In many countries, the total number
of cases reached very high at the end of March, and the outbreak period has exceeded one month.
Under these conditions, modeling the data collected from many countries to define the outbreak
process and the characteristics of the outbreak, to take precautions and to create projection for the
countries where the outbreak has begun or will began is of great importance.
In this study, it was aimed to model the outbreak for six indicators from twenty five countries with
different starting dates and processing at least twenty days of data using the end of March data. For
this purpose, ARIMA (p, d, q), Simple Exponential Smoothing Model, Holt’s Two Parameter Model,
Brown’s Double Exponential Smoothing Models were used. Then prediction and forecasting values
were presented for the countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data - Indicators and Models
In the study, twenty five countries were selected which cumulative cases exceeding 1000 among the
160 countries have exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak before March 15 and data for six indicators
were modeled. The countries selected for modeling were divided into periods at certain intervals
according to the start times of the outbreak and was presented in Table 1 as a summary. The number of
countries struggling with the outbreak increased to 200 at the end of March but data from 40 countries
that did not contain sufficient data for modeling and started to struggle the outbreak after March 15

were excluded from the study. Since at least one of the countries which was announcing the first case
at different periods, was selected for modeling, the results to be obtained from these countries will
create a prediction for other countries under similar conditions and for countries that have just started
the outbreak.

Time Series Models used in the Study
ARIMA (p,d,q): ARIMA time series are non-stationary time series, AR, MA and ARMA processes are
stationary series. Generally, non-stationary processes are encountered in applications. Because, in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.26.20080754; this version posted May 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

practice, data generally varies due to seasonal, irregular movements or incidental reasons. The process
becomes stationary when the non-stationary ARIMA time series is taken from the appropriate degree.
ARIMA processes are expressed in ARIMA (p, d, q) notation. Here, p indicates the degree of
autoregressive process, d is the difference of degrees, and q is the degree of the moving averages
process. The ARIMA (p, d, q) process includes both AR (p), MA (q) and ARIMA (p, q) processes.
The ARIMA process is an integrated autoregressive moving average process. In the ARIMA models,
where d = 1, p and q is 0, then the ARIMA (0,1,0) process is obtained, which is defined as the random
walk process10-12.
When the first difference of the non-stationary

series is taken (d=1), the ∆



equation is obtained. If the series is not still stationary, a second difference is taken. ∆

is obtained. In this case, d = 2. Therefore, the non-stationary series is

made stationary and shows the ARMA process. The model takes the form of ARIMA (p, d, q). In the
method, trial method is used to determine the appropriate p, d and q values. Therefore, this method has
the disadvantage, but it gives very good results in short term estimations. While d value is determined
as the number of differences in the series, p and q values are obtained by examining partial
autocorrelation and autocorrelation functions, respectively. The least squares method or nonlinear
methods are used in parameter estimates. Assessment of goodness of fit is investigated by AIC and
SIC criteria. In addition, compliance with the white noise process is checked for model suitability. The
model must comply with the white noise process10-12.
Simple Exponential Smoothing Model: The advantage of the model is that it can be applied in series
with stochastic trends and the estimates can be updated by evaluating the latest changes in the data.
The updating is done by giving different weights to the historical data. In cases where periodic and
irregular fluctuations are very large, when there is no trend and seasonality, the use of exponential
smoothing methods enables more accurate estimations. In the exponential smoothing method, a
smoothing coefficient is used and it gives decreasing values according to the distances from today's
period13.

0.3 range is used. For optimal selecting smoothing parameters, researchers can perform different range

values. The , which gives the lowest average standard error value, will be the best choice13.

The simple exponential smoothing method is only suitable for time series that move around an
average. In the moving averages method, equal weight is given to the period values by experiment
while different weights are given in the simple exponential smoothing method and these values are
becoming exponential shape. In the simple exponential smoothing method, higher values are given to
recently obtained values in weighting. The simple exponential smoothing method is often used to
estimate short-term predictions13.
Holt’s Two Parameter Model: The Holt’s two parameter model is used when there is a trend in the
data. But in the data there is no seasonality. In the method, while each forecast is obtained, the
previous forecast is updated and new forecast values are obtained. Since the method also takes into
account the trend in the data, it is slightly more complicated than moving averages and simple
exponential smoothing methods14.
Holt’s two parameter model is created with the help of the following equations.

In the above functions, p is the number of periods predicted, while the value of  is the new smoothed
value, while  is the trend estimate value and

is the actual value in period t. The   is the post

period prediction value14.
Method uses trend estimates, so in the model there is two coefficients. α is the smoothing coefficient
and the β is the coefficient used for trend estimation. These coefficients ranges between 0 and 1. The

alpha and beta coefficients that make the total error square minimum are chosen as the most
appropriate parameter value.
Brown’s Double Exponential Smoothing Model: This model was obtained as a result of the
development of the simple exponential smoothing method. While the series contains trends, it does not
include seasonality. Equations of the method is given in the below15.

Here  is the predicted level in time t, while  is the predicted trend in time. If there is an increase
and decrease in the series in the data set, Brown's model gives better results. In the method, two
different smoothed series are used, which are located in two different centers. Brown’s method tries to
create a linear equation. Estimates include single and double smoothed constants. Therefore, the
method takes its name from this feature15.
Statistical Analysis
In modeling, cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, daily cases, daily deaths, cumulative recovered and
active cases, which are indicators of the COVID-19 outbreak, were used. The models with the most
successful results were selected and 10-day forecasts after the modelling were calculated. In the
modelling process, autocorrelation values were calculated in the data and seasonality and trend of the

data were examined. The largest R-square value and the smallest RMSE and Normalized BIC values
were used for the model performance.
RESULTS
The results of the China is very important for many countries because the COVID-19 outbreak first
began in China. In addition, China has caused the outbreak to spread to many countries and has been
fighting this epidemic for 3 months. Also, as of the end of March, it is the fifth country with the
highest number of cases and total deaths in the world When the modeling results of China data were
investigated considering six different indicators, It was seen that the first four indicators were modeled
with high success, and sufficient success was reached in the modeling of cumulative recovered (Table
2). However, there was no suitable time series model that successfully models active cases. (R-squared
< 0,50).

Estimates of different indicator data obtained from China are shown in Figure 1. From the graphs, it
was seen that there was no significant change in the number of cumulative cases and the number of
cumulative deaths as of the end of March. But the number of cumulative recovered was seen to
increase. Daily cases and daily death were close to the minimum level.
Figure 1. Predicting and forecasting of indicators for China
In 11 out of 24 countries that detected the first Coronavirus cases in the period of 16-31 January, the
total number of cases was over 1000. So the data of the indicators used in the prediction of the
outbreak process were modeled and the results are presented in Table 4 and Table 5. It was seen that
the activated cases can be modeled successfully in 6 out of 11 countries, and there was no time series
model that produces a successful forecast for other countries (Table 4, R-squared < 0,50). In addition,
success in modeling the number of cumulative recovered numbers in several countries was between
70% and 85%, while the prediction success of models for other indicators was calculated around 99%.

Spain was the 2nd country with the highest total number of deaths and the 4th country with the total
number of cases. The forecast values for 10 days after modeling were presented in Table 6 and Figure
3. It can be seen from the graphs that the number of cases and deaths continues to increase rapidly.

South Korea was a country that has controlled the number of cumulative cases and cumulative deaths
since the outbreak. The number of new deaths per day has never exceeded 10. After modeling the
obtained data, the 10-day predicted results were given in Table 7 and Figure 4. It was predicted that
the changes in the indicators will not change in the first half of April when the table is evaluated.

Germany has been the most successful European country that managed the outbreak for a long time.
When the 10-day forecast values given in Table 8 and the forecast of the models in Figure 5 were
examined, it was seen that there will be an increase in the indicators similar to the current days and the
cumulative death in the cumulative case is very low (1%).

When Malaysia results were analyzed, it was predicted that the number of daily deaths will be very
low and the cumulative death prevalence in the cumulative case will be 1% in the first week of April.
In addition, the daily case prevalence was estimated to be around 6% and the cumulative recovered
prevalence around 15% (Table 15 and Figure 12). These results emphasized that Malaysia has shown
successful results in struggle with the outbreak.

When Iran data is modeled, it was predicted that the daily mortality prevalence in the cumulative case
will be low in the first week of April, the daily case prevalence would be around 6% and the
cumulative recovered prevalence will be around 30% (Table 19 and Figure 14).

When Portugal's results were analyzed, it was predicted that daily new death and cumulative recovered
prevalence would be quite low in the first week of April. On the other hand, the prevalence of daily
cases in the cumulative cases was at most 15% and it was predicted that this prevalence will decrease
gradually, but the cumulative active cases prevalence would be 95% (Table 30 and Figure 23).

It was predicted that cumulative death, daily new death and cumulative recovered prevalence would be
quite low in the first week of April when Poland results were analyzed. The prevalence of daily new
cases in the cumulative case was estimated at around 20% (Table 31 and Figure 24).

When the results of Turkey were analyzed, it was seen that the cumulative death prevalence in the
cumulative case was about 1% in the first week of April, the daily case prevalence showed a decline,
the forecast was around 6% on the tenth day and the cumulative recovered prevalence was around 2%
(Table 33 and Figure 25).

In the table, on the 5th day after modeling for each country, it was calculated as the prevalence of the
indicators in the cumulative cases as %. When the table was investigated, in the first week of April it
was seen that the cumulative death prevalence in Italy and Spain is the highest, followed by the
Netherlands, France, UK China, Denmark, Belgium, Brazil and Sweden respectively. The daily new
case proportion in cumulative cases can also be considered as an indicator of an increase or decrease in
the severity of the outbreak. When this indicator was evaluated, it can be said that the highest values
was observed in Belgium, USA, Canada, Poland, Ireland, Netherlands, France, and Israel, which vary
between 10% and 12% and the lowest proportions was observed in China and South Korea. The daily
deaths proportion in the cumulative case was low in many countries and similar. But it is lowest in
Netherlands. The cumulative recovered proportion in the cumulative case is the another important
criteria for outbreak. This proportion was the highest in China, followed by South Korea. However,
the highest value was in Switzerland (16.45%) among the ten countries exposed to the outbreak after
February 21. The prevalence was found 1.75% for Turkey. Finally, the active case proportion in
cumulative case was another criterion that can be used to evaluate the course of the outbreak. The
predicted active case proportions are high in most of countries. This result shows that there are many
people in the active disease period.

Conclussion
The results obtained from the evaluations made with limited epidemiological data at the beginning of
March or earlier have transferred some information to the present. As of the end of March, the longest
3.5 months and the shortest 1 month data are available and their evaluation is of great importance. The
results of this study gives an important information for the countries struggling with the outbreak in
less than one month or who have not yet been exposed to the outbreak. Also future models that can be
simulated against similar risks will be obtained.
It was predicted that the outbreak in China was almost under control as a result of the models obtained
with this study. The number of cases and deaths has increased rapidly in Italy and the country could
not control the outbreak since the outbreak started. However, it was seen that there was a relatively
increase in the proportion of the recovered. Both the rapid case increase to date and the increase seen
in future forecasts show that Spain has not yet been able to control the outbreak. The new case and
recovered case proportions were higher than Italy. It is seen that there has not been a significant
decrease in the severity of the outbreak, although it has been 2.5 months since Italy and Spain

announced the first case. South Korea, which started to fight the outbreak in the same period, was the
most successful country in terms of results, followed by Germany. The results in Iran was better than
Israel, which is in the same period, and France that the outbreak started 1 month ago. The results of
Turkey was similar to Germany and Ireland.
The differences and advantages of this study from the modelling studies published before can be
summarized as follows.
•

Modeling and comparative analysis of real-time and retrospective data of 25 countries with a
total number of cases exceeding 1000 among infected countries until 10 March,

•

The number of data of the most countries has reached sufficient size to develop a good model

•

It is also the evaluation of trend and seasonal effect in time series models.
