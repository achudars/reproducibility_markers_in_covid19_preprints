Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no
licensed vaccine or specific antiviral agents for therapy. Little is known about the
longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in
COVID-19 patients. Methods: Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30
COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for
SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with
the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. Results: SARS-CoV-2-specific
NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symtom onset and increased after 2-3
weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom
onset. NAb titers in 93.3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3month study period, with a median decrease of 34.8% (IQR 19.6-42.4%). NAb
titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating
well at week 3 (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant
positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including
SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF. Conclusions:These data provide useful information
regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and
convalescent phases.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a novel respiratory disease that is
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since
the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 last year, it has spread rapidly and caused a global
pandemic.1 As of July 3, 2020, over 10 million people worldwide have been
reportedly infected and more than 512,000 individuals have died of COVID-19.2
Currently, considerable progress is being made to understand SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis, epidemiology, antiviral drug development, and vaccine design.
However, no licensed specific antiviral drugs or prophylactic vaccines are
available. Developing effective viral inhibitors and antibody-based therapeutics to
prevent or treat COVID-19 infection is a high global priority.

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome encodes 29 structural and non-structural proteins,
including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins,
and the ORF1a/b polyprotein.3 The S glycoprotein is responsible for SARS-CoV-2
attachment and entry into target host cells via its binding to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor.4 Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies
(NAbs) play a key role in reducing viral replication and increasing viral
clearance.5,6 NAbs act against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARSCoV-2 S protein, effectively blocking viral entry. Thus, serological testing,
especially to detect NAbs, is essential in determining the onset of the serological

immune response, evaluating the potential capacity of the host body for viral
clearance, and identifying donors for passive antibody therapy trials.

In COVID-19 patients, NAbs can be detected within 2 weeks of symptom onset.7,8
The serological antibody response continues for at least 3 weeks and, in some
cases, substantially longer.9,10 However, the dynamics and roles of SARS-CoV-2specific NAbs and their correlation with antibody responses have not been
explored in COVID-19 patients more than two months after symptom onset.

In this study, we first analyzed the 3-month longitudinal dynamics of in vitro NAb
titers in 30 recovered COVID-19 patients. Second, we evaluated the correlation
between the dynamics of NAb titers and serological IgG levels, as well as
inflammatory cytokine levels. Our study may provide useful information regarding
dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and
convalescent phases and aid in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV2.

Materials and methods

and characterize the dynamic changes in virus-specific IgG and NAb titers.

Ethical approval. The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of
Chongqing Medical University (ref. no. 2020003). Written informed consent was
waived by the Ethics Commission of the designated hospital for emerging
infectious diseases.

Plasmids
The codon-optimized gene encoding the SARS-CoV S protein (AAP13567.1) and
SARS-CoV-2 S protein (QHD43416) with the 19 C-terminal amino acids deleted
were synthesized by Sino Biological Inc (Beijing, China) and cloned into the the
pCMV3 vector, respectively. The HIV-1 NL4-3 ΔEnv Vpr luciferase reporter vector
(pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-), constructed by N. Landau,11 was provided by Cheguo Cai,
Wuhan University (Wuhan, China). The vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)expressing plasmid pMD2.G was provided by Prof. Ding Xue, Tsinghua University
(Beijing, China).

Cell lines
HEK293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified

Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Hyclone, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA), 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and
100 U/mL of penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . HEK293T cells transfected with human
ACE2 (293T-ACE2) were cultured under the same conditions, with the addition of
G418 (0·5 mg/mL) to the medium.

Production and titration of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirus
The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were generated as previously
described, with some modifications.12 Briefly, HEK293T cells (5 × 106) were cotransfected with pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- and recombinant SARS-CoV S or SARS-CoV-2
S plasmid using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen,
Rockville, MD), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were
transferred to fresh DMEM 12 h later. The supernatant containing pseudovirions
were harvested 48 h after transfection and passed through a 0·45-μm filter. To
construct the VSV-G pseudovirus, pMD2.G was co-transfected with the pNL43.Luc.R-E- plasmid. Viral titers (RNA copy number, copies/mL) were determined
by real-time RT-qPCR using primers targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR)
region.13

The 293T-ACE2 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. For the
neutralization assay, 50 μL of pseudovirus (3·8 × 104 copies) was incubated with
serial dilutions of serum samples from patients and human control serum as a
negative control for 1 h at 37 °C and then added to the 96-well 293T-ACE2 plates.
After 12 h of infection, fresh culture was added to each well. After 72 h postinfection, the 293T-ACE2 cells were lysed with 30 μL lysis buffer (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) to measure pseudoviral transduction. Relative luminescence
units of Luc activity were determined using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega).
Titers of NAbs were calculated as the 50% inhibitory dose (ID 50 ).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median (inter-quartile range, IQR) and
categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage, %). Comparisons
between two groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher’s
exact test. A two-sided α of <0·05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using R software, v3.6.0. Twotailed Pearson correlation test was used to calculate the correlation coefficient of
NAb to IgG levels or cytokines.

Results
Clinical characteristics
Of the total 30 patients in the cohort, 60·0% (18/30) were female, and 10·0%
(3/30) were categorized as severe based on the COVID-19 Treatment guidelines
(National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China) (Table 1). The
median length of the hospital stay was 22 d (IQR 15–26).

Specific serum response to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection
Sera from five representative COVID-19 convalescent patients, collected during
the fourth week following symptom onset, were analyzed for their NAb titers
against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of 293T-ACE2 cells. All five serum
samples demonstrated neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
infection, with the ID 50 value of 173.5, 267.9, 532.7, 730.4 and 1114, while the
control serum from healthy individuals showed no neutralizing activity (Figure 1A
and B). Furthermore, 30 plasma samples with strong SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
activity were evaluated for neutralization of VSV-G, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2
pseudoviruses. No detectable neutralization was found against the SARS-CoV and
VSV-G pseudovirus control (Figure 1C). These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2
infection could not stimulate strong cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARSCoV.

Dynamic changes in neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
We analyzed the longitudinal dynamics of virus-specific IgG and NAb levels in 30
patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RT-qPCR. Sequential
serum samples were collected from patients in the acute phase (5–6 samples) and
the convalescent phase (two follow-up points: 60 d [54–63 d] and 96 d [90–99 d]
after symptom onset). SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low before day 7–10
and increased at week 2–3 after symptom onset. The highest NAb levels were
detected 3 months after symptom onset in 28 of 30 (93.3%) COVID-19 patients
(Figure 2A). The median time for peak NAb levels was 33 d (IQR 24–59 d) after
symptom onset, and the NAb levels plateaued in 60% (18/30) of the COVID-19
patients during hospitalization (Figure 2B). The peak NAb levels varied among the
patients; 6·7%, 73·3%, and 20% patients showed low (ID 50 < 500), medium-low
(ID 50 500–999), and medium-high (ID 50 1000–2500) NAb titers, respectively
(Figure 2C). There was no statistical difference among peak NAb titers that
occurred during hospitalization and convalescence (Figure 2D).

The duration and maintenance of peak of NAb levels in COVID-19 patients is of
great concern. Thus, we compared NAb levels between the peak time point and
the final follow-up time point. A decline in NAb levels was observed in 93·3%
(28/30) of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with a median decrease of 34·8% (IQR
19.6–42.4%) (Figure 3A). Patients were also grouped according to their rate of

decrease in NAb levels; more than 20% of the patients showed a >70% decrease
in NAb levels during this time period (21/30) (Figure 3B).

Correlation between dynamics of NAbs and IgG levels in COVID-19 patients
The kinetic levels of NAbs and virus-specific IgG over time in COVID-19 patients
are still unknown. To address this, we first determined the relationship between
aligned the NAb levels and virus-specific IgG levels in individual patients (Figure
4A and Supplementary Figure 1); similar dynamic changes were observed for the
NAbs and virus-specific IgG levels in some patients. Furthermore, to determine if
there was a statistical correlation between NAb levels and virus-specific IgG levels
in COVID-19 patients, serum samples were grouped by time (weeks) after
symptom onset. A statistically significant positive correlation was only observed in
samples obtained 3 weeks after symptom onset (p = 0·027, r = 0·410) (Figure 4B).

Roles of cytokines in B cell function or antibody production
We analyzed the correlation between cytokine and chemokine levels and NAb
levels in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase. Interestingly, we observed
that NAb levels were positively correlated with stem cell factor (SCF) (r = 0·616, p
= 0·001), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (r = 0·514, p = 0·008),
and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (r = 0·454, p = 0·017) levels
(Figure 5).

Discussion
Virus-specific NAbs have been considered an important determinant for viral
clearance. The pseudovirus-based assay is suitable for the high-throughput
screening of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in plasma donors without the requirement of BSL3 laboratories. The assay has been widely used for evaluating NAbs in highly
pathogenic viruses, such as Ebola, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and highly
pathogenic influenza viruses.14 Herein, we described the dynamics of SARS-CoV2-specific NAbs generated during both the acute and convalescent phases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay. We found
that SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low before day 7–10, peaked at
approximately day 33 after symptom onset, and then gradually declined over a 3month period. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected concurrently
with and positively correlated with IgG antibodies in our cohort, indicating that the
NAb response may play an important role in viral clearance.

Our understanding of the duration and nature of protective immunity to SARSCoV-2 is currently very limited. The kinetics of antibody-mediated immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and how long this immunity lasts are unknown. Our data
suggest that NAb titers in patients were variable, and the protective humoral
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may abate over time, which is in accordance
with findings in patients infected with other human coronaviruses, such as HCoV11

229E.15,16 The short-term humoral immune response in COVID-19 patients is also
highly consistent with that observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV,17,18 who show a rapid decrease in virus-specific antibody titers within
3–4 months.

Among the 30 recovered patients in our study, two patients showed very low NAb
titers during the acute phase and 3-month follow-up, indicating that other immune
responses, involving T cells and inflammatory cytokines may have contributed to
viral clearance. These data suggest that the antibody titers may diminish with time
or some recovered patients may not produce a high-titer response during SARSCoV-2 infection.

Recently, in a rhesus macaques model, SARS-CoV-2 infection evoked a robust
protective immune response when the animals were re-exposed to SARS-CoV-2
one month after the initial viral infection.19 However, natural infection and volunteer
challenge studies hint that coronavirus infections, including those with HCoV-229E
and HCoV-OE43, cannot induce stable protective immunity; thus, reinfection
occurs frequently. Moreover, a SARS-CoV antigen-specific memory B cell
response was not detectable in recovered SARS patients at 6-years after disease
onset, whereas SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells persisted in recovered SARS
patients.20,21 Although the role of memory T cells in the protective immune

response to SARS-CoV-2 needs further evaluation, a robust T cell response is
required for viral clearance.

We also described here, the dynamic correlation between SARS-CoV-2-specific
NAbs and serological total IgG levels. NAb titers appeared concomitantly and
correlated moderately with IgG levels at week 3 after symptom onset, which is
consistent with other reports regarding COVID-19 recovered patients10,22. The
antigen epitope used for IgG detection in our study contained the nucleoprotein
peptide, as well as the RBD domain of the spike protein, which partially explains
the discrepancy in NAb titers and IgG levels at weeks 4, 9, and 14 after symptom
onset. The nucleoprotein is the most abundant protein in the SARS-CoV-2 viral
particle and possesses the strongest immunogenicity. The binding antibodies
detected by the total IgG assay may also be involved in viral clearance through
antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, Therefore, the roles of binding antibodies and
NAbs in disease progression need further evaluation.

Currently, adaptive immunotherapy using convalescent plasma (CP) from
recovered COVID-19 patients is being employed as a potential therapeutic
approach to confer antiviral protection.23 Several preliminary clinical trials have
proven its effectiveness in treating SARS-CoV-2.6,24 The efficacy of CP transfusion
is attributed to the neutralizing effect of antibodies; thus, the NAb titer is the major

determinant for CP therapy. Monitoring NAb levels and their duration will provide
valuable data for evaluating the effectiveness of CP therapy. In our study, the
levels of NAbs declined gradually over the 3-month follow-up period, with a median
decrease of 34.8%. Thus, CP samples with high titers of NAbs from patients in the
early stage of convalescence will be more suitable for clinical use.

There are some limitations to this study, which should be addressed. Due to the
small sample size, we could not find any correlation between the dynamics of NAb
titers and clinical characteristics contributing to different clinical outcomes.
Serological blood samples were collected up to 3 months after symptom onset;
data collected over longer follow-up times should be obtained to demonstrate the
duration of humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lack of data to
determine an anamnestic immune response, such as tests for SARS-CoV-2specific memory B cells, memory T cells, and specific cytokine-dependent memory
cells, hampered the evaluation of the immune response, especially protective
immunity against viral reinfection. These are major issues that should be
investigated in future studies.

In summary, we determined the dynamics of NAb titers within 3 months after
symptom onset in 30 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and found a positive
correlation between NAb titers and IgG antibodies. Our work provides valuable

described a pseudotype system for measuring NAb titers, which could be
expanded to antiviral drug screening and vaccine development.

Figure legends
Figure. 1. Analysis of the plasma response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) Sera
from five convalescent COVID-19 patients neutralized the SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus. A serum sample from a healthy individual served as the negative
control. The assay was performed in triplicate, and the median percentage of
neutralization is shown. (B) SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers of 20
plasma samples from COVID-19 convalescent patients and ten plasma samples
from healthy donors. (C) Neutralizing antibody titers against VSV, SARS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in the sera from 30 convalescent COVID-19 patients.
Student’s t-test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

and the final follow-up time point. B. Percentage decrease in neutralizing
antibodies in COVID-19 patients.

Figure 4. Correlation between the dynamics of neutralizing antibody and
virus-specific IgG levels. A. Kinetics of neutralizing antibody (NAb) and IgG
levels in six patients. Plasma samples were collected at different time-points after
symptom onset. B. 152 serum samples were grouped by time of collection after
symptom onset; correlations were analyzed between neutralizing antibody levels
and IgG levels in each group. C. Correlations between neutralizing antibody levels
and IgG levels from serum samples collected 3 weeks after symptom onset.

Figure 5. Correlation between peak neutralizing antibody levels and
cytokines in sera. Serum samples with the highest neutralizing antibody (NAb)
levels for all individuals were collected during hospitalization. Cytokine or levels
were measured using the Bio-Plex Human Cytokine Screening Panel (48-Plex no.
12007283, Bio-Rad) on a Luminex 200 (Luminex Multiplexing Instrument, Merck
Millipore), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Pearson’s correlation was
used to analyze differences between NAb levels and cytokine levels.
