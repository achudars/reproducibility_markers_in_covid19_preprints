Introduction

28

In the past six months, Chinese people have been on a high level of

29

containment due to the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 throughout

30

China [1]. However, due to the convenient of global transportation,

31

the virus has rapidly spread to all corners of the world. The

32

coronavirus was first discovered in Wuhan, at the early stage, due to

33

people lack of knowledge about the virus and the scarcity of medical

34

resources, people were not aware of the virus. Relatively little knows

35

about the disease, people neglect to control it in its early stages, until

36

the earliest official announcement that the disease can be spread

37

from person to person on January 20, 2020 [2]. Then, the

38

government took a series of measures to prevent the spread of the

41

Governments took many measures by closing down public places,

42

broadcasting propaganda, isolating people in their own homes, etc.,

43

which leads to the increased awareness of self-protection for people.

44

The epidemic has been successful control in China, but now the

45

world is not optimistic, with over 40 million people now cumulatively

46

diagnosed worldwide. The cumulative number of deaths is over 1.2

47

million, especially in countries such as the United States, Brazil,

48

Russia, and India, the pandemic is still quite severe today [3,4].

49

Therefore, each countries and states should adopt prevention and

50

control strategies. Currently, it is very important to establish and

51

analyze disease-spreading model to predict disease development

52

trends in order to control and prevent the spread of the COVID-19.

53

Due to the outbreak of disease, vaccines and medicine treatments

54

for the disease are still being researched, non-drug treatment

55

becomes the main strategy to slow down the spread of the disease.

56

The purpose of most of these prediction and control measures is to

57

reduce the probability of infection spreading during direct or indirect

58

contact [5]. For example, paying attention to personal hygiene and

59

wearing a mask, keeping social distancing and closing some public

60

space such as schools and workplaces, in order to decrease the

61

opportunities of propagation from person to person. Other measures

62

like cutting off the way of transmission of diseases, such as

63

disinfection in public places, improving the level of sanitation in public

64

places and so on. All of these measures can alleviate the propagation

65

of the epidemic [6-9]. How to quantify the impact of various

66

prevention and control strategies on disease spreading is of great

67

significance to guide disease control.

68

A common method utilizes mathematical modelling to describe

69

the spreading dynamics of infectious diseases, like Ebola, SARS.

70

This can accurately describe the spread of disease among individuals

71

in theoretical framework to guide the development of the prevention

72

and control measures [10-13]. There are many researchers studied

73

epidemic spreading have proposed some epidemic model and

74

obtained some meaningful results. The classical epidemic models

75

like susceptible-infected (SI), susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR),

76

susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered

77

susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered-susceptible

78

[14-19]. Most of these models are applicable to describe disease

79

spreading with a long incubation period, such as COVID-19. Based

80

on data-driven, a modified SEIR model was proposed to analysis and

81

prediction COVID-19 spread [20]. Considering the effect of

82

quarantine, B. K. Mishra et.al proposed three quarantine models to

83

analyze COVID-19 spreading [21]. Other recent studies, some

84

researchers have considered the effects of the basic reproductive

85

number, international conveyance, and some stochastic based

86

regression models to prediction and control the COVID-19 disease

87

[22,23]. However, traditional epidemic spreading models consider

88

that all infected individual have the same infection rate, and the

89

prediction of disease development trend has certain limitations.

90

Although data-driven disease spreading models can accurately

91

describe infection rates, the impact of government prevention and

92

control measures on infection rates has not been quantitatively in

93

detail. These measures, such as the laws, medical supplies, media

94

coverage and investment, can reduce the spread of the disease. It is

95

necessary to rationally arrange the optimal prevention and control

96

strategies with limited resources to minimize the death rate.

97

To solve this problem, the GA and ANN hybrid method is

98

proposed to optimize epidemic dynamics model and predict the

99

COVID-19 spreading [24-27]. Genetic algorithm is an adaptive global

100

optimization search algorithm formed by simulating the genetic and

101

evolutionary process of biological species in the natural environment

102

[28]. It uses the viewpoint of biogenetics and realizes the

103

improvement of individual adaptability through the mechanism of

104

natural selection, heredity and variation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is

105

considered one of the most successful achievements of computer

106

science, simulating the behavior of the human brain in data analysis.

107

One of the AI branches is the artificial neural network (ANN). This

108

information processing system, by a simulating strategy like

109

communication between brain neurons, has become a tool for

110

analyzing complex and real systems [29]. In recent years, ANN

111

models have been developed to overcome the difficulties presented

112

by health issues.

113

This article focuses on how to quantify the impact of the

114

government's prevention and control measures on the infection rate,

115

then to obtain the optimal model of disease spreading and the most

116

effective prevention and control strategy. Based on the proposed

117

SIQR model, the hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model

118

embedded the genetic algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 in this

119

article, and it introduces the important prediction and control

120

strategies led by the government as well as the massive support

121

participation from the public into the prediction calculation process.

122

Furthermore, this article simulates the development of the epidemic

123

based on the proposed hybrid prediction model and predicts the trend

124

of the epidemic. Due to the fluctuation of virus detection capability,

125

the epidemic data of China shows a sudden change on February 12

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section “A

138

hybrid model of COVID-19 spreading dynamics” introduces the

139

framework of the proposed hybrid epidemic spreading model. Section

140

“Methods” explains the method of GA and ANN to predict epidemic

141

spreading. Section “Simulation results and discussion” provides the

142

simulation results based on the epidemic data of Brazil and gives

143

some discussion. The conclusions are provided at last.

144

A hybrid model of COVID-19 spreading dynamics

145

In this section, we establish a mathematical model on COVID- 19

146

based on some assumptions. There are some literatures proposed

147

models mainly based on real clinical data, predict and control

148

measures. In this paper, we modified the previous model proposed in

149

[18], and then extend the model structure by designing different

150

infection rate. The model network diagram and the interaction

151

individual components demonstrated in Fig 1. Every individual in

152

network can only exist one of four independent states, namely,

153

susceptible, infected, quarantined and recovered. For simply, it can

154

be denoted by S, I, Q, and R, respectively. Each link represents the

155

transformation relationship between nodes. Here, infected individuals

156

include symptomatic infected individuals and asymptomatic infected

157

individuals. Susceptible individual is infected with probability m (M1,

158

M2, M3 and M4) if it is connected to an infected individual. Infective

159

individuals are quarantined with probability α . In the process of

160

isolation, the asymptomatic infected individuals turn into symptomatic

161

infected individuals with the probability ω . Quarantined individuals

162

are treated with drugs that move into the recovered individuals with

163

probability β. Some recovered individuals will relapse into infection

164

due to their weakened immunity with probability γ. The probability of

165

death during isolation is λ. Here, set a switch of city lockdown by the

166

death rate, infection probability m is different based on the city

167

situation (lockdown or not). The lockdown infection probability m is

168

much lower for the strict government regulation.

(2)

178

In this paper, the proportion of death is a very important

179

parameter. It not only depicts the fatality rate of the disease in the

180

process of transmission, but also reflects the effectiveness of

181

prevention and control measures. For example, the money invested

182

by the government can improve the medical level and effectively cut

183

off the transmission route of the virus. Increasing publicity and

184

awareness of prevention and control will also reduce the risk of

185

infection. Law enforcement can also affect the spread of diseases,

186

such as city closures and home quarantine. This paper argues that

187

due to the strict control and isolation measures taken by the

188

government during the epidemic, the infected cases cannot infect

189

susceptible people after quarantine. However, asymptomatic infected

190

persons also have some ability to transmit, and it is difficult to detect.

191

Therefore, there is a certain relationship between the number of

192

newly infected cases on Day t and the number of infected cases in

193

the past k days. Moreover, the infection rate of patients is closely

194

related to the time of infection. Since government measures can

195

inhibit the spread of the disease, the infection rate of newly infected

196

cases may vary from time to time on t day over the past k days.

197

Further analyzing this difference and assigning different weights to

198

different measures, we quantified the contribution of different

199

measures to the infection rate at time t in newly infected cases. Then,

200

the weighted accumulation was used to estimate the infection rate so

201

as to establish the relevant epidemic air defense modeling.

202

In addition, in order to study the relationship between the

203

prediction and control measures with infection rate of the SIQR

204

epidemic spreading model, the method of GA and LSTM are used to

205

optimize the spreading model. This paper considers the relationship

between the rate of disease transmission and the measures taken by

207

the government against the disease. The main factors include

208

government investment, medical level, media publicity and law

209

enforcement. Firstly, genetic algorithm is used to estimate the

210

infection rate of the model, taking the acceptable mortality rate as

211

fitness function and taking it as a basis for city closure parameters. At

212

the same time, GA is further used to obtain the optimal means of

213

government control by taking the minimum mortality rate as fitness

214

function. The mutation law of GA is based on the interaction of four

215

government measures. Furthermore, the infection rate bias and

216

mortality bias were estimated through the LSTM network, the number

217

of infected people was estimated by combining with the SIQR model,

218

and the relevant parameters of the model were modified to obtain the

219

best transmission model and predict the spread of the disease. By

220

combining these two approaches, the optimal model of disease

221

spreading and the optimal prevention and control strategies can be

222

obtained, which can predict the number of infected and death cases

223

based on the spreading model and development trend. The proposed

224

framework is shown in Fig 2.

225

Methods

226

Epidemiological investigation and modeling are effective tools to

227

study the spread of epidemic diseases and have played their due

228

roles in the prevention and control of public health events with global

229

impact, such as SARS, MERS and H1N1 influenza. Many

230

researchers have also achieved some results in novel coronavirus

231

research using epidemiology and modeling analysis. The study of J.

232

Chan et al. [30] found the first evidence of human-machine

233

transmission. Then, some researchers combined with the analysis of

234

some early cases and gave the mean incubation period and mean

235

infection cycle of novel coronavirus. Traditional models of disease

236

transmission believe that the number of new infections is related to

237

the number of infected and vulnerable people, but these models lack

238

in-depth analysis of parameters in the process of disease

239

transmission.

240

implementation of different control measures has a great impact on

241

the prevention and control of disease and the suppression of disease

242

transmission. For example, the government's publicity of disease

243

prevention and control, the formulation of relevant laws and

244

regulations, financial investment and other measures can affect the

245

spread of disease. The study found significant differences in the rates

246

of infection among people of different ages. The main purpose of this

paper is to study the impact of government measures on the spread

255

Unlike the traditional SIQR epidemic spreading model, which

256

consists of a single infected rate to describe the probability of

257

infection. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic strategy to better

258

represent the real world and the new COVID-19 disease. It mainly

259

considers the impact of various measures taken by the government

260

on the control of disease spreading. This paper considers the impact

261

of government investment, media publicity, medical treatment and

262

law enforcement on the rate of disease spreading, and its parameters

263

are set as mi, i=1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. In addition, ki is the weight of

264

each measure. Thus, the rate of disease spreading can be written as:

m   ki mi

The GA is mainly used to optimize parameters of the model, it can

267

be divided as two parts, and the first part describes that using the GA

268

to optimize the conditions of city closure. First initialization model, set

269

the initial value, with acceptable mortality as a condition of judgment.

270

According to data analysis and relevant government regulations, a

271

three-day mortality rate greater than 0.045 is defined here as an

272

unacceptable mortality rate. When this unacceptable mortality rate is

273

reached, will update and save the neural network parameters, as a

basis for the sealing city.

Using twice the genetic algorithm, the approximate optimized

the government can be obtained. Further, the LSTM algorithm is

used to modify other parameters of the model, and the historical data

is compared with the data calculated by the model, such as the

number of infections and deaths, to determine whether the system

has reached the minimum error. The number of infections and deaths

are further predicted. The flow chart of COVID-19 prediction

305

In order to get a more accurate model, the model parameters

306

need to be further processed. The GA has optimized the weight

307

parameters in the neural network, and other model parameters are

308

optimized through the optimized neural network model. Here, LSTM

309

neural network is used to optimize the model parameters. We

310

collected historical data from February 26 to October 13 in Brazil, to

311

train neural network. Here we discussed the model parameters

312

through two judgments. First, when the mortality rate of the model

313

reaches an unacceptable mortality rate, the neural network

314

parameters of the closed city are used to process the system model

315

parameters, and then the mortality rate and infection rate are further

316

compared with the actual data. By obtaining the minimum model error,

317

the optimized model parameters are finally obtained. Here, let the

318

actual infected rate be ΔI and the infected rate under the regression

319

exponential function be Δ I’, and use the neural network to predict

320

the deviation between the actual mortality and the regressive

321

infection rate. Similarly, the same approach can be applied to

322

mortality and obtained ΔD and ΔD’. Assuming that B=ΔI’+ΔD’ is

the deviation characteristic of the prediction, the LSTM method can

be used to predict the model. The flow diagram of the prediction is

Simulation results and discussion

Based on GA in Fig 1, we computed the vulnerability coefficient ki of

335

four government measures. Without city lockdown, the infection

336

probability m of government investment, media publicity, medical

337

treatment and law enforcement are 0.174, 0.717, 0.021 and 0.853.

338

With city lockdown, the infection probability m of government

339

investment, media publicity, medical treatment and law enforcement

340

are 0.085, 0.219, 0.107 and 0.349. There are two significant

341

government measures media publicity and law enforcement, and the

342

law enforcement is more important. Make a globally observation,

most medical workers tried their best to save lives. The difference of

epidemic prevention results comes from the media publicity and law

346

enforcement. Enhancing the influence of media can build a strong

347

basis of epidemic prevention by offering the meaning of prevention

348

measures.

349

non-media audiences, the risk of disease spreading still exist. The

350

efficiency of law enforcement is the crucial insurance to save the

351

effort of medical workers.

Considering

the

exception

of

inconsiderate

and

352

We simulated the disease development and analyze the output of

353

the model in 231 days with real epidemic data available from Brazil

354

(February 26 to October 13). Fig 5a represents the number of

355

predicted and confirmed per days, the model predicts infected per

356

days of the last 17 days before October 13. Considering the lockdown

357

from March 21 to July 31, the government realized the necessity of

358

quarantine. From the data trend of infection confirmed per days over

359

this period, the law enforcement shows insufficient efficiency.

360

Supposing the government gave the best performance to control the

361

disease, we performed the simulation about the development of

362

infection and death per days. Fig 5b is the infected prediction with

363

best performance of government; the possible infected number would

364

much lower with effective government effort. With the comparison

365

between Fig 5a and Fig 5b, it is obvious that there is a great impact

366

on the prediction in the middle and later period due to the large

367

changes in the data after government make best moves. Fig 5c is the

368

daily-infected prediction error of model for last 17 days. Considering

369

the enormousness of infection confirmed number, Fig 5c shows the

performance, c) Infection prediction error.

376

To better understand the model performance, we simulated

377

deaths in Brazil. Fig 6a represents the number of new death cases

378

per day, this indicates that at the beginning of the epidemic, due to

379

limited understanding of disease transmission and limited detection

380

efforts, there will be omissions in disease statistics, leading to a

381

similar increase trend with the infected cases. Meanwhile, Fig 6a

382

represents the new predicted death cases per days of the last 17

383

days before October 13, which shows the difference with daily new

384

death cases. Fig 6b is the daily death prediction with best

385

performance of government. While the continuous improvement of

386

detection methods and the continuous promotion of detection scope

387

will be carried out, the government could strengthen the control of the

388

disease, so the daily death cases would gradually decrease. Fig 6c is

389

the daily death prediction error of model for last 17 days. Combine

390

Fig 6a, we can see that the LSTM method have a good performance

391

to predict COVID-19 disease. The method can predict the trend of the

392
393
394
395
396

disease over a longer period with the performance of government.

Conclusions

398

Based on the SIQR disease-spreading model, this paper seeks the

399

best government performance from the four aspects by GA; and then

400

proposed a hybrid prediction model with LSTM network. By analyzing

401

Brazil data from February 26 to October 13, we analyzed new

402

infected cases, new death cases per day. It is found that media

403

publicity and law enforcement have more contribution to reduce

404

transmission rate. With best government performance, the tread of

405

COVID-19 in Brazil could make a difference. The prediction results of

406

this model are highly consistent with the actual epidemic situation,

407

which proves that the hybrid model proposed in this paper can

408

efficiently analyze the transmission law and development trend of the

409

virus.
