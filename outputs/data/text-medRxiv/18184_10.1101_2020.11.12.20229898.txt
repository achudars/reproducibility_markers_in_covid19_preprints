Abstract
Background. South Asia has become a major epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding
South Asians’ awareness, attitudes and experiences of early measures for the prevention of
COVID-19 is key to improving the effectiveness and mitigating the social and economic impacts of
pandemic responses at a critical time for the Region.
Methods. We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of
29,809 adult men and women, at 93 locations across four South Asian countries. Data were
collected during the national lockdowns implemented from March to July 2020, and compared with
data collected prior to the pandemic as part of an ongoing prospective surveillance initiative.
Results. Participants were 61% female, mean age 45.1 years. Almost half had one or more chronic
disease, including diabetes (16%), hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Knowledge of the primary
COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes was high, but access to hygiene and personal
protection resources was low (running water 63%, hand sanitisers 53%, paper tissues 48%). Key
preventive measures were not widely adopted. Knowledge, access to, and uptake of COVID-19
prevention measures were low amongst people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups.
Fifteen percent of people receiving treatment for chronic diseases reported loss of access to longterm medications; 40% reported symptoms suggestive of anxiety or depression. The prevalence of
unemployment rose from 9.3% to 39.4% (P<0.001), and household income fell by 52% (P<0.001)
during the lockdown. Younger people and those from less affluent socio-economic groups were
most severely impacted. Sedentary time increased by 32% and inadequate fruit and vegetable
intake increased by 10% (P<0.001 for both), while tobacco and alcohol consumption dropped by
41% and 80%, respectively (P<0.001), during the lockdown.
Conclusions. Our results identified important knowledge, access and uptake barriers to the
prevention of COVID-19 in South Asia, and demonstrated major adverse impacts of the pandemic
on chronic disease treatment, mental health, health-related behaviours, employment and
household finances. We found important sociodemographic differences for impact, suggesting a
widening of existing inequalities. Our findings underscore the need for immediate large-scale
action to close gaps in knowledge and access to essential resources for prevention, along with
measures to safeguard economic production and mitigate socio-economic impacts on the young
and the poor.

Background
South-Asia is the most densely populated region of the world (1.9 billion people, 25% of global
population), with more than 98% of South Asians living in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan or Sri
Lanka. In common with residents of many other lower-middle income countries (LMICs), the
people of South Asia face multiple challenges, including high rates of both communicable and noncommunicable disease, fragile health and education systems, food and financial insecurity, and
limited formal economic or social support.[1,2] Together, these characteristics are anticipated to
make South Asian countries more vulnerable to major health and societal challenges such as
COVID-19.
The first case of COVID-19 in South Asia was identified in January 2020, shortly before COVID19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO.[3] In response, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka implemented a range of highly restrictive national control measures to reduce the spread of
COVID-19. This included closures of schools and non-essential workplaces, public transport bans,
education campaigns for individual level behavioural interventions, isolation of symptomatic
individuals, and contact tracing.[4,5] However, since then more than 7.4 million cases have been
detected,

with

over

116,500

deaths

(7th

October

2020,

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The rate of new infections is still rapidly accelerating
in India, which now has the second highest numbers of COVID-19 cases globally, indicating that
the control measures may have been less effective than in other settings. Furthermore, there is
increasing evidence that national lockdowns may have adverse effects for physical and mental
health, children’s education, behaviours relevant to chronic disease, as well as severe social and
financial consequences.[6–10] There is an urgent need to understand how control measures can
be further strengthened in South Asia, both to reduce the high rates of ongoing transmission, and
to mitigate their unintended adverse consequences.
We interviewed 29,809 people participating in a long-term South Asian health surveillance study
while restrictive national control measures were in place. We measured their knowledge of COVID19, adoption of preventive practices, and impact of COVID-19 on their physical and mental health,
health-related behaviours, non-communicable disease care, social circumstances, and economic
well-being. The ultimate goal of the study was to inform the design and implementation of further
COVID-19 prevention and control programs in South Asia.

Methods
We used our network of health surveillance sites to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on people
living in five study regions: Bangladesh, South India, North India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The
surveillance sites include 52,813 South Asian men and women aged 18 years and above with
comprehensive information on baseline health collected immediately prior to the COVID-19
pandemic (November 2018 to March 2020). We supplemented these baseline data with a
telephone interview focussed on COVID-19, which was completed by 29,809 of the surveillance

study participants, during the national lockdowns implemented between March and July 2020. The
study was approved by IRBs in each country, and consent was obtained from all participants for
each round of data collection.

Study settings and recruitment
Recruitment to our health surveillance study took place at 93 surveillance sites (range 2 to 33
per study region, 74% urban, Supplementary Table 1). Governmental census data and available
household listings were used, together with house-house visits by research teams and local
primary care workers, to identify (enumerate) the resident population. Resident adults (age 18
years and above) were invited to take part; exclusion criteria included current pregnancy, or
serious illness expected to reduce life expectancy to less than 12 months. We worked closely with
community senior members (e.g. teachers, employers, religious leaders) to support and facilitate
engagement in the study. Explanations of the project’s purpose were provided in writing and using
videos, in relevant South Asian languages, supported by bilingual translators. Recruitment started
in November 2018, and by March 2020 we had completed evaluation of 52,813 people
(Bangladesh: 13,955; North India: 9,469; South India: 8,621; Pakistan: 5,833; Sri Lanka: 14,935).

Baseline evaluation
An interviewer-administered health and lifestyle questionnaire was used to collect information
on behavioural risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity and consumption of
fruits/vegetables), personal and family medical history, medications, and socio-economic status.
Physical measurements included: a) Anthropometry (height, weight, waist and hip circumference
and bio-impedance for body fat composition); b) Blood pressure by Omron

digital device; c)

Cardiac evaluation by 12 lead ECG to identify arrhythmia, left ventricular hypertrophy and previous
myocardial infarction; d) Retinal photography for assessment of retinal disease, including
hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy; and e). Respiratory evaluation by spirometry to assess for
smoking/environment-related lung injury. Fasting glucose, and cholesterol were measured by point
of care tests. Aliquots of blood and urine are stored for future molecular analyses. Equipment,
protocols and training was standardised across sites.

Follow-up COVID-19 questionnaire
As part of an integrated effort, co-ordinated by the Wellcome Trust, we developed a
questionnaire aimed at assessing (i) prevalence, knowledge and uptake of behaviours relevant to
COVID-19; and, (ii) impact of COVID-19 on access to healthcare, behaviours linked to noncommunicable disease risk, social interactions and financial circumstances.[11] The questionnaire
is available in full on our study website (www.ghru-southasia.org). We implemented the
questionnaire by telephone during the national lockdown period, using a bespoke data capture tool
based on KoBoToolbox, an open source data collection software. The study team attempted to

contact all 52,813 participants of our surveillance study. Training for questionnaire administration,
and quality control of data collection were co-ordinated centrally.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are presented as mean (SD) or as % for continuous and categorical
variables, respectively. Participants were clustered geographically in surveillance sites. To account
for heterogeneity in outcomes between sites due to unobserved contextual factors, we used a
multilevel modelling regression approach with random effects (intercept) at the study site level to
quantify the relationships between outcomes and potential predictors such as age, gender,
education, prior income, and prior chronic condition. For analyses where the baseline (prepandemic) and follow-up (during the pandemic) data (e.g. behaviours linked with chronic disease
risk, social and financial circumstances) were available, we examined the changes between the
two time points. We conducted all analyses in STATA 15.
We analysed three groups of dependent variables: (i) COVID-19 burden, knowledge and
preventive behaviours of COVID-19, (ii) Impact of COVID-19 on chronic disease and behaviours
linked with chronic disease risk, and (iii) Impact of COVID-19 on social and financial
circumstances. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated from reported symptoms, such as
fever and cough; knowledge was tested for disease symptoms and transmission mechanism; and
preventive behaviours included washing hands, wearing masks, and following social distancing.
Impact on chronic disease included running out of routine medications, symptoms of psychosocial
distress (e.g. anxiety and depression), and risk factors for chronic conditions (e.g. alcohol drinking,
tobacco use, physical in activity, and unhealthy diet). Finally, impact on social and financial
circumstances included household income, employment, and working hours.

Results
Study population
The baseline characteristics of all 52,813 participants in our surveillance study are summarised
in Supplementary Table 2. Of these, 29,809 people successfully completed the COVID-19
questionnaire (Table 1, response rate 57%), with little evidence for responder bias
(Supplementary Figure 1). Participants were 61% female, mean age 45 years, and living in
Bangladesh (8,807), North India (6,152), South India (3,834), Pakistan (2,534) or Sri Lanka
(8,382). Almost half of participants had at least one chronic disease, including diabetes (16%),
hypertension (23%) or obesity (16%). Participants from South India and Sri Lanka were older, and
had higher prevalence of diabetes, compared to other settings (P<0.001). Cigarette smoking was
highest, whilst education and indicators of socio-economic status were lowest, in Bangladesh and
Pakistan (P<0.001). The ‘lockdown’ control measures for each country during the survey period
included major restrictions on movement outside the house, closure of schools and non-essential
workplaces, and cancellation of public and religious events (Supplementary Table 3).

COVID-19: burden, knowledge and preventive behaviours
Only 1.0% of people reported the combination of fever and cough during the study period, while
4.6% reported one or more of the recognised COVID-19 symptoms (Supplementary Table 4).
Testing rates were consistently low, with just 0.9% of people reporting having had a swab test for
COVID-19, including <10% of people with suggestive symptoms. People with known chronic
disease and with higher levels of education were 50% more likely to report suggestive symptoms,
even after adjustment age, gender, education and income status (P<0.01, Supplementary Table
5).
Awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, and of the pathways to transmission, was moderate to high
for the primary components (Supplementary Table 4). Fever and cough were recognised as
COVID-19 symptoms by 90.1% and 79.5% of people respectively. However only ~50% of people
recognised sore throat or breathlessness, and <25% tiredness, myalgia or gastrointestinal
disturbance, as being potential features of COVID-19. The proportions of people unaware that
COVID-19 transmission is facilitated by contaminated surfaces, or by touching the face were high
(45% and 33% respectively, Supplementary Table 4). Weaker knowledge of symptoms and
transmission was more common in women, and also strongly associated with lower levels of
education, lower income status and with increasing age (Supplementary Table 5; odds ratio for
weaker knowledge: 2.2 (95%CI: 1.9-2.4) for age >60 years, and 2.7 (95%CI: 2.4-3.3) for no formal
education, compared to youngest age group and highest education group respectively (both
P<0.001).
Knowledge of the personal preventive measures recommended to reduce transmission of
COVID-19 was high in all settings (>95% for most metrics, Supplementary Table 4). However,
implementation of these measures in daily life was only moderate, representing both environmental
and behavioural factors (Supplementary Table 4). Approximately 50% of people did not have
access to hand sanitisers or tissues, and 70% had no access to gloves. Almost 40% of participants
did not have access to clean running water in the home, and 59% did not have access to a room
that could be used for self-isolation of people with known or suspected COVID-19. In addition, 10%
of people reported not wearing masks or following social distancing when outside, 25% went
outside for non-essential reasons, and 75% of people continued to join meetings with people from
across different households. Poorer access to and implementation of preventive measures was 2.9
(95%CI: 2.6-3.1) fold more common amongst women compared to men, and also more common
amongst people from lower educational and financial backgrounds (all P<0.001; Supplementary
Table 5).

Impact of COVID-19 on chronic disease
Access to healthcare, including consultations, diagnostic tests and medications was
compromised in all settings during the implementation of control measures (Figure 1).

Approximately 24% of people were taking one or more regular medication, amongst whom 15%
reported running out of supplies. Drugs for diabetes and hypertension were most commonly
affected (61% and 44% respectively). Restrictions to movement and financial pressures were
identified as the primary reasons for impaired access to healthcare and medications
(Supplementary Table 6). The impact on access to medication was greatest in the young (OR
1.62 [95%CI:1.17-2.64] for age 18-29 years, vs age >60 years, P<0.001), in those with lower levels
of income (OR 1.41 [95%CI: 1.14-1.84] for bottom vs top quintile of income, P<0.001), and
education (OR 1.48 [95%CI: 1.12-2.19] for no vs 13+ years education, P<0.001), and 1.54 (95%CI:
1.12-1.95) higher amongst those with chronic disease (Supplementary Table 5).
COVID-19 also impacted behaviour patterns relevant to chronic disease (Figure 2). Physical
activity patterns deteriorated during the pandemic, with a 32% (from 3.8 hours to 5.0 hours)
increase in sedentary time, and there was a 10% (from 70% to 77.2%) increase in the proportion of
people reporting inadequate fruit and vegetable intake (both P<0.001). Respondents reported
weight loss in all study regions (average 3% from 62.5 kg to 62.1 kg, P<0.001). The deterioration in
diet and physical activity was most marked in men (Supplementary Table 5). Lower levels of
education were also associated with a greater negative impact of pandemic on physical activity,
but a lesser effect on diet (P<0.001). Self-reported alcohol intake fell by 80% (from 11.0% to 2.2%),
and smoking rates by 41% (from 24.4% to 14.5%) compared with pre-pandemic levels (both
P<0.001). Continued tobacco and alcohol consumption were more than five-fold higher in men
than women, while continued alcohol consumption was 1.7 fold (95%CI: 1.17-2.24) more common
in the most affluent quintile compared to the lowest quintile of income (both P<0.001). If the
reduction in cigarette smoking can be maintained long term, this might reduce the future risk of
CVD in the population by 13%, and of lung cancer by 25% (Supplementary Table 7). Almost 40%
of participants reported symptoms consistent with anxiety or depression (Figure 3). The
prevalence of anxiety and depression was higher in people aged 30-49 years, amongst people with
chronic disease, and in people with lower education and income (all P<0.05, Supplementary
Table 5).

Impact of COVID-19 on social and financial circumstances
The impact of COVID-19 control measures on employment and incomes was high. Compared
to pre-pandemic, the proportion of respondents unemployed increased 3.5 fold from 9.3% to 39.4%
(P<0.001). Time in work decreased by 29% (from 41.1 to 29.2 hours) while household monthly
income fell by 52% (from USD 240.0 to 114.4, P<0.001, Figure 4). The negative economic impact
was greatest among younger participants, and amongst people with lower income and educational
status at baseline (Supplementary Table 5). People with no formal education were 1.7 fold
(95%CI: 1.53-1.97) more likely to report loss of employment, and 3.2 fold (95%CI: 2.82-3.63) more
likely to report a fall in income, compared to the well-educated (both P<0.001). Almost 4% of
participants had to relocate during the lockdown; of these over 80% travelled over 100 miles to

their new location.

Social and financial support were heterogeneous across the regions

(Supplementary Table 3). More than 50% of people in Sri Lanka reported receiving financial
support (Supplementary Table 8). Support with supply of medications increased 45%, whilst
delivery of grocery shopping almost tripled, and access to subsidized food increased more than 6fold. Sri Lanka also had the lowest proportion of people reporting anxiety and depression. In other
settings there was little evidence of participants receiving support from state or community sources
(Supplementary Table 8).

Discussion
We assessed the knowledge, behaviours, health and socio-economic circumstances of 29,809
men and women, from 93 surveillance sites in four South Asian countries, during the national
lockdowns that were implemented for COVID-19 between March and July 2020. Our findings
provide a comprehensive assessment of the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic response
measures on the health and wellbeing of South Asian communities. We found that many South
Asians had poor access to essential resources for personal protection, and that uptake of
recommended preventive measures was low, especially among people from modest educational
and socio-economic backgrounds. We also found major negative impacts of COVID-19, and
pandemic response measures, on chronic diseases, mental health and household finances.
Access to healthcare for chronic diseases was compromised, including consultations, diagnostic
tests and medications. Employment, income, and working hours fell substantially in all settings,
and these were accompanied by a high prevalence of anxiety and depression. Younger people,
and people from lower socio-economic groups were impacted the most. Although tobacco and
alcohol consumption fell, so too did physical activity levels and fruit and vegetable intake. Our
findings identify factors likely to have fuelled the continued progression of COVID-19 in South Asia.
They also highlight the unanticipated, inequitable and unsustainable impacts of COVID-19, and
pandemic responses, on chronic disease management, mental health and socio-economic
circumstances. Our findings can inform the design of future policies aimed at preventing further
spread of COVID-19 in South Asia, and mitigating adverse socio-economic impacts, especially on
vulnerable population groups.

COVID-19: burden, knowledge and preventive behaviours
The prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms in the study population was low. Our results are
consistent with an assessment of flu-like symptoms amongst healthcare workers in India during the
same period,[12] but contrast with the findings of serology studies in Delhi and other urban South
Asian settings, which indicate a high proportion of the populations tested may have been infected
with COVID-19 during the lockdown.[13,14] These observations suggest that a high proportion of
people in South Asia may be infected asymptomatically, in keeping with the younger age
distribution of South Asian populations, compared to European or North American countries. A

high proportion of individuals with asymptomatic COVID-19 represents an additional barrier to the
identification and isolation of cases, underscoring the importance of molecular diagnostic assays.
We note that COVID-19 testing was low during the assessment period. Although testing capacity
has subsequently increased, there remain wide variations in availability, cost and uptake.
We found high knowledge for typical COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes, positive
attitudes towards preventive measures, and high adoption of hand washing with soap and water,
consistent with previous reports.[15–17] We found incomplete knowledge for atypical COVID-19
symptoms and transmission routes, and important failures in the uptake of protective measures, in
particular avoiding interactions between households and non-essential out-of-home activities. We
found that uptake of protective measures is inversely related to education and socio-economic
status, and also poorer amongst women and older people. A high proportion of respondents
reported their households do not have access to running water, or suitable spaces for selfisolation. Our observations can contribute to explaining a continued sustained spread of the
COVID-19 epidemic in some South Asian communities, and highlight the population groups that
may benefit the most from further awareness raising measures and improved access to personal
protection resources.

COVID-19, non-communicable disease and healthy behaviours in South Asia
Almost half of participants reported at least one non-communicable disease, most commonly
diabetes or hypertension, conditions known to increase morbidity and mortality from COVID19.[18,19] In keeping with this, COVID-19 symptoms were more common amongst South Asians
reporting a chronic condition. The well documented high burden of diabetes and hypertension in
South Asians is contributing to the high impact of COVID-19 in this population.[20,21]
Our study design, which includes an assessment of key social and health metrics both prior to
and during the pandemic, enables us to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare in different
population sub-groups. We found adverse impacts on routine clinical care for people with chronic
disease, reflecting a combination of reduced mobility, impaired supply of services, weakened
financial circumstances and avoidance of healthcare settings. The impact was greatest amongst
the more vulnerable in society, in particular those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Our
results expand the evidence base on the impacts of COVID-19 on access to healthcare in South
Asia,[22–25] making a strong case for measures to protect routine health services, increase the
use of digital platforms and provide medication support.[26]
Our baseline and follow-up data also enable an accurate assessment of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviours. We document a modest increase in inadequate fruit
and vegetable consumption, and a more substantial increase in physical inactivity. Previous
reports had shown increased carbohydrate consumption and snacking and reduced physical
activity amongst Indians with type-2 diabetes during the pandemic.[27] However, there were also
steep declines in smoking and alcohol consumption in most settings. If sustained, these might

translate into a substantial reduction in the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease
and lung cancer in the population. Understanding what drove the drop in tobacco and alcohol
consumption could support the development of new policies to maintain those improvements in the
future, but insights will also be needed to prevent further deterioration of diet and physical activity
patterns while pandemic response measures last, and to promote a return to healthy lifestyles as
measures are released.
We identified a high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the study period,
highest in Bangladesh. Symptoms of psychosocial distress were more common in women, and
amongst people with lower income and education. Our findings are consistent with others from
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan,[28] and emphasise the potential negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on mental health in South Asia, a region that has some of the highest suicide rates
globally.[29]

Impact of COVID-19 on social and financial circumstances
We found evidence of a high negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response
measures on social and economic circumstances in South Asia. We documented a substantial
increase in unemployment, decreased work hours and a major reduction in household income. The
adverse effects on financial circumstances were greatest for younger people, and those from less
educated backgrounds. Governments throughout the world have identified the risks to economic
wellbeing, and in many settings have implemented mitigation measures. Bangladesh re-opened
the garment industry after just one month of lockdown, while Sri Lanka implemented a national
financial support system and assistance with food supplies. However, these measures were
insufficient to mitigate the tremendous impact of COVID-19 control measures on economic
wellbeing. Our findings provide evidence of the scale of such impact for South Asian communities,
and a strong case for robust social, organisational and fiscal measures to avoid long-lasting
negative effects on the livelihoods of South Asian people.

Strengths and limitations
We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on behaviours, health, and wellbeing in a large
representative sample of South Asians from 93 sites across four countries. This brings precision
and generalisability to our findings. We benefited from the existence of comprehensive data from
participants collected just before the onset of the pandemic, enabling us to accurately assess
people’s changing situation. We used internationally validated questionnaires to ensure
comparability with other studies. Although we recognise that the use of telephone surveys may
introduce bias in recruitment, the characteristics of responders and non-responders were similar.
Telephone surveys may also lead to response bias, however reliable baseline data collected prepandemic provided opportunities for validation in several instances. Our study was carried out at
the height of the implementation of control measures, and restrictions have been eased in some

countries thereafter. However, our results provide objective evidence of the impact of control
measures on the population, and can inform the design and implementation of further local or
national restrictions, for COVID-19 or emerging viral pandemics.

Conclusions
Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of South Asian communities during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We found a low uptake of recommended preventive measures among
people from lower educational and socio-economic backgrounds, in women and in older age
groups, and poor access to the resources needed for personal protection. We also found negative
impacts of the pandemic on healthcare for chronic diseases, on diet and physical activity,
employment and personal finances, and mental health. Impacts have been unequal, with younger
people and people from lower socio-economic backgrounds impacted the most. Our results can
contribute to explaining the continued progression of COVID-19 in South Asia, and provide a basis
for the development of more effective, equitable and sustainable public health interventions for
COVID-19 in the region.
