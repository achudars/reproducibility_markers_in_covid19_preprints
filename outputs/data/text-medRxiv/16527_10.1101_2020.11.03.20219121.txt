Background: Since December 2019 the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the center of global
attention due to its rapid transmission and toll on health care systems and global economy.
Population-based serosurveys measuring antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 provide one method for
estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic.
Methods: In June 2020 we succeeded in testing almost half of the population of an Austrian
township (n=835 of 1359 inhabitants) with a reported higher incidence for COVID-19 infections.
We determined the level of prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population, factors affecting, and
symptoms correlated with prior infection.
Results: We found a high prevalence of 9% positive antibodies among the town population in
comparison to 6% of the neighboring villages. Only 20% of SARS-CoV-2 cases self-declared being
asymptomatic. In contrast, we identified six single major symptoms, including anosmia/ageusia,
weight loss, anorexia, general debility, dyspnea, and fever, and especially their combination to be
of high prognostic value for predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient. Our comparison of the
gold standard lab-based ELISA test and the on-site antibody test demonstrated a lack of accuracy
for the latter test form.
Conclusions: This population study demonstrated a high prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
as a marker of both active and past infections in an Austrian township. Several symptoms revealed
a diagnostic value especially in combination. Results from self-administered antibody tests should
be considered with caution.
The world is still in the midst of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic with Austrian towns as
Ischgl resembling as local epicenters. In June 2020 we succeeded in testing almost half of the
population (47%) of an Austrian township with a reported higher incidence for COVID-19
infections. We determined the level of prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population, factors
affecting, and symptoms correlated with prior infection. Execution and design of study was in
accordance with the local ethics committee and in approval by local and national authorities.
The township Weißenkirchen/Wachau (1359 inhabitants) is comprised of the town
Weißenkirchen (926), and the communities Wösendorf (296), Joching (150), and St. Michael (23).

People were recruited with a public call supported by local authorities as well as the Austrian red
cross. 835 participants were tested for specific antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2, with
uniformly distributed sexes (48% male) and comprising people of all ages (ranging from 7 to 89).
The participants completed a questionnaire on personal data as well as disease symptoms and their
onset and duration.
Blood samples were split and used for detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in
an onsite Rapid Test (WuHan UNscience Biotechnology) as well as in an certified diagnostic
laboratory (Bioscientia, Ingelheim, Germany) utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). The reference method for screening and diagnosing Covid-19 infection is RT-PCR,
nevertheless detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgM and IgA) play a
complementary role with particular importance in providing epidemiological information. (1)
Seroprevalence has been explored in Covid-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR, as recently
reviewed. (2) So far but only few studies have assessed seroprevalence in primarily asymptomatic
individuals. Numbers were overall low even among high risk groups healthcare workers with
frequent contact with Covid-19 patients ranging only at 1.6%. (3) In smaller studies in the general
population rates only up to 5% were discovered. (4)
Using the onsite COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test, 3.4% (28/835) and 0.2% (2/835) of all tested
subjects were shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, respectively. In contrast, in
8.5% (71/835) and 9.0% (75/835) of the tested subjects, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA
antibodies could be detected using the more sensitive and reliable laboratory-based ELISA assay.
Only 31% (22/71) of the IgG positives detected with the ELISA test could also be determined by
the IgG rapid test. Using the IgG ELISA data as the reference, we determined the test quality of
the IgG rapid test as follows: sensitivity: 31%, specificity: 99%, positive predictive value: 79%,
negative predictive value: 96%. The ELISA test is currently regarded as gold standard, therefore
for the further analysis only those subjects that tested IgG ELISA positive were regarded as
COVID-19 positive.
The high number of subjects with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies could be a hint of more
recent infections. (5) As the determination of IgA antibodies is far less reliable than for IgG, these
data must be treated with caution, and were not considered in the following evaluation.
People, which developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, stated significantly more often that
they stayed abroad or in the Austrian state of Tyrol (42%, 30/71), as compared to the total tested
population (26%, 206/806). Notably, the national hot spot Tyrol was not the source of the virus,
but rather other countries, most of all Israel. 53% (10/19) of people, which visited Israel in early
2020 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Thus, the virus most likely was introduced from
outside hotspots into the local population, where it proliferated.
9% (61/695) of the tested people from the township Weißenkirchen developed SARS-CoV-2specific IgG antibodies, in contrast to 6% (10/167) in the control group of tested people from
neighboring municipalities. Within the township Weißenkirchen, 10% (45/458) of the subjects

from the town Weißenkirchen and 38% (6/16) from St. Michael, but only 5% (6/114) from
Wösendorf and 6% (4/71) of Joching produced virus-specific antibodies. Thus, as expected, the
township Weißenkirchen was more affected by SARS-CoV-2 as compared to neighboring
municipalities, and that within the township the infection rates could be mainly localized to the
town Weißenkirchen and the community St. Michael.
54% (38/71) of subjects with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were male, as compared to 48%
(404/834) in the total tested population. From our data a higher vulnerability of the male
population as indicated by some studies is not evident. This however is in accordance with recent
epidemiological data from Asia and especially large population analysis in China. (6) Similarly, we
could not find a significant influence of age, body-mass index, or alcohol intake on the level of
infection within the tested population.
Smokers turned out to be underrepresented upon subjects with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.
8% of subjects with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies identified themselves as smokers, as compared to 17%
in the total population. Since this observation did not reach statistic significancy, it remains open
whether smoking may even reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Current data here suggest
that smokers are more vulnerable and that smoking is an predictor for a negative outcome but not
necessarily for a higher susceptibility to (asymptomatic) infection. (7)
20% (14/71) of all subjects which developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies self-declared having
noticed none of the 19 different disease symptoms listed in the questionnaire (Table 1). In
contrast, 80% (57/71) of subjects with virus-specific antibodies self-declared one or more disease
symptoms. Although some of these symptoms might be related to other diseases during the
evaluation period, our data suggest that asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are rather
uncharacteristic for the tested population. In fact, subjects with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies
self-declared to have significantly more disease symptoms during the evaluation period than
subjects lacking virus-specific antibodies (Table 1). Subjects having contact with SARS-CoV-2
demonstrated in a significant manner anosmia/ageusia, weight loss, anorexia, general debility,
dyspnea, and fever, as compared to the total tested population. More and larger samples here will
be necessary to confirm the prognostic values of symptoms found in other local studies. (8)
In this community-based SARS-CoV-2 population study in Austria we found a high prevalence of
9% positive antibodies among the town population in comparison to 6% of the neighboring
villages. Considering this large sample of almost half of the town population, we identified six
single major symptoms and especially their combination to be of high prognostic value for
predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient. Our comparison of the gold standard lab-based
ELISA test and the on-site antibody test demonstrated a lack accuracy for this test form. Results
from self-administered antibody test should be considered with caution. This study does have
limitations, selection bias cannot be ruled out due to the volunteer nature of the study. Therefore,
the estimated prevalence may be biased due to nonresponse or that symptomatic persons may
have been more likely to participate. Ongoing additional population tests and follow up test

currently dynamic pandemic situation.
