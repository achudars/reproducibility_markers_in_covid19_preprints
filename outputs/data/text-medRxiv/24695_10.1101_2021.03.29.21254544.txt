Abstract: In comparison to other European countries, during the first months of
COVID-19 pandemic, Poland reported relatively low number of confirmed cases of
severe

acute

respiratory syndrome

coronavirus 2

(SARS-CoV-2)

infections.

To

estimate the scale of pandemic in Poland, a serosurvey of antibodies against SARSCoV-2 was performed after the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe (March – May
2020). Within this study, we collected samples from July 28 to September 24, 2020
and based on the ELISA results, we found that 1.67% (25/1500, 95%CI 1.13 - 2.45) of
the Poznan (Poland) metropolitan area’s population had antibodies against SARSCoV-2 after the first wave of COVID-19. However, the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgG antibodies was confirmed with immunoblot in 56% (14/25) samples, what finally
resulted in decrease of seroprevalence, i.e. 0.93% (14/1500, 95%CI 0.56 - 1.56). The
positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG results were associated with age, occupation related to
constant

contact

with

people,

travelling

abroad,

non-compliance

with

epidemiological recommendations and direct contact with the novel coronavirus.
Our findings confirm the low SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Poland and imply that the
population had little herd immunity heading into the second and third wave of the
pandemic, and therefore herd immunity contributed little to prevent the high
numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 related deaths in Poland during
these subsequent waves.

1. Introduction
The emergence and rapid spread across the globe of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affected almost every part of our life. The
SARS-CoV-2

can

cause

the

coronavirus

diseases

2019

(COVID-19),

which

is

manifested by non-specific symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and rapid lack of
taste and smell. The symptoms can range from mild to severe illness (1,2). In some
cases, the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic (3). Due to the non-specific
symptoms or asymptomatic course of novel coronavirus infection, the diagnosis is
based on the detection of viral genetic material by the molecular techniques, i.e.,
reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) (4,5). Currently, the RT-PCR is a gold standard in
the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its high sensitivity and specificity,
internal controls of the reaction as well as possibility to run many samples at once
(6,7).
Based mostly on the RT-PCR results, from January 1 to December 31, 2020 the World
Health Organization reported almost 81.5 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2
infections and over 1.8 million deaths related to the virus worldwide (8,9). The most
affected countries with highest numbers of new SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID19 related deaths among European Union were Italy, Spain, France, Belgium and UK
(10,11). At the same time, Poland was hit by “two waves” of the pandemic, i.e. from
10.03.2020 to 20.04.2020 and from 04.10.2020 to 27.12.2020, with 1.3 million confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infections and 28.5 thousand deaths caused by the novel coronavirus
(12). Due to the political decisions to test only symptomatic patients (12), nonspecific
symptoms of COVID-19 (1,2), and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3), those
numbers may be underestimated.
The aims of the present sero-epidemiological study were to estimate the prevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of the Poznań metropolitan area

(Poland) after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, to find the risk factors
associated with COVID-19 and to compare the immunoassays used in detection of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study design and participants
We randomly selected and invited 1500 adult (over 18 years old) study participants
from approximately 15,000 volunteers living in the Poznań metropolitan area,
Poland, who answered the online epidemiological survey. The web-based survey
was opened for 5 days, i.e. 18-23.07.2020 and broadly advertised in local and national
newspapers, radio, TV, web portals as well as social media. Demographic data,
including

age,

gender

and

occupation

of

each

participant,

were

collected.

Additionally, we asked volunteers about their current health status, potential flu-like
symptoms in the last nine months and behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic,
namely compliance with epidemiological recommendations. To estimate the severity
of an individual’s flu-like symptoms, we developed a scoring system based on
subjects’ self-assessment answers. If the patient did not show any symptoms, a value
of 0 was assigned. Each symptom, such as fever, cough, runny nose, fatigue, muscle
and joint pain, sore throat, headache, diarrhea and loss of smell or taste, was rated as
1, and hospitalization due to the flu-like symptoms was rated as 5. Additionally, the
study participants were asked to compare flu-like symptoms in the last nine months
before the serological test to flu-like symptoms in the previous years. Symptoms of
flu-like illness in the last nine months milder than in the past were graded as 0, the
same as 3 and more severe as 5. Based on the total sum of values of individual
responses, study participants were divided into four groups: “asymptomatic” (0
points), “mild” (1–5 points), “moderate” (6–14 points) or “severe” (15–24 points). A
similar classification approach was implemented to assess individuals’ compliance
with epidemiological recommendations. If the study participant did not follow any
recommendations, a value of 0 was assigned. Each of the preventive measures, such

as face mask use, disinfection and social distance, remote work, avoiding contact
with other people, and avoiding the use of public transport, was rated as 1.
Depending on the total sum of values of individual responses, study participants
were divided into three groups: “non-compliant” (0 points), “at some point” (1–2
points)

and

“in

general”

(3–4

points)

compliant

with

epidemiological

recommendations.

2.2. Laboratory analysis
The blood samples were collected from individuals from July 28, 2020 to September
24, 2020 (Figure S1) at the Wielkopolskie Centrum Medycyny Podróży, Poznan, and
transferred to the IBCH PAS for analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies presence. In
case of ELISA positive results for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA or borderline
results for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, the study participants were asked to come again
within 2–3 weeks and a blood collection as well as an ELISA analysis were repeated.
For five study participants with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive results, we did the
follow-up analysis at 10 weeks after the first test.
The presence of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was determined using
anti-SARS-CoV-2

(EuroImmun) assays, respectively. The chosen immunoassays recognized specific
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the spike (S) protein and according to Beavis
and colleagues (13) demonstrates good and excellent specificity for IgA and IgG
antibodies, respectively. All anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive-samples were confirmed
with quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoblot (Polycheck), which uses the S
protein and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (PNC) as antigens.

differences between groups were analyzed with Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis
tests. All statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad Prism 9 software.

2.4. Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at the Poznan University of
Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland (Resolution No. 470/20 from 17th June 2019). In
addition, written informed consent was obtained from 1500 study participants before
the blood collection.

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of study participants
The study group included 1500 adults without any flu-like symptoms at the
sampling time and consisted of 896 (59.7%) female and 604 (40.3%) male subjects at
mean age 38.7 ± 12.7 years old (Table 1). Within the volunteers, 964 (64.2%) did not
report any chronic diseases, while 536 (35.8%) study participants were treated due to
the chronic diseases, such as hypertension, asthma, Crohn disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, diabetes, depression. (Table 2). In the last 9 months before the serological
tests, 1240 (82.7%) study participants reported flu-like symptoms, i.e., fever, cough,
fatigue, muscle and joint pain, etc. (Table 2), mostly with mild (454/1240, 36.6%) and
moderate (720/1240, 58.1%) severity. In addition, 356 (23.7%) of volunteers with flulike symptoms in the 9 last months before blood collection or with potential contact
with SARS-CoV-2 infected person, were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and
7 (1.9%) got the positive result (Table 1). Most of study participants (96.9%) followed
the epidemiological recommendations, i.e., wearing mask covering nose and mouth,
keeping social distance and often hand disinfection. Only 40 (2.7%) individuals had
known contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected person, while majority, i.e., 1085 (72.3%)
study participants hadn’t known about such situations (Table 3).

In total, 25 of 1500 (1.67%) collected samples were found to be positive for anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG antibodies by the ELISA (Table 1). Simultaneously, 60 of 1500 (4.0%)
collected samples were found to be positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies, but
in any of those cases, we did not observe IgA to IgG seroconversion (data not
shown). There were no significant differences in seroprevalence between the weeks
when the blood was collected (data not shown). We did not observe the significant
differences in the seroprevalence within gender (Table 1). The differences in the antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies presence were found among group at different age (Table 1)
and with different health status (Table 2). Based on the ELISA results, the highest
seropositivity was found among people over 65 years old, and study participants
with respiratory system chronic diseases (Table 2).
The antibodies against the novel coronavirus were found in only 3 (42.9%) and 8

3.3. SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors
One of the highest anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was found among study
participants who travelled abroad in the last 9 months before serological tests (Table

3.5. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies level
With quantitative immunoblots, we were able not only to confirm the ELISA results,
but also to analyze the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylated nucleoprotein
(PNC) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies. We found different levels of
analyzed antibodies among study participants, as shown in Figure 1a. In addition,
the anti-SARS-CoV-2 PNC and anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies level differed within
the same samples. Due to the low number of positive individuals, we did not
correlate the antibodies level with previously mentioned parameters, i.e., age,
gender.
With five study participants we performed follow-up study and analyzed the level of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 10 weeks after the first blood collection. As shown in
Figure 1b, we did not observe any significant differences, but in 4 of 5 samples we
reported slight decrease in the antibody level. For one sample, we found an increase
in anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies level (Figure 1b).

4. Discussion
For many months, the reported novel coronavirus infection cases and COVID-19related mortality in Poland were among the lowest in Europe (8,9,11,12). For
example, on 1 October 2020, there were 2,469.99 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and
67.20 COVID-19-related deaths per 1 million of citizens, but at the same time, in
Spain and Germany there were 16,652.99 and 3,527.39 confirmed infections and
683.84 and 113.49 deaths per 1 million of citizens, respectively (8,9). Those differences
may be explained by the early implementation of public health measures in Poland,
such as the closing of primary schools and the so-called deep lockdown in March and
April 2020, just after the first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, the
discrepancies in the novel coronavirus cases between Poland and other comparable
European Union members may result from the number of performed diagnostic
tests. In example, at the beginning of October 2020, an average of 22,125 tests were
performed per day in Poland. In comparison, there were 679,134 and 1,123,823 tests
performed daily in Spain and Germany, respectively (14). Finally, the differences in
pandemic scale between Poland and other countries may be due to the political
decisions to test only symptomatic patients (12) and the lack of free tests for the
presence of novel coronavirus for general population. This excludes individuals with
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection from official statistics and does not prevent
emergence of new epidemic foci, since the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected
persons still can infect others (3,15,16). And according to our results, as well as data
presented by others, the asymptomatic rate can range from 20% to up to 80% (17,18).
All above mentioned reasons may cause that the official numbers of SARS-CoV-2
infections are underestimated.

The estimation of scale of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as objective comparison of
different populations, can be done by the sero-epidemiological studies. Our data
demonstrates low (0.93%) seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in general
population of Poznan metropolitan area. Poznan is one of the biggest cities in Poland
with almost 1 million inhabitants and therefore may represent the situation in other
Polish metropolitan and big cities, which in total represents approximately 30% of
the society. However, it should be noted that the seroprevalence can differ in smaller
cities and villages, due to among others the lower access to health care system and
diagnostic centers, as shown by others (19,20). Based on our results of anti-SARSCoV-2 seroprevalence, i.e. 0.93%, demographic data, i.e. 3.50 million of citizens and
numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections presented by the Polish Ministry of
Health, we calculated that in September 2020, just before the so-called second wave
of pandemic, approximately 4-fold more infections occurred than were reported by
the government, i.e. 32,550 SARS-CoV-2 infections based on the seroprevalence vs.
7,985 COVID-19 cases from official statistics. These discrepancies may result from the
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, as mentioned above, reluctance to coronavirus
diagnostic tests, which are potentially linked with mandatory 10 days of quarantine.
The hesitation in testing might result from the lack of

trust for the healthcare

workersin the Polish society. Based on the YouGov data, in case of the ongoing
pandemic, the Poles trust the most family and friends, in contrary to other European
nations who ranked medical experts as the most trusted (21).
In comparison to Poznan, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence at similar time points,
in other metropolitan cities were higher, i.e., in Madrid, Spain, was equal to 13.6%
(22); in Geneva, Switzerland, it was 10.8% (23), and in Tehran, Iran, it was 16.3% (20).
This situation ensured that as of September 2020, the Polish population remained
largely immunologically naïve to the virus. The low seroprevalence in Poland
highlights also the importance of the vaccination against COVID-19. It is estimated,
that the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be stopped with 60-70% of the

population being vaccinated (24). It is impossible and extremely dangerous to reach
this level of herd immunity based on the SARS-CoV-2 infections.
In addition to the estimation which percentage of Poznan metropolitan area citizens
underwent novel coronavirus infection, we found the SARS-CoV infection risk
factors in Polish population. Namely, contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals,
age over 65 y.o., non-compliance with epidemiological recommendations, travelling
abroad and occupation related with constant contact with people (i.e., physicians,
nurses) are linked with higher seroprevalence. Our data confirmed previously
published results (19,25).
Moreover, it should be noted that besides many strengths, such as relatively big
group of study participants and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection with two
independent techniques, our study has some limitations. First of all, we observed
overrepresentation of woman in the study, i.e., 59.7% vs. 51.5% in the Polish
population, probably due to higher willingness to participate in online surveys (26).
However, since we did not detect significant differences in the seroprevalence among
gender, this fact should not bias the final results. In addition, the individuals
travelling abroad was also overrepresented in the study. According to the Polish
Tourism Organisation, 54% of the Polish population went for some vacations, and
18.3% of them travelled abroad in 2019 (27). This fact may lead to some bias and
overestimation of the seroprevalence.On the other hand, there is underrepresentation
of study participant over 65, i.e., 5.1% vs. 22% in Polish society. This fact can be
explained

technology (28). In addition, there were many volunteers, who wanted to participate,
but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, high risk of severe COVID-19 in this age group,
and recommendation to stay at home and isolate from others, they cancelled the
meetings and were replaced by next random person from the list. Finally, our results
can be bias due to the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests. Currently, it was
published that many serological tests, including EuroImmun ELISA used in our
study, cannot detect the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at low levels, characteristic for

so-called non-responders (29). This might explain why we did not detect the
antibodies in 4 of 7 study participants with positive results of RT-PCR test. The
problem with specificity of serological tests was observed also by us in case of antiSARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies. In any case of individuals with positive result of IgA
antibodies, we did not observed seroconversion. The false positive results of the
presence of IgA antibodies were mostly correlated with allergies, which was not
described by the manufacturer. It should be also highlighted that ELISA is a very
good screening method, but the results should be confirmed by immunoblot. As
shown in our study for the first time, the ELISA false positive signals can be as high
as almost 50% of all positive results.

5. Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrate the anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies seroprevalence in the general population in Poland after the first wave of
COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings confirm the low SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Poland
probably due to the effectiveness of early countermeasures. However, based on the
seroprevalence of 0.93%, it should be noted that the official numbers of novel
coronavirus infections were underestimated and the approximately 4-fold more
infections occurred than were reported by the Polish Ministry of Health. The low
anti-SARS-CoV-2

seroprevalence

implies

that

the

population

had

little

herd

immunity heading into the second and third wave of the pandemic, and therefore
herd immunity contributed little to prevent the high numbers of SARS-CoV-2
infections and COVID-19 related deaths in Poland during these subsequent waves.
Finally, taking into account all above mentioned limitations of our study, the
obtained seroprevalence may be underestimated. Therefore, further studies on the
SARS-CoV-2 burden in Poland are needed.
