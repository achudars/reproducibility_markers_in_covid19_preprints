Abstract
Background: Reducing contacts is a cornerstone of containing SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated
the effect of physical distancing measures and of school reopening on contacts and
consequently on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Brussels, a hotspot during the second
European wave.
Methods: Using SARS-CoV-2 case reports and contact tracing data during August-November
2020, we estimated changes in the age-specific number of reported contacts. We associated
these trends with changes in the instantaneous reproduction number Rt and in age-specific
transmission-events during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region. Furthermore,
we analysed trends in age-specific case numbers, pre- and post-school opening.
Findings: When schools reopened and physical distancing measures relaxed, the weekly
mean number of reported contacts surged from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) to 3.04 (95%CI 2.933.15), increasing across all ages. The fraction of cases aged 10-19 years started increasing
before school reopening, with no further increase following school reopening (risk ratio 1.23,
95%CI 0.79-1.94). During the subsequent month, 8.9% (67/755) of infections identified were
from teenagers to other ages, while 17.0% (131/755) from other ages to teenagers. Rt peaked
mid-September at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63). Reintroduction of physical distancing measures
reduced reported contacts to 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91), resulting in Rt dropping below 1 within
3 weeks.
Interpretation: The second pandemic wave in Brussels was the result of increased contacts
across all ages following school reopening. Stringent physical distancing measures, including
closure of bars and limiting close contacts while schools remain open, reduced social mixing,
in turn controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Introduction
Belgium has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country reported the
highest number of deaths per capita and near highest number of cases per capita worldwide.
During Europe’s ‘second pandemic wave’ the country was again the worst-affected country in
Europe in per capita case numbers and deaths1. Belgium loosened physical distancing
measures at a moment when case numbers were rising2. Brussels, Belgium’s capital, was
ahead of the rest of Belgium to observe a steep increase in cases and to step up preventive
measures3.
These interventions, involving physical distancing measures, target the reduction of person-toperson contact in order to reduce the number of occasions a virus can be transmitted. While
close-contact interactions are considered to play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission,
infection rates are generally assumed to proportionally in- or decrease with changes in (agespecific) number of contacts4. Hence, previous modelling studies estimated the effect of
physical distancing by evaluating the impact of changes in the general population’s contact
patterns on R0 during and post lockdown5,6.
In this study, using operational data, we describe the effect of physical distancing measures
and the closure of schools on contact patterns and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analysed
trends in reported contacts during distinct intervention periods in the Brussels region, and
associated these trends with estimated transmission patterns, and age-specific case numbers
over time during Brussels’ second pandemic wave.

Methods
We used data generated by the test and contact tracing system of the Brussels region between
1 August and 12 November 2020, to deduct contact and transmission patterns, and official
data on COVID-19 case reports for Brussels made available via the Belgian institute for health,
Sciensano, to assess age-specific trends in case numbers3.
Data processing
In May 2020, Belgium implemented a phone- and field agent-based contact tracing system.
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases and their contacts were identified and requested to selfisolate. High-risk (close) contacts, defined as physical or cumulative 15 minutes non-physical
contact within 1.5m from 2 days before to 7 days after onset of symptoms of a confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 case, were recommended to undergo SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, regardless of
symptoms. For contacts aged 0-6 years, and from October 21 onwards across all ages, testing
was restricted to symptomatic individuals only7. In primary schools, pupils and teachers in the
same class of a confirmed case were considered low-risk contacts, therefore did not require
testing, except if presenting symptoms. In secondary schools, the regular high-risk contact
definition and testing criteria are applied. Pseudonymised data on SARS-CoV-2 contacts
generated by the contact tracing system were linked to SARS-CoV-2 case data (including age)
using a unique identifier based on first and last name. Homonyms that resulted in duplicates
with the same unique identifier were excluded from the dataset. Hence, we identified contacts
that tested SARS-CoV-2 positive within 3 weeks after the reported date of contact with an
index case, generating a database with transmission events between primary (index) and
secondary cases (contacts).
We identified when changes in physical distancing measures were introduced by the national
and regional governments, distinguishing six distinct time periods with different combinations

of physical distancing measures and school closure, which we refer to as intervention periods
(Table 1).
Data analyses
Changes in contact patterns over time
We computed the mean number of contacts reported per case per week, overall and by age
group. We compared differences in sample mean and confidence intervals for weekly contacts
at the start and end of each intervention period assuming normality after visual inspection. To
visualise and describe changes in daily contact patterns over time, we fitted a segmented linear
regression allowing for a step and slope changes between distinct intervention periods (Supp
material).
Transmissibility as well as contact patterns are known to vary by age. The age of contacts was
only limitedly listed. Hence, we were unable to construct social contact matrices, capturing
contact patterns between age-groups. Social contract matrices with a per contact infectivity
value (often denoted as q) allow for calculation of the next generation matrix (NGM) describing
the number of potential transmission events per individual per age group. The dominant eigen
value of this NGM gives an estimate of the basic reproduction number R0 as a metric for
transmission4, and has previously been used as a metric to assess the impact of changes in
physical contacts5,6.
As alternative, we characterised changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission over time, by
estimating the non-age specific instantaneous reproduction number Rt , i.e. the mean number
of secondary cases that would arise from a primary case on a given day, during our study
period. Employing established methods8, we derived Rt from the daily number of reported
cases, assuming an uncertain serial interval distribution (i.e. drawn from multiple truncated
normal distributions with mean 5.19 days, 95%CI 4.37-6.02)8,9. We set a seven-day sliding
window; bootstrapping was used to obtain robust confidence intervals. The impact of changes
in contact patterns was estimated by quantifying the relative change in Rt.
Impact school opening
To further investigate the impact of changes in contact patterns on SARS-CoV-2 transmission
dynamics, we quantified the relative frequency of transmission events between age groups
over time. We extended the period to 30 November, to allow for the evaluation of transmissionevents after the extended autumn holidays. We characterised the (change in) degree of intraand intergenerational transmission events during periods where contact patterns changed,
including post-opening of schools.
Finally, we describe changes in the proportion of daily reported cases among secondary
school-aged children (10-19 years old) in the months pre- and post-school opening (August to
September), comparing segmented and non-segmented Poisson regression models (Supp
material). We hypothesised that, if secondary schools acted as a predominant driver of SARSCoV-2 transmission during Brussels’ second wave, the fraction of 10-19 year olds among all
reported cases would change first following school opening, before extending to other
generations. We adjusted the periods for reporting delays by including a lag between exposure
and case report (4 days) and compared model fits based on AIC assuming different time trends
following school opening.

Results
From 1 August to 12 November 2020, the Brussels region reported 63,838 SARS-CoV-2
confirmed cases (5.2% of its population) from 415,412 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests performed.
The daily number of confirmed cases peaked on October 20 with 2,950 cases reported (figure
1). SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was highest among 20-29 years olds (7.4%, 13,436/181,940),
and decreased with age, with 4.3% positive (4,913/114,637) among 70+ year olds (Supp Fig
1). A total of 52,484 cases were referred for contact tracing. Among these cases, 24,166
(46.0%) reported at least one contact, 61,754 in total. Matching operational case and contact
databases resulted in a final 19,194 cases with recorded age and 51,177 contacts. The time
between the last reported contact and contact tracing was median 2 days (interquartile range
0-5 days). Until 30 November, we traced back 2,443 reported contacts that tested SARS-CoV2 positive within 3 weeks, yielding primary-secondary case pairs, 2,387 with age recorded.
The effect of physical distancing measures on the number of reported contacts
August saw a wide variation in the number of reported contacts per case and the percentage
of cases reached compared to the following months (Supp Fig 2). September noted a
significant increase in the mean number of reported contacts, from 2.01 (95%CI 1.73-2.29) in
the last week of August pre-school opening (period 1), to 2.83 (95%CI 2.59-3.06) in the first
week of September (period 2, Fig 2, Supp Fig 2). We found no change in the number of
reported contacts when the restriction on the number of close contacts was suspended on
September 30 (period 3), plateauing at mean 3.04 (95%CI 2.93-3.15). In the fourth intervention
period, involving the restriction to 3 close contacts and the closure of bars on October 6 and 8,
resulted in a gradual 21% decrease in reported contacts from mean 2.81 (95%CI 2.74-2.89) in
the first week to 2.21 (95%CI 2.16-2.25) before contacts were further limited on 26 October. A
week into the 5th period with a limit of one close contact and a closure of restaurants and sports
facilities, a further decrease was observed to 1.94 reported contacts (95%CI 1.90-1.99), i.e.
45% decrease compared to September 30. When also shops were closed, telework became
mandatory, and schools started the autumn break, the mean number of reported contacts
stabilised at 1.85 (95%CI 1.78-1.91).
10-19 year olds reported overall the highest number of contacts during our study period (3.11,
95%CI 3.01-3.21); adults aged 70+ years reported the lowest number (2.05, 95%CI 1.93-2.18).
However, over time, changes in the number of contacts following changes in physical
distancing measures were similar across age-groups (Fig 2).
Effect of the number of reported contacts on SARS-CoV-2 spread
Rt ranged from 1.66 (95%CI 1.36-1.93) on August 2 to 0.56 (95%CI 0.50-0.62) on 11
November. Rt peaked September 17, at 1.48 (95%CI 1.35-1.63) following the SeptemberOctober surge in case numbers (Fig 3). After the limitation to 3 contacts and closure of bars
(periods 4), Rt decreased with 42% to 0.82 (95%CI 0.79-0.85) before the extended autumn

holidays, i.e. the first week into the period of a further limit to one close contact, closure of
restaurants and sport facilities (period 5), dropping below 1 on 29 October.
Age-specific transmission patterns
Among 2,387 identified primary-secondary case pairs, transmission within the same age group
(33.0%, 797/2,387) was predominant across age groups throughout all time periods. From
November 4 onwards, after introducing stringent physical distancing measures and during the
extended autumn holidays, intrageneration transmission was highest at 39% (63/160).
Infections from 10-19 year olds were seldom recorded in August and November when schools
were closed, but testing of this group was low at these times as well (Fig 4, Supp Fig 3). After
schools reopened, transmission between all age-groups became more apparent, reducing
again after November 4, which saw relatively more transmission-events within older agegroups (50+). Furthermore, in the month after reopening schools, 8.9% (67/755) of infections
were from 10-19 year olds to other age groups and 17.0% (131/755) from other age groups to
10-19 year olds.
Age-specific trends in SARS-CoV-2 reported cases
Up to October 20, a notable increase in reported SARS-CoV-2 was observed among 10-19
year olds (Figure 1B), coinciding with a testing rate increase in this age class over time
(spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.74, p-value<0.000, Supp Fig 2). At the time schools
reopened (1 September), we observed no significant change in the fraction of 10-19 year olds
among all diagnosed cases (risk ratio 1.23, 95%CI 0.79-1.94, Supp Fig 5). When asymptomatic
contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 testing (October 21 onwards), the fraction of 10-19
year olds fell from 16.9% of the cases (3478/20,535 during 2 preceding weeks) to 9.9%
(2214/22,330 during 2 following weeks, Fig 1B). The fraction of adults aged 70 or more, who
tested positive, increased by mid-October, from 5.2% (727/13872) during the two first weeks
of October to 13.8% (1574/11430) in the first two of November (Fig 1B).

Discussion
September 2020 saw a persistent increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the Brussels region
following increased social mixing across all ages. Stringent physical distancing measures were
introduced one month after an alarming persistent increase in Rt (6 October). These initial
measures (a limit to three close contacts, a curfew, a closure of bars, and recommended
teleworking) reduced reported contacts to less than two after three weeks (a 45% decrease),
resulting in an Rt <1 on 29 October. This suggests stringent physical distancing measures can
sufficiently reduce social mixing to control transmission, even without closing schools or full
lockdown.
In contrast to the first pandemic wave, schools remained open throughout the second wave.
There is general consensus that children attending primary school contribute little to
transmission10,11. In contrast, the role of teenagers and secondary schools is still much
debated12. Teenagers can transmit and show comparable viral load to adults13. Nonetheless,
several studies indicated either lower susceptibility or a higher proportion of asymptomatics
among children which might result in fewer secondary infections from younger individuals11,14–
16
. Modelling studies investigating the role of secondary schools have shown school closures
can help alter transmission-dynamics – albeit insufficiently for control and based on data from
the first months of the pandemic with limited preventive measures in schools 16. Others
described transmission in schools, although without considering its potential contribution to
SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the general population17,18. Our findings confirm transmission

among and from teenagers, with intergenerational transmission apparent following school
opening. Nonetheless, their relative role was limited: transmission events from 10-19 year olds
to other age groups remained inferior compared to those from adults when schools were open,
and the fraction of cases among 10-19 year olds did not significantly change after school
reopening. This was at a time testing among teenagers was extensive, reducing the likelihood
of their infections remaining undetected. An increase preceding school reopening was largely
explained by an increase in testing rates among this population (Supp Fig 3).
After school reopening, the number of reported contacts increased across all age groups.
Transmission among same-age groups predominated, in line with extensive contact tracing
and testing data from India19, which was related to both a higher frequency of contact and a
higher per-contact probability of infection with individuals of a similar age19,20.
With testing and contact tracing overwhelmed by increasing case numbers, testing and tracing
become nearly ineffective in outbreak control21. Physical distancing measures are then an
effective yet costly intervention to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission22–24. In Brussels, even
though epidemic growth could be slowed within three weeks through physical distance
measures, reducing case numbers to such extent to allow effective testing and tracing proved
to take longer. Planned, short periods of strict measures, so-called precautionary breaks, have
been proposed as a more effective and less costly tool to control SARS-CoV-2 spread25.
We found epidemic growth to be delayed among older adults, similar to observations in other
European countries, including Spain and the UK26,27. From October 15 onwards, the fraction
of older adults among SARS-CoV-2 cases in Brussels started to increase (Fig 1B). The change
in testing strategy excluding asymptomatic contacts from testing from October 21 can only
partially explain this shift. The proportions of asymptomatic infections differ, but not to such
extent between older and younger age groups15. SARS-CoV-2 transmission has shown to vary
between age-groups and settings, revealing so-called superspreading events28–30. Individuals
with social networks less linked to the general population, such as older adults – nursing home
residents in particular – can disproportionately increase when a certain threshold of infections
is reached in the general population31. This so-called percolation phenomenon may explain
why older adults were less affected before the epidemic peak, but increased in case numbers
thereafter. This emphasizes the importance of testing, and soon vaccinating, key persons that
are likely to link older frail adults to the overall population, e.g. nursing home staff or healthcare
workers.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the role of physical distance measures on
social mixing and SARS-CoV-2 control during the second pandemic wave in Europe, using
operational data. Because testing was extensive across all ages except 0-6 year olds, including
high-risk contacts with asymptomatic infections, age-specific transmission patterns are more
robust than during the first months of the pandemic. Some precaution is warranted though
when interpreting our findings. First, the number of high-risk contacts reported by cases in our
study was lower (mean 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.0, in August) than what participants in a social mixing
survey in Belgium reported (mean 3.5 during 27 July-10 August)5. This can partially be
explained by limited recording or re-calling of low-risk contacts or context-specific accidental
social contacts (e.g. public transport, bars), or could relate to individuals being reluctant in
reporting all contacts. Yet, age-specific differences were comparable, suggesting our
conclusions relying on reported trends over time, remain valid.
Linkage of contacts and cases resulted in a low fraction of cases that where a known contact,
indicating high volumes of undetected transmission. National identification number based

matching could have improved our linkage, but was only well recorded during periods of lower
case volumes. Importantly, our cross-generation transmission events during November,
coincided with a shift in testing to symptomatic cases as well as involvement of school doctors
in contact tracing. With children and teenagers more frequently presenting without or with mild
symptoms32,33, their lower involvement in transmission events during the period of an extended
school holiday should be considered with care. This shift in testing could have resulted in an
underestimation of Rt at the end of October. However, Rt continued to steadily decrease after
the testing strategy change, suggesting a true drop in transmission-levels is likely.
In conclusion, using operational case and contact tracing data, we were able to evaluate the
effect of physical distancing measures and school reopening on trends in age-specific contact
patterns and SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. The intensity of the second pandemic wave
in Brussels was a result of increased social mixing across all ages in absence of strict physical
distancing measures. Reopening of schools coincided with an increase in SARS-CoV-2
transmission. Nonetheless, our data suggests this is likely the result of increased social mixing
across all ages, rather than driven by SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children or teenagers,
followed by spreading to other ages. Physical distancing measures, including a closure of bars
and limiting close contacts, resulted in a rapid decrease in the reported number of contacts,
which in turn led to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Supplementary material
Description of regression models
To visualise and describe changes in contact patterns over time, we fitted a segmented linear
regression allowing for step and slope changes between distinct intervention periods as
follows:
𝑌𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑡−2 + 𝛽2𝑖 𝑋t + 𝛽3𝑖 𝑋𝑡 𝑇𝑡−2 + 𝜖𝑡

(1)

Where Yt is the expected mean number of contacts on day t. Tt represents the day starting
August 1, thus 𝛽1 can be interpreted as the underlying trend in contact patterns without any
changes in interventions. 𝑋𝑡 represents a dummy variable indexing the 6 distinct intervention
periods i, with 𝛽2 and 𝛽3 representing the step and slope change in contacts following the
introduction of interventions. We added a 2-day lag for delay between an at risk contact and
reporting of that contact, based on the median number of days between the last reported
contact and contact tracing.

We describe changes in the proportion of daily reported cases (𝐼t10−19 ) among teenagers in the
months pre- and post-school opening (August to September), using Poisson regression with a
log-link and offset term representing the total daily reported cases.
log (𝐼t10−19 ) ~ log(𝐼𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ) + 𝛽0 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝑡−4 + 𝛽3 𝑋𝑡 + 𝛽4 𝑋𝑡 𝑇𝑡−4 + 𝛽5 𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡10−19 + 𝛽6 𝑋𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑑

(2)

Tt represents the days from August until September, capturing the underlying trend pre-school
opening, 𝑋𝑡 represents a dummy variable indexing 0 and 1 before and after school opening
respectively. We adjusted the periods for reporting delays by including a lag between exposure
and case report (4 days). The daily number of tests performed among teenagers was
accounted for and depicted by 𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡10−19 as well as whether the case was reported positive
during the weekend 𝑋𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑑 . We compared model fits using Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC), assuming different time trends following school opening (i.e. no, vs a step vs a step and
slope change). Models with and without adjustment for school provided similar fits (AICs of
364.9, 363.1, and 362.4 for a model with a step and slope change, a step change only and no
change at all respectively). Of note, models with and without testing showed similar fits, while
𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡10−19 proved highly correlated with time.
