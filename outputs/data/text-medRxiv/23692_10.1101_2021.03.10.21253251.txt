Abstract
Several systemic factors indicate, that worldwide herd immunity against COVID-19
will probably not be achieved in 2021. Vaccination programs are limited by availability of doses, the number of people already infected is still too low to have a disease
preventing impact and new emerging variants of the virus seem to partially neglect developed antibodies from previous infections. Nevertheless, after one year of COVID-19
observing high numbers of reported cases in most European countries, we might expect that the immunization level should have an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
We used an agent-based simulation model to reproduce the COVID-19 pandemic in
Austria to estimate the immunization level of the population as of February 2021. We
ran several simulations of an uncontrolled epidemic wave with varying initial immunization scenarios to assess the effect on the effective reproduction number. We also
used a classic differential equation SIR-model to cross-validate the simulation model.
As of February 2021, 14.7% of the Austrian population has been affected by a SARSCoV-2 infection which causes a 9% reduction of the effective reproduction number and

This estimation is now recomputed on a regular basis to publish model based analysis
of immunization level in Austria also including the fast growing effects of vaccination

Introduction

According to the WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan (interview on 2021.01.11,
Deutsche Welle TV), herd immunity with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will
likely not be reached in 2021. Despite increasing availability and roll out of vaccines and
(partial) immunization of individuals/persons with a recent infection, the spread of the
pandemic cannot be mitigated without further non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
such as social distancing and increased hygienic awareness. Nevertheless, one can expect
that an increasing number of people immunized by having been exposed to the virus will
at least slightly slow down the current spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We furthermore want
to denote this by the term herd effect.
To assess this effect, first, the total number of persons already exposed to the virus
needs to be estimated. This number generally consists of the cumulative number of detected SARS-CoV-2 infections and the corresponding amount of cumulative undetected
infections that occurred in the background. Since the ratio between these cohorts depends
on the reporting system, it is very difficult to transfer findings between different countries.
The ratio is most often estimated using randomized studies screening for antibodies. But
these studies are very time and cost intensive and therefore rarely performed on a regular basis. Other approaches rely on indirect methods such as estimates for the infection
fatality ratio and the case fatality ratio [1].
Given the number of persons already exposed to the virus, we evaluate the herd effect
using modeling and simulation scenarios. Hereby we will compare the disease spread on
the example of fictional epidemic waves with and without immunity. We assume that
exposed persons developed sufficient antibodies to protect from secondary infections, but
also elaborate the limitations and consequences of this assumption. As outcome measures, we investigate the reduction of the effective reproduction number and of the peak
prevalence number.
For both tasks, we apply an agent-based model (ABM) in combination with data
from performed cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and serological tests in Austria.
This ABM has already been used for several scientific studies such as the investigation of
tracing measures [2] or the general dynamics of undetected cases [3], and is one of three
models that participate in the official Austrian COVID forecasting panel by the ministry
of health (COVID Prognose Konsortium, [4]), which publishes short time forecasts on a
weekly basis. For the herd effect, we will also perform cross model validation of the ABM
with analytical results from a classic differential equation based SIR-model.

Using this experimental setup, we aim to gain a well founded picture of the total
number of known and unknown SARS-CoV-2 cases in Austria until February 2021. We
provide estimates on how the corresponding immunization level of the population reduces
the maximum epidemiological growth. Based thereon, we formulate the necessary efforts
for disease containment.

Methods

In this section, we present a short introduction to the agent-based model, a specification
of the used data and a detailed description of the study setup.

2.1

Agent-based simulation model

We use an agent-based model to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. In this
model, each agent acts as a statistical representative of a member of the Austrian population, characterized by their age, sex, and place of residence. Using a contact network
based on households, workplaces, school and leisure time, the disease can be spread from
agent to agent. Once infected, an agent passes through different stages of a SARS-CoV2 infection, including latency period and incubation period. The model also includes a
detection probability which defines whether an agent’s infection will later be confirmed
by a positive test result and be recorded in the official vigilance system or whether they
remain an undetected case. This parameter is a joint summary of different probabilities
such as the chance for an asymptomatic disease progression, the chance to be found in a
screening program, and the overall test sensitivity used for detection. By simulating each
infection and not only the cases represented in the official vigilance systems, the model
can provide a complete picture of the epidemic behavior and the total number of people
affected by the virus. A more in-depth description of the simulation model as well as used
model parameters are provided in parameter tables in [2].
As one of the key features of the agent-based model, the model structure allows a very
detailed observation of all processes taking place in the simulation. Consequently, the user
has almost no limitations regarding definition of the outcome measures. For the present
study, our main interest lies in the dynamics, that is time series, of SARS-CoV-2 infected
agents – active, cumulative as well as daily new infected. Since we also investigate the
detection process of agents, we also observe the detected agents – active, cumulative as well
as daily new detected agents – which correspond to the reported case numbers in Austria.
Note, that new detected agents correspond to all agents that were detected (received a
positive test) on that specific date. Thus, new detected differs from new infected not only
by a factor (detection probability) but also by a time delay.

2.2

Differential Equation SIR model

For cross model validation we compare the results from the agent-based model with results
from the classic SIR model by Kermack and McKendrick [5]. It is defined by the three
coupled differential equations

with N = S + I + R, and suitable initial conditions. Hereby, the functions S, I and R
stand for the time evolution of the total number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered
persons in the system.

2.3

Data

In order to parametrize and calibrate the simulation model, a wide range of different data
sources has been used. Since these data sources are not specific for the present study, but
match the used parameters in previous works, we refer to the parameter tables found in
the supplemental material of [2]. With respect to the present study, we want to focus on
data sources that reveal information about the detection rate of cases. In Austria, several
randomized studies have been performed to estimate the total number of current or past
SARS-CoV-2 infections.
In April, SORA Institute for Social Research and Consulting determined that 0.33%
(95%CI: 0.12%−0.75%) of the population or approximately 28500 (95%CI: 10200 – 67400)
people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 between April 4th 2020 and April 6th 2020 (sample
size = 1544) [6]. Statistics Austria performed two screening programs between April 22nd
2020 and April 25th 2020 and between May 26th 2020 and May 30th 2020 [7]. In the first
screening program, 1 of 1432 samples was tested positive resulting in a maximum of 0.15%
of the population being currently infected (upper bound of the 95%-confidence interval)
and in the second screening program, none of the 1279 samples were tested positive.
During the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria, Statistics Austria
performed once more a randomized screening study [7] and estimated that 3.1% (95%CI:
2.6% − 3.5%) of the people aged 16 or older were currently infected with SARS-CoV-2
between November 12th 2020 and November 14th 2020 and that 4.7% (95%CI: 3.8%−5.6%)
showed antibodies, meaning they had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before mid
/ end of October 2020 (sample size = 2263).

2.4

Estimating the immunization level in February 2021

For the estimation of the immunization level, we ran our simulation model for the time
span between February 2020 and February 2021. We identified the parameter for the

detection rate based on study data and the method published in [3].
In specific, applying the method introduced in [3], the results of a prevalence study
(SORA [6]) conducted in April 2020 result in a detection probability of 13% (CI 95%:
[2%,86%]) [3]. The second study (Statistics Austria [7]), performed during the second
wave of COVID-19, indicates an increase of the detection probability to 35% (CI 95%:
[24%, 58%]). In our simulation model, we assumed these values to be characteristic for the
corresponding epidemic wave. We set the detection probability parameter to a probability
of 13% from February 2020 until August 15th 2020 and gradually increased it to 35% until
September 1st 2020. This date was chosen because by mid August, Austria implemented a
broader testing regime, starting with the free of charge testing of returnees from vacation
destinations classified as risk regions and later introduction of excessive nationwide antigen
testing for surveillance [8].
To guarantee that the detected cases in the model match the officially reported case
numbers, we proceeded analogous to [2] and [3] and calibrated the infection probability
parameter as well as all parameters corresponding to governmental policies for this time
period using an iterative bisection method. Hereby, the match of the cumulative detected
cases and the officially reported numbers for the positive tests is the calibration target.
Ultimately, in order to obtain an estimate of the immunization level in February 2021,
we investigate the final state of our simulation runs. The ratio between the total active
and past infected agents and the total number of agents in the model (equivalent to the
size of the Austrian population) poses the immunization level and hereby the first major
outcome of the model. Note that agents who died (1) from COVID-19, (2) from other
causes while being infected, and (3) from other causes after being infected are properly
removed by the simulation dynamics and do not contribute to the immunization level.

2.5

Estimating the herd effect

It is our aim to assess how the presumably achieved seroprevalence could affect the future
progression of the epidemic. To that end, we investigate a fictional, unconfined outbreak
of the disease and compare simulation results with different initial immunization levels.
That means, we assume no implementation of new NPIs, no change in the contact behavior
or any other effects on epidemic progression besides decrease of the susceptible population.
We will test for sensitivity on the initial immunization (x% of the total population) in both
models and provide a discussion of the obtained differences and similarities in the used
indicators. Moreover, we observe target indicators such as the time-dependent effective
reproduction number and the prevalence of infected and detected cases and study them
in comparison with a scenario without initially immunized persons.
The effective reproduction number Reff (t) is understood as the average number of infections that are generated by an individual that gets infected at time t. Since this number
cannot be measured directly in reality, statistical models for inferring the reproduction
factor from available data (e.g. reported incidence) must be used. These methods must
take into account disease specific parameters, such as the incubation or the infectious pe5

riod, implying a certain simplified model of disease progression. The effective reproductive
number is suitable to differentiate between epidemic progression (Reff (t) > 1) and a stable
or declining regime (Reff (t) ≤ 1). In this study, we rely on a statistical approach that is
available in the software packages EpiEstim [9]. For the configuration of the underlying
statistical model (serial interval mean and deviation), we use parameters provided by the
Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety [10]. The same approach is used by authorities and agencies in Austria to provide official estimates of the current reproduction
number.
Based thereon, we define the characteristic reproduction factor R̂eff as the reproductive
factor Reff (t̂) at time t̂ chosen such that (1) the spread of the disease is not yet slowed
down by a significant reduction of initially susceptible population and (2) the incidence is
high enough to allow for a stable evaluation of the effective reproduction number. Thus,
the characteristic reproduction factor is attained in the ‘stable’ phase of an epidemic
wave lasting either to the onset of herd immunity effects or until the implementation of
countermeasures (i.e. a change in the mixing behavior of the population). Analogously,
we assume that a distinct peak/maximum in the observed prevalence is attained at some
point in time. We rely on this maximum prevalence number Imax as a second indicator
for quantifying the reduction of epidemic spread.
For cross validation, we extract above indicators from two different simulation models
that reproduce the fictional wave scenario. The first model is the macroscopic SIR model
presented in Section 2.2 and the second model is the ABM introduced in Section 2.1. The
former is well suited to generate initial estimates of the investigated target values, since
many quantities of the model can be calculated without any numerical simulation. The
latter is used to get a more detailed picture of the target measures under consideration of
heterogeneous mixing (contact networks).

Herd effect estimation using a classic SIR model

Even though there is no analytic solution to these differential equations, the equations still
allow to investigate several important epidemiological measures analytically, as long as no
containment related policy is applied that changes the values of α and β dynamically. For
example, R0 , the basic reproduction rate, is found as the quotient R0 = α/β. With S(t)
being the population of the susceptible, the effective reproduction rate calculates to

2.5.2

Herd effect estimation using an agent-based approach

We apply the agent-based model to run two sets of scenarios corresponding to the initial
household setting of the immune agents. In the first set, we distribute the immune individuals fully randomly in the population. In the second set, we reuse the final state of the
simulation used for estimation of the seroprevalence level (see Section 2.4) as the initial
state of the new simulation. Hereby, we directly transfer all households with immune
agents from the previous simulation and import them into the initial agent population of
this simulation. In this way, regional and household clusters from the original simulation
are preserved and the spread is more realistic. This approach allows to asses the impact
of heterogeneous immunization on our results (compare [11]).
For each scenario, we simulate a hypothetical epidemic wave over the course of six
months by randomly introducing 40 infected individuals at the start. This initial number
was experimentally determined to produce the most stable results for the stochastic agentbased model.
To calculate the defined outcome measures, we export aggregated daily incidence and
prevalence data for the infected and the detected population from our agent-based simulations. The time series of the prevalence allows for direct measurement of the peak
height (compare with equation (5)). We further apply the statistical estimator for the
effective reproduction number that is provided by the epiEstim package on our simulated
case data. Hereby, we distinguish between the reproduction calculated from the simulated
det
case incidence (Rtot
eff ) and the one calculated from the detected cases only (Reff ). The
latter models to the process performed in the real system, the prior is more accurate, but
lacks a real world comparator.

Immunization level

The calibration process of the ABM achieved to match the cumulative detected cases in
the simulation with the officially reported case numbers with a root mean square error
of RM SE = 3721 cases. The quality of the fit can be seen in the lower right part of
Figure 1. The other parts of the figure give insights into the dynamics of detected and
undetected cases as resulting from the model. Figure 2 shows the share of the population
with an active or past infection for selected dates. The selected dates represent the dates
relevant for the screening studies (April 5th 2020, mid / end October 2020, November
13th 2020), a date at the end of the first epidemic wave (June 1st 2020) and a current
date (February 1st 2021). As of February 1st 2021, 14.1% (97.5%CI: 6.6% − 38.1%) of
the Austrian population is already immune to SARS-CoV-2 and 14.7% (97.5%CI: 7.1% −
38.8%) or approximately 1.3 million people (97.5%CI: 640 000 - 3.5 million) has been in
contact with SARS-CoV-2 due to an active or past infection. From February 2021 also
vaccinated persons will be included in this estimation according to the actual assumptions

Quantifying the Herd Effect
Classic SIR Model

Assuming that a certain percentage x of the population is initially immune (i.e. R(0) =
x
100 N ), the complementary compartment S(0) + I(0) = N − R(0) is reduced by the same
x
amount. Considering that the initial prevalence I(0) is negligible small, S(0) ≈ (1 − 100
)N
can be derived.
x
In the classic SIR model, Reff (0) = αS(0)/βN = α(1 − 100
)/β. We see that the
initial value of Reff depends linearly on the immunity level of the population and 14.1%
initial immune persons result in Reff (0) being 85.9% of its original value. Note that this
statement does not hold for Reff (t) in general, since the time dynamics of the SIR model
are nonlinear.
Moreover, we apply equation (5) to estimate the impact on the peak of the disease

the total population N cancels out of the equation. Applying the formula with typical
estimate R0 = 3, an immunization level x of 7.05% results in a reduced peak by 15.4%.
Moreover, 14.1% provide a 30.1% reduced peak, 21.15% lead to a 44.0% reduced peak
and 28.2% initial immune reduce the maximal peak height by 57.1%. R0 = 4 leads to a
relative reduction of 13.8% for an immunization level of 7.05%, 25.5% for an immunization
level of 14.1%, 37.7% for an immunization level of 21.15% and 49.4% for an immunization
level of 28.2%. (see Figure 6). Easily seen, the relation is almost linear for values x close
to zero.

Agent-based model

Using the agent-based model, we simulated 10 different scenarios of an epidemic wave
of SARS-CoV-2 infections with different initial network structures and 5 levels of seroprevalence. Figure 3 depicts various outcome measures of the different scenarios, such as
timelines of prevalence and incidence for all cases as well as the detected cases. It can be
seen, that a higher immunization level does not only reduce the peak of maximal prevalence but also delays it by 4 days (for 7% immune) to 20-23 days (for 28.2% immune).
Furthermore, for all scenarios, the timeline of the new detected cases is delayed by about
9 days compared to the timeline of new infections. This delay occurs because cases are
detected about 9 days after their infection as the mean incubation time is 5.1 days and
the mean reaction time between symptom onset and positive test results is 3.8 days [3].
The detected cases are also reduced to 35% of all cases which corresponds to the detection
probability applied for these scenarios. The network structure of the initially immune
individuals has only a small effect on the epidemic curve. Incidences are delayed by 1-2
days with the delay growing with the immunization level but the overall dynamic and
the height of the incidence peak is not affected otherwise. Therefore, in the following, we
will only present the results for the scenarios with randomly distributed initially immune
individuals. The results for the other scenarios can be found in the appendix.

Discussion

An agent-based model was used to give a detailed estimate on the level of immunization
among the Austrian population in February 2021 and how this influences the future spread
of the pandemic. The modeling and simulation study reveals that with February 1st 2021, a
total number of 1.328 million Austrian inhabitants have already been exposed to the virus
of which 1.319 million are still alive to this date, 7778 died due to COVID-19, and 1030 died
after having recovered from the disease. Assuming that the persons being exposed to the
virus developed sufficient antibodies for immunization, 14.1% of the Austrian population
can be considered immune by February 2021. The results of the modeling study indicate
that this level of immunization leads to a maximum reduction of Reff by 9% compared to
a fully susceptible population and a reduction of the maximum prevalence by 24.7% (see
Figure 6). Assuming that the virus remains as infectious as it has been in spring 2020,
this percentage directly maps to the policies required for containment of the disease.
With respect to quantifying the herd effect, we defined different outcome measures
giving similar, yet slightly different pictures. This underlines, that defining consistent
outcome measures for assessment of epidemic spread related measures or effects is still a
challenging task. In specific, our study shows that even though estimations of the relative
reduction of the effective reproduction number due to an initial immunization level can
be drawn from the classical SIR-model, these estimations do not directly relate to the

results of more complex simulation models. First, the classical SIR-model neglects or
oversimplifies some important factors of the modeling of SARS-CoV-2, the most important
being the incubation and latency period, the isolation of symptomatic cases and the general
stochasticity of the system. Second, measuring Reff in a post-processing step from case
numbers gives different results than directly measuring Reff from the model parameters
since additional parameter assumptions need to be made.
Apart from these differences, comparisons between the results of the agent-based model
and the analytic calculations from the classical SIR model show interesting similarities and
insights. First of all, the agent-based model results follow the linearity predicted by the
analytic calculations: the maximum value of Reff (t), approximated by the characteristic
reproduction rate, and the maximum peak height of the active cases Imax relate indirect
proportionally to the base immunity level of the population. This feature contributes to
the cross-model validation of the agent-based model. Secondly, the agent-based model also
provides a much deeper insight into the disease spread related processes than the classic
SIR model. For example, we find different sources for time-delays in different outcomes
tot
such as the delay of about 9 days between Rdet
eff (t) and Reff (t) (see Figure 4) and the delay
of about 1-2 days caused by a different initial network structure (see Figure 3). The prior
nicely depicts why any kind of COVID-19 countermeasure can only show effects in the
reported case numbers at the earliest one week after introduction of the policy and is well
known among policy makers. The latter is a less obvious observation and requires deeper
analysis. It shows that the disease requires about 1 to 2 days to “break out” of naturally
grown immunized networks while it can already spread with higher velocity if the initial
network of immunized agents is randomly created. This can be emphasised as a surprising
finding of this study, since we would have expected a higher impact of the initial network
structure.
Our method to evaluate the total number of people who have been in contact with
SARS-CoV-2 differs from other approaches using estimates of the infection fatality rate [1]
and resulting in an estimated immunization level of 7% for Austria in February 2021.
Moreover, our method to quantify the effect of this immunization level is vastly different to
methods applied for other infectious diseases that rely on observational studies performed
before and after vaccination of a large portion of the population [12] [13].
The results of this study are limited by general limitations of modeling and simulation
based research including modeling simplifications and data quality. Like all models on the
total amount of infected persons also this work relies on international and national studies
and analysis of not detected cases based on measured data. In addition we assumed that
a past infection of SARS-COV-2 will always result in immunity long enough for the scope
of this study. Studies have shown that antibodies against SARS-COV-2 can be found 6
months after an infection in 84% of the cases [14] and that a previous infection lowers
the risk of a new infection by 83% [15]. However, more and more reports of reinfections
with SARS-COV-2 emerge with the second wave of COVID-19 since fall 2020, indicating
that this model assumption might be too general. Yet, since there is still too little data
available, we found the evidence not convincing enough to change fundamental parts of
16

the model at the moment. Furthermore, we did not account for the rising number of
mutations of SARS-COV-2. As with general reinfections, we did not consider subsequent
infections with different mutations. Similarly, we did not vary the overall infectivity of
SARS-COV-2. This means, we did not account for potentially higher infectivity of new
mutants that slowly replace current strains.
The data sources used for this study also have several limitations. Some of the randomized prevalence studies have been performed at a time with low case numbers (end
of April 2020 and May 2020). Here, the sample size of 1432 and 1279, respectively, were
not big enough to produce a significant outcome useful for further analyses. Moreover,
all prevalence studies only included people age 16 or older and did therefore provide no
further insight in the number of undetected cases among children. Finally, the official data
used for calibrating the model comes with a great number of reporting bias. Reported
cases vary highly with weekends and national holidays or the testing regime applied in the
different Austrian federal states.
Next steps include constant reevaluation of the immunization level and its impact on
the spread of COVID-19 in Austria, especially focused on the effect of the vaccination
program in Austria. This provides substantial information for decision makers to evaluate
the necessity of NPI-measures based on the estimated impact of natural and vaccinated
immunization at a given moment. Further research will include additional analysis and
adaption of modelling parameters once new evidence from randomized screening studies
and more reliable data on the risk of reinfection with new virus strains or the role of
waning antibodies is available.

Derivation of Formula (5).

We consider the classic SIR model (1)-(3) with R0 = α/β > 1, initial conditions
I(0), S(0), R(0) > 0, and I(0) + S(0) + R(0) = N .
For the first case, we will investigate S(0) > N β/α. This ensures, that I 0 (0) > 0 and
the results of the model will show a classic epidemic outbreak.
Since equation (1) has a strictly negative right hand side, the resulting function S must
be monotonically decreasing. Consequently, S −1 is a well defined function on the value
set of S and we may investigate F defined by
F : image(S(t)) → R : F (u) 7→ I(S −1 (u)).
−

With u = S(t) the function results in F (S 1 (S(t))) = I(t) and therefore describes the
number of the infectious I as a function of the susceptible S.
Using the chain rule, and the rule for the differentiation of inverse functions, we derive

the value umax = Nαβ maximizes F , as long as it lies in the image of S(t). This is necessarily
true, since S(0) > umax and I 0 (t) > 0 for all S(t) > umax . Therefore, S needs to drop
below umax in the course of the epidemic wave and there exists a tmax > 0 s.t.
Smax := S(tmax ) = umax .
Finally, we may find the corresponding maximum peak value Imax = I(tmax ) = F (S(tmax ))

Figure 7: Estimates of the effective reproduction number for different initial immunization
level. The effective reproduction number has been evaluated both on the total new cases
as well as on the detected new cases. In the lower plot, the evaluation based on all new
cases has been shifted to account for the time delay between infection and detection date.
