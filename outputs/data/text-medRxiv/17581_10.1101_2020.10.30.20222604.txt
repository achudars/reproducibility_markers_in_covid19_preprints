eddies, vapour field, and temperature field with the respiratory
droplets. Therefore, accurate quantification of these effects is
necessary.
On the fate of respiratory droplets in fluid flow, classical
work was done by William F. Wells in 1930s (22, 23). The
picture that Wells developed, at that time in connection with
the transmission of tuberculosis, considers only the settling
and evaporation of the droplets. After droplets are expelled
from the mouth, they settle to the ground by gravity, and,
in this simple model, they evaporate with their surface area
decreasing linearly with time, the so-called d2 -law (24). Then
for a given ambient temperature and relative humidity, one
can estimate the lifetime of the respiratory droplet based on
the d2 -law.
However, in an actual respiratory event, the assumptions
of settling and evaporation are insufficient to describe the
full physical process. In reality, more complicated flows are
possible: Abkarian et al. (25) demonstrated that speech can
produce jet-like flow transport, and Bhagat et al. (11) illustrated that body or breathing plumes from a person can also
spread droplet nuclei in enclosed spaces. Recently, a new
paradigm has been suggested by Bourouiba et al. (1, 3, 26),
which states that instead of the isolated droplet being considered, one should also take into account the importance of
turbulent vapour puff. Inspired by this paradigm, using direct

The ambient conditions surrounding liquid droplets determine their
growth or shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet
expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and
the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of
airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of
such dependencies are critical. Here we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapour puff and account for
the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and
aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking
their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and
humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated,
expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only
later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage
of droplets as expected from the classical view by William F. Wells
(1934). Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of
air to hold water vapour, thus causing the respiratory vapour puff
to super-saturate. Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field
drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within
the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet
growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet. Our model correctly predicts supersaturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with
our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be
employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.

Significance Statement

The flow physics of respiratory droplet is crucial to understand the airborne transmission of respiratory diseases (1, 2),
and recently due to the pandemic of COVID-19, the interest on
this subject has been renewed (3–12). Tiny saliva and mucus
droplets, mostly of the size of tens to hundreds of micrometers
(13, 14), are expelled from the mouth at speaking, screaming,
shouting, singing, coughing, sneezing, or even breathing. The
expelled micro-sized droplets have long been recognized to
be the carriers for viruses which are responsible for the viral
transmission from one host to others (15).
Airborne disease transmission is a difficult subject because
many intricate factors simultaneously affect the transmission
and a complete understanding requires multi-disciplinary collaboration (16, 17). In addition to the understanding from
epidemiology (18–20) and virology (21), fluid mechanics also
offers essential insight into the mechanisms of airborne disease transmission (2). However, surprisingly little is known
on the transport and fate of the respiratory droplets, once
they have been expelled from the mouth. For example, how
the air temperature and the relative humidity influences the
actual fate of the droplets remains an open question. It is a
complicated process involving interactions between turbulent

Influence of environmental conditions on airborne diseases
transmission is an important issue, especially during the pandemic of COVID-19. Human-to-human transmission is mediated by the transport of virus-laden respiratory droplets. Here
we investigate the problem from a fluid mechanics perspective by conducting numerical simulations to quantify the fate
of respiratory droplets in a warm humid coughing puff under
different ambient conditions. We reveal a non-intuitive regime
with considerable growth of respiratory droplets, dominated
by a super-saturated vapour field, preferentially occurring in
cold and humid environments. We further propose a theoretical model that accurately predicts the condition for droplet
growth. Our work should inform socializing policies and ventilation strategies for controlling indoor ambient conditions to
mitigate dispersion of droplets from asymptomatic individuals.

both at RHamb = 90%. Corresponding movies can be seen in Movies S1 and S2. The snapshots show (i) vertical 2D planes of the local RH fields, (ii) the instantaneous
droplets spatial distribution, (iii) the heavy large droplets which already fell on the ground, and (iv) the instantaneous droplet size histograms versus distance. The local
RH planes are taken from the vertical mid-plane of the puff and are plotted on the background for clarity. Droplets are colour coded by their instantaneous sizes. Initial
droplet sizes are prescribed with a distribution similar to J. P. Duguid (13) (plotted in Fig. S2) and are injected evenly in time with the same local inflow velocity. The initial
temperature of the droplets and puff is 34◦C. Both snapshots are taken at 0.6s corresponding to the cut-off time of the puff. In the colder conditions of (B), the expelled humid
puff over-saturates (seen as the lighter colored RH field and visible in Movie S2), which in turn dictates growth of smaller droplets caught within the puff. Correspondingly, the
droplet counts are confined within a narrower range of sizes in (B) as compared to (A), see Fig. 2A.

numerical simulations, Chong et al. (27) showed that droplets
have O(100) longer lifetimes in a turbulent vapour puff at
high ambient relative humidity than that predicted by the
d2 -law. Past numerical studies that consider different ambient
conditions typically adopt mean flow modelling approaches
(28–30). The role of ambient conditions requires large-scale
parameterizations, (31–33) but run the risk of obscuring the
underlying physics.
In this study, we aim at quantifying the effect of ambient
temperature (θamb ) and relative humidity (RHamb ) on the
respiratory droplets using direct numerical simulations of a
turbulent puff. Normal coughing with an actual injection
profile has been simulated with 5000 droplets being tracked by
the Euler-Lagrangian approach. We reveal a regime in which
the respiratory droplets considerably grow before their shrinkage due to evaporation. The droplets growth happens under
specific combinations of ambient conditions, preferentially in
cold and humid environment. To predict the criteria of having
droplet growth, we further propose a theoretical model to estimate the local relative humidity experienced by the droplets,
which agrees excellently to our simulation results. Whilst our
model can help to formulate public health guidelines or indoor
ventilation strategies in order to mitigate the spreading of respiratory droplets, the infectivity of virus-containing droplets
and droplet nuclei, which remain after evaporation still requires further investigation, in particular on the virus dose
required for infections and whether dried-out droplet nuclei
may also be infectious. This issue remains controversial (15)
and cannot be answered within a fluid dynamical study.

10, 20, 30◦C. As a point of reference, the solid lines denote the initial droplet
size distributions. The bin size of the histogram is 2µm. At t = 0.6s (panel A), the
peak of the histogram for θamb = 30◦C marginally shifts down, whereas the overall
histogram for θamb = 10◦C remains roughly similar to the initial distribution. The
gap is more pronounced at t = 1.2s (panel B): For θamb = 30◦C, the peak of the
histogram is halved from the initial peak, whereas in contrast, for θamb = 10◦C, the
histogram still remains roughly unchanged. The relative invariance of the histogram
for θamb = 10◦C is due to the droplet growth dictated by the super-saturated vapour
puff, which is in turn determined by cold and humid ambient conditions, as described
in the main text.

shown in figure 1 together with the instantaneous droplet
distributions and instantaneous count histogram. At θamb =
30◦C, the local RH field is almost indistinguishable from
RHamb , as shown in Fig. 1A. In contrast, at θamb = 10◦C
(Fig. 1B), the local RH field reaches super-saturation values
larger than 100% (whitish colour shading). In the count
histograms in Fig. 1B, most of the droplet diameters remain at
least around 20 µm throughout the spread distance, whereas
in Fig. 1A, droplet diameters can go below 20 µm. This means
that droplets expelled into colder ambient surroundings shrink
slower because of the super-saturated local RH field. On the
other hand, droplets expelled into hotter ambient surroundings
shrink much more rapidly because the local RH rapidly undersaturates.
To illustrate the temperature sensitivity of the droplet size
distributions, in Fig. 2, the distributions across three θamb ,
10◦C, 20◦C, and 30◦C are shown at t = 0.6s (Fig. 2A) and
1.2s (Fig. 2B). In the figure, the initial droplet size distribution
(solid line) is also included for comparison. In Fig. 2A, which
corresponds to the cut-off time of the simulated puff, many
smaller droplets . 15um already exist at θamb = 20◦C and
30◦C as compared to θamb = 10◦C. Interestingly, the histogram
distribution of droplet diameters for θamb = 10◦C is slightly
higher and shifted to the right from the initial droplet size
histogram, reflecting that a portion of the smaller droplets
in fact grew. The reason for this increase is that due to the
cold surrounding air, which can take up less vapour than the
warm one, the puff gets super-saturated. This effect will be
quantified in detail in Section B. At the later time of t = 1.2s
(Fig. 2B), most of the droplet sizes for θamb = 20◦C and 30◦C
are shifted to the left towards much smaller sizes. Remarkably,
the size distribution for θamb = 10◦C remains roughly similar
to the initially prescribed size distribution, with some lower
counts at sizes . 15µm.
After having shown the distinct droplet shrinkage behaviour
under different ambient conditions, in the following section,
we will further and in more detail quantify how the local fluid
properties affect the shrinkage rate of the droplets.

B. Lagrangian Statistics of the Droplets. For the following La-

grangian statistics, we focus on the droplets with initial diameter around 15µm, given that for those we observe the most
pronounced temperature effect, see the count histogram in
Fig. 2B. First, we track the droplet surface area ∝ d2 versus
time as shown in Fig. 3A,B. Note that droplets are expelled
from the mouth at different time instants until the respiratory
event stops (0.6s for the coughing event considered here). In
order to compare the droplet statistics, we have shifted the
time frame by their respective ejecting times.
For θamb = 30◦C (Fig. 3A), the normalized surface area of
the droplets d2 /d2init decreases monotonically with time (the
ensemble average of the value is depicted by the solid curve),
which indicates pure evaporation of the expelled droplets. The
surface area decreases linearly with time with the averaged
droplets surface area being halved after 1s. Although a linear
decline of the surface area is consistent with the classical d2 law (24), one should note that the magnitude of the droplet
shrinkage rate is still much smaller than that predicted by
William F. Wells (22). Such a discrepancy is caused by the
fact that the turbulent vapour puff engulfs small droplets and
the puff contains higher RH than the ambient fluid (3, 27).
Surprisingly, for the low θamb of 10◦C (Fig. 3B), the resNg et al.

θamb = 30◦C and 10◦C. (A,B) Change of droplet surface area d2 /d2init versus time,
(C,D) Temperature difference between droplets and surrounding fluid, θdrop − θfluid ,
versus time, and (E,F) Local RH versus time experienced by droplets. The time is
shifted to the initial expelled time of each droplet. The ensemble average value is
shown by the solid curve. The droplet counts are indicated by the colors, see inset
colorbars. For θamb = 30◦C (in A), droplets undergo pure evaporation after being
expelled. Conversely, for θamb = 10◦C (in B), most droplets undergo growth in the
initial stages and then evaporate. This growth in (B) is dictated by the super-saturated
local RH values (see F and visible in Movie S2), which exceed 100%.

piratory droplets evolve in a very different and distinct way:
Instead of the pure evaporation during the time evolution of
the droplets, there exists an initial stage (from the expelled
time to about 0.4s) during which the droplets can grow with
the averaged d2 increasing by 10%. This non-monotonic trend
of the shrinkage markedly differs from the classical d2 -law. It
also contradicts the well-accepted view that the respiratory
droplets should simply evaporate after expulsion. Such a phenomenon of droplets condensation during the respiratory event
is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, to be quantified thanks to the Lagrangian statistics obtained from DNS,
which has been neglected in the hitherto studies of droplet
transmission in exhalation.
Another indicator that for 10◦C the droplet size first increases is that the droplet temperature θdrop increases relative
to the fluid temperature at the location of the droplet θfluid
(Fig. 3D). As latent heat is released during droplet condensation for 10◦C (Fig. 3D), the difference θdrop − θfluid increases
during the early time. In contrast, θdrop − θfluid remains less
than zero for θamb = 30◦C (Fig. 3C), due to the latent heat

all extend beyond x/dmouth ≈ 25 since the model assumes a fully developed jet,
which is not the case for the present simulated case of a puff. However, the near-field
axial model accurately captures the puff, implying quasi-stationary self-similar jet
characteristics.

computed for RHamb = 90% with the color coded by the local RH . The boundary
for RH oversaturation (local RH > 100%) is shown by the dashed line. With
decreasing θamb , the range with local RH > 100% (width of the reddish area under
the dashed curve) increases, which promotes growth of the smaller droplets because
of the longer exposure to super-saturated regions. The most serious super-saturation
conditions in this plot are for θamb = 5◦C and x/dmouth ≈ 10 − 15, namely beyond
a local RH of 130%. For a given θamb , the location of the maximum is marked by a
dashed red line.

axial scalar quantities (vapour mass fraction and temperature) are the dominant fluid properties that determine droplet
growth/evaporation, and secondly, the exhaled puff at the
time of t = 0.2s exhibits jet-like properties such that the quasistationary mean properties of the puff admits self-similarity.
Here, we employ the Antoine equation in order to compute the
saturated vapour mass fraction for a given temperature field
(34). In short, given the local values of vapour mass fraction
and temperature along the jet centreline, the axial RH can
be directly computed.
Following the theory for axisymmetric turbulent jets (35–
37), the axial scalar concentration distribution (say Φaxial ) can
be approximated by the relation,

needed for evaporation. Eventually, the droplet temperature
saturates at a value lower than the fluid temperature. This is
reasonable because the Jakob number, which is the ratio of
the sensible heat to the latent heat due to the phase change,
is much smaller than one (0.04 and 0.007 for θamb = 10◦C and
30◦C, respectively). Therefore, the evaporation cooling effect
plays a significant role here.
To understand why the droplets can grow during the early
time, a key quantity to examine is the local RH experienced
by the droplet. In Fig. 3E,F, we compare the time evolution
of the local RH at the droplet location for the two different
θamb , showing quite different behaviours: For 30◦C, the local RH decreases monotonically to RHamb which is 90% in
this case. However, for 10◦C, the droplets first experience
super-saturation within 0.4s after expelling and the maximum
RH reaches almost 115%. This duration of having supersaturation is consistent with the duration of droplet growth,
which reflects that it is the local super-saturation of the surrounding air which makes the droplets grow.
In fact, our daily life experience gives us intuition about
this intriguing droplet condensation phenomenon. In cold and
humid weather, one may observe the “white mist” coming out
from the mouth while breathing or speaking. The physical
explanation is that: Warm air can contain more moisture than
cold air. Therefore, the exhaled warm vapour puff becomes
super-saturated when it enters the cold ambient fluid, and the
droplet nuclei and dust in air favours vapour condensation.
Such super-saturated conditions become more prominent if
the temperature difference between the exhaled vapour and
ambient fluid is larger. Here, we have clearly demonstrated the
significance of super-saturation in the respiratory event that
leads to the possibility of vastly different droplet dynamics.

where Φinlet is the inlet scalar concentration value, and x/dinlet
is the axial distance normalised by the inlet diameter. Since
this model diverges as x/dinlet → 0, we further impose the
requirement that max[Φaxial /Φinlet ]= 1. Both the exhaled
vapour mass fraction and temperature are modelled using
Eq. (1) along the axis normal to the inlet.
To assess the validity of our assumptions, we plot the
resulting model of the axial RH profiles for different θamb in
Fig. 4. The agreement with our DNS (lighter curves) is quite
promising, which is consistent with our assumption that the
puff retains self-similar jet-like characteristics at cut-off time.
This agreement lends some confidence to our ability to model
the axial RH of our flow at a specific time instant, while the
cough will approximate to a turbulent puff or an interrupted
jet at large t after the injection velocity becomes negligible
(38).
Based on the robustness of this model, we further propose
the use of the maximum local RH as a metric to indicate
the likelihood of the growth for small droplets. To illustrate
this point, in Fig. 5, we plot the axial RH map for various
θamb versus distance at the fixed RHamb of 90%. The dashed
line shows the crossover between super-saturated and undersaturated axial RH values. One interesting observation from

Conclusions
Through the Lagrangian statistics of the respiratory droplets,
we have identified that when droplets are expelled from the
mouth to the cold environment with high enough relative humidity, the droplet will first grow instead of immediately shrink,
because the turbulent vapour puff becomes super-saturated.
More importantly, we have provided a theoretical framework
to accurately predict (i) how the relative humidity varies with
distance in a respiratory puff, and (ii) the threshold of ambient
temperature (θamb ) and relative humidity (RHamb ) for which
the super-saturated vapour field can result. Our theoretical
model can also be applied to other respiratory events whenever there is jet-like transport, such as speaking (25), which
is extremely relevant for asymptomatic and presymptomatic
spreading of the coronavirus. In the situation of continuous
speaking, when the hot vapour is continuously injected into the
cold environment, we expect that the super-saturation zone
may remain in front of the mouth for a long period of time.
Our finding implies that tiny droplets of the size of tens of
micrometers can propagate further away when the weather is
cold and humid due to the protection from the super-saturated
vapour field. The result of the very distinct fate of respiratory
droplets under different RHamb and θamb may be instructive
for developing timely strategies in mitigating the COVID-19
pandemic in different seasons. For example, during the Winter
time, where the maritime climate for many coastline European countries have much higher RHamb , the transmission in
outdoor environments can presumably not be overlooked. However, we note that obviously also non-fluid-dynamical aspects
affect the transmission and infectivity of viruses, such as from
virology, epidemiology, and sociology, to name a few. These
are not covered within our study and presumably interfere
with our fluid dynamical results.

Fig. 6. Map of maximum local RH super-saturation values (see Fig. 5) for different
θamb and RHamb based on the RH model. For the case of RHamb = 90% these are
the values of the maximal local RH in Fig. 5 (red dashed curve). The values can be
used as a gauge to indicate the tendency of droplets to experience super-saturation,
given that the droplets are caught within the turbulent puff. The color is coded by
the upper bounds for super-saturation. The plot indicates that in cool and humid
environments, small droplets within a coughing puff will tend to grow once expelled.
To assess the performance of our model, we also plot our DNS results for droplets
with an initial size of ≈ 15µm and indicate growth or shrinkage using circle and
cross symbols, respectively. (The detailed breakdown is plotted in Fig. S1.) A good
agreement between our DNS and the RH model is seen.

To substantiate our proposed model, in Fig. 6, we indicate on the plot 12 different control parameter combinations
(RHamb and θamb ) for which droplets with an initial size of
≈ 15µm grow (indicated by a circle symbol) or shrink (indicated by a cross symbol) in our DNS and compare with the
predictions of the model. (The profiles of d2 versus time is
provided in Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Material). By comNg et al.

paring the symbols from the DNS and the map from the model,
a clear correlation between growth and super-saturated local
RH fields can be seen. Thus we propose that this map can be
used as an indicator to determine the droplet size distributions
of a similar cough.
It is also worth noting that we did not consider the influence
of background wind, which is an important aspect both in
ventilated indoor and outdoor environments. We also stress
that we make no claims to correlate growth or shrinkage of
droplets with virus transmissions or infectivity. The subject of
the viability of droplet sizes for viral media is still the topic of
ongoing investigations in other communities and are not the
focus of this work.

this model is that with decreasing θamb , the overall axial
distance that experiences super-saturation increases. In other
words, it is more likely that with decreasing θamb (at RHamb =
90%) small droplets will encounter longer super-saturated
distances and grow in size. This likelihood to grow is important
in understanding how far the droplets can be advected by the
puff in the initial stages of the cough, before evaporating and
dispersing.
Finally, we extend our idea of modelling the axial RH to
map out the maximum local RH values for a range of
RHamb and θamb . This map is shown in Fig. 6. From the figure,
we find that the maximum local RH values are dependent on
both RHamb and θamb . Several interesting observations can
also be made from the figure. For instance, at a given indoor
ambient conditions of RHamb = 40-50% (within acceptable
occupancy comfort levels), the maximum local RH is at most
100% as long as θamb > 20◦C. However, once θamb < 20◦C,
the local RH tends to super-saturate (RH > 100%), implying
that in cooler environments, smaller droplets within the humid
puff will first undergo supersaturation-driven growth in the
early stages of the cough before evaporating upon fall-out.
Such conditions become particularly exacerbated in outdoor
environment, for example, in stadiums or sports field during
autumn or winter, when the temperatures tend to be colder.
Similar conditions can also occur in crowded bus and train
stations. Super-saturated conditions are more easily attainable (easily seen in exhaled mists) and therefore alters the
respiratory droplet dynamics.

Materials and Methods

Governing equations. We consider an incompressible flow
(∂ui /∂xi = 0) of gas phase, with both temperature and vapour
concentrations coupled to the velocity field by employing the
Boussinesq approximation. The governing equations read:

size distribution as (13, 26) with 5000 droplets. The droplets are
randomly positioned at the inlet area and evenly injected in time
with the velocity matching the local inlet velocity. Droplets are
assumed not to collide or coalesce since the estimates of the droplet
volume fractions give O(10−6 ). These droplets also do not set the
relative humidity of the puff, which at inflow is assumed to be
100%.

The notations we used in equations are as follows: ui , ui,n , and
ui,g,n are the velocity of gas, droplets, and gas at the location of
droplets, respectively. θg , θn , and θg,n are in Kelvin and used to
represent the temperature of gas, droplets, and gas at the location of
droplets, respectively. c is the vapour mass fraction, rn the droplet
radius, An the surface area of the droplets, Vn the volume of the
droplets, mn the mass of the droplets. Also p denotes the reduced
pressure. hm is the heat transfer coefficient. L is the latent heat of
vaporisation of the liquid. ρl and cp,l are the density and specific
heat capacity of the droplets assumed to consist of water. νair is
the kinematic viscosity of air. kg is the thermal conductivity of gas
which relates to the thermal diffusivity of gas Dg by kg ≡ Dg ρg cp,g .
ρg and cp,g are the density and specific heat capacity of gas, Note
that ρg cp,g = (ρa cp,a + ρv cp,v ), with ρa and ρv being the densities
of air and vapour and cp,a and cp,v being the specific heat capacities
of air and vapour. cdrop and cf luid denote the vapour mass fractions
of the droplet and the fluid at the location of the droplet. β is a
dimensionless measure of the droplet density relative to the fluid
density, and is defined as β ≡ 3ρg /(ρg + 2ρl ) − 1. fd is the prefactor
2/3
for the drag corrections defined as fd = 1 + 0.169Re drop (40).
The estimations of hm and Shdrop for a single spherical droplet
are given by the Ranz-Marshall correlations (41):

To calculate the local relative humidity, the saturated vapour
mass fraction csat,vap is determined by ideal gas law csat,vap =
Psat /(ρg Rθg ), where R is the specific gas constant of water vapour
and Psat is the saturated vapour pressure, determined through
Antoine’s relation as:

Simulation details. The computational domain size is 0.37 m (spanwise length) ×0.37 m (height) ×1.47 m (streamwise length) with
corresponding grid points chosen as 512 × 512 × 2048. We model
the mouth as a circular inlet centred at mid-height of the domain
and the cough temporal profile we apply is a gamma distribution as

Ũcough (t) = Ucough αt exp(−αt/4),
60.9 s−1 ,

[12]

where α =
such that the entire cough process lasts for
about 0.6 s. Based on an experimental measurement (13), we seeded
the respiratory event with droplets with initial diameters ranging
between 10 µm and roughly 1000 µm. We employ a similar droplet
