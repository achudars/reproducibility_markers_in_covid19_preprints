Abstract
Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to
magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users.
Methods: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on
mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment
channels included professional associations and networks, charities and social media. Quantitative findings were
reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data.
Results: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions and specialties participated. Immediate infection
control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid
adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was
cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about
many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and
social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to
understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care.
Conclusion: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions
for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a
therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in
the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.

Background
The WHO announced that COVID-19 infection was a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Countries were advised to
implement measures including social distancing, closure of schools and universities, home working and
avoidance of travel. The potential impacts of the pandemic on people’s mental health and on the mental health
care system are extensive. In the UK, a brief survey of members of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in
April 2020 predicted a ‘tsunami’ of demand in the coming weeks as people struggle to cope with COVID-19associated social and economic stressors [1]. While many general population surveys have been launched, there
has been less focus on the needs of people already living with mental health conditions, and on how mental
health services are supporting them at a time of potential staff shortages and service reconfigurations. An
editorial in The Lancet Psychiatry recognised this gap, arguing that “there has been far too little space dedicated
to the status of those with severe mental illness who would usually receive community support, or on the
problems faced on inpatient mental health units” [2].
Potential risks to provision of mental health care worldwide include staff absences due to sickness and the need
to self-isolate, and workforce redeployment, for example from community to inpatient settings. In the
community, staff in many countries have been required to limit face-to-face contacts to essential tasks such as
the administration of injectable medication [3]. In the RCPsych survey, 43% of UK psychiatrists reported an
increase in their urgent and emergency work and 45% a reduction in routine appointments [1]. Beyond the
immediate changes to services seen in the early stages of the pandemic, there are many potential challenges
that are specific to mental health care. These include difficulties in implementing infection control and social
distancing guidance in settings where people may be very distressed or cognitively impaired [4], especially in
mental health wards and the supported accommodation settings where many people with complex mental
health problems live [5]. Face-to-face meetings are usually central to mental health care: severe restrictions to
this seem likely to greatly alter staff and service user experiences. There is also a considerable risk that, even
after restrictions are lifted, there will be a lasting exacerbation of health and social inequalities that affect
people with longer-term mental health problems, for example, through increased economic disadvantage,
inequalities in health care, or sequelae of increased trauma and abuse [6,7].
Since the start of the pandemic, experts from around the world have published views about potential negative
impacts of the pandemic on mental health services [3,8,9] and the suggestion has also been recurrently made
that it could provide an opportunity for positive service developments [10,11,12]. However, to date there has
been no research directly assessing and reporting the experiences and perspectives of those currently working

in the mental health system. Our aim was to inform further research and service responses by conducting, in the
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey of the perspectives and experiences of staff working in
inpatient and community settings across the UK health and social care sectors.

Methods
The King’s College London research ethics committee approved this study (MRA-19/20-18372), which involved
mental health staff in the UK completing an online questionnaire.

Study design
In the absence of a measure of pandemic impact on mental health care and mental health service users, we
rapidly developed an online questionnaire to collect cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative data from
mental health care staff.

Participants
All staff working in face-to-face mental health care in the UK, or managing those who provide such care, were
eligible to participate. All specialties were included, as were NHS, private healthcare, social care and voluntary
sector services.

Questionnaire: Development
The lead developer of the questionnaire, SJ, an academic and practising inner London psychiatrist, read key
sources identified in an accompanying rapid review of relevant literature [13], including academic and
professional journals, news media, and organisational websites, and followed relevant social media topics. The
drafting of the questionnaire was further informed by the NIHR Mental Health Policy Research Unit (PRU)
working group for this study (about 30 people, including clinicians, researchers and people with relevant lived
experience), and the PRU Lived Experience Working Group. Both groups discussed the study at online meetings
and identified important topics for inclusion. Nine further clinicians provided email summaries of the challenges
they were currently facing and how they were being addressed.

Feedback was obtained from the PRU working group on a first draft of the questionnaire, together with
additional input from experts in fields including mental health care for older people, children and adolescents,
people with drug and alcohol problems, offenders, and people with intellectual disabilities. The questionnaire
was revised and converted into an online format using the UCL Opinio platform. Pilot testing was then
conducted with 17 clinicians who provided feedback on the length, acceptability and relevance of the
questionnaire and on problems with specific items. Following this, a final version of the questionnaire was
agreed.

Questionnaire: Content
A mixture of structured and open-ended questions was included. Participants were asked which sector and
region they worked in but not which organisation, maximising anonymity. Participants could skip questions if
they wished, and internet cookies were used to prevent participants completing multiple questionnaires. A
branching structure was adopted, with initial questions asking all participants to rate the relevance of each item
on lists of:

-

Challenges at work during the COVID-19 pandemic

-

Problems currently faced by mental health service users and family carers (from a staff perspective)

-

Sources of help at work in managing the impact of the pandemic

This was followed by sections for staff in specific settings and specialties. Questions also elicited details of
adaptations and innovations introduced to manage the impact of the pandemic, and their perceived success,
and enquired about concerns for the future and any aspects of current practice that they would like to keep
after the pandemic. A copy of the survey is available at this web address: https://opinio.ucl.ac.uk/s?s=67819.

Recruitment
Our aim was to achieve rapid recruitment of a large and varied sample by dissemination through multiple
channels including:
-

Professional networks, for example support from the Mental Health Nurse Academics UK, Unite in
Health, Royal College of Psychiatrists and Royal College of Nurses.

-

Social media, especially Twitter. Our partner, the Mental Elf, promoted the study frequently and advised
us on social media strategy.

-

Relevant mental health-focused bodies, including our partner the Centre for Mental Health and the
Association of Mental Health Providers.

In the final week of recruitment, we targeted under-represented sectors, including relevant voluntary sector
organisations and supported housing providers. We also sought to increase representation of staff from Black,
Asian and Minority Ethnic groups by focused social media recruitment via the Mental Elf, including a video in
which a prominent Black psychiatrist encouraged participation, and contact with the networks of PRU
researchers who work on issues of diversity.

Analysis
Quantitative data: Our main aim was to give an overview of the current impact of the pandemic: we produced
descriptive statistics using Stata 15 to summarise relevant aspects of the quantitative data. Missing data are
reported in the footnotes of the relevant tables.
Qualitative data: An analytical coding framework was developed guided by the study research questions,
quantitative analysis results and themes emerging from initial survey responses. The responses to open-ended
questions were left unedited and compiled into coding matrices in Microsoft Excel, with the emerging codes in
the columns and cases in rows. Descriptive content analysis was then conducted, and all survey responses were
indexed [14].

Findings
We summarise key findings concisely here: our accompanying Supplementary report gives much more detail.
Data were collected from 22 April 2020 to 12 May 2020. In total, 3,712 people started the survey (including
many who clicked ‘Start’ but provided no or minimal data) and 1,793 got to the end. We report results for
participants who completed at least one question from each of the three main sections open to all respondents.
This produced a sample of 2,180. There were 15,010 responses to open-ended items, yielding 295,751 words for
rapid qualitative content analysis.

Participant characteristics
A large majority of participants worked in the NHS (1,935, 88.9%). Approximately a third described themselves
as nurses (664, 30.6%), 347 as psychologists (16.0%), 254 as psychiatrists (11.7%), 97 as social workers (4.5%)
and 80 as peer support workers (3.7%). Over a third identified as a manager or lead clinician in their service
(826, 38.0%). Over two-thirds worked with working age adults (1,521, 70.0%), 39.2% worked with older adults
(853), just under a third worked with people with learning disabilities (648, 29.8%), around a fifth worked with
people with drug and alcohol problems (456, 21.0%) and another fifth worked with people with eating disorders
(451, 20.7%). Participants could report working with multiple service user populations or in multiple settings.
The majority worked in England (1,814, 83.4%) with around a third of those in England based in London (639,
35.3%) and a fifth in the North West (328, 18.1%). Four-fifths were female (1,378, 80.0%) and almost nine-tenths
were from white ethnic groups (1,433, 87.0%). Full demographic details, including age, caring responsibilities
and COVID-19 status, can be found in Table 1x of the Supplementary report (references to tables in the
Supplementary report are herein indicated with an ‘x’ after the table number to distinguish them from tables in
the main text).

type of setting and Tables 2x-6x report this in further detail. In inpatient wards and crisis houses, infection
control challenges, related to both service users and staff becoming infected, were rated highest, alongside
increased boredom and agitation amongst service users due to lack of activity and contact on the ward. Crisis
service staff rated as most relevant lack of services to which they could refer on or signpost. Community team
staff rated items related to changes in ways of working and adoption of remote technologies highest, along with
reduced availability of other services. The small group of residential service participants gave a high relevance
rating to their environment being more challenging because residents cannot go out and/or engage in usual
activities. Table 29x shows ratings by profession and Table 30x shows ratings by managerial roles. There were
fewer obvious differences by profession than by setting, but managers and lead clinicians more often reported
challenges relating to supporting colleagues with stressors due to the pandemic, and increased workload during
the pandemic as very or extremely relevant (51.5% and 40.6%, respectively) compared to those not in these
roles (31.8% and 21.3%, respectively).

Half of staff in inpatient and residential settings reported they could not consistently follow the rules set on
infection control (303, 50.5%), and just over a third reported they could not do this in community and other
settings (518, 35.2%). Table 2 shows the impediments to this most often identified from qualitative content
analysis of responses, with more detail in Tables 7x-8x. Tensions between meeting clinical needs and infection
control were reported across settings, for example in responding to emergencies on wards or when service
users in the community needed home visits, on which infection control measures were very difficult to
implement. The built environment was the most frequently cited challenge in the community, and ward layouts
impeded infection control in hospital. In each setting there were also reports of conflicting or unclear guidance.
Reports of not having the facilities and processes to adhere to guidance, for example, in putting on and
disposing of personal protective equipment (PPE), were especially prominent in the community. Unclear or
conflicting guidance and procedures, and service users who are unable to understand and adhere to infection
control rules, were reported across settings. Substantial numbers were also concerned about perceived conflicts
between protective equipment and therapeutic relationships, for example, when trying to engage service users
with paranoid ideas while wearing a mask.

Service activity
We also asked participants to report, if data were available to them, the extent of activity change in the service
in which they worked (Table 9x). Responses varied but reports of reduced activity considerably exceeded those
of increased activity, especially regarding inpatient admissions (though less so for compulsory admissions) and
new referrals to crisis services and community services. However, in community services, including psychological
treatment services, similar numbers of staff said they were having more weekly contacts as said they were
having fewer.

Table 3 summarises staff perceptions of the current relevance of various types of potential difficulty for the
service users and carers with whom they were in contact (Table 10x reports this in greater detail and by service
user group). Across all groups, staff tended to rate social difficulties as most relevant, for example, loneliness
and a lack of usual support from family and friends. Several other types of problem were also rated by many
staff as very or extremely relevant, including lack of normal support from mental health and other services,
deterioration in mental health in the pandemic period, worries about infection and being at high risk if infected.

TABLE 4: Frequently cited examples of the groups of service users about whom staff participants have been
especially concerned during the pandemic: qualitative content analysis of open-ended responses
(See Table 11x in the Supplementary report for further details)
People with conditions resulting in specific concerns
•

People who are cognitively impaired (e.g. due to dementia or learning disability), who may find situation
hard to understand and struggle to follow guidance
• People with psychotic symptoms that may be exacerbated by current events and interfere with their
ability to follow guidance
• People with complex emotional needs (who may have a “personality disorder” diagnosis), who may be
destabilised by abrupt loss of support and routines;
• People with anxiety or OCD, especially those for whom COVID-19 interacts with contamination-related
symptoms
• Women with perinatal mental health problems, lacking usual support and assessment around the time of
birth
• People with drug and alcohol problems, for whom treatment and support are often severely disrupted and
following guidance may be difficult
• People with eating disorders, at risk from disruption to usual eating, exercise and social routines and to
food access
People of concern due to impacts related to social circumstances or characteristics
• People who live alone/are currently socially isolated and lonely
• Older people with mental health problems, due to loss of usual support (e.g. family visits) and additional
physical health vulnerability
• People who are in households where there is domestic violence or conflict
• Children in homes that may not be safe or where there is family conflict
• People living in poverty/poor housing, or who are homeless, for whom the lockdown is especially difficulty
People of particular concern due to service disruptions
• Inpatients who have experienced service disruptions, including precipitate discharge, delayed discharge
because of infection concerns, lack of leave or visits, and increased isolation and lack of activity or
therapies on the wards
• People who are difficult to reach in the community without usual visiting/outreach/face to face
appointments and may not be seeking help that is needed
• People at risk because of disrupted availability of medical responses e.g. for people who harm themselves
and are discouraged from/reluctant to visit emergency departments

Responding to open-ended questions, staff identified a range of groups of service users about whom they were
currently particularly concerned, some because of impacts on their clinical condition, others because of their
social characteristics or circumstances, or because of specific difficulties providing an adequate service for them.
Table 4 summarises groups frequently identified as of particular concern, and Supplementary Table 11x gives
more detail.

We also asked staff whether they were seeing people with mental health difficulties that appeared to arise from
the pandemic (Table 12x). Some described symptoms directly related to COVID-19, such as delusional beliefs
regarding COVID-19 infection or quarantine, and health anxiety or obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to
infection. Others described relapses in people who had long been stable that they felt were linked to the
stresses of the crisis. Some also reported apparently first presentations of mental health problems such as
psychosis or mania among healthcare workers.

Table 5 summarises responses to a question about which sources of help were currently most important to staff
in managing the impact of COVID-19 at work. Across all professions, the most important sources of help were
support and advice from employers, colleagues and managers, closely followed by new digital ways of working
and the resilience and coping skills of service users and carers, the latter presumably seen as making the crisis

less burdensome for staff, at least at its onset. Patterns of response were not markedly different across
professional groups (Tables 13x-14x).

Service changes and adaptations
Participants in crisis and community services were asked whether services they worked in had changed opening
hours or locations, and how their practices had changed (Table 15x). Services that had increased their hours
during the crisis, for example with weekend opening, were described, as well as reductions in other services.
Most staff working in crisis services reported that home visits were continuing when strictly necessary. A
mixture of responses was obtained from community services (including both community mental health teams
and psychological treatment services), with some reporting continuing face-to-face contacts and home visits as
needed, others having stopped them. Responses regarding psychological treatment were split between aiming
to provide a full treatment by video call or phone, and providing abbreviated contacts only.
Open-ended questions elicited reports of adaptations and innovations made to manage the impact of the
pandemic (Table 16x). The most widely reported shift was greatly increased adoption of remote technologies, as
discussed below. Some participants also reported adopting new digital tools for assessment and therapy, such as
apps and websites. Other innovations included new crisis services, such as crisis assessment centres rapidly
established as alternatives to hospital emergency departments and new crisis phone lines, and re-organised
services, resulting in extended hours, increased access for specific groups or shorter waiting lists (e.g. for
psychological treatment). Reported changes in the types of help offered included community services arranging
practical help, such as food deliveries for service users, and providing resource packs to help service users to be
active at home. Also frequently described were new or expanded forms of support for staff, including ‘wobble’
rooms (quiet rooms for staff who feel overwhelmed), staff helplines, increased supervision, wellness check-ins,
and more use of informal support mechanisms.
Also reported was a general shift towards a more flexible approach, reducing bureaucracy and removing barriers
to change, leading to a more agile way of working and a more responsive service. Many staff also valued the
many benefits to their wellbeing, productivity and efficiency in being able to conduct some of their client
contact or administrative tasks away from the office.

What’s working and what’s not in remote working: qualitative analysis of open-ended responses
TABLE 6: Key points on remote working – what’s working well and what’s not
(See Tables 17x-19x in the Supplementary report for further details)
What’s working well in tele-health

What can prevent tele-health from working

•

•

Efficiency of remote working:
o Allows prompt responses
o Saves travelling time
o Is better for the environment
o May be more convenient for both staff and
service users
o Allows staff to connect easily with each other,
even if based in different places and different
teams
o Allows home working
• Best alternative for now:
o Remote working is allowing services to keep
going despite infection control restrictions
o Innovative use of IT and digital tools can allow
group programmes or individual therapies to
continue successfully
• Benefits for some clients:
o some clients are happy with video-call
technology and even prefer it
o Access is improved for some people, especially if
travel and public places are challenging
o May be an efficient way of helping people with
less complex needs

Inadequate resources:
o Equipment and internet connections of low
quality
o Processes and preferred platforms not clearly
established.
o Staff may lack training and confidence
• Impacts on communication and therapeutic
relationships
o May be harder to establish and maintain a good
therapeutic relationship
o May be harder to make an assessment,
especially at first contact
o May be challenging for longer, more in-depth
sessions
• Digital exclusion:
o People who lack equipment and resources to
connect
o People who don’t have skills or confidence to
connect (including people with cognitive
impairments)
o People lacking a suitably private environment for
remote appointments
• Service user preferences:
o Some service users strongly prefer confidential
conversations to be face-to-face, or may feel
suspicious or anxious about remote means
o If they do accept remote contacts, some prefer
simpler phone or messaging modalities
o Some service users do not engage with remote
contacts

Further quantitative and open-ended questions explored views and experiences of the shift to remote working
(Tables 17x-19x). Almost all staff in community services (1,011, 94.1%), and a large majority in crisis services
(219, 83.0%), were replacing some face-to-face contacts with phone or video calls. The shift to video calls did

17

not appear to have been very extensive, however, with the majority (475, 54.5%) reporting use of this
technology for 20% or fewer of their patient contacts.
Views about this were mixed. Video calls for communication between staff attracted the greatest enthusiasm,
with more than two-thirds (815, 73.4%) from both community and crisis services agreeing or strongly agreeing
that they are a good way to hold staff meetings; this was echoed in open-ended questions. A majority (818,
74.0% of respondents to this question) agreed or strongly agreed that video calls were a good way to assess
progress of some people already known to the service, but only 39.8% (442) agreed or strongly agreed that they
can be a good way of making initial assessments.
Responses to open-ended questions (Table 6, Tables 18x-19x) likewise identified concerns about being able to
make a good assessment remotely, as well as about forming rapport: they tended to suggest digital technologies
were useful for clients with less complex needs, for “light-touch” interventions or for low intensity therapeutic
approaches and follow-up appointments. A majority (725, 65.8%) agreed or strongly agreed that use of remote
rather than face-to-face consultations had resulted in not having contact with some service users who had not
engaged with remote appointments. Other impediments to remote working, identified through open-ended
questions (Table 19x), included accessibility issues for service users with cognitive impairments or dementia, or
who lack access to appropriate technology, relevant skills or privacy at home, and outdated or scarce IT
equipment within services.

Future hopes and concerns
67.8% answered yes to a question asking whether they wished to retain longer term any of the changes made
during the pandemic. Table 20x summarises qualitative analysis of responses. A large majority involved keeping
some aspects of remote working, with many feeling that selective use of technology platforms to connect staff
with each other and with service users has potential long-term benefits for efficiency and the environment,
particularly if technical difficulties are resolved and appropriate protocols developed. Others wished to retain
some new service initiatives, such as crisis centres in the community, or the increased flexibility and ease of
making changes experienced at this time.
Responses to a question about concerns for the future were numerous and detailed (Table 21x). While many
participants reported that referrals to their service had decreased in the early phase of the pandemic, many
feared that need would increase significantly in future and that lack of capacity and staff burnout may impede
18

response to this. Anticipated drivers of increased future need included traumas, bereavement and complex grief
experienced by frontline staff, service users and the wider public; mental health problems not managed
effectively among people who have disengaged or not sought help during the pandemic; increased levels of
domestic abuse and family conflict; and the effects of wider societal disruption and increased inequalities due,
for example, to unemployment and homelessness. Fears were also expressed that reduced levels of service
might persist inappropriately after the current emergency period, that changes made in response to the crisis
might be used to justify reduced funding in future, or that staff would be expected to continue with working
patterns that they had agreed to only because of the crisis. Extension of remote working beyond the
circumstances in which it had proved helpful was a further concern. Several respondents were concerned about
the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic staff and service users, and
about potentially increased racism and xenophobia.

Discussion
A wide range of challenges are being experienced across the mental health sector, some specific to service
settings or groups of service users and carers. While many commentators have predicted a significant and
widespread impact of COVID-19, we are able to provide a more detailed report that is rooted in direct
experience of the effects of the pandemic on mental health care, albeit only in one country and only from the
perspective of practitioners.
In the context of the pandemic, infection control is an immediate need whose complexity in mental health
settings is a significant finding from our study. Lack of PPE was sometimes identified as a problem. More
prominent, however, were challenges relating to processes, to the physical environment in which mental health
care is delivered, and to tensions between infection control requirements and providing safe care and
maintaining therapeutic relationships with people who may be distressed, suspicious or struggling to
comprehend the situation. Inpatient and residential services, and crisis services, where continuing face-to-face
contacts appear more frequent than in routine care, are not surprisingly the settings in which staff are most
immediately concerned with the spread of infection: the price of failure is potentially very high, as indicated by a
recent Care Quality Commission report on excess deaths related to COVID-19 among people subject to the
Mental Health Act [15].
The shift to remote working, strikingly rapid given that telehealth has been discussed over many years but with
limited implementation, has been widely discussed; we examine staff perspectives on this in detail in the current
19

study. Both our quantitative and qualitative data suggest clear support for its partial adoption in the longer
term: remote contacts are seen as valuable for staff meetings, and for convenient and environmentally friendly
follow-up of well-engaged clients with access to and a positive view of technology. However, staff give a very
clear warning that there are still important technological, social and procedural barriers to be addressed, and
that its use should remain selective, complementing rather than replacing face-to-face contact.
This and other innovations that we document above suggest that, as in other domains of healthcare, there has
been considerable agility and flexibility in at least some service contexts during the current crisis, with urgent
needs overcoming well-documented barriers to implementing new ways of working. However, while responses
to our question about innovations that staff would like to retain were numerous, serious concerns regarding
both the short and long-term future were also widely expressed: these data were collected at a very early stage
in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Limitations
This is only one perspective on the impact of the pandemic on mental health care, albeit one rooted in direct
experience: it will be essential to investigate service user and carer perspectives, and to measure impacts on the
mental health system more systematically as further data become available. Given the unprecedented pace of
change in the world and in mental health services, we prioritised gaining a broad overview of impacts and
responses, but much detail will have been missed. Our questionnaire was by necessity an ad hoc and not an
established and validated tool. Our sample, gathered by disseminating our questionnaire through a range of
channels, is not representative of those who work in mental health care settings, and may either over-represent
people who have strong concerns about the situation or those who wish to report successful new practices. We
managed to include a range of professions and work settings but did not recruit as successfully as we had hoped
outside the NHS – more targeted efforts and time are likely to be needed to reach relevant staff from other
sectors. Many people with mental health difficulties also come into contact with GPs, pharmacists, paramedics,
and A&E doctors and nurses, especially if they are not under secondary services; we have not included these
perspectives. We are especially concerned that, while we do not have any definitive overall figure for the UK
mental health care workforce, it is clear that the number of non-White participants in our survey is relatively
small, despite targeted efforts to increase their number and a strong emphasis on anonymity and
confidentiality, as advised in previous discussions of this frequently experienced difficulty [16]. Further efforts to
engage and form partnerships are likely to be needed here too.

Implications
We present here a series of snapshots capturing, from a staff perspective, the situation in mental health care
services in the rapidly evolving early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This work cannot yield definitive answers
and should be interpreted alongside other perspectives, but offers researchers, services and policymakers
directions for service development and further rapid research. Regarding immediate priorities, our findings
point to specific challenges to be addressed to achieve more successful infection control. Remote working is a
further immediate focus for research and service developments. Participants’ accounts suggest that it has been
helpful in keeping services going and maintaining some level of contact in the community, and for
communication between staff, but that there is now a need to develop clearer processes in collaboration with
service users for its targeted use, to implement guidance and evidence that already exists, and to explore ways
of overcoming barriers to its effective use. Finally, we suggest that our findings are a mixture of the predictable
and the unpredictable, for example, in relation to levels of service activity. They indicate that it will be essential
to continue to observe carefully what is occurring in mental health care settings around the world, tailoring
responses to real needs and pressures, not to predictions and expectations.

Lived experience commentary: Rachel Rowan Olive and Tamar Jeynes
It is reassuring to see that staff share many of our concerns about the Covid-19 pandemic: premature
discharges, isolation, difficulties with infection control and accessing care. Many of these are reflected in the
MadCovid project’s materials (https://madcovid.com/).
Telemedicine drew mixed views from staff; we would like to highlight some difficulties. Not everyone has a safe
space to speak, may only have privacy in their bedroom or none at all. Telemedicine works better for those in
better, not-overcrowded housing, so risks widening inequalities in access to care. For many of us, our home is
our safety, and it is important to have distressing conversations elsewhere. Leaving the therapy room, we can
leave some of our trauma behind. Videocalls may feel invasive - as though the clinician is in your bedroom bringing up traumatic issues inside the home, where we cannot escape them. Any continuation of remote
working will need to consider the safety implications of this, assessing its suitability for each individual.

It is vital that difficulty adhering to infection control guidance does not lead to blaming inpatients for viral
spread. This is particularly important with restraint, where staff mentioned struggling to put on appropriate PPE
in time to deal with an unfolding emergency. Wide area variations in restraint rates
(https://www.mind.org.uk/media-a/4378/physical_restraint_final_web_version.pdf [17];
https://weareagenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Restraint-FOI-research-briefing-FINAL1.pdf [18]),
alongside personal experience, make us question whether restraint is ever truly unavoidable. If it places both
staff and service users at risk of Covid-19 infection it is doubly dangerous. However challenging the situation,
efforts must be renewed to reduce the iatrogenic distress, fear and anger which can lead to its use.
Historically slow-moving services have implemented change at breakneck speeds in response to this crisis
despite significant difficulties. Service users have campaigned for changes for decades. It is time to implement
these changes with the same urgency.

Acknowledgments
We are very grateful to Seena Fazel (University of Oxford), Angela Hassiotis and Gill Livingston (both University
College London) for their contributions to the development of survey questions in their specialist areas (forensic
psychiatry, older people, and intellectual disability, respectively), and to Dr Lade Smith for her help in promoting
the survey, especially by making a video with the Mental Elf encouraging staff from Black and minority ethnic
groups to participate. We also thank the clinicians who took time to complete and feed back on our pilot survey,
and all participants for taking time from the pressures of the pandemic to respond to the crisis.
