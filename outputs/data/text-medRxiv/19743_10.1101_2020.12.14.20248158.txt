ABSTRACT
We introduce a deep learning framework that can detect
COVID-19 pneumonia in thoracic radiographs, as well as
differentiate it from bacterial pneumonia infection. Deep
classification models, such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), require large-scale datasets in order to be trained and
perform properly. Since the number of X-ray samples related to
COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning (TL) appears as the go-to
method to alleviate the demand for training data and develop
accurate automated diagnosis models. In this context, networks
are able to gain knowledge from pretrained networks on largescale image datasets or alternative data-rich sources (i.e.
bacterial and viral pneumonia radiographs). The experimental
results indicate that the TL approach outperforms the
performance obtained without TL, for the COVID-19
classification task in chest X-ray images.

1 INTRODUCTION
The first human cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019. Given its rapid spread, a month later,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared novel

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) a public health emergency of
international concern [1] and a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [2].
The COVID-19 pandemic, as of September 27, 2020, has resulted
in over 33 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths
worldwide [3], causing significant socio-economic repercussions
on people's livelihoods [4]. Just for the sake of comparison, the
SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 caused 774 deaths in 26 countries,
with a total of 8,098 infected people [5], [6].
Although the COVID-19 disease can cause multi-organ
damages [7], the lungs are the most affected organs of the
human body, due to their abundance of angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor that acts as the door,
through which the virus is able to enter the host cells [8].
Therefore, the lungs are the focal point of the human body, for
the COVID-19 implications detection.
On this basis, the role of chest radiography in the diagnosis of
COVID-19 disease is crucial. In particular, like other types of
pneumonia (e.g. bacterial pneumonia), on thoracic Χ-rays of
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, is observed an increased
(whiter) density of lungs. Usually, the more severe the disease,
the more intense the whiteness on the chest X-rays. In the
typical case, ground-glass opacity occurs, with possible
simultaneous existence of linear opacities (e.g. peripheral
horizontal white lines), resulting in slightly obscured lung
markings (Figure 1a). It is underlined that in severe cases the
lung markings become invisible due to the dense whiteness, a

phenomenon known as consolidation (Figure 1b) [9]. Hence,
utilizing chest radiography, or combining it with laboratory and
clinical assessment, can be an efficient tool for the early and
accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

During the last few years, the use of deep learning
applications in medical imaging analysis has received much
attention from the scientific community, surpassing in many
cases the performance of medical professionals [11]. The
pneumonia detection task on chest radiography can be
interpreted as a computer vision classification problem, where
the input is a thoracic X-ray image and the output indicates the
existence or the absence of the infection. In this context, several
studies have proven that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
show great performance on various image classification tasks,
such as the one investigated in this paper [12], [13].
However, the main problem that arises in such techniques is
the requirement for large-scale datasets in order to train and
evaluate the classifiers [14]–[16]. At the time of writing this
paper, the number of X-ray samples related to COVID-19 is
extremely limited, hence transfer learning is a preferable method
in order to train efficiently the deep CNNs [17]. More
specifically, with transfer learning, we are able to avoid the
training of the deep models from scratch and also the lack of
training data, by taking advantage of the extraction of
knowledge from other alternative tasks.
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the efficacy of
the state-of-the-art deep CNNs, trained through transfer
learning, in giving accurate pneumonia diagnosis from frontalview chest X-rays. The proposed models will be evaluated
according to their performance in detecting traces of COVID-19
infection in the patients’ thoracic X-ray images, in conjunction
with their ability to differentiate the specific patients from those
infected with bacterial pneumonia.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
briefly presents related work on applications of deep learning
frameworks in medical imaging. Section 3 outlines the proposed
computer vision methods for pneumonia classification, and

Recent developments in deep learning applications,
availability of large datasets and advances in the computing
power have led algorithms to be a powerful auxiliary tool in the
hands of medical professionals. Several studies have been carried
out, emphasizing the high performance of deep models in a wide
variety of medical imaging applications, such as, for instance,
detection of diabetic retinopathy [18], identification of
arrhythmia [19], early prognostication of Alzheimer’s disease
dementia [20], diagnosis of brain hemorrhage [21], and
classification of various types of cancer (e.g. breast [22], skin
[23], brain [24], and prostate [25]).
Automated diagnosis of various chest diseases using
radiographs has been gaining momentum, due to the latest
breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and the
dramatic increase in available public thoracic X-ray datasets [26].
In detail, deep learning algorithms are increasingly set to become
a key factor in pediatric pneumonia diagnosis [27] and
classification of pulmonary tuberculosis [28]. Moreover, in the
work of [29], the authors developed a deep model, based on the
DenseNet-121 architecture, which is able to accurately detect the
presence of 14 different thoracic pathologies, using chest
radiographs. It is noted that their analysis has found that the
deep learning algorithm has reached or even surpassed the
performance level of clinical assessment by human radiologists,
on 11 out of the 14 pathologies.

2.1 Our Contribution
Inspired by the above research work, in this paper, we
introduce a deep learning framework that can detect COVID-19
pneumonia in thoracic X-rays. Considering the pandemic
outbreak, the proposed framework aims to fill the gap between
the limited number of highly skilled radiologists and the growing
need for chest X-ray interpretation.

3 PROBLEM FORMULATION AND PROPOSED
METHODOLOGY
3.1 Problem Formulation
Automated pneumonia diagnosis, based on chest X-ray
images, is a computer vision problem that can be addressed as a
(i) classification [11], [13], [35], (ii) object detection [36], [37], or
(iii) semantic segmentation task [38], [39]. In the first procedure,
the output of the deep learning model indicates the existence or
the absence of the infection, in a given X-ray image. In the
second method, the algorithm provides bounding boxes that
indicate the location and the dimensions of the infected areas, in
the patient's lung. The latter approach involves pixel-based
classification methods (e.g. Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)
[40], U-Nets [41], and Mask R-CNN [42]), thus defining precisely
the shape of the symptomatic areas.
In this paper, we address the problem of pneumonia detection
as a multi-class classification task. The input 𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑤×ℎ×3 of the
problem is an RGB frontal-view thoracic X-ray image, with
dimensions 𝑤 × ℎ , and the output 𝑦 ∈ {0, 1, 2} denotes
respectively the absence of pneumonia, the bacterial pneumonia
infection, or the COVID-19 pneumonia infection.

3.2 Dataset Description
In this paper, we are using two different datasets, consisted of
exclusively frontal-view chest X-ray images of various
resolutions, ranging from 220×206 to 5623×4757.
The first dataset, referred as Dataset_0, comes from the work
of Kermnay et al. [30] and includes 1,575 X-ray images of
healthy patients (Figure 2a), 2,772 images of patients with
bacterial pneumonia (Figure 2b) and 1,493 images of patients
with viral pneumonia (Figure 2c). Dataset_0 was used for
training a multi-class classification model, which will be
targeting three classes: (i) normal healthy patients, (ii) patients

with pneumonia caused by bacteria, (iii) patients with
pneumonia caused by a virus.
The second dataset, referred as Dataset_1, consists of thoracic
X-ray images of confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure 2d) that
come from the COVID-19 image data collection of Cohen et al.
[10], as well as a subset of the aforementioned Dataset_0. More
specifically, Dataset_1 contains 544 images of healthy patients,
500 images of patients with bacterial pneumonia and 456 images
of patients with COVID-19. It is underlined that through the
undersampling process of the normal and bacterial classes, we
can avoid imbalanced data problems, since at the time of writing
this paper the number of X-ray samples for the COVID-19 class
is extremely limited. From the whole number of chest X-ray
images in Dataset_1, 80% is used for training the deep learning
multi-class classification models, while the rest 20% is used for
testing. Among the training data, 87.5% of them were used for
training and the remaining 12.5% for validation.

3.3 Transfer Learning
The idea of transfer learning lies in the fact that, in machine
learning, we can utilize knowledge gained from one problem A
and then apply it to another related problem B [31]. For instance,
knowledge obtained while learning to detect cats can be
transferred when trying to detect dogs. It is emphasized that,
generally speaking, transfer learning is more effective when
tasks A and B are relatively correlated, since then, they possess
similar low-level image features (e.g. edges, lines, corners, and
curves) [32].
Furthermore, through transfer learning, we are able to create
accurate deep models on small datasets, by leveraging existing
networks, already trained on large datasets. Thus, instead of
training our network from scratch, we can utilize these
pretrained models, the low-level features of which are pretty
generic, and therefore can be used in any image classification
task [14], [33].
Based on the above and given the limited data of COVID-19
X-ray images, transfer learning is the preferred method, in order
to develop accurate automated diagnosis models [17]. In this
way, we are able to overcome the isolated learning paradigm of
COVID-19 and utilize knowledge from other data-rich sources,
such as the bacterial and viral pneumonia radiographs.
Additionally, we leverage pretrained networks on large-scale
image datasets, such as the ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet [34],
and transfer their generic knowledge into our pneumonia
classification problem.

evaluated using an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU, provided by Google
Colab.
We trained the CNNs, using batches of size 20, for 500
epochs, with early stopping criteria set to 10 epochs, to avoid
overfitting. During data preprocessing, we resized input images
to a resolution of 224 × 224 pixels.
All the models were trained using Adam optimizer with the
default parameters (𝛽1 = 0.9 and 𝛽2 = 0.999), with an initial
learning rate of 0.001 that is reduced by a factor of 10 when
there is no improvement in the validation loss, for five
consecutive epochs. Regarding Model_2 and Molel_3, to which
were applied transfer learning techniques, initially we tuned
only the weights of the final dense layer and froze the rest of the
networks. Then, we unfroze the whole Model_2 and the last 11
layers of Model_3 and continued the training procedure in order
to fine-tune the reused layers. It is highlighted that after
unfreezing the reused layers, the learning rate was initially set to
0.0001, in order to prevent damaging the reused weights. Lastly,
during the models’ training process, we optimize the categorical
cross-entropy loss

In order to detect pneumonia cases from chest X-ray images,
we designed a simple CNN, the architecture of which is depicted
in Figure 3. Initially, a CNN, referred as Model_0 and based on
the specific architecture, was trained on Dataset_0. Model_0 is
able to classify the following three classes: (i) normal, (ii)
bacterial pneumonia, and (iii) viral pneumonia. Then, two CNNs,
based on the same architecture, were trained on Dataset_1: the
first model, referred as Model_1, was trained from scratch using
random initial weights, whereas the second model, referred as
Model_2, was trained using transfer learning from Model_0.
Finally, a ResNet-50 network, referred as Model_3, was also
trained on Dataset_1, initialized with weights pretrained on
ImageNet [34]. It is noted that the last fully connected layer of
the ResNet-50 is replaced by one that can identify three classes
instead of 1000. The last three models are able to classify the
following three classes: (i) normal, (ii) bacterial pneumonia, and
(iii) COVID-19 pneumonia.

accuracy and 92.46% F1-score), by utilizing knowledge from
other similar sources (i.e. viral pneumonia). This implies that
through transfer learning the error rate of the deep learning
model, which is demonstrated in Figure 3, was reduced to a
factor of almost two.

4.2 Results
To test the proposed approaches, we consider four
performance metrics, to evaluate the results of the deep models
on the test set of Dataset_1: (i) prediction, which measures the
correctness of positive predictions (ii) recall, which refers to the
ratio of total relevant instances correctly classified by the
network, (iii) accuracy, which shows the proportion of correct
predictions to the total predictions made by the classifier, and
(iv) F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Figure 4 depicts the performance metrics in terms of
precision and recall, for the test set of Dataset_1. More
specifically, Model_1, which was trained from scratch performed
reasonably well (93.03% precision and 92.17% recall) in the
classification task. However, Model_2, which has a matching
architecture with Model_1, but trained by utilizing transfer
learning techniques, provides improved results, achieving 95.69%
precision and 95.62% recall. Lastly, Model_3 (ResNet-50
pretrained on ImageNet dataset) results in even better outcomes
(97.73% precision and 97.67% recall), due to (i) its more complex
architecture, and (ii) the transfer learning capabilities, enabled by
the pretrained model.
Figure 5 illustrates the performance metrics in terms of
accuracy and F1-score, for the test set of Dataset_1. Similar to
the above, Model_3 achieved the highest scores (97.66% accuracy
and 97.61% F1-score). At the same time, Model_2 (95.65%

In this paper, we have presented a deep learning-based
approach for automated detection of COVID-19 pneumonia in
thoracic X-ray images. In parallel, the proposed networks
differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia.
Bearing in mind that the number of chest radiographs related to
COVID-19 is limited, transfer learning can contribute to
effectively train the deep models, by transferring knowledge
from other data-rich sources and pretrained networks. The
results of this study indicate that the transfer learning approach
outperforms the performance obtained without transfer learning,
for the COVID-19 classification task.
