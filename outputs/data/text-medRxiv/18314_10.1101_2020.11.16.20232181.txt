Abstract
Background
During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been health concerns
related to alcohol use and misuse. Therefore, the World Health Organization cautioned that
alcohol consumption during the pandemic might have a negative impact. The aim of this study
was to examine the population-level change in cases of alcohol-related liver disease and
pancreatitis that required admission during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods
We included patients aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized between July 2018 and June
2020 using Diagnostic Procedure Combination data, an administrative database in Japan, and
counted the admission cases whose primary diagnosis was alcohol-related liver disease or
pancreatitis. We defined the period from April 2020, when the Japanese government declared a
state of emergency, as the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. The rate ratio (RR) of
admissions with alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis per 1,000 admissions was tested
using interrupted time series analysis. In addition, excess admissions for alcohol-related liver
disease or pancreatitis were calculated.
Results
Overall admissions were 3,026,389 cases, and a total of 10,242 admissions for alcohol-related
liver disease or pancreatitis occurred from 257 hospitals. The rate of admissions per 1,000
admissions during the COVID-19 outbreak period (April 2020 to June 2020) had a 1.2 times
increase compared with the pre-outbreak period (July 2018 to March 2020) for cases of alcoholrelated liver disease or pancreatitis (RR: 1.22, 95%Confidence interval [CI]: 1.12 to 1.33). The

COVID-19 pandemic caused about 214.75 (95%CI: 178.78 to 249.72) excess admissions for
alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis based on predictions from our model.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 outbreak might have resulted in increased hospital admissions for alcoholrelated liver disease or pancreatitis.

INTRODUCTION
Alcohol misuse is a major public health concern that causes about 3 million deaths worldwide
each year [1]. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been
health concerns related to alcohol use and misuse. Therefore, the World Health Organization
cautioned that alcohol consumption during the pandemic might have a negative impact such as
risk-taking behaviors, mental health problems and violence [2]. Stress is a risk factor for alcohol
misuse. Policies such as keeping social distance and isolation could cause people stress.
Therefore, it is recommended that governments give warnings about excessive alcohol
consumption during isolation [3].
Actually, since the stay-at-home policy began in some US states, one company has seen a
54% increase in national sales of alcohol per week, compared with 1 year before [4]. Some
studies from the US and UK have reported an increased volume of alcohol consumption in
households [5, 6]. In Japan, a survey from the Japanese government reported that the expenditure
in households for alcohol after April 2020 increased by 40–50% compared with 1 year before [7].
Alcohol misuse also causes physical illness such as liver disorder and pancreatitis,
alcohol-attributable fractions (AAAFs) for all global death, Disability-adjusted life years were
accounted for 48%, 49% in liver cirrhosis and 26%, 28% in pancreatitis, respectively [1].
However, there have been few studies related to alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This study examined the population-level change in cases of alcohol-related liver disease
and pancreatitis that required admission during the COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS
Study design
We conducted a quasi-experimental, interrupted time series analysis using Diagnosis Procedure
Combination (DPC) data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, which
is administered by the Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Kyoto
University. The QIP database consists of DPC data from acute care hospitals voluntarily
participating in the project. The participating hospitals exceed 500, which are located throughout
Japan and contain both public and private hospitals [8].
In Japan, the DPC/pre-diem payment system (PDPS) is a prospective payment system
that is accepted for acute care hospitals. The number of general beds adopted by the DPC/PDPS
in 2018 accounted for 54% of total general beds in Japanese hospitals (482,618/891,872) [9, 10].
The DPC data include insurance claims and clinical summary data, which contains facility
identifiers, admission and discharge statuses (in-hospital death or alive discharge), cause of
admission, primary diagnosis, the most and second -most medical resource-intensive diagnoses,
up to 10 comorbidities and 10 complications. All diagnoses were classified according to the
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. A published paper
described further details [7].
Data collection
We included patients aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized between July 1, 2018 and
June 30, 2020 from the database, and counted the admission cases whose both primary and mostmedical resource-intensive diagnoses were alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis based on
ICD-10 codes (K70.1: Alcoholic hepatitis, K70.2: Alcoholic fibrosis and sclerosis of the liver,

K70.3: Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver, K70.4: Alcoholic hepatic failure, K70.9: Alcoholic liver
disease, unspecified, K85.2: Alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis, K86.0: Alcohol-induced chronic
pancreatitis). We defined K70.1, K70.2, K70.3, K70.4 and K70.7 as alcohol-related liver disease
and K85.2, K86.0 as alcohol-related pancreatitis.

Outcomes of interest
The main outcome was the rate ratio (RR) of hospital admissions with alcohol-related liver
disease or pancreatitis per 1,000 hospital admissions. Secondary outcomes were the RR of
hospital admissions with alcohol-related liver disease, liver cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis and
chronic pancreatitis per 1,000 hospital admissions, respectively. In addition, excess hospital
admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis were calculated.

Statistical analyses
To compare year-on-year, we divided the study population into two: those who were admitted
and discharged from July 2018 to June 2019 and from July 2019 to June 2020. Because the DPC
data were generated on the day of discharge, no data were available for patients who had not
been discharged by the end of June 2020, even if their admission date was before June 30, 2020.
We conducted an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis using segmented and Poisson
regressions by considering seasonality, trends and overdispersion of data, to analyze the
outcomes [11–13]. Seasonality was taken into consideration by adding harmonic terms (sines
and cosines) with 12-month periods to our model [11]. The validity of the Poisson regression
model was evaluated by using the correlograms (functions of autocorrelation and partial

autocorrelation) and the residuals. Excess hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or
pancreatitis was defined as the difference in hospital admissions between the actual number of
hospital admissions and the predicted number of admissions based on our model.
We defined the period from April 2020, when the Japanese government declared a state
of emergency, as the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, and assumed that the COVID-19
outbreak rapidly affected the level of hospitalization after April 2020 [14]. Several studies have
found different alcohol consumptions by age (among younger and older adults) and sex [5, 15].
Therefore, we conducted an exploratory stratified analysis for sex and cases aged below and
above 65 years.
A two-sided P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all analyses were
performed using R 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Ethical considerations
The present study was approved by the ethics committee of Kyoto University (approval number:
R0135), and we did not require informed consent because of the use of anonymized data, in
accordance with the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human
Subjects, as stipulated by the Japanese Government. There were no conflicts of interest in the
manuscript.

RESULTS
Overall hospital admissions were 3,026,389 cases, and 10,242 hospital admissions for alcoholrelated liver disease or pancreatitis occurred in 257 hospitals, which had a total of 67,609 general
beds during the study period.
The characteristics of the study population such as age, sex, length of hospital stay and
in-hospital mortality did not change significantly between the pre-COVID-19 outbreak period
(July 2018 to March 2020) and the COVID-19 outbreak period (April 2020 to June 2020)
(Supplement Table 1). The monthly number of hospital admissions with alcohol-related liver
disease or pancreatitis, a year-on-year comparison and the monthly rates per 1,000 hospital
admissions are shown in Table 1. Figure 1 displays these data together with the predicted
regression curves. We observed an increase in the rate of alcohol-related liver disease and
pancreatitis immediately after the declaration of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic by the
Japanese government.

Model1: Poisson regression model, including trends and seasonality
Predict: Counterfactual scenario (if the outbreak did not occur)

The rate ratio (RR) for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis during the COVID-19
outbreak period (April 2020 to June 2020) compared with the pre-COVID-19 outbreak period
(July 2018 to March 2020) was 1.22 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.12 to 1.33). Under the
counterfactual scenario (if the COVID-19 outbreak did not occur), our model predicted 985.75
(95%CI: 968.38 to 1,003.12) hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis
from April 2020 to June 2020, whereas 1,200 actual hospital admissions occurred during these
three months. Therefore, this indicated that 214.25 (95%CI: 196.88 to 231.62) excess hospital
admissions took place during the COVID-19 outbreak period (Supplement Table 2).

Secondary analyses were performed for each diagnosis (alcohol-related liver disease,
liver cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis). The monthly number of hospital
admissions, year-on-year and the monthly rates per 1,000 hospital admissions are displayed in
Table 2. We display these data together with the predicted regression curves in Figure 2. An
increase in the rate of each disease except for chronic pancreatitis was observed after the
declaration of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic by the Japanese government. Compared
with acute pancreatitis cases, the monthly rates for cases of alcohol-related liver disease and liver
cirrhosis gradually increased after the declaration of emergency. The RR for alcohol-related liver
disease was 1.21 (95%CI: 1.08 to 1.35). The RR for liver cirrhosis was 1.21 (95%CI: 1.06 to
1.38). The RR for acute pancreatitis was 1.28 (95%CI: 1.08 to 1.51). The RR for chronic
pancreatitis was 1.10 (95%CI: 0.84 to 1.44). The results for the impact of the COVID-19
outbreak were summarized in Table 3.
The results of the stratified analysis are shown in Supplement Table 3 and 4. They
suggested hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis in females might
have been more frequent in the COVID-19 outbreak period. Different rates of hospital
admissions were not observed for younger and older adults.

DISCUSSION
In this research, we found that the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with an increase in
hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease and pancreatitis except for chronic
pancreatitis.
The rate of hospital admissions per 1,000 hospital admissions during the COVID-19
outbreak increased by 1.2 times (RR 1.22, 95%CI: 1.12 to 1.33) compared with the prepandemic period for cases of alcoholic liver disease or pancreatitis. The COVID-19 outbreak
caused about 214.25 excess hospital admissions for alcoholic liver disease or pancreatitis based
on predictions from our model.
Strengths and Limitations
The total case volume was a strength of the study. The total number of hospitalizations was
3,026,389 in 257 hospitals throughout Japan. In contrast, the database had no information about
alcohol consumption for each admission case. Therefore, the relationship between individual
alcohol consumption and the occurrence of hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease
or pancreatitis was unclear.
Several studies on alcohol consumption have been published since COVID-19 was first
reported [5, 15, 16, 17]. However, few studies have examined the association between the
pandemic and alcohol-related physical illnesses, such as liver disease and pancreatitis, as of
October 14, 2020, including during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

pandemic. Among more than 800 Hong Kong residents who were exposed to the SARS
pandemic in 2003, 4.7% of males and 14.8% of females who were current drinkers reported an
increase in drinking one year after the SARS pandemic [18]. In addition, the risk of presenting
symptoms of alcohol use disorders three years after the SARS pandemic was about 1.5 times
higher for affected individuals, such as health care workers in Beijing who worked in quarantine
or high-risk wards, compared with unexposed hospital workers [19].
Meaning of the study for clinicians and policymakers
Reports of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic have varied. Several studies
reported that alcohol consumption increased, but other studies reported that alcohol consumption
decreased due to fewer opportunities for eating out or shutdown of retailers [5, 15, 16, 17]. In
Japan, a survey reported that household expenditure for alcohol after April 2020 increased, while
beer companies reported a decrease in sales due to a decrease in sales to the restaurant industry
[20, 21]. Our results also suggest that alcoholic cirrhosis accounted for about half of the increase
in hospital admissions, which might indicate that alcohol consumption increased in certain highrisk groups rather than in the whole of society. News that alcohol consumption among particular
populations such as alcoholics actually increased might support this hypothesis [22–25]. Our
exploratory analysis implied that hospital admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or
pancreatitis in females might have occurred more frequently compared with males. Pollard et al.
reported a significant increase of 0.18 days for heavy drinking (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.32 days) in
women in the US, which represents an increase of 41% from a 2019 baseline of 0.44 days [5].
These results suggest that clinicians and policymakers may need to consider medical and policy
measures for alcohol misuse in high-risk groups.
Unanswered questions and future research

Our study could not reveal a relationship between individual alcohol consumption and hospital
admissions for alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis. Therefore, further research is needed
to confirm the association between alcohol consumption and hospital admissions for alcoholrelated diseases.

Conclusions
The COVID-19 outbreak might have increased the hospitalization rate for alcohol-related liver
disease and pancreatitis due to an increase in alcohol consumption. Based on the results of this
study, clinicians should be aware of the increase in alcohol-related admissions during the
pandemic. Moreover, policymakers should keep in mind that measures such as lock-down for the
pandemic might increase stress and result in hospitalization for alcohol-related liver disease and
pancreatitis.
