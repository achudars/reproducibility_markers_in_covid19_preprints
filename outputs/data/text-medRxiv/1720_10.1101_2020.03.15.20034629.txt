Abstract:
Background:
Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan
city and rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality of novel coronavirus
pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public
health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in
designated hospital is needed.

As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated
one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel
coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of
hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital.
In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine
(PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of
NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we
focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and
management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients.
Results:
1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide
consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with
COVID-19.

：

2. Excellent therapeutic effect Among 101 hospitalized patients with

confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No
secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in
all patients. 3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic
of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key
point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of
second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and
treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract
involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of
chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital.
Conclusions:
In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by
the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is
the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital
emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in
epidemic situation.

COVID-19, high efficient
Introduction:
Since December 2019, COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread
throughout China and worldwide. Up to March 3, 2020, there are 80 174 confirmed
patients and 2915 deaths in 31 provinces in China. Outside of China, there are 8774
confirmed patients and 128 deaths in 64 countries1. In different regions and different
hospitals, there are different management models for respiratory infectious diseases,
so that the treatment effects are different, too2.

At the beginning of this new

epidemic crisis, the missing or insufficient hospital emergency responsive plan caused
rapid spread of COVID-19 and high mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. Which
further results in huge expense to fight the epidemic nationwide subsequently3.
Therefore, some effective hospital management models need to be shared,
summarized and referenced in order to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and
reduce mortality.

Method:
There are 72 public medical and health institutions, including 4 tertiary hospitals in
Zhuhai, a medium-sized city in Guangdong province. As an affiliated hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, my hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment
of COVID-19 patients in Zhuhai. It’s responsible for the consultation and centralized
treatment of patients with COVID-19. Since the first patient was admitted on January
17, my hospital started the emergency plan for infectious diseases. The emergency
responsive mode was still traditional mode: patients were admitted in infectious
department, with help of consultation from PCCM department and instruction from
administrative department in hospital (Fig. 1). But poor treatment effect and low work
efficiency had been assessed after four days, a new decision from president of hospital
was made quickly.
NCP department was established with direct administrative leading and management
by president of hospital, and professional guidance by professor and faculty from
PCCM. The department of infectious diseases was transferred to the periphery in

charge of infection control, multidisciplinary consultation was referred for severe and
critical patients, final treatment strategy was decided by professor of PCCM, and the
whole hospital was mobilized to serve mainly NCP department and fight to
COVID-19 crisis (Fig. 2). Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on
professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert groups we focused on
individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management
strategies in working about COVID-19 patients.

Results:
1. High working efficiency:
By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of
366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these
patients, the age is 45±18.01, 47 cases are male, and 87 cases are from Hubei
province.

At the beginning of the NCP department establishment, 5 treatment areas

(with 80 doctors and 150 nurses) had been set up in 3 days, and each treatment area
can accommodate 17 isolation patients, which ensure all suspected patients in Zhuhai
can be isolated and diagnosed in time. Subsequently, total 10 treatment areas

(with

162 doctors and 322 nurses) were successively established within one week, which
included respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) ( for critical patients), 2 severe
patients treatment area, 3 common patients treatment area, 2 suspected cases
treatment area, one transitional area after nucleic acid removal, and one isolation area
before patients discharge.
2. Excellent therapeutic effect

：

Among 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 23 severe patients had
P/F ratio less than 300mmHg, 9 critical patients had P/F ratio less than 150mmHg,
accompanied by elevated lactate level. Even if higher rate of severe/critical
cases(22.78%), all patients were cured and discharged

（Fig 3）, except for one death,

which had been given invasive mechanical ventilation too early before establishment
of NCP department. The knowledge and understood to COVID-19 is constantly

supplemented and updated. In NCP department, the professor of respiratory
department is directly responsible for the treatment plan, making individualized
treatment according to the specific situation of patients, rather than sticking to the
guidelines, which is the key to the success of the treatment of rest 100 patients. The
effective implementation of the treatment plan benefited from the direct leadership
and instruction from the president of hospital. Moreover, due to the strict assurance of
discharge evidence, the relapse rate of patients after discharge is only 0.97%.
Moreover, no secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore
were found in severe patients

（Fig 3）, because 20 doctors and 33 nurses had worked

in RICU.
3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19
prior to official release conference:
Finding, confirming and reporting person-to-person transmission characteristic of
COVID-19 prior to official release conference in our hospital. And then the local
people's Health Commission and local administrative departments in Zhuhai were
promptly informed, and a timely response plan and stronger protection were set up.
The family and close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients were isolated quickly
and timely, so that the second generation infectious patients (local residents in Zhuhai)
was 16, occupying only 15.53% of all patients. Meanwhile, strengthened protection

is also key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty Fig 3 . In
NCP department, 300 sets of protective N95 masker and protective suits pro day had
been used. And total 1500 protective sets and 9 sets of positive pressure electric air
supply respirator had been consumed in RICU.
4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update:
The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found in our
hospital4, which improved discharge process of COVID-19 patients. And the earliest
clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 had been carried out in our
hospital, which was helpful for including of chloroquine in updated guideline.

Discussion:
In the face of some public health crisis, there is different emergency system in
different country. For example

，the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System

(HEICS) has emerged as a popular incident command system model for hospital
emergency response in the United States and other some countries. Since the
inception of the HEICS in 1991, several events have transformed the requirements of
hospital emergency management, including the 1995 Tokyo Subway sarin attack, and
the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in eastern Asia and
Toronto, Canada. But HEICS should be continuous improved as additional challenges
arise and as hospitals gain further experience with its use5. However, in China, due to
different political system and other problems, most hospitals still lack the emergency
management system similar to HEICS, even if there are some disadvantages in
HEICS. In the past 20 years, the major respiratory infectious diseases in China are
SARS outbreaks in 2003, H1N1 crisis in 2009, and small-scale prevalent of H7N9 in
2013. In terms of epidemic and transmission scale, this crisis of COVID-19 is close to
SARS, so lessons learned from the SARS epidemic should be especially important in
responding to the current emergency6. In fact, the significant gap in the detection
capacity of new infectious diseases and emergency incident responsive system had
been found in China7. Unfortunately, these gaps are only recognized, but not paid
more attention and improved in time, which has become a potential crisis.
There is permanent resident population of about 1.8911 million, but the proportion of
floating population is higher and the COVID-19 protection and control task is hard in
Zhuhai. Our hospital, the fifth affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, is the only
designated hospitals in Zhuhai. There are advantages and disadvantages to set up
designated hospital for management and treatment COVID-19 patients in a
comprehensive tertiary hospital. Compared with special infectious disease hospital,
comprehensive tertiary hospital has powerful PCCM department, multidisciplinary
consultation, and can mobilize more resources. For example, Extracorporeal
Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) was operated by group with the rich experience and

thoracic closed drainage and tracheotomy were completed by surgical department
successfully in the first patient. On the contrary, too much administrative departments
and related clinical departments were involved, resulting in poor implementation in
treatment and management, based on traditional hospital responsive mode.
But, our hospital could assess epidemic situation and regulate hospital strategy
quickly, establish NCP department with direct leading and management by president
of hospital, professional guidance by professor and faculty from PCCM. The infection
department was transferred to the periphery in charge of infection control instead of
NCP treatment. Depended on rich experience of respiratory specialist on treatment of
viral pneumonia, COVID-19 patients had been treated well, particularly for 22 severe
and critical patients. Within one month, six versions of the guideline for NCP have
been published. Rather than sticking to the guidelines, the opinions from respiratory
professor and the expert group had been thorough implemented dependent on
individualized treatment, under the direct authorization of the president. Therefore,
after the adjustment of the main treatment group and strategy, the overall treatment
effect significantly improved, all patients were successfully cured and discharged.
Meanwhile, zero infection in medical faculty was due to early finding of
person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 and enough supply of
protective equipment and materials from hospital and government financial support.
In addition, in NCP department, under the direct leadership of the president, the
scientific research team responded quickly to the problems found in clinical practice.
The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 was found by
gastroscopy and colonoscopy in our hospital, which improved discharge process of
COVID-19 patients. And the earliest application of chloroquine as anti-viral drug dues
to direct instruction of president of hospital.
In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by
the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is
the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital
emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in
epidemic situation.
