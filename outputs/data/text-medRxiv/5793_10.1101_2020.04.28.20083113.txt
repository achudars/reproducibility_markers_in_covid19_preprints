ABSTRACT
Aim: The aim of this study was to uncover whether kidney diseases were involved in
COVID-19 pandemic from a systematic review.
Methods: The studies reported the kidney outcomes in different severity of
COVID-19 were included in this study. Standardized mean differences or odds ratios
were calculated by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software.
Results: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395
COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that the comorbidity of chronic
kidney disease (CKD) (OR = 3.28), complication of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR =
11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86),
blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53),
received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) was
significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the
complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were
remarkably elevated in critical group than that in severe group.
Conclusion: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19.
CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere
COVID-19 patients. The risk of AKI is higher in critical group than that in severe
group.

Systematic review

1. Introduction
In December, 2019, 41 hospitalized patients had been identified as having
laboratory-confirmed 2019-novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV)-related infection in
Wuhan, Hubei, China[1]. The 2019-nCoV was discovered by whole-genome

sequencing, direct PCR, and culture[2]. The next-generation sequencing of 2019- nCoV
confirmed that it is sufficiently divergent from severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS)-CoV and

considered as a novel human- infecting betacoronavirus[3].

Moreover, structural analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV might bind to the angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans[3]. The 2019-nCoV causing the
current outbreak of coronavirus disease has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the
International Committee Taxonomy of Viruses. On 30 January 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared the 2019- nCoV outbreak
(https://www.who.int). On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) to be a global pandemic (https://www.who.int).

The

SARS-CoV-2 promptly spread across China and around the world. As of April 14,
2020, a total of more than 1,848,000 laboratory-confirmed cases had been
documented worldwide. The most common clinical characteristics were fever (43.8%
on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%)[4]. The single-cell
RNA sequencing datasets indicated that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung type II
alveolar cells, colon colonocytes, ileum ECs, and proximal tubule cells[5,6]. In addition,
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in urine, blood, anal swab, and oropharyngeal swab from
nine patients with COVID-19 who were retested by qRT-PCR[7]. The above evidence
revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can affect respiratory system, digestive system,
hematological system, and urinary system which were associated with the clinical
features of COVID-19. Moreover, the single-cell transcriptome analysis identified that
ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) genes are relatively high
coexpression in podocytes and proximal tubule cells[8].
A prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 showed that the
prevalence of increased serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and estimated
glomerular ﬁltration (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%,
respectively[9]. Meanwhile, acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 5.1% COVID-19
patients[9]. A meta-analysis including 1389 COVID-19 patients indicated that chronic
kidney disease (CKD) was consistent with severe COVID-19[10]. Meanwhile, the
China professionals point out that AKI cannot be ignored in the diagnosis and

treatment of COVID-19[11]. However, the study including 116 COVID-19-confirmed
patients demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in AKI, or aggravate
CKD in the COVID-19 patients[12]. Therefore, it is stringent to perform a systematic
review to verify whether the kidney diseases are involved in COVID-19.

Materials and methods

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
statement was employed to design and report the study[13].
2.1. Search Strategy. The following English databases were retrieved to confirm trials:
PubMed and medRxiv.gov. In addition, the Chinese databases, such as the CNKI
Database and WanFang Database were searched. All of the databases were searched
from their available dates of inception to the latest issue (April 13, 2020).
Different search strategies were integrated as follows. For the English databases,
free text terms were employed, such as “SARS-CoV-2” or “2019-nCoV” or
“COVID-19” or “novel coronavirus pneumonia” and “kidney” or “renal”. For the
Chinese databases, free text terms were applied for “xin xing guan zhuang bing du”
(which means SARS-CoV-2 in Chinese) or “xin xing guan Zhuang bing du fei yan”
(which means COVID-19 in Chinese). The reference lists of relevant publications
were also searched to identify extra studies.
2.2. Selection Criteria.
Inclusion criteria: (1) study type: case series study, cohort study, or prospective study
which reported the connection between kidney involvement and COVID-19
irrespective of publication status or language; (2) subjects: adult patients diagnosed
with COVID-19; (3) outcomes: COVID-19 patients with CKD comorbidity, AKI,
serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, or received continuous renal replacement
therapy (CRRT).
The case reports, reviews, meta-analysis, or studies regarding renal replacement
therapy regularly were excluded. For repeat studies whose preprints were published in
medRxiv.gov, the final version studies were included. The literatures were selected by
two reviewers (YF Liu and Z Zhang) independently. The flowchart of the study

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083113; this version posted May 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

selection has been drafted in accordance to the PRISMA principle.
2.3. Data Extraction and Management. The data were extracted by two independent
reviewers (XL Pan and GL Xing), and contradictions were resolved by consensus or
were judged by another author. The data presented as median and interquartile range
was transformed into mean and standard deviation according to the formula below
(http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~tongt/papers/median2mean.html).
The studies’ quality was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale
(NOS) which assess the quality of nonrandomised studies in meta-analyses[14]. The
quality of the included studies was estimated independently by two investigators (SH
Tu and Y Zhang). The NOS scores ≥ 6 were considered high quality studies. The
authors were connected to clarify vagueness or absence of the data, and related data
were extracted by consensus if the authors were unavailable.
2.4. Data Synthesis and Analysis. The Review Manager meta-analysis software,
version 5.3 was applied to analyze the indicators. The standardized mean differences
(SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous data. The
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for dichotomous data. Heterogeneity
was estimated through the chi-square test and Higgins I2 test. A fixed-effect model
was applied if the studies were sufficiently alike (P > 0.10); otherwise, a
random-effects model was employed. A Z score was calculated to detect the overall
effect, with significance set at P < 0.05. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot
if the number of included studies > 10.
Two subgroup analyses were performed to diminish the clinical heterogeneity
according to the disease severity: severe and nonsevere groups, critical and severe
groups.

Results

3.1. Study Selection. The process of study selection was showed in Fig. 1. After
filtering, COVID-19 patients were divided into severe and nonsevere groups in 28
studies[1,4,15-40]. In 8 studies, the COVID-19 patients were classified as more than two
groups according to the disease severity which included severe and critical

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083113; this version posted May 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19 patients[41-48]. Finally, 36 studies were included in the study. The
characteristics of the studies were indicated in Table 1. Together, 6395 COVID-19
patients were included in the study.
3.2. Study Descriptions. All the included studies were performed in China. Five
studies were published in Chinese[30-32,47,48], and the others were published in English.
Eight studies were conducted as multi- center trials[4,15,19,23-25,29,45]. The patients with
COVID-19 divided into ICU care and no ICU care in four studies were included in
the severe and nonsevere groups[1,36,37,39]. The COVID-19 patients divided into ARDS
(acute respiratory distress syndrome) and non-ARDS in one study were also included
in the severe and nonsevere groups[38]. Two studies combined the data of severe and
critical patients together, and they were also included in subgroup severe and
nonsevere groups[30,31].
3.3. Quality of the Included Studies. As indicated in Table 1, the majority of included
studies were poor quality except four studies whose NOS scores are 6[1,16,31,43]. The
NOS scores of other 31 trials are 5, and only one trial’s NOS scores were 4.
3.4. Publication Bias. As the included studies of three outcomes > 10 in severe and
nonsevere groups, the funnel plots were conducted to estimate the publication bias
(Fig. 2). The funnel plot of CKD was symmetrical, suggesting that there was no
publication bias. However, the funnel plot of blood urea nitrogen was a little
asymmetrical, implying that the publication bias existed to some extent.
3.5. Effects of Outcomes
3.5.1. Severe and nonsevere groups
3.5.1.1 The outcome of comorbidity of CKD. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the number of
participants ranged from 21 to 1099. There was no statistical heterogeneity between
the studies (P = 0.72). Thirteen studies mentioned comorbidity of CKD (including
3325 subjects), and pooled results indicated that comorbidity of CKD was
significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group (P < 0.00001, OR
= 3.28, 95% CI: 2.0 to 5.37).
3.5.1.2. The outcome of complication of AKI. As showed in Fig. 3, the number of
participants ranged from 41 to 1099. There was no statistical heterogeneity between

the studies (P = 0.12). Eight studies reported complication of AKI (involving 2072
subjects), and complication of AKI was significantly elevated in severe group than
that in nonsevere group (P < 0.00001, OR = 11.02, 95% CI: 6.54 to 18.57).
3.5.1.3. The outcome of serum creatinine. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the number of
participants ranged from 21 to 564. There was statistical heterogeneity between the
studies (P < 0.00001). Twenty-two studies measured serum creatinine (including 3261
subjects), and pooled results showed that serum creatinine was remarkably increased
in severe group than that in nonsevere group (P = 0.0005, SMD = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.3
to 1.06).
3.5.1.4. The outcome of abnormal serum creatinine. As indicated in Fig. 3, the number
of participants ranged from 77 to 752. There was no statistical heterogeneity between
the studies (P = 0.51). Seven studies documented abnormal serum creatinine
(including 1775 subjects), and severe group had a higher ratio of abnormal serum
creatinine than nonsevere group (P < 0.00001, OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 2.71 to 8.7).
3.5.1.5. The outcome of blood urea nitrogen. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the number of
participants ranged from 21 to 564. There was statistical heterogeneity between the
studies (P < 0.00001). Seventeen studies assayed blood urea nitrogen (including 2814
subjects), and pooled results revealed that blood urea nitrogen was significantly
elevated in severe group than that in nonsevere group (P < 0.00001, SMD = 1.95, 95%
CI: 1.23 to 2.66).
3.5.1.6. The outcome of abnormal blood urea nitrogen. As showed in Fig. 3, the
number of participants ranged from 122 to 193. There was no statistical heterogeneity
between the studies (P = 0.67). Four studies documented abnormal blood urea
nitrogen (involving 683 subjects), and severe group had a higher ratio of abnormal
blood urea nitrogen than nonsevere group (P < 0.00001, OR = 6.53, 95% CI: 3.42 to
12.46).
3.5.1.7. The outcome of receiving CRRT. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the number of
participants ranged from 41 to 1099. There was no statistical heterogeneity between
the studies (P = 0.84). Six studies reported receiving CRRT (including 1827 subjects),
and severe group had higher ratio of receiving CRRT than nonsevere group (P <

0.00001, OR = 23.63, 95% CI: 8.34 to 66.95).
3.5.2. Critical and Severe groups
3.5.2.1 The outcome of comorbidity of CKD. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the number of
participants ranged from 50 to 166. There was no statistical heterogeneity between the
studies (P = 0.88). Three studies reported comorbidity of CKD (including 346
subjects), and pooled results indicated that there was no significant difference
between the two groups (P = 0.77, OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 0.23 to 7.16).
3.5.2.2. The outcome of complication of AKI. As indicated in Fig. 4, the number of
participants ranged from 50 to 172. There was no statistical heterogeneity between the
studies (P = 0.37). Three studies documented complication of AKI (involving 354
subjects), and the complication of AKI was significantly elevated in critical group
than that in severe group (P < 0.00001, OR = 13.92, 95% CI: 4.69 to 41.26).
3.5.2.3. The outcome of serum creatinine. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the number of
participants ranged from 27 to 132. There was statistical heterogeneity between the
studies (P < 0.00001). Seven studies determined serum creatinine (including 480
subjects), and pooled results indicated that there was no significant difference
between the two groups (P = 0.13, SMD = 0.43, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.99).
3.5.2.4. The outcome of blood urea nitrogen. As showed in Fig. 4, the number of
participants ranged from 27 to 132. There was statistical heterogeneity between the
studies (P < 0.00001). Five studies measured blood urea nitrogen (including 379
subjects), and pooled results showed that blood urea nitrogen is strikingly increased in
critical group than that in severe group (P = 0.002, SMD = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.44 to
1.91).
Only one study reported abnormal blood urea nitrogen and abnormal serum
creatinine, so the result was not pooled. CRRT was not documented in this subgroup.

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first research which comprehensively illustrates the
kidney involvement in COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review observed that
the CKD and AKI were involved in the COVID-19. Compared with nonsevere group,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083113; this version posted May 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the comorbidity of CKD (OR = 3.28) and complication of AKI (OR = 11.02) were
significantly elevated in severe group. Meanwhile, AKI occurred in 4.3% COVID-19
patients, and 21.1% were severe COVID-19 patients. The complication of AKI is
lower than 5.1% which was reported in a previous cohort study, of which 42.7% were
severely ill[9]. The different disease severity and sample size may contribute to the
difference. The comorbidity of CKD is similar to previous meta-analysis (including
1389 participants) which showed that CKD was significantly associated with severe
COVID-19 (OR = 3.03), among which 19.7% were defined as severe COVID-19[10].
Furthermore, the serum creatinine, ratio of abnormal serum creatinine, blood
urea nitrogen, ratio of abnormal blood urea nitrogen were remarkably elevated in
severe group than that in nonsevere group, with SMD = 0.68, OR = 4.86, SMD = 1.95,
OR = 6.53, respectively. The OR regarding abnormal serum creatinine and abnormal
blood urea nitrogen were lower than that in the severe and nonsevere groups with
regard to AKI. The AKI also occurred in normal serum creatinine and blood urea
nitrogen, which could lead to the higher OR of AKI.
The CRRT is recommended in severe or critical patients because it reduces
cytokine damage, removes endotoxin, and improves cardiac function and kidney
function[49]. Hence, the severe group had higher ratio of receiving CRRT than
nonsevere group (OR = 23.63).
The critical group had a higher ratio of AKI than that in severe group (OR =
13.92) which is higher than subgroup severe and nonsevere groups (OR = 11.02).
Furthermore, the blood urea nitrogen was increased in critical group than that in
severe group (SMD = 1.18). However, there is no significant difference between the
two groups with regard to comorbidity of CKD. Owing to immunodepression of CKD,
cytokine storm is weakened and CKD patients are not vulnerable to critical
COVID-19, which could explain the result. Meanwhile, there was no significant
increase in serum creatinine in critical group. We speculated that the CRRT was
frequently applied in critical group, so the serum creatinine was not notably elevated
in critical group. In addition, AKI is diagnosed not only by abnormal serum creatinine
but also the change of serum creatinine and urine volume.

There are lots of reasons which give rise to the kidney impairment in COVID-19.
First, SARS-CoV-2 viral load induce cytotoxicity of renal resident cells. The
endothelial cell swelling, renal tubular epithelial cell swelling, vacuolar degeneration,
and drop were observed with light microscope of renal biopsy in three COVID-19
cases[50]. Second, the fever, vomit, diarrhea, and shock are likely to cause kidney
hypoperfusion. Third, Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly
associated with cytokine storm[43]. cytokine storm participated in SARS-CoV-2
infection[51]. A renal transplanted patient with COVID-19 showed a mild disease
because immunosuppression of renal transplantation can "be protective"[52]. Fourth,
the nephrotoxicity of some drugs, such as non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs,
antivirals, antibiotics, and antifungal could lead to kidney damage. Fifth, organ
crosstalk such as cardiorenal syndrome, hypoxia, and rhabdomyolysis also could
cause kidney impairment[49]. Sixth, mechanical ventilation is able to result in AKI[53].
Seventh, the elderly patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes,
chronic cardiology disease, or chronic liver disease are susceptible to trigger
secondary kidney diseases which may not be confirmed before admission.
Several limitations of the included studies should be concerned. First, all the
included studies did not stage CKD. Different CKD stage could have different risks
for COVID-19 and have different prognosis. Second, only one study[9] reported the
AKI stage which reflects the AKI severity, progression, and prognosis. AKI occurred
primarily or AKI on CKD is unknown for the included studies. Third, all the included
studies did not qualify the 24h total urine protein. Therefore, it is difficult to judge the
severity of potential kidney diseases. Fourth, all the included studies did not measure
the 24h urine volume or the change of urine volume which is beneficial for the
diagnosis of AKI. Only two studies reported the urine routine[15,39]. Finally, the
outcomes of AKI were unclear.
Several limitations of this study should be noticed. First, all the included trials
were conducted in Chinese populations, which inferred a high risk of selection bias.
Second, most of the studies were of poor quality except four studies. Third, the
heterogeneity was significant in terms of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.

The different disease severity, different sample size, different detection methods, and
reference range were responsible for the heterogeneity. Fourth, the children or
teenagers COVID-19 patients were probably included in this study because the
included studies did not clearly restrict to adult COVID-19 patients. Fifth, the quality
of the most of included studies was low which may weaken the evidence level. Finally,
the most important criteria eGFR was reported in only three studies[30,37,47]. In view of
this, we should carefully interpret all of the conclusions due to the considerable poor
quality and clinical variety of the studies.
A series of recommendations are given: first, detailed kidney-specific
examinations are necessary for the COVID-19 patients with proteinuria or AKI, such
as urine routine, 24h total urine protein, urine Bence-Jones protein, immunoglobulins,
complements, antinuclear antibody, anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibodies,
antineutrophil

cytoplasmic

antibodies,

anti- glomerular

basement

membrane

antibodies, anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies, estimated glomerular ﬁltration,
ultrasound of urinary system. Second, recent studies focused on the tubular epithelial
cell injury, renal biopsy and renal pathology including light microscope, electron
microscope, and immunofluorescence are essential to determine whether other kidney
resident cells are involved in COVID-19. Third, the patients with proteinuria or AKI
are needed to follow-up.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that CKD and AKI are involved in
severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 is susceptible to occur in CKD patients than
nonsevere COVID-19. With the severity of COVID-19 increasing, the risk of AKI
elevated strikingly. CRRT is applied more frequently in severe group than that in
nonsevere group. Clinicians should be cautious of kidney diseases in patients with
COVID-19, especially the severe and critical COVID-19. More attention should be
paid to monitoring kidney function to avoid end stage renal disease and decease in
COVID-19 pandemic.
