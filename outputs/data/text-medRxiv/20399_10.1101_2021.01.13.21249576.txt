Abstract
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2, which began as an outbreak in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly
throughout the globe. Although the majority of infections are mild, severe and critical
COVID-19 patients face deterioration of respiratory function, and may also present
extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart and
nervous system. Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic
material by RT-PCR in urine samples obtained from critical care COVID-19 patients. In
51 patients included, we found higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay and
a more frequent dialysis need in urine-positive patients. These findings could suggest

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2, which began as an outbreak in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly
throughout the globe. Although the majority of infections are mild, severe and critical
COVID-19 patients face deterioration of respiratory function, and may also present
extrapulmonary manifestations, mostly affecting the kidney, digestive tract, heart and
nervous system1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the important complications of
the COVID-19, with an overall incidence of 4.5%, but affecting up to 36% of patients
with severe disease2. AKI is considered a marker of disease severity and a negative
prognostic factor for survival3.
Extrapulmonary manifestations may be explained by direct infection of cells in target
organs, as the kidney, since viral dissemination may occur through the bloodstream,
leading to invasion of the organ and injury to the resident renal cells4. Other plausible
mechanisms are inflammation-driven, since such patients face cytokine storms, with
systemic inflammation-mediated injury, and are frequently dehydrated and exposed to
secondary infections in the intensive care unit5. The direct viral cytopathic effect
hypothesis is supported by previous reports of detection of viral genetic material in the
blood and urine samples obtained from COVID-19 patients6, as well as by evidence
from post-mortem studies that showed the presence of viral particles in the renal tissue7.

Also, renal abnormalities as hematuria and proteinuria are commonly reported, and
associated with higher mortality8. However, the clinical relevance of the coronavirusinduced cytopathic effect in the AKI of COVID-19 remains unclear.
Here, we prospectively evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material by RTPCR in urine samples obtained from COVID-19 patients admitted in the intensive care
units in Hospital São Rafael in Salvador, Brazil. We intended to investigate a possible
association between positive results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in urine samples and
AKI onset, and abnormalities in urine sediments. Our hypothesis was that the virus
would be detected more frequently in patients that develop AKI, supporting the role for
a direct cytopathic effect in the renal parenchymal as the underlying mechanism of AKI
in COVID-19 patients.

Methods
Ethics statement
The study was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and
received prior approval by the Ethics Committee of São Rafael Hospital in Salvador,
Brazil (CAAE 34428920.0.0000.0048). All participants gave informed consent.
Subject selection
All adult patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen
supplementation admitted to the intensive care unit of São Rafael Hospital between July
10th and September 16th 2020 were screened for eligibility. Patients were included in
the study if they received the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by
nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT scan. Fifty-one subjects were included in the

study and urine samples were collected in forty-nine patients. AKI was diagnosed by
KDIGO criteria.
Isolation of viral RNA by RT-PCR
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab samples using a
quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Urine samples were stored at -80°C before nucleic acid
extraction and real-time RT-PCR. Urine nucleic acid extraction was performed using
NucleoSpin RNA for RNA purification with an elution volume of 50 µL (MachereyNagel, Düren, Germany). Real-time RT-PCR was performed
using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) that detects the
following targets: RdRP gene and N gene specific for SARS-CoV-2, and E gene for all
of Sarbecovirus, in a single tube. Cycle thresholds below 40.0 were considered positive
by the 7500 real-time PCR System (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Data analysis
Categorical variables were compared using fisher exact test. Continuous data were
presented as median and interquartile range; the Mann-Whitney U test was used for
comparisons. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Data was analyzed with the
PSPP® statistical package.
Results
Prospective follow up of the participants revealed an AKI incidence of 50.9%. AKI
onset occurred during the first days of admission in the ICU or at the study enrollment
in most of them. RT-PCR analysis of urine samples revealed a positive result in six
patients (12.2%) and no correlation was found between AKI and viral RNA detection in
the urine by RT-PCR. Clinical and laboratorial data are shown in table 1. We found a

statistically significant difference by comparing the frequency of comorbidities hypertension and diabetes mellitus - in the group with positive RT-PCR result in urine
samples compared to the group with negative results. Patients with positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR results in urine samples also presented significantly higher creatinine
levels at admission and presented the highest creatinine values during hospital stay
(Table 1). Proteinuria was found to be more common in these patients (66.6% vs
46.6%), as well as the incidence of AKI (66.6% vs 48.9%). A second urine sample was
collected in three patients, and was negative in all of them. Patients presenting positive
RT-PCR result in urine samples also presented a longer hospital stay.

Discussion
In this prospective cohort, we found that a positive RT-PCR in the urine was an
infrequent finding. These patients were all male, had higher prevalence of diabetes and
high blood pressure, that are well known risk factors for severe disease. They also had
more urine proteinuria, higher serum creatinine levels and a higher prevalence of AKI,
in accordance to previous reports2. Taken together, these findings may suggest a
possible cytopathic viral effect influencing the severity of renal disease.
Also, the duration of symptoms was shorter in the group with detected SARSCoV-2 in urine samples. To the best of our knowledge, another study reported a lower
detection of the viral RNA in the urine, but the median days of symptoms before
collection was fourteen days9. So, we speculate that viremia, as well as renal cells
infection and associated viral shedding in the urine could be an early event.
In addition, our findings also point to multifactorial causes already described in
the IRA related to COVID-19, such as exposure to nephrotoxins, volemic state,

systemic inflammation and endothelial lesions (microthrombi formation)10. This
hypothesis could explain the relatively low prevalence of proteinuria in the urine
negative patients. Also, only one third of all patients presented hematuria; this finding,
also, does not support a relevant role for direct viral-mediated cytopathic effects the
pathophysiology of AKI in a high proportion of COVID-19 patients.
Our study has some limitations. It was a single center, observational study with a
limited number of participants. We also did not successfully obtain follow-up urine
specimens, as the majority of AKI patients already had AKI upon enrollment in the
study.
In summary, we searched prospectively the urine of COVID-19 patients for the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and found a relatively low incidence of this finding, which does
not support a relevant role for cytopathic viral effects in the majority of AKI patients.
However, the subgroup of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in urine
samples presented a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertension. In this subgroup,
the association of higher serum creatinine levels, a longer hospital stay and a more
frequent dialysis need were found. These findings, although preliminary, lead to the
speculation that, in predisposed patients, a direct viral cytopathic effect could contribute
to a more severe phenotype.
