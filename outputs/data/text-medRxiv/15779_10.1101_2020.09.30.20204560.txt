Abstract: We aimed to assess the

reported rate of flu vaccination in the season 2019/2020 in

respondents to the Italian nationwide online EPICOVID 19 survey. A national convenience sample
of volunteers aged 18 or older was assessed between 13th April and 2nd June 2020. Flu vaccine rates
were calculated for all classes of age. The association between the independent variables and the flu
vaccine was assessed by applying a multivariable binary logistic regression model. Of the 198,822
respondents 41,818 (21.0%) reported to have received a flu vaccination shot during the last
influenza season. In particular, 15,009 (53.4%) subjects aged 65 years or older received a flu
vaccination shot. Being 65 years aged or older (aOR 3.06, 95%CI 2.92-3.20) and having a high
education level (aOR 1.34. 95%CI 1.28-1.41) were independently associated to flu vaccination. Heart
and lung diseases were the morbidities associated with the higher odds of being vaccinated [aOR
1.97 (95%CI 1.86-2.09) and aOR 1.92 (95%CI 1.84-2.01), respectively]. Nursing home residents aged
≥ 65 years showed a lower odds of being vaccinated [aOR 0.39 (95%CI 0.28-0.54)]. Our data claims
for an urgent public heath effort to fill the gap of missed vaccination opportunities reported in the
past flu seasons.

1. Introduction
Influenza is an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract, whose clinical manifestations range from
mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to life treating complications requiring hospitalization. It is
estimated that every year flu can cause worldwide high morbidity and mortality epidemics with
approximately 3 to 5 million cases and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths [1]. In the northern
hemisphere Influenza viruses circulating during fall and winter seasons cause epidemic outbreaks
with an important burden of morbidity and a remarkable mortality rate. In Italy, the cost for the
national health care system has been estimated an average of 1.4 US$ billion for each season between
1999 and 2008 [2].
The new pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
rapidly spread starting from China in late December 2019 and abruptly involving the north of Italy
in late February 2020 [3]. SARS-CoV-2 infection is able to cause a severe respiratory syndrome with
the requirement of intensive care assistance and eventually leading to death in a significant
percentage of hospitalized patients [4, 5]. The dramatic impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the
Italian national healthcare system lead the national authorities to impose a national lock-down from
March 9 to May 18, 2020. After a period of apparent control in summer months, current Italian
epidemiological situation is evolving with a slight daily increment of the number of cases and a
progressive

increment

of

hospitalized

patients

[6].

Consequently,

non-pharmacological

interventions, such as the face mask combined with social distancing, are still enforced.
The new challenge in the management of the pandemic will

appear in the 2020/2021 flu season,

when the co-occurrence of influenza and flu-like illnesses may overcome the diagnostic capacity of
our system with regard to the capability for molecularly testing all subjects with respiratory
symptoms. Moreover, the clinical impact of subsequent or concomitant influenza and SARS-CoV-2
infections is still unknown, especially in the elderly populations and in patients with comorbidities.
To date, no effective treatment has been demonstrated to radically change the natural history of
SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] and several vaccination strategies are still under development [8]; on the
other hand, flu vaccination is able to decrease both the incidence rates of influenza and to moderate
the severity of the disease in case of infection. Moreover, a remarkable decrease in morbidity for
pneumonia, respiratory and cardiovascular complications and consequent risk of hospitalization
and death has been consistently reported in the literature [9-12]. The reduced risk of hospitalization
is particularly important considering the significant amount of hospital resources that are required
for the management of COVID 19 patients which required hospitalization and intensive care
assistance in a not negligible percentage [4, 5]. In the end, influenza vaccinations are not only safe,
with few adverse events related to its administration, but also proven to be effective in children
above 6 months of age, people with comorbid conditions and also in the elderly population [9, 10,
13].
Despite national and international recommendations for routine flu vaccination, vaccine uptake in
Italy remains low in the general population, as well as in the high risk groups.

Our aim was to

assess the reported rate of flu vaccination in the season 2019/2020 in respondents to the nationwide
online EPICOVID 19 survey [14] and to identify factors associated with the uptake of flu vaccination,
in order to address potential gaps to be filled in the public health system.

The study design was described elsewhere [14, 15] and the study was registered (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT04471701). In brief, EPICOVID19 is an Italian cross-sectional, web-based survey that was
initiated in April 2020. A national convenience sample of volunteers aged 18 or older with access to
internet and able to give an informed consent was assessed. The participants were recruited via
social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp), press releases, internet pages, local radio,
TV stations, and institutional websites; the European Commission's open-source official EUSurvey
management tool was used to collect the data (https://epicovid19.itb.cnr.it/). The geographical
coverage [14] such as the representativeness of the survey according to the Italian official
demographic data [15] were described elsewhere.

and 2nd June 2020. The socio-demographic information included sex (male vs female, furtherly
classified as pregnant or not), age (18-24, 25-29 up to 90+ and further categorized as <65 or ≥ 65 years
of age), educational level (primary school or less = Low, middle or high school = Medium, and
university degree or post-graduate = High), and occupational status (unemployed, employed,
retired, student, and other). Work categories included in the national guidelines for flu vaccine were
generated (Health professionals, armed forces, agricultural, forestry and fisher workers). Two ad
hoc dummy variables were also created for categorizing residents in nursing homes (yes or not) and
for respondents living with an “at risk cohabitant” according to the 2017-2019 Italian national
vaccination plan (yes or not) [16].

Chronic conditions reported were lung diseases, heart diseases,

metabolic disorders, renal diseases, oncological diseases, diseases of the immune system, liver
diseases and pre-planned major surgical procedures. A new variable was created by summing the
chronic conditions referred by participants (categorised as none, 1, 2 or ≥3 co-morbidities).
Information about autonomy in carrying out daily activities, self-rated health (very bad, bad,
adequate, good or very good) was also available. The participants were also asked if they had
received an influenza vaccination during the previous autumn/winter season.

Out of the 207,341 respondents, the study population consisted of 198,822 participants who provided
informed consent, and for whom the data were fully available for the analysis. For the aim of this
study, participants were categorized as vaccinated or not vaccinated for flu during the 2019/2020
season.

2.4 Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were performed to show the numerical distributions, overall and by flu vaccine
status, of all the variables that at a later stage were included as independent in the models applied
for statistical inference. Continuous variables were expressed as mean [Standard Deviation (SD)]
whereas categorical and ordinal ones as count and percentages. Flu vaccine rates were calculated for
all classes of age and for all Italian regions, in this latter case also stratifying by sex (male vs female)
and age (<65 vs ≥65 years). The association between the independent variables and the flu vaccine
(0=not reported, 1=reported) was assessed by applying a multivariable binary logistic regression
model. Adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR), together with their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), were
estimated for each independent variable, with p-level of statistical significance set at .05, two tails.
The same regression model was used when restricting the population analysed to older people (≥65
years). All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp) and STATA
version 15.0 (StataCorp LP).

official national data and in the EPICOVID19 respondents.
More than half of the respondents (59.4%) had high educational level, whereas 34.6% and 6%
reported medium and high educational level. More than seventy-five percent of respondents
(149,168; 75%) reported no diseases, whereas the remaining 25% reported at least one clinical
condition representing

per se a flu vaccine indication. Vaccination coverage progressively increased

up to 50.0% in those reporting 3 or more comorbidities. Among participants reporting at least one
condition, those with heart disease showed the higher vaccination coverage (52.5%) followed by
those reporting oncological diseases (40%) and metabolic disorders (39%); whereas only 34.6% of
those with lung diseases reported to be vaccinated for influenza. Among the professions with an
indication for flu vaccination, health care workers were those with the higher coverage (35.7%).
Vaccination coverage ranged widely across Italian regions, from 18.2% in Abruzzo to 23.7% in
Friuli-Venezia Giulia in the overall respondents (Figure 1A) and from 48.7% in Piemonte to 63.6%
Friuli-Venezia Giulia in those aged ≥ 65 years (Figure 1B).

Among comorbidities, heart and lung diseases were conditions associated with higher odds of being
vaccinated, both in subjects aged 18-64 [aOR 2.15 (1.98 to 2.33) and aOR 1.95 (1.85 to 2.05),
respectively] and in those aged above 65 years [aOR 1.54 (95%CI 1.42-1.67) and aOR 1.91 (95%CI
1.73-2.12), respectively]. The odds of being vaccinated progressively increased with the number of
reported morbidities, with a more pronounced effect in those aged below 65 years (Supplementary

4. Discussion
The EPICOVID 19 web based survey, which aimed to highlight different epidemiological and
clinical aspects of COVID-19 epidemic in the first wave of the Italian epidemic, allowed the
assessment of flu vaccination coverage in the 2019/2020 flu season in a large unselected sample of
respondents. Moreover, we were able to identify predictors of flu vaccine uptake and highlight
significant gaps in vaccination coverage in key populations such as in those residing

in nursing

homes and in those reporting specific medical conditions (i.e. liver diseases, kidney diseases and
diseases of the immune system).
Our findings showed an overall vaccination rate of 21% and a rate of 53.4% in those aged 65 years or
older, clearly below the target recommended coverage. The available National data obtained from a
surveillance system collecting data from the general practitioners since 1990/2000 flu season, report a
progressive increase in the vaccination coverage until 2009/2010 for the overall population (19.6 per
100 inhabitants) and until 2008/2009 for those aged 65 years or older (66.3 per 100 inhabitants). A
progressive decline was subsequently observed for those aged 65 years or older until 2014/2015 (48.5
per 100 inhabitants) followed by a slight progressive increase in the subsequent years [17].
According to the official data of the Italian Ministry of Health of vaccination coverage in 2019/2020
flu season the overall vaccination coverage in the whole Italian population was 16.7 over 100
inhabitants and 54.6 over 100 inhabitants in those aged 65 years or older confirming the trend

toward an increasing vaccination coverage [18]. Our data can not to be applied to the general
estimates due to the absence in the survey of subjects aged 17 or younger. Whereas, the vaccination
coverage observed in those aged 65 years or older appeared to be quite comparable to that reported
by the official estimates (53.4%

vs 54.6%, respectively). Although slightly increasing in recent years,

the percentage observed in our study is lower than the target coverage of 75% in those aged 65 years
or older. These data are particularly worrisome, because in the current fall/winter season in the
northern hemisphere, with the concomitant co-circulation of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2
viruses, we will face a major challenge due to diagnostic and clinical problems in the presence of
upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms [19]. Based on these concerns, for the 2020/2021 flu
season the Italian ministry of Health recommends extending the vaccination coverage to the whole
population, free of charge also for subject aged between 60 and 64 years [20]. If the free-of-charge
administration of the influenza vaccine in this age-group will improve the uptake is to be
demonstrated, but it will help to quantify the impact of the economical barrier to vaccination.
Recent findings support the need to increase the vaccination coverage, considering, on top of the
well-known health and economic advantages, also the observed association between flu vaccination
and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab positivity [15] and lower COVID-19 severity
and mortality [21-23]. Therefore, the impact of vaccinations should be assessed not only based on
their ability to prevent the related infections, but also on their broader impact on other
communicable and not-communicable diseases occurring concurrently in the target population.
Our findings highlight a worrisome low vaccination coverage in subjects aged between 60-64 years
and 65-69 years (26.7% and 44.7%, respectively). The low vaccination coverage in this group could be
partially explained by a self-perception of wellbeing and low risk perception [24]. Nevertheless,
these age groups are at high risk of COVID-19 complications and mortality, as observed in the Italian
COVID-19 patients, therefore strategies to overcome their hesitancy towards vaccines and to
increase vaccine accessibility and uptake are of paramount relevance [4, 25].
Another interesting finding observed is that people with higher education level seems to be better
predisposed to vaccination when compared to the low socio-economic level. If on the one hand, low
education level is a known general barrier to vaccines [26] on the other, our sample of generally
higher educational level compared to the general population, reported overall a low uptake,
meaning that multiple factors, beyond health literacy and access to health care services, need to be
addressed. Moreover, the finding of a higher coverage among those with comorbidities suggest an
attitude to consider the vaccination as a relevant intervention mainly for individuals at high risk,
and not as a meaningful intervention for health promotion [27].
Our results showed that patients with heart and lung diseases seem to have a higher odds of being
vaccinated when compared to those with other comorbidities, in particular kidney and liver disease.
These findings raise particular concern, because it is clearly demonstrated that patients with chronic
conditions,

not

only

cardiovascular

or

respiratory

diseases,

are

at

higher

risk

of

many

vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza, that increase the risk of serious complications,
hospitalization, and death. Moreover, vaccine preventable diseases are more difficult to manage,
because of increased risk of drug interactions and potential adverse effects [27].
In our study, flu vaccination resulted positively associated with being a health care worker,
compared to other work-categories. Nevertheless, an extremely low percentage of health care
workers respondents accounting for 35.7% received a flu shot in the last season. Although the
percentage reported in our study is surprisingly higher compared to that reported in the literature in
Italian health care workers, ranging from 14% [28] to 16% [29], it underlines the need for urgent
measures to increase vaccination coverage in Italian health care workers. Vaccination of health care
workers against influenza is a key component of infection control, and the rationale for it is based on
the need to protect the health care workers and their high-risk patients in nursing homes, hospitals,

and outpatient clinics. Moreover, in time of extreme demand, reducing the absenteeism due to
influenza and its complications, contributes to the preservation of the essential health care services.
The finding that nursing home residents aged 65 years or older have a 61% higher odds of not being
vaccinated compared to the rest of the population was unexpected and definitively worrisome.
These subjects have high rates of underlying medical conditions and, therefore, are at higher risk of
infectious disease outbreaks. As we have learned during the recent pandemic, about half of deaths
due to COVID-19 were among nursing homes residents, underlying a critical health disparity that
need to be addressed urgently.

Increased vaccination rates and increased testing for preventable

infectious disease of residents and staff, and increased access to personal protective measures and
equipment are mandatory in all nursing homes, in order to protect this vulnerable subgroup of our
population [30-32].

4.1 Strengths and limitations
The main strength of our research was the possibility to assess factors associated with flu vaccination
in a large unselected group of respondents to an online survey. In fact, Italian estimates on past flu
vaccination seasons reported aggregated data for the general population and for those aged 65 years
or older but failed to address among the target group which are categories with significant barriers
to achieve the pre-planned goal for flu vaccine coverage.
Our study has several limitations. First, the absence of subjects aged below 18 years makes
impossible the comparison of our data with that of the Italian general population reported by the
ministry of health. Second, the high percentage of high education and health care workers observed
in our sample should be considered in the interpretation of the results for the possible impact on
behaviours

and

opportunities

toward a

better

health.

Third,

caution

is

the

demographic curve and consequently our findings could be not completely generalizable to the
Italian population.

5. Conclusions
Our data confirm a low vaccination coverage in the overall respondents to the online EPICOVID 19
survey and in particular, far below the national recommendations in target populations, such as
those 65 years or older, in subjects at high risk due to chronic conditions and in health care workers.
In the perspective of the next fall winter season, with the probable co-circulation of influenza and
SARS-CoV-2 in the norther hemisphere, the population will remain vulnerable to concurrent
epidemics. The morbidity and mortality impact will be directly related to the strength of the public
health response, which must be based on effective infection prevention tools currently available: the
non-pharmacologic

interventions

(i.e. social

distance

and face masks)

and the

widespread

implementation of influenza vaccination to fill the gap of missed vaccination opportunities reported
in the past flu seasons.
