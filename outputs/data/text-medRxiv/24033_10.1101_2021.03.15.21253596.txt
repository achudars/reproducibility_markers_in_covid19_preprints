ABSTRACT
Clinical data networks that leverage large volumes of data in electronic health records (EHRs) are
significant resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data harmonization
is a key challenge in seamless use of multisite EHRs for COVID-19 research. We developed a
COVID-19 application ontology in the national Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network that enables harmonization of data elements that that are critical to COVID-19 research. The ontology
contains over 50,000 concepts in the domains of diagnosis, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. In particular, it has computational phenotypes to characterize the course of illness and
outcomes, derived terms, and harmonized value sets for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests. The ontology was deployed and validated on the ACT COVID-19 network that consists of nine academic
health centers with data on 14.5M patients. This ontology, which is freely available to the entire
research community on GitHub at https://github.com/shyamvis/ACT-COVID-Ontology, will be
useful for harmonizing EHRs for COVID-19 research beyond the ACT network.
Keywords: COVID-19; electronic health records; clinical data network; ontology

1 INTRODUCTION

On March 11, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization [1]. The striking transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the rapid spread
of COVID-19 worldwide that has severely strained healthcare delivery systems and public health
agencies around the globe. Vast gaps in knowledge remain in understanding the natural course of
the disease and characterization of risk factors of disease severity and poor outcomes. A significant source of data for COVID-19 research is patient data captured in electronic health records
(EHRs). To leverage EHRs for COVID-19 research, several large clinical data networks including
the Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network [2], the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research
Network (PCORnet) [3] and the All of Us Research Program [4] enhanced their capabilities to conduct COVID-19 EHR-based research. In addition, several dedicated consortia have been formed,
including the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative (N3C) [5] and the Consortium for Clinical
Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) [6].
The ACT network is a federated network of Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA)
sites that has implemented an efficient and extensible electronic infrastructure to transform clinical
and translational research [2]. The goal of the ACT network is to enable investigators to perform
cohort exploration, analyze data, and identify patients who are eligible for clinical trials on a national scale using EHR data. The network currently consists of EHR data on more than 150 million
patients across 50 CTSA sites.
The technology underpinning the ACT network consists of local Informatics for Integrating Biology at the Bedside (i2b2) [7] and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) [8] EHR
repositories that are integrated by the Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE)
platform [9]. The SHRINE platform facilitates the querying of EHRs in real time across the network with an easy-to-use query tool that is based on the i2b2 Query and Analysis Tool [10]. The
SHRINE query tool employs a user-friendly query language that enables querying data across the
sites in the network using medical terminologies where in each terminology the terms are arranged
in a hierarchy for easy navigation. In the context of SHRINE, we call a terminology with hierarchical relations an application ontology (or simply ontology). The SHRINE ontologies have a
tree-like hierarchical structure in which concepts closer to the root are more general than concepts
located near the leaves. The tree-like structure enables the investigator to navigate the concepts and
construct succinct queries by using the most general concepts that are applicable. The SHRINE
query tool enables an investigator to drag and drop concepts from one or more ontologies to construct Boolean complex queries with operators such as negation, disjunction, and conjunction of
concepts. Furthermore, temporal operators are available to define further constraints. The use of
ontologies makes SHRINE a highly flexible network that facilitates addition of new concepts and
entire ontologies based on research needs and new types of data.
Since the formation of the ACT network in 2015, the data harmonization work group has developed and distributed ontologies to the ACT sites. Each site installs the ACT ontologies and maps
the concepts in the ACT ontologies to codes in the local i2b2 databases. Thus, the ACT ontologies
achieve syntactic interoperability and local mappings achieve semantic interoperability across the
network. The network is currently using ACT Ontology 2.0.1, which is based on the 2018AA
release of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Knowledge Sources [11]. The ontologies are in the domains of demographics, diagnoses (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM), procedures
(ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-PCS, CPT-4, HCPCS), medications (alphabetical, VA class), laboratory test
results (LOINC), and visits. The ontologies are available for download at the ACT Network Wiki
(https://dbmi-pitt.github.io/).
In response to the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, we mobilized the ACT network to
support COVID-19 research at a national scale. To do so, we developed and deployed a COVID-19
application ontology and augmented EHR data to support the terms in the ontology. We believe
that this ontology is accurate and useful not only to the ACT network but to other COVID-19 research efforts. However, we recognize that the ontology is likely incomplete and that there are
limitations to the mapping of local codes and terms to ontology concepts that limit the comprehensiveness of the queries that can be constructed.

2 OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to develop and validate a COVID-19 ontology and to deploy it on the ACT
network so that individual sites could augment the data to support the ontology. An important goal
was to include concepts that would be particularly useful in COVID-19 research such as disease
severity, events in the course of the disease, and outcomes.

3 METHODS
To obtain input from a diverse group of ACT members we communicated through weekly online
meetings, a shared GitHub repository, and an i2b2 server dedicated for viewing the ontology as it
was developed. We established the following process to develop, validate, and deploy the ontology:
1. Determining coverage: We identified concepts that would be needed to capture important aspects of COVID-19, based on which we iteratively determined broad areas of coverage.
2. Developing ontology: A draft ontology was developed that included emerging ICD-10, CPT4, HCPCS, and LOINC codes, computable phenotypes to characterize the course of illness and
outcomes, harmonized value sets for COVID-19 laboratory tests, and derived concepts. The draft
ontology was loaded into the dedicated i2b2 server and iteratively modified using feedback.
3. Validity testing: We deployed the ontology on a COVID-19 ACT network that consisted of nine
ACT sites. This allowed for testing the validity of the ontology and uncovering local codes and
terms that were missing in the computable phenotypes and derived concepts as well as uncovering
values in COVID-19 laboratory tests that needed harmonization.
4. Refining ontology: Using feedback from validity testing, we added additional concepts and
codes to the computable phenotypes and derived concepts, and included additional values in the
COVID-19 laboratory tests.
5. Implementation testing: After deployment of the refined ontology on the COVID-19 ACT network, we conducted ‘smoke’ tests and performed data characterization of key concepts in the
ontology to ensure quality of the data at the sites.
We repeated the above process for the development and release of each new version of the ontology.

4 RESULTS
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we developed, released and deployed three versions of the
ontology. The latest ontology, ACT COVID-19 Version 3, consists of 52,476 terms in the domains
of diagnosis, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. We included terms and their associated
codes from commonly used terminologies that include ICD-10-CM, CPT-4, HCPCS, LOINC, and
SNOMED-CT. In addition, we crafted computable phenotypes, derived concepts and harmonized
value sets that are pertinent to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 ontology has several unique features to enable users to conveniently query with
terms that are related to the course of illness and outcomes (see Figure 1). We highlight the following five categories of terms. 1) We identified and categorized emerging codes from ICD-10, CPT-4,
HCPCS, and LOINC terminologies that were introduced in response to SARS-CoV-2. Table 1 lists
the emerging codes that are included in the ontology. 2) We created computable phenotypes to
characterize the course of illness and outcomes in COVID-19 that included illness severity [12],
respiratory therapy management, and level of care. We developed computable phenotypes for three
levels of illness severity – moderate, severe, and death – and for four levels of respiratory therapy management – supplemental oxygen, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) – and for each of these phenotypes we collected a set of relevant
codes from ICD-10, CPT-4, and DRG. Example definitions of moderate illness and mechanical
ventilation are shown in Table 2. Since there is variability across the sites in codes that are relevant
to inferring illness severity, we iteratively identified and added codes based on the experience at
the sites. 3) We created several derived terms and assigned them UMLS codes; for example, we
included a "Moderate Illness (Derived)" concept with UMLS code C4740691 in the computable

phenotype for moderate illness, and a "Mechanical Ventilation (Derived)" concept with UMLS
code C0199470 in the computable phenotype for mechanical ventilation (see Table 2). These derived terms are useful in mapping data from EHRs of patients who are currently hospitalized and
for which ICD-10 or CPT-4 codes may not be available since this coding typically occurs at or just
after discharge. They are also useful for capturing additional local codes that are not part of the
computable phenotype definition. 4) We created harmonized value sets for the growing number
of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid antigen and antibody tests. The harmonized values are comprised
of positive, negative, equivocal, and pending values and allow mapping of variously reported
results to a set of four standardized values. The implementation of this mapping was a substantial undertaking at the participating sites and provided the key ability to query with standardized
SARS-CoV-2 tests. 5) We identified terms in existing ACT ontologies that are likely to be useful for COVID-19 research and included them in the COVID-19 ontology for convenience. For
example, we identified and added classes of medications that are relevant to COVID-19 research.

5 DISCUSSION
In response to the pandemic, we mobilized the ACT network to develop and deploy a COVID-19
ontology to enable real-time cohort discovery across the ACT network. The development, implementation and validation steps described in the Methods section enabled us to rapidly develop and
test a comprehensive COVID-19 ontology. We developed and released three versions of the ontology, evaluated the utility and the completeness of the computable phenotypes, assessed correctness

of mapping of local codes and terms to the derived terms, and created a nine-site ACT COVID-19
network with access to the EHRs of 14.5M patients.
We have made the COVID-19 ontology files with accompanying documentation freely
available to the entire research community on GitHub at https://github.com/shyamvis/ACTCOVID-Ontology. Furthermore, the ontology can be browsed freely at http://dbmi-ncatstest01.dbmi.pitt.edu/webclient/. We will continue to develop and release new versions at these
websites.
A limitation of the ontology is that the inclusion of codes and terms in the computable phenotypes
is based on a limited number of sites though we obtained feedback from nine large healthcare
systems across the United States. Thus, the heterogeneity of coding that we observed is likely
to be limited. As we deploy the ontology across all 50 sites in the ACT network, we will solicit
feedback and update the ontology iteratively. Another limitation is that new codes for COVID-19
are being continually introduced, especially LOINC codes for new SARS-CoV-2 tests. Therefore,
it is critical to keep the ontology updated with the newest codes. We plan to develop and publish
new versions of the ontology on a regular basis.
Though we primarily developed the COVID-19 ontology for the ACT network, the ontology is
has been leveraged by other COVID-19 research groups. In particular, the computable phenotypes
that characterize the severity COVID-19 and disease outcomes have be beneficial in standardizing
these computable phenotype definitions beyond the ACT network [12]. Since the publication of the
ontology, the 4CE, the N3C, and the PCORnet consortia have adapted the ontology for their own
use.

6 CONCLUSION
Multisite EHRs provide a unique source for rapid COVID-19 research using clinical data. We
developed a COVID-19 ontology to enable harmonization and querying of EHRs. The ontology
was validated on a nine-site network and is being deployed on the full ACT network. The ontology
offers a foundational first step for harmonizing EHRs for research on COVID-19.
