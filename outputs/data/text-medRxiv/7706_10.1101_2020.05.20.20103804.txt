Abstract

Introduction

Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a world-wide pandemic with an

enormous medical, societal, and economic toll. Thus, our aim was to gather all available information

regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features,

and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods

EMBASE, PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any

language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th. Original studies were included if the exposure

of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the

risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and

between risk factors and in-hospital mortality. Based on previous reports, we addressed the hypothesis

that male sex, older age, as well as pre-existing hypertension and diabetes mellitus are risk factors of

morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

th

, 2020, with search terms related to COVID-19 (“COVID-19”, “SARS-

CoV-2”, “coronavirus disease 2019”, “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, “2019 novel

coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, “coronavirus”, and “corona virus”). The full search strategy is provided in

Selection of studies

Two investigators (CRJ and MW) independently screened the titles and abstracts to determine whether

studies should be included. Eligibility criteria were also applied to the full-text articles during the final

selection. In case multiple articles reported on a single study, the article that provided the most data

was selected for further synthesis. We quantified the inter-rater agreement for study selection using

Cohen’s κ coefficient

(e.g., pediatric and adult patient), we extracted this information separately for each group. A full list of

extracted variables is provided in Supplementary Table 1.

2.5.

Statistical analysis

For the studies reporting mean and standard deviation (SD) for extracted variables, we computed the

median and interquartile ranges (IQR) assuming a normal distribution (i.e., using the formula: IQR ~

SD*1.35). To test if there is a bias by including the studies for which we computed the median and IQR

(i.e., quartiles, Q1 and Q3), we performed a sensitivity analyses in which we calculated the median and

IQR

under

the

assumption

of

right-skewed

and

left-skewed

distribution

(see

Appendix

2).

We

compared the results of the different distributions to test the robustness of our findings. Descriptive

statistics (median, IQR, n, and %) were used to characterize the studies and patients included as well as

the laboratory parameters. Weighted by study sample size, the pooled median and 95% confidence

interval (CI) were computed for continuous variables. Normality approximation of the binomial was

used to construct an approximate confidence interval (R package metamedian

17

). Welch’s two-sample t-

test was employed to test if there are significant differences in the proportion of male and female

patients across studies.

Our meta-analysis was structured in two parts. In the first part, we performed meta-analyses of all 148

In terms of study population, 114 studies included only adult participants, 6 only pregnant women, 22

patients, 91.0%), pregnant (35 patients, 0.3%), and pediatric (1'056 patients, 8.7%; including neonates)

patients was 47.0 years [35.0-65.3] (Figure 3A), 30.0 [26.0-33.0] Figure 3B, and 10.0 [2.0-13.0] (Figure

3C), respectively. Approximately 7.8% (297/ 3’822 patients) were reported to be asymptomatic and 7.7%

(617/ 8’047) died during hospitalization due to complications related to the infection with SARS-CoV-2.

With the exception of one 10-month old child, all deaths were non-pregnant adult COVID-19 patients.

Adult patients

Higher proportions of male than female patients were reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (t =

2.678, df = 202, p-value = 0.008; Figure 2A) across all studies. Comorbidities were present in ~31% of

the adult patients (2’329/ 7’608), with hypertension being the most prevalent one (1’352/ 6’460 patients,

20.93%),

followed by

(37/ 354 patients,

Figure 1). The most frequent clinical signs and symptoms were fever (6’955/ 8’859 patients, 78.5%),

cough (4’778/ 8’885 patients, 53.8%), and fatigue (1’996/ 7’980 patients, 25.0%) (Figure 4B, Table 4). A

little over five percent of the adult COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic (148/ 2’749 patients, 5.4%).

Amongst the survivors (7’111/ 7’727 patients, 92.0%), a total of 3’025 (68.7%) remained hospitalized,

1’751 (32.4%) were discharged, and 1’012 (27.1%) reportedly recovered (Figure 4C, Table 4). Important

to note, for some patients it was stated that they both, recovered and were discharged (i.e., one patient

can fall in multiple categories). The median duration between symptoms onset and hospitalization was

8 days [7 - 9.5].

A total of 195 (6.8%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The most

frequently reported complications associated with COVID-19 were pneumonia (1’032/ 1’489 patients,

69.2%), respiratory failure (141/ 413 patients, 34.1%), acute cardiac injury (242/ 1’250 patients, 19.4%),

(31/ 52, 59.6%) to treat COVID-19 and its complications (Supplementary Figure 8, Supplementary

Table 6). With the exception of a 10-month-old child that died four weeks after admission of multi-

organ failure, all children survived. Less than 30% remained hospitalized (90/ 293 patients), 74.5% were

discharged (216/ 290 patients) and 87.4% reportedly recovered (236/ 270 patients) (Supplementary

Figure 9, Supplementary Table 6). The median duration between symptoms onset and hospitalization

was 6 days [4.0-8.5]. Fifteen percent (6/ 39 patients) had to be admitted to the ICU. Complications

associated with COVID-19 comprised pneumonia (16/ 26 patients, 61.5%), secondary bacterial infection

(12/ 21 patients, 57.1%), and respiratory failure (10/ 33 patients, 30.3%) ( Supplementary Table 6).

Non-severe vs. Severe

Twelve studies (2’596 patients) provided separate data for patients with a severe (500 patients, 19.3%)

and non-severe disease status (2’096, 80.7%). No differences regarding sex were found between severe

(t = 0.604, df = 16.645, p-value = 0.554; male: 278 patients [55.6%] and female: 210 patients [42.0%];

unknown sex: 12 patients [2.4%]) and non-severe disease status group (t = 0.217, df = 16.393, p-value =

0.831; male: 1’059 patients [50.5%] and female: 925 patients [49.5%]) (Supplementary Figure 10 ). In

terms of age, patients with non-severe COVID-19 were significantly younger (median age in years= 45.0

[34.0-57.0]) than those with a severe disease progression (61.4 [44.5-75.5], Figure 5). Our meta-analysis

revealed that older age (SMD: 0.68 [0.40-0.97]; p < 0.001), being male (RR = 1.11 [1.01-1.22]; p = 0.039),

The risk of any heart condition remained significantly elevated in the severe disease patient cohort (RR

= 3.87 [1.85 - 8.11], p = 0.005). Numerous laboratory parameters were significantly different between

the

and

cohorts.

with non-severe disease status. Additionally, C-reactive protein (SMD = 1.47 [0.88-2.07]; p < 0.001),

lactate dehydrogenase (SMD = 1.71 [1.08-2.34]; p < 0.001), and aspartate transaminase levels (SMD =

studies is small (i.e., fewer than 10) as we only included 4-8 studies.

Survivor vs. non-survivors

Seven studies (957 patients) provided disaggregated data for COVID-19 survivors (617 patients, 64.5%)

and non-survivors (340, 35.5%). No differences regarding sex were found in the survivor group (t =

0.258, df = 11.879, p-value = 0.801; male: 326 patients [52.8%] and female: 291 patients [47.2%]), but a

significantly higher proportion of male patients were amongst the deceased cohort (t = 4.30, df = 12, p-

value = 0.001; male: 236 patients [69.4%] and female: 104 patients [30.6%]) ( Supplementary Figure

10). In terms of age, COVID-19 patients that survived were significantly younger (median age in years=

52.0 [35.0-66.0]) than non-survivors (68.0 [62.0-76.0], Figure 5). The meta-analysis yielded older age

[1.03-15.20], p = 0.047, Figure 7A), and hypertension (RR = 2.09 [1.65-2.64]; p = 0.001) were found to be

associated with the highest risks of mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms as well as imaging features

were comparable between survivors and non-survivors. In terms of treatments, non-survivors were

more frequently mechanically ventilated than survivors (RR = 6.05 [1.41-26.05]; p = 0.026, Figure 7B)

associated with death (Table 5). Publication bias, measured by means of the Egger’s test, was only

evident in five analyses.

excluded grey literature (e.g., preprints, reports, conference proceedings), the importance of which to

treatments, and outcome potentially depends on the country (and its healthcare system). There is also

a considerable risk for a reporting bias towards comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory

parameters, imaging features, treatment, outcome, and complications that are present. Specifically,

only a minority of studies reported a zero when this information was assessed, but absent in patients.

Lack of data on absent clinical signs and symptoms might lead to distorted estimates of proportion.

The meta-analysis of severity and mortality could only be performed with a small number of studies as

the minority of the 148 provided data separately for different disease severity groups (e.g., non-severe,

severe, survivors, non-survivors). This needs to be considered when interpreting the results, including

the publication bias as the Egger's test may lack the statistical power to detect bias when the number of

studies is small (i.e., < 10). Lastly, the criteria to classify patients in severe and non-severe COVID-19

disease cohorts varied between studies leading to additional heterogeneity between studies. By virtue

of low number of studies available, we could not assess this heterogeneity nor adjust for it.

of

the

literature published during the first 120 days of the COVID-19 pandemic yields important information

regarding the comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters, imaging features,

treatment, outcome, and complications. Male sex, older age, and pre-existing comorbidities are major

risk factors for in-hospital mortality and complications. This study revealed a fatality rate of 7.7% and

found that approximately 8% of the patients were reportedly asymptomatic. Based on recent reports,

the latter number is likely 6- to 10-fold higher as only a few asymptomatic patients are captured by the

health care system as they do not seek medical attention due to the lack of symptoms

168

or are not

hospitalized and thus, included in studies. Unnoticed asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 are likely a

major source of ongoing transmission. Children and neonates appear to be the least vulnerable cohort.

4.6. Figure legends
Figure 1. Flow-chart of the search strategy.
A total of 148 studies were eligible for the literature review and the first part of the meta-analysis (i.e., prevalence).
Nine-teen studies were included in the second part of the meta-analysis (i.e., severity and mortality).

Figure 2. Proportion of female and male patients in adult (A) and pediatric/neonatal cohort (B).
All case studies/ reports were pooled together for visualization (CS_adult, and CS_children [pediatric/neonatal]).
The key to the study identifier can be found in Tables 1 (adults) and Table 3 (children).

Figure 3. Age of adult (A), pregnant (B), and pediatric/neonatal (C) COVID-19 patients included in eligible
studies.
Median age and interquartile ranges (IQR) are represented by the midpoints and error bars, respectively. The
studies have been sorted by patients’ median age in years. The size of the midpoint (circle, square, triangle)
indicates the study sample size. The red line indicates the pooled median age of the respective cohort. All adult
case studies/ reports (CS_adult) were pooled for the visualization reasons. The key to the study identifier can be
found in Table 1 (adults), Table 2 (pregnant women), and Table 3 (children).

Figure 4. Comorbidities (A), Clinical signs and symptoms (B), outcomes (C), and treatments administered (D)
to adult COVID-19 patients.
The colors indicated the proportion of patients (%, 0 = yellow, 100 = dark purple). Note: Missing values are colored
in white.

Figure 5. Age of non-severe (A), severe (B), survivor (C), and non-survivor (D) COVID-19 patients included in
eligible studies.
The median age and Interquartile ranges (IQR) are represented by the midpoints and error bars, respectively. The
studies have been sorted by patients’ median age in years. The size of the midpoint indicates the study sample size.
The red line indicates the pooled median age of the respective cohort. The key to the study identifier can be found
in Table 1.

Figure 6. Relative risks of comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and COPD) and complications
(i.e., ARDS) in patients with a severe COVID-19 disease progression.
Funnel plots indicate the potential of publication bias. The key to the study identifier can be found in Table 1.

Figure 7. Relative risks of comorbidity (i.e., any heart condition), treatment (i.e., mechanical ventilation), and
complications (i.e., acute kidney injury and ARDS) in survivors and non-survivors.
Funnel plots indicate the

potential of publication bias. The key to the study identifier can be found in Table 1.
