Abstract

30

We applied XNA-based Molecular Clamping Technology to develop a multiplex qPCR assay for

31

rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. A total of 278 previously tested SARS-

32

COV-2 positive samples originating primarily from San Francisco Bay Area were tested, including

33

139 Samples collected in middle January and 139 samples collected at the end of February 2021,

34

respectively. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike-gene D614G mutation was detected from 58 samples (41.7%)

35

collected in January 2021 and, 78 samples (56.1%) collected in February. Notably, while there were

36

no N501Y mutation detected in samples from January, seven of the February samples were tested

37

positive for the N501Y and D614G mutations. The results suggest a relatively recent and speedy

38

spreading of the UK variant (B.1.1.7) in Northern California. This new Molecular Clamping

39

technology-based multiplex RT-qPCR assay is highly sensitive and specific and can help speed up

40

large scale testing for SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Introduction

56

While the worldwide vaccination efforts ongoing, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to spread

57

with 120 million cases and 2.7 million deaths to date (March 2021). In the United States alone,

58

there are currently over 30 million cases, and the death toll has passed 550 thousand. With the

59

vaccinations picking up steam and more and more people acquiring immunity to the SARS-CoV-2,

60

the focus is now shifting to more transmissible and potentially vaccine resistant novel variants of

61

the virus. At present, at least four SARS-CoV-2 variants, all present in the USA, the UK B.1.1.7

62

(501Y V1) [1], South Africa B.1.351 (501Y.V2) [2], Brazil P.1 (501Y.V3) [3] and CAL.20C

63

(20C/S:452R; /B.1.429) [4] [5] variants are of particular concern. Lineage B.1.1.7, is also known

64

as 20I/501Y.V1, variant of concern 20DEC-01 (VOC-20DEC-01, previously written as VOC-

65

202012/01) or commonly as the UK variant. It was found in the southeast of England in early

66

October 2020 and has been observed to be increasing in both Europe and the United States [6-9]. It

67

is estimated to be 40%–80% more transmissible than the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 [10-11].

68
69

Looking at the mutations present in these 4 main variants of concern, all of them have the D614G

70

mutation, and three of them share the N501Y mutation (except CAL.20C variant). Both mutations

71

are located on SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. With the D614G mutation, the amino acid change

72

from aspartic acid to glycine is caused by an A-to-G nucleotide mutation at position 23403 of the

73

virus genome. This change stabilizes the spike protein and enhances its fitness and infectivity [12].

74

Similar to D614G, N501Y mutation is also associated with higher virus infectivity and even worse,

75

the N501Y mutation is within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, featured by

76

stronger binding to ACE2 receptor and significant drop of the original vaccine efficacy [13]. These

77

two mutations, D614G and N501Y, are the two earliest and prominent mutations observed thus far

78

as the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve.

80

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been the standard method for SARS-CoV-2 variants

81

detection. Although the NGS-based assays could confirm the variants, it is expensive, time

82

consuming and not widely available, limiting its utility in large scale testing demand for SARS-

83

CoV-2 variants detection and monitoring. There has been an urgent need for testing platforms that

84

could detect these variants of concern rapidly and cost-effectively. In this study we applied a

85

Molecular Clamping Technology by using xenonucleic acids (XNA) and developed a multiplex

86

reverse-transcription qPCR assay that can accurately and quickly detects known and emerging

87

SARS-CoV-2 mutations (Fig 1).

88
89

Xenonucleic acids (XNAs) are artificial genetic polymers retaining the Watson-Crick base-pairing

90

capability, originally developed to store genetic information and evolved in response to external

91

stimuli. For practical applications in disease diagnosis and treatment, they can also function as a

92

source of nuclease-resistant affinity reagents (aptamers) and catalysts (xenozymes). More notably,

93

they can be employed as molecular clamps in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions

94

(RT-qPCR) or as highly specific molecular probes for detection of nucleic acid target sequences,

95

due to its characteristic and stronger hybridization in XNA/DNA than DNA/DNA [14].

96

Furthermore, even a single base-pair mismatch between XNA/DNA duplex can result in a drop of

97

10-18°C in melting temperature Tm [15], allowing the highly specific clamping of XNA molecule

98

onto the targeted sequence (usually wildtype, WT) to block the WT amplification, thus minimizing

99

the WT background in RT-qPCR and selectively enhancing the signal of the mutant. The robust

100

XNAs have been extensively used in the in vitro diagnostic assays for detecting cancer-associated

101

gene mutations [16]. Theoretically, XNAs should work in RT-qPCR-based detection of SARS-

102

CoV-2 mutations.

103
104

Our report here represents the first attempt of using XNA-based QClamp application in SARS-

105

CoV-2 mutation assay. We expect this fast, reliable and inexpensive mutation detection assay, as

106

we intended to develop, can be made widely available for detecting and monitoring known and

107

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants during the ongoing CAVID-19 pandemic.

108

access to SARS-Cov-2 mutation testing can also help enable real-time tracking of virus

109

transmission chains and routes in various regions of the world [17].

Study design and ethics

113

Deidentified leftover patient nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and saliva samples were used in the study.

114

All patient specimens were collected in January and February 2021 and previously tested at UCSF

115

affiliated San Francisco VA Medical Center clinical laboratory and DiaCarta CLIA certified clinical

116

laboratory for clinical diagnostic or screening purpose. Other than qualitative RT-PCR results

117

(positive or negative), only PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were included in study analysis and no

118

patient clinical chart reviews were performed. This study was approved by the institutional review

119

board (IRB) at UCSF (UCSF IRB #11-05207) as a no-subject contact study with waiver of consent

120

and as exempt under category 4.

123

Saliva and NPS samples of patients were used in the study. All patient specimens were collected,

124

tested and resulted in January and February 2021 and subsequently stored in -80°C freezer. A total

125

of 278 positive samples were selected for this study, including 139 collected in middle January and

126

139 collected in late February. Other than the qualitative RT-PCR results (positive or negative),

127

only PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained and included in this study analysis.

RNA extraction

130

Automatic RNA/DNA extraction instrument MGISP-960 (MGI Tech Co., Ltd.) and MGI Easy

131

Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (Cat# 1000020261) was used for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA

132

extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 180 µL of each nasopharyngeal

133

swab sample or saliva sample was used for extraction. For each batch of clinical samples to be

134

tested, a RNA extraction control (EC) was included (spike 20 µL of EC from the QuantiVirus™

135

SARS-CoV-2 multiplex kit (DiaCarta, Inc.) into 180 µL sterile RNase-free water). The clinical

136

samples and spiked EC were processed and extracted on the MGI platform. The extraction output is

137

RNA in 30-40 µL RNase-free water, 1 µL of which is used for the RT-qPCR reaction. Precautions

138

were taken while handling extracted RNA samples to avoid RNA degradation. Extracted RNA

139

samples were stored at -80°C if not immediately used for RT-qPCR. The turnaround time from

140

sample extraction to PCR final report is about 4 hrs (Fig 1) [18].

Multiplex primer and probe design

143

We targeted the conserved regions of E gene and ORF1ab gene [18] and adjacent areas to the

144

N501Y and D614G mutations in the SARS-Cov-2 genome to design primers and probes for the

145

detection all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Similarly, we designed primers and probes for the

146

human RNase P gene, used as RNA extraction control.

147

Gene sequences were retrieved from GenBank and GISAID databases for primer and probe design

148

to ensure coverage of all SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. Multiple alignments of the collected

149

sequences were performed using Qiagen CLC Main Workbench 20.0.4., and conserved regions in

150

each target gene were identified using BioEditor 7.2.5. prior to primer and probe designs. Primers

151

and probes were designed to target the most conserved regions of each of the target genes of the

152

viral genome, using Primer3plus software and following general rules of real-time PCR design. All

153

primers were designed with a melting temperature (Tm) of approximately 60 C and the probes

154

were designed with a Tm of about 65 C. The amplicon sizes were kept as minimum within the

155

range of 70 bp to 150 bp for each primer pair to achieve better amplification efficiency and

156

detection sensitivity. All designed primers and probes were ordered from Integrated DNA

157

Technologies, Inc. (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) and LGC Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA,

158

USA), respectively.

160

XNA design, synthesis, purification and analysis

161

The xenonucleic acids (XNAs) for SARS-COV-2 N501Y and D614G mutations were designed to

162

match the wild type (WT) sequences in order to make them selectively block the qPCR

163

amplification of the WT targets. Each XNA was also designed to partially overlap with and be of

164

the same strand/sense as the corresponding fluorescent probe.

165
166

All chemicals and solvents are of ACS grade or higher, purchased from Sigma, Fisher Scientific,

167

Beantown Chemicals, Midland Scientific and other commercial sources. XNAs were synthesized

via classic solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) method on an INTAVIS MultiPep automatic

169

synthesizer (INTAVIS Bioanalytical Instruments AG, Cologne, Germany; now a subsidiary of

170

CEM Corporation) [19]. Commercially-available primary Bhoc-protected monomers with

171

aminoethylglycine(AEG)-backbone (Fmoc-“A”, Fmoc-“T”, Fmoc-“C”, Fmoc-“G”), plus terminus-

172

modifying monomers Fmoc-D-Lysine(tBoc) and Fmoc-“O” spacer/linker, were used as the starting

173

materials. TentaGel Resin (from INTAVIS) was chosen and used as the solid support for the

174

multiple-sequence parallel synthesis at a typical 3-umol scale using INTAVIS mini columns. The

175

stepwise SPPS process follows the standard Fmoc chemistry starting from 3’ toward 5’ direction in

176

DMF medium, mainly using HATU for coupling and piperidine for deprotection, within each cycle

177

of solid-phase synthesis, then followed by a new cycle again, keeps repeating itself, untill

178

completion of the entire XNA sequence. After the solid-phase synthesis procedure, the crude

179

product was obtained after a cleavage/deprotection step with a TFA-based cocktail, containing 3-5%

180

triisopropylsilane to minimize side reactions. The resulting off-white crude product then underwent

181

fast purification procedure by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with G-25 Sephadex gel (GE

182

Healthcare). For each of 7 XNAs synthesized, right after the SEC step, the highest-concentration

183

fraction, as the main product, was identified by UV quantification at 260 nm (NanoDrop ND-1000)

184

and subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC (Agilent 1100 HPLC system, Aeris XB-C18 HPLC

185

column of 100 x 4.5 mm, UV detection at 260 nm, column temperature 50 °C), and by mass

186

spectrometry (Shimadzu Axima MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer at UCSF DeGrado Lab). The

187

characteristic XNA identity and molecular weight were confirmed for all 7 XNA products. The

188

selected SEC-fraction of each XNA was thus used for RT-qPCR assay accordingly.

We created three XNAs for N501Y, four XNAs for D614G. A serial dilution XNA qPCR test for

estimate the assay sensitivity due to no SARS-CoV-2 variant refence is commercially available. We

216

used a two-fold dilution series from 800 copies/mL to 25 copies/mL of the templates in triplicates

217

and confirmed the lowest concentration that was detectable with 95% confidence.

XNA design and synthesis

221

The sequences of XNAs were designed in the context of rational selection of primer/probe for the

222

chosen target gene sequence, intended to match perfectly with the wild-type target DNA sequence.

223

The best sequences (3-4 sequences each target) were iteratively adjusted and selected based on the

224

criterion of multiple major physicochemical factors: sequence length, GC content, purine content

225

and arrangement, self-complementarity, and melting temperature. High overall synthetic yields

226

were found for the D614 XNA group (about 5-10%) while good yields for the N501 XNA group

227

(~5%), translating to a 85-92% single-cycle yield, averagely, across all XNA synthesis here.

228

MALDI-MS Spectra of two representative XNA biomolecules D614 XNA001 and N501 XNA003

229

were shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1.

231

XNA enhance distinguishing mutant to the wild type of SARS-CoV-2

232

In order to test whether XNA clamping the wild type and enhance mutant detection, we compare a

233

RT-qPCR with and without XNA. An amplification curve of D614G mutant vs wild type without

234

XNA shown that it is difficult to distinguish mutant and wild type (Supplementary Figure 1a).

235

However, with XNA, clearly it is easy to identify mutant to wild type of SARS-CoV-2

236

(Supplementary Fig 1b). To optimize the assay, we tested different concentration of XNA. The

237

optimization results of XNAs were exemplarily displayed in Supplementary Tables 2 & 3. The

238

XNA that generates the highest delta Ct value between wild type and mutants was selected for the

239

next step in RT-qPCR. Based on the results, we selected D614G XNA 001 & N501Y XNA 003

240

(Figure 2).

241
242

Analytical sensitivity

243

We performed the QClamp multiplex RT-qPCR with XNA on various equipment (BioRad CFX384,

244

Roche Light Cycler and QS5) and all the results were consistent. We diluted the patient sample

245

from 800 copies/mL down to 25 copies/mL and repeated RT-qPCR. Since we had confirmed Ct is

246

~34.28 for ORF1ab at 4plex SARS-CoV-2 detection assay when the viral concentration about 100

247

copies/mL [18], we applied this to estimate the assay sensitivity. The data shown that the Ct values

248

were around 33.4 for ORF1ab (wildtype) when estimated viral RNA concentration was at 100

249

copies/ml. Since N501Y and D614G mutant were detected, and its Ct were 34.07 and 33.78

250

separately (Table 1), so this indicate that the assay analytical sensitivity limit of detection (LoD) is

251

estimated approximately 100 copies/mL.

252
253

UK variant sped up in bay area of California.

254

In order to test whether there is the UK variant presenting in the San Francisco Bay Area, we

255

screened 139 known SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in January and 139 positive samples in

256

February 2021. Among the 139 positive specimens collected in mid-January 2021, 58 (41.7%)

257

were positive only for D614G but not the N501Y (Table 2). However, among the 139 positive

258

specimens collected at the end of February 2021, there were 7 (5.04%) specimens that were positive

259

for both N501Y and D614G mutations, consistent with the U.K. variant (B1.1.7) (Table 2).

260

Furthermore, the multiplex RT-qPCR test showed high specificity - amplification of all non-N501Y

261

samples and negative controls were inhibited in the qPCR, while only the N501Y variants and

262

positive controls were amplified (Figure 3).

263
264

In order to verify whether these fifty-eight D614G mutant and seven D614G/N501Y mutant

265

samples were truly mutants, we tested these samples’ amplicons by Sanger Sequencing. All of the

266

58 positive D614G and 7 positive D614G/N501Y mutant samples were confirmed by Sanger

267

Sequencing. The Sanger sequencing peaks showed the target mutant on viral cDNA T< C for

268

D614G (Figure 4a) and the target mutant substitution on viral cDNA A<T for N501Y (Figure 4 b).

269

All 58 positive D614G and 7 positive D614G/N501Y and 213 wild types were confirmed by Sanger

270

sequencing and indicates that its specificity is 100%.

272

Discussion

273

For a sensitive and specific molecular clamping QClamp assay, combined with a set of primers and

274

probe for a given gene mutation target, choosing an XNA with appropriate sequence and desired

275

characteristics is important. Our XNA selection process has two folds: first, in the sequence design

276

we already excluded those improper sequences with problematic features (too long or too short, Tm

277

too high or too low, high purine content, purine stretch, unwanted self-complementarity within or

278

between XNA molecules); second, for each mutation assay, 3 or 4 XNAs were designed and

279

synthesized, then compared side-by-side for their performance in RT-qPCR clamping robustness

280

(higher delta-Ct value preferred – greater Ct difference between wildtype gene and housekeeping

281

283

and N501 XNA003, were selected respectively for the two mutations detection. Notably, in both

284

groups, the XNA with Tm of nearly 80 °C stands out in selection process, which may be governed

285

by the established RT-qPCR temperature-cycling conditions. [22]

286
287

Due to its higher transmissibility the D614G variant is currently the dominant virus variant of

288

SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. Its sub-clade, the N501Y mutation has independently emerged

289

in the UK and South Africa and has been gaining ground recently. Our data suggests that its spread

290

in the Northern California has been a relatively recent event because the patient samples collected

291

in January 2021 were all negative for the N501Y mutation, whereas the N501Y mutation was

292

detected in 5% of the samples collected in late February. This prevalence of B1.1.7 is likely to

293

increase, considering the CDC also forecasted that the N501Y might become the main SARS-CoV-

294

2 variant according to the new epidemiology model [23].

295
296

In order to meet the challenge of spreading of SARS-CoV-2 variant strains , availability of rapid

297

and accurate testing platforms is critical. Amongst many detection methods, the qPCR-based

298

methods are regarded as the fastest and most cost-effective, also highly practical in the real-time

299

monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 evolution around the globe. To date, some biotechnology and

300

academic institutions have been developing or published corresponding detection methods using

301

qPCR, and most can be categorized as following: 1) mutant gene specific or allele-specific primer

302

and probe; 2) spike gene target failure (SGTF); 3) E gene target failure and 4) ORF gene deletion

303

[24-27]. Some of them still require NGS to confirm the results. Other testing platforms require pre-

304

testing by regular SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests before variants testing. These issues limit the use of

305

the currently available variant testing methodologies. Of particular note, among these methods, the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.21254484; this version posted April 5, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

306

allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) quickly attracted attention for mutation detection by some

307

developers. However, AS-PCR has two inherent shortcomings:1) Due to the fixed 3 end of the

308

allele-specific primer, it is not always feasible to choose optimal primers for PCR amplification; 2)

309

low-quality or cruder DNA/RNA samples could not work similarly well as the good quality ones

310

[28]. In both cases, XNA-based qPCR can help or excel because XNA sequences can be designed

311

with some more flexibility compared to restrictive primer sequence design [29], and because for

312

samples with low-concentration RNA, XNA-based qPCR can realize its full potential in detecting

313

low-concentration, high-background mutant gene targets.

′

314
315

The molecular clamping technology used in this study adds considerably to the sensitivity and

316

specificity to the conventional qPCR. Wild-type background amplification would be minimized.

317

Moreover, multiplexing QClamp qPCR tests could greatly improve the simultaneous detection of

318

multiple targets as well, as we could investigate the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 (ORF1ab gene for

319

wildtype detection) and variants in a single run. Furthermore, in addition to detecting the existing

320

SARS-CoV-2 mutations D614G and N501Y, as demonstrated in this study, the QClamp technology

321

can also be quickly expanded to other emerging mutants such as B.1.351’s E484K, which is of

322

particular concern because it can escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity [30].

323

This strategy can provide an effective and powerful testing platform for known and emerging

324

SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future. This technology can be easily adopted by all clinical

325

laboratories that perform SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.

326

CDC descripted 8337 cases of UK variant B1.1.7 and Helix has reported 499 cases of UK variant in

327

California (March 26, 2021) [8-9]. Wetested clinical samples and detected 7 cases of B1.1.7 from

328

139 randomly selected samples collected in late February 2021. The result suggests that there

329

could be higher prevalence of the UK variant (B1.1.7) in Northern California than previously

330

predicted. Challen et al reported that the mortality hazard ratio associated with VOC-202012/1

331

(UK variant B.1.1.7) infection was 1.64 in the community and increased in death rate from 2.5 to

332

4.1 per 1000 detected case, which translates to a 32-104% increased risk of death. Moreover, its

333

being 40% -80% more transmissible than wildtype SARS-CoV-2, making government agencies and

334

medical communities more worried about this variant [10-11]. The new variant with increased

335

transmissibility would lead to a potentially exponential increase in the resulting number of deaths

336

[10].

337
338

In summary, we have developed a multiplex qPCR testing platform for rapid detecting SARS-CoV-

339

2 variant strains, using XNA-based Molecular Clamping Technology. This testing platform can be

340

easily adopted by laboratories that perform SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, providing a practical

341

solution in lieu of NGS-based testing for detecting and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants.
