Abstract: We have studied the current COVID-19 spread situation in Assam, a State of India.
We have found that currently the spread pattern is indeed exponential and that it is not going to
show a reducing trend soon. As a result, it is not possible yet to forecast about the time of
peaking of the epidemic in Assam. It can be said that the COVID-19 situation in this Indian State
is very alarming even after five and a half months of the start of the epidemic in the State. It may
so happen that in Assam the spread would continue to grow exponentially even after the situation
changes in India as a whole.
Keywords: Pandemic, infectious disease, forecasts
Introduction
The commonly used mathematical models used for forecasting the spread of an epidemic are the
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model [1, 2, 3] and its modifications such as the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, the Susceptible-InfectiousRecovered-Dead (SIRD) model, and the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model. Due to
certain necessary assumptions made in these models, it is debatable whether such data dependent
models are everywhere applicable in the COVID-19 matters [4]. We shall in this article study the
current COVID-19 status as far as the spread is concerned in the State of Assam, India, without
using any standard epidemiological model.
We shall first describe some associated matters related to Assam so that the readers get an idea
about its demographic details. Assam is a State of India, located in the North-East. As per the
data of Census of India, 2011, the population of Assam was 31.2 million. As per Unique
Identification India data, updated on 31 May, 2020, the projected population of Assam is 35.6
million. The total area of the State is 78,438 sq km, with population density 397 per sq km.
Regarding COVID-19 spread, the daily data of the cumulative total number in India can be easily
found from Worldometers.info [5]. However this source shows the concerned data with reference
to Assam not from the beginning but from 16 August onwards. To collect the concerned data of
Assam from the beginning, we had to take resort to the following. From March 31, 2020, the
date on which the first COVID-19 patient was detected in Assam, to August 19, 2020, the daily
data are available in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Assam portal [6]. The data available in this
portal were not updated after August 19. Therefore to get the data thereafter, we had to rely on

the data made available online by the Assam COVID-19 Dashboard, Government of Assam [7].
However, in this portal data for every current day only are available. So as to get the earlier data,
one had to keep track of the updates everyday, which we have done, and we have the concerned
data till the present day. As has been mentioned earlier, the daily data are available in the
Worldometers.info [4] from August 16 anyway.
It was mentioned in [4] that unless the data regarding recovered cases and death are reliable
enough, the epidemiological models such as SIR, SIS and SIRD cannot be blamed. The
population exposed to the disease may not have economic homogeneity, and in that situation the
SEIR model similarly cannot be blamed for unacceptable results.
It is known that patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting
infected with the SARS CoV-2 as they have the worst prognosis (see for example [8]). In Assam,
it has been reported that the number of deaths due to SARS CoV-2 does not include death of
corona patients with comorbidity after recovery as death due to the corona virus disease. Indeed
this might actually have been the followed norms elsewhere also the world over. This in turn
shall make the projections using the standard epidemiological models faulty.
Further, in a region with high population density, how well the people are maintaining social
distance is an important point. Indeed, due to parameters associated with poverty, maintaining
social distance cannot be homogeneous anyway. Finally, although at the initial stage medical
facilities were more readily available to the corona patients, currently due to the high spread of
the disease, medical facilities are getting reduced. This might end up affecting the recoveries.
We shall in this article analyze the data of the spread of the virus in Assam assuming that the
spread pattern is a function of time only. We shall not study the situation using any standard
epidemiological model. We shall first see whether the cumulative total number of cases is
following the exponential pattern at least approximately. Thereafter we shall see if forecasts can
be made regarding the total number of cases in Assam.
The Data
We have already mentioned that the data regarding the total number of COVID-19 cases are
readily available on the web by the name COVID-19 Pandemic in Assam, from March 31 to
August 19. We are now going to display the data from August 20 onwards collected on a daily
basis from the portal Assam COVID-19 Dashboard, Government of Assam. These data tally with
the Worldometers.info data displayed from 16 August onwards. We are interested to display the
data from August 20 to September 14 because the Assam Government Portal gets updated every
single day, and on any day the data for that day only can be easily seen. We have actually
analyzed the data from August 22 to September 10. The data for the four days thereafter would
be of help to compare the forecasts with the actual values.

From the figure above, we can surmise that the growth pattern is perhaps exponential.
The Analysis
We first hypothesize that the cumulative total number of cases in Assam is following an
exponential pattern. To test the acceptability of this hypothesis we shall proceed as follows. We
shall test whether the function

fits the data of spread in Assam approximately, where  stands for the cumulative total
number of cases on day t, and a and b are parameters to be estimated. Let   
. Now
if the estimated linear equation defining  can be found to be statistically acceptable, that
would mean that there should be no reason to reject our hypothesis stated above.


Before testing for acceptability of the hypothesis, we would like to have a look at whether the
values of âˆ†, the first order differences of , are showing a reducing trend. Let us write
âˆ†   . If the estimate of  comes out to be negative, then we would test the
acceptability of the fitted regression equation of âˆ† on . If the equation is found to be
statistically acceptable, then it can be used for forecasting. In that kind of a case, testing for
validity of equation (1) would not be necessary. However, if the equation is found to be
rejectable, or if the estimated value of the parameter  is found to be positive, then we would go
for testing the validity of equation (1) statistically so that it can be used for forecasting.
Indeed, although in the applications of the epidemiological models it is assumed that in the
second stage of the spread the pattern is exponential, it can only be approximately exponential
and not absolutely exponential because that would mean that the epidemic would never end.
Now in the approximately exponential stage, the parameter b in (1) above cannot actually remain
constant for a long period, it has to have a decreasing trend.
At this point, we would like to mention that in the case of the World outside China, it was seen in
[9] that during the period of the study, the average values of âˆ† had followed the following
pattern:
(A) 0.13705 from March 21 to March 28,
(B) 0.09287 from March 29 to April 4,
(C) 0.05916 from April 5 to April 11,
(D) 0.04078 from April 12 to April 18, and
(E) 0.03181 from April 19 to April 25.
What we mean is that the parameter b in (1) was seen to have a decreasing trend. It was
mentioned in [4] that the average value of âˆ† in India during the 14 days from May 11 to May
24 was 0.051716. It was seen further that during the 7 days from May 25 to May 31, the average
value of âˆ† was 0.045584. The average value of âˆ† in India [4] from June 1 to June 7,
2020, was 0.04063. From June 8 to June 10, the average came down to 0.03635. Therefore the
reducing trend of âˆ† in the approximately exponential stage of the outbreak was actually
observed.
In the following table, we are going to show the values of âˆ† for Assam for the duration of 20
days from August 22 to September 10.

From Fig. 2 it can be surmised that perhaps the values of âˆ† are not showing a reducing trend.
Indeed, the regression equation of âˆ† on  was found to be
âˆ†  0.021481  0.000025318 
(2)
As the estimate of  has been found to be positive (= 0.000025318), we can say that during the
period from August 22 to September 10 the variable âˆ† has actually shown an increasing
trend. We would have gone for a statistical test of validity of this equation had the estimate of 
been negative. But as surmised, the estimate has come out to be positive, and therefore testing
for validity of this equation statistically is of not much use.
What we have found is very alarming. As was discussed earlier, âˆ† should show a decreasing
trend, which asserts that the cumulative total number of cases is indeed following an almost
exponential pattern of growth and also that the pattern would in course of time change towards
an almost logarithmic pattern as happens in the cases of epidemics. However in Assam during
the period of those 20 days, the cumulative total number of cases has not reflected a tendency
towards improvement. The estimate of  being positive points to this kind of a conclusion only.
We shall now have to see whether the spread pattern is actually of the exponential type or not. It
may be that the pattern is just highly nonlinear and is not nearly exponential yet.
We shall therefore move forward to examining whether equation (1) has validity during those 20
days. We shall therefore check whether the regression equation of  on ,      is
statistically valid. The regression equation fitted using the method of least squares was found to
be for   1, 2, â€¦ ,
  11.36947  0.02305 .

Using the Studentâ€™s t test, with

  = ! " 2# $1 " #  ,

where !  20, we have found that the calculated value of t comes out as equal to 78.089 which
is far greater than the two sided theoretical value of t (= 2.101), at 5% probability level of
significance for 18 degrees of freedom. We have indeed done the statistical test of the null
hypothesis % : '  0 against the two sided alternative hypothesis % : ' ( 0 where ' is the
population correlation coefficient between the variables âˆ† and t. Therefore we conclude that
during this period the null hypothesis is to be rejected, and that there is a significant linear
relationship between  and . Using equation (3) we have calculated the expected values of
. The diagrammatic representation has been shown in Fig. 3. In the figure, the first series
represents the observed values and the second series represents the expected values. From Fig. 3,
it can be seen that the expected values have started to slightly overestimate from 8 September
onwards. So if we make forecasts with the help of the regression equation (3), we may end up
overestimating the cumulative total number of cases. We have earlier tried to forecast the total
number of cases ([4], [9]) using the average value of âˆ† successfully. As âˆ† in the current
case has not shown a decreasing trend, we shall not go for forecasting with reference to âˆ†
because in that way also we shall end up making overestimating forecasts only. In Table-3 we
have shown the forecasts for 20 days starting from 11 September using equation (3).

It may be noted that in Italy, the epidemic appeared on February 15, and after just two and a half
months by the end of April the process of curve flattening had already started [10]. In India as a
whole also the epidemic appeared on February 15, and it is expected that the process of curve
flattening is about to start [4]. However, though in Assam the epidemic had started on March 31,
even now it is exponentially growing without showing any signs of retardation. It can be said
that the COVID-19 situations in India and in one of its States, Assam, are totally different. In
other words, the spread situations in India as a whole and in a small State of India are not really
comparable. It may so happen that in Assam the spread would continue to grow exponentially
even after the situation changes in India as a whole.
Conclusions
We have found that the COVID-19 situation in Assam, India, is very grim. The current pattern
followed by the cumulative total number of cases  is exponential of the type exp    .
But the parameter b is not showing a reducing trend yet, which is shown in all epidemiological
cases. Until the parameter b starts showing a reducing trend, nothing can be said when exactly
the epidemic would start peaking. In India as a whole, this reducing trend in b was found to have
started in the first half of May, and the spread in the country is still on the increase. In Assam, as
the reducing trend is yet to be seen, to what kind of a dangerous stage it would continue to spread
cannot be mathematically foreseen even now. In Italy for example, after two and a half months
from the start, the process of retardation had started. In Assam, even after five and a half months
from the start, the epidemic is still in an accelerating and unpredictable stage.
