Abstract
Background: Different levels of control measures were introduced to contain the
global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the
comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals
(pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health
authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees,
and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group.
Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including
incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated
release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19.
Methods and findings: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic
preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the
effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed
facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is
investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany,
and incarceration facilities in the U.S.
COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even
under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective
measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction
between the closed facility and the outside world – and will be most inefficient under
strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and
the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction
in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of
contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time
of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the
effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be
counterproductive in U.S. IFs.
Conclusions: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without
a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular

testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of
infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic
benefit needs to be assessed carefully.

Introduction

1

The global COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 was
declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO
Director-General in late January 2020 and drastically changed the way of living across
the globe [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious virus affecting the respiratory
system [2]. While most infections are asymptomatic and mild, severe infections are
life-threatening [3–6]. If the virus affects the lung it can result in diffuse pneumonia,
requiring oxygen supply, hospital, or even ICU treatment [7–11]. With no effective
treatment against the virus, severe episodes can result in death by multiple organ
failure [12]. Moreover, severe (and even mild) infections can cause substantial long-term
effects, potentially imposing long-term burdens on healthcare systems [13, 14]. From the
beginning of the pandemic, older adults and individuals with underlying medical
conditions, particularly lung or heart disease, diabetes, obesity, etc. are associated with
an increased risk of developing serious complications from SARS-CoV-2 infections [15].
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified people aged 65 years
and older and people living in a long-term care facility (LTCF) as high-risk groups.
Different control measures, were implemented by governments across the globe to
prevent the spread of the pandemic, including social distancing (cancellation of mass
gatherings and events, enforced physical distance, etc.), curfews, quarantine, and home
isolation measures, mandatory use of face masks, accompanied by massive deployment
of disinfectants, supply of contact tracking mobile-device applications, and diagnostic
tests [16–18]. Most commonly used are PCR tests that detect the virus in
nasopharyngeal swabs, diluted gargle samples, or peripheral blood. As PCR tests
amplify virus-specific RNA, they are characterized by very high specificity. The
sensitivity of such tests varies across different products on the market. Moreover, PCR
tests are easy to perform. Alternatives to quantitative PCR tests are
CRISPR-based [19, 20], which are rapidly performed, and have high specificity and
sensitivity. Other tests are antibody or antigen based. Such tests are less specific and
do not necessarily detect active infections, since antibodies and antigens are present in
the blood serum after the infection is cured.
The WHO established guidelines – including regular testing of employees and
residents – to protect individuals in LTCFs [21, 22] due to high case fatality rates [23].
In fact, every second COVID-19 related death occurred within LTCFs in Belgium,
France, Germany and Sweden [24, 25]. The situation was similar in other countries in
the European Union, in which 37-66% of all COVID-19 related deaths occurred inside
LTCFs [25]. The highest percentage of 66% was reported in Spain [25]. In absolute
numbers, by May 2020, e.g., 14 000 residents and over 40 000 LTCF staff have been
infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in France, while 8 935 staff have been infected [25].
In the U.K. and Scotland, respectively, 6% and 47% of all COVID-19 related deaths
occurred inside LTCFs [25]. In the U.S. 39% of COVID-19 related deaths occurred
among LTCF residents and staff [26]. Here, LTCFs refer to facilities/institutions, in
which residents with difficulties living independently stay for long periods. They are
cared for by staff members who do not necessarily reside in these facilities but live
outside and interact with the general public. They subsume facilities such as retirement
homes, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and residential care
facilities [25]. A large number of these residents suffer from chronic medical conditions
related to aging or have different impairments. Moreover, such facilities also subsume

incarceration facilities (IF). Namely, residents are also confined to the facility, share risk
factors, and they interact with staff (e.g., prison guards) that live outside the facility
and interact freely with the outside world. However, the contact behavior in IFs will be
very different from that in, e.g., nursing homes (see also Discussion). In the following we
use the terms LTCF and IF to refer to stereotypical nursing homes or prisons. The
reader should keep in mind that both terms can be used interchangeably when referring
to the institutional structure, but not when referring to the contact behavior.
Residents of LTCFs constitute a substantial group in high-income countries such as
Germany. With a population of 82.79 million, the number of people depending on
nursing either in LTCFs or at home in Germany increased from 2.5 million in 2011 to
3.41 million in 2017 (over 66% of them being over 90 years old) [27]. The capacity of
LTCFs in Germany was 952 367 beds (full stationary capacity: 885 488) in 2017, with
743 120 beds (723 451 full stationary) filled (623 182 beds in 2011, 612 183 being full
stationary) [27]. These are sustained by 764 648 employees, 64% of which are care and
support personnel [27]. These numbers have an increasing trend: there were additional
ambulant care services supported by 829 958 people in need of nursing with 390 322
employees [27].
Residents in IFs also do not interact freely with the general community and are
overseen by staff members, who do not permanently reside in these facilities. IFs face
challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19 [28, 29], and put elderly at particular
risk of severe infection [30]. Indeed, jurisdictions in the U.S. have accelerated the release
of low-risk offenders [31] as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. An estimated number of
6.4 million individuals were held under the supervision of the U.S. adult correctional
system in 2018 (including probation and parole), with an incarcerated population of
approximately 1.4 million [32–34]. There is a notable increase in the age structure of
state prisoners, in which the numbers of inmates older than 55, 60, and 65 years of age
have quadrupled from 1993 to 2003 [35]. Notably, COVID-19 rates in U.S. prisons are
four times higher than in the general population with about 20% of inmates having
being tested positive by December 2020 [36]. Residents in IFs share several risk factors
with LTCFs such as underlying health problems, psychological isolation etc. E.g. in the
U.S. chronic health conditions are particularly prevalent compared to the general
population [37]. Apart from the similarities, the contact behavior and possibilities to
implement hygienic measures and physical distancing are very different in LTCFs and
IFs.
For both LTCFs and IFs the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and
visitors by diagnostic tests before entering the facility to protect the resident risk groups
was mentioned in guidelines by public health authorities [21, 22, 38, 39]. The effectiveness
of such interventions is unclear but can be predicted by mathematical models.
Here, a mathematical model, based on the freely available CovidSIM simulation tool,
is adapted to estimate the benefit of routine screening for COVID-19 infections of
employees in LTCFs and IFs by regular tests. The same model applies to both LTCFs
and IFs. However, parameters need to be chosen differently to adequately reflect the
typical contact behavior in both institutional types. Here, we focus on studying the
impact of (i) the frequency at which employees are tested, (ii) the processing time to
obtain test results, and (iii) the quality of the test in terms of sensitivity. While the
model is described verbally in the main text, a concise mathematical description can be
found in the S1 Appendix. The model is exemplified by parameters that reflect roughly
the situations of LTCFs in Germany and IFs in the U.S. These, countries were chosen
as examples because LTCFs and IFs are of particular importance in Germany and the
U.S., respectively. The model per se is applicable to other industrial nations and other
closed facilities.

We study the impact of testing employees in LTCFs or IFs to protect resident risk
groups from COVID-19 infections using an extended SEIR model, i.e., by a
deterministic compartmental model of ordinary differential equations. In particular, the
model is an extension of that underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSIM [40].
The flow chart of the model is presented in Fig 1. The model is described verbally with
the concise mathematical description found in S1 Appendix. For the sake of simplicity,
in the description, we focus on LTCFs. The model is equally applicable to IFs, because
the structure of the model remains unchanged. Only the model parameters need to be
tailored to the specific type of institution.
A population of size N is divided into three groups: (i) the resident risk group (Ri),
i.e., residents of LTCFs, (ii) the employees (staff) working in LTCFs (St), who are in
close contact with the risk group, (iii) and the general population (Ge), i.e., the rest of
the population.
Each group (Ge, St, Ri), is further subdivided into susceptible, infected, recovered,
or dead individuals. Infected individuals pass through: (i) a latency period (not yet
infective), (ii) a prodromal period (already partly infective but not yet exhibiting
characteristic symptoms), (iii) a fully infectious period (symptoms ranging from
non-existent or mild to severe), and (iv) a late infectious period (no longer fully
infectious). All individuals either recover from COVID-19 and obtain full permanent
immunity or die. The model follows the change of the number of individuals, per unit
time, being in the susceptible (S), latent (L), prodromal (P ), fully infectious (I), and
late infectious (L) periods, and in the final recovered (R) and dead (D) stages separately
for the three population subgroups (Ge, St, Ri). Deaths unrelated to COVID-19 are
ignored, as we assume a pandemic in a large population in a relatively short time period.
In classical SEIR models, individuals in the latent, prodromal, infected, and late
infected classes simply proceed from one stage to the next at a rate directly related to
the residence time in each stage. This simplistic flow implicitly assumes that the times
individuals spend in the various compartments are exponentially-distributed, and hence
have a large variance. In particular, a proportion of individuals progresses too fast,
whereas others progress much too slow.
To resolve this, we subdivide the latent, prodromal, fully infectious, and late
infectious periods into several sub-stages, through which individuals pass successively.
This ultimately leads to more realistic durations and hence dynamics.
The characteristics of the population subgroups (Ge, St, Ri) are incorporated within
the contact behavior. Namely, the risk group has mainly contacts with other individuals
in the risk group and the LTCF employees, whereas their contacts with the general
population are limited. The employees (St) have contacts among themselves, with the
risk group and the general population. However, the general population has mainly
contacts among themselves. Given a contact within or between certain sub-populations,
the contact occurs at random. The contact behavior is captured by the contact matrix
(see S1 Appendix section “The basic reproduction number and the next generation
matrix”).
Susceptible individuals acquire infections through contacts with individuals in the
prodromal, the fully infectious, or the late infectious periods at rates βP , βI , βL ,
respectively, which are identical for each subgroup.
The basic reproduction number R0 is the average number of infections caused by an
average infected individual in a completely susceptible population during the infectious
period. In a subdivided population (here Ge, St, Ri), the definition of R0 is not
straightforward and has to be derived from the next-generation matrix [41] (see S1
Appendix section “The basic reproduction number and the next generation matrix”).
Importantly, R0 fluctuates seasonally with a yearly average basic reproduction number

of R̄0 . Seasonal fluctuations in R0 are motivated by fluctuations in the intensity of UV
radiation, temperature, and time spent inside closed rooms [42], and intuitively
supported by the spike of COVID-19 infections in European counties in fall/winter 2020.

First, infected individuals are latent carriers, before they enter the prodromal period,
in which they become partly infective. From there, they enter the fully infectious period,
at the beginning of which, it is determined whether the infection proceeds as
symptomatic or asymptomatic. The likelihood to suffer from a symptomatic episode is
elevated in the risk group (Ri).
Covid-19 confirmed individuals are subject to case isolation. Specifically, a fraction
of symptomatic individuals will be detected and isolated in quarantine wards (perfect
isolation preventing all contacts). If the wards are full, infected individuals are sent into
home isolation (imperfect isolation, preventing only a fraction of contacts). Regarding
this, there are differences in the subgroups: each symptomatic individual in the risk
group will be detected and isolated in quarantine inside the LTCF (perfect isolation),
whereas only a fraction of the general population and the LTCF employees will be
isolated. Infected individuals further progress to the late infectious stage, during which
they will stay quarantined as determined during the fully infectious stage. Importantly,
LTCF employees will be tested for COVID-19 on a regular basis. We assume that the
test is 100% specific, i.e., there are no false-positive test results, reflecting PCR- or
CRISPR-based tests [19, 20]. If tested positive, they will be isolated either in quarantine
wards or at home, in which case all contacts with the risk group are prevented. Staff can
be tested positive during any of the infected stages (latent, prodromal, fully infectious,
late infectious), however with different sensitivity depending on the characteristic of the
COVID-19 test being used, irrespective of symptoms. In particular, there is a possibility
(depending on the sensitivity of the COVID-19 test) that employees are isolated already
during the latent period before they are infectious. Test results are not obtained
instantaneously, but with a time delay. Infected staff can still infect others during this
time. The waiting time for the test results depends on the available infrastructure.
Finally, late infected individuals, either recover or die. Only symptomatic infections
can cause death. The fraction of lethal infections is higher in the risk group.
All case isolation mechanisms are not initially present, but implemented with a time
delay after the initial occurrence of the disease. In addition to case isolation, general
contact reduction interventions, e.g., social distancing, curfews, etc. will be sustained in
a time-dependent fashion, reflecting lock-downs and other contact-reducing
interventions. Importantly, contact reduction does not affect all individuals in the same
way. Contacts within and between the population sub-groups are affected differently,
reflecting the specific kind of reductions being implemented. During the time interval in
which case isolation measures are sustained, contacts between the risk group and the
general population are reduced, reflecting preventative measure. Furthermore, visitors
have to provide a negative test result before entering the LTCF. To obtain conservative
estimations the latter intervention is ignored in the simulations.

The effect of protecting a resident risk group (LTCF residents) by regularly testing
LTCF employees, who are the most likely to import the disease into the facility, is
studied. The focus is mainly on PCR tests, but highly sensitive antigen tests are also
assumed. Model parameters are adjusted to roughly reflect the situation in the Federal
Republic of Germany, one of the countries that has successfully intervened in the
COVID-19 epidemic. The model itself is applicable to any industrial nation with an
aging population. The aim is to investigate the effects of protecting the risk group and
to estimate the demand for (PCR) tests. Some testing scenarios are not feasible in
terms of logistics and available testing capacities and just serve as a comparison.
We also apply the model to IFs, by parameterizing it to reflect roughly the situation
of U.S. prisons. We treat the case of LTCFs first, and present the case of IFs as a
comparison.
The parameters used for Germany are listed in Table 1, and S1 Table-S6 Table.
Germany has a population of roughly N = 83 million. We assume, 700 000 elderly
individuals live in LTCFs in which control interventions by PCR testing can be
implemented. All employees of LTCFs amount to approximately 760 000. This number
however includes employees in the administration and external services, who are not
regularly working in these facilities. Hence, a number of 500 000 employees was assumed
to work regularly in the LTCFs. The first COVID-19 cases were introduced in the
middle of February 2020, corresponding to time t = 0. A seasonal average basic
reproduction number of R̄0 = 3.4 was assumed, which fluctuated seasonally by 43% over
the year, with a peak roughly in late December (tR0max = 300). In Germany estimates
for R0 varied substantially, with 4.43 (95% CI 1.83–7.92) in March 2020 [44]. Here R0
was chosen to yield realistic dynamics under the contact reductions imposed in
Germany. Additionally, the average duration of the latent, prodromal, fully infectious
and late infectious stages were assumed to last on average DE = 3.7, DP = 1, DI = 5,
DL = 5 days, respectively. In the prodromal and late infectious stages, individuals were
assumed to be half as infective as in the fully infectious stage. Individuals in the risk
(Ri)
group were more likely to develop severe symptoms (fSick = 58% vs. fSick = 60%) and
(Ri)
had an increased mortality (fDead = 1.6% vs. fDead = 20%). The effect of restricting
LTCF access to members of the general population that provide a negative COVID-19
test result upon entry is ignored in the simulations.
General contact reduction was chosen intuitively to reflect approximately the
interventions imposed in Germany over time. The reductions were chosen such that the
overall observed disease prevalence (accounting for undetected infections) was accurately
reflected until February 2021. An additional “hard lockdown” was assumed to be
extended until April 2021 followed by a “soft lockdown” until summer 2021 (t = 450).
After that we assumed no contact reductions within the general population, and the
general population and the LTCF staff for three reasons: (i) with the ongoing
vaccination campaigns, compliance with contact reductions might be low after summer
2021; (ii) this allows us to study the impact of the intervention during different waves
(and is informative about what could have been achieved in the past and what can be
achieved in the future); and (iii) we want to illustrate what happens in a well-managed
epidemic vs. an ill-managed epidemic without strong contact reductions. The latter
reflects a strategy aiming for herd immunity, i.e., no interventions in the majority of the
population, while protecting only risk groups. For comparison we also assumed a more
radical herd-immunity scenario with no general contact reductions in the whole

population after t = 450 and protecting the risk group just by regular testing of staff. In
any of the scenarios the epidemic has three waves with three peaks: (i) the initial wave
in April 2020, (ii) the second wave that started in late September 2020 and peaked in
December 2020, and (iii) a hypothetical third massive peak in late October 2021
corresponding to a herd-immunity strategy – this scenario is intentionally unrealistic.
Clearly, the available capacities of tests, the infrastructure to perform tests, the
waiting time for results, and the sensitivity of tests can vary substantially. The impact
of these factors is investigated. In any case, testing hardly affects the general
population, while it has an effect which can be profound on the risk group or even the
staff (see Figs 2-8). Typically, low sensitivity of tests can be compensated by testing
more frequently to reduce the number of infections in the risk group as illustrated below
by comparing PCR with antigen tests (see also Figs 8, 9). The effects of various aspects
of the testing intervention are explained below. Importantly, testing interventions are
assumed from the onset of the epidemic to study the hypothetical effect that could have
been achieved by screening LTCF staff.

Assuming a baseline “good quality” PCR test with a processing time of 48 hours, the
intervention has a profound effect on the number of infections and deaths in the risk
group as long as the number of infections is not too high (see Figs 2, 3), reducing the
number of infections at the epidemic peak in the second wave by about 35% (see Fig 2E)
and the number of deaths by a similar percentage (see Fig 3E). Testing daily would lead
up to a 55% reduction. This is not true for the first wave, because initial infections were
mainly introduced from outside the LTCF before general contact reduction and case
isolation were implemented. During the first wave testing is much less effective. During
the third peak (Figs 2F, 3F), even daily testing leads only to a relative insignificant
reduction of infections. However, the reduction in mortality is still noticeable and about
11% for testing every 5 days. Testing is slightly more efficient in relative (but not in
absolute) terms if no general contact reduction is assumed at all (Figs 2H, 3H).
The results for the staff are similar to those for the risk group in the first and second
wave, however, the reduction in the number of infections (Fig 2C, D) and (particularly)
deaths (Fig 3C, D) are less pronounced. The epidemic peak in the second wave is
reduced by 30% when testing every 5 days (cf. Fig 2C with E). Testing daily would lead
up to a 45% (cf. Fig 2C with E). Importantly the number of infections is higher in the
third wave – the higher the testing rate, the higher the increase in the number of
infections (see Fig 2D). The reason is as follows. Initially less individuals are infected,
leading to a larger susceptible population, such that the momentum of the third peak as
R0 increases due to seasonal fluctuations is higher, leading to a stronger exponential
growth in the number of infections. In fact, the third peak is higher than in the case
without testing. However, mortality is still slightly reduced (Fig 3D). For daily testing
the third peak is almost as high, as if neither tests were performed, nor contact
reductions sustained after time t = 450.
The general population is hardly affected by testing the LTCF staff. The number of
infections are slightly lower in the second wave, for which the intervention is most
successful. The third peak increases with increasing testing rate for the same reasons as
for the LTCF staff (Fig 2A, B). Overall mortality is not noticeably affected (Fig 3A, B).
Notably, the number of infections per 100 000 is largest in the general population
and smallest in the risk group. Cases, however, are easier to detect in the risk group,
because the fraction of symptomatic cases is higher. Mortality per 100 000 individuals is
much higher in the risk group than in the general population and among LTCF staff.

Fig 2. Impact of rate of testing LTCF staff on the number of infections: Shown are the numbers of infected (I)
individuals per 100 000 individuals (normalized to the sub-population size) at time t for (A-B) the general sub-population
(Ge), (C-D) the LTCF staff (St), and (E-F) the risk group (Ri), assuming different testing rates. A good-quality test (cf.
Table 1) is assumed with a processing time of 48 hours. After generation t = 450 no contact reductions among Ge, and
between Ge and St are assumed. Only contact reductions within LTCFs are assumed. The solid black lines correspond to the
baseline model without the testing intervention. The dashed black lines show the number of infections if neither testing nor
any general contact reductions is assumed after generation t = 450. Panels G, H show the number of infections for
corresponding simulations assuming no contact reduction in the LTCFs after time t = 450 – the solid black line corresponds
to no testing. Panels A, C, E, G show the dynamics for the time range from t = 0 to t = 550, while the remaining panels show
the dynamics for the time range from t = 300 to t = 750 (note the difference in the range of the y-axes for the different time
ranges). Seasonal fluctuations in R0 are assumed and are indicated by the dashed grey lines corresponding to the axis on the
right-hand side in all panels. The parameters used for the simulations are listed in Tables 1, and S1 Table-S6 Table.

Test-processing time

296

The time needed to process PCR tests, reflecting the testing infrastructure, has a
similar effect as the testing rate (see Subsection Testing rate) during the first two waves,
assuming weekly testing with a good-quality PCR test every 5 days (see Figs 4, 5).
When comparing test-processing times of 0.5-4 days (12, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours), shorter
ones lead to a noticeable reduction in the number of infections, particularly there is a
noticeable gain when shortening the processing time from 48 to 24 hours. Unlike for the
testing rate, the test processing time leads to a reduction in the third peak for the
following reason: the momentum of third wave is not captured completely because the
number of susceptibles was sufficiently reduced as the processing time is not as relevant
in reducing incidence as the testing rate.
The effect of the processing time is similar in the LTCF staff population, but less
pronounced as in the risk group. The general population is again hardly affected.

different test processing times assuming a testing rate of once per 5 days with a good-quality test (cf. Table 1).

Test sensitivity

309

The sensitivity of the tests, which varies between the stages of the infection, impacts the
number of infections and deaths in the risk group and staff (Fig 6, 7). The effects are
similar to those of the testing rate and processing time (see Subsections Testing rate,
Test-processing time). Testing every 5 days with a test processing time of 48 hours was
assumed. For simplicity, we compared only tests, which had higher or lower sensitivity
across all stages of the infection as specified in Table 1. During the second wave,
improving the quality of the test from poor (failure to detect the virus during the latent
phase, with a maximum sensitivity of 65%) to intermediate (maximum sensitivity of
75%) yields a 30% instead of a 25% reduction in the number of infections in the risk
group. A good-quality test (maximum sensitivity 80%), yields a 35% improvement. The
effect of increasing sensitivity eventually saturates. The relative reduction of infections
in the third peak is not pronounced.
Similar results hold for the staff, however, the number of infections increases with
test quality during the third wave, for the same reason as higher testing rates lead to a
higher peak. The general population is hardly impacted – a slight effect is mainly
noticeable during the second wave (Fig 6A).

Antigen tests

326

In the model false positive tests are ignored, reflecting high specificity. While originally
only PCR tests had such quality, antigen tests have been substantially improved [45–50].
While PCR tests need to be processed in a lab, their antigen-based counterparts are
available as rapid tests that return the test result after 5-20 minutes. Moreover, it is
feasible to perform them more frequently. However, antigen tests are less sensitive
particularly in the early stages of the infection (but might be more sensitive in the late
stages). As a comparison we investigated the impact of an antigen rapid test, specified
in Table 1, that is performed either every day or twice per day and returns the result
within 15 minutes with an excellent-quality PCR test that is performed every 5 days
and returns the result within 48 hours. The results are shown in Figs 8 and 9.
The antigen test leads to a substantially stronger reduction in the number of
infections and mortality in the risk group and among the LTCF staff. The effect in the
general population is negligible. During the second wave antigen tests reduce the height
of the peak by about 55% whereas PCR testing leads only to a reduction of
approximately 40% (Fig 8E). The reduction during the third wave is smaller in relative
terms, but the improvement compared with PCR-testing is still substantial (Fig 8F).
The improvement of testing twice per day with antigen tests compared with daily
testing is not pronounced. Overall the effect of reducing mortality during the second
and third wave in the risk group and among LTCF staff is substantial (Figs 9C-F).
The epidemic peak in the third wave is slightly higher in the staff population if
antigen rather than PCR tests are used (Fig 8D).

Economic considerations

348

Moral obligations set aside, the economic gain of the testing interventions can be
derived from the results described above. Such considerations must incorporate testing
capacities and the available infrastructure. From the simulations one can make an
economic assessment of the costs of the intervention either from the onset of the
pandemic or prospectively.
Treatment costs for an LTCF resident in Germany for respiratory diseases such as
COVID-19 and other flu-like symptoms (compared in [51]) can be roughly estimated to
range between 4 000-8 000 Euro from the official statistical reports on national
healthcare costs [52]. Namely, as the influenza and pneumonia costs from men and
women over 65 years of age in Germany in 2015 (1.41 billion Euro; cf. [52], section 4.3.5)
divided by the number of full stationary influenza and pneumonia cases in hospitals and
rehabilitation centers in the same age cohort (225 403; cf. [52] section 4.1.1 and 4.1.3).
These estimates are in accordance with those for in-patient flu costs reported in [53].
Notably, the costs can only be a rough estimate, that does not include healthcare costs
for resulting chronic respiratory conditions (which are a substantial fraction of the total
healthcare costs).
According to the simulations roughly 256 000 LTCF residents will become
symptomatically infected with the virus without the testing intervention (cf. Fig 8F).
This number reduces to roughly 224 300 with PCR testing every 5 days. This results in
savings of treatment costs of 126-251 million Euro. Assuming costs of approximately 40
Euro per PCR test, and testing once per working week (5 days; 48 weeks per year) over
the whole duration amounts to 1.96 billion Euro. This assumes regular testing from the
beginning of the pandemic. Hence, the costs for testing are an order of magnitude
higher than the gain. Testing every working day (5 times per week; 48 weeks per year)
with antigen test at a cost of 5 Euro per piece over the whole duration of the simulation
is considerably cheaper at a cost of 1.24 billion Euro. However, the savings due to the
reduction in the number of severe infections are considerably higher at a cost of 219-437
million Euro.
These calculations assume testing from the onset of the pandemic. One can also
infer the future savings in healthcare costs. Between generation (t = 350) and the end
of the simulation (t = 750), the PCR testing strategy would save 87-173 million Euro as
opposed to 1.04 billion Euros in costs for tests. The costs for antigen tests would
amount to 650 million Euro, while the savings add up to 162-325 million Euro.
These numbers are less discouraging than they appear at first sight. Namely, testing
needs to be performed only in phases with high incidence, reducing the costs for tests
substantially. Furthermore, the third wave is a hypothetical scenario that mocks a
herd-immunity scenario that is unlikely to be politically sustainable. In practice, general
contact reduction will reduce incidence and render testing more efficient. In addition,
test quality is steadily improving. In any case, the considerations here serve just as an
idea. The model should be fine tuned to specific situations of interest and more refined
costs should be considered. Importantly, the considerations here focused on quantifiable
aspects and did not include any moral obligations or long-term costs of infections (some

Incarceration facilities

392

The predictive model also applies to incarceration facilities (IFs). While, the basic setup
is the same, demographic numbers, risk factors, contact behavior, and – importantly –
the possibilities to implement protective measures are very different. Here we illustrate,
how the model can be hypothetically adapted to U.S. prisons. As for German LTCFs
we chose parameters that roughly reflect the observed number of infections over time
(accounting for undetected cases). Accurate estimations, would require reliable
estimates of the contact-behavior in IFs. This requires in-depth knowledge that is
beyond the scope of this article.
Model parameters are listed in Table 1, and S1 Table-S5 Table, and S7 Table. The
U.S. has a population of approximately N = 331 million, of which 1.4 million are
incarcerated (risk group) and guarded by 423 000 correctional officers [32, 33, 54].
The simulations start on January 20, 2020 (t = 0). A slightly smaller seasonal
average basic reproduction number than in Germany, namely R̄0 = 3.2, was assumed
(because of the lower population density). We further choose smaller seasonal
fluctuations (35%), due to the country’s lower latitude. The peak in R0 was again late
December (tR0max = 335). Parameters describing the disease were chosen as for
Germany. However, the fraction of the risk group to develop symptomatic infections
(Ri)
fSick = 43% (vs. fSick = 58%) was supposed to be lower than in the general population,
due to the demographics in the risk group. On the contrary, the fraction of lethal
symptomatic infections was assumed to be higher than in the general population
(Ri)
(fDead = 11% vs. fDead = 4%). This reflects, on the one hand, the overall younger
population in IFs, and, on the other hand, the high number of pre-existing conditions
and risk factors in the IF population.
Likewise for LTCFs, the choice of general contact reduction was intuitive to resemble
the observed number of infections. Contrary to LTCFs, contact reductions were
assumed to be more efficient in the general population than in IFs, where
contact-distancing measures are notoriously difficult to implement [55]. Moreover, there
might be a lack of compliance with distancing measures due to the behavioral patterns
in prison [56]. Overall, contact reductions were assumed to be weaker than in Germany,
reflecting the governments’ different approaches in managing the disease [57]. As for
Germany, no contact reduction between the general population was assumed after
summer 2021 (t = 450).
The epidemic in the U.S. follows four waves (Fig 10, and S1 Fig-S6 Fig): (i) the
initial wave in April 2020; (ii) the second wave in August 2020; (iii) the third wave in
the holiday season (starting with thanksgiving holiday); (iv) the hypothetical fourth
wave in autumn 2021 after contact reductions have been lifted (except those sustained
in the IFs).

The general population is less affected by testing staff than it was for LTCFs in
Germany for the following reasons: (i) the risk group and staff populations constitute a
smaller fraction of the population; (ii) the epidemic was/is stronger in the U.S., so
control interventions are less effective; (iii) the interactions of the risk group with the
general population is more restricted.
Differences between German LTCFs and U.S. IFs arise mainly from the differences
in contact behavior. More explicitly, residents in LTCFs have less contacts than the
remaining population and it is relatively easy to comply with distancing and hygienic
measures in such facilities. On the contrary, inmates in IFs have abundant close

contacts due to overcrowding. Consequently, it is not possible to implement distancing
and hygienic measures.
Testing significantly impacts the dynamics of the risk group and IF staff. There are
a number of similarities compared with Germany, but also substantial differences. As for
the case of LTCFs in Germany, the first wave of the epidemic is not noticeably changed
by testing, and a strong reduction in the number of infections occurs in the second wave,
due to the same mechanisms as described for Germany. The third wave in the U.S.
corresponds to the third wave in Germany. However, due to seasonal fluctuations in R0 ,
the exponential growth in the number of cases is much stronger during the third wave if
the number of infections was lower beforehand (during the second wave). While this
effect was relatively moderate in Germany LTCFs, it is substantial in U.S. IFs. Because
testing leads to much higher number of infections during the third wave, the susceptible
population is considerably reduced, such that the fourth wave is milder.
One difference compared with German LTCFs is that, the epidemic waves are less
“synchronized” between the risk group, the staff and the general population. In fact, the
number of infections within the staff and risk group are perfectly correlated, but
different from the general population. Namely, the first wave is less pronounced, and
blurs with the second wave, which is much more aggressive inside IFs. Indeed, the
number of cases per 100 000 individuals is three to four times higher for the risk group
and up to about two times higher for the IF staff (Fig 10, S1 Fig, S3 Fig, S5 Fig). The
same holds true for the third wave. The fourth wave, during which no contact
reductions are assumed in the general population, is by far the most substantial one in
the general population (Fig 10A, B). On the contrary, the third wave is much milder for
the IF staff, with an epidemic peak being about three times as high (Fig 10C, D). An
important observation is made for the risk group: the fourth wave is much milder than
the third wave and approximately as strong as the second one (Fig 10E, F). The reason
is that the extraordinary high number of infections in the risk group during the third
wave results in high levels of immunity.

Regarding testing, the testing rate has the most pronounced effects. The effects of the
testing rate in the first and seconds waves (S1 Fig-S2 Fig) is similar as in German
LTCFs. However, in the third wave the effect is much more pronounced, while the effect
in the fourth wave is again similar to the one in Germany’s third wave. The second and
third waves in the U.S. correspond to ‘controlled’ epidemic peaks and is equivalent to
the second wave in Germany. Importantly, testing in IFs leads to a much higher number
of infections during the third wave due to the arguments outlined above. Hence, when
considering the second and third wave as one compound, testing has undesirable effects
for the risk group and staff due to the specific contact behavior in IFs. In particular,
from the end of the third wave, testing leads to higher mortality (S2 Fig), which,
however, changes in the short run. Importantly, in terms of mortality, the testing is
much less effective than in LTCFs in the long run.

Similarly as in German LTCFs, the effect of processing time (S3 Fig-S4 Fig) is less
pronounced than that of the testing rate. The effects are similar: increasing the
processing time has the same qualitative effect as increasing the testing rate.

Also the test quality impacts the dynamics similarly as in German LTCFs. Improving
the test quality (S5 Fig-S6 Fig) has a stronger effect than increasing the processing time.
As for German LTCFs this effect saturates.
Antigen tests in IFs

486
487
488

489

Overall, testing hardly leads to a reduction in mortality, neither in the risk group nor
among the IF staff. Testing more frequently with antigen tests, which has a beneficial
and economically meaningful effect, in German LTCFs, leads even to a slight increase in
mortality inside U.S. IFs (Fig 11F).
Economic considerations in IFs

490
491
492
493

494

The simulations suggest as supported by empirical evidence [56] that the contact
conditions in U.S. prisons render the risk group particularly vulnerable, and in fact
expose them to high risk of infection. Interventions such as testing, which per se can
have a beneficial effect (as for German LTCFs), can neither protect the risk group, nor
compensate the lack of possibilities to implement appropriate precautionary measures.
Economically, testing seems not to be cost-effective in U.S. IFs. The reason is that
mortality and the number of infections is not strongly reduced in the long run. In the
short run it causes even higher numbers of infections and mortality. Testing can only be
part of epidemic management that promotes strong contact reductions, which cannot be
realized in U.S. IFs due to overcrowding. Economic considerations must be part of
rethinking infrastructure and conditions in IFs.

Discussion

506

Elderly citizens and particularly residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) were
identified early as a vulnerable risk group that deserves particular protection, as
reflected by the WHO guidelines in March 2020 [21]. Regular testing of LTCF employees
and residents for COVID-19 was explicitly mentioned by the John Hopkins University
in their Guidance on Protecting Individuals Residing in Long-Term Care Facilities [22].
Furthermore, such recommendations can also be found in the WHO policy brief on
preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services from July 2020 [38].
To evaluate the effectiveness of testing interventions to protect resident risk groups
in LTCFs we extended the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim
(http://covidsim.eu; [40]). In particular, the deterministic model formulated as systems
of differential equations was extended to separate the risk group of LTCF residents and
the LTCF employees from the remaining population. Control interventions within the
LTCFs affecting the residents and employees roughly reflect the WHO
recommendations [38]. Besides, LTCF employees are regularly tested for COVID-19 and
isolated from the resident risk groups if the result is positive. In addition to these
control interventions general contact isolation measures (reducing effectively the number
of contacts of each individual) and case isolation measures (quarantine and home

isolation) were implemented more flexibly than in CovidSim. Importantly, general
contact reduction affects residents and employees in LTCFs differently than the
remaining population. Especially, general contact reduction measures between residents
of LTCFs are difficult to enforce.
In our investigations, the model was adjusted to reflect the situation in the Federal
Republic of Germany. However, the model is not restricted to one particular country
but will be applicable to any other industrialised nation with a similar age structure –
namely one for which age-dependent contact behaviors can be neglected (extending the
model to include age dependence is possible in principle). The model per se is not
restricted to the situation of LTCFs but applies similarly to other closed facilities. To
illustrate this, we parameterized the model to reflect the situation of incarceration
facilities (IF) in the United States of America. Inmates in U.S. prisons share several risk
factors with LTCF residents (pre-existing conditions etc.) and have an increasing
elderly population. U.S IFs are of particular interest since the number of COVID-19
within them was reported to be extremely high [56].
The results clearly indicate that regular COVID-19-screening of LTCF employees by
testing successfully reduces the number of cases and deaths in the resident risk group
and among LTCF employees. However, even with thorough testing a reduction of only
50% of cases can be achieved and only in combination with strong distancing measures
that control the epidemic in the overall population. Our results indicate that the
frequency at which employees are tested has a strong effect. Testing once every working
week, i.e., every 5 days with good quality PCR tests is less effective than testing daily
with good quality antigen rapid tests – testing more frequently would improve the
outcome but seems unrealistic. The waiting time for the return of test results (ranging
from 12 to 96 hours) has a less noticeable effect. A waiting time of 24-48 hours for PCR
tests and 15 minutes for antigen tests seems to be realistic. The quality of the test in
terms of sensitivity has a clear impact on the outcome. Here, PCR tests were assumed
to be relatively conservative, considering the fact that these tests are constantly
improved. Our simple rough estimates of the economic gain of the proposed
intervention, comparing the potential costs of COVID-19 treatments with the costs for
the testing intervention are less encouraging. However, these estimates are conservative
as they do not account for healthcare costs for long-term effects of the infection and
capacity shortages in the LTCFs, e.g., due to isolation measures of infected residents.
Notably, the estimated costs are more encouraging for antigen rapid tests. (Note that
the model is only applicable to highly specific antigen-tests for which false-positive
results can be ignored.) Moreover, antigen tests have a lower sensitivity in the early
stages of the infection, when antigen levels in the patient have not yet reached the
detection threshold, therefore more frequent testing is required. However, COVID-19
rapid tests are cost efficient, with approximate 3-10 Euro per test. With ongoing
vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups first, the economic considerations and the
effectiveness of testing intervention need to be reevaluated. Altogether, our results
clearly indicate that testing alone is insufficient to protect the risk group. In particular,
our results highlight the danger of the controversial strategies aiming for herd immunity,
while protecting only vulnerable risk groups as initially advocated by, e.g., the U.K.
government [58].
The proposed intervention considers regular testing only of LTCFs employees (staff)
not of residents. The reason is that we wanted to study the impact of minimal-invasive
control measure. Namely, the risk group is twice as large as the target population being
tested. Both, the additional costs and discomfort of testing for elderly people would be
substantial. Our model covers the additional requirement of visitors (from the general
population) to present negative COVID-19 tests upon entering LTCFs. This was
ignored in the simulations to obtain conservative predictions.

It should be noted that general contact reduction measures are modelled
time-dependently here. While our example assumed intuitive reductions that reflect the
imposed interventions at the beginning of the pandemic, we assumed rather naive
reductions for the future. In particular, no contact reductions after summer 2021 were
assumed in the general population. These assumptions were made to study the effect of
testing and the model behavior in an uncontrolled epidemic scenario. With ongoing
vaccination campaigns such a hypothetical scenario is too extreme. However, model
parameters can be adapted to reflect more realistic situations.
Besides a number of similarities, our simulations suggest that the implications of
testing staff are very different for U.S. IFs. This is mainly due to the difference in
nature of the contact behavior in U.S. IFs and German LTCFs. Particularly, U.S.
prisons are typically highly crowded and prisoners have many close contacts (in sleeping
areas, dining facilities, showers, etc.) [55, 56]. Precautionary measures such as
systematic use of filtering face-piece respirators (FFR) are impossible to enforce in an
efficient way. Namely, FFRs cannot be worn for more than 6-8 hours without proper
reprocessing [59, 60]. Therefore, unlike LTCF residents, incarcerated persons (i) have on
average more contacts that could potentially lead to disease transmission than the
general population, and (ii) are less protected by contact-reducing measures than the
general population. (Note, not every encounter between two individuals would qualify
as a “contact” in the model, because exposure time is too short.) Due to these facts the
epidemic leads to higher incidence in IFs than in the remaining population. Introducing
COVID-19 into an IF at the beginning of the epidemic is limited and might be
controllable. However, once COVID-19 spreads into the IF, it is impossible to contain
under crowded conditions. Hence, initially, incidence in IFs lacks behind that in the
general population and testing contributes to efficiently reduce the number of infections.
However, this preserves the susceptible population in IFs. Consequently, in the presence
of seasonal fluctuations in R0 , the epidemic can gain more momentum, leading to an
overall higher number of infections. Hence, testing is counterproductive. In fact, our
simulations suggest, that testing would have lead to an even higher number of infections
during the epidemic peak in the holiday season 2020. Moreover, our model suggests that
levels of immunity, which accumulated during the past epidemic peaks, are sufficiently
high to render future epidemic outbreaks less severe. Importantly, such implications
must be taken with caution, because the herd immunity argument as implied by the
model neglects mutations in the virus and assumes recovered individuals to be
permanently immune. However, immunity might be only temporal and even if it was
permanent, recovered individuals might be infected again with novel viral strains [61, 62].
The model predictions here are based on assumptions such as permanent immunity
after recovery from infections and assumes only one viral variant. The assumption of
immunity is appropriate for a short period of time (6 months to one year), but it is
unclear how restrictive this assumption is on the long run. Mutant variants such as the
British or South African variants are characterized by higher base reproductive
numbers [63]. This can be incorporated in the model approximately by increasing the
annual average base reproductive number in a sigmoidal fashion, synchronized with the
spread of these variants. However, this is not considered in the results presented here.
Moreover, the model does not consider vaccination campaigns. These already have a
substantial effect on mortality in LTCFs [64]. Including vaccination campaigns would
imply substantial model extensions that can be ascertained from the vaccination model
of [65].
Summarizing, the predictive model introduced here suggests that testing employees
in closed facilities is only efficient in combination with thorough epidemic management,
and particular contact reductions. The less controlled the epidemic, the less effective is
testing. As suggested by empirical evidence [55, 56], the contact behavior in U.S. prisons

hampers efficient implementation of preventative measures and indicates that the U.S
correctional system is/was not prepared for a global pandemic. Prioritizing IFs
residents during vaccination campaigns might relieve the critical situation in these
facilities, especially because of high numbers of preexisting healthcare conditions among
prisoners [37]. To refine predictions the readers are encouraged to use the accompanying
