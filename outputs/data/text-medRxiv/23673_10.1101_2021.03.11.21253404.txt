Abstract: We present a novel methodology for the stable rate estimation of
hospitalization and death related to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
using publicly available reports from various distinct communities. These rates are
then used to estimate underreported infections on the corresponding areas by
making use of reported daily hospitalizations and deaths. The impact of
underreporting infections on vaccination strategies is estimated under different
disease-transmission scenarios using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Removedlike (SEIR) epidemiological model.
One sentence Summary: Using a novel methodology, we estimate COVID-19
underreporting from public data, quantifying its impact on vaccination.

Underreporting cases of infectious diseases poses a major challenge in the analysis of their
epidemiological characteristics and dynamical aspects. Without accurate numerical estimates it
is difficult to precisely quantify the proportions of severe and critical cases, as well as the
mortality rate (1). Such estimates can be provided, e.g., by testing the presence of the virus.
However, during an ongoing epidemic, such tests’ implementation is a daunting task. Thus, this
work presents a methodology to estimate underreported infections based on approximations of
the stable rates of hospitalization and death. In order to find such rates, we seek specific time
periods when the daily rate of testing is sufficiently large with respect to the population size,
and the number of positive tests is small enough. During such periods we evaluate daily
empirical rates of hospitalization and death, looking for those whose rates fluctuate around some
mean value. This is performed by means of an accurate data analysis producing different
statistical indicators leading to the necessary correction. A schematic representation that
summarizes the proposed methodology can be found in Figure 1.
We use time series of seven-day moving averaged reports from Chicago and New York City
(NYC), in the US, the province of Buenos Aires (BA), in Argentina, and Mexico City (MC), in
Mexico.
Since COVID-19 severity strongly depends on age and gender (2–6), we evaluate the abovementioned rates accounting for demography to improve the estimation accuracy of the number
of infections. The latter will be called corrections. These corrections are evaluated using the
empirical rates of hospitalization and death as follows: For an observed rate of hospitalization
or death, and a given day in the time series, we evaluate the corresponding infection number.
For example, if for this day the reported hospitalization rate is one and the projected rate is one
half, then, the correction is twice the reported infections.
As an important byproduct, we evaluate the impact of underreporting in the designing of
vaccination strategies because the larger the number of unaccounted infections, the larger the
chances of vaccinating an already immune individual. This can restrict the capability of

vaccination in reducing hospitalizations and deaths, as simulated scenarios using a SusceptibleExposed-Infective-Removed-like (SEIR-like) model (7) show.

Figure 1: Methodological workflow for the underreporting quantification.

In order to estimate underreported infections, the formulas in Eq. (S.2) are used, considering
the daily cases of COVID-19. The graphical comparison between the observed and corrected
numbers of infections for Chicago can be found in Figure 2. Table 1 presents the corrected and
observed accumulated numbers of COVID-19 infections in Chicago, during the period 01Mar2020 to 23-Dec-2020. In order to observe the effect of corrections, we divided the period 01Mar-2020 to 23-Dec-2020 into three periods, namely, 01-Mar-2020 to 31-July-2020, 01Aug2020 to 05-Oct-2020, and 06-Oct-2020 to 23-Dec-2020.

Corrections using hospitalization rates present smaller values than the ones obtained with
death rates. This can be explained by the considerably larger values of the death rate in hospital
observed during the outbreaks of March to May and of October to November. The estimated
numbers for 01-Mar-2020 to 31-July-2020 are larger than the ones estimated for other periods,
indicating that underreport can be more likely in the beginning of the pandemic. Corrections
suggest that, for 01-Mar-2020 to 31-July-2020, the number of infections can be 32% to 632%
larger. For 01-Mar-2020 to 23-Dec-2020, COVID-19 infections can be 10% to 238% larger.
Thus, from 8% to 25% of the population of Chicago could have being infected in the study
period, instead of the observed proportion of 7.3%.

row uses the daily reports, the second uses daily reports by gender, and the third one uses daily
reports by age range. The filled envelopes are 90% confidence intervals (CIs).

The datasets from NYC do not have daily reports by age range or gender. We considered
two different periods to estimate the stable rates of hospitalization and deaths and corrected
infections can be found in Table S.3, representing 7.5% to 30% of the NYC population, instead
of the observed proportion of 4.41%.
For BA, unfortunately, during the period of study the percentage of positive tests was mostly
above 10%, making difficult the empirical analysis. However, we consider the period when the
positive rate was below 20%. Table S.4 presents the estimated rates of hospitalization and death.
Death rates for individuals younger than 60 years old are like the corresponding rates observed

in Chicago. However, for older individuals in BA, the death rates are considerably larger.
Corrections from Table S.5 suggest infection numbers varying from 3.4% to 303% larger than
the notified cases, representing 4.7% to 18% of the estimated BA population for 2020, instead
of the reported 4.53%.
For MC we could not identify a period when the rates of death or hospitalization stabilized
around mean values. Thus, we used the rates estimated for Chicago to provide corrections.
Using the death rates by age-range from Chicago seems to be the more accurate way to estimate
underreported cases in other places, since the data from Chicago satisfied the hypotheses made
to find stable rates. Corrections are 44% to 681% larger than the observed cases, representing
5.5% to 30% of the estimated population of MC for 2015.
Let us now turn to the impact of underreporting on the capacity of vaccination strategies in
reducing hospitalizations and deaths. We consider two different scenarios. In the first one,
simulations are performed under contained spread. In the second one, vaccination is
implemented under increasing transmission. The parameters used in these examples are
estimated using reports from Chicago and NYC (8).
In both cases we assume that the proportion of the population in the recovered, exposed or
in some infective compartment in the model in Eqs. (S.3)-(S.11), ranges from 5% to 30%.
Moreover, only the amount of 5% is observed in all cases. This means that the probability of
vaccinating someone that has already had contact with the virus is proportional to the percentage
of the population distributed in the exposed, non-hospitalized and infective, and recovered
compartments that were not included in the reports. Thus, in our simulations if 5% of the
population was infected, then 100% of the vaccinated individuals were susceptible, whereas, if
30% of the population was infected, then only 73.4% of the vaccinated individuals were
susceptible. We also assume that the vaccine is 90% effective, and 0.5% of the population is
vaccinated every day, for 150 days. The hospitalization rate also decreased proportionally to
the number of underreports.

Under contained spread, the transmission parameter amongst mildly infective individuals is
set to βM = 0.23. Under uncontained transmission, the parameter βM is set to 0.44. The resulting
accumulated numbers during the vaccination strategy, in both situations, can be found in Table
2.

The assumed size of this hypothetical population is of 2,693,976 individuals. In Table 2, the
numbers in the row Total Vaccinated correspond to the vaccinated individuals that were in the
susceptible compartment. As the underreported infections increase, the number of effectively
vaccinated individuals decreases. The recovered individuals are considered permanently
immune. The capacity of vaccination in reducing hospitalizations and deaths is hampered due
to underreporting, both under contained and uncontained disease spread. However, if the disease
transmission is not under control, then, as underreport increases, the number of hospitalizations

and deaths can decrease, indicating the achievement of herd immunity. Therefore, estimating
underreporting helps to quantify and explain possible limitations of vaccination strategies.
This work proposes possible ways to estimate underreported COVID-19 infections, based
on daily reported of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, considering demography. The proposed
methodology of correction is then applied to data from Chicago, NYC, BA, and MC. Moreover,
it estimates the potential impact of underreporting in vaccination strategies by using an SEIRlike model with parameters estimated from real data.
Estimating underreporting in an ongoing epidemic is a hard task, and only a seroprevalence
study can address this task appropriately. However, if we can estimate the stable rates of
hospitalization and death related to the disease, then we can use reports to estimate the correct
number of infections. The major difficulty of this approach is to identify the period when these
rates can be observed or approximated. Firstly, we assume that the number of tests performed
daily must be sufficiently large, then the number of positive tests must be sufficiently small.
Setting up this is subtle, and we must compare the data from different places. For Chicago and
NYC, we set that the rate of positive tests must be below 10% and for BA, it was 20%, since
we identified, in the corresponding periods, a stabilization of the rates around mean values. For
MC, we could not find such period.
For Chicago, NYC, and MC, during the period of study, corrections suggest that the number
of infected individuals could reach 30% of the population of these places, which represents, in
some cases, more than six times the reported numbers. Such estimates must be considered when
evaluating the aftermath of vaccination strategies, since underreporting, as illustrated by
numerical examples, can reduce the impact of vaccination in reducing mortality and
hospitalization rates. Estimating underreports can be useful, for example, to adjust the daily
numbers of given vaccines in order to reach the target of reducing the numbers of infections,
hospitalizations, and deaths.

Using age-dependent death rates seems to be a reliable way of estimating underreporting,
since such rates can be used even if the age pattern of the infected population changes during
the epidemic. Thus, we expect that the more demographic information we incorporate into the
death rates, the more reliable are the corrections.
In summary, using the methodology described in Figure 1 and employing a judiciously
chosen data analysis implementation, we estimate COVID-19 underreporting from publicly
available data. This leads to a powerful way of quantifying underreporting impact on the
efficacy of vaccination strategies.
