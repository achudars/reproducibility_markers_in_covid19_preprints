ryngeal swab. Currently, only qualitative RT-PCR assays are
available that yield positive/negative results without providing information about the viral load. Due to its complexity, RT-PCR
tests are performed in certified laboratories, are time consuming,
require experienced personnel, and can hardly lend themselves for
mass screening.3–6 Huge efforts are put in overcoming such a bottleneck thereby making nucleic acid amplification suitable for
Point Of Care tests, but the variety of methods7 and the lack of
any commercial solution demonstrates that the gap between research and real applications is still to be filled. 8 The main reason
for that has to be found in the detection principle (RNA-extraction, reverse transcription and amplification) whose complexity,
though greatly reduced by several approaches (e.g. Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or CRISPR-based detection) is far
from being used for quick POC tests.

ABSTRACT: Mass testing is fundamental to face the pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 discovered at the
end of 2019. To this aim, it is necessary to establish reliable, fast
and cheap tools to detect viral particles in biological material so to
identify the people capable to spread the infection. We demonstrate that a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticle
(AuNP) interaction induced by SARS-CoV-2 lends itself as an
outstanding tool for detecting viral particles in nasal and throat
swabs. The extinction spectrum of a colloidal solution of multiple
viral-target gold nanoparticles – AuNPs functionalized with antibodies targeting three surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelope and membrane) - is redshifted in few minutes when mixed
to a solution containing the viral particle. The optical density of
the mixed solution measured at 560 nm was compared to the
threshold cycle (Ct) of a Real Time-PCR (gold standard for detecting the presence of viruses) finding that the colorimetric method
is able to detect very low viral load with a detection limit approaching that of RT-PCR. Since the method is sensitive to the infecting viral particle rather than to its RNA, the achievements reported here open new perspective not only in the context of the
current and possible future pandemics, but also in microbiology as
the biosensor proves itself to be a powerful though simple tool for
measuring the viral particle concentration.

Lateral flow assays (LFA)s are among the actual biosensing
platforms for home tests and potentially for mass screening,9–12 but
the relatively poor sensitivity inherent to this technology13 makes
urgent the quest for a different approach.14 Biosensors based on
metal nanoparticles are often proposed because of their unique optical properties, which makes them potentially suitable to develop
easy-to-use and rapid colorimetric diagnostic tests for point-ofcare applications or even for home use.15 Due to its surface chemistry and given its biocompatibility gold is generally preferred to
other metals.16 The physical process underlying this class of
biosensors is the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)
that consists of coherent and non-propagating oscillations of free
electrons in metal nanoparticles arising when they interact with an
electromagnetic wave whose frequency resonates with the plasmonic one.17,18 Colorimetric detection based on gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) takes advantage of the color change occurring in a colloidal suspension from red to blue as a result of LSPR coupling
among the nanoparticles.19 AuNP aggregation can be regulated using biological mechanisms such as antigen-antibody (Ab) interac-

Since its identification in China in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2
epidemic has spread rapidly worldwide affecting millions of people, thus pushing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. Mass testing is fundamental to identify and isolate clusters in order to limit
and eventually eradicate SARS-CoV-2.1 The gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 infection is a reverse transcription real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)2 that is able to detect the
virus genetic material (RNA) in samples collected via nasopha-

Figure 1. (a) Sketch of the SARS-CoV-2 and functionalized AuNPs. SARS-CoV-2 proteins (spike, membrane and envelope) and
their corresponding antibody (S, E, and M) are highlighted in dark red, light violet and gray, respectively. The inset shows the pink
colloidal solution containing the anti-SARS-CoV-2 functionalized AuNPs (f-AuNPs). (b) The f-AuNPs surround the virion forming a
nanoparticle layer on its surface. Their interaction leads to a shift of the resonance peak in the extinction spectrum and, hence, to a
color change visible in the inset. (c) Extinction spectra reporting the OD of f-AuNP colloidal solution mixed with samples from patients with different viral load. At very low virion concentration (curve Ct32) the extinction spectrum is not distinguishable from the
spectrum of f-AuNPs (black continuous line). At intermediate virion concentration (curve C t15) the extinction spectrum is slightly redshifted and its difference with the “control” (f-AuNPs) produces the curve C t15-(f-AuNPs) that evidences the contribution entailed by
the virion. At high virion concentration (curve C t7), the extinction spectrum peaks at 560 nm as for C t15-(f-AuNPs). The agreement between the curve C7 and the simulated spectrum (gold continuous line, scaled to the experimental one) from a dielectric sphere (100 nm
diameter) surrounded by smaller AuNPs (20 nm diameter) confirms the interpretation of the extinction spectra as due to nanoparticle
aggregation.

porting Information (see sections S1-S5), that contains a scalable
procedure to realize the colloidal solution for COVID-19 test. In
this approach, the sample was a solution of Universal Transport
Medium (UTM, Copan Brescia, Italy), in which the specimen
was dipped after its collection from the patient and without any
additional treatment (see Supporting Information S6). Our test
was carried out by mixing 50 L of the f-AuNP colloidal solution
with 100 L of sample and 100 L of ultrapure water. The presence of the viral particles (virions) induced the formation of a
nanoparticle layer on its surface (Figure 1b) that led to a redshift
of the optical density (OD) in the extinction spectrum of the solution (Figure 1c). When the viral load was relatively high, i.e.

The Photochemical Immobilization Technique (PIT) is a surface
functionalization procedure that only requires UV activation of
the Abs and leads to a high density functionalized surface within
minutes.21,22 PIT has proven itself to be effective in tethering Abs
upright not only on flat surfaces, 23–26 but also on AuNPs, which
were used either to ballast small antigen 27 or to realize a colorimetric biosensor for detecting IgGs28 and estradiol.29 In the latter
cases, the presence of the antigen was detected as a change in the
absorbance that can be easily measured by a spectrophotometer or
even by naked eye. An approach relying on nanoparticle aggregation induced by the presence of the antigen was also used to detect
the influenza A virus, but no clinical application was reported to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the whole procedure in clinical
cases.30

C t <15 (Supporting Information S7), the color change from red
to purple was visible even by naked eye (Figure 1a-b).

The extinction spectrum of f-AuNPs reported in Figure 1c (black
continuous line) is not distinguishable from the spectrum of a
mixed solution with a sample having C t =32 (dashed light blue
curve, Ct32). On the contrary, red shift is observed for a sample
with C t =15 (blue continuous line, Ct15), which becomes much

Here, we report on the realization of a colorimetric biosensor that
can be used for COVID-19 mass testing with sensitivity and
specificity higher that 95% as demonstrated by a comparative
analysis carried out on a total of 94 samples (45 positive and 49
negative), tested by standard RT-PCR in the Virology Unit of
A.O.U. Federico II/Department of Translational Medicine of the
University of Naples “Federico II”. The detection scheme is
shown in Figure 1a and consists of a colloidal solution of PITfunctionalized AuNPs (f-AuNPs) against three surface proteins of

at a wavelength comparable to that exhibited by C t7 (approximately 560 nm).

To further confirm that the spectrum C t7 arose from f-AuNPs surrounding SARS-CoV-2, we simulated the virion as a 100 nm diameter31,32 dielectric sphere of 1.45 refractive index. 33 A change-

Figure 2. (a) Results of the colorimetric test on real thawed samples from 45 positive (red circle points) and 49 negative patients
(blue square points) previously tested by RT-PCR. For all of them the extinction coefficient was measured at 560 nm. The positive
samples (Ct ≤ 35) are identified in the plot by their RT-PCR cycle threshold (top scale), whereas the negative sample (C t > 35) are
simply numbered (bottom scale). The horizontal line at 0.252 extinction coefficient would lead to a test with 96% sensitivity and 98%
specificity. (b) ROC curve retrieved from the data of the panel (a). The area under the curve is 0.98. Also shown three threshold values
for the extinction coefficient that would provide the following sensitivity and specificity: 96% and 94% (0.241), 96% and 98%
(0.252), and 94% and 100% (0.263), respectively. (c) Picture of the 96 multiwell plate containing 250 μL of positive (top panel) and

able number of gold nanoparticles (20 nm diameter)34 was randomly positioned on the sphere (Supporting Information S8). We
implemented the “FDTD solutions” tool in Lumerical software
that provides numerical solutions of the Maxwell’s equations by
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method within a Mie problem-like workspace. A sketch of the simulation workspace is depicted in Figure S8.1a, whereas Figure S8.1b shows the LSPR
wavelength as a function of the number of AuNPs on the virion
surface. The plasmon resonance redshifts as the number N of
AuNPs onto the virion surface increases (Figure S8.1b). The maximum number of AuNPs that can be placed on a perfectly spherical surface with 100 nm diameter is N=80, but the steric hindrance
offered by surface proteins like the spike one surely limits the filling capacity of the virion surface. In fact, from Figure S8.1b we
see that the experimental value of LSPR=560 nm is achieved when
N=70, a value only slightly smaller than the maximum achievable.
The extinction spectrum corresponding to N=70 AuNPs (scaled to
the experimental one) is reported in Figure 1c (golden continuous
line) and shows a more than satisfactory agreement with the experimental one (red continuous line), thereby confirming that the
simple model proposed here is able to capture the essential physical processes underlying the virion detection.

colorimetric biosensor. In fact, with such a threshold we get 96%
and 98% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. This result is
even more remarkable if we consider that Ct>30 correspond to a
very low viral load for which the infection aptitude is questioned.
To this aim, it is important noticing that in the early phase of the
infection, high viral loads are detected by RT-PCR in upper respiratory specimens with low Ct readouts (Ct<20, with our assay). In
the late phase of the infection, a dramatic drop in viral loads is observed with higher Ct readouts (Ct>30 with our assay). Positive results with high Ct readouts pose a diagnostic challenge, since they
do not necessarily indicate active infection by a replicating virus.
It has been observed using viral culture that patients with high Ct
RT-PCR and protracted positivity are not infectious, suggesting
that the assay likely detects non active viral particles such as genetic material present in remnants of inactive virus 35 thereby making our approach of high diagnostic value.
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve from the data
shown in Figure 2a is reported in Figure 2b together with the indication of three threshold values, all of them leading to sensitivity
and specificity significantly higher than 90%. In particular, the
highest threshold value (0.263) leads to 100% specificity while
keeping the sensitivity at the remarkable value 94%. Overall, the
high performance of the test associated to the colorimetric biosensor is demonstrated by the area under the ROC curve whose value
is 0.98. The qualitative difference in the color between positives
and negatives can be observed in Figure 2c that shows a picture of
the multiwells containing the samples whose analysis is summarized in Figure 2a-b.

In order to test the validity of the colorimetric biosensor, we analyzed real samples previously examined by RT-PCR. The samples
were from 45 positive to SARS-CoV-2 patients for which Ct35
and 49 negative patients (Ct>35). For all of them, we measured
the optical density at 560 nm (OD560) by a commercial microplate
reader (Figure 2a). It is quite evident the correlation between the
Ct value (reported on the top scale) of the positives (red circles)
and OD560, whereas all the negatives (identified by a progressive
number in the bottom scale) are randomly distributed providing a

A value for n significantly smaller than 1 indicates the occurrence
of a negatively cooperative binding, a behavior which we expect
by considering that the probability a f-AuNP binds the virion reduces as the surface covering grows. While
simply

of the OD when no virions are present. It turns out that
previously measured thereby confirming the consistency of our description.
In conclusion, we realized a colorimetric biosensor based on a
colloidal solution of AuNPs (20 nm, OD1) each of them functionalized with Abs against one of the three surface proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 (spike, envelop and membrane). The ratio among
the three kinds of functionalized AuNPs was 1:1:1. Although both
the ratio and the size of AuNPs are still susceptible to optimization so to allow one to push even further the limit of detection, the
current performances of the biosensor would already permit its
use as a test for mass screening since the detection is based on the
interaction among the virions and the pAb-functionalized AuNPs
(single step detection) without any pretreatment (e.g. RNA extraction and amplification). The comparison of the readout of our
biosensor at 560 nm with the threshold cycle (Ct) of a RT-PCR
proved that viral loads corresponding to Ct=30 are detected by the
colorimetric biosensor. This threshold is of particular importance
because it corresponds a low viral load for which the infecting capacity is likely negligible.35 Such a good performance has to be
ascribed to a high filling ratio of the virion surface that results
from the presence of multiple Abs (three proteins are targeted)
and an effective AuNP surface functionalization procedure (PIT).
In fact, through PIT not only one Fab is always exposed so to
make AuNP highly “reactive”, but also the Abs are attached to the
surface (side-on position) without any linker (e.g. protein A), the
latter being detrimental for the plasmonic interactions among
AuNPs on which the colorimetric biosensor is based.

Figure 3. Optical density of the solution measured at 560
nm as a function of SARS-CoV-2 concentration (bottom
axis). The virion concentration was obtained by serial dilution
starting from a threshold cycle value Ct=7 (vertical dashed
blue line). Each decrease by a decade in virion concentration
(bottom axis) corresponds to an increase of the nominal Ct of
approximately 3.32 (top axis). The red continuous line is the
best fit of the experimental data by Hill equation. The uncertainty in the reading is taken as the resolution of the instrument and the error bar is within the data point.

nience, the top scale reports the equivalent Ct obtained by considering that 1:10 dilution corresponds to
change in
Ct, whereas the vertical dashed blue line identifies the starting
concentration. As it turns out, a detectable signal can be appreciated even after 7 serial dilutions (1:10 7) confirming the wide detection range resulting from the validation measurements reported
in Figure 1. In particular, from Figure 3 we can safely assess that
our limit of detection lies above Ct=30 thereby corroborating the
reliability of the measurements reported in Figure 2a even when
they refer to high Ct.

Another remarkable feature of the biosensor described here relies
on its sensitivity to the virion rather than to its content (RNA).
The importance of this is twofold: 1) after the calibration of the
optical response, the biosensor lends itself as a powerful tool to
quantify the viral load, a non-trivial issue in diagnostic assays in
virology; 2) being sensitive only to the virions, the biosensor detects the presence of active viral particles; thus, our method is apt
to assess the actual degree of infectiveness of a specimen. Conversely the qualitative RT-PCR assays do not allow to clearly discriminate between high infective samples from those containing
inactive virus.

The behavior of the
as a function of the virion concentration C reported in Figure 3 can be described by the four parameters Hill equation36

(1)
In Equation 1,
is the OD of the “control”,
is
the maximum OD560 variation, K is the concentration (in this case
it is a relative concentration) at which the OD 560 variation reaches
50% of its maximum and n is the so-called Hill’s coefficient. 37The
best fit of the experimental data with Equation 1 yielded the curve
in Figure 3 and the following values for the parameters:

As a final remark, we point out that the colorimetric solution described here can be easily modified to target other viruses. Thus,
we expect that single-step colorimetric detection of viruses can
become a general technique to be used for laboratory applications
as well as point-of-care testing.

The (relative) concentration K is essentially undetermined as a
consequence of the high detection range of our method, which entails small response to the concentration changes (low sensitivity),
