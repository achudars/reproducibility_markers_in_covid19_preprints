Abstract
Previous reports indicate that there may be an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission during singing events. We describe SARS-CoV-2
transmission in six singing events from September–October 2020, across the Netherlands, with
attack rates from 25–74%. We investigated potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for each
event. Events included 9–21 persons, aged 20–79 years. SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely took
place during five out of six events; a possible index case could be identified in four out of five
clusters. Limited sequencing data was available, hampering interpretation of results. Indirect
contact and droplet transmission (<1.5m) may have caused some cases, but are unlikely to explain
the high attack rates. The previously published AirCoV2 model indicated that airborne transmission
(via infectious droplets/ aerosols over longer distances (>1.5m)) due to singing is possible in case
of supershedder presence (≥1010 RNA copies/mL). Also, airflow expelling respiratory droplets over
longer distances (>1.5m) may have influenced transmission. In conclusion, a combination of
transmission routes probably caused these five clusters. Proportions attributable to each route
cannot be deduced. It is possible that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to singing (partly)
led to the high attack rates observed in these clusters.

Introduction
Several outbreaks with a high attack rate among singing groups, including several in the
Netherlands, were described in literature and media from March until September 2020 [1-6]
suggesting a possible elevated risk of singing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) transmission. It was unclear whether the outbreaks were the result of frequent and
prolonged social contact (<1.5m) before, during, or after the singing event, or whether singing itself
was a risk [7]. Singing groups stopped practicing from March 2020 in the Netherlands due to
widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 alongside other lockdown measures. Due to the
decreasing incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the summer and easing of
restrictions, singing in groups was allowed again in the Netherlands from July 2020. General
national advice included quarantining at home following contact with a positive case, staying at
home when experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms until the test result was known and keeping
1.5m distance from persons other than household members. Specific recommendations for singing
in groups included singing in a zigzag formation and following ventilation advice guidelines,
including using a room with mandatory ventilation rates for gatherings and regular venting when
people were not in the room (e.g. during breaks) [7]. Face mask use in public places was not
obligatory during this period. In the Netherlands, approximately one million singers participate in 24
000 choirs [8] and an estimated 70% of choirs resumed practicing from September 2020. From
September through October 2020, there was a rapid increase in the weekly incidence of COVID-19
in the Netherlands from 31.4 to 391 per 100 000 [9].
Outbreak detection
From September through October 2020, we investigated six clusters of COVID-19 cases among
attendees of singing events that were reported to the National Institute for Public Health and
Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands. Four clusters were reported to relate to choir rehearsals,
one to a choir performance and one to a singing ensemble during a church service. An
investigation was carried out to establish whether singing increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2

transmission during these events. Here, we describe the outbreaks in terms of person, place and
time and depict potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for each event.

Methods
Epidemiological investigations
Data on the six singing events were retrospectively first collected from a focal point by phone or
email and then from singing group members via an online questionnaire. Information was
consolidated with data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Formation
diagrams were provided which illustrated the position of singing group members for each event.
Diagrams were simplified and information was aggregated to protect data confidentiality.
Laboratory detection
During the investigation period, the testing policy in the Netherlands was that persons experiencing
COVID-19-like symptoms could be tested free of charge. However, several, but not all,
asymptomatic persons were also tested on their own accord. We followed up on laboratory
specimens for all confirmed cases for whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing to identify possible
source cases and to assess sequence clustering.
Outbreak case definitions
An outbreak confirmed case was defined as a person who was a singing group member* (singer,
conductor or musician) and with a respiratory sample testing RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2.
An outbreak probable case was a person who was a singing group member* (singer, conductor or
musician) and developed at least one of the following symptoms: cough, fever, sore throat, runny
nose, increased or sudden loss of taste, loss of smell, fatigue, and shortness of breath, within 14
days prior, or 14 days following the singing event.
*In one singing event, a preacher was also considered a member of the singing group due to being
in close proximity of the singing group members.

Route of transmission definitions
Droplet transmission is infection spread through exposure to virus-containing respiratory droplets
(i.e., larger and smaller droplets and particles) exhaled by an infectious person [10]. Transmission
is most likely to occur when someone is close to the infectious person, generally within 1.5m
distance (e.g. contact with respiratory droplets after a cough). Respiratory droplets can be expelled
further than 1.5m because of air currents or forceful ejections (e.g. violent sneeze) [11, 12]
Indirect contact transmission is infection after contact with an article or surface that has become
contaminated [10].
Airborne transmission is infection spread through exposure to those virus-containing respiratory
droplets comprised of smaller droplets and particles that can remain suspended in the air and,
therefore be transported over longer distances (several metres) and time (typically hours) [10].
Aerosol transmission model
We used model AirCoV2 (version 1.5) described by Schijven et al. [13] to assess under which
circumstances aerosols production by singing could have led to the attack rates observed in the six
singing events. The scenarios developed are based on the event circumstances, although
insufficient information was available to exactly simulate the circumstances. The model assumes
an even distribution of aerosols containing virus particles across the space, and relatively high,
estimates of virus infectivity [13]. The model was applied for 20 scenarios encompassing a small
and large room (300 vs 3000m3), exposure times of 30, 60 and 120 minutes, no ventilation, one or
six air exchanges per hour (ACH). The model also includes concentration of 107 or 1010 virus RNA
copies per mL mucus (where 1010 represents the presence of a supershedder) [13, 14].
Ethical statement
The outbreak investigations were carried out in accordance with the Dutch Public Health Act.
Participation in the questionnaire was voluntary and online informed consent was obtained.

Results
Description of the singing events
We report on six separate singing events across the Netherlands with attack rates from 25–74%
(Table 1). The response rate to the online questionnaires ranged from 58–100%. Events included
9–21 persons, aged 20–79 years (Table 1).
Singing event 1
In singing event 1, 14 confirmed cases developed COVID-19 within 12 days of the event, of whom
12 experienced symptoms (Figure 1). One confirmed case was hospitalised. Transmission likely
occurred during the event for these 14 cases as this was the common place of exposure. A single
index case could not be clearly identified as seven persons had their symptom onset three days
following the event (Figure 1). No one reported contact with a positive case in the 14 days prior to
the event, two persons had contact with a positive case in the 14 days following the event, and one
person did not specify the date (Table 2). Three pairs travelled to and from the event together by
car. In one pair, one person may have infected the other via droplet transmission outside of the
event as there were eight days between their symptom onset and they lived together. In the other
two pairs, only one person in each pair tested positive. Movement during the break was limited as
singing group members remained in place and staff served coffee. Droplet transmission between
singing group members during the event and break was less likely due to reduced movement and
singing group members stated that they kept 1.5m distance throughout the event (Table 2). Indirect
contact transmission was not likely due to limited common contact of surfaces. Doors to the event
room were kept open and thus, there was limited touching of door handles. The room size of
14x14x2.6m (510m3) was adequate for 19 singing group members including three rows of six to
seven persons and an additional row with the conductor to keep 1.5m distance from each other
(Table 1). Natural ventilation through open doors was in place as well as a system to expel indoor
air to outside through a heat exchanger. A few singing group members felt a cold draft on one side
of the room, however, cases were widely dispersed throughout the room (Figure 2). The fact that
cases were widely dispersed throughout the room could be consistent with airborne transmission

(Table 3). Additionally, transmission through a possible directional airflow with respiratory droplets
cannot be ruled out.
Singing event 2
In singing event 2, 13 confirmed cases developed COVID-19 within eight days of the event, of
whom 11 experienced symptoms (Figure 1). One probable case was also reported. Transmission
likely occured during the event. Two possible index cases with symptom onset two days following
the event were identified (Figure 1). No one reported contact with a positive case in the 14 days
prior to the event and one person had contact with a positive case in the 14 days following the
event (Table 2). Six singing group members travelled together by bicycle, and two pairs by car. Of
the six who travelled by bicycle, two were confirmed cases. Among the two pairs who travelled by
car; one pair included two confirmed cases and the other pair included one confirmed case.
Singing group members used their own sheet music and toilets were spacious. As shared surfaces
that could be touched were limited, it is less likely that indirect contact transmission occurred. All
singing group members stated that they kept 1.5m distance from each other during the event
(Table 3), therefore droplet transmission via close contact is less likely. The room size of 80m2
(and pointed roof of ~8m) may not have been sufficient for 21 singing group members in six rows
including two to five persons and an additional row with the conductor to keep 1.5m distance from
each other. Only natural ventilation through open doors and windows (which were tilted open) was
used throughout the event. Airborne transmission is a possible route of transmission. The widely
dispersed cases throughout the room could be consistent with airborne transmission (Table 3).
Singing event 3
In singing event 3, a cluster was reported to be related to the event, however further investigations
revealed that SARS-CoV-2 transmission most likely occurred outside of the event. Three out of
four confirmed cases likely had close contact outside of the event. The index case of the cluster
was identified by earliest date of symptom onset, however there may have been two potentially
infectious persons present at the event according to their symptom onsets (Figure 1). Sequencing
revealed two identical strains between one singing group member and a close contact (who was

not part of the singing group) who were both likely secondary cases of the index case. A fourth
confirmed case, who was not related to the cases that had likely close contact outside of the event,
was also reported. The transmission route of this fourth case could not be clearly identified.
Additionally, sequencing was not available for this case so it is unclear if a link was present. The
event took place during a church service which lasted 60 minutes and included only 20 minutes of
singing without a break. Singing group members stated that they kept 1.5m distance from each
other during the event. There were limited common surfaces that could have been touched by
singing group members, it is less likely that indirect transmission occurred with relation to the fourth
case (Table 3). Natural ventilation was in place during the event. The size of the church hall is
unknown. Airborne transmission is less likely as there were no reported cases in between the
fourth case and the cases who had close contact outside of the event (Table 3).
Singing event 4
In singing event 4, eight confirmed cases developed COVID-19 within seven days, of whom six
experienced symptoms (Figure 1). Transmission most likely occurred at the event for these cases.
A possible index case was identified with symptom onset on the day after the event (Figure 1). This
case also mentioned contact with a positive case, however, the date was not specified. An
additional person reported contact with a positive case in the 14 days prior to the event however,
this person’s symptom onset was seven days following the event, therefore they are unlikely to be
an index case. No persons had contact with a positive case in the 14 days following the event
(Table 2). Singing group members stated that they may not have kept 1.5m distance between each
other throughout the break (Table 3). Droplet transmission may have occurred via close contact
during these moments. Two pairs travelled together by car, and both tested positive in one pair,
whereas the other pair included one person who was negative and one person who was not tested.
Common surfaces were limited with spacious and separate toilets for men and women. Therefore,
indirect contact transmission is less likely to have occurred (Table 3). The room size of 11x8.5x6m3
(561m3) was just adequate for 15 singing group members to keep 1.5m distance from each other
in a zigzag semi-circle formation. Natural ventilation through open windows and a door, and a
ceiling ventilation system was in place during the event. Airborne transmission is a possible route

of transmission (Table 3). Cases were widely dispersed throughout the room which may be
consistent with airborne transmission. Six singing group members, of whom four were confirmed
cases felt a cold air draft, however, the exact direction is not known. Transmission through the
presence of a possible directional airflow cannot be ruled out.
Singing event 5
In singing event 5, seven confirmed cases developed COVID-19 within six days of the event and
all experienced symptoms (Figure 1). One probable case was also reported. A possible index case
was identified who had symptom onset on the day of the event (Figure 1). No one reported contact
with a positive case in the 14 days prior to the event and no persons had contact with a positive
case in the 14 days following the event (Table 2). Six singing group members travelled together;
two pairs by bicycle (all tested positive) and one pair by car (one tested positive, and the other was
not tested, nor had symptoms). Singing group members stated that they kept 1.5m distance
throughout the event, therefore droplet transmission is less likely (Table 3). During the break, a
coffee machine was used which required pushing a button. Three to four singing group members
assisted with stacking chairs. The occurrence of indirect contact transmission cannot be ruled out
in these situations and may have been possible. The room size of ~320m3 was adequate for 14
singing group members in three rows of two to five persons and an additional row with the
conductor to keep 1.5m distance from one another. Natural ventilation through open doors and
windows was used and mechanical ventilation may have possibly been in place during the event.
Two persons reported feeling a cold air draft, however specific information is lacking about airflow
in the room. Respiratory droplet transmission further than 1.5m due to airflow cannot be ruled out.
Even though ventilation measures were in place, airborne transmission is a possible mode of
transmission. Cases were widely dispersed throughout the room which may be consistent with
possible airborne transmission (Table 4). Additionally, available sequencing revealed two identical
strains in two persons who were positioned on opposite sides of the room (Table 1, Figure 2).

In singing event 6, six confirmed cases developed COVID-19 within eight days of the event and all
experienced symptoms (Figure 1). A possible index case was identified with symptom onset on the
day after the event (Figure 1). This case was likely to have had contact with positive cases during
work in the week prior to the event. As singing group members stated that they kept 1.5m distance,
droplet transmission is less likely to have occurred (Table 3). No common objects were reported to
have been touched and microphones were used by the same individual throughout the event.
Indirect contact transmission is less likely to have occurred (Table 3). Sequencing revealed four
out of five identical strains in persons who were positioned near each other. The room size of
20x15x10m3 (3000m3) seemed adequate for the eight singing group members, one preacher and
attendees of the church service. Screens were placed in front of the singing group members and in
between attendees of the service. It is not known how use of screens influenced transmission.
Data was available for 58% of church service attendees (morning and afternoon). A maximum of
30 attendees were allowed at each service and singing group members were only present in the
afternoon. Only one positive case is known among the attendees with possible exposure at the
afternoon service and it is unclear whether the case is linked to the confirmed cases among the
singing group members as sequencing was not done. Natural ventilation and air heating was used
throughout the event. Airborne transmission remains possible as even though singing group
members were distanced, persons positioned up to three persons away from the possible index
case were still infected.
Aerosol transmission model
The AirCoV2 model showed that the mean risk of illness of one person was 86% (54-100%) in
case of a smaller room (300m3), 120 minutes of exposure time, one ACH, and presence of a
supershedder (Table 4, Scenario 8). In a 10-fold larger room (3000m3), the mean risk of illness of
one person was approximately four fold lower (24%; Table 4, Scenario 18). Room sizes for the
singing events ranged from 320-3000m3. Halving the exposure time (60 minutes), reduced the
mean risk of illness by one-third (58%;Table 4, Scenario 5). Singing events ranged from 60-150
minutes with singing duration lasting from 20-120 minutes. Also increasing the ventilation to six
ACH (9L/sec/person) reduced the dose and risk by approximately one-third (54%; Table 4,

Scenario 9). Exact information on the number of ACH for each singing event was not known.
Based on the received information about the ventilation measures, events 1 and 5 could have had
three ACH or more. For other events, one ACH or less is more likely. The mean risk of illness in
case of presence of a supershedder was 94% with no ACH, exposure time of 120 minutes, in a
small room (Table 4, Scenario 7) compared to 0.48% with no supershedder present (Table 4,
Scenario 10). Information on CT values for cases was not known, and therefore the presence of a
supershedder among the six events is unknown.
Outbreak control measures
Due to the higher COVID-19 incidence among the population during this period and several
clusters of SARS-CoV-2 cases occurring among singing groups from September to October 2020,
the National Outbreak Management Team (OMT) in the Netherlands advised against group singing
in any context on 3 November 2020, which was supported by the Dutch government [15]. The
OMT advised that group singing can be allowed if the risk level is 'Vigilant' (Rt < 1 and incidence
≤7/100.000/day), as the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 by singing in groups is small, mostly
based on the likely absence of an active shedder.

Discussion
All events had high attack rates ranging from 25-74% demonstrating the high risk in these settings.
Based on available epidemiological information, it is likely that transmission for most singing group
members took place at the singing events itself except for singing event 3 and those living
together. In these five events, cases had little to no contact outside of the events except for those
who lived and travelled together to the event. At least 10 persons lived together and seven of these
were confirmed cases. In all events, at least one singing group member reported their symptom
onset between 0–3 days following the event (Figure 1). These singing group members were
potentially contagious during the events and this corresponds with known transmission dynamics
of SARS-CoV-2 with higher levels of shedding just prior to development of symptoms [16, 17]. A

possible index case could be identified in four out of five clusters according to available
information. Different transmission routes including droplet, indirect contact and airborne
transmission may have led to cases.
Droplet and indirect contact transmission
The main transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 include droplet and indirect contact transmission
[10, 18]. The Dutch national advice for singing groups as well as in other countries is directed at
preventing these transmission routes [7, 19]. In general, the six singing groups tried to adhere to
this advice. From available information, droplet transmission through prolonged social contact
during the singing event itself seemed unlikely. Air currents from person to person because of open
windows and doors or mechanical ventilation may have increased SARS-CoV-2 droplet
transmission during these events, as droplets could have moved over longer distances (>1.5m)
[20]. It remains possible that even if there is adequate ventilation but air currents are present, the
increased dispersion of droplets produced by singing may be sufficient to increase droplet
transmission. Although there is insufficient evidence regarding air currents, this possibility cannot
be ruled out. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Dutch national
guidelines on ventilation discourage the opening of doors and windows against each other when
persons are present in the room in order to prevent airflows from person to person [21, 22].
Another possible transmission route may have been through indirect contact transmission via
contaminated shared surfaces as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected on surfaces for up to 72 hours
in various environmental conditions [23]. Limited shared surfaces were present and only several
singing group members reported touching common surfaces; the high attack rates are also difficult
to explain solely through this transmission route.
Airborne transmission
Singing expels approximately 10–15 times as much aerosols as speaking [13]. Additionally, singing
increases aerosol dispersion compared to speaking and the amount of aerosols expelled increases
with voice loudness [13, 24-27]. In the AirCoV2 model, the mean probability of illness fell within
the range or was higher than the observed attack rates for the singing events described in this

outbreak investigation in scenarios with at least 60 minutes of singing in a small room, and in
scenarios with 120 minutes of singing in a large room with no or little ventilation, with presence of a
supershedder. Insufficient information was available on the precise circumstances of the singing
events to exactly simulate the clusters using the model. The number of ACH was not obtained and
the event descriptions did not provide enough information to determine its role. Overall, the model
indicated that high virus concentrations, i.e. as in the presence of a supershedder, are required in
order to explain high attack rates via this transmission route. The model assumes equal spread of
aerosols in the room, however, this is not likely in large spaces. The singing event rooms were
generally large in size. If the air was not fully mixed, it may have been possible that the air in the
exhaled plume of the infectious person would have higher viral concentrations than the air in the
far corner of the room, and thus gave rise to higher exposure closer to the infectious person. In the
events, cases were dispersed throughout the room which may be consistent with airborne
transmission.
According to the AirCov2 model, the presence of a supershedder in the room is needed to achieve
relevant risks of illness by aerosol transmission [20, 28-30]. From September to October 2020,
1.4% persons were infected in the Dutch population. Given that 2.7% of infected persons may
have been a possible supershedder (1010 virus mL in mucus) [13], then an estimated 95
supershedders of 3528 contagious persons would have been present among 252 000 singing
group members (~15 singers in each singing group) from September to October 2020. Therefore,
the presence of supershedders among the five singing events is plausible. We cannot confirm the
presence of a supershedder since we did not have information on CT-values for confirmed cases.
It is also possible that multiple source cases may have been present in at least two events which
could have contributed to the high attack rates.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths; this is the first outbreak investigation which investigates COVID19 clusters in several singing groups worldwide. Second, the overall high response rate provided a
good indication of the circumstances in which the singing events took place. Third, the

questionnaire included questions aimed at identifying direct, indirect and airborne transmission
routes. A limitation of this study is the low number of specimens on which we could perform
phylogenetic analysis due to limited specimen storage time (usually one week) during the period of
the outbreak investigation. Also, a large number of laboratories were involved coupled with a high
work load for the public health services. Additionally, asymptomatic cases may have been missed
as not all persons were tested. Therefore, we could not identify the number of possible source
cases present at the events and/or confirming that the singing group members were infected by a
common source. Thirdly, the exact circumstances regarding airflow direction for each of the events
was not known, and could not be accounted for in the model. It was also dependent on the weather
of that day for the events using natural ventilation. Lastly, due to the retrospective nature of the
questionnaires, recall bias could have affected the responses of the participants which indicated
the likeliness of dropet or indirect contact transmission. However, almost all singing group
members did describe similar circumstances in which the events took place.

Conclusions
These outbreaks with high attack rates demonstrate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission
linked to singing events. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the described outbreaks were
possibly caused by a combination of different transmission routes as none of the possible
transmission routes could be ruled out. Due to the observational nature of this study, it was difficult
to reconstruct the exact circumstances of the clusters and the proportions attributable to each
possible transmission route could not be deduced. Indirect contact and droplet transmission
(<1.5m) may have occurred and may have been the cause of some of the cases, but it is unlikely
to explain the high attack rates. The described AirCoV2 model indicated that airborne transmission
(via infectious droplets/ aerosols over longer distances) was possible if a supershedder was
present. Additionally, multiple index cases may have been present. However, the airflow as
reported may also have expelled respiratory droplets over longer distances and previous studies
have shown that directional airflow may possibly influence transmission [12, 31]. Further research

is needed into the role of airflow and the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in singing groups.
Additionally, increased phylogenetic analysis should be performed to identify potential source
cases to better assess clusters. Serology could also be performed to identify susceptible cases.
In the clusters described here, it is possible that singing itself increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2
transmission through airborne transmission. Therefore, when COVID-19 measures are eased and
group gatherings are allowed, specific recommendation regarding singing in groups may be
needed.
