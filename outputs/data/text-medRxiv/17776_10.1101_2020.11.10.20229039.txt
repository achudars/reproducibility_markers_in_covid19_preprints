Key Points
Question: What is the physical and mental health of patients with severe mental illness
during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic?
Findings: In this cross-sectional study that included 1071 patients at a psychiatric outpatient
clinic, the proportion of patients reporting respiratory symptoms were 4%. In addition, 19%
of patients reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms, with 2.5% needing an earlier
follow-up than was planned.
Meaning: Patients with severe mental illness experienced stability in the management of
their psychiatric symptoms during the early pandemic phase in Sweden.

Abstract
Importance: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restricts access to care for psychiatric
patients. The physical and mental well-being of patients with severe mental illness in the
current circumstances is unknown.
Objective: To evaluate physical and mental well-being, subjective mental health, and need
for updated psychiatric management plans in a sample of patients with severe mental illness
during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design: Cross-sectional study of structured telephone assessments conducted between April
23 and June 30, 2020.
Setting: Regional psychiatric outpatient care centre in Stockholm, Sweden.
Participants: Patients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric clinic between
April 9 and April 23, 2020. A total of 1071 patients were contacted by phone.
Exposures: Occurrence of respiratory symptoms, changes in psychiatric symptoms, and the
need for updated psychiatric management plans, as determined by the telephone assessors.
Subjective mental health rated 0-100 by patients.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-rated physical, respiratory and psychiatric symptoms
according to a semi-structured interview. Subjective mental health rated on a scale from 0100.
Results: Patients (n = 1071) were on average 45 years old (SD = 16.9), of which 570 (53%)
were female. Neurodevelopmental disorders, psychotic disorders, and bipolar disorder were
the most common diagnostic categories. The majority of respondents reported no respiratory
symptoms (86%), and few reported light (10%) or severe (4%) respiratory symptoms.
Similarly, most patients reported no worsening in psychiatric symptoms (81%). For those
who reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms (19%), the psychiatric management plans
that were already in place were deemed appropriate in most cases (16.5%), whereas 22
patients (2.5%) reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms that warranted an earlier or
immediate follow-up by their psychiatric clinic. Patients rated their subjective mental health
on a 0-100 scale as 70.5 [95% CI 69 - 71.9] on average (n = 841). Response rates to the
questions of the structured assessment varied from 79% - 82%.

Conclusions and Relevance: The majority of patients reported no respiratory symptoms, no
change in psychiatric symptoms and a rather high subjective well-being. Patients in
psychiatric care with a mental health care plan experienced stability in the management of
their psychiatric symptoms and general well-being, and only a minority were in need of acute
support during the early pandemic phase in Stockholm, Sweden.

Background
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has wide-ranging consequences for everyday life across
the globe, with physical distancing, closing of public spaces and other measures1 taken by
most countries to limit the spread of the virus2. These restrictions also affect patients with
severe mental illness (SMI) due to the rapid and dramatic changes that took place in the
landscape of regular psychiatric health care. Public health experts and researchers have
warned that the impact of the pandemic in itself, societal measures to limit the spread of
disease, and changes in health care delivery may create a perfect storm of secondary adverse
consequences, such as increase in suicide risk, however such an increase has not been
observed in available data to date3,4. Patients with SMI are a particularly vulnerable group in
society5, and recent findings also indicate that they are more likely to contract and die from
COVID-19 compared to the general population6,7. Policy makers and funders now call for
studies8 that can shed light on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups,
and to improve knowledge on how to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic.
Patients with SMI may experience a worsening of symptoms as a consequence of strict social
distancing measures, economic downturns and changes in the delivery of care9. Reports
emerging from China indicate that home isolation has negative psychological effects10 for a
majority of the population11. In response to the disease outbreak, mental health services in the
Lombardy region in Italy12 restricted access to day centres and greatly reduced the number of

home-visits. A Chinese survey on 2065 psychiatric outpatients reported that 21% of
respondents experienced a deterioration of their mental health, and 22% reported a lack of
access to adequate care during the pandemic13. Patients may also be hesitant to contact or
visit their psychiatric clinic out of fear of contamination or putting an undue burden on the
health care system. At the same time, they are faced with a situation of having to access and
navigate care when needed via remote and digital modes14, a method that is not only novel
but also raises the threshold of difficulty, for many in this already vulnerable group. For
example, there was a 25% decrease in visits to the emergency psychiatric unit in Stockholm
between March 1st and April 23rd, compared to the same dates in 2019. Taken together,
these reports on possible negative impact in patients with SMI warrants research that
investigates the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychiatric population.
The aims of this project were to study the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical
and mental health of patients with SMI at a large psychiatric clinic in Stockholm, Sweden
during the early pandemic phase.

Method
Study design
This study describes the results of an outreach initiative that was part of the response to the
COVID-19 pandemic at a large psychiatric clinic in Stockholm, Sweden. Data was extracted
from the electronic health records of each individual, where the outreach phone calls were
documented. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Agency in Sweden (no. 202003474). The need for informed consent was waived since the research team only accessed
pseudonymized data where it was not possible to identify individual patients.

Procedure

Between April 23rd and June 30th, patients who had not been in touch with their psychiatric
clinic since April 9 were contacted via telephone by clinical staff. The purpose was to provide
information about available care, to arrange an appointment if deemed necessary, and assess
changes in psychiatric symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic in Sweden (March 1st).
The assessments contained a series of semi-structured questions about the patients’ overall
health, psychiatric symptoms, and reasons for not contacting their psychiatric clinic. Patients
were informed about how they could contact their psychiatric clinic, and psychiatric
management plans were updated if necessary (for example risk management plans or changes
in pharmacological treatment). The phone calls followed a pre-specified routine and staff
entered responses according to a template specifically designed for the outreach contact. For
respiratory symptoms, the staff could enter one of four options: 1) No respiratory symptoms,
2) Light respiratory symptoms, no need for follow-up in health care, 3) Severe respiratory
symptoms, has already been in touch with health care, 4) Severe respiratory symptoms, has
not been in touch with health care. For psychiatric symptoms the responses were categorized
as follows: 1) No signs of worsening of psychiatric symptoms, 2) Worsening of psychiatric
symptoms but existing psychiatric management plan is adequate, 3) Worsening of psychiatric
symptoms and need for earlier follow-up, 4) Worsening of psychiatric symptoms and need
for immediate follow-up. Staff attempted to contact patients on two consecutive days, and
sent a letter with instructions to contact their clinic if they were not reachable by phone.

Participants
Eligible individuals were patients listed at the psychiatric clinic who had not been in touch
with the clinic in the last 14 days prior to April 23, 2020. Patients listed at the psychiatric
clinic were either waiting for treatment, had an ongoing treatment, or other scheduled
appointments (such as regular visits) in order to follow up the effects of pharmacological and

psychological treatments. The psychiatric clinic (Psykiatri Sydväst; Huddinge Karolinska
Hospital) is part of the public health care system in Stockholm Region and responsible for
providing psychiatric care to residents living in the south-west region of Stockholm, which
has 207 454 residents. The clinic is divided into specialized sub-units, each focused on a
specific type of diagnosis or care process: emergency psychiatric care, intake and diagnostics,
anxiety disorders and depression, psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, neurodevelopmental
disorders, personality disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, traumatic
disorders, and one unit for deaf patients with psychiatric disorders.

Statistical analyses
The content of the electronic health records was extracted and classified according to prespecified categories from the outreach template. Data on age and gender was included, and
diagnosis was categorized according to the psychiatric unit where the patient was listed. This
study did not involve hypothesis testing and the results presented below are descriptive. For
the outcomes of physical symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and changes to psychiatric
management plans, the frequency of each type of response was summarized and compared to
the total number of responses to obtain percentages. For the rating of subjective health, the
mean value and standard deviation was calculated. The responses were compared between
the units using linear or logistic regression, including age and gender as co-variates. The
statistical software R (version 4.0.2)15 was used for all analyses. Scripts used for statistical
analyses are available on the Open Science Framework
(http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NP7MU).

In total, 1071 patients were contacted via telephone and responses to the specific questions
were answered by a majority (79%-82%). The average age of the patients was 45 years (SD =
16.9, range 19-89), and 570 (53%) were women. The majority of the assessments were
conducted at the unit for neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 293, 25%), followed by
psychotic disorders (n = 249, 21%) and bipolar disorder (n = 245, 21%). Telephone
assessments were completed in April (n = 16, 1%), May (n = 807, 75%) and June (n = 248,
23%).

Occurrence of respiratory symptoms
A total of 879 patients responded to the question about whether they had experienced any
respiratory symptoms, of which a majority reported no symptoms (n = 755, 86%). Fewer
reported light symptoms that did not warrant contact with health care (n = 87, 10%) or severe
symptoms that indicated a need to visit the health care system for assessment and treatment
(n = 37, 4%). Light or severe symptoms were less common among men compared to women
(OR = 0.5 [95% CI 0.33 to 0.76], SE = 0.22, p = 0.001), and were less common at the unit for
bipolar disorder compared to other units (OR = 0.21 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.46], SE = 0.41, p <
0.001).

Changes in psychiatric symptoms and management plans
The majority of patients who responded to the question about their psychiatric symptoms (n =
861) reported no immediate worsening of their psychiatric symptoms (n = 696, 81%), and
among those who reported a worsening of symptoms (n = 165, 19%) the psychiatric
management plan already in place was deemed adequate in most cases (n = 143, 16.6%). A
total of 22 patients (2.5%) needed an earlier or immediate follow-up at their psychiatric clinic
than was previously planned. Men were less likely to report a worsening of symptoms (OR =

0.51 [95% CI 0.35 to 0.75], SE = 0.19, p = 0.001), and patients at the unit for bipolar
disorders were less likely to experience a worsening of symptoms compared to the other units
(OR = 0.22 [95% CI 0.10 to 0.44], SE = 0.37, p < 0.001). In contrast, patients at the
emergency psychiatric unit (OR = 2.19 [95% CI 1.29 to 3.74], SE = 0.27, p = 0.004) and the
unit for anxiety disorders and depression (OR = 1.85 [95% CI 1.02 to 3.32], SE = 0.3, p =
0.04) were more likely to report a worsening of their psychiatric symptoms.

Subjective rating of mental health
Patients were asked to rate their mental health on a scale from 0 (worst possible health) to
100 (best possible health.) The average rating was 70.5 [95% CI 69 - 71.9] among the 841
respondents to this question. Men reported better mental health compared to women
(Estimate = 3.73 [95% CI 0.95 to 6.51], SE = 1.41, p = 0.008) and there was a positive
association between year of birth and subjective mental health (Estimate = 0.11 [95% CI
0.012 to 0.21], SE = 0.05, p = 0.029), as younger patients rated their mental health higher on
average. Patients at the unit for bipolar disorder (Estimate = 12.5 [8.07 to 16.96], SE = 2.26,
p < 0.001) and psychotic disorders (Estimate = 4.84 [95% CI 0.59 to 9.09], SE = 2.24, p =
0.026) reported a higher subjective mental health, whereas patients at the emergency
psychiatric unit (Estimate = -8.35 [95% CI -13.03 to -3.67], SE = 2.38, p = <0.001), unit for
traumatic disorders (Estimate = -12.09 [95% CI -20.44 to -3.75], SE = 4.25, p = 0.005), and
unit for anxiety disorders and depression (Estimate = -6.14 [95% CI -11.35 to -0.94], SE =
2.65, p = 0.021) rated their mental health as lower.

This study describes the results of a clinical outreach initiative taken at a large psychiatric
clinic in Stockholm during the early phase of the COVID 19 pandemic. The need for an
outreach initiative was established after observing a dramatic reduction (25%) in the number
of patients seeking emergency psychiatric care in Stockholm in March and April 2020,
compared to the same period in 2019. The purpose of the outreach was threefold: 1) evaluate
the physical and mental health of patients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric
clinic during the early pandemic phase, 2) provide emergency response to those who needed
it and, 3) inform that care was available to them.
Although 19% of 861 patients had experienced a worsening of their psychiatric symptoms,
the existing psychiatric management plans were sufficient in the majority of cases with only
2.5% needing an earlier or immediate follow-up. Interestingly, few patients (4%) reported
respiratory symptoms that indicated a need for follow-up in the health care system. The
findings also indicate that men, compared to women, reported fewer respiratory symptoms,
were less likely to report a worsening of their psychiatric symptoms, and rated their
subjective mental health as better. Furthermore, age showed no association with any of the
outcomes in this study. Finally, patients at the unit for bipolar disorder responded more
positively to all of the questions, likely due to follow-up within psychiatry also in stable
phases. This is in contrast to the emergency unit, where patients are only seen in the acute
phase of mental illness.
Similar to an early Chinese survey of 2065 psychiatric patients13, we found a comparable rate
of deterioration in psychiatric symptoms at 20%. However, the access to care was higher in
the Swedish sample and fewer patients reported unmet needs in the current study: 22% of
respondents in the Chinese survey could not access their routine psychiatric care due to
suspended hospital visits, whereas in the present study only 2.5% of patients needed an
updated psychiatric management plan. Further, psychiatric wards in Sweden remained open

and patients with mental illness as well as those infected with COVID-19 were able to
receive inpatient care in isolated wards. An early report from the Lombardy region in Italy
describes a closing of psychiatric wards and reallocation of staff towards managing patients
with COVID-1912, which was not the case in Sweden. Although methodological differences
in sampling and screening may explain differences between studies across countries, we
speculate that the policies in Sweden, for example no lockdown, and sustained functionality
of the specialised psychiatric care may have resulted in better access to care among
individuals with severe mental illness during the early pandemic phase16.
This study is not without limitations. First, the study population was restricted to those
patients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric clinic during the early stages of
the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. The reasons for not being in touch likely varied
between the patients: some may not have been in touch because they had been feeling better
after receiving treatment, or were in a stable phase. However, for other patients the reason for
not being in touch with their clinic could have been a direct consequence of the pandemic or
the societal measures taken to reduce transmission of the virus. Second, there is no data
before the pandemic to serve as a reference point. It is likely that, at any given time, some
patients will report a deterioration in psychiatric symptoms, for example. Without a direct
comparison it is hard to assess whether the findings indicate that the situation has gotten
worse or can be viewed as relatively stable. Third, the impact of COVID-19 and the policies
implemented to reduce transmission of the virus vary between countries and regions within
countries, making it difficult to generalize the current findings to other contexts.
The long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with SMI is currently unknown
but there is reason to believe that patients with SMI will be negatively affected. For example,
this group of individuals may be particularly vulnerable to the long-term economic effects
leading to unemployment and further isolation from their already frail social networks.

Further, SMI in itself is associated with an increased risk of COVID-196,7. There is therefore
a clear need for continued monitoring of the health in vulnerable populations, such as patients
with SMI, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study on respiratory symptoms, changes in psychiatric symptoms, and
subjective mental health among patients with SMI who had not been in contact with their
clinic for two weeks during the early pandemic phase in Stockholm, found that respiratory
symptoms requiring follow-up in the healthcare system were rare (4%) and that 19% of
patients reported a deterioration in their psychiatric symptoms. However, existing psychiatric
management plans were adequate in the majority of cases and few patients needed an early
follow-up (2.5%). Men reported fewer respiratory symptoms, lower rates of deterioration in
psychiatric symptoms, and better subjective mental health compared to women, and patients
at the unit for bipolar disorder–typically treated in stable phases as well as during manic or
depressive episodes–responded more positively to all outcomes compared to patients at other
units. These findings relate to the early pandemic phase in Sweden, and continued monitoring
of vulnerable groups, such as patients with severe mental illness, is needed as the pandemic
continues and long-term effects can be observed.
