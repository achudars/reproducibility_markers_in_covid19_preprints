Our

that

COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after

1. Introduction

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) arose in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and

spread worldwide rapidly, with the

declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health

Organization (WHO) as of March 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses worldwide, its

psychological impact is increasingly being recognized among the vulnerable groups, including

the health care workers, individuals on quarantine, patients with chronic medical diseases and

psychiatric disorders, as well as the public in general.

Only a few studies have investigated the psychiatric sequelae related to the COVID-19

infection. While delirium, insomnia, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic

stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported as common features in the acute (and immediate

convalescent) period, data are sparse on the psychiatric status in the post-illness phase (Rogers

et al. 2020). To our knowledge, only three studies investigated the psychiatric symptomatology

in the recovered COVID-19 patients, and these reported high rates of insomnia, and symptoms

of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, about one month after the infection (Liu et al. 2020; Mazza et

al.

A recent concern for the patients who had recovered from the COVID-19 infection is the

protracted

symptoms,

such

as

chronic

fatigue,

diffuse

myalgia,

dyspnea,

headache,

and

concentration difficulties which may result in significant disability (Carfi et al. 2020; Townsend

The present study aimed to examine the extent of the psychiatric symptomatology

(symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, sleep impairment, and suicidality) in the recovered

COVID-19

patients.

We

also

evaluated

the

potential

predictors

of

the

significant

PTSD

symptoms, based on a theoretical susceptibility model: the individual pre-trauma and peri-

trauma

factors

(Sareen,

2014)

Lastly,

we

aimed

at

exploring

the

prevalence

of

protracted

symptoms and interrelations of these symptoms with the current psychiatric status.

2. Methods

2.1. Patients and procedure

We performed a cross-sectional survey study investigating the psychological well-being

of patients with ‘probable’ and ‘confirmed’ diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection (ECDPC criteria,

2020), after completion of their medical care. The study population included the adult patients

who had received care at the tertiary hospital of Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty, Istanbul, between

March

15

and

May

15,

2020.

The main areas of interest were the PTSD symptoms, symptoms of anxiety and depression,

sleep impairment, suicidality, and the protracted symptoms. We also investigated the potential

predictors of the PTSD symptoms in the sample based on a theoretical susceptibility model: the

pre-trauma (i.e. demographic characteristics, psychiatric and medical history, past traumatic

experiences) and peri-trauma factors (i.e. severity of the COVID-19 infection, hospitalization

status,

protracted

symptoms,

COVID-19

infection

in

the

social

vicinity,

social

support,

stigmatization, and job loss during the outbreak).

In response to WhatsApp® and SMS invitations, 239 responses were received (response

rate = 20%). Additionally, 79 paper surveys were completed by the volunteering outpatients.

None.

Eventually, 284 surveys with a complete IES-R were included in the analysis. On

average, respondents spent 22 minutes on the online survey.

An informed consent form was presented on the first page of the (electronic or written)

survey citing the purposes and the voluntary nature of the survey, and that all information

provided by the participants would be kept confidential, and they could withdraw from the

survey

at

any

time.

The

procedures

of

this

study

complied

with

the

provisions

of

the

Declaration of Helsinki concerning research on Human participants. The Ethics Committee of

Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty approved this study.

2.2. Data collection, demographic, social and clinical parameters

2.2.1 Questionnaire on the demographic status and the general effects of the outbreak

The survey contained three parts and 128 questions. The first part included a self-

report

to

collect

sociodemographic

variables

of

interest

(age,

gender,

educational, marital and employment status, monthly family income, and household size),

medical

status

(history

chronic

diseases

and

psychiatric

disorders),

and

additional

information relevant to the outbreak and lockdown conditions (having a child below 18

years of age, the presence of an individual in the household above 65 years of age or with

significant medical risks related to the COVID-19, family history of COVID-19, history of

COVID-19 in patient’s relatives, friends and acquaintances, change in patient’s employment

and

personal

view

on

the

seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak: ‘a very serious threat’, ‘a serious threat’, ‘a small

threat’ or ‘not a real threat’).

2.2.2 Questionnaire on patients’ history of the COVID-19 infection

The second part of the survey included questions on the patient’s past COVID-19

infection. We questioned the date the initial symptoms of the infection appeared, a range

sensations on the skin, difficulty in concentration, and daytime sleepiness), the duration of

these symptoms, whether the patient was hospitalized or followed on an outpatient basis,

and a personal view on the general severity of the infectious symptoms experienced 0 (no

symptoms), 1 (very mild symptoms), 2 (mild symptoms), 3 (moderate symptoms), 4 (severe

symptoms), or 5 (very severe symptoms). We also questioned on a checklist whether the

potential symptoms of interest persisted after the acute infectious symptoms subsided.

These symptoms included the alteration of smell and taste, headache, fatigue, daytime

sleepiness, muscle aches, lightheadedness, difficulty in concentration, and numbness and

tingling sensations on the skin.

2.2.3. Review of patients’ medical files

Patients’ medical files were reviewed for the relevant information regarding the COVID-19

clinical severity scoring (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical disease; WHO

criteria, 2020), lowest oxygen saturation levels on pulse oximetry, whether supplemental

oxygen was required during treatment, and the experimental agents administered.

2.3. Psychometric assessment

2.3.1 Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R)

Symptoms of PTSD related to the outbreak were assessed using the Impact of Event

Scale-Revised

(IES-R)

questionnaire

that

for the subjective stress related to a traumatic event. IES-R was

frequently used after a variety of traumatic settings (Morina et al., 2013), and after major

public health crises (Lee et al., 2018; Varshney et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). We made

slight

modifications

to

the

Turkish

adaptation

of

the

IES-R

(Corapcioglu

et

al.,

2006)

(replacing the word ‘event’ with ‘outbreak’, where appropriate) in order to account for the

nature of the event investigated.

2.3.2. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208249; this version posted October 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Anxious and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and

Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983), a 14-item self-report questionnaire.

HADS can assess symptom severity and caseness of anxiety and depressive disorders, and it

consists

of

anxiety

and

subscales.

HADS

was

validated

in

a

variety

of

populations, including the general medical and community settings (Bjelland et al., 2002;

Bocéréan and Dupret, 2014; Djukanovic et al., 2017). HADS was validated previously for

the Turkish population (Aydemir et al., 1997).

2.3.3. Life Events Checklist (LEC)

The

Life

Events

Checklist

(LEC)

was

used

to

screen

for

the

potentially

traumatic

events in the subject’s lifetime. (Gray et al., 2004) LEC is a 17-item, self-report measure

that assesses exposure to 16 events known to potentially lead to PTSD, and one other

extraordinarily stressful event not captured in the list. A past traumatic experiences score

was calculated for each subject based on the number of following items checked by the

subject (i.e. “happened to me”, “witnessed it”, “learned about it” and “part of my job”),

with a possible range of 0 to 68 points.

2.3.4. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)

Sleep impairment in the prior month was assessed by selected items of the Turkish

version

of

the

Pittsburgh

Sleep

Quality

Index

(PSQI),

a

self-report

questionnaire

that

assesses a broad range of sleep dimensions.(Buysse et al., 1989 ) In this study, patients’

sleep

latency

(question

2

and

5a),

sleep

duration

(question

4),

sleep

disturbances

(questions 5b-5j), and subjective sleep quality (question 9) were scored according to PSQI,

each from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. PSQI has been validated

for the Turkish population (Ağargün et al., 1996)

2.3.5. MINI suicidality scale

Suicidality was assessed following the short version of the MINI Suicidality Scale,

which consists of six items scored as ‘yes’ or ‘no’: intentions of self-harm, wish for death,

thoughts of suicide, suicidal plan, attempted suicide in the past month, and lifetime history

of a suicide attempt. The combined suicidality score is calculated based on the weighted

score of each item, with a range of 0–33 points. (Sheehan, D. V. 1998)

2.4. Stigmatization and social support

The patients

rated how much

they felt

they were stigmatized and discriminated

against, on a scale of 0 (never), 1 (very little), 2 (moderately), or 3 (considerably). They also

employed (68.3%), had a university or higher education (50%), had a child less than 18 years of

age (65.3%), and had a household size of 3 or 4 individuals (54.3%).

score equal to or above 33), while 52 subjects (18.3%) had mild PTSD symptoms (or ‘partial’

PTSD; IES-R score equal to or above 24, Creamer et al., 2003)).

Mean sample scores for HADS anxiety and HADS depression were 6.2 (SD=4.6; range=0-

21) and 6.3 (SD=4.3; range=0-21), respectively. Identification of ‘probable’ cases of anxiety and

depression was based on the cutoff scores recommended by the authors of the HADS scale

(Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). Fifty subjects (18.4%) were considered having ‘probable’ anxiety

(HADS anxiety score above 10), and 51 subjects (18.8%) were considered having ‘probable’

depression (HADS depression score above 10).

Overall, of the 72 subjects reporting moderate-to-severe PTSD symptoms, 37 subjects

(51.3%) reported comorbid anxiety, and 29 subjects (40.2%) reported comorbid depression. Of

all the patients, 98 (34.5%) had either moderate-to-severe PTSD, probable anxiety, or probable

depression.

One hundred and one subjects (38.8%) had a subjective sleep quality rating of a ‘fairly

poor or ‘very poor sleep’ in the previous month. Fifty-four subjects (22.4%) had a sleep duration

of 5-6 hours or shorter, and 46 subjects (18.8%) had a sleep latency of an hour or longer.

Overall, of the subjects who reported moderate-to-severe PTSD symptoms, 45 subjects (68.2%)

reported poor sleep (fairly or very poor sleep) in the previous month.

Twenty-one subjects (9.9%) had a positive response to one or more items in the MINI

suicidality scale, and six of these subjects (2.8%) had a ‘moderate’ current risk of suicide, based

on MINI combined score (a score of 6-9). Overall, of the subjects who reported moderate-to-

severe PTSD symptoms, 13 subjects (23.2%) had a positive response to one or more items, and

the current risk of suicide was ‘moderate’ for four of them (7.1%). None of the subjects in our

sample had a ‘high’ current risk of suicide, based on MINI combined score (a score of 10 or

above).

A chi-square test (gender X PTSD severity) showed that PTSD severity differed by gender

X2 (2, N

(

= 284) = 17.27, p<0.001), and a significantly higher number of subjects reporting no

PTSD symptoms were males (p<0.05, post hoc analyses with Bonferroni correction).

to COVID-19, and the status of having a child less than 18 years of age did not differ among the

comparison groups.

Table 2.

The time between the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and the survey response was

48.7 days (SD = 20.4; range = 14-116 days). Two hundred and twenty subjects (88%) had a PCR

confirmed diagnosis, while 30 subjects (12%) were ‘probable’ patients based on the clinical and

CT findings.

The COVID-19 infection severity among subjects based on the WHO criteria is depicted

in Table 2. Of the subjects, 60.1% were followed on an outpatient basis, and 39.9% were

hospitalized. Three subjects had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Of 245 patients

who had oxygen saturation records based on the pulse oximeter, 51 (20.8%) had a saturation

below 94. Similarly, 52 subjects (21.2%) required oxygen treatment during their hospitalization.

0.001). Post hoc Tukey HSD tests indicated that the mean acute symptom burden for the

moderate-to-severe and mild PTSD groups were significantly higher than no PTSD group. Also,

post hoc Tukey HSD tests indicated that the mean length of acute symptoms for the moderate-

3.3. Psychiatric status

The psychiatric status of patients and the analyses of these data across comparison

groups (normal, mild, and moderate-to-severe PTSD symptoms) are summarized in Table 3.

Forty-five patients (15.4%) reported a past diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. Among these

subjects, depression (19 subjects; 6.8%) and anxiety disorders (18 subjects; 6.5%) were the

most common diagnoses, and 18 subjects (6.3%) were on psychiatric treatment. A chi-square

test (past psychiatric disorder X PTSD severity) showed that PTSD severity differed by the

Patients reported a median of 4 traumatic life events (range=0-33), and an ANOVA

3.4. Outbreak-related variables, media use, stigmatization and social support (Table 4)

One hundred and seventy patients (60.3%) reported that a family member, 51 patients

(18.1%) reported that a relative, 40 patients (14.2%) reported that a friend, and 40 patients

(14.2%) reported that an acquaintance contracted the COVID-19 infection. Overall, 222 patients

A

chi-square

analysis revealed that the frequency of the report that someone with the infection existed in

the social vicinity was not significantly different between the PTSD severity groups.

The responses of ‘moderately’ or ‘considerably’ to the question on whether the subject

felt stigmatized or discriminated against after the diagnosis were scored as significant social

TV (84%) and social media (72%) were reported as the main sources of information on

the COVID-19 outbreak in our sample, and daily TV and social media exposure time at 2-3 hours

or above was 58.9% and 71%, respectively. The type of media consumed did not differ between

the comparison groups. Also, there was not a significant difference between the comparison

groups with respect to TV and social media exposure times (F (2, 279) = 1.60; p < 0.20, and F (2,

The selection of the independent variables for the ordinal logistic regression analysis

was based on significance from the univariate analyses (p<0.05), interdependency between the

variables, and availability of the data. Among the pre-trauma factors, gender, prior psychiatric

disorder, and the number of past traumatic events were entered into the analysis. The subject’s

view on the seriousness of his/her acute infection, the number of protracted symptoms, the

subject’s view whether the COVID-19 outbreak was a serious threat, social stigmatization after

the infection, and

the adequacy

of

social support were

the peri-trauma factors that were

included. The duration of the acute infectious symptoms was not included, as this variable was

not available for all patients (data lacking for 12.7% of the sample). Acute infectious symptom

burden (# of symptoms) was also excluded, as this variable had a moderate correlation with the

subject’s view on the severity of his/her acute infection (rs = 0.53), another variable which was
included in the analysis. Ordinal categories of PTSD symptom severity (no PTSD, mild PTSD

Overall, female gender, increased number of past traumatic events, a personal view that

PSQI sleep disturbance score.

The logistic regression model was statistically significant, χ2(12) = 48.72, p < 0.001, and

it explained 29.3% (Nagelkerke

R2) of the variance in the persistence of the symptoms. Among

the variables tested, IES-R total score was the sole independent predictor of the persistence of

the symptoms (p<0.001, odds ratio = 1.075 [95% CI, 1.047–1.103]).

4. Discussion

We found that a high percentage of patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 infection

continued

to experience significant

psychological distress, after a mean of almost 50 days

following the diagnosis. Specifically, around a quarter of the patients in our study reported

moderate-to-severe

PTSD

symptoms,

with

over

40%

of

these

subjects

reporting

comorbid

depression. Overall, around one-third of the patients in our study reported clinically significant

PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression.

Around 40% of the patients reported poor sleep quality in the prior month, a quarter

had a sleep duration of 5-6 hours or shorter, and one-fifth had a sleep latency at one hour or

longer. Also, one-tenth of the patients had a positive response to at least one of the items of

the MINI suicidality scale, which may imply also a heightened risk of suicide, although the risk

was ‘low’ in the majority, based on this scale. Finally, one-fifth of the working subjects with

moderate-to-severe PTSD symptoms were still on temporary disability leave at the time of the

survey.

These

findings

indicate

that

a

significant

proportion

of

COVID-19

patients

may

experience psychiatric morbidity in the first few months after the infection. This is in line with

the results of the previous SARS and MERS outbreak research, which reported 10% to 35% of

psychiatric morbidities in the post-illness stage (Lee et al. 2018). While delirium, insomnia, and

symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD have been reported as common features in the

Similarly, Liu et. al. found that ‘moderate-to-severe’ depression

and anxiety were around 10% and 20%, respectively, after about one month following the

hospital discharge. In this study, the prevalence of significant PTSD was 12% (Liu et al. 2020). In

another study, one-third of the patients with COVID-19 infection reported clinically significant

anxiety and/or depression, at a median of 46 days after the virus clearance (Tomasoni et al.

2020).

of

PTSD

It is well

known that females are not only likely to suffer from depressive and anxiety disorders more

frequently, they might also be prone to significant emotional distress and traumatization after

major stressors. Perceived stigmatization generally had been related to negative effects on

mental health, and had a strong impact on the severity of symptoms after traumas (Mak et al.

2007).

In the case of an infectious disease which is highly communicable, and poses a major

threat to the public in general, discrimination perceived by the affected individuals might be

based on reality, as well as a tendency for self-stigmatization.

Another factor predictive of increased PTSD symptoms were the prior traumatic events

reported by the individuals, a finding consistent with the epidemiological studies on PTSD. It is

that the COVID-19 outbreak was a serious threat increased the risk of PTSD symptoms in our

sample. Moreover, subjects’ ratings of the severity of their prior COVID-19 infection (i.e., the

of

acute

symptoms,

duration

of

and

a

non-significant after controlling for the effects of other relevant variables. Interestingly, PTSD

severity was not related with the objective assessment of the prior infection (i.e. infection

sequela in COVID-19.

Preliminary findings suggest that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients continue

to experience persistent symptoms, which may result in significant disability (Carfi et al. 2020,

Townsend et al. 2020). In our sample, one or more protracted symptoms were reported by 44%

of the subjects, with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache, difficulty in

concentration, daytime sleepiness, lightheadedness, and numbness and tingling sensations on

the skin as the most common symptoms. These are in parallel with the findings of previous

studies. Even though the etiology of the persistence of such symptoms is not clear, and this

may be heterogeneous, similar symptoms were reported after the onset of other pandemics. In

the follow-up of SARS survivors, chronic fatigue persisted 40 months after the infection, and

prolonged symptoms and fatigue were present up to 18 months after the MERS infection.

(Moldofsky and Patchai 2011; Lee et al. 2019). Interestingly, the strongest predictor of the

persistent symptoms, in our sample, was the PTSD symptom severity. Overall, the frequency of

moderate-to-severe PTSD in subjects who did not report protracted symptoms was 7.6%, while

this was 35.6% for subjects reporting protracted symptoms. This indicates over 4 times higher

A

of

the

recovered COVID-19 patients.

Clinical similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the protracted symptoms after

SARS and similar outbreaks have been recognized in the previous decades. (Moldofky and

Patcai 2011). Although an ill-defined diagnosis, patients with chronic fatigue syndrome usually

present with debilitating fatigue, and other somatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as

For

instance,

a

twin

registry showed that subjects who reported a history of PTSD were over 8 times more likely to

report a history of chronic fatigue syndrome (Dansie et al. 2012). Also, a preceding trauma

and

shared

by

and

system

markedly

altered

by

severe

and/or

chronic

stressors

(a

preceding

traumatic life event, or an earlier medical problem such as an infection and its treatment) might

be the common pathophysiology for PTSD and chronic fatigue. COVID-19 infection, with its

obvious psychosocial dimensions is an area of investigation which may yield important results

in the future. Further research aiming to uncover the neurobiological, endocrine, and immune

characteristics

related to the protracted symptoms and PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is

clearly warranted.

There are several limitations to our study. First, we used a convenience sample, and

caution

must

be

exercised

in

generalization

of

our

findings

to

the

broader

population

of

patients with COVID-19. In our sample, the great majority of patients (98.8%) were rated as

‘non-critical’ based on the COVID-19 severity index, hence, further work on the most critical

patients is desirable. Second, this was a cross-sectional study which limits our ability to infer

causality. Third, this study depended on self-report of patients instead of a structured clinical

interview which could provide a better picture of the psychological distress in our patients.

Also, a detailed medical examination of the patients with the protracted symptoms could yield

additional clues to the cause(s) of persistence of these symptoms, in addition to the psychiatric

morbidity. Finally, we did not specifically question the symptom of dyspnea in our protracted

symptoms checklist, which may have led to a lower reported frequency of this symptom (4%) in

our sample, compared to other studies.

In summary, patients with COVID-19 are prone to substantial psychological distress after

the infection. PTSD symptoms and comorbid depression, as well as anxiety, and impaired sleep

comprise a substantial part of the distress described by these individuals. Various personal (i.e.,

personal view on seriousness of the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic) are likely to

mediate the mental health effects in the context of COVID-19. The protracted symptoms are

also frequent in this period, and these symptoms are related to the posttraumatic psychiatric

morbidity.
