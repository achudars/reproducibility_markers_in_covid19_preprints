Abstract:
Predicting COVID-19 epidemic development in the upcoming warm season has attracted much
attention in the hope of providing helps to fight the epidemic. It requires weather (environmental)
factors to be included in prediction models, but there are few models to achieve it successfully. In
this study, we proposed a new concept of environmental infection rate (RE), based on floating time
of respiratory droplets in the air and inactivation rate of virus to solve the problem. More than half
of the particles in the droplets can float in the atmosphere for 1-2 hours. The prediction results
showed that high RE values (>3.5) are scattered around 30°N in winter (Dec.-Feb.). As the weather
warms, its distribution area expands and extends to higher latitudes of northern hemisphere,
reaching its maximum in April, and then shrinking northward. These indicated that the spread of
COVID-19 in most parts of the northern hemisphere is expected to decline after Apr., but the risks
in high latitudes will remain high in May. In the south of southern hemisphere, the RE values tend
to subside from Apr. to July. The high modeled RE values up to July, however, suggested that
warmer weather will not stop COVID-19 from spreading. Public health intervention is needed to
overcome the outbreak.
1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has sickened >2.2 million people and killed >0.15 million people in 202 countries
worldwide as of 18 April 2020, and may greatly weaken the global economy5. Numerous studies
on past outbreaks such as influenza6-8 showed that spread of respiratory infectious diseases seems
to be easier at low temperatures and low humidity. So more and more people and governments
hope that warmer weather will slow down or stop the spread of COVID-19. But there is still no
evidence to support it9.
Unlike diseases that rely on insect vectors for transmission, for example malaria10, predicting
human-to-human respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 is somewhat difficult. A key parameter
for model prediction is the basic reproduction rate (R0), which is usually estimated with various
types of complex mathematical models. The R0 value is affected by biological (cell structure11 and
concentrations of virus, immunity of susceptible population, etc), socio-behavioral12,13 and
environmental factors14. Because environmental factors are different in regions and time, it may be
unsuitable for the applicability of R0 outside the region where it was calculated15. Actually, many

studies have found close correlation of epidemic development with environmental factors such as
wind, temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) 6-8, which affects viable virus concentrations and
exposure time of virus to susceptible population. Here, a new reproduction rate that depends on
environmental factors (T and RH), environmental reproduction rate (RE), was introduced. Using RE,
it is possible for us to predict the epidemic development with time (season) and places (countries)
of a specific respiratory disease.
2. Methods
2.1 Estimation of RE.
In the RE estimation, we assumed that there was no individual difference (age and gender) in the
COVID-19 transmission16 because biological structure of SARS-CoV-2 is suitable for infecting all
people11 and SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, almost all people have no immunity to the disease1. The
RE value of COVID-19 can be estimated with effective floating time of respiratory droplets in the
air (tC0) (Fig. 1), the infection period (d i) and a correlation coefficient (β) in the absence of control
measures. The tC0 is a factor that only correlated with meteorological parameters (T and RH) and
half lifetime (t1/2) of active viruses in aerosols.

Figure 1. Infection mode of COVID-19. a. Two ways of infection. New cases (ni-4) and carriers 48
hours before onset (n i-2 and ni-3) are contagious to family members (blue arrows) and susceptible
people (ni) in public places (red arrows). The incubation period and infection period (di) were set
at 4 days23 and 3 days, respectively. b. Conditions for spreading viruses in public places. See
Method Section for more details.
The concentration of viable viruses in droplets at the time t depends on the inactivation rate (α),
which can be described by17

α = e -kt
where k is the rate coefficient of inactivation. When α is 0.5, t is the half lifetime of the virus (t1/2,
min). The half lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 is 1.1 hours18, and then k can be calculated to be 0.0105.
So

α = e -0.0105t
The volume of the droplet air mass changes with air temperature, which will affect the
concentrations of viruses in the air. Using the Ideal Gas Law, the concentration of virus in droplets

(CT) at air temperature T (°C) is

CT =

310.15
C0
273.15 + T

where C0 and 300.15K are the initial concentration of viruses and temperature in the mouth or
nasal cavity. So the concentration (Ct) of viable viruses at the time t is

Ct =

310.15
× e − 0.0105t × C0
273.15 + T

Then the effective floating time (tC0, hours) of virus-bearing droplets with C0 is

In the presence of control measures,

Rd = β × g × tC 0
where g is the proportion of susceptible population; ni is the number of new COVID-19 cases
confirmed at day i; N is the sum of free COVID-19 transmitters confirmed at days i-4, i-3 and i-2
(Fig. 1a, 1b); β (h-1) is the correlation coefficient between g×tC0 and Rd. In the absence of control
measures (g = 1), environmental reproduction rate (RE) can be calculated by

RE = β × tC 0 × d i
where di is the infection period of COVID-19. In the study, di is 3 days. So

RE = 3 × β × tC 0
When RH is less than 50%, the equilibrium particle size (deq) of droplets will not change with
RH (Fig. 2). Therefore, in the mathematical model established, we regarded RH less than 50% as
50%.

3. Results
The RH controls the floating time of respiratory droplets in the air. A longer floating time of
virus-bearing droplets in the air will increase the risk of exposure to the virus. Droplets do not
evaporate completely in the air because they contain substances such as salts and proteins19. The
number of droplet particles at 2-12 microns (μm) ejected during speaking, coughing, sneezing
accounts for more than 90%, and the initial particle size (d0) of the peak number is 7-10μm20 (Fig.
2a). Droplet particles of large size (>100μm) settled rapidly due to gravity. The droplet particles of
small size reached an equilibrium particle size (d eq) rapidly (in a few seconds14,19) and floated in
the air for some time (t) depending on RH (Fig. 2b). When RH is <95%, the main natural weather
conditions, the settling of >90% droplet particles may take more than 5 hours (Fig. 3). For
10-50μm (d0) droplets, the exposure risk under low RH (60%) is more than 20 times larger than
that at RH 100% (Fig. 4). The 7-10μm (d0) droplets, floated in the air for up to 1-2 hours under RH
60%, are the most important vector of virus transmission (Fig. 5a). Here we used the floating time
of 10 μm droplets in the RE estimation. When RH is in the range of 50-100%, the floating time (t,
min) of droplets with initial particle size (d0) of 10μm in the air is a function of RH (Fig. 5a)

People are infected only when the amount of viable viruses exhaled exceeds the minimum
infective dose (MID). The inactivation rate (α) of viruses in aerosols can change concentrations of
viable viruses in the air and then the infection rate. The concentrations of active viruses decreased
exponentially in the air, with a t1/2–related inactivation coefficient (k)19. The t1/2 of SARS-CoV-2 in
aerosols is 1.1 hours20, similar to the floating time of 7-10μm particles in the air under RH 60%
(Fig. 2a), indicating that ~ half of viruses died during settling from the air in dry weather.
The number of new cases and meteorological parameters during the outbreak in Wuhan (WH),
China, have been analyzed, allowing us to fit the tC0 to daily infection rate in public places (Rd). In
the presence of control measures, β×g×tC0 = Rd, where g is the proportion of susceptible
population.
The implementation of control measures for public health intervention in WH includes locking
down the city (January 23), home quarantine (January 23) and gating communities (February 14).
Before January 23, COVID-19 patients were found mainly elderly (>60 years old) and
middle-aged (30-60 years old), each accounting for ~50%21 (Fig. 5b), and mainly associated with

food shopping22. So we believed that half of susceptible population (young and half the
middle-aged) in the city was not involved (g = 0.5). The age structure of cases changed after
January 23. For example, according to the epidemiological survey data in Guangdong and Sichuan
provinces (China)16, among all the 1,836 cases, 1,308 cases were associated with 344 times of
aggregation (1 person infected 3 people), and about 3/4 of the cases confirmed were mainly in the
family. The age structure of the cases is very consistent with the age structure and family member
structure of China and the two provinces (Fig. 5c). Therefore, 3/4 of the susceptible population
were isolated at home during this period, i.e. g = 0.25. After gating communities on February 14,
the number of people who appeared in public places decreased sharply to 1/8 (one person from
one family went out on the second day), and thus g was 0.125 (Fig. 5d). Additionally, in the RE
estimation we increased the g value on some days due to special events, e.g. buying food on
weekends (custom) before locking down the city, outdoor activities on sunny day of January 28
after a long period of rain and a claim on returning to work on February 14 (canceled on February
13) (Fig. 5d).
The tC0 (hour) obtained by running the model (See Method Section) is in good agreement (r =
0.92, p < 0.001) with Rd (Fig. 5e, 5f), meaning that tC0 corresponds to Rd of 2.37 every 1 hour.
According to this, modeled daily infection rate (RE-d) during the entire epidemic in WH averaged
0.93(95% CI: 0.50-1.30). Since the Rd value was calculated with an assumption that di is 3 days,
the RE value then was 2.8, which is equivalent to the reported R0 value3,4. The 3 days of infection
period (di) of COVID-19 are considered based on the reports that COVID-19 patients are
infectious two days before16 and one day after onset of illness (Fig. 1a). The di value is lower than
that reported in ref. 3 (5.2 days). But increasing d i means a decrease in the Rd calculated (Fig. 1b;
See Method Section), so the RE value does not change much with d i. After home quarantine on
January 23, the RE-d averaged 0.25(95% CI: 0.11-0.59) and thus the modeled public infection rate
(RE-p, =RE-d×d i) was 0.75, corresponding to a declined COVID-19 spread by 73%. After gating
communities on February 14, the mean RE-p value dropped to only 0.33, and the disease
diminished considerably by 88% (Fig. 5e), indicating that these control measures are very
effective to prevent the spread of the epidemic. In the estimation, we did not consider family cases
because they were basically isolated at home, and the infection stopped later.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was mainly in China, South Korea, Iran and Italy around 30°N
before March 2020, and spread to almost all parts of the world after March 10 (Fig. 6a). In Europe,
for example, the epicenter was Italy before March. After the 10th day of March, it raged in
Western Europe and began to spread in Northern Europe. Global distribution of RE value modeled
with 10-day averages of T and RH showed a similar trend. In the modeled RE-distribution maps
(Fig. 6b), regions with the RE values higher than 3.5 are scattered in Europe in early March, while
linked together after March 10. This assured us that meteorological conditions in March played an
important role in promoting the rapid spread of COVID-19.

Figure 6. Global COVID-19 epidemic development in different latitudes (see Supplementary
Table S1) (a) and 10-days modeled RE values (b). Dense lines in panel a can indicate concentrated
outbreaks.
The modeled RE value of COVID-19 worldwide ranged between 2.15 and 4.25 (Fig. 7). The low
RE value appears at ocean, and the value on land in temperate zone is generally higher than 2.8
even in July, indicating that warmer weather may not halt the spread of COVID-19 at the stage
when humans have no immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In northern hemisphere, distribution areas with
high modeled RE values (>3.5) are the largest in April and then shrinks to the north. It suggested
that in the region of 30°-60°N where the outbreak was very severe in April, warmer weather was
conducive to slowing the spread of COVID-19 while the risk in Northern Europe, Russia and
Canada is still high in May. In southern hemisphere, regions with high global RE values (>3.3) also
expand northward as air temperature rises. The fall of RE value is the most obvious in East and

Figure 7. Modeled global monthly RE value from Dec. 2019 to July 2020. The estimation from
April to July was based on the mean daytime T and RH of corresponding month in 2019.
In the above RE estimation, except for biological factors (t1/2 and di), we only used
meteorological factors. Although there are large meteorological differences between regions and
dates, even within one day (causing RE differences in a day; Figure 8), today's meteorological
satellites allow easy access to high-resolution weather data. For spread of a specific disease,
therefore, RE is a useful index for global epidemic prediction.

Figure 8. The 3-hourly modeled RE values each day in WH during the epidemic. The blue line
is the average. Shaded region marks the 95% prediction envelop.
The estimation of RE value is under atmospheric static and steady conditions without
considering the influence of wind and airflow turbulence. Wind (>3m/s) is effective at blowing
away aerosols, so it is unlikely to be infected in windy open areas (Fig. 9). Indoor airflow (i.e.
caused by air conditioning and walking) can reduce the floating time of droplets and disperse
viruses in the air, but also significantly increase exposure chance to viruses. Unless the MID of
COVID-19 is small enough, airflow disturbance may not significantly increase the infection rate.
So the modeled RE values may be a upper limit.

Figure 9. Potential ways for droplets to spread the epidemic and risk.
We noticed that the similar half lifetime of SARS-CoV-1 (caused Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome, SARS) to SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols20, so the spread of the two epidemics should be
consistent. But SARS disappeared in the summer of 2003, which was probably due to the

infectivity only after onset of the disease, and thus more controllable than COVID-191, namely,
the di value is lower. This also confirms the importance of the control measures12,13.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we can easily obtain the global RE value of COVID-19 of any time. The
applications in WH and to global epidemic development from Feb. to Apr. are successful, making
it possible to predict the global transmission of COVID-19 in the upcoming summer. Our
estimation showed that warmer weather after April will help slow down the outbreak in the
30°-60°N zone, but the natural extinction of COVID-19 is less likely in summer. Northern Europe,
Russia and Canada should be more alert to spread of the epidemic in May.
