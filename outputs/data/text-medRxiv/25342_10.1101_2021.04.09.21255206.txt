ABSTRACT
The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a
global pandemic that has claimed the lives of millions of people. Genomic surveillance of the virus has proven
to be a critical tool for tracking the emergence and spread of variants with increased transmission or immune
evasion potential. Despite the global distribution of infection, differences in viral genomic surveillance capabilities
between countries and regions have resulted in gaps in our understanding of the viral population dynamics
underlying the pandemic. Nigeria, despite having the largest population of any country in Africa, has had
relatively little SARS-CoV-2 sequence data made publicly available. In this study, we report the whole-genome
sequences of 74 SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from individuals in Oyo State, Nigeria over the first two weeks
of January 2021. Forty-six of the isolates belong to the B.1.1.7 “UK variant” lineage. Comparison to available
regional and global sequences suggest that the B.1.1.7 isolates in Nigeria are primarily monophyletic, possibly
representing a singular successful introduction into the country. The majority of the remaining isolates (17 of 74)
belong to the B.1.525 lineage, which contains multiple spike protein mutations, including the E484K mutation
associated with potential immune escape. Indeed, Nigeria has the highest reported frequency of this lineage
despite its relative rarity worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of the B.1.525 isolates in this study relative to other
local and global isolates suggested a recent origin and rapid expansion of this lineage in Nigeria, with the country
serving as a potential source for this lineage in other outbreaks. These results demonstrate the importance of
genomic surveillance for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in Nigeria and in other undersampled
regions across the globe.

INTRODUCTION
A little over a year after its emergence in the Hubei province of China, the continued spread of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the globe has sparked a worldwide health crisis (13). Despite the relatively low mutation rate of this virus, its high prevalence in the human population globally has
allowed it to diversify quickly (4, 5). Identification and tracking of these mutations through whole genome
sequencing efforts have been critical to identifying routes of transmission, mapping outbreaks across
communities over time, and characterizing new variants that may change the virological or clinical aspects of the
disease (6-9). For example, during the spring and summer of 2020, a novel mutation in the viral Spike protein,
D614G, was identified in association with higher viral loads in patient upper airways (10, 11). The rapid expansion
of this variant in diverse communities across the world coupled with virological assays in vitro and in vivo, suggest
that this variant is more transmissible (12-15). Indeed, this mutation is nearly fixed in the SARS-CoV-2 population
today (11).
Continued surveillance efforts have since identified a number of ‘variants of concern’ that have been associated
with rapid expansion in their local communities and spread to other countries. Using the Pangolin nomenclature,
these include the B.1.1.7 lineage originally identified in the United Kingdom, the B.1.351 variant originally
identified in South Africa, and the P.1 and P.2 variants originally identified in Brazil (16-21). The first concern is
that these viruses may prove to be more transmissible and could render current public health standards less
effective at containing spread of the virus (22-24). The second is that changes to the viral Spike protein may
render current formulations of the vaccine less efficacious and/or confer increased capacity for re-infection (2527).

Finally, viral mutations may impact the effectiveness of therapeutic monoclonocal antibodies(28).

Addressing these concerns requires continued surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity worldwide.
While many countries have developed extensive genetic surveillance and reporting systems, several regions
across the globe remain critically undersampled (29). For example, several countries in Africa have reported
only a handful of sequences relative to their cumulative case counts (30, 31). This need is even more acute
given the recent emergence of several variants of global concern. Significantly, Nigeria, which has the highest
total population in the continent, has only a small number of reported SARS-CoV-2 sequences, limiting our
understanding of the viral population structure in the country and continent. Through mid-February of 2021, the
majority of the approximately 300 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences publicly available from Nigeria have been
generated through the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Disease (ACEGID), which also
serves other African countries (www.acegid.org). However, given Nigeria’s status as an epicenter of commerce
and travel in Africa, undetected expansion of a more infectious, virulent or immune-escape variant in Nigeria will
have major repercussions for the entire continent. More consistent and higher volume of sample collection and
sequencing is required in Nigeria to strengthen the public health value of serosurveillance.

To better understand the current SARS-CoV-2 population structure in Nigeria and add samples to this region,
we set out to perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses originating in Oyo state, Nigeria. SARSCoV-2 whole genome sequencing was performed on 74 nasopharyngeal specimens collected from COVID-19
patients in Oyo state in January 2021. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two primary lineages of virus circulating
in the region: B.1.1.7 (i.e., the ‘U.K. variant’) and B.1.525, an emerging variant of interest. Both lineages are
relatively monophyletic, suggesting singular introductions sometime in the fall of 2020. These data help to fill in
a significant gap in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Nigeria and identify two lineages of note currently
dominating the epidemic in the region.
RESULTS
Specimen characteristics
We obtained 80 specimens from COVID-19 patients in Oyo state, Nigeria collected between January 2 and
January 14, 2021. These specimens consisted of residual nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs that tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) diagnostic testing in the
Biorepository and Clinical Virology Laboratory at the University College Hospital College of Medicine at
University of Ibadan. The qRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of these specimens obtained in the clinical
laboratory for N gene using either DaAn Gene or BGI detection kits ranged from 13.46 to 33.11 and 18.51 to
37.10 for ORF1ab when using DaAn gene kit. The average age of the patients was 42 years (range [11-84]) and
the gender distribution was 50% female and 50% male. RNA was extracted from each sample and the level of
viral RNA was recertified by one-step qRT-PCR (CDC assay, RNaseP and N1 primer set)(32). Samples with
high quality RNA (RNaseP Ct value >35) and sufficient viral RNA for whole genome sequencing (N1 Ct value
<32) were reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was subsequently
amplified by multiplex PCR using the ARTIC protocol (primer set version 3) and deep sequenced on the Illumina
platform (33, 34). The minimum threshold for base calling was 10 reads with 90% coverage required to report
the whole genome sequence. Of the 80 specimens, 6 failed to yield a final consensus sequence due to
insufficient genetic material, insufficient purity after barcoding, or inadequate read coverage after sequencing;
these samples were excluded from further analysis. The final 74 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were
deposited in the publicly available GISAID database (Supplemental Table 1) and subjected to phylogenetic
analysis (35, 36).
The two dominant lineages in Oyo state are the lineage of concern B.1.1.7 and the novel lineage of interest
B.1.525.
We first performed phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis of the 74
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in this study using IQ-Tree v2.0.5. The dates of sample collection were subsequently
integrated to build a temporal tree using TreeTime v0.7.6 (Figure 1). Most of the specimens from Oyo state
(88%) belonged to one of two main clusters with very strong support at their base nodes (support: >97% aLRT
and >97% UFboot). We used the Pangolin method of classification to identify the lineages of the clusters

observed. The most abundant lineage (46 out of 74 sequences) was B.1.1.7. This lineage of concern is
associated with the Spike N501Y mutation and was first identified in the U.K. in the fall of 2020 (20). The second
most common lineage (17 of 74 sequences) was a lineage of interest, designated B.1.525. This lineage contains
the Spike E484K, Q677H, and F888L mutations as well as three in-frame deletions shared with B.1.1.7, including
Spike 69-70del (cov-lineages.org). The remaining sequences all belonged to other common B.1.1 lineages,
except for 2 sequences from lineage A. Viruses from lineage A viruses spread throughout the world early in the
pandemic, but are now relatively rare globally, accounting for only 0.3% of isolates collected in January 2021
(nextstrain.org).
Comparison with other publicly available Nigerian isolate sequences
To better determine if these sequences in Oyo state were representative of Nigeria as a whole, we downloaded
all available sequences sourced from Nigeria in the GISAID database as of February 14th (266 sequences). We
followed the same approach as above and performed ML phylogenetic reconstruction to estimate the
evolutionary relationships with the other available sequences. We also performed ancestral reconstruction of the
most likely sequences at internal nodes as well as at transition points between geographical locations to better
examine relationships between the isolates found in different states in Nigeria. This analysis confirmed a
distribution of the viral populations throughout the country similar to what was observed in Oyo state. Of all
recently reported sequences (January 1, 2021 – February 14, 2021), we observe that 68% of the sequences
belong to the B.1.1.7 lineage while 17% belong to the B.1.525 lineage (Figure 2). This includes sequences from
Lagos state, Osun state, Abuja, and other sequences from Oyo state collected outside this study. Overall, this
result suggests that the distribution of lineages observed in this study is broadly relective of the recent distribution
of lineages in Nigeria. It furthermore confirms the recent increase in prevalence of these two lineages in Nigeria,
the emergence of which coincided with an increase in overall case count (37).
Nigerian viral populations compared to global sequences and B.1.1.7 analysis
To better understand these data in the context of the global epidemic, we selected 4000 randomly sampled
global sequences from GISAID and repeated these analyses. We confirmed the clustering of the lineages as
observed above (Figure 3). Furthermore, these data reveal a monophyletic clade of most of the B.1.1.7 lineage
sequences in Nigeria, suggesting either a single successful introduction and outbreak of this specific B.1.1.7
sub-cluster or multiple, closely linked introductions compatible with the observed founder effect, i.e. introduction
of a subset of mutations and decrease in lineage diversity as observed in B.1.1.7 sequences in Nigeria. To
confirm the B.1.1.7 sub-clustering in Nigeria, we performed a ML phylogenetic reconstruction of all B.1.1.7
sequences obtained in this study alongside 4000 randomly sampled B.1.1.7 sequences from across the globe
(Figure 4). Additionally, we performed Bayesian inference of all B.1.1.7 sequences available from Nigeria with
a smaller set of 500 randomly sampled Global B.1.1.7 sequences (Figure 5). These analyses both confirmed
strong support for a monophyletic sub-cluster that included almost the entirety of the B.1.1.7 sequences from
this study. Given these results, we estimated a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for this
B.1.1.7 sub-cluster of October 28, 2020 [95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval: October 16 - November

3, 2020]. Together, these results suggest that the expansion and dominance of B.1.1.7 in Nigeria can be traced
back to a single introduction or multiple, closely timed introductions in the fall of 2020.
Analysis of the recently identified B.1.525 lineage in Nigeria
We also completed a detailed analysis of the second most prevalent lineage observed in our dataset, B.1.525.
This lineage is not highly prevalent on the global scale but was recently defined as a lineage of international
significance (38). At the time of this analysis, only 159 sequences were available in GISAID from this lineage,
17 coming from this dataset. As of February 2021, Nigeria had highest frequency of the B.1.525 lineage in any
country worldwide, accounting for roughly 25% of sequences (38). Referring to our previous ML analysis of the
sequences from Oyo state alongside 4000 randomly selected global sequences (Figure 3), we observe strong
support for a monophyletic clade of the B.1.525 lineage in Nigeria, suggestive of a single introduction followed
by rapid expansion (Figure 3). Using a Bayesian approach, we next analyzed all 159 B.1.525 sequences
available in GISAID alongside a smaller subset of B.1 sequences to help root the tree (the only 2 B.1 sequences
present in our dataset and 10 randomly selected from GISAID). The estimated TMRCA was October 27, 2020
[95% HPD interval: September 27 - November 21, 2020], similar to the TMRCA estimated for the B.1.1.7 lineage.
This analysis suggests that this lineage may have expanded principally in Nigeria, making this country the most
likely source of a majority of sequences observed elsewhere in the world (Figure 6). That being said, we cannot
conclude that the B.1.525 lineage originated in Nigeria due to low sampling and the observation that two
sequences from Spain root outside of the node with the most statistical support corresponding to TMRCA for the
B.1.525 lineage in Nigeria. In sum, our analyses are all consistent with a single introduction or multiple, closely
linked introductions of both the B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages into Nigeria in the fall of 2020. These introductions
were followed by expansion of each population to become the predominant two lineages in the country by early
2021.
No significant differences are observed in the Ct values of the diagnostic PCR tests by clade
Finally, we tested for differences in the viral load observed at diagnosis, as represented by cycle threshold (Ct)
value, by viral lineage. Using a linear model to control for patient age and gender, we compared the Ct value
measured for the N1 probe for all 74 diagnostic specimens batched by lineage (Figure 7). We did not observe
any statistically significant differences between the two main lineages (B.1.1.7 and B.1.525), and the remaining
lineages lacked sufficient representation for meaningful comparison. Although a larger dataset that controls for
more confounders will be needed to robustly test for differences, this result suggests there are comparable
average viral loads in the upper respiratory tract between these two lineages at the time of patient diagnosis.
DISCUSSION
Together, these results indicate the dominance of two distinct viral populations in Oyo state and in Nigeria more
broadly. The B.1.1.7 lineage, which was first reported on December 21, 2020 in the U.K. and first sampled on
September 20, 2020, appears to have become dominant within Oyo state and throughout the other sampled

states in Nigeria by early January 2021. While this variant of concern has not been found to influence efficacy of
neutralizing antibodies produced upon vaccination, it has been suggested to be more transmissible and can
interfere with diagnostic tests probing over the Spike deletion (20, 39-41). These data should be considered in
updating the diagnostic and prevention strategies in Nigeria. More broadly, these data increase the call for
international guidance on establishing public health policy for countries with high prevalence of variants.
Another significant observation of this study is the previously unreported increase of the B.1.525 lineage in
Nigeria. The prevalence of the B.1.525 lineage in Nigeria was the highest observed in any country, with
phylodynamic data suggesting Nigeria may have served as the origin for several outbreaks of this lineage.
Critically, this lineage contains the Spike E484K mutation, which some studies have suggested may impact
immune recognition and vaccine efficacy (42-47). It is imperative to monitor this lineage and better understand
its impact on vaccine response as vaccination expands in Nigeria and across the region.
While these analyses suggest both lineages arose from either singular or multiple, closely linked introductions
to Nigeria, overall lack of sampling across this region remains a significant confounder and more data will be
needed to further test these hypotheses. Comparing the estimated TMRCA for both lineages with the daily
incidence reported by the NCDC (Figure 8), we note that the possible introduction or appearance of these
lineages coincides with some of the lowest daily incidence numbers since the beginning of the pandemic. This
observation suggests the possibility that both lineages benefited from founder-effects that boosted overall
prevalence of each as case numbers rose. Less than a month prior to the estimated TMRCA for these lineages,
Nigeria reopened international airports to regular air traffic (September 5, 2020). This step was accompanied by
strong measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 importation, including requiring a negative PCR test within 96 hours
of boarding an in-bound flight, screening for COVID-19 symptoms prior to boarding the flight, self-quarantine for
7 days after arrival in Nigeria, and a mandatory second PCR test on day 7 of arrival. Despite these rigorous
public health measures, these data are suggestive of a model wherein these lineages were seeded from
international travel followed by local expansion.
The successful introduction and/or spread of these lineages in a period of very low incidence, together with their
possible fitness advantages, could have facilitated the observed dominance of these lineages in Nigeria. Due to
the suggested higher infectivity rate of B.1.1.7 and suggested decreased antibody elicited neutralization capacity
against E484K variants, it is possible that these lineages could be in part responsible for the significant increase
of daily incidence observed in Nigeria in late 2020. That being said, cases increased significantly across the
globe regardless of variant prevalence, suggesting additional factors are at play, such as increased socialization
at the end of the year. Furthermore, the introduction of these linegaes at a time of low prevelenace will likely
have contributed to their expansion through founder effect. Regardless, additional sequencing and surveillance
across the region, and elucidation of their biological and clinical significance, will be required to better understand
and cope with emerging variants on the global scale.

METHODS
Viral RNA extraction
Viral RNA was extracted from clinical specimens utilizing the QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, cat. no. 52906).
Clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 presence was performed by quantitative reverse transcription and PCR (qRTPCR) with the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel utilizing the N1 probe in SARS-CoV-2 and RP probes
for sample quality control as previously described (IDT, cat. no. 10006713). All specimens that failed to amplify
the RP housekeeping gene were excluded from this study. All specimens with an N1 probe cycle threshold (Ct)
less than or equal to 35 were considered positive and included in this study. RT-PCR was repeated in a random
selection of specimens to validate Ct values obtained by the clinical diagnostic laboratory. Ct values from the N1
probes were used in all subsequent analyses.
cDNA synthesis and viral genome amplification
cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript IV First Strand Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 18091050)
using 11 μl of extracted viral nucleic acids and random hexamers according to manufacturer's specifications.
Direct amplification of the viral genome cDNA was performed in multiplexed PCR reactions to generate ~400 bp
amplicons tiled across the genome. The multiplex primer set, comprised of two non-overlapping primer pools,
was created using Primal Scheme and provided by the Artic Network (version 3 release). PCR amplification was
carried out using Q5 Hot Start HF Taq Polymerase (NEB, cat. no. M0493L) with 5 μl of cDNA in a 25 μl reaction
volume. A two-step PCR program was used with an initial step of 98 °C for 30 s, then 35 cycles of 98 °C for 15
s followed by five minutes at 64 °C. Separate reactions were carried out for each primer pool and validated by
agarose gel electrophoresis alongside negative controls. Each reaction set included positive and negative
amplification controls and was performed in a space physically separated for pre- and post-PCR processing
steps to reduce contamination. Amplicon sets for each genome were pooled prior to sequencing library
preparation.
Sequencing library preparation, Illumina sequencing, and Genome Assembly
Sequencing library preparation of genome amplicon pools was performed using the SeqWell plexWell 384 kit
per manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled libraries of up to 96 genomes were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq
using the V2 500 cycle kit. Sequencing reads were trimmed to remove adapters and low quality sequences using
Trimmomatic v0.36. Trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (accession
MN908947.3) using bwa v0.7.15. Pileups were generated from the alignment using samtools v1.9 and
consensus sequence determined using iVar v1.2.2 (ref PMID: 30621750) with a minimum depth of 10, a
minimum base quality score of 20, and a consensus frequency threshold of 0 (i.e. majority base as the
consensus).

Phylogenetic analysis
Genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.453 software and manually edited using MEGA v6.06. All
Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenies were inferred with IQ-Tree v2.0.5 using its ModelFinder function before
each analysis to estimate the nucleotide substitution model best-fitted for each dataset by means of Bayesian
information criterion (BIC). We assessed the tree topology for each phylogeny both with the Shimodaira–
Hasegawa approximate likelihood-ratio test (SH-aLRT) and with ultrafast bootstrap (UFboot) with 1000 replicates
each. TreeTime v0.7.6 was used for the assessment of root-to-tip correlation, the estimation of time scaled
phylogenies and ancestral reconstruction of most likely sequences of internal nodes of the tree and transitions
between geographical locations along branches. TreeTime was run using an autocorrelated molecular clock
under a skyline coalescent tree prior. We used the sampling dates of the sequences to estimate the evolutionary
rates and determine the best rooting of the tree using root-to-tip regression with least-squares method.
Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analyses were performed for the phylogenies of B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages
separately using a smaller set (for computational time reasons) of of 500 randomly sampled global sequences
from GISAID for B.1.1.7 and all the available sequences for B.1.525. Due to the small number of B.1.525
sequences available, we included B.1 sequences from our Nigerian dataset as well as 10 random B.1 sequences
from GISAID to help root the phylogenies. We used BEAST v2.5.2 to estimate the date and location of the most
recent common ancestors (MRCA) as well as to estimate the rate of evolution of the virus. BEAST priors were
introduced with BEAUTI v2.5.2 including an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal
distribution of the evolutionary rate, previous estimated evolutionary rates (8x10-4) as the prior for the mean,
and a standard deviation of 0.1 after optimization with preliminary runs. We assumed a GTR substitution model
with invariant sites, as the best-fitted model obtained with ModelFinder, and a Coalescence Bayesian Skyline to
model the population size changes through time. The posterior evolutionary rate was estimated to be 5.9x10-4
for the B.1.1.7 inference and 7.9x10-4 for the B.1.525 analysis (that included B.1 lineages). All the analyses
indicated support for a relaxed clock as the average rate coefficient of variation was 0.2 for B.1.1.7 and 0.6 for
B.1.525, which indicates a degree of rate autocorrelation among adjacent branches in the tree. Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs of at least 100 million states with sampling every 5,000 steps were computed. The
convergence of MCMC chains was monitored using Tracer v.1.7.1, ensuring that the effective sample size (ESS)
values were greater than 200 for each parameter estimated.

Figure 1. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Oyo state. a) ML phylogenetic tree of 74 SARSCoV-2 specimen genomes in Oyo state collected between January 2 and January 14, 2021. All non-zero
statistical support values for each branch are indicated. Lineages of interest are indicated and colored. Midpoint
rooting was used for representation purposes. b) Distribution of the different pangolin lineages found in the Oyo
dataset reported here.
Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis of Oyo state isolates compared to all available Nigerian sequences. ML
phylogenetic temporal reconstruction of full genome sequences from Nigeria, including the sequences from this
study and all sequences available from Nigeria in GISAID as of February 14th, 2021. Clades corresponding to
B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages are indicated. Branches and tips are colored by state; labels corresponding to
sequences obtained in this study are colored in red.

from GISAID as of February 14th, 2021. Clades corresponding to B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages are indicated.
Branches and tips are colored by country.
Figure 4. Phylogenetic analysis of Oyo state B.1.1.7 sequences compared to global B.1.1.7 sequences.
ML phylogenetic temporal reconstruction of full genome B.1.1.7 sequences obtained in this study and 4000
randomly sampled B..1.1.7 global sequences from GISAID as of February 14th, 2021. Branches and tips are
colored by country.
Figure 5. Phylodynamic tree of Nigeria B.1.1.7 sequences compared to global B.1.1.7 sequences.
Maximum clade credibility tree where branch colors represent the most probable geographical location of their
descendent node inferred through Bayesian reconstruction of the ancestral state. All full genome B.1.1.7
sequences from Nigeria and 500 randomly sampled B.1.1.7 global sequences from GISAID as of February 14th,
2021 were included in the analysis. The width of the node circles represents their posterior probability.
Figure 6. Phylodynamic tree of the entire B.1.525 lineage. Maximum clade credibility tree where branch
colors represent the most probable geographical location of their descendent node inferred through Bayesian
reconstruction of the ancestral state. All full genome B.1.525 sequences from this study and from GISAID as of
February 14th, 2021 were included in the analysis. We included two B.1 lineage sequences from Nigeria and 10
randomly sampled from GISAID to help root the phylogenies. The branch that leads to the node that represents
the B.1.525 MRCA is indicated. The width of the node circles represents their posterior probability.
Figure 7. PCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values of patient diagnostic samples grouped by pangolin lineage
assignment. Ct values for the N1 probe set reported at the time of diagnosis were compared between lineage.
A linear model was fitted to test for differences in Ct value between lineages. All possible contrasts within the
model were performed and corrected for multiple comparisons using Tukey's test. No corrected p-values were
found to be statistically significant using 0.05 cut-off.
Figure 8. Daily SARS-CoV2 Incidence in Nigeria. Confirmed new cases in Nigeria obtained from Johns
Hopkins University Coronavirus resource center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). The TMRCA (solid line) and 95%
High Probability Density (HPD) (dashed lines) in Nigeria of B.1.1.7 and B.1.525 lineages estimated using
Bayesian methods is indicated.
