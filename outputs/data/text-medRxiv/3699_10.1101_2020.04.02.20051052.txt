Abstract
Background: Globally, the novel coronavirus, is a public health problem causing respiratory
infections. Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes
coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion
with growing number of cases and deaths.
Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework. In this
scoping review, 50 records published before 28 March, 2020 were included and discussed to
better understand the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological response, diagnosis,
evasion mechanisms and suggested strategies to boost immune system, challenges, treatment,
and future preventions of the virus. PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Global Health and google
scholars were searched comprehensively for articles, preprints, grey literatures, reports, websites,
conference proceedings and expert information. Studies conducted in human and published in
English language were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements of the review
regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in citations.
Results: We identified 360 records, of which 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. We
synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled
into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of
asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of
awareness.
Conclusions and recommendations: Due to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the
prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and
socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects,
using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing hand-washing practices,
avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and
prevention.
Keywords: Burden, Challenges, COVD-19, Epidemiology, impact, pathogenesis, prevention

Introduction
Globally, the novel coronavirus is (COVID-19), is an emerging pandemic disease causing
respiratory syndrome that needs urgent attention1. It was not reported to cause human disease
until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) occurred early in 2003,
which infected about 8000 persons, with a case fatality of 9.5%2, Followed by Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) from 2012-2015, which infected about 2500 persons
worldwide and a case fatality rate of 35%2,3. COVID-19, is a new strain that has not been
identified among humans4 and now become an epidemic proportion with growing number of
cases rapidly from December 2019 to 571,678 globally, with 26,495 deaths as of 28 March
20205.
COVID-19 is a viral infection in the family of coronaviridae. The family includes viruses which
are a positive sense, enveloped, non-segmented RNA virus in the genus of beta coronavirus with
zoonotic origin first described in 1931 whereby first isolated from humans in 1960s1. The novel
coronavirus, previously designated 2019-nCoV, was identified as the cause of a cluster of
pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China at 31 December 2019. On 31 December 2019, the first four
cases of an acute respiratory syndrome with unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan City,
China among people linked to a local seafood market1, 3. From 31 December 2019 through 3
January 2020, a total of 44 case-patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported to
WHO from China. Within one month the outbreak spreaded to 19 countries with a total of 11,
791 confirmed cases and 213 deaths4, 5.
After the declaration of COVID-19 as global public health emergency6, about 118 598 confirmed
cases were reported from more than 100 countries6, 7. Currently, COVID-19 is affecting 199
countries and 2 territories named the Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Japan, and the Holland
America’s MS Zaandam) with a total of 571,678 confirmed cases, 26,494 deaths and 142,474
recovered cases was reported as of 28 March 2020 20208. As per the previous studies reports
median age of COVID-19 cases was 59 years (15 to 89 years) with the majority being male7. The
average incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 4.8±2.6, ranging from 2 to 11 days9,
10

.

The outbreak has distributed throughout the globe. WHO and national guidelines have endorsed
preventive strategies to the current outbreak. However, the current prevention and control

strategies of COVID-19 is facing challenges. Hence, we conducted this scoping review to assess
the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological response, diagnosis, evasion
mechanisms and suggested strategies to boost immune system, challenges, and future
preventions.
Methods
Methodological framework
We used the following methodological framework to conduct this scoping review. (1)
Identification review question (2), Developing review objectives, (3) Developing search strategy
and identification of search sources, (4) Screening records and data extraction and (5) Setting
eligibility criteria.
Search strategy and searching sources
A search strategy was developed using specific key concepts in our research question:
“epidemiology of COVID-19”, “burden of COVID-19”, “pathogenesis of COVID-19”, “COVID
and immune system”, “diagnosis of COVID-19”, “immune invading and evasion mechanisms”,
“current preventions and treatment strategies of COVID-19” and “challenges to the current
strategies and future preventions”. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Cochrane, Global
Health and google scholars. To avoid missing relevant studies we included preprints and grey
literatures using BioRxiv, MedRxiv, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention websites, conference proceedings and expert information.
Study selection and data extraction
After the literature search, all the references were imported to Zotero. Four researchers (BB, HD,
HL and HN) independently screened studies for eligibility and relevance. A fifth researcher (GA)
was consulted for discrepancies. We resolved differences in opinion through discussion.
Eligibility criteria
Articles, reports, preprints, expert opinions, and information from websites conducted among
human participants, published in English language, and briefly showing the data regarding the
current outbreak COVID-19 were included.

Results and discussion
Characteristics of the included studies and reports
Most of the records were retrieved from WHO, CDC reports, Global health, and websites. Out of
the 50 included articles (Figure 1) more than half were reports and expert opinions.
Three months Global burden of COVID-19 in terms of total confirmed cases and deaths
The confirmed cases of COVID-19 are increasing from time to time. In the first two months the
number of cases were higher among countries in the West pacific Asian region than other
regions where the lowest cases were reported in Africa. And later as of March 2020 the number
of cases was observed to be exponentially increased among countries in the European, American,
and Eastern Mediterranean regions (Figure 2).
Furthermore, the reports of death were predominant in the Western Pacific Asian region in
January and February 2020. However, the reported deaths outnumbered among countries in
European region by March 2020 (Figure 3).
Pathogenesis and clinical syndrome of COVID 19
Individuals infected with COVID-19 presented with early symptom of high fever (390c),
headache and abnormal respiratory findings such as cough, and difficult breathing. The virus
might pass through the mucous membranes, especially nasal and larynx mucosa then enters the
lungs through the respiratory tract11. After the virus reach in the lung it spreads to peripheral
blood, causing viremia. Then the virus would adhere and express to the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), of the organs like lungs, heart, renal, gastrointestinal tract. Patients infected
with the virus have higher number of leukocytes, increased plasma pro-inflammatory
cytokines12-14. The main pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection as a respiratory system targeting
virus was severe pneumonia, viremia, combined with the incidence of ground-glass opacities,
and acute cardiac injury15.
Host immune response to COVID-19
The immune system is responsible for the controlling, resolution and immunopathogenesis of
CoV infections. The immune response is due to receptor recognition between the pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Usually,
Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 sense viral RNA and DNA in the
endosome16,

17

. The most important recognition mechanisms of viral RNA are viral RNA

receptor (retinoic-acid inducible gene I), cytosolic receptor (melanoma differentiation-associated
gene 5) and nucleotide transferase cyclic GMP-AMP synthase18,

19

. This complex signaling

recruit adaptors, including TLR-domain-containing adaptor protein, mitochondrial antiviralsignaling protein20 and stimulator of interferon genes protein21 to trigger downstream cascade
molecules. This will also be involved in adaptor molecule MyD88 and lead to the activation of
the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and interferon regulatory factor 3 and the production of
type I Interferons and a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines22. Hence, virus-cell interactions
produce a diverse set of immune mediators against the invading virus23.
Innate immunity
To mount an antiviral response, innate immune cells need to recognize the invasion of the
COVID-19. The recognition is through PAMPs and PRRs. In the innate immunity there is
activation and regulation of immune system to eliminate the virus, otherwise results in
immunopathology. A few plasma cytokines and chemokines like IL-1, IL-2, IL- 4, IL-7, IL-10,
IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, GCSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α,
hepatocyte growth factor, IFN-γ and TNF-α were observed higher among COVID-19 infected
individuals24-26. COVID-19 causes an inflammatory response in the lower airway and led to lung
injury to produce cytokine storm in the body, which may be associated with the critical condition
among COVID-19 infected individuals27.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, early high rise in the serum levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines were observed in SARS-CoV-228, suggesting a potential similar cytokine stormmediated disease severity of COVID-19 infection29,

30

. Effective innate immune response

involves the action of interferon responses and its downstream cascade that culminates in
controlling viral replication and induction of effective adaptive immune response sharing the
same attachment receptor with SARS-CoV31. The recognition site is present in subset of lung
cells called type 2 alveolar cells14.
Adaptive immune response
Unlike the other corona viruses, a limited serology details of COVID-19 were reported. In a
previous study, peak IgM antibodies were observed after day 9 of disease onset. additionally,
sera from 5 patients of confirmed COVID-19 showed some cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV.

Furthermore, antibodies were observed to be neutralized by COVID-19 in an in vitro plaque
assay, suggesting a possible successful mounting of the humoral responses14.
Another study reported that CD8+ T cell responses were frequently observed than CD4+ T cell
response. Generally, the virus specific T cells were the central memory phenotypes with a
significantly higher frequency of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells (IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-2) and
CD8+ T cells (IFNγ and TNFα). Having considered few controversial issues, strong T cell
response was correlated significantly with higher neutralizing antibody while more serum TH2
cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10)32.
Immune Evasion Mechanisms
Current observations indicate that coronaviruses are particularly adapted to evade immune
detection and dampen human immune responses. This partly explains why they tend to have a
longer incubation period, 2-11 days than other viral infections33. The longer incubation period is
probably due to their immune evasion properties. Hence the viral antigen can escape host
immune detection at the early stage. The immune evasion mechanism is potentially like SARSCoV and MERS-CoV. The other immune escaping mechanism is inhibition of innate immune
responses, inhibition of interferon recognition and signaling, immune modulation including
membrane or nonstructural proteins (NS4a, NS4b, NS15), Viral mutations, Immune exhaustion,
Immune deviation: TH2 bias34-36. Furthermore, in the adaptive immune response the evasion
mechanism is due to down regulation of antigen presentation via MHC class I and MHC class II.
Whenever, macrophages or dendritic cells get infected with MERS-CoV, T cells activation will
be markedly diminished37.
Suggested strategies to boost our immune system
In the presence of controversial ideas between immune system and COVID-19, some scientist
and reports suggested that taking items listed below are some supplements to trigger the immune
system38, 39.
•

Reducing stress: Stress have negative impact the production of lymphocytes. As stress
increase the risk of viral disease increases.

•

Exercise: Regular exercise promotes cardiovascular health, lowers blood pressure, helps
control body weight, and offers protection against diseases. Exercise also improves blood

circulation, allowing immune system cells to move through the body more freely and do
their job more effectively. However, intensive exercise can cause inflammation in the
body that boosts undesired immune response.
•

Eat a balanced diet with fruits and vegetables: Previous evidence suggested that lack
of these nutrients can alter the immune response.

•

Avoid smoking: Smoking tobacco leads to susceptibility to infection and lower the
protective nature of the immune system.

•

Get enough sleep: Studies showed that people who get an optimal sleep (sleeping 7-8
hours for adults and up to 10 hours for children and teenagers) are less likely to be at risk
of viral infections.

•

Supplements: Such as Vitamin C and D, Zinc and Garlic may improve the function of white
blood cells that fights infection.

Transmission, laboratory diagnosis and current treatment
Transmission: the virus has two main transmissions, zoonotic transmission like outbreak of
SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012/201540 and anthroponotic, via direct contact or
through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual and it is more
contagious than other viruses. Moreover, there is no evidence of congenital transmission for
COVID-1911.
Laboratory diagnosis
The following laboratory diagnostic techniques are used to detect COVID-1941-43.
•

Viral nucleic acid test: Is the routine confirmation test for COVID-19 based on
detecting a unique sequence that shows presence or absence of the virus.

•

Serological testing: Used for outbreak investigation.

•

Viral sequencing: After the virus is detected by nucleic acid test viral sequencing is
important for monitoring genome mutation.

•

Viral culture: It is not routine test but used for further investigation.

•

Hematological test: Is supportive test to the routine tests for screening the distribution of
cells.

•

Chest CT Scan: It aids as supportive diagnostic method to show pneumonia. This test
should be considered to confirm COVID-19 when we are under investigating of this
virus.

•

Blood oxygen saturation test: This test also uncommon and not routinely applied as
confirmatory test rather used as further investigation of the virus42.

Current treatment
Neither an effective vaccines nor anti-viral therapeutic agents is approved to treat COVID-19.
Hence, we mostly focus on supportive care. Rapid public health interventions with antibodies,
anti-viral or novel vaccine strategies are highly essential. Passive antibody therapy is considered
to limit COVID-19 epidemics which can recognize epitope regions in the foreign virus particle
and reduce the virus replication and disease severity44, 45. Although there is no specific treatment,
some reports recommended that using some anti-bacterial or anti-malaria and antiviral drugs are
important as pre or shortly after the onset of the virus as prophylaxis to reduce infectiousness to
others by reducing viral shedding in the respiratory secretions44. Some of the prophylactic drugs
are listed below.
Azithromycin: This antibacterial drug is acts by down regulate inflammatory responses and
reduce the excessive cytokine production associated with respiratory viral infections45.
Chloroquine: this anti malaria drug also acts by inhibition of viral enzymes or processes such as
viral DNA and RNA polymerase, viral protein glycosylation, virus assembly, new virus particle
transport, and virus release. It also involves ACE2 cellular receptor inhibition, acidification at the
surface of the cell membrane inhibiting fusion of the virus, and immunomodulation of cytokine
release.
Lopinavir and Ritonavir: these ant viral drugs are acts by bind to Mpro, a key enzyme for
coronavirus replication46.
Alpha interferon: as immunomodulation as adjuvant treatment47.
Acetaminophen: it considered as temperature control48.
Serum therapy: The use of monoclonal antibodies with serum therapy and intravenous
immunoglobulins preparations as passive immunization46,

49

. This can be achieved by using

peptide fusion inhibitors, anti SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, anti-angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and protease inhibitors. The spike protein present on the viral membrane

plays a vital role in virus entry and is the principal antigenic component responsible for inducing
host immune response47-50.
Economical and psychological impact of COVID 19:
Following the index case of COVID-19 infected individual in China by December 2019 it started
to spread to the rest of the world. It is then declared as pandemic outbreak by WHO. Since the
declaration of the outbreak it leads to several economical and psychological problems in the
world. Some of the impacts include disruption of the global chain supply due to the closing their
boarder, slowdown of the investment, loss of revenue due to debt, increment in health spending
cost, shortage of food and drugs, decrement of business travel and tightening domestic financial
markets51, 52. Besides this, the outbreak of the disease leads to psychological trauma like fears,
sadness, anxiety, and depression of the people on how to manage the disease during the hard
time53.
Risk groups: Individuals with Obesity, Cardiovascular disease, Respiratory diseases like
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis, Seasonal
allergies/Toxic Mold exposure, Dysbiosis, Auto-immune diseases, Fibromyalgia, Neurodegenerative disease, Cancer, Fatty Liver, Biotoxin illness and diabetes are highly susceptible to
COVID-19 due to depleted cell membranes54.
To minimize the risk factors reports suggested that cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in home
and in areas that people touch the most is effective. Following the same preventive measures as
people went out. Contact healthcare providers whenever developed signs and symptoms of
COVID-19. Furthermore, individuals are requested to limit shared spaces, when having guests
and keeping recommended social distancing55.
Challenges and future prevention of COVID 19
Challenges: The challenges for the effective controlling of COVID-19 outbreak include absence
validated vaccine and treatment56,57, ability of the viral antigen to stay longer in the air, sociocultural behaviour of people, lack of awareness, viral capacity of staying in animate objective for
weeks58, overcrowding environment, having asymptomatic carriers, unavailability of test kits61,
having wide host range57, lack of readiness to follow the recommended social distancing,
difficulty of interpreting social distancing,

unknown infective dose, unknown degree of

infectivity prior the onset of clinical manifestation and after recovery.

Future preventions and recommendations
At government level: International, National, regional governments should participate by
allocating budget for training, isolation of suspects, testing and supportive cares and awareness
creation.
At health institutions: Health institutions should also screen and early detection, giving
supportive care and treatment, distributing medical protective equipment, give health education
and introducing hand washing practices to customers and preparing isolation rooms60.
At community level: Creating community awareness on the transmission and early prevention,
active case detection, distribution and preparing hand washing jars, utilization of hand sanitizers
and respirators61, avoiding over-crowding60, avoiding intimate contact with animals59 and
applying hand glove to protect touching different contaminates60 should be practiced.
At churches and University levels: Minimizing conferences and Sunday schools, avoiding
movement along different places, avoid lecturing in classes and replace with alternative lecture
methods, posting different posters that thought about the outbreak, preparing and distributing
hand washing jars for the university community at the entry and exit and empowering the
community on the usefulness of social distancing and on hand washing practices.
For upcoming researchers: As per the fast spreading outbreak of COVID-19 infection
researchers should develop validated vaccine and treatment. If in case delay unenviable,
substances that boost the immune response is recommended.
