Key Points
Question: What is the serologic response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in hemodialysis
patients?
Findings: In this prospective observational study, humoral response was compared in 66
hemodialysis patients sampled 28 days after receipt of one dose of vaccine to 76 patients who
received two doses of vaccine sampled 14 days after the second dose. Among those receiving
one dose, 6% had anti-RBD response above the median level of convalescent serum versus 41%
who received two doses.
Meaning: Given that hemodialysis patients exhibit a poor humoral response to a single dose of
BNT162b2 vaccine, the second dose should not be delayed.

Abstract
Importance: Hemodialysis patients have an exceptionally high mortality from COVID-19 and
this patient population often has a poor response to vaccinations. Randomized controlled trials
for COVID-19 vaccines included few patients with kidney disease, therefore vaccine
immunogenicity is uncertain in this population.
Objective: Evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in chronic hemodialysis patients
following one versus two doses of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination compared to health care
worker controls and convalescent serum.
Design: Prospective observational cohort study.
Setting: Single centre study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Participants: 142 in-centre hemodialysis patients and 35 health care worker controls.
Exposure: BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine.
Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to the spike protein (anti-spike),
receptor binding domain (anti-RBD), and nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) were measured in 66
hemodialysis patients receiving one vaccine dose following a public health policy change, 76
patients receiving two vaccine doses, and 35 health care workers receiving two vaccine doses.
Results: Detectable anti-NP suggestive of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 15/142
(11%) of patients at baseline while only three patients had prior RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19.
Two additional patients contracted COVID-19 after receiving two doses of vaccine. In patients
receiving a single BNT162b2 dose, seroconversion occurred in 53/66 (80%) for anti-spike and
35/66 (55%) for anti-RBD by 28 days post dose, but only 15/66 (23%) and 4/66 (6%),
respectively attained a robust response as defined by reaching the median level of anti-spike and
anti-RBD in convalescent serum from COVID-19 survivors. In patients receiving two doses of

BNT162b2 vaccine, seroconversion occurred in 69/72 (96%) for anti-spike and 63/72 (88%) for
anti-RBD by 2 weeks following the second dose while 52/72 (72%) and 43/76 (41%) reached the
median convalescent serum level of anti-spike and anti-RBD, respectively. In contrast, 35/35
(100%) of health care workers exceeded the median level of anti-spike and anti-RBD found in
convalescent serum 2-4 weeks after the second dose.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study confirms poor immunogenicity 28 days following a
single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in the hemodialysis population, supporting adherence to
recommended vaccination schedules, and avoiding delay of the second dose in these at-risk
individuals.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in a devastating global pandemic. Among
those most severely affected are patients on maintenance hemodialysis who must visit facilities
at least thrice weekly for life sustaining treatment resulting in a five times greater risk for
infection than the general population.1 Despite adherence to public health guidance, outbreaks
have occurred in dialysis units.2 Further, patients on dialysis are at greater risk for severe
COVID-19, with 63% of chronic dialysis patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and
a case fatality rate of 29% in Ontario, Canada.1 Confirmatory data from the US Renal Data
System found mortality among hemodialysis patients in early 2020 was 16-37% higher than in
2017-2019.3
Dialysis patients frequently have diminished immune response to vaccination compared
with the general population, as observed during hepatitis B vaccination.4 Studies of natural
COVID-19 infection in dialysis patients found waning antibody concentrations by three months,
raising the possibility that dialysis patients may not develop an adequate vaccination response.5
Finally, randomized controlled trials for the BNT162b2 vaccine included few patients with
kidney disease.6 Therefore data on vaccine immunogenicity are lacking in this high-risk
population.
Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were administered 21 days apart in randomized
controlled trials. However, due to vaccine shortages, countries including the United Kingdom
and Canada have prioritized first dose vaccination of the general population,7 while delaying the
second dose for up to 3-4 months, offering a natural experiment for comparison of one versus
two doses. To investigate the humoral response conferred by COVID-19 vaccination in the

Study Design and Methods
In-centre hemodialysis patients age ≥18 years, including those with prior COVID-19,
were eligible for this single centre prospective observational study to evaluate SARS-CoV-2
antibody response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech). Recruitment of 142
participants occurred between February 2, 2021 and March 3, 2021 at Sunnybrook Health
Sciences Centre. A subset of patients (n=76) received two dose vaccination with the second dose
a mean of 21 days (range 19-28) following first dose, while 66 patients received a single vaccine
dose due to a policy change. In the two-dose group, baseline was prior to second dose and
antibody levels were collected weekly until 14 days post second vaccine dose. In those receiving
a single vaccine dose, antibody levels were measured at baseline prior to vaccination and 28 days
following the first dose. A written questionnaire captured vaccination-related adverse events.
Health care worker (HCW) controls received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine with antibodies
measured 2-4 weeks following second dose. This study was approved by the Sunnybrook Health
Sciences and Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Antibodies targeting the full-length spike protein (anti-spike) and its Receptor Binding
Domain (anti-RBD) measured humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and/or natural
infection while antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) detected natural SARS-CoV-2
infection, as this antigen is not targeted by the BNT162b2 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies
were measured on a custom automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform;
the sensitivity and specificity of each assay was determined by precision-recall analysis from
pre-COVID negative and convalescent controls.8,9 Antibody levels were reported as relative
ratios to a synthetic standard included as a calibration curve on each assay plate. Thresholds for

positivity (seroconversion) were determined by aggregating data from negative controls and
calculating the mean + 3 standard deviations. Relative antibody levels were also compared to the
median levels of convalescent serum taken 21-115 days post symptom onset in patients with
COVID 19; expression of vaccination-induced antibody levels to convalescent individuals helps
to define correlates of protection.10 The association between reactogenicity following second
vaccine dose and the proportion of patients with anti-spike or anti-RBD seroconversion two
weeks following second dose was assessed by a Chi-Squared test.

Results
Among 142/157 (90%) consenting in-centre hemodialysis patients, the median age was
72 years and 48/142 (34%) were female (Table 1). At baseline, 15/142 (11%) of patients had
detectable anti-NP of whom 3/142 (2%) patients had RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19.
Characteristics of patients receiving one versus two vaccine doses were similar. HCW controls
had a median age of 46, 33/35 (94%) were female, and 3/35 (9%) had prior COVID-19.
In 66 patients receiving one vaccine dose, four weeks following the first vaccination,
53/66 (80%) of the patients seroconverted, but only 15/66 (23%) had anti-spike antibodies
exceeding the median relative ratio of convalescent individuals (Table 2). In the 76 patients
receiving two vaccine doses, the first dose similarly elicited anti-spike seroconversion in 65/76
(86%) with 19/76 (25%) reaching convalescent levels 28 days post dose. The second vaccine
dose, however, induced a more robust response increase with 43/76 (57%) reaching convalescent
levels by one week further increasing to 52/72 (72%) by 2 weeks with 69/72 (96%) reaching
seroconversion (Figure 1).
The same overall trends were more pronounced for antibodies to RBD, which are well
correlated with neutralizing antibodies.9,11 The first vaccine dose elicited a poor anti-RBD
response with seroconversion of 36/66 (55%) in the one dose group and 31/76 (41%) in the two
dose group. After one dose, only 4/66 (6%) in the one dose group and 10/76 (13%) in the twodose group reached convalescent serum levels. However, one week after the second dose of
vaccine, 58/76 (76%) of the individuals had seroconverted, with 31/76 (41%) having antibody
levels above the median of convalescent serum. Two weeks after second dose of vaccine, 63/72
(88%) seroconverted and 43/72 (60%) were above convalescent serum. In HCW controls, 100%

reached the convalescent levels for both anti-spike and anti-RBD 2-4 weeks after two doses.
Results were similar when individuals with baseline anti-NP seroconversion were excluded
(eTables 1-2 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
The presence of reactogenicity was associated with anti-RBD seroconversion (p<0.001)
but not anti-spike seroconversion. Two patients contracted COVID-19 following two doses of
vaccine despite both having an anti-RBD antibody response above convalescent serum levels
prior to anti-NP seroconversion. Both patients were hospitalized, but did not experience severe
disease.

Discussion
This prospective serology study found that while high rates of seroconversion were
observed, consistent with other studies in hemodialysis patients,12 a robust anti-RBD response
defined as reaching convalescent serum levels was seen in less than 10% of patients 28 days after
a single dose. In contrast, two weeks after the second dose, 60% of hemodialysis patients had
anti-RBD antibodies levels comparable to those achieved by infected patients. Anti-RBD
response was lower than anti-spike response, which is of importance as anti-RBD may better
correlate with viral neutralization.9 While our study did not evaluate cell-mediated immunity, a
good anti-RBD response is required for adequate cell-mediated response.13 Interestingly, we
found that symptoms following the second vaccine dose were associated with anti-RBD
seroconversion and may help identify patients who develop some protection.
The response to the second dose, however, was notably weaker than in the HCW controls
wherein 100% generated robust anti-RBD antibodies. This finding is similar to other
compromised populations. In Canada, patients with malignancy and solid organ transplant
receive two doses per manufacturer guidelines as studies demonstrating poor humoral response
to one dose vaccination led to policy changes.14,15 With widespread global vaccine shortages, it is
critical that we identify vulnerable populations. This study confirms a poor humoral response
following a single dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients, and
demonstrates the critical importance of the second dose, which should not be delayed in this
vulnerable population.

a
Seroconversion threshold represents a positive test and are 0.19, 0.186, and 0.396 for anti-spike, anti-RDB, anti-NP antibodies
respectively.
b
The median level of antigen in convalescent serum taken 21-115 days post-symptom onset is considered a robust antibody
response and are 1.38,1.25, and 1.13 for anti-spike, anti-RBD, and anti-NP antibodies respectively.

Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 IgG Spike, RBD, and NP Antibody Response Following One
Versus Two Dose BNT162b2 Vaccine in Hemodialysis Patients.
Antibody levels are reported as relative ratios to synthetic standards. The samples are grouped into two cohorts who received one
(n=66) or two doses (n=76) of vaccine. Dots represent individual serum samples collected at the indicated times, and the samples
from the same patients are connected by lines. Green dots indicate individuals with prior RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Seroconversion threshold represents a positive test and are 0.19, 0.186, and 0.396 for anti-spike, anti-RDB, anti-NP antibodies,
respectively. The median level of antigen in convalescent serum taken 21-115 days post-symptom onset is considered a robust
antibody response and is 1.38, 1.25, and 1.13 for anti-spike, anti-RBD, and anti-NP antibodies, respectively. Healthy control workers
(n=35) received two doses of vaccines with serologic measurement 2-4 weeks following dose 2. Abbreviations: HCW, health care
worker; NP, nucleocapsid protein; RBD, receptor binding domain.
