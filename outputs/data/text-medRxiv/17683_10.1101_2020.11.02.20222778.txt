Abstract
Background: Immune correlates of protection from COVID-19 are important, but incompletely
understood.
Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2,826 participants working in hospitals and
Fire and Police services in England, UK during the pandemic(ISRCTN5660922). Of these, 2,672
were unselected volunteers recruited irrespective of previous SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results, and
154 others were recruited separately specifically because they previously tested positive. At
recruitment in June 2020, we measured numbers of interferon-γ secreting, SARS-CoV-2 responsive T
cells using T-SPOT® Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kits (Oxford Immunotec Ltd), and antibodies to SARSCoV-2 proteins using commercial immunoassays. We then described time to microbiologically
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, stratified by immunological parameters.
Results: T cells responsive to the spike (S), nuclear (N) and membrane proteins (M) dominated the
responses measured. Using the sum of the spots (responsive cells within each well of 250,000
peripheral blood mononuclear cells) for S, N and M antigens minus the control, the 2,672 unselected
participants were divided into those with higher responses (n=669, 25.4%; median 30 spots (IQR
18,54)) and those with low responses (n=2016, 76.7%, median 3 (IQR 1,6)), the cutoff we derived
being 12 spots. Of the participants with higher T cell responses, 367 (53%) had detectable antibodies
against the N or S proteins. During a median of 118 days follow-up, 20 participants with lower T cell
responses developed COVID-19, compared with none in the population with high T cell responses
(log-rank test, p=6x10-3).
Conclusions: Peripheral blood SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell numbers are associated with risk of
developing COVID-19.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic that has killed over a million individuals,
disrupted economies, and continues to spread widely; to date, over 590,000 confirmed cases have
occurred in the UK alone. Disease manifestations vary from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic
infection through to fatal pneumonia (1-4). Why some individuals develop severe disease when
others are asymptomatically infected remains unclear, with immune protection being one explanation.
Animal data indicate that immune protection to SARS-CoV-2 diseases can be elicited, as does limited
human epidemiological data (5-11), but such immunity may not prevent infection (12) and high attack
rates of clinical illness in closed-community outbreaks suggest such protection is neither absolute nor
widespread (5, 13). One potential protective mechanism involves antibody generation. Antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike protein are generated in >90% of cases of symptomatic
infection (Table S1), but in asymptomatically infected individuals generation of SARS-CoV-2
responsive T cells without antibodies has been reported (14, 15). Additionally, SARS-CoV-2
responsive T cells have been described in a proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 naive population, likely
primed by infection with the endemic common cold Coronaviridae (CCCs) (16-19). It has been
proposed, but not proven, that these T cells may provide some protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection
(20).
To date, T cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been studied in smaller studies in research
settings (e.g. (14-19)) using advanced but bespoke flow cytometric approaches. By contrast,
reproducible, standardised high throughput serological assays which have minimal cross reactivity
with CCCs have been developed (21, 22), and deployed on a large scale, even before a complete
picture of their utility emerges (23).
The objective of this study was to describe T cell and antibody responses to the SARS-COV-2 virus
in 2,847 UK keyworkers recruited to the EDSAB-HOME (Evaluating Detection of SARS-CoV-2
AntiBodies at HOME) cohort study (25), measuring the association between COVID-19 development
and T-cell and serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 at recruitment. To do so, we used T-SPOT®
Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kits (T-SPOT hereafter), which use ELISpot technology to detect IFN-γ
release from immune cells after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. The test is similar to the widely
deployed T-SPOT®.TB test, which identifies patients infected with M. tuberculosis (24).

Methods

Study participants
We studied participants in the EDSAB-HOME study (ISRCTN56609224) (25), which recruited and
characterised three keyworker ”streams”. Two streams (Streams A, B) recruited Fire & Rescue or
Police service keyworkers, or Health care keyworkers (n=1,139, n=1,533 respectively), independent
of any history of COVID-19 disease, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, or RT-PCR test results; in
Stream C, healthcare workers were purposefully recruited on the basis of a history of prior RT-PCR
positive testing (n=154) (Table S2). The cohorts did not include acutely infected individuals; among
the 268 (9.4%) cases who had had a prior positive RT-PCR result, the test had occurred a median of
63 days prior to recruitment. On attending a study clinic, participants provided 6ml blood
anticoagulated using EDTA used for immunoassays, and 6ml or 10ml lithium heparin anticoagulated
blood used for T-SPOT tests. Recruitment occurred in June 2020.

Study endpoints
In the period after recruitment, large scale SARS-CoV-2 testing capability was in place in England.
For participants, symptom driven nasal/throat RT-PCR testing was available through state and
employer routes for those with cough, fever, or disordered taste/smell; all such tests, irrespective of
result, are recorded in a national database. Asymptomatic testing was not available, except as part of
national surveillance schemes. We followed up participants, defining an endpoint as having a SARSCoV-2 positive RT-PCR test. Follow-up was possible for all participants, with endpoints ascertained
by nationaL database searches. Because the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is normally less than
14 days, we started follow-up 14 days after the recruitment clinic visit, to avoid inclusion of individuals
who may have developed immune responses prior to symptom recognition. Additionally, results
obtained from any individuals tested as part of national surveillance studies of randomly selected
asymptomatic individuals were excluded, since the positive predictive value of results is much lower in
the absence of symptoms(26). More detail is in Supplementary Materials.

T-SPOT® Discovery SARS-CoV-2 kits
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a whole blood sample using the TCell SelectTM reagent (Oxford Immunotec). After quantification and dilution of recovered cells,

250,000 PBMCs were plated into each well of a T-SPOT® Discovery SARS-CoV-2 (Oxford
Immunotec) kit. The kit is designed to measure responses to six different but overlapping peptides
pools to cover protein sequences of six different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, without HLA restriction, and
includes negative and positive controls. Peptide sequences that showed high homology to endemic
coronaviruses were removed from the sequences, but sequences that may have homology to SARSCoV-1 were retained. Cells were incubated and interferon-γ secreting T cells detected.

Laboratory Immunoassays
We characterised serological responses against SARS-CoV-2 using two commercial immunoassays:
Roche Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2 (21), and EUROIMMUN anti-S IgG immunoassays (25). We
considered assays positive if the Roche Elecsys® immunoassay signal was over 1.0, or the
EUROIMMUN immunoassay index was over the negative cut-off of 0.8 (25).

Masking
None of the individuals who ran the laboratory immunoassays, either serological or T-SPOT, had
access to any information about the samples. Participants were made aware of their EUROIMMUN
serological results approximately one month after their clinic visit, with a warning this was not
indicative of protection from disease. Participants were not informed of their Roche or T-SPOT
results.
All analyses used R 4.0.2 for Windows. See also Supplementary Material for more details.

Ethics
EDSAB-HOME study was approved by NHS Research Ethics Committee (Health Research Authority,
IRAS 284980) on 02-Jun-2020 and PHE Research Ethics and Governance Group (REGG, NR0198)
on 21-May-2020. All participants gave written informed consent.

Statistics
To explore and depict individuals’ multi-dimensional immunological results (T-SPOT counts to six
pools of peptides; immunoassay results), we performed hierarchical clustering, displaying results as
heatmaps.

To depict associations between immunological and clinical metadata (see Table S2), we computed
correlation coefficients ρ, regarding ρ different from 0 if the associated p value was less than 0.01,
adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method, depicting correlations as heatmaps.
To compare T-SPOT responses in groups of individuals, we used Wilcoxon Ranked-sign tests.
To analyse the T-SPOT result of individuals, we computed the sum of T-SPOT responses to groups
of panels, subtracting the background (see Table S3). To divide individuals based on T-SPOT
results, we identified a subgroup of cases with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection before study recruitment
(PCR positive, Stream C, n=154), and a subgroup at low risk of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before
recruitment (n=1,126; see Supp. Methods Fig. S4, and results). We computed a cutoff from the TSPOT result optimally separating these two populations as described by Youden’s method (27). This
cutoff was derived prior to 29-Sept-2020 when follow-up data was first examined.
To determine whether T-SPOT results or serostatus was associated with protection from COVID-19,
we compared time-to-event (see ‘Study Endpoints’ above), stratifying by dichotomised immunological
measures (seropositive/negative; high vs low SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell numbers). We tested for
differences using log- rank tests. We also estimated hazard ratios, adjusting for serostatus, using
Cox Proportional Hazards models with profile penalised likelihood confidence intervals(28) (R coxphf
package).

Results

T cell responses in the general population
We performed SARS-CoV-2 serology and T-SPOT testing on 2,867 key workers (Figure 1). In
14/2,867 (0.5%) of cases, T-SPOT tests failed due to raised background. Among the 2,826 (98.5%)
participants in whom complete T-SPOT and immunoassay results were available for analysis (Figure
1), we observed T cells responding to a range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the vast majority of
seropositive individuals, while similar responses were also observed in a proportion of seronegative
individuals (Figure 2).
There were positive correlations between T-SPOT responses to Spike S1, S2 domains, Membrane
and Nucleoproteins (r ~= 0.6) and between Envelope and structural protein responses and other viral
components (r ~= 0.4) (Supp. Materials, Fig. S1). In view of this, we analysed the sum of T-SPOT
responses to Spike, Membrane and Nucleoprotein (T-SPOT SNM results, see Methods) and the sum
of T-SPOT Envelope and Structural protein responses (T-SPOT ES results) in further analyses. In
Streams A and B, comprising keyworkers recruited without any requirement for previous RT-PCR
testing, including 114 individuals with proven past infection (Figure 1), 478/2,826 (16.7%) of the
population were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Figure 3 depicts T-SPOT SNM results vs. anti-S
immunoassay results; depiction vs. anti-N immunoassay results is similar (Fig. S2). Participants who
were seropositive had higher T-SPOT SNM results than individuals who were seronegative (median
-12

28 (IQR: 15,52.5) vs. 3 (1,7) spots per 250,000 PBMC; Wilcoxon test, p < 10 ). We also observed
high T-SPOT SNM results associated with seropositivity (median 47.5, (25.5, 72.5)) in a separate
cohort (Stream C) comprising only cases of previously confirmed infection (Figure S3). This suggests
T-SPOT SNM responses are generated, along with specific antibody, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
contrast with T-SPOT SNM results, T-SPOT ES results were in general much lower and differed little
between seronegative (median (IQR) 1, (0,3)) and seropositive individuals (median (IQR) 1, (0,3)),
suggesting durable responses against these components of the T-SPOT kit were not induced by
natural infection.

T cell responses differ in individuals with and without prior SARS-CoV-2
infection
We examined T-SPOT SNM results in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and in those
without. Because the T-SPOT test uses fresh cells, we did not have the option of analysing prepandemic material. We identified a cohort of 1,126 individuals from Streams A, B whom we
considered to have a low risk of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they reported no personal or
household symptoms compatible with COVID-19 since January 2020, and were seronegative (Figure
S4). We compared this low risk cohort with 154 individuals known to have been infected, based on
previous PCR positivity (Stream C members) (Fig. S4, S5). T-SPOT SNM results differentiate these
populations with area under curves of 0.96, and an optimal cutpoint based on Youden index(27) of 12
cells per 250,000 cells (Figure S6A). By contrast, T-SPOT ES results do not differentiate these
populations (Figure S6B). We refer to the participants with T-SPOT SNM results above vs. below this
exploratory cutoff as having ‘Higher T-SPOT SNM’ vs. ‘Lower T-SPOT SNM’ results going forward.

COVID-19 symptom history is correlated with T-SPOT results only in
seropositive individuals
We observed seronegative individuals with higher T-SPOT SNM results: in Streams A and B,
283/2197 (12.9%) participants fell into this category. Among the 2,672 Stream A&B keyworkers, we
noted T-SPOT SNM results and serological results were significantly associated with wellcharacterised COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, muscle aching, fatigue, and with abnormal sense
of taste and smell in both the individual and in their household (Figure 4A). Importantly, this effect is
driven entirely by seropositive individuals; restricting analysis to the 2,197 seronegative individuals,
we observed no significant associations, either positive or negative, between T-SPOT SNM results
and self-reported symptoms (Figure 4B).
From an alternative analysis, we reached similar conclusions. Analysing dichotomised T-SPOT SNM
results, we observed higher T-SPOT SNM results in 665/2672 (24.8%) of keyworkers, including
377/475 (79.4%) of seropositive individuals and 283/2197 of (12.9%) seronegative individuals. We
identified 24 clinical features significantly associated with seropositivity in univariate analyses (Table
S6). However, in the 2,197 person seronegative subset, none of the risk factors for seropositivity

were positively correlated with higher T-SPOT SNM results (Table S6). Not only were COVID-19
compatible symptoms not significantly associated with higher T-SPOT SNM results in seronegative
participants, neither were other SARS-CoV-2 exposure-associated risk factors including health care
worker occupation and household COVID-19 disease (Table S6). There was one shared risk factor,
age, but the direction of the effect differed. While older seropositive individuals have higher T-SPOT
-4

SNM results than younger subjects (p < 10 , Wilcoxon test), the opposite is true in seronegative
populations: in under 30s who were seronegative, 21.7% had higher T-SPOT SNM results; in 60+
adults, this had reduced to just 5.9% (association with age, p <10-4) (Fig. S7).

Higher T-SPOT SNM results are associated with decreased COVID-19 risk
We followed up all participants until 18-10-2020, a median of 118 days. 20 (0.71%) participants
developed the endpoint (SARS-COV-2 test positive COVID-19 disease), all of whom were
seronegative and had lower T-SPOT SNM results (Figure 5, Fig. S8). COVID-19 development is
more common in individuals with lower T-SPOT SNM results (hazard ratio (HR) 30.0 (2.53, 178000),
p=0.001; log-rank p=0.007). This effect persisted after adjustment for serostatus (adjusted HR 13.5
(1.05,83000), p=0.04). Restricting to seronegative individuals, a similar estimate was obtained (HR
12.2 (1.03, 72300), p=0.046); log-rank p=0.08. The association of low T cell SARS-CoV-2 numbers
with having positive RT-PCR tests is specific to positive results; similar associations were not
observed when having a test, as opposed to testing positive, was considered (Fig. S9).

Discussion
About 25% (669/2,672) unselected UK keyworker volunteers had elevated levels of SARS-CoV-2 S,
N, and M protein responsive T cells, when using a cutoff of 12 spots per 250,000 PBMC. Of these
25%, only 55% (367/669) were seropositive using either one of two sensitive SARS-CoV-2 specific
immunoassays. The other 45% lack both risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and detectable
antibodies against the N or S antigens; they most likely harbour SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells
primed by CCCs, rather than SARS-CoV-2 (16-19). The absence of epidemiological risk factors for
SARS-CoV-2 in this population argues against, but does not completely exclude, an alternative
scenario involving T cell priming by minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection without antibody
generation/ persistence (14, 15). While our findings are compatible with flow cytometric studies
identifying interferon-γ secreting SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells (16-19), the study’s much larger scale
allows us to demonstrate that high levels of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells are associated with
protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least over the time period studied. A potential
bias involving seropositive participants being tested less (perhaps because they believed they were
immune) does not explain this effect. We did not observe COVID-19 in seropositive individuals, but
note a protective association of having higher T-SPOT SNM results in seronegative populations,
questioning whether seropositivity might appear protective in part because seropositivity is commonly
associated with high SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cell numbers.
There are several limitations. First, numbers of individuals developing illness during follow-up remain
small at present, with about 0.7% of those followed up developing illness. While disease acquisition
is associated with T-SPOT SNM results (p=0.007), we cannot precisely quantify the T cell number /
protection relationship. The 12 spot cutoff used here was selected since it discriminates individuals at
low risk of SARS-CoV-2 from those with proven past COVID-19 disease, but it is not necessarily
optimally predictive of disease risk going forward. We plan on publishing updated analyses as case
numbers rise which may help address this, while also permitting co-modelling of disease risk using
clinical COVID-19 risk factors (e.g. age, ethnicity (1-4)). Secondly, we counted circulating SARSCoV-2 responsive interferon-γ secreting cells, but did not phenotype them (16), and so may have
missed prognostic immunophenotypes and mucosally restricted T-cell populations. Finally, we only

measured symptomatic COVID-19 infection; we did not investigate asymptomatic infection (which
may be important for transmission, and over which immune control is at present uncertain (20)).
We considered potential confounders of the association we observed. Participants knew their
symptom history and antibody status; seropositive or previously symptomatic participants may have
been more likely to allow themselves to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Secondly, some individuals
may have been infected without being tested (and acquired protection) subsequent to the clinic visits.
Thirdly, individuals at the highest risk of occupational exposure on follow-up may have been at
highest risk of having been infected prior to recruitment. Importantly, all these biases would be
expected to dilute any immunology/protection association.
Overall, this study suggests that serology may underestimate the working age population at lower risk
of clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection, something which might impact outbreak kinetics (29) and which has
been suspected on epidemiological grounds (30). We would speculate that the declining number of
individuals with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 responsive T cells with increasing age may explain higher
illness incidence and severity in older age (1-4). Intriguingly, our data indicate individual level risk
stratification may be possible using T-cell assays, including the standardised assay kits used in this
study which, being in the same format as the widely used T-SPOT®.TB tests for latent TB infection,
would be readily deployable at scale (24).

Correlation matrices showing the relationship between individual or household self reported
symptoms, T cell numbers and immunoassay results in (A) 2,672 individuals from Streams A,B (B)
2,197 seronegative individuals. Clustering was performed independently in the two datasets. The
order of the columns minimises differences between individuals. Only statistically significant
correlations are shown. Colour scale reflects Spearman’s correlation coefficient, ρ. In (A), the box
denotes a correlation between various immune parameters and symptoms. Comparable correlations
are not seen if symptomatic individuals are excluded (B). Serological data is not included in (B) as in
(B) all individuals are seronegative.
