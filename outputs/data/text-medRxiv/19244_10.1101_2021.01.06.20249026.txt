Summary
Background: Uruguay is one of the few countries in the Americas that successfully
contained the COVID-19 epidemic during the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, the
intensive human mobility across the dry border with Brazil is a major challenge for
public health authorities. We aimed to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strains
detected in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil as well as to measure the viral flux
across this ~1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier.
Methods: Using complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Uruguayan-Brazilian
bordering region and phylogeographic analyses, we inferred the virus dissemination
frequency between Brazil and Uruguay and characterized local outbreak dynamics
during the first months (May-July) of the pandemic.
Findings: Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2
Brazilian lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 into Uruguayan localities at the bordering
region. The most probable sources of viral strains introduced to Uruguay were the
Southeast Brazilian region and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Some of the viral strains
introduced in Uruguayan border localities between early May and mid-July were able to
locally spread and originated the first outbreaks detected outside the metropolitan
region. The viral lineages responsible for Uruguayan suburban outbreaks were defined
by a set of between four and 11 mutations (synonymous and non-synonymous) respect
to the ancestral B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses that arose in Brazil, supporting the notion
of a rapid genetic differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations spreading in
South America.
Interpretation: Although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to nonUruguayan citizens, the inevitable flow of people across the dry border with Brazil
allowed the repeated entry of the virus into Uruguay and the subsequent emergence of
local outbreaks in Uruguayan border localities. Implementation of coordinated binational surveillance systems are crucial to achieve an efficient control of the SARSCoV-2 spread across this kind of highly permeable borderland regions around the
world.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative
agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was first detected in South America on
February 26, 2020, it has rapidly spread through the region, causing nearly 350,000
deaths by December, 2020. In contrast to most American countries, Uruguay avoided an
early exponential growth of SARS-CoV-2 cases and during the first six months of the
pandemic it registered the lowest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths among
South American countries. The intensive cross-border human mobility through the
~1,100 km uninterrupted dry frontier between Uruguay and Brazil, might poses a major
challenge for long-term control of the epidemic in Uruguay. Previous genomic studies
conducted in Uruguay have analyzed sequences mostly sampled at the capital city,
Montevideo, and detected prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages different from those
described in Brazil, thus finding no evidence of frequent viral exchanges between these
countries.
Added value of this study
Here we present the first genomic study of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in different
Uruguayan and Brazilian localities along the bordering region. The samples analyzed
include 30% (n = 59) of all laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases from Uruguayan
departments at the Brazilian border between March and July, 2020, as well as 68 SARSCoV-2 sequences from individuals diagnosed in the southernmost Brazilian state of Rio
Grande do Sul between March and August, 2020. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2
viral lineages that widely spread in the Southeastern Brazilian region (B.1.1.28 and
B.1.1.33) were also responsible for most viral infections in Rio Grande do Sul and
neighboring Uruguayan localities. We further uncover that major outbreaks detected in
Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil in May and June, 2020, were originated from two
independent introduction events of the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.33, unlike
previous outbreaks in the Uruguayan metropolitan region that were seeded by European
SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings confirm that although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed
to non-Uruguayan citizens, dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 across the UruguayanBrazilian frontier was not fully suppressed and had the potential to ignite local
transmission chains in Uruguay. These findings also highlight the relevance of
implementing bi-national public health cooperation workforces combining
epidemiologic and genomic data to monitor the viral spread throughout this kind of
highly permeable dry frontiers around the world.

INTRODUCTION
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of
coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), was first reported in South America on February
26, 2020, and rapidly spread through the region. South America is actually the second
worst affected region in the world, with more than 11 million SARS-CoV-2 cases and
nearly 350,000 deaths confirmed as of December, 20201. While the virus exponentially
spread during the first half of 2020 in most South American countries, the rapid
implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions avoided an exponential growth of
SARS-CoV-2 cases in Uruguay2,3. Six months after the first four cases were reported on
March 13, 2020, the country registered the lowest total and per capita numbers of
SARS-CoV-2 cases (1,808 cases, 520 cases/million inhabitants) and deaths (45 deaths,
13 deaths/million inhabitants) in the region4.
Despite Uruguay's success to control the early expansion of SARS-CoV-2, the intensive
cross-border human mobility between Uruguay and neighboring countries heavily
affected by the pandemic, is a major concern for public health authorities, aimed to
achieve long-term epidemic control. With an area of approximately 176,000 km² and
3.5 million inhabitants, Uruguay borders with Argentina to its west and southwest and
with Brazil to its north and east. Of particular concern is the border with Brazil, a
porous ~1,100-kilometers strip of land that separates the southernmost Brazilian state of
Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and the Uruguayan departments of Artigas (AR), Rivera (RI),
Cerro Largo (CL), Treinta y Tres (TT) and Rocha (RO). The Brazilian-Uruguayan
border hosts about 170,000 people that live in twin cities located both sides of a dry
border and that maintain an intense economic and social interdependence5.
With a total area of about 282,000 km² and 11.3 million inhabitants, RS is the fifthmost-populous Brazilian state and as of July 31, 2020, registered 66,692 SARS-CoV-2

cases and 1,876 deaths6. After an initial phase of relatively slow growth, the COVID-19
epidemic displayed a sharp increase in RS since early May that coincides with the
detection of several outbreaks along Uruguayan border departments. The largest SARSCoV-2 Uruguayan outbreaks (~50-100 confirmed cases) outside the metropolitan region
during the first months after the first detected cases in the country, were at RI and TT
departments in May and June, respectively, while smaller outbreaks (~10-20 confirmed
cases) were detected in AR and CL by July7. As of July 31, 2020, a total of 201 SARSCoV-2 cases were reported in Uruguayan municipalities located along the border with
Brazil, which represents 16% of the laboratory-confirmed cases in the country7.
Previous phylogenetic analyses revealed the circulation of different predominant SARSCoV-2 lineages in Brazil (B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33)8,9 and Uruguay (A.5 and B.1)10,11 thus
supporting independent viral seeding events and little viral exchanges between these
neighboring countries during the very early phase of the epidemic. However, most
Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 samples previously analyzed were from Montevideo, the
capital city of the country and there is only scarce information concerning the virus
strains circulating in Uruguayan localities bordering Brazil
We generated 122 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences recovered from cases
isolated at Uruguayan border departments (n = 54) as well as in the southernmost
Brazilian state of RS (n = 68) to gain insight into the origin and dynamics of SARSCoV-2 spread at the Brazilian-Uruguayan border. Our study provides important findings
that demonstrate the relevance of building bi-national genomic surveillance workforces
in countries with porous and dynamic bordering regions.

METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 samples and ethical aspects.
A total of 122 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genomes were recovered from nasopharyngealthroat combined swabs samples collected from deceased cases (n = 5), clinically ill or
asymptomatic individuals that reside in five different Uruguayan departments (n = 54)
at the Brazilian border and 41 different municipalities of the RS Brazilian state (n = 68)
(Figure 1 and Table S1). Uruguayan samples were collected between May 5 and July
26, 2020, and underwent testing at the Universidad de la República, CENUR Litoral
Norte, Salto (Molecular Virology Lab), Sanatorio Americano Montevideo (SASA,
Molecular Biology Lab), Universidad de la República CURE Este, Rocha (Molecular
Ecology Lab), and Laboratory of DILAVE/MGAP-INIA-UdelaR (Tacuarembó).
Sequencing of the Uruguayan samples was held at the Institut Pasteur de Montevideo
(IPMON, Bioinformatics Unit) and Instituto de Investigaciones Biológicas Clemente
Estable (IIBCE, Genomics Department). Brazilian samples were recovered from
sentinel locations in RS state from March 9 to August 16, 2020, and sent to the central
laboratory from RS state (LACEN-RS) for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR detection. Positive
Brazilian samples were subsequently sent to the Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses and
Measles, IOC, FIOCRUZ, WHO Regional Reference Laboratory for Coronavirus in the
Americas. This study was approved by Ethics Committees in Uruguay (SASA Ethics
Committee; supplementary materials) and Brazil (FIOCRUZ-IOC Ethics Committee:
68118417.6.0000.5248, and Brazilian Ministry of Health SISGEN: A1767C3).
SARS-CoV-2 identification of positive samples, amplification and sequencing.
Molecular detection of the virus was performed with different kits at each center
(Biomanguinhos SARS-CoV-2 kit, OneStep RT-qPCR kit COVID-19 RT-PCR Real
TM Fast, Coronavirus COVID-19 genesig® Real-Time PCR assay), according to

manufacturer's instructions (supplementary materials). SARS-CoV-2 genomes were
recovered using both long and short PCR amplicon protocols12,13,14; and three
sequencing technologies: Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Illumina and Ion
Torrent (Table S1). See supplementary methods for details.
SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome consensus sequences.
Whole-genome consensus sequences obtained from ONT were generated using an
adaptation of the nCoV-2019 novel coronavirus Artic bioinformatics protocol
(https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) as in15 with
adjustments that are available at https://github.com/iferres/ncov2019-artic-nf. For
Illumina and Ion Torrent, bcftools was used for SNP calling (mpileup), SNP filtering
and consensus sequences reconstruction (consensus function) as described in detail in
supplementary material. Positions of interest were manually inspected to resolve
undetermined bases. All genomes obtained in this study were uploaded at the EpiCoV
database in the GISAID initiative under the accession numbers EPI_ISL_729794 to
EPI_ISL_729861 (Brazilian genomes) and accession numbers of Uruguayan genomes
are in Table S2.
SARS-CoV-2 genotyping and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses
Uruguayan and Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were initially assigned to
viral lineages according to16, using the Pangolin web application (https://pangolin.coguk.io) and later confirmed using maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses. ML
phylogenetic analyses were performed with the PhyML 3.0 program17, using an online
web server18 (supplementary materials). Branch support was assessed by the
approximate likelihood-ratio test based on a Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like procedure (SHaLRT) with 1,000 replicates19.
Phylogeographic analyses.

The previously generated ML trees were employed for the ancestral character state
reconstruction (ACR) of epidemic locations with PastML20, using the Marginal
Posterior Probabilities Approximation (MPPA) method with an F81-like model. We
next constructed a time-scaled Bayesian phylogenetic tree for the Brazilian and
Uruguayan sequences belonging to the B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 lineages using the
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST
1.1021 with BEAGLE library v3 to improve computational time (supplementary
materials). Viral migrations were reconstructed using a reversible discrete
phylogeographic model22 with a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) rate reference
prior23.
Within-host diversity.
Only those synapomorphic sites with at least 100 reads were kept for further analysis.
As samples were obtained by three different sequencing technologies with different
error profiles, a Shannon Entropy value (H) was estimated per observation based on the
four allele frequencies. We determined a linear model to estimate the contributions of
sequencing technology, sample and synapomorphic site, to the observed A, C, G, T
frequencies (summarized as H): H exp ¼ ~ SEQ + SAMPLE + MUTATION. We used
H exp ¼ to better fit a normal distribution (Figure S1C). Details in supplementary
materials.

RESULTS
Prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages at the Uruguayan-Brazilian border.
To understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread at the Brazilian-Uruguayan border,
we sequenced the viral genome from 54 individuals diagnosed between May 5 and July
27 in the five Uruguayan border departments (AR, CL, RI, RO and TT) and from 68

individuals diagnosed at 42 different municipalities from RS state collected between
March 9 and August 16, 2020 (Figure 1A and Table S1). These sequences were
combined with a few SARS-CoV-2 whole-genomes sequences from Uruguayan
individuals diagnosed at RI (n = 5) and Montevideo (n=1), and from Brazilian
individuals sampled in RS (n = 13) retrieved from the EpiCoV database in the GISAID
initiative. The resulting final dataset of 59 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Uruguayan
departments bordering Brazil represents 30% of all laboratory-confirmed cases (n =
201) in that region between March and July, 2020. A low fraction of Uruguayan (~4%)
and no Brazilian individuals here sequenced reported international travel or contact with
traveling people, indicating that most of them were locally infected. The SARS-CoV-2
genotyping of Uruguayan and Brazilian diagnosed at the border region revealed a quite
homogenous pattern as all sequences belonged to the B.1 lineage characterized by the
D614G mutation at the spike protein. Furthermore, all SARS-CoV-2 sequences from
Uruguayan departments at the border region belonged to the dominant Brazilian
lineages B.1.1.33 (85%) and B.1.1.28 (15%) (Figure 1B). Although different B.1 subclades were identified in RS, the Brazilian lineages B.1.1.33 (58%) and B.1.1.28 (21%)
were also the most prevalent across all state regions (Figure 1B).
Identification of major SARS-CoV-2 Uruguayan-Brazilian clades.
Phylogenetic trees of SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were inferred to
explore the Uruguayan and Brazilian-RS sequence clustering with sequences from other
Brazilian states and worldwide. The ML phylogenetic analyses revealed that most
SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Uruguay branched within four highly supported (aLRT =
1) Uruguayan clades (Figure 2). The largest B.1.1.33 Uruguayan clade TT-I33 (n = 28)
comprises all sequences detected in TT between June 18 and July 2. The B.1.1.33
clades RI-I33 (n = 19) and RI-II33 (n = 3) comprises all sequences detected in RI between

May 5 and June 5 and in late July, respectively (Figure 2A). The B.1.1.28 Uruguayan
clade AR-I28 (n = 4) comprises all sequences detected in AR (Bella Unión city) in late
July (Figure 2B). The B.1.1.33 sequence detected in March in Montevideo as well as
the B.1.1.28 sequences detected in July in AR (Artigas city), CL, RO and RI, appeared
as dyads or singletons.
The four major Uruguayan clades were nested among basal sequences from Brazil,
forming three highly supported (aLRT = 1) Brazilian-Uruguayan clades (Figure 2). The
largest clade (n = 39) designated as BR-UY-I33 comprises the Uruguayan clade TT-I33, a
group of basal Brazilian sequences (n = 10) isolated in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro
states between March 24 and June 6, and one sequence from Ireland. The second
Brazilian-Uruguayan clade designated as BR-UY-II33 comprises the Uruguayan clades
RI-I33 (n = 19) and RI-II33 (n = 3) and a group of Brazilian sequences (n = 8) isolated in
different municipalities from RS between May 6 and July 28 (Figure 2A). The third
Brazilian-Uruguayan clade designated as BR-UY-I28 comprises the Uruguayan clade
AR-I28 and one Brazilian sequence isolated in the São Paulo state on March 20 (Figure
2B). Our analysis also identified one highly supported (aLRT = 1) monophyletic group
designated as BR-RS-I33 (n = 12) that only comprises sequences from RS (Figure 2A).
Spatiotemporal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 Uruguayan-Brazilian clades.
To identify the number of independent introduction events of SARS-CoV-2 into
Uruguay and their most probable source location we used a ML-based probabilistic
method of ancestral character states reconstruction implemented in the PastML
program. Sequences were grouped according to country (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and
Uruguay) or region (North America, Europe and Oceania) of origin. The ML
phylogeographic analyses estimate nine separate viral introductions into Uruguay from
Brazil: five of the lineage B.1.1.28 and four of the lineage B.1.1.33 (Figure 3). Three

introductions of lineage B.1.1.33 and one introduction of lineage B.1.1.28 led to onward
transmission to more than one individual and gave origin to the Uruguayan clades RII33, RI-II33, TT-I33 and AR-I28.
To more accurately infer the geographic source and timing of virus introductions in
Uruguay, we conducted Bayesian-based phylogeographic and molecular clock analyses
of Brazilian and Uruguayan sequences. Viral migrations were inferred using a discrete
diffusion model between 13 locations: four Brazilian regions (Southeast, Northeast,
North and Central-West), three southern Brazilian states (RS, Parana and Santa
Catarina), and six Uruguayan locations (AR, CL, MO, TT, RI and RO). Bayesian
analyses recovered the same Uruguayan and Brazilian clades previously detected by the
ML analyses, with two exceptions: the clade RI-II33 branched outside the clade BR-UYII33 and no Brazilian sequences branched with high support with clade AR-II28.
Bayesian analyses pointed that the Southeast region was the most probable source
(posterior state probability [PSP] ≥ 0.96) of all B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses introduced
in Uruguay, with exception of clade RI-I33, a B.1.1.28 sequence from RI that most
probably originated in Brazil-RS (PSP ≥ 0.85) and the B.1.1.33 strain from Montevideo
that probably originated in the North Brazilian region (PSP = 1) (Figure 4 and Figures
S2 and S3).
The temporal origin of the lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 was traced back to February
2020 and the TMRCA of major Brazilian-Uruguayan clades were inferred at: March 12
(95% HPD: March 09-21) for clade BR-UY-I33, March 23 (95% HPD: March 14-31)
for clade BR-RS-I33, March 29 (95% HPD: March 12 - April 13) for clade BR-UY-II33,
May 2 (95% HPD: April 27 - May 04) for clade RI-I33, May 26 (95% HPD: May 12 June 07) for clade TT-I33, July 10 (95% HPD: June 27 - July 18) for clade RI-II33, and
July 2 (95% HPD: June 17 - July 16) for clade AR-I28. The detection lag (time interval

between cluster TMRCA and the first detected case) of major B.1.1.33 Uruguayan
outbreaks was estimated at 3 days (95% HPD: 1-8 days) for clade RI-I33 and 23 days
(95% HPD: 11-37 days) for clade TT-I33. The control lag (time interval between the
first detected case and the last transmission event) was estimated at 25 days (95% HPD:
20-28 days) for clade RI-I33 and 10 days (95% HPD: 6-12 days) for clade TT-I33.
SARS-CoV-2 lineage-defining SNPs and intra-patient viral diversity.
SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian-Uruguayan clades here identified displayed several lineagedefining SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms/mutations) that were sequentially
fixed during evolution and dissemination of each lineage (Figure 4 and Table S3). The
Uruguayan/Brazilian lineages (BR-UY-I33, BR-UY-II33 and BR-UY-I28) and the
Brazilian lineage BR-RS-I33 were all defined by one SNP. One SNP also characterized
all sequences from clade TT-I33 plus some basal Brazilian strains from São Paulo, two
SNPs defined clade TT-I33 and one additional SNP characterized all except one basal
sequence of clade TT-I33. Two SNPs characterized all sequences from clade RI-I33 plus
some basal Brazilian strains from RS, one SNP defined clade RI-I33 and three SNPs
defined clade RI-II33. The clade AR-I28 was defined by 10 SNPs (Table S3).
To better understand the dynamics of lineage-defining SNPs, we examine within-host
diversity patterns by analyzing the mapped reads at every SNPs position along the
genome in SARS-CoV-2 samples from the two major B.1.1.33 Brazilian-Uruguayan
clades (Table S4, S5). Our analysis of SNPs positions reveals that mutant alleles
displayed either low (<10%) or high (> 80%) frequency within each clade and we found
no evidence of sequences with intermediate frequencies (10-65%) (Figure 5A). The
most notable example was the mutation ORF1ab:15108C>T fixed during the
dissemination of clade TT-I33 that appeared at a very low frequency (<5%) in the basal
Uruguayan sample M70 (Figure 5B). Indeed, the estimated frequency of the mutant

allele in basal sequences from a given clade was not higher than the corresponding
frequency detected in sequences from a different clade (Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
Public health measures implemented by authorities were able to contain the early local
expansion of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay, but the intensive human mobility across the
contiguous dry borderland with Brazil can compromise long-term control of the
epidemic. Indeed, our analyses showed that the COVID-19 epidemic in the UruguayanBrazilian border is mostly dominated by the Brazilian lineages B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28
and that independent introductions of these lineages seeded the early outbreaks of
SARS-CoV-2 detected in Uruguayan departments at the bordering region.
Our phylogeographic analyses support that both SARS-CoV-2 lineages most probably
arose in the Southeast Brazilian region (PSP = 1) during February 2020, consistent with
previous findings8,15 and were later disseminated at multiple times into the Southern
region, making up 79% of all viral strains from the RS state. We distinguished two
B.1.1.33 local sub-clades that together comprise 45% of all B.1.1.33 strains from RS:
the clade BR-RS-I33 that arose by the end of March and seems to have remained
restricted to this Brazilian state, and the clade BR-UY-II33 that arose between late
March and early April and was later disseminated to Uruguay. These findings indicate
that the COVID-19 epidemic in the Southern Brazilian state of RS was mostly seeded
by epidemics from the Southeastern region.
The molecular epidemiologic profile of the COVID-19 epidemic at Uruguayan border
localities (dominated by lineages B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28) coincides with the observed
pattern in RS state and differs from the profile of early outbreaks in the capital city of
Montevideo (dominated by lineages A.5 and B.1)10,11. Our phylogeographic analyses

support that the Southeast Brazilian region and RS were the most probable sources of
seven and two viral introductions, respectively, into Uruguay. This finding, however,
should be interpreted with caution because potential sampling bias across Brazilian
regions might influence phylogeographic reconstructions and the actual number of viral
introductions from RS into Uruguay might be higher than here estimated24.
Our study supports that some of the viral strains introduced in the Uruguayan cities of
Rivera, Treinta y Tres and Bella Unión between early May and mid-July were able to
spread locally. The most successfully disseminated local lineages were RI-I33 and TT-I33
that drove the major early outbreaks detected in Rivera and Treinta y Tres in May and
June, respectively. Our analysis supports that SARS-CoV-2 Uruguayan clades displayed
a variable period of local cryptic transmission, lasted between one and three weeks.
Furthermore, the major Uruguayan clades took between 10 days and nearly a month to
be controlled. Long periods of cryptic circulation and/or long times to control, represent
a potential risk of viral dissemination from Uruguayan border localities into the
metropolitan region.
Our phylogenetic analyses identified several sub-clusters inside the B.1.1.28 and
B.1.1.33 lineages defined by a set of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations with
respect to the ancestral viruses that arose in Brazil in February, 2020. The number of
defining mutations ranges from one to 11 SNPs and correlates with the lineage TMRCA as
lineages with the youngest TMRCA displayed more SNPs than those with older ones. This
is consistent with a molecular clock model25 and with the notion that most SNPs are
probably evolutionary neutral26. Thus, while our study emphasizes the rapid genetic
differentiation of regional SARS-CoV-2 lineages in South America and the relevance of
molecular epidemiologic studies to track their emergence and spread, the observed

SNPs should not be interpreted as an adaptive signature of higher viral
transmissibility27.
Previous studies support that intra-host SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is transmissible
and information about within-host diversity could provide further resolution for
identification of geographic transmission clusters28 and to trace how low frequency
mutations become fixed in local clusters29. Our analyses of intra-host diversity,
however, revealed that mutations present at low-frequency (<10%) in basal strains of
major Uruguayan-Brazilian clusters become highly prevalent (>80%) during subsequent
transmissions, without evidence of basal samples with intermediate-frequency
alternative alleles. These findings support that minor intra-host SARS-CoV-2 variants
could become rapidly fixed due to stochastic events during inter-host transmissions and
later perpetuated along transmission chains30.
In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time a recurrent viral flux across the
Uruguayan-Brazilian border, with multiple introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian
lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 into Uruguayan localities at the border region, and the
potential of those viral introductions to ignite local outbreaks in Uruguay. These
findings provide clear evidence that public health measures for viral control were not
able to fully suppress the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 along the Uruguayan-Brazilian
border and this possess a major challenge for long-term epidemic control in Uruguay.
The present work also highlights the relevance of bi-national consortiums for genomic
surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to obtain in-depth insights and better control of viral
spread across highly permissive international borders.
