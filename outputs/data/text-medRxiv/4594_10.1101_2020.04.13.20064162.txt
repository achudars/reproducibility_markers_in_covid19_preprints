Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19:
A living systematic review protocol

ABSTRACT
Objective
To determine the impact of mesenchymal stromal cells outcomes important to patients with
COVID-19.
Design
This is the protocol of a living systematic review.
Data sources
We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature and in a centralised repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of
Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from Epistemonikos
database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of
evidence it covers and customised to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will
cover the period until the day before submission to a journal.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods
We adapted an already published common protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the
specificities of this question.
We will include randomised trials evaluating the effect of mesenchymal stromal cells versus
placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Randomised trials evaluating other coronavirus
infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomised studies in COVID-19 will be
searched in case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the direct evidence
provides low- or very low-certainty for critical outcomes.
Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk
of bias. We will pool the results using meta-analysis and will apply the GRADE system to assess the
certainty of the evidence for each outcome.
A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We will resubmit it every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates.
Ethics and dissemination
No ethics approval is considered necessary. The results of this review will be widely disseminated
via peer-reviewed publications, social networks and traditional media.
PROSPERO Registration
Submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID allocation).

Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19:
A living systematic review protocol

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is an infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [1]. It was first identified in
Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019 [2]; three months later, almost half a million cases of
contagion had been identified across 197 countries [3]. On March 11, 2020, WHO characterised the
COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic [1].
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some might progress to pneumonia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome and death [4],[5],[6]. The case fatality rate reported across
countries, settings and age groups is highly variable, but it ranges from about 0.5% to 10% [7]. In
hospitalised patients it has been reported to be higher than 10% in some centres [8].
Mesenchymal stromal cells, previously known as mesenchymal stem cells [9], exhibit the capacity
of homing to sites of injury and inflammation and exert antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory
effects [10]. These cells can affect the status of T cells and skew them towards a regulatory
phenotype, they also interact with B cells by inhibiting B cell responses [11]. Moreover, high
susceptibility of mesenchymal stromal cells to viral infections in vitro could impair the clinical
efficacy during an active viral infection [12].
Initial studies in COVID-19 patients suggest mesenchymal stromal cells would be able to reduce
inflammation [13]. Several findings support this hypothesis, such as the expression of
antiinflammatory and trophic factors, and the decrease of C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha and cytokine-secreting immune cells [14]. Additionally, the mesenchymal stromal
cells infused to patients with COVID-19 were not infected by SARS-CoV-2 [14]. In consequence, it
is expected that these cells could attenuate the overactivation of the immune system and support
repair by modulating the lung microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2 infection [15].
Nonetheless, the record for the research about mesenchymal stromal cells to treat a vast array of
diseases is not spectacular. Sound evidence of safety and efficacy is still lacking, despite
hundreds of studies with the claim that they constitute revolutionary treatments [16].
Using innovative and agile processes, taking advantage of technological tools, and resorting to the
collective effort of several research groups, this living systematic review aims to provide a timely,

rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence available on the role of mesenchymal
stromal cells in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19:
A living systematic review protocol

METHODS
This manuscript complies with the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses’ (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [17].
A protocol stating the shared objectives and methodology of multiple evidence syntheses
(systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews) to be conducted in parallel for different
questions relevant to COVID-19 was published elsewhere [18​]​. This protocol was adapted to the
specificities of the question assessed in this review and submitted to PROSPERO (awaiting ID
allocation).

Search strategies
Electronic searches
Our literature search was devised by the team maintaining
(​https://app.iloveevidence.com​) , using the following approach:

the

L·OVE

platform

1.

Identification of terms relevant to the population and intervention components of the
search strategy, using Word2vec technology [19] to the corpus of documents available in
Epistemonikos Database.
2. Discussion of terms with content and methods experts to identify relevant, irrelevant and
missing terms.
3. Creation of a sensitive boolean strategy encompassing all the relevant terms
4. Iterative analysis of articles missed by the boolean strategy, and refinement of the strategy
accordingly.
Our main search source will be Epistemonikos database ​(​https://www.epistemonikos.org​), a
comprehensive database of systematic reviews and other types of evidence [20]. We
supplemented it with articles from ​multiple sources relevant to COVID-19​ [21].
In sum, Epistemonikos Database acts as a central repository. Only articles fulfilling Epistemonikos
criteria are visible by users. The remaining articles are only accessible for members of COVID-19
L·OVE Working Group.
We will conduct additional searches using highly sensitive searches in PubMed/MEDLINE, the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase and the WHO International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

The searches will cover from the inception date of each database until the day before submission.
No study design, publication status or language restriction will be applied to the searches in
Epistemonikos or the additional searches.
The following strategy will be used to search in Epistemonikos Database. We will adapt it to the
syntax of other databases.

Other sources
In order to identify articles that might have been missed in the electronic searches, we will do the
following:
1.
2.
3.
4.

5.
6.

Screen the reference lists of other systematic reviews and evaluate in full text all the
articles they include.
Scan the reference lists of selected guidelines, narrative reviews and other documents.
Conduct cross-citation search in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic, using each
included study as the index reference.
Review websites from pharmaceutical companies producing drugs claimed as effective for
COVID-19, websites or databases of major regulatory agencies, and other websites
specialised in COVID-19.
Email the contact authors of all the included studies to ask for additional publications or
data on their studies, and for other studies in the topic.
Review the reference list of each included study.

Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19:
A living systematic review protocol

Eligibility criteria
Types of studies
We will preferentially include randomised trials. Howeve​r, information from non-randomised
studies will be used if there is no direct evidence from randomised trials or the certainty of
evidence for the critical outcomes resulting from the randomised trials is graded as low- or very
low, and the certainty provided by the non-randomised evidence grades higher than the one
provided by the randomised evidence [22].
We will exclude studies evaluating the effects on animal models or in vitro conditions.
Types of participants
We will include trials assessing participants with COVID-19, as defined by the authors of the trials.
Whenever we find substantial clinical heterogeneity on how the condition was defined, we will
explore it using a sensitivity analysis.
In case we find no direct evidence from randomised trials, or if the evidence from randomised
trials provides low- or very low-certainty evidence for critical outcomes, we will include
information from randomised trials evaluating mesenchymal stromal cells in other coronavirus
infections, such as MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections [22].

Type of interventions
The interventions of interest are mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from any tissue. We will not
restrict our criteria to any dosage, duration, timing or route of administration.
The comparison of interest will be placebo (mesenchymal stromal cells plus optimal treatment
versus placebo plus optimal treatment) or no treatment (mesenchymal stromal cells plus optimal
treatment versus optimal treatment).
Trials assessing mesenchymal stromal cells plus other interventions will be eligible if the
cointerventions are identical in both intervention and comparison groups.
Trials evaluating mesenchymal stromal cells in combination with other active interventions versus
placebo or no treatment will be also included.
Type of outcomes
We will not use the outcomes as an inclusion criteria during the selection process. Any article
meeting all the criteria except for the outcome criterion will be preliminarily included and assessed
in full text.

Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19:
A living systematic review protocol

We used the core outcome set COS-COVID [23], the existing guidelines and reviews and the
judgement of the authors of this review as an input for selecting the primary and secondary
outcomes, as well as to decide upon inclusion. The review team will revise this list of outcomes, in
order to incorporate ongoing efforts to define Core Outcomes Sets (e.g. COVID-19 Core Outcomes
[24].

Primary outcome
●

All-cause mortality

Secondary outcomes
●
●
●
●
●
●

Mechanical ventilation
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
Length of hospital stay
Respiratory failure
Serious adverse events
Time to ​SARS-CoV-2​ RT-PCR negativity

Other outcomes
●
●

Acute respiratory distress syndrome
Total adverse events

Primary and secondary outcomes will be presented in the GRADE ‘Summary of Findings’ tables, and
a table with all the outcomes will be presented as an appendix [25].

Selection of studies
The results of the literature search in Epistemonikos database will be automatically incorporated
into the ​L·OVE platform (automated retrieval), where they will be de-duplicated by an algorithm
comparing unique identifiers (database ID, DOI, trial registry ID), and citation details (i.e. author
names, journal, year of publication, volume, number, pages, article title and article abstract).
The additional searches will be uploaded to the screening software Collaboratron™ [26].

Mesenchymal stromal cells for COVID-19:
A living systematic review protocol

In both L·OVE platform and Collaboratron™, two researchers will independently screen the titles and
abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria. We will obtain the full reports for all titles
that appear to meet the inclusion criteria or require further analysis to decide about their inclusion.

We will record the reasons for excluding trials in any stage of the search and outline the study
selection process in a PRISMA flow diagram adapted for the purpose of this project .

Extraction and management of data
Using standardised forms, two reviewers will independently extract data from each included
study. We will collect the following information: study design, setting, participant characteristics
(including disease severity and age) and study eligibility criteria; details about the administered
intervention and comparison, including source of cells, dose, duration and timing (i.e. time after
diagnosis); the outcomes assessed and the time they were measured; the source of funding of the
study and the conflicts of interest disclosed by the investigators; the risk of bias assessment for
each individual study.
We will resolve disagreements by discussion, and one arbiter will adjudicate unresolved
disagreements.

Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias for each randomised trial will be assessed by using the 'risk of bias' tool (RoB 2.0: a
revised tool to assess risk of bias in randomised trials) [27]. We will consider the effect of
assignment to the intervention for this review. Two reviewers will independently assess five
domains of bias for each outcome result of all reported outcomes and time points. These five
domains are: bias due to (1) the randomisation process, (2) deviations from intended interventions
(effects of assignment to interventions at baseline), (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of
the outcome, and (5) selection of reported results. Answers to signalling questions and collectively
supporting information will lead to a domain‐level judgement in the form of 'Low risk of bias', 'Some
concerns', or 'High risk of bias'. These domain‐level judgements will inform an overall 'risk of bias'
judgement for each result. Discrepancies between review authors will be resolved by discussion to
reach consensus. If necessary, a third review author will be consulted to achieve a decision.
We will assess the risks of bias of other study designs with the ROBINS‐I tool (ROBINS-I: Risk Of
Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions) [28]. We will assess the following domains: bias

due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of
interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions (effect of assignment to
intervention), bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes and bias in the selection
of the reported result. We will judge each domain as low risk, moderate risk, serious risk, critical
risk, or no information, and evaluate individual bias items as described in ROBINS-I guidance. We
will not consider time‐varying confounding, as these confounders are not relevant in this setting
[28].
We will consider the following factors as baseline potential confounders:
●
●
●
●

Age
Comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, renal disease, eye disease, liver disease)
Co-interventions
Severity, as defined by the authors (i.e respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome
vs ICU requirement).

Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous outcomes, we will express the estimate of treatment effect of an intervention as
risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
For continuous outcomes, we will use mean difference and standard deviation (SD) to summarise
the data using a 95% CI. Whenever continuous outcomes are measured using different scales, the
treatment effect will be expressed as a standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI. When
possible, we will multiply the SMD by a standard deviation that is representative from the pooled
studies, for example, the SD from a well-known scale used by several of the studies included in the
analysis on which the result is based. In cases where the minimally important difference (MID) is
known, we will also present continuous outcomes as MID units or inform the results as the
difference in the proportion of patients achieving a minimal important effect between intervention
and control [29].
Then, these results will be displayed on the 'Summary of Findings Table' as mean difference [29].

Strategy for data synthesis
If we include more than one trial we will conduct meta-analysis for studies clinically homogeneous
using RevMan 5 [30], using the inverse variance method with random effects model. For any outcomes
where data were insufficient to calculate an effect estimate, a narrative synthesis will be presented.

A living systematic review protocol

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
We will perform subgroup analysis according to the definition of severe COVID-19 infection (i.e
respiratory failure vs respiratory distress syndrome vs ICU requirement). In case we identify
significant differences between subgroups (test for interaction <0.05) we will report the results of
individual subgroups separately.
We will perform sensitivity analysis excluding high risk of bias studies, and if non-randomised
studies are used, excluding studies that did not report adjusted estimates. In cases where the
primary analysis effect estimates and the sensitivity analysis effect estimates significantly differ,
we will either present the low risk of bias — adjusted sensitivity analysis estimates — or present the
primary analysis estimates but downgrading the certainty of the evidence because of risk of bias.

Assessment of certainty of evidence
The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes will be judged using the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology (GRADE
Working Group) [31], across the domains of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision and
reporting bias. Certainty will be adjudicated as high, moderate, low or very low. For the main
comparisons and outcomes, we will prepare Summary of Findings (SoF) tables [32],[29] and also
interactive Summary of Findings tables (​http://isof.epistemonikos.org/​). A SoF table with all the
comparisons and outcomes will be presented as an appendix.

Living evidence synthesis
An artificial intelligence algorithm deployed in the ​Coronavirus/COVID-19 topic of the L·OVE
platform will provide instant notification of articles with a high likelihood to be eligible. The authors
will review them, will decide upon inclusion, and will update the ​living web version of the review
accordingly. We will consider resubmission to a journal if there is a change in the direction of the
effect on the critical outcomes or a substantial modification to the certainty of the evidence.

This review is part of a larger project set up to produce multiple parallel systematic reviews
relevant to COVID-19 [​18​].
