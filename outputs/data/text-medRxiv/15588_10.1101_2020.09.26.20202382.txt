Abstract

12

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths

13

have been publicly reported in real-time to control the virus spread. However, substantial

14

undocumented infections have obscured the true prevalence of the virus. A machine learning

15

framework was developed to estimate time courses of actual new COVID-19 cases and current

16

infections in 50 countries and 50 U.S. states from reported test results and deaths, as well as

17

published epidemiological parameters. Severe under-reporting of cases was found to be

18

universal. Our framework projects for countries like Belgium, Brazil, and the U.S. ~10% of the

19

population has been once infected. In the U.S. states like Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida, more

20

than 4% of the population is estimated to be currently infected, as of September 3, 2020, while

21

in New York the fraction is 0.12%. The estimation of the actual fraction of currently infected

22

people is crucial for any definition of public health policies, which up to this point may have been

23

misguided by the reliance on confirmed cases.

Main Text
Since its initial spread in China in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019

27

(COVID-19) has caused more than 860,000 confirmed deaths all over the world as of

28

September 3, 2020 (1), and it continues to threaten the whole population most of which remain

29

susceptible to infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

30

As an effort to contain the virus, the daily counts of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths have

31

been publicly reported in real-time (2). However, substantial undocumented infections have

32

obscured the actual fraction of at least once infected people. A computational study estimated

33

the ratio of confirmed cases to actual cases, i.e., an ascertainment rate, to be only 14% during

34

the early outbreak in China (3). Large-scale seroprevalence studies aimed to estimate the

35

actual number of infections and found severe under-ascertainment in several U.S. states, where

36

the ascertainment rates varied from 4.2% in Missouri to 8.9% in New York and 16.7% in

37

Connecticut until March or April 2020 (4, 5). More importantly, we still do not know how many

38

individuals are currently infected in many countries and regions. The currently infected

39

population is the cause of future infections and deaths. Its actual size in a region is a crucial

40

variable required when determining the severity of COVID-19 and building strategies against

41

regional outbreaks.

42

This study presents machine learning-based estimates of actual sizes of currently

43

infected populations in select countries and all 50 U.S. states. These fractions of infected people

44

are derived by estimating daily ascertainment rates and subsequently adjusting the under-

45

reported COVID-19 cases. The estimates are based on publicly available datasets of daily

46

confirmed cases and deaths, and published estimates of key pandemic parameters. The

47

dataset for countries is from the repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering

48

(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (2), and the data for U.S. states are from the COVID

49

Tracking Project (6). Since the developed pipeline requires simple input, it is widely applicable

50

to more granular analyses of specific regions or communities, for which the number of

51

confirmed cases and deaths are being tracked. Using the proposed pipeline, an online

52

repository presents visualizations of daily updates on the estimated actual fraction of infected

53

people for the 50 countries with the most confirmed cases and for all 50 U.S. states (7).

54

The daily counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths alone possess incomplete

55

information on the relative abundance of epidemiological compartments of a population that is

56

susceptible, infected, recovered, or deceased. Whether to be confirmed or not adds another

57

layer of complexity to the categories of infected, recovered, or deceased compartments (Fig. 1).

58

In addition to the under-ascertainment, several limitations in the reported data make it

59

challenging to estimate the number of currently infected cases: recovery events are not tracked

60

in most countries; there are time delays between infection onset and laboratory-confirmation (3);

61

and even the death tolls are suggested to be under-reported in some regions (8, 9).

62

Key epidemiological parameters such as the Infection-Fatality-Rate (IFR) give us a clue

63

to fill the gap between confirmed and actual infections, under the assumption that the number of

64

undocumented deaths is negligible (Fig. 1). The IFR of COVID-19 has been a focus of intensive

65

research, yet studies from different locations and times have not reached a consensus estimate

66

(10). A recent large seroprevalence study in 133 cities of Brazil presented an IFR estimate of

67

1.0% (11). In a different approach, a study analyzed early pandemic data in China combined

68

with the prevalence obtained by PCR-testing of the entire international resident population

69

repatriated from China. The authors’ estimate of the IFR was 0.66% with a wide band of

70

uncertainty (0.39%–1.33%, 95%-confidence interval) (12). The same study also reported the

71

mean duration from onset of symptoms to death or recovery (17.8 and 24.7 days, respectively)

72

based on individual-level data. These estimates were employed here to infer the actual number

73

of infections across countries and regions. The IFR is known to heavily depend on age groups

74

(12) and would vary across countries with different age distributions. Therefore, applying the

75

above IFR estimate to a region with an extremely young or old population will be inappropriate.

76

But, considering the estimate’s large estimation uncertainty, the confidence interval is expected

77

to cover the true IFRs of most countries and U.S. states.

78

Our computational pipeline started with initial estimates of time courses of actual new

79

infections and new recoveries, derived from the daily confirmed deaths, the IFR estimate, and

80

the mean duration from infection to death and recovery (Fig. S1). The estimated new infections

81

led to two other initial estimates: a daily ascertainment rate that is the ratio of confirmed new

82

infections to the estimated new infections, and the number of currently infected cases each day.

83

Then a regression model was applied to find a functional relation of the daily infected cases to

84

the daily ascertainment rates, accounting for a common temporal trend of under-reporting

85

shown in both of the daily ascertainment rate and the ratio of confirmed cases to infected cases.

86

Employing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the pipeline iteratively updated the

87

time courses of ascertainment rates, new infections, and currently infected cases based on

88

each other until convergence to obtain final estimates. The same EM iterations were applied

89

with the lower/upper limits of the IFR estimate to obtain upper/lower 95%-confidence limits of

90

the estimated number of infections, respectively (Fig. S1, See Supplementary Methods for

91

details).

92

The estimates of the actual number of infections were validated using seroprevalence

93

data from the large-scale surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

94

(CDC) and New York state (4, 5, 13). The surveys collected serum samples in multiple U.S.

95

states and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the proportion of people who were

96

previously infected. Statewide seroprevalence estimates for six U.S. states were compared with

97

the computationally estimated cumulative incidence rates on the date one-week prior to the mid-

98

points of the serum collection periods, accounting for time delays from infection to antibody

99

detection.

100

Overall the described pipeline yielded accurate estimates of cumulative incidence when

101

compared to seroprevalence rates, with exception of Utah (Fig. 2). The estimated cumulative

102

incidence in New York by April 17, was 9.6% (5.2%–15.7%), which was in line with a

103

seroprevalence of 14.0% (NYS), although the estimate had a large uncertainty originating in the

104

wide confidence interval of the IFR estimate. The cumulative incidence rates in Washington

105

state were 0.6% (0.5%–0.7%) and 1.9% (1.2%–2.9%) by March 21 and April 27, respectively,

106

which were close to the seroprevalence of 1.1% and 2.1% surveyed in western Washington

107

state measured one week later. The estimated incidence rate of 3.7% (1.9%–6.3%) in

108

Connecticut by April 23, was in line with the seroprevalence of 4.9% in the first round, while the

109

incidence estimate of 12.3% (6.1%–20.8%) by May 17, differed from seroprevalence 5.2% in

110

the second round. As some studies reported that the antibodies decreased over time in some

111

patients (14, 15), the second round seroprevalence rates in the four states seemed to be

112

unstable. Indeed, the rates became even smaller than the first round in Utah and remained

113

almost the same in Connecticut and Missouri. In comparison to the seroprevalence rates in the

114

first round in Louisiana and Missouri, the cumulative incidence rates seemed to be slightly

115

underestimated. In Utah, the estimates and seroprevalence rates showed prominent

116

discrepancy, where the significantly low incidence estimate by April 20 suggested a possibility of

117

under-reported death tolls.

118

Applied across countries and U.S. states, the proposed framework estimated actual time

119

courses of new infections and currently infected cases. In early April, the U.S. reported ~30,000

120

daily confirmed cases. In striking contrast, the proposed estimation suggested a number of

121

actual daily cases of more than 400,000, showing that the daily ascertainment at that time was

122

less than 10% (Fig. 3A). As of September 3, 2020, 0.9% (0.5%–1.6%) of the U.S. population

123

was estimated to be currently infected. In Brazil, the under-reporting was also severe early in

124

the pandemic, but gradually improved as in the U.S. As a result, the peak in actual daily cases

125

seemed to have occurred between June 1 and June 8, 2020, reaching nearly 250,000 cases in

126

contrast to ~25,000 confirmed daily cases (Fig. 3B). This time of the peak in new infections was

127

earlier than the peak in confirmed cases, which fell between July 27 to August 3. The currently

128

infected cases in Brazil were estimated to be 2.3% (1.1%–3.9%) of the total population as of

129

September 3, 2020. Among U.S. states, Louisiana showed the highest estimated fraction of

130

currently infected people, 6.9% (3.7%–11.3%) as of September 3, 2020 (Fig. 3C). The first peak

131

in the daily new cases in Louisiana was allegedly ~1,500 around April 6, but the actual new

132

cases at that time were estimated to be more than 30,000, indicating the severity of under-

133

reporting in Louisiana during the month of April.

134

The severe under-ascertainment was universal across the 50 countries with the most

135

confirmed cases and 50 U.S. states. The ascertainment rates for the whole period until

136

September 3, 2020, widely varied from 5% in Italy to 99% in Qatar, and from 8% in Connecticut

137

to 71% in Alaska (Fig. 4A). Among them, 25 countries, 19 U.S. states, and Washington D.C.

138

showed an ascertainment rate less than 20% for the entire time of the pandemic. Focusing on

139

only the past two weeks the ascertainment rates unfortunately have not improved much in these

140

countries, while the recent rates of U.S. states increased overall as of September 3, 2020.

141

Interestingly, many of the countries with high ascertainment rates from the beginning of the

142

outbreak were the ones that previously experienced Middle East respiratory syndrome

143

coronavirus.

144

The under-reporting adjustment allowed us to monitor the actual severity of the virus

145

spread across countries and U.S. states, and especially the estimated sizes of currently infected

146

populations helped to identify fast-changing COVID-19 hotspots. In Peru, Belgium, and Brazil,

147

more than 10% of the population were estimated to be once infected as of September 3, 2020

148

(Fig. 4B). Across U.S. states, the cumulative incidence rates ranged from 28.2% (14.0%–

149

47.7%) in New Jersey to 0.9% (0.6%–1.5%) in Hawaii (Fig. 4B). As of September 3, 2020,

150

COVID-19 hotspots among U.S. states were estimated to be Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida,

151

where currently infected cases were estimated to be more than 4%.

152

The estimated fractions of current infections differentiated New Jersey from New York,

153

both of which experienced severe early outbreaks (Fig. 4B). The confirmed new cases per

154

100,000 population were 3.8 in New Jersey and 3.7 in New York as of September 3, 2020,

155

suggesting that the virus spread was under control in both states. However, because of the

156

differences in recent ascertainment rates between the two states (Fig. 4A) the fractions of

157

currently infected people were 1.05% (0.52%–1.78%) in New Jersey and 0.12% (0.06%–0.20%)

158

in New York, as of September 3, 2020. This reveals New Jersey as still with a considerable

159

infected population whereas New York has become one of the safest states.

160

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Case-Fatality-Rates (CFRs) have

161

displayed huge differences between countries, adding confusion to how deadly SARS-CoV-2 is.

162

The crude CFRs, which are the ratios of total confirmed deaths to total confirmed cases, ranged

163

from 13.0% in Italy to 0.05% in Singapore as of September 3, 2020. Our analysis now reveals

164

that the variation on CFR reports across the countries and U.S. states is primarily associated

165

with the massive differences in ascertainment rates between the locations (Fig. 4C). The

166

Spearman rank correlations between CFR and ascertainment rate were -98% and -97% (P-

167

values < 0.0001) for the analyzed countries and the U.S. states, respectively. After adjustment

168

for the under-reporting, the inferred IFRs, which were based on the assumed IFR 0.66%, did not

169

correlate with the ascertainment rates (Fig. S2). Thus, a high CFR in a region is shown to be a

170

result of severe under-reporting of the cases.

171

This study demonstrates that severe under-ascertainment has obscured the true severity

172

of widespread COVID-19 all over the world. In the majority of the 50 countries, actual

173

cumulative cases were estimated to be 5–20 times greater than the confirmed cases. Given that

174

the confirmed cases only capture the tip of the iceberg in the middle of the pandemic, the

175

estimated sizes of current infections in this study provide crucial information to determine the

176

regional severity of COVID-19 that can be misguided by the confirmed cases.

177

It is a challenging task to estimate actual numbers of COVID-19 infections based on

178

under-reported limited data, especially to make a framework applicable for many regions that

179

have displayed diverse dynamic patterns in the infections and ascertainment rates. As the

180

pandemic progresses, the pipeline would need to be adapted to the increasing complexity of the

181

infection data. The proposed estimation heavily relies on the published estimate of the IFR that

182

has large estimation uncertainty. The estimates of actual cases would become more accurate if

183

the IFR estimate is optimized to a specific region and its uncertainty can be reduced. The

184

pipeline only takes the simple input of the confirmed cases and deaths. Depending on available

185

datasets in each region, the estimation of actual cases can be improved by augmenting more

186

information such as daily positivity rates of diagnostic testing or daily hospitalized cases.

Figure 1. Undocumented COVID-19 cases.

260

In an epidemic process, a population is categorized into susceptible, infected, deceased, or

261

recovered individuals. Counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries are

262

insufficient to calculate the number of currently infected individuals (purple dotted box) because

263

of substantial undocumented infections not captured by diagnostic tests. The input to the

264

proposed framework is the daily counts of confirmed new cases and deaths (black boxes).

265

Using pandemic parameters such as the Infection-Fatality-Rate and the mean duration periods

266

from infection to death and recovery, the framework estimates the counts of actual new cases

267

(red dotted box) and currently infected individuals.

Seroprevalence rates (black) are overlaid on computationally estimated time courses of

274

cumulative incidence rates (red) from March 13 to September 3, 2020, for New York,

275

Washington state, Connecticut, Louisiana, Missouri, and Utah from upper-left to lower-right. The

276

indicated date of the seroprevalence rate is the mid-point of the serum collection period. The

277

corresponding cumulative incidence estimate is on the date one-week prior to the date of the

278

seroprevalence rate to account for time delays from infection to antibody detection. Error bars

279

and shaded bands indicate 95% confidence intervals.

The proposed framework provides estimates of time courses of actual new cases and
current infections based on daily reported counts of confirmed positive tests and deaths in a
particular region and published estimates of key pandemic parameters such as the infectionfatality-rate (IFR) and the mean duration from infection to death and recovery. For the purpose
of this study data of daily confirmed cases and deaths for countries and U.S. states were taken
from the repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns
Hopkins University (1), and the COVID Tracking Project (2), respectively. Upon availability of
other more granular data sets, the proposed framework can also be applied to smaller
populations. The data of the country population as of July 2019 was from the United Nations (3),
and the population data for U.S. states as July 2019 was from the U.S. Census Bureau (4).

To begin with, the counts of daily confirmed cases and deaths were averaged in a 7-day
rolling window to remove weekend effects, which tend to yield systematic drops in the Saturday
and Sunday values. To obtain initial guesses on actual counts of daily new cases and
recoveries, we first combined the daily death counts and the IFR estimate (𝐼𝐹𝑅0 = 0.66%) that
was presented by Verity et al. (5) as follows: Let 𝐴𝐶𝑡 , 𝐶𝐶𝑡 , 𝐼𝑡 , 𝐷𝑡 , 𝑅𝑡 denote the number of actual
new cases, confirmed new cases, currently infected cases, new deaths, and new recoveries on
day t, respectively. Using the mean duration estimates (5), we assumed that one new death on
1
day t implied 1/𝐼𝐹𝑅0 new actual cases on day (𝑡 − 𝑑1 ), 𝑑1 = 18, and (
− 1) new recoveries

where 𝐼𝑡 is the derived initial estimate of the currently infected cases on day t. These initial
time courses led to two other initial estimates for daily ascertainment rates (𝐴𝑡 ), and daily ratios
of the confirmed new cases to currently infected cases, referred to as detected transmission
rates (𝐷𝑇𝑡 ):

356

Both ratio estimates displayed a common increasing trend in many countries, probably
indicating that the under-ascertainment was gradually improving as the testing capacities were
increasing. The common trend could be exploited to obtain better estimates of the daily
ascertainment rates.

An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was implemented to update the latent time
courses involved in actual infections. To first extract the temporal trends of the estimated daily
ascertainment rates and detected transmission rates, the two rate time courses were splinesmoothed. Since the noise-levels around the temporal trends were different depending on
regional population sizes, infection dynamics, and test reporting schemes, we applied multiple
levels of smoothness and selected the optimal level after the complete EM computation as
discussed below. For smoothing, we applied the R (6) function smooth.spline(). Since the

(Eq. 1)

where the regression coefficients were estimated with constraints of 𝛽1 , 𝛽2 ≥ 0 using an R

initial ascertainment rates:

The above EM steps enabled iterative updates of the latent time courses on actual infections.
For each smoothness parameter ℎ, the following EM algorithm was applied to obtain converged
estimates (Fig. S1A).

3. Optimization toward the smallest variation of daily death rates

380
381
382

After completing EM iterations with multiple smoothness parameters (ℎ), the converged
time courses of currently infected cases were assessed by using corresponding daily rates of
deaths among the infected cases:

383

𝐷𝑡
.
𝑡−1 (ℎ)

𝐷𝑅𝑡 (ℎ) = 𝐼�

384
385
386
387

The framework selected the smoothness parameter value (ℎ�) and the final estimate of current
infections (𝐼𝑡� �ℎ��) that produced the smallest coefficient of variation (CV) of 𝐷𝑅𝑡 (ℎ) over time.
Underlying this choice is the assumption that increasing variation in daily death rates would be
less plausible.

388
389

To obtain 95%-confidence intervals (CIs) of the current infection estimates, the same
initialization and EM iterations were applied using the lower/upper limits of the IFR estimate and
