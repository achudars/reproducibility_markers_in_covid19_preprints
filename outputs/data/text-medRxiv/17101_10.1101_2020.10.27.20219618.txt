Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted planned annual antibiotic mass drug
administration (MDA) activities which have formed the cornerstone of the largely successful
global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem.
Methods: Using a mathematical model we investigate the impact of interruption to MDA in
trachoma-endemic settings. We evaluate potential measures to mitigate this impact and
consider alternative strategies for accelerating progress in those areas where the trachoma
elimination targets may not be achievable otherwise.
Results: We demonstrate that for districts which were hyperendemic at baseline, or where
the trachoma elimination thresholds have not already been achieved after 3 rounds of MDA,
the interruption to planned MDA could lead to a delay greater than the duration of
interruption. We also show that an additional round of MDA in the year following MDA
resumption could effectively mitigate this delay. For districts where probability of elimination
under annual MDA was already very low, we demonstrate that more intensive MDA schedules
are needed to achieve agreed targets.
Conclusion: Through appropriate use of additional MDA, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of
delay to reaching trachoma elimination targets can be effectively mitigated. Additionally,
more frequent MDA may accelerate progress towards 2030 goals.

Introduction
In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on 1 April 2020 the World Health Organization
(WHO) released interim guidance that community-based surveys, active case-finding and
mass drug administration (MDA) programmes for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs),
including trachoma, be postponed.1
Annual district-level MDA of oral azithromycin, which targets the whole community, has
formed the mainstay of global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem, with
a single dose demonstrated to have good efficacy against ocular strains of Chlamydia
trachomatis, the causative agent of trachoma.2 This strategy has proved to be widely
successful in community-randomized studies and confirmed by the growing number of
previously endemic countries which are now reaching the active trachoma threshold for
elimination as a public health problem (EPHP), which is a prevalence of trachomatous
inflammation—follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years of less than 5% (TF1-9<5%).3–6

Given the pivotal role of annual MDA in the progress made in recent years, there are growing
concerns regarding the potential impact of interruption to programmatic activities due to
COVID-19. Upon cessation of MDA, empirical studies have indicated that in some areas
infection returns exponentially, with a rate of resurgence anticipated to be faster in highertransmission settings.7,8 In the context of programmatic activities being temporarily halted
due to COVID-19, this is especially concerning for previously high-prevalence districts midway through trachoma elimination programmes. Furthermore, there are a finite number of
districts where models suggest that under a strategy of annual MDA, elimination is not
achievable,9,10 with the reproductive number under annual treatment (RT) being greater than
1 (defined as “MDA super-critical” by Blumberg and colleagues).9 For these districts there is
concern that the interruption to programmes may cause a particularly marked surge in
transmission with unknown consequences for morbidity. Regardless of the impact of COVID19, these districts may need to implement alternative control strategies if EPHP is to be
achieved.9

Building on previously developed mathematical models for trachoma transmission, we
explore the impact of an interruption to community-level MDA in a range of endemic settings.

Our individual-based stochastic model incorporates some key aspects of ocular C. trachomatis
infection biology, including acquired immunity leading to decreased duration of infection with
repeated infection and allows simulation of some of the variability in response to MDA
observed in empirical studies.2,7,11,12 We also consider the effect of additional rounds of MDA
in the year following the resumption of activities as a potential mitigation strategy. For those
settings where reaching the EPHP target may not be achievable under current practice, we
then explore the potential effectiveness of enhanced MDA protocols beyond 2020, as
possible strategies for both mitigation and acceleration towards EPHP targets.
Methods
Model structure.
The model for C. trachomatis transmission is based on a previously described framework,13
which accounts for TF persisting after clearance of ocular C. trachomatis infection. Individuals
transitioning through four sequential states: Susceptible (S), infected but not yet diseased (I),
infected and diseased (ID) or diseased but no longer infected (D), illustrated in Figure 1. Here
disease refers to active trachoma, specifically TF. Within this framework, people who have
cleared infection but remain diseased (D) are susceptible to infection but with force of
infection (𝜆) reduced by a factor (𝛤). Further model description and model parameter
definitions, values and sources are given in supplementary data (see Table S1).

The original ODE population-based model has previously been adapted to be stochastic, and
has been further developed here to a fully stochastic individual-based model.14 Age, current
infection/disease status and total number of infections for each individual are explicitly
incorporated; the model runs in one-week timesteps.

Following the specifications of the original model and evidence from empirical studies, 2,12,13
duration of ID and D disease for each individual are assumed to decrease with each
subsequent infection following a negative exponential; calculated durations for each infection
are used as fixed transition periods in contrast to the exponential transitions utilised in
previous models.13,14

Treatment and systematic non-adherence.
Community-wide MDA is assumed to be delivered to all ages with an 80% coverage level, in
line with WHO minimum target coverage,15 and an efficacy (the probability that an individual
who receives MDA clears infection) of 85% is assumed.16 To simulate the potentially lower
efficacy of topical tetracycline eye ointment (which is routinely given to children aged less
than 6 months), treatment is assumed to be 50% less effective in this age group.

In order to account for the possible role of systematic non-adherence to MDA, the “controlled
correlation” method proposed by Dyson and colleagues is incorporated into the model
(described in Supplementary Data).17 Briefly, is the correlation parameter; if =0, this is the
equivalent to all rounds being randomly distributed (no systematic non-adherence) and if =1
this corresponds to only those individuals who received the first round of treatment receiving
future rounds (i.e. the same people are missed at every round; complete systematic nonadherence).
Settings and Simulated Scenarios.
Impact of 12 month interruption.
Trachoma-endemic settings are generally categorised as hypo-, meso- and hyperendemic,
corresponding to TF prevalence in ages 1-9 (TF1-9) of 5-9.9%, 10-29.9% and ≥30%. We
modelled the different settings by varying the transmission parameter, with simulations fitted
to prevalence category at most recent survey. Here we considered three alternatives: the
most recent prevalence estimate could be either at baseline (i.e. before MDA has taken
place), or at an impact survey after three or five rounds of annual MDA.
The average impact of a 12-month programme interruption (i.e. MDA is delivered 12 months
later than intended, equivalent to a 2 year gap between MDA rounds) is then estimated in
terms of average delay to reaching the threshold of TF1-9 <5%. The median delay is estimated
as the difference between the median time to reaching the EPHP threshold after a 12 month
interruption, and the median time to reaching the EPHP threshold if the interruption had not
occurred (see Supplementary Data Table S2).

Interruption is simulated to take place in the first year after the most recent survey for
hypoendemic settings (i.e. year 1 for hypoendemic at baseline, year 4 for hypoendemic after
3 rounds of MDA and year 6 for hypoendemic after 5 years MDA), in the second year after
most recent survey for mesoendemic settings, and in the third year for hyperendemic
settings.

Impact of mitigation strategies.
To evaluate in more detail the potential for mitigating the impact of COVID-19, we simulate
both interruption and mitigation strategies in settings that would have been expected to
reach the TF1-9 <5% threshold before 2030 with a strategy of annual district-level MDA
targeting the whole community, but where an interruption is expected to cause a delay in
achieving this control threshold (corresponding to an R0>1 and an RT<1; defined as MDA
subcritical by Blumberg and colleagues9). Two settings with differing levels of transmission
are considered: Setting 1 corresponding to a mean baseline (before MDA) TF1-9 of 40% (range
37.5-42.5), and Setting 2 corresponding to a mean baseline TF1-9 of 20% (range 17.5-22.5). A
12-month delay in MDA (yielding a 2-year gap in treatment) is simulated mid-way through a
planned programme, assuming a 5-year MDA programme for Setting 1 (interruption in year
3) and a 3-year MDA programme for Setting 2 (interruption in year 2). Two mitigation
strategies that could be implemented after resuming activities were then considered:
Mitigation protocol 1 (M1), an additional round of community-wide MDA (all ages) delivered
6 months after the programme restarts;
Mitigation protocol (M2), an additional round of MDA targeting only children aged 1-9 years
delivered 6 months after the programme restarts.

Mitigation and acceleration
A third setting, denoted Setting 3, is simulated to represent those districts which after more
than 10 years of annual MDA, are still endemic (corresponding roughly to RT>1, defined as
supercritical by Blumberg).9 This is done by simulating a higher level of transmission and also
by filtering the stochastic simulations to include only those where TF1-9 is ≥10% after 10 annual
rounds of MDA (further details Supplementary Data). MDA interruption is simulated to take
place in year 11. As this setting is intended to be representative of those settings in which

previous models indicate a new paradigm may be needed to achieve EPHP, two alternative
strategies are simulated. These are:

Mitigation and acceleration protocol 1 (MA1), which consists of two extra rounds of MDA
targeting children aged 2-9 years only, delivered one week and 3 weeks after the normal
annual community-wide MDA; and
Mitigation and acceleration protocol 2 (MA2), which consists of 3 extra rounds of MDA
targeting children aged 2-9 years at 3 month intervals following an annual community-wide
MDA.

These are two strategies that have confirmed approval in Ethiopia (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier NCT03523156 for MA1; NCT03335072 for MA2).18

A population of size 1000 was considered for all simulations which were run for 16 simulated
years, except for Setting 3 where 23 years were simulated. Initial sets of stochastic simulations
were filtered to give at least 1000 simulations for analysis based on criteria described
(baseline prevalence or prevalence after a given number of MDA rounds). For Settings 1 and
2 (including mitigation simulations) to ensure simulations were representative of settings
where TF1-9<5% would have been achievable by 2030, simulations which did not reach TF 1-9
<5% were also removed and not considered for analysis. The impact of systematic nonadherence is also explored for Setting 3 by setting the adherence correlation parameter

to

0, 0.3 or 0.5. Confidence intervals are estimated as 95th centiles. All simulations were
implemented in R version 3.6.3.

Results.
Figure 3 summarises the delay to programmes following a 1 year interruption across a range
of endemic settings and levels of transmission, described by TF 1-9 (x-axis) at the most recent
survey, which may have been at baseline, after 3 years of MDA or after 5 years of MDA (yaxis; further results Supplementary Data Table S2). As expected, higher baseline prevalence
levels (which correspond to higher transmission settings) are more impacted by a one year
interruption to MDA in terms of delay to reaching the EPHP threshold. In settings where the
baseline prevalence was more than 40%, or where TF1-9 has not been achieved after 3 or 5

years of annual MDA, the delay to achieving the EPHP threshold is estimated to be
substantially longer than the interruption. Furthermore, where TF 1-9 is greater than 15% after
3 years of MDA or greater than 10% after 5 years of MDA, the median time to achieving the
threshold is longer than the length of the simulation (16 years).

Figure 4 (panels B and D) shows that with an additional round of community-wide MDA in the
year following interruption (mitigation scenarios M1), the prevalence of infection for both
Setting 1 and Setting 2 is effectively reduced to where it would have been had the interruption
not occurred. This has the effect of reducing the delay to achieving the EPHP threshold so that
it is close to the duration of the interruption (12 months) for both settings (Figure 4 Panels A
and B; Table 1), but due to the slower bounce-back rate the additional benefit of the
mitigation round is not so pronounced in Setting 2.
The impact of a mitigation round targeting children only (mitigation scenario M2; Table 2) in
terms of delay and probability of reaching the threshold after a given number of
MDA rounds is very similar to scenario M1 in which residents of all ages are offered
antibiotics in the mitigation round.

The simulations for Setting 3 (Figure 5 and Table 2) indicate that even without the interruption
due to COVID-19 (scenario I), transmission levels in this setting are such that in the context of
annual MDA, the probability of reaching the EPHP threshold for active trachoma is very low,
even after 20 years of MDA and if no systematic non-adherence is assumed. In this Setting,
only 4.9% of simulations reach TF1-9<5% by 2030 when treatment is assumed to be random
(adherence-correlation parameter =0), and only 0.9% if

=0.5. Both the mitigation and

acceleration strategies simulated (MA1 and MA2) show clear improvement in the probability
of reaching the EPHP goal by 2030. Where no systematic non-adherence is assumed ( =0),
the median year in which TF1-9<5% would be reached is estimated to be 2027 for MA1
(representing 21 rounds of MDA post-2020) and 2024 for MA2 (after 14 rounds of MDA).
These estimates are based on the assumption that these protocols are implemented in 2021
with the same minimum coverage level as before interruption, and continued until the
TF1-9<5% threshold is achieved. For the mitigation and acceleration strategies MA1 and
MA2, if systematic non-adherence is assumed to increase, the probability of reaching the

threshold decreases, but remains markedly higher than that for continued annual MDA
(Table 2).
Discussion
Our results provide quantitative insights into the impact the current disruption to MDA
activities may have on global efforts to eliminate trachoma, highlighting the need to prioritise
mitigation strategies in those areas where the impact is predicted to be greatest. We also
demonstrate the imperative need for alternative approaches in those areas where EPHP is
unlikely to be achieved under existing protocols, notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19.

For those settings where EPHP would on average be achievable before 2030 (corresponding
to RT<1 described by Blumberg and colleagues),9 but which were either hyperendemic at
baseline (Setting 1) or where control has not been achieved after 3 years of MDA, our results
indicate that missing a single round of treatment will lead to an increase in the number of
MDA rounds needed to reach elimination targets. Following a 1-year interruption in these
settings, it is estimated it will take on average more than 2 years to catch up if no mitigation
protocols are implemented. By comparison, in Setting 2, where transmission is lower and
baseline prevalence is mesoendemic (mean 20%), EPHP targets would still on average be
reached after the same number of treatment rounds, and the length of the delay will be closer
to the 1 year length of the simulated interruption. It is clear that as the level of transmission
increases, the rate of resurgence during a period of programmatic interruption will also
increase, which corresponds to the greater delay and number of treatment rounds necessary
to make up lost ground once treatment is restarted. This is consistent with the expectation,
supported by empirical evidence, that trachoma resurges more rapidly in higher prevalence
settings.7,8
We also demonstrate that for both Setting 1 and Setting 2, a single additional round of MDA
in the year following disruption will be sufficient to bring infection levels back to the level
they would have been if the interruption had not occurred. The impact of this additional
round is shown to be similar regardless of whether only children or the whole community are
targeted. This is representative of the fact that in the model framework, in accordance with
empirical evidence, children effectively act as a core group, due to both the higher bacterial
loads and longer duration of infection that is assumed for early infections.2,19–22

It is noteworthy that for both Settings 1 and 2, even though mitigation MDA rounds bring
infection levels back to where they would have been without interruption, this still leads to
delay in achieving the EPHP threshold of approximately the same length as the interruption
time period (just over one year). This is because the model represents the persistence of TF
following resolution of infection. TF is a lagging indicator of infection at both the individual
and population level, with correlation between TF and infection prevalence generally
decreasing following MDA.23

With risk of donor fatigue a growing concern for many NTD control programmes,24 avoiding
a prolonged delay to reaching EPHP targets is clearly a priority. Moreover, a delay to reaching
trachoma thresholds will have a negative effect in terms of morbidity. Any surge in
transmission during interruption, and every year of delay to achieving EPHP, corresponds to
more C. trachomatis infections at both the individual and community level, the cumulative
impact of which is more severe pathology and sequelae.25 In the mitigation scenarios
explored here, additional catch-up rounds were simulated at 6 months after the programme
restarted, and it is acknowledged that the timing of any additional rounds is likely to be
primarily dictated by operational and financial constraints. Previous work suggests that
regardless of timing, the anticipated mitigating effect of additional rounds of MDA delivered
in the year following interruption would be equivalent.26 Therefore, to minimise impact both
on morbidity and delay to achieving EPHP, additional rounds of MDA should be prioritised in
high transmission settings, and delivered as soon as is practicable once programmes are able
to restart at the same coverage levels as previously implemented.

Whilst a single additional round of MDA may be sufficient in some settings to bring infection
levels back to where they would have been without interruption, for those settings where
current schedules would not achieve EPHP even if interruption had not occurred, this is
clearly far from adequate.
The mitigation and acceleration strategies simulated here represent two potential new
paradigms of treatment for these settings, with both predicting clear improvement when
compared to annual MDA. Both strategies have confirmed approval in Ethiopia, which may
be similar to Setting 3. Whilst model predictions for MA2 indicate an increased probability of
achieving EPHP compared to MA1, and trials have already demonstrated the efficacy of a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.20219618; this version posted October 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this

similar protocol,5 logistical and financial constraints mean quarterly treatment (MA2) may be
less feasible than three closely spaced treatment rounds (MA1). Furthermore, uncertainty
regarding the assumptions of the model limits direct comparisons between the two
protocols.

For both mitigation and acceleration strategies, if even a relatively low level of systematic
non-compliance is assumed ( =0.3), the probability of achieving EPHP is decreased, although
it would still be considerably greater than with annual MDA (at least a 10-fold increase in
probability of achieving EPHP for either MA1 or MA2). However, the model assumes that
individuals who are unlikely to adhere to treatment recommendations are randomly
distributed throughout the population,17 whereas in reality, it is not only how many people
are repeatedly missed by MDA, but who is missed, that determines the overall success of a
programme. A study of trachoma endemic communities in Niger, for example, indicated that
people who do not present for treatment are in fact less likely to be infected with ocular C.
trachomatis.27 A study in Ethiopia indicated that levels of refusal were extremely low, at 0.6%
of those offered azithromycin,28 with travelling during the campaign given as a major reason
for non-treatment. Whether a protocol of repeated treatment rounds within a short space of
time (MA1) or evenly spaced throughout the year (MA2) will maximise the probability of
reaching all individuals targeted will likely be context-specific, but if systematically missed
people are in fact less likely to be infected, the impact of non-adherence will be overestimated
by the model. Another potentially important assumption of the model is that at the individual
level, the infection-clearance outcome of receiving antibiotics is essentially binary and applied
instantaneously. In reality however, even if an individual does not clear infection after
treatment, their bacterial load is likely to be reduced. The implication of this is that the model
predictions for MA1, in which three MDA rounds are delivered very close to each other, are
likely to be somewhat pessimistic. Further empirical data on heterogeneity of bacterial load
and efficacy of treatment for a given bacterial load would improve the biological realism of
this aspect of the model.

Within the model framework used here, the higher transmission rates and baseline
prevalence levels are simulated by increasing the transmission parameter. This parameter
does not have a directly interpretable meaning in itself but can be considered a proxy for the

range of factors that facilitate transmission of ocular C. trachomatis infection. These include
overcrowding, lack of access to clean water, and comorbidities. Due to uncertainty regarding
their impact, the model does not currently incorporate the potential reduction in
transmission afforded by facial cleanliness and environmental improvement interventions,
which also form part of the WHO strategy for trachoma control in addition to MDA.15 As such,
the model predictions could be considered conservative. However, there are many potential
indirect effects for COVID-19 on ocular C. trachomatis transmission in addition to the
interruption to MDA which are as yet unknown. Given directives on physical distancing and
the increased promotion of hygiene practices such as handwashing, it may be that
transmission of C. trachomatis will decrease following COVID-19 in some settings. However,
other possible consequences of COVID-19 such as migration, changes to health-seeking
behaviour and economic hardship may exacerbate the increases in infection predicted by the
model.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge to communities and
healthcare systems worldwide. Whilst the current interruption to NTD control activities is
clearly in line with the urgent need to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial that
trachoma programmes are resumed at the same coverage levels as before interruption, as
soon as is practicable. Further work is needed to confirm which districts should be prioritised
for additional mitigation rounds of MDA once programmes are able to resume, and also to
identify those districts where mitigation and acceleration are needed, with the current
interruption potentially creating an opportunity to critically appraise and revise protocols as
we look towards 2030.

adherence correlation parameter 𝜌 is varied here in order to account for the possible role of systematic nonadherence to MDA. If 𝜌 =0, this is the equivalent to all rounds being randomly distributed (no systematic non-adherence);
𝜌 =0.3 can be interpreted as a low level of systematic non-adherence, and 𝜌 =0.5 can be interpreted as an intermediate
level of systematic non-adherence. If 𝜌 =1 this would correspond to the same individuals being missed at each round of

Supplementary Data.
Further details on transmission model.
The model is based on a previously described framework1 which was validated and
identified as the most parsimonious and best fit to cross-sectional PCR and TF data in a
study comparing several possible frameworks for C. trachomatis transmission.2
The individual-based stochastic model described here incorporates some key aspects of
ocular C. trachomatis infection biology, including acquired immunity leading to decreased
duration of infection with repeated infection3,4 and allows simulation of some of the
variability in response to MDA observed in empirical studies.5,6 Based on a modified SEIR
framework (S=Susceptible; E=Exposed; I=Infectious; R=Recovered), individuals transition
through four sequential states: Susceptible (S), infected but not yet diseased (I), infected
and diseased (ID) or diseased but no longer infected (D). (See Figure 1 main text).
For each individual i, the duration of first ID and D periods (IDi,1; Di,1) are randomly assigned
from Poisson distributions, with distribution means given as the baseline (longest) duration
used by Pinsent and colleagues (see Table S1).1 The duration of these periods for subsequent
infections are then assumed to decrease following a negative exponential to a minimum
value, with decay rates and minimum durations also as given by Pinsent and colleagues.1
Similarly, it is assumed that an individual’s infectivity is proportional to their bacterial load,
and that this also declines from the first infection following a negative exponential with each
subsequent infection. For each individual’s (i) infection number (j), the calculated durations
of IDi,j and Di,j are used as fixed transition periods, in contrast to exponential transitions
utilised in the previous models.1,7 In order to ensure that the age-distribution of historical
infections (and therefore infectivity, duration of infection and disease) are representative for
a given level of transmission, a 40 year burn-in period was implemented for all simulations
(burn-in period not considered for analyses).
To account for the possible role of systematic non-adherence to MDA, the “controlled
correlation” method proposed by Dyson and colleagues is incorporated into the model.8 In
this scheme, the first round of MDA is distributed randomly with probability given as the
treatment coverage c. In each subsequent round k, individual i then receives treatment with
probability pi,k given as:
𝑝𝑖,𝑘 = (𝑐(1 − 𝜌) + 𝜌𝑅𝑖 )/(1 + (𝑘 − 2)𝜌)
Where Ri is the total number of rounds attended by an individual previously, and 𝜌 is the
correlation parameter. If 𝜌 =0, this is the equivalent to all rounds being randomly
distributed (no systematic non-adherence) and if 𝜌 =1 this corresponds to only those
individuals who received the first round of treatment receiving future rounds (complete
systematic non-adherence).
Test uncertainty and decision-making around reaching the TF1-9 threshold (which would
normally determine whether MDA is halted) was not considered here.

Additional results: Estimating impact of 12 month interruption to MDA.
Estimates are based on 1000 simulations for each category, filtered and sampled from an
initial set of simulations to give a uniform distribution between category bounds.
Where the median/mean time to reaching the EPHP threshold without interruption to MDA
is longer than the duration of the simulation (16 years), the delay cannot be estimated here
and is given as NA.

Additional results: Setting 3
An initial set of 4000 simulations was filtered to extract those where after 10 years of MDA,
the prevalence of TF in children aged 1-9 years (TF1-9) was more than 10%, giving a subset
for analysis of at least 1000 simulations for each considered value of the adherencecorrelation parameter 𝜌 (higher values of 𝜌 were not explored as they were considered
unrealistic). Distributions of TF1-9 at baseline, and in 2030 are given in Figure S1, considering
three possible strategies post-2020 (assuming a 2020 interruption to MDA). These are
continuing annual MDA as previously, (scenario II in main text), and mitigation and
acceleration strategies MA1 and MA2 as described in main text.
Table S3. Summary of Setting 3 at baseline. 95% Confidence intervals (CI) are given as 95th centiles.

It is acknowledged that the baseline prevalence estimates for Setting 3 are likely to be lower
than those observed in settings where control has not been achieved after more than 10
years of MDA. This is likely due to the fact that the initial model was fitted and
parameterised using data from settings where rates of transmission is such that annual
MDA has largely been successful.2,3,9 The implications of this are that some model
assumptions (for example reduced infection/disease duration being a function of infection
history and acquired immunity alone and not a combination of age and infection history)
and parameter estimations are less representative of very high transmission settings. This
means that in such settings, the non-linearity in the model of the relationship between the
transmission parameter and baseline TF may mean baseline TF is underestimated. However
the qualitative trends (equilibrium despite annual MDA, shift in this equilibrium with
enhanced MDA) are still relevant. Further model fitting to relevant data is anticipated to
improve the realism of the assumptions and parameter estimates for very high transmission
settings.
