Abstract
Newly proposed SIQR model defines exponent 𝜆 of exponential function expressing daily number
of isolated persons as linear equation of isolation rate q and social distancing ratio x. In order to
dynamically analyze the process of COVID-19 epidemic in seven countries by means of regression
analyses of 𝜆, increasing rate of cumulative isolated persons(cases), IRCC, is proposed as practical
index for the isolation rate q. IRCC is correlated with q in the form of q=C ∙IRCC, where C is a
normalizing coefficient. At first, C is formulated in two modes, one is simple and the other complex,
under the constraint conditions by definition 0≤x, q≤1, which give allowable narrow path of C
between upper and lower boundaries. Then, the dynamic locus of q-x relation is analyzed for each
of seven countries including Japan and the United States using formulated isolation rate q, and
characteristic q-x behavior for each country is derived. At the same time, it is shown that specific
path selection of C gives almost same linear loci of q-x relation derived by mathematical sequential
method imitating a bipedal walk. In addition, increasing rates of cumulative PCR tests, IRCT, for six
countries are discussed in relation with IRCC, and are shown that IRCT contributes to the promotion
of the isolation rate via IRCC.

Introduction
The applicability of newly proposed SIQR model by Odagaki 1) was verified by dynamic analyses2)
using publicly available database for typical seven countries. 𝜆 , the exponent of exponential
function for daily new cases, is defined as a linear expression of isolation rate q and social distancing
ratio x, which is the basic equation in SIQR model and indefinite. This indefinite equation was solved
mathematically by sequential method imitating so-called bipedal walk without any practical and
physical consideration for the isolation rate 2). As a result, the locus of q-x relation during the

progress of infection for each country was able to be determined.
The isolation rate must be a practical and physical meaningful parameter from a viewpoint of
practical use. Therefore, the increasing rate of cumulative cases (IRCC/day) is proposed as an index
with a practical meaning as the isolation rate. First in this work, the analyzing method and database
used in the previous report are briefly reviewed. Then normalizing coefficient C is introduced to
correlate isolation rate q and IRCC as q=C∙IRCC. Further, C is formulated in two modes, one is simple
and the other complex, under the constraint conditions by definition of 0≤x, q≤1, which give
allowable narrow path of C during infection period between upper and lower boundaries of C. Then,
the dynamic locus of q-x relation is analyzed for each of seven countries including Japan and the
United States using formulated isolation rate q, and characteristic q-x behavior of each country is
derived. At the same time, it is shown that specific path selection of C gives almost same loci of linear
q-x relation derived mathematically in the previous report. In addition, increasing rates of
cumulative PCR tests, IRCT, for six countries are discussed in relation with IRCC, and are shown that
IRCT contributes to the promotion of the isolation rate via IRCC.

Basic equation in SIQR model and approaching method in data-fitting
The same analyzing method as previous analyses was taken, the important items of which are
reviewed briefly in the following.
・Basic equation; The number of daily isolated persons (tested as positive and maybe isolated,
hereafter new cases) ΔQ is expressed by logarithmic approximation formula (1) with constant
term 𝛥𝑄 , and λ value was obtained as a coefficient of linear regression. The regression analyzed
daily λ leads to the dynamic capturing of transition of infection process.
𝑙𝑛(𝛥𝑄) = 𝑙𝑛(𝛥𝑄 ) + 𝜆 ∙ 𝑑

(1)

・Definition of exponent λ; In the SIQR model, the exponent λ of eq. (1) is defined by eq. (2).
𝜆 ≡ (1 − 𝑥)𝛽𝑁 − 𝑞 − 𝛾
(2)
Here, βN is a value obtained by multiplying the transmission coefficient β by population N, an index
of the degree of transmission through contact between uninfected and infected persons, x is a
social distancing ratio, and q is an isolation rate. 𝛾 is the cure rate which was set equal to 0.04.
The unit of λ is (1/day), q and βN have the same unit, and x is dimensionless.
・ Approximation in the model; In each of the four groups of S(Susceptible), I(Infected),

Q(Quarantined), and R(Recovered), the degree of impact on infection may differ due to
depopulation, regional differences such as age composition, and differences in measures, even
though, only the average behavior in each country was considered similarly with Odagaki’s
method. Additionally, the epidemic process is regarded as same even though the possibility of
genetically different viruses.
・Analytical procedure; Both the social distancing ratio x and the isolation rate q in eq. (2) are
parameters that take values of 0 to 1 based on their definitions. When both are 0, that is, without
any measures to suppress infection, the right side of eq. (2) becomes βN −γ, which gives the
maximum value λmax (= βN−γ), and the number of new cases increases at the fastest speed. This
relationship is substituted into eq. (2) and transformed to obtain eq. (3).
𝑥 ∙ 𝛽𝑁＋𝑞 ＝𝜆

(3)

− 𝜆 ≡ ∆𝜆

βN associated with the maximum λ is considered as constant throughout the infection period.
Using the right-hand side ∆λ of eq. (3) determined by 𝜆

and daily λ, it is possible to determine

the social distancing ratio x and the isolation rate q.
・Range of regression analyses; The regression analyses for daily λ, increasing rate of cumulative
cases and increasing rate of cumulative tests are performed in the range of [𝑑 − Δ𝑑, 𝑑 + Δ𝑑] at
day 𝑑 , which are set to 19 days with Δd=9. The analysis period is from the day of λmax (start
day) to the convergence day.
・Terminology; The terms frequently used throughout this paper are unified as follows.
Newly infected and isolated persons as new cases, maximum number of new cases as peak, and
the day of minimum number of new cases after peak day as the convergence day.
・Database; The data for following 7 countries are analyzed using the daily isolated cases (new
cases) and PCR tests in more than 200 countries/regions in the "Our World in Data" database 3).
The numbers of new cases and PCR tests were converted to per million people for comparison by
country, and also were moving averaged with one week range.

Increasing rate of cumulative cases from the viewpoint of isolation rate
In the previous analysis, the isolation rate q and the social distancing ratio x were derived as the
mathematical solution of the indefinite equation 2), and linear relation between q and x were
obtained. There was no consideration of isolation rate from a practical and physical point of view in
those analyses, therefore it is necessary to explore the physical basis of isolation rate based on the
practical index for practical application of SIQR model.
The isolation rate q defined in eq. (2) is the index representing the rate of isolation from the group
of infected but unquarantined patients, which directly corresponds to the daily new cases.
Considering two requirements for q, as of 0≤ q≤1 and the unit of (1/day), the increasing rate of daily
new cases is not suitable because it can be positive or negative depending on the daily increase or
decrease. Remaining candidate for isolation rate is the number of new cases per day, which is always
0 or more. However, this number fluctuates largely depending on the method of data tabulation
even after a moving average. Therefore, the increasing rate of the cumulative cases (IRCC)
calculated as a daily slope of the cumulative cases curve, is used as a candidate for isolation rate.
IRCC is more suitable than the number of new cases per day for the purpose of capturing the overall
trend with less fluctuation through a leveling effect by regression.
IRCC is regression analyzed as the daily slope of the cumulative cases curve, and is shown in Figs.

and

convergence days are shown as dots in
the figure, and the days at maximum
increasing rate are located close to the
peak days. IRCC is assumed to be
proportional to the isolation rate q.
Under this assumption, the isolation rate
increases rapidly in all countries from
the start day of maximum value λmax,
when q is zero, and the maximum
isolation rate is recorded near the peak
day. Thereafter, the isolation rate

In the case of the simple mode, the loci of
each of the seven countries on the q-x
coordinates calculated by eqs. (4) and (5)
are shown in Fig. 3, and the daily variation
of q and x for each country are shown in

very early stages of infection even before

are also shown in Figs. 3 and 4 as

in isolation rate for some countries. Each
locus on the q-x coordinate exhibits a
complicated path. In Taiwan and South
Korea, q increases significantly while x is
low in the early stages of infection at the
end of Feb., and q decreases while x
increases after the peak. In Japan, x
increases first, and then q increases.
Germany, Sweden, and Italy exhibit
similar variation with the Japanese type,
however, only x increases with no initial
increase in q, and q increases later. The
US is characterized by the simultaneous
increase in both of q and x and slight
decrease even at the convergence point.

Germany at the end of Feb. may be caused by measures of each country’s policy such as intensive
PCR test implementation in the former and lockdown in the latter. Assessment of these effects by
various measures on q and x requires more detailed examination relating to time series of each
countermeasures. In Taiwan, the social distancing ratio exceeds 1 in the middle of May (Fig. 4b),
which corresponds to the decrease in Ci value crossing the lower boundary corresponding to this
period. As a result of choice for the path of Ci as to pass through the neutral points between the
upper and lower boundaries, the locus of q-x relation does not cross the upper and lower
boundaries throughout the infection period. When the path of C i deviate from the neutral point to
the lower boundary side, the isolation rate decreases, and the social distancing ratio increases as
shown in the case of Taiwan at middle
May, and vice versa.
Figure 5 shows the locus on the q-x
coordinate for the complex mode in
which the Ci value is set to 1/2 of the
upper boundary. In Fig. 5, unlike the
complicated locus in Fig. 3, q and x follow
very simple loci that change linearly,
which is quite similar to the mathematical
result calculated by the bipedal method in
the previous report. In this complex

instead of 1/2.

Therefore, the q-x relationship is a straight line of slope (n-1)/βN, and the differences of the slope

In this way, it became clear that the relationship between q and x varies greatly depending on the

method of determining Ci value that links the isolation rate and IRCC. There is no guideline yet for
determination of Ci path, which remains as a future analysis.

Consideration of isolation rate from the viewpoint of number of PCR tests
The only means of controlling the isolation rate is to rely on tests such as PCR. The isolation rate
is examined based on the viewpoint of PCR tests in this section. Although the definition of the
number of PCR tests differs from country to country, such as the number of people tested or the
number of tests, they were treated equally in this analysis.
Figure

shows

the

relationship

between the number of daily new tests
and the number of daily new cases for
seven countries. In all countries, the
number of new cases increases in
proportion to the number of PCR tests
during the increasing stage (small dots),
and the number of new cases decreases
with the number of tests remaining flat
during the converging stage (a slightly
different trend in the United States and
Italy). This can be interpreted as follows.

Fig. 6 Relationship between daily new cases and
daily new PCR tests for seven countries.
Both numbers are converted to per million people
for comparison by country.

The number of PCR tests increases in response to the increase in the number of new cases in each
country during the increasing stage. Also increasing tests may increase the number of new cases.
When the number of tests can catch up with the increasing number of new cases, then the number
of new cases declines as the isolation progresses, making it unnecessary to increase the number of
tests further. According to this interpretation, the tipping point for the increase/decrease in the
number of new cases (which corresponds to the peak) can be regarded as the point at which the
isolation rate becomes controllable. Therefore, this point can be considered as the saturation point
of the isolation rate, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 such that the peak days locate fairly close to the point
of maximum q.

increase in the number of PCR tests leads
to an increase in the number of isolation,
the rate of increase in the number of tests

control.

to the peak day, and IRCC, which corresponds to the isolation rate, decreases after the peak day.
Germany was excluded from this analysis because of an unusual trend shown in the first half of the
infection stage due to a problem in data tabulation. The slope of the linear relationship between
IRCC and IRCT up to the peak is 0.04 for Taiwan and South Korea, and 0.1 for Japan, while the slope
is a little more than 0.2 for Sweden, the United States and Italy. This slope is an indicator that

isolation rate per unit increase in IRCT,
then can be regarded as a representative
indicator of the isolation efficiency by the
test. In fact, the relationship between this
index and the average positive ratio of the
proportional constant described in Fig. 7,
are almost linear and show a positive
correlation, as shown in Fig. 9. It can be
concluded that the PCR tests were carried
out efficiently in Europe and the United
States where the average positive ratio is
high. In Taiwan, Japan and South Korea

with lower positive ratio, epidemic infection was controlled at low level even though the test
efficiency is low, due to the low transmission coefficient in the former two countries as described in
the previous report, and also due to the intensive test implementation at the early stage of infection
in South Korea (Fig. 4b).

Conclusions
Throughout the previous report and this analysis, the process of COVID-19 epidemic in the seven
countries was dynamically analyzed by applying newly proposed SIQR model to publicly available
database through the analyses of exponent λ of exponential function expressing daily new cases. As
a result, the process from the start to the convergence of infection were clarified as the trends in
isolation rate q and social distancing ratio x for each country. Through these analyses, the
importance of dynamic parameters such as isolation rate q, increasing rate of cumulative
cases(IRCC) and also increasing rate of cumulative PCR tests (IRCT), were emphasized in order to
assess the dynamic transition of epidemic infection based on SIQR model.
・The increasing rate of cumulative cases (tested and isolated persons) IRCC was chosen and
analyzed as a candidate for the isolation rate q with a practical and physical background,

・A normalization coefficient C was introduced in expression q=C∙IRCC to normalize the isolation
rate q, and the social distancing ratio x within the constraint of 0≤ q, x≤1. These constraints gave
another constraint to normalization coefficient C with allowable narrow path between upper and
lower boundaries. q and x were calculated for two types selected for C, a simple mode that traces
the neutral line within this narrow path and a complex mode that traces the upper boundary curve
in a similar fashion.
・Loci on the q-x plane in the simple mode shows a clear difference between countries. Taiwan and
South Korea exhibit rapid increase in isolation rate in the early stages of infection, whereas
countries in Europe exhibit the early increase in the social distancing ratio.
・In the complex mode in which the normalization coefficient C traces the upper boundary curve of
the narrow path, all countries exhibit the linearly varying loci which is almost same with the result
of the mathematical solution with the sequential calculation method simulating the bipedal walking
in the previous report.
・The number of PCR tests was examined in relation with isolation rate, and the increasing rate of
cumulative tests is found to be important as a means to promote the isolation rate.
