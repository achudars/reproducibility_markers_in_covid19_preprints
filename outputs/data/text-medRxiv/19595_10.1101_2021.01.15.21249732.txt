Abstract
Background: Prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19) regarding
households has many aspects, such as buying masks, hand sanitizer, face
shield, and many others. As a result of buying the previous items, the
household spending per month will be increase during the COVID-19
pandemic period.
Aims: To calculate the average costs of each extra item involved in
households spending during COVID-19 pandemic and to predict the total
average extra costs spending by households.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at High Institute of
Public Health (HIPH), University Alexandria. Exponential snowball
sampling was used to recruit students at HIPH and their friends.
Trimming costs was done to remove extreme low and high values. A
regression tree modelling was implemented to predict the total extra costs
spending during COVID-19 pandemic.
Results: Most of the respondents were female (81%) and aged between
30 and 40 (56.3%). About 63.1% of families had the same monthly
income while 35.4% had a decrease in monthly income. A significant
reduction in days of leaving home before and after COVID-19 pandemic
was observed (before; mean= 5.86, after; mean = 4.66, P=0.000). The
extra spending in grocery was the dominated item compared to other
items (mean = 707.2, SD = 530.7). Regarding regression tree, the
maximum average extra costs due to COVID-19 pandemic was 1386
L.E/month (around 88.23$/month) while the minimum average extra
costs was 217 L.E/month (around 13.81$/month).
Conclusions: The effect of COVID-19 pandemic in households
spending varies largely between households, it depends on what they do
to prevent COVID-19.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing
worldwide pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). The virus was started in Wuhan, China but
then it spread to all over the world. On January 2020, the World Health
Organization declared that the COVID-19 outbreak as a global health
emergency. Later, it declared it as a global pandemic (1).
The COVID-19 virus infects all ages. However, older aged people
and patients with underlying medical conditions (such as hypertension,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic
kidney disease, immunocompromised status, cancer, pregnancy, smoking
and obesity) are at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease. Severe
COVID-19 disease causes hospitalization, admission to the ICU,
intubation or mechanical ventilation, or death (2).
Prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19) is through regular hand
washing and covering mouth and nose during sneezing or coughing.
Avoidance of closed spaces and crowded places is also crucial for
prevention of viral spread (3).
From our daily life in Alexandria, Egypt, there are also many
undertaken promotions to prevent COVID-19 such as taking vitamins
(vitamin C, zinc, …), conduct periodic examination, use taxi or uber
instead of public transportation, increase the school expenses due to
COVID-19 and many others. Thus, the main objective of the current
study is to calculate the average extra costs of each item involved in
households spending and to build a model to predict the total average
extra costs spending by households due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Methodology
Study design
A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2020 to November
2020 at High Institute of Public Health (HIPH), University Alexandria.
Sampling design
Exponential snowball sampling technique was done to recruit HIPH
students, their friends and family.
Data collection methods and tools
A pre-design structure questionnaire was created to measure the impact of
COVID-19 situation on the economics of Egyptian households. Content
validity was assessed by three professors at HIPH, they agreed about the
main items that must be asked to measure the average extra costs due to
COVID-19 pandemic which are masks, face shield, treatment of covid-19,
hand wash, chlorine, hand sanitizer, vitamins, periodic examination,
transportation, delivery service, grocery spending, school expenses, and
university expenses.
Data management
The questionnaire was completed by a total of 280 respondents, about 17
(6.1%) individuals submitted more than one application so the duplicates
were excluded from the study, and the remaining were 263 respondents.
The data was collected online using google form.
Data cleaning
After collection data, it is coded and fed to SPSS (statistical
package for the social sciences (IBM® SPSS® Statistics version
25.0).
The costs were trimmed to remove the extreme low and extreme
high values, so only values between 10% percentile and 90%
percentile were entered in calculation.
Calculation of average extra costs for each item per month
• Average cost of masks per month if they bought.

• Average cost of face shield for children if they bought.
o It was assumed that the face shield will bought every 3
months), So the average cost of face shield per month
was calculated as follows:
(Cost of face shield * number of face shield bought)/3
• Average cost of treatment for COVID-19 if someone infected in
the family
o It was assumed that the individual that was infected will
be infected only one time per year, so the average cost of
treatment per month was calculated as follows:
(Cost of treatment * number of individual
infected)/12
• Average extra cost of hand wash per month.
• Average extra cost of chlorine per month.
• Average cost of hand sanitizer if they bought
o It was calculated as follows:
Cost of hand sanitizer * number of bottles used per
month.
• Average costs of taking vitamins per month if they bought
• Average costs of mouth gargle if they bought
o It was assumed that 2 bottles will be used per month, so
average costs of mouth gargle per month was calculated
as follows:
Cost of one bottle * 2
• Average cost of periodic examination per month.
• Average extra cost of using Uber or Taxi instead of public
transportation if they use.
o Increasing cost calculated as: the cost of using uber or
taxi per days for one person in the family subtracting by
the cost of public transportation (around 15 L.E per day)
o The increasing cost was multiplied by 15 days (average
days of coming out from house)
• Average extra cost of using delivery service if they use
o If they were usually use delivery service before COVID19 situation and then stops, it was calculated as follows:
- (delivery service fees (max 20 L.E) * 15 days
o If they were usually not use delivery service before
COVID-19 situation and then use it
(delivery service fees (max 20 L.E) * 15 days
• Average extra cost of grocery spending per month

• Average extra costs of school expenses for children per month
o It was calculated as follows:
Extra costs for all children /12
• Average extra costs of university expenses for students per
month
o It was calculated as follows:
(Extra costs for one student * number of students) /
12

Calculation of Average extra total cost
• Total cost was calculated as follows:
o First: calculate the average extra cost for each item
according to the whole population, this was done by
multiplying each item cost for each individual by the
proportion of the population who paid extra cost for it.
For example: if individual_1 paid for masks 100 L.E,
and 95% of population uses masks, then the cost for
this individual will be 100*.95= 95 L.E
o Second: sum all average extra costs for all items, to
get the total extra costs for each individual.
Statistical analysis

 Descriptive analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated using min, max, mean, and
standard deviation (SD) for the numeric data and frequency, and
percent for categorical data.
Mann-Whitney test was conducted to test the significant difference
between household leaving days before and after COVID-19
pandemic.

 Regression tree modelling

Regression tree modelling technique using CART (Classification
and Regression Trees) algorithm (4) was implemented to build a
prediction model in terms of if-else rules to predict the total
average extra costs spend per month during COVID-19 period
based on its items. The regression tree has root nodes and leaf
nodes. The root nodes represent a single input value (x) and a split

point on that variable, while the leaf nodes represent the output
variable (y). The CART algorithm involving selecting the input
variables is based on a greedy algorithm which depends on
minimization of sum square errors. The analysis was carried out
using the R Statistical Environment (5) through rpart package (6).

The regression tree selected only six items from the 14 items to build the
tree. These items are Grocery, Surface disinfectants, Taxi, Vitamin, Face
shield, and Children. The tree has 8 leaves with a main root which is
Grocery items (Figure 2).

Table 5 shows the decision rules of the regression tree, it can be read as
follows, for example: if you have no increase in Grocery spending and
have no increase in surface disinfectants spending then the average extra
cost of spending per month is 217 L.E. Thus, the minimum average extra
cost spending per month is 217 L.E. and the maximum average extra cost
spending per month is 1386 L.E.

Discussion
During COVID-19 period, a change in household spending has
occurred to prevent the pandemic of COVID-19 for example: buying
extra products such as masks, hand sanitizer, vitamins or changing the
routine of life such as using taxi instead of public transportation or buying
more food due to the long period of staying at home. Therefore, the aim
of the current study is to assess the average extra costs of each items to
predict the total average extra costs in household spending.
The present study reveals that, 11% of families had one person lost
his job compared a survey conducted by Adams-Prassl in late March
2020 shows that 8% of workers having lost their job (7) and another
study found that 3% of employee having lost their job (8). Regarding
income, 62% of households reported reduction in total income (9)
compared to 35.4% in the current study this difference may be due to that
our respondents have high level of education (most of them are working
in medical field) and those with lower levels of education are more likely
to lose their jobs (9).
Regarding to the change of household spending, 49.8% of
households had increase in spending (mean = 1215.6, SD = 560.8) while
14.8% had decrease in spending (mean = 1702.7, SD = 989.24). The
reason for this decrease can clarify as that many activities had been
stopped or delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic.
From Income, Expenditure and Consumption survey, the average
annual expenditure of the family on food and drink in Egypt is 37.1%,
33.9% in urban, and 40.2% in rural of the total annual expenditure, which
is the largest percentage of the family’s expenditure (10). The present

study has similar results, the increasing in grocery spending was the
dominated item during COVID-19 pandemic; has the maximum average
cost change (mean = 707.2, SD = 530.7) compared to other items which
can be understand that with more time spent at home, more food we eat
which led to spend more money. Moreover, physicians stated that more
people reported unexpected weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic
(11).
Concerning regression tree, the minimum average extra cost in
household spending was 217 L.E while the maximum average extra cost
was 1386 L.E, this result can be validated by comparing it with the
change in household spending (min = 200 L.E, max= 2000 L.E).

Limitation
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face data collection was
difficult to do, therefore snowball sampling technique was implemented
to recruit individuals; highly educated only. Thus, this result can be
generalized only among highly educated people.
Recommendation
A phone survey is needed to be conducted to recruit all different
groups in the community.
Conclusion
The effect of COVID-19 pandemic in households spending varies
largely between households, it depends on what they do to prevent
COVID-19.
Ethical consideration
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the
Ethical Committee of High Institute of Public Health in Egypt.
Anonymity and confidentiality of the participants’ data was ensured and
maintained.
