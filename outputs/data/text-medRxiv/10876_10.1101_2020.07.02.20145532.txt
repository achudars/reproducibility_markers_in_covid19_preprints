Abstract

16

Objectives

17

To investigate if the anxiety associated with COVID-19 is a promoting factor to tinnitus.

18

Methods

19

A retrospective research design was used to compare the clinical characteristics of

20

tinnitus between the patients in 2020 under pandemic pressure and those from the

21

matching period in 2019. While anxiety was quantified using the Zung’s Self-rating

22

Anxiety Scale (SAS), tinnitus severity was evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap

23

Inventory (THI) questionnaire and the test of minimum masking level (MML). The

24

assessments were repeated after the sound therapy plus educational counselling (STEC)

25

and compared with EC alone therapy.

26

Results

27

A large increase in anxiety was evident in 2020 in both case rate and SAS. The treatment

28

of both methods was less effective in 2020. SAS, THI and MML were all deteriorated

29

after the EC alone treatment in 2020, while an improvement was seen in 2019. This

30

suggests that EC alone could not counteract the stress by COVID-19 at all, and the stress,

31

if not managed well, can significantly increase the severity of tinnitus and associated

32

anxiety.

33

Conclusions

34

By using the EC subgroup in virtual control, we conclude that anxiety can serve as a

35

promoting factor to tinnitus. We believe that this is the first study report that confirm the

36

causative/promotive role of anxiety on tinnitus.

Introduction

40

The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already reached pandemic

41

proportions, affecting the majority of countries, areas, and territories across the world

42

(Remuzzi et al., 2020) . By the end of June 2020, over nine million people had tested

43

positive for COVID-19 with the death toll increasing to more than 484,000 globally

44

(World Health Organization, 2020) . Decisive containment measures in China have

45

reduced new cases and the spread of infection (Liu et al., 2020). However, worries about

46

the spread of the disease, living difficulties, and financial burden related to the pandemic

47

are likely to have had negative psychosocial impacts on residents, as reported by many

48

recent studies (Brooks et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b). It would be

49

reasonable, therefore, to expect an increase in the incidence of disorders that are

50

associated with psychological issues.

51

Tinnitus is typically referred to as the perception of sound in the absence of an

52

acoustic stimulus or that is only generated by structures in the ear, commonly described

53

as ringing in one or both ears (Bauer, 2018). While the exact mechanisms of tinnitus

54

remain unclear, many risk or promoting factors have been identified, including

55

sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular schwannoma, ototoxic medications, and emotional

56

stress (Baguley et al., 2013). Tinnitus has been linked to stress and related disorders in

57

many previous studies. This link has been thoroughly reviewed, repeatedly, by different

58

authors (e.g., (Durai et al., 2016; Malouff et al., 2011; Mazurek et al., 2019; Pattyn et al.,

59

2016; Wallhausser-Franke et al., 2012; Ziai et al., 2017; Zirke et al., 2013)). The direction

60

and causality of this link remain unclear, as pointed out in many previous studies,

61

although individuals’ emotional states appear to be an important factor mediating the

62

effects of tinnitus loudness on tinnitus-related distress (Probst et al., 2016a; Probst et al.,

63

2016b; Schlee et al., 2016); anxiety, somatization, and in particular depression have also

64

been identified as possible mediators of tinnitus-related distress (Bartels et al., 2010a;

65

Bartels et al., 2010b; Trevis et al., 2016a; Trevis et al., 2016b).

66

The clinicians in our department noticed that the tinnitus patients seen since the

67

hospital was reopened after COVID-19 had more emotional complaints than before. We

68

thought that this might be related to the various pressures experienced by the patients

69

during the pandemic event and the lockdown. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic and

70

lockdown might provide a good opportunity to investigate whether anxiety impacts

71

tinnitus as a promoting or enhancing factor. The present study explored whether anxiety

72

was increased by the COVID-19 pandemic in subjects with tinnitus, and if so whether the

73

increased anxiety affected the severity of tinnitus and the outcomes of tinnitus treatments.

74

Methods

75

Study Design

76

In this retrospective study, clinical data from outpatients visiting our department (the

77

Hearing Center of Otolaryngology Department of the Sichuan Provincial People’s

78

Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, People’s

79

Republic of China) were collected over the same periods, from March 1 to April 14, in

80

both 2020 and 2019. This period in 2020 was the first 6 weeks of the reopening of our

81

department to non-emergency visits after the nationwide lockdown for COVID-19 in

82

China (from January 23 to February 29, 2020) that coincided with the deceleration phase

83

of the pandemic and the resumption of economic activities. In this period, there were

84

concerns about a resurgence of COVID-19 (Bedford et al., 2020).

85

The same protocol was followed for the treatment of patients during both years. On

86

the initial visit, after collecting their history, every patient received a comprehensive

87

audiological and psychological assessment. After the assessment, they were treated with

88

one of three methods based on reported efficacy, financial cost, and the patient’s

89

preference: sound therapy (ST) with educational counseling (EC) or relaxation

90

therapy, sound amplification with EC and relaxation therapy, or EC and relaxation

91

therapy without further treatment. Two months after the initial appointment, every

92

participant was examined in a second assessment. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the

93

major procedures of this study. Although no procedure was experimental, we sought and

94

received approval for the study from the Ethics Review Board of the Sichuan Provincial

95

People’s Hospital and Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences (permit number: 2020–355).

96

This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of

97

Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2018).

Audiological Tests and Tinnitus Evaluation

103

The procedures for all tests were explained to the patients before they were

104

conducted. All patients were examined using monocular otoscopy to identify any sign of

105

blockage or inflammation in ear canals or perforation in the tympanic membrane.

106

Tympanometry was tested at the most common 226 Hz probe tone, using an AT235

107

impedance meter (Interacoustics, Assens, Denmark); the type of tympanogram was

108

determined for each ear (with type A as normal). Those who were abnormal in those tests

109

were not included in this study.

110

The hearing status was tested with pure-tone audiometry (AC40, Interacoustics) in a

111

soundproofed room. The air conduction threshold was examined for frequencies ranging

112

from 250 Hz to 8 kHz using TDH 39 headphones (Telephonics, NY, USA) and bone

113

conduction hearing was examined from 500 Hz to 4 kHz using a B-72 bone-conduction

114

vibrator (Radioear, PA, USA), each in octave steps. The hearing thresholds were

115

determined at each frequency using the standard Hughson–Westlake up–down procedure.

116

Thresholds of 20 dB HL or lower were considered normal. The minimum masking level

117

(MML) was tested in each ear with tinnitus, this test evaluates the maskability of tinnitus

118

by external sounds. Broadband noise with a flat power spectrum was used for this

119

evaluation, which was generated by a table-top sound generator (BTD01, BetterLife

120

Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China). To measure the MML, the level of the

121

noise was gradually increased by the tester in 1 dB steps until the patient stated that the

122

tinnitus had become nearly inaudible, then this level was recorded as the MML.

123

Educational Counseling and Relaxation Therapy

124

The counseling was performed by the audiologists for each patient with tinnitus to

125

acknowledge the patient’s suffering, and to help the patient understand tinnitus,

126

demystify the condition, and correct any false preconceptions (duration 1 h) (Langguth,

127

2015). Relaxation therapy consisted of home-based exercises, such as listening to music,

128

avoiding unnecessary tension, and tai chi (Arif et al., 2017; Tyler, 2014). Patients were

129

advised to execute this for two sessions of 30 min per day over a period of 8 weeks.

130

Sound Therapy

131

The first step of the ST was to identify the nature of the tinnitus in pitch and loudness.

132

Pitch matching was conducted using the same sound generator (BTD01) as in the MML

133

test to produce pure tones for tonal tinnitus or narrow-band noise for non-tonal tinnitus.

134

The match was established by adjusting the central frequency and bandwidth, which

135

could be changed from 100 Hz to 1 kHz, around the center frequency. In loudness

136

matching, the matched tone or noise was presented continuously, and the level of the

137

matching signal was adjusted from low to high until the tinnitus could hardly be heard. In

138

this report, loudness matching results are presented in dB SL. Using the pitch and

139

loudness matching data, a sound file was generated for each individual to produce a

140

sound matching their tinnitus in frequency and level. This sound file was the uploaded to

141

an ear level sound generator (BTM-N6, BetterLife Medical Technology Co., Ltd.) that

142

was dispensed to the patient. The patients were instructed to listen to the sound file for

143

30 min each time, and to gradually increase from once to 3–6 times per day, every day,

144

during the whole course of home-based therapy, which lasted for 2 months.

145

Questionnaires

146

The tinnitus patients recruited in this study all completed two questionnaires at the

147

initial visit and again during the follow-up, two months later. The Chinese version of the

148

Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) questionnaire was used in this study (Kam et al.,

149

2009), consisting of 25 questions to assess the difficulty caused by tinnitus with respect

150

to its functional, emotional, and catastrophic aspects (Meng et al., 2012; Newman et al.,

151

1996).

152

A Chinese version of Zung’s Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire was used,

153

which was adapted from a previous report (Gao et al., 2011; Zung, 1965). The raw scores

154

were multiplied by 1.25 to generate the index scores (Zung, 1965). We used a value of 45

155

as the cut-off for anxiety, instead of 50, as reported in the most recent publication

156

(Dunstan et al., 2020).

157

Statistical Analyses

158

All parametric data are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise

159

specified. When the parameters of participants were compared between two groups, the t-

160

test was used or, if among multiple groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for

161

continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables, including sex, age,

162

and site of tinnitus, and for risk factors among groups. Treatment outcomes were

163

evaluated by comparing the scores of THI and SAS before and after the treatments, using

164

a paired t-test or ANOVA. All analyses were performed using the SPSS 19.0.0 software at

165

a significance level of 0.05. In figures, the significant level was indicated by the number

166

of symbols (e.g., *), with 1, 2 or 3 representing p <0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 respectively.

167
168

Results

169

A total of 99 cases were collected between March 1 and April 14, 2020, and 89 in the

170

same period in 2019 (Figure 1). Table 1 compares the demographics and tinnitus

171

characteristics between the subjects in the different years. The case load for tinnitus

172

appeared to be higher in 2020 than in the same period in 2019 (99 vs. 89, or an increase

173

of 11.2%). Such an increase could be largely attributed to the accumulation of cases when

174

all the non-emergency visits were suspended during the lockdown between January and

175

February 2020. The two groups of different years were matched by all clinical

The increase in Anxiety in 2020 and its impact on THI and MML

184

In the 2020 group, 74 out of 99 (or 74.7%) subjects had an SAS higher than 45 (the

185

criterion for anxiety), which was significantly higher than that in the 2019 group (53/89,

186

or 59%, χ2 = 4.938, p = 0.026). Overall, the SAS score in 2020 group was significantly

187

higher than that of 2019 group (61.9 ± 11.9 in 2020 versus 49.1 ± 8.6 in 2019; U = 6867

188

via Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, p < 0.001, Figure 2A), which was fully due to the

189

difference in the anxiety subgroups (68.0 ± 6.4 in 2020 vs. 54 ± 8 in 2019; U = 3550 via

190

Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, p < 0.001, Figure 2A). Therefore, the higher SAS in 2020

was not simply due to the higher incidence of subjects with anxiety, but also the higher

192

level of anxiety in the involved subjects.

and MML; no difference was seen in THI between anxiety and non-anxiety subgroups within 2019, while a

200

higher MML was seen in non-anxiety subgroup within 2019. THI: tinnitus handicap inventory, SAS:

202

The THI score in the 2020 group was 40.1 ± 6.9, which was significantly higher than

203

that in the 2019 group (34 ± 8.3) as shown by the group effect in a two-way ANOVA

204

against year group and anxiety (F1, 184 = 16.278, p < 0.001). The ANOVA also

205

demonstrated a significant effect of anxiety: 38.8 ± 8.6 for subjects with anxiety and

206

33.8 ± 7.5 for those without (F1, 184 = 11.628, p < 0.001, Figure 2B). However, there was

207

not a significant interaction between two factors (F1, 184 = 2.3, p = 0.131). Post-hoc

208

pairwise comparisons showed that the THI score of anxiety subgroup in 2020 was

209

41.7 ± 7.7, which was significantly higher than the corresponding subgroup in 2019

210

(34.8 ± 8.1; q = 6.904, p < 0.001), and that of non-anxiety subgroup in 2020 (35.6 ± 5;

211

q = 4.766, p < 0.001, Figure 2C). Interestingly, the THI of non-anxiety subgroup in 2020

212

was (almost) same as that of the anxiety subgroup in 2019. However, there was no

213

significant difference in THI score across the non-anxiety subgroups between years

214

(Figure 2C).

215

The between-year difference in THI was further analyzed using a breakdown of the

216

scores in the emotional, functional, and catastrophic questionnaire sections. A significant

217

between-year difference was demonstrated in the emotional score (14.636 ± 3.7 in 2020

218

and 12.3 ± 3.3 in 2019; the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test, U = 5942.5, p < 0.001), in the

219

functional score (18.515 ± 3.6 in 2020 and 15.5 ± 4.2 in 2019, U = 5211.5, p < 0.001) and

220

in the catastrophic scores (7.0 ± 2.5 vs. 6.1 ± 2.6, U = 5173, p = 0.035). This result

221

suggests that the higher THI in 2020 could be partially related to the increase in anxiety.

222

A two-way ANOVA similar to that for THI showed a significant year effect with

223

subjects in 2020 had significantly lower MMLs (8.3 ± 3.5 dB SL) as compared to those in

224

the 2019 group (10.4 ± 4.3 dB SL; F1, 184 = 21.745, p < 0.001). However, the effect of

225

anxiety was not significant (F1, 184 = 0, p = 0.977; Figure 2D). The higher MML in 2019

226

could be largely attributed to the high MML in the non-anxiety subgroup this year as

227

demonstrated by

228

subgroups had a higher MML (11.7 ± 4.1 dB SL) in 2019 than the patients with anxiety in

229

2019 (9.5 ± 4.3 dB SL, q = 3.627, p < 0.001, Figure 2E). Within 2020, however, the

230

anxiety subgroup had an MML of 8.9 ± 3.7 dB SL, which was slightly but significantly

231

higher than the non- anxiety subgroup this year (6.7 ± 2.0 dB SL, q = 3.441, p = 0.015;

232

Figure 2E). The result suggests that there is no clear indication whether anxiety played a

233

role in the loudness of tinnitus.

the Post-hoc pairwise test, which showed that the non-anxiety

234

Pearson correlation was conducted between SAS and THI and MML respectively in

235

each year. In 2020, a weak positive correlation was seen between SAS and catastrophic

236

THI (r = 0.319, p = 0.001), but not to another two subscales of THI. In this year there is

237

also a moderate correlation between SAS and MML (r = 0.337, p < 0.001). In 2019,

238

however, the significant correlation was seen in any pair of measurement (p > 0.05).

242

numbers of patients who received ST with EC (STEC), hearing aids with EC (HAEC), or

243

EC alone were 38, 14, and 42, respectively in the 2020 group, while the respective

244

numbers were 58, 10, and 17 in the 2019 group. Due to the small sample sizes in patients

245

receiving hearing aids in 2020, we only analyzed the treatment outcomes of STEC and

246

EC alone. No between-year differences were seen in basic demographic features, risk

247

factors and duration of tinnitus between the years in subjects treated with STEC (Table 2)

248

and EC alone (Table 3). The incidence of anxiety in the patients receiving STEC was

The effect of treatment on SAS

264

Figure 3 summarized the effect of the two treatments on SAS. In consistency with

265

the data of whole sample (Figure 2A), the pre-treatment SAS was much higher in 2020

266

than in 2019 for the subjects treated with both STEC (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, U

267

= 411, p < 0.001, Figure 3A) and EC alone (U = 460.5, p = 0.031, Figure 3C). However,

268

the effect of EC alone on SAS appeared to be qualitatively different from that of STEC in

269

that the SAS was not decreased (improved) but increased in 2020 group after the

270

treatment (Figure 3C), so that the post-treatment SAS in the 2020 group (63 ± 11) was

271

even significantly higher than the before-treatment SAS in the 2019 group (52.9 ± 10,

272

Mann–Whitney rank-sum test, U = 527, p < 0.004). This raised the question whether and

273

how the number of subjects qualified as having anxiety changed after each treatment.

274

Such changes were summarized in Table 4. In 2019, a large portion of subjects who had

275

anxiety changed to non-anxiety status after either of the two treatments. In 2020, however,

276

the number of cases with anxiety was increased, slightly after STEC, but largely after EC

alone. In each method, there was a significant difference between years in the % change

of cases with anxiety.

282

The SAS was significantly reduced in both years after the STEC treatment (Mann-

283

Whitney Rank Sum Test, p < 0.001). However, due to the large initial difference, the

284

post-treatment SAS score in the 2020 group (58.0 ± 10.6) was still significantly higher

285

than the pre-treatment SAS in the 2019 group (48.3 ± 8.5, Mann–Whitney rank-sum test,

286

U = 534, p < 0.001). These results suggest that the anxiety associated with COVID-19

287

was not been fully counteracted by the treatment.

treatment reduced SAS in both years (A). However, EC alone did not improve SAS in 2020, instead the

SAS was increased significantly in the 2nd assessment (C). Correspondingly, STEC produced a slightly

better improvement in SAS in 2019 than in 2020, but improvement by EC alone was much better in 2019

298

performed on the pre-post SAS difference against the factor of year group and anxiety

299

(Figure 3B). A significant year difference was seen since the SAS improvement appeared

300

to be slightly but significantly smaller in 2020 (5.0 ± 8.6) than in 2019 (6.1 ± 3.8,

301

F1, 92 = 6.046, p = 0.016). Combined with the higher initial SAS in 2020, this implies that

302

the higher initial anxiety in 2020 may have made the treatment less effective in reducing

303

anxiety. However, this assumption is conflicted with the fact that the subjects with

304

anxiety gained more reduction in SAS after STEC (6.6 ± 6.2 in the subjects with anxiety

305

vs. 4.0 ± 5.9 in the non-anxiety subjects; effect of anxiety: F1, 92 = 10.447, p = 0.002).

306

Furthermore, the post-hoc test within 2020 revealed a larger SAS reduction (7.0 ± 8.0) in

307

the anxiety subgroup this year than the non-anxiety subgroup in which the SAS was

308

increased (negative improvement: -1.5 ± 7.2, post-hoc test within 2020, Tukey method; q

309

= 5.364, p < 0.001). This result was in sharp contrast with the null difference in the SAS

310

improvement between the anxiety subgroup (6.6 ± 6.2) and the non-anxiety subgroup

311

(6.0 ± 3.5) in 2019 (Figure 3B).

312

A two-way ANOVA similar to the STEC was done for EC alone and showed a

313

significant effect of year group: the pre-post difference in SAS in 2020 was negative (-3.4

314

± 4.6, for an worse SAS) as compared with the large improvement in 2019 (7.1 ± 7.5; F1,

315

55

316

was not significantly different from that in the subgroup receiving EC alone this year (63

317

± 12 versus 59.5 ± 12.1; Mann–Whitney rank-sum test, U = 640.5, p = 0.129), the

318

deteriorated SAS after EC alone suggests that the subjects in the EC subgroup in 2020

319

had experienced an increased stress after the first assessment, and the stress largely

320

increased anxiety, which was not counteracted by the EC alone treatment. A significant

321

effect of anxiety was also seen in subjects treated with EC alone: the SAS change after

322

EC was 1 ± 7.4 in patients with anxiety before EC and -4 ± 6 in those without (F1, 55 =

323

11.038, p = 0.002). There was no significant interaction between the two factors (F1, 55 =

324

2.773, p = 0.102). The large deterioration in SAS in the non-anxiety subjects received EC

325

is obviously due to such change in 2020 in which the SAS changes in the non-anxiety

326

subjects was -5.4 ± 5.7, although this value was not significantly different from the

327

change in non-anxiety subgroup in 2019 (0.5 ± 4.9; post-hoc test, q = 2.813, p = 0.052;

328

Figure 3D). In both years, SAS improvement was smaller in the non-anxiety subgroups,

329

and in 2020, SAS was deteriorated, instead of improved, in both anxiety and non-anxiety

330

subgroups. In 2019, the SAS improvement in the anxiety subgroup 9.1 ± 7.1, which was

331

significantly higher than the non-anxiety subgroup (0.5 ± 4.9) (post hoc test, via Tukey

332

Method, q = 4.084, p = 0.006). In 2020, the SAS change in the anxiety subgroup was -

333

2.5 ± 3.8, and that in the non-anxiety subgroup was -5.4 ± 5.7. However, the difference

334

was not significant (post hoc test, Tukey method, q = 2.324, p = 0.106). To further

335

evaluate the impact of anxiety on clinic features of tinnitus, Pearson product moment

336

correlation was calculated between the initial SAS score and the changes after the

337

treatment. There was a moderate, positive, linear relationship between the initial SAS

338

score and the change in patients receiving STEC in 2020 (r = 0.511, p = 0.001), but no

339

significant correlation was found in 2019 (Figure 4A). In addition, a moderate and

340

positive linear relationship was also seen between the initial SAS score and the change in

341

patients receiving EC alone in 2020 (r = 0.413, p = 0.006; Figure 4B) but not in 2019 (r =

342

0.488, p = 0.071). These results suggest that the treatment was more effective for

343

mitigating anxiety in subjects with higher SAS scores in 2020, which was associated with

in 2020 group than in 2019 in subjects treated with both methods (Table 5). However,

STEC resulted in a significant THI reduction in both years (A), but there was no significant difference in

to 28.7 ± 7.6 (via Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, W = -1590, p < 0.001) as shown in Figure

373

5A. Figure 5B summarized the result of a two-way ANOVA on the improvement of THI

374

(the pre-THI minus post-THI) by STEC against the factor of year group and anxiety.

375

There was no significant effect for both factors (year effect: F1, 92 = 2.104, p = 0.15;

376

anxiety effect: F1, 92 = 0.09, p = 0.759).

377

Surprisingly, the THI scores in 2020 rose from 39.8 ± 8.9 to 42.1 ± 9.1 after EC

378

alone treatment (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, W = 426, p < 0.001), while an

379

improvement was seen in 2019 from 35.7 ± 5.2 to 30.2 ± 6.3 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank

380

Test, W = -153, p < 0.001, Figure 5C). Therefore, the change in THI by EC alone was -

381

2.2 ± 2.9 in 2020, but 5.4 ± 6.9 in 2019, as shown by the significant year effect in the

382

two-way ANOVA (F1, 55 = 25.73, p < 0.001). In this ANOVA, the effect of anxiety was

383

not significant (Figure 5D). Correspondingly, the between-year difference in THI

384

improvement was larger in anxiety subjects than non-anxiety ones (post hoc tests, q =

385

7.323, p < 0.001 in anxiety between year and q = 4.031 p =0.006 in non-anxiety between

386

year).

387

Correlation analysis showed a moderate and positive linear relationship between the

388

improvements of THI in the emotional subscale and the SAS improvement in the subjects

389

treated with STEC in both 2020 (r = 0.506, p = 0.001) and 2019 (r = 0.623, p < 0.001;

407

the difference was not statistically significant as shown by the main effect of year in a

408

two-way ANOVA ( F1, 92 = 1.513, p = 0.222, Figure 7B). Neither a significant effect of

409

anxiety was seen in this ANOVA (F1, 92 = 0.006, p = 0.935).

410

Like THI, EC alone treatment in 2020 did not reduced MML, but increased it from

411

10.9 ± 4.9 dB SL to 12.4 ± 5.8 dB SL (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, W = 172, p = 0.003),

412

yielding an increase of 1.5 ± 3.1 (Figure 7D). This was opposite to the decrease in MML

413

from 12.4 ± 4.9 dB SL to 10.3 ± 4.7 in 2019 (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, W = -91, p <

414

0.001; Figure 7C). Correspondingly, a significant year effect was seen in a two-way

415

ANOVA (F1, 55 = 10.036, p = 0.003), which did not show a significant effect of anxiety

416

(F1, 55 = 1.944, p = 0.169). However, the year difference was mainly due to the between-

417

year difference in the anxiety subjects in the post-hoc test (Tukey method, q = 5.24, p <

418

0.001), since no significant difference was seen in non-anxiety subjects between years (q

419

= 2.129, p > 0.05, Figure 7D). Moreover, correlation analyses did not show any

420

significant correlation between initial SAS and the change of MML after both treatment

421

in each of the two years. Those results suggest that high anxiety in 2020 made EC alone

422

treatment ineffective in mitigating loudness of tinnitus. The overall correlations between

423

SAS improvements and THI (with subscale THI), MML improvements by two treatment

424

methods in two years were seen in Table 6.

Discussion

429

Several interesting findings were seen in this retrospective study. (1) We

430

demonstrated a significantly increased anxiety in the tinnitus subjects seen in 2020 in

431

terms of the incidence of subjects with anxiety (Table 1) and the averaged SAS (Figure

432

2A). Based upon the significant between-year difference, this increase in anxiety is

433

clearly associated with COVID-19 pandemic. (2) The high SAS was associated with a

434

high THI score, especially in the emotional subscale in 2020 as compared with the values

435

of 2019 (Figure 2B and 2C), suggesting that the increased psychological stress in 2020

436

does enhance tinnitus. (3) However, the increased anxiety was not clearly linked to

437

measure of tinnitus loudness by MML (Figure 2D and 2E). (4) Overall, the treatments of

438

both STEC and EC alone were less effective in 2020 in anxiety reduction (Table 4 and

439

Figure 3B and 3D) and in the self-reported mitigation of tinnitus (Table 5). In fact, the

440

anxiety was even worse after the treatment in 2020, especially in those who received EC

441

alone. This suggested that an increased stress was experienced by the subjects in 2020

442

group after the first assessment, which could not be counteracted by the therapy. (5)

443

There was no significant difference between years for the reduction of tinnitus severity as

444

measured by THI and MML by STEC (Figure 4B and 5B). (6) However, the treatment of

445

EC alone was much less effective in reducing THI and MML, and in 2020 it resulted in a

446

deterioration increase in anxiety (Table 4, Figures 3D, 4D), THI (Figure 5D) and in MML

447

(Figure 7D). Since EC alone did show benefit in 2019, the deterioration in 2020 suggests

448

that the anxiety in 2020 largely enhanced tinnitus, and made it difficult to be managed.

449

There is no doubt that a significant psychological stress was developed because of

450

the COVID-19 pandemic. Many recently published articles have revealed the high

451

prevalence of anxiety across China during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 28.8% to 35.1%

452

(Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a), as compared to the previously reported

453

prevalence of 5.6% and 7.6% for the years of 2009 and 2019, respectively (Huang et al.,

454

2019; Phillips et al., 2009). A cross-sectional survey, using the same anxiety

455

questionnaire as adapted in the present study, reported an average SAS score of

456

45.89 ± 1.1 among front-line clinical staff during the pandemic (Wu et al., 2020). This

457

value was located between the scores for our subjects with and without anxiety

458

(68.0 ± 6.0 vs. 43.9 ± 1.5), and lower than the average for all subjects in the 2020 group

459

(61.9 ± 11.9). This implies that our tinnitus patients seen in 2020 have experienced

460

extremely high psychological pressure, even higher than those medical doctors who were

461

in the most challenging job during the pandemic. The number of tinnitus subjects seen in

462

the 6-week period in 2020 was higher than that last year. However, this increase may be

463

largely attributable to the accumulation of patients during the hospital closure in the

464

national lockdown.

465

The association between tinnitus and anxiety has been investigated in many previous

466

studies and has been well reviewed (Durai et al., 2016; Malouff et al., 2011; Mazurek et

467

al., 2019; Pattyn et al., 2016; Wallhausser-Franke et al., 2012; Ziai et al., 2017; Zirke et

468

al., 2013). However, no information is available on the direction and causality between

469

the two ends of the link (Danioth et al., 2020; Lugo et al., 2020; Mazurek et al., 2019;

470

Park et al., 2019b; Wallhausser-Franke et al., 2012), although many studies have implied

471

that psychological states, such as those related to common stressors, influence perception

472

of, or coping with tinnitus (Lazarus, 1993; Lazarus, 2000). In this regard, two related

473

systems are involved in tinnitus: (1) the brain regions along the hypothalamic–pituitary–

30

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.20145532; this version posted August 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

474

adrenal axis (see reviews (Mazurek et al., 2019; Ziai et al., 2017)), which is the main

475

neuroendocrine system involved in stress response, and (2) the limbic system including

476

the hippocampus and amygdala, which regulates the perception of tinnitus and the

477

adaptation (thereby, the ability to cope with stress) (Chen et al., 2017; Kapolowicz et al.,

478

2019; Leaver et al., 2016; Lockwood et al., 1998; Raghavan et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,

479

2015). While the data from the previous studies have indicated the possible role of

480

emotional factors in tinnitus via those systems, the relationship was mostly investigated

481

in animal models, or in cross-sectional comparisons across subjects with different levels

482

of tinnitus and those without, with focus on establishing the connection, rather than on

483

the directional nature of the link.

484

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a good opportunity to investigate whether stress

485

or anxiety could enhance tinnitus as a causative or promotive factor, by clearing some

486

clouds. For example, in many of the previous studies, the effect of anxiety on tinnitus

487

were evaluated in a special population, such as those in veterans (Hu et al., 2015), in

488

elderly (Danioth et al., 2020), in those with headache (Lugo et al., 2020), and those with

489

sleeping disorders (Xu et al., 2016a). In other extreme, the link was investigated in cross-

490

sectional studies in which the anxiety cases of different causes was included (Park et al.,

491

2019a). Moreover, the anxiety has been evaluated with many different methods, including

492

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (McKenna et al., 2017), Beck Anxiety Index

493

(Mahboubi et al., 2017), as well as SAS (Xu et al., 2016b). All those variations make it

494

difficult to generalize a finding, if reported, for the directional nature of the link between

495

anxiety and tinnitus. Although large variation existed across different individuals in

496

relationship to their jobs and financial situations, as well as their closeness to COVID-19

497

patients, the stress factor associated with this study was much more homogeneous than

498

those that had been examined in previous studies. Moreover, it has been shared by

499

general population rather than impacting on small groups. In addition, the same

500

methodologies were used over the two years, which ensured a valid comparison for

501

verifying the impact of anxiety associated with COVID-10. We therefore think that the

502

between-year differences in the tinnitus clinic afforded a good chance to verify whether

503

anxiety plays a causative or promotive role for tinnitus.

504

In the present study, at least three lines of evidence pinpointed the

505

causative/promotive role of anxiety on tinnitus. Firstly, the high anxiety (in both the case%

506

and SAS) was associated with the higher THI in all three subscales in 2020. Secondly, the

507

high anxiety reduced the effectiveness of the tinnitus treatment in 2020 as compared with

508

2019 result, in the change of SAS (Figure 3B and 3D), the case% of subjects with anxiety

509

(Table 4), self-reported improvement in tinnitus loudness (Table 5) and THI (Figure 4D).

510

The results in Table 4 indicate a sharp contrast in the changes of cases with anxiety after

511

the treatments between years: an increase of 6.89% by STEC in 2020 versus a decrease of

512

53.1% in 2019, an increase of 24.1% by EC alone in 2020 versus a decline of 46.2% in

513

2019. The between-year differences indicates that the higher-level stress in 2020 affected

514

the efficacy of the two treatments in mitigating anxiety. Furthermore, the self-reported

515

improvement in tinnitus loudness (Table 5) was also significantly less in 2020 in both

516

treatments. Thirdly, the promoting/enhancing effect of anxiety on tinnitus was indicated

517

by the significant difference in the treatment effectiveness between STEC and EC alone.

518

To evaluate the full impact of the stress on tinnitus, an untreated control group would be

519

ideally used. Unfortunately, we do not have such control. However, the EC alone

520

treatment was given for only one time of 30-60 minutes session over the whole 2 months.

521

This was not a comprehensive therapy by any means. Therefore, the EC subgroup could

522

be used as a virtually no-treatment control, although this method exerted a “better than

523

nothing” effect in 2019. We found a significant increase in SAS in the subjects treated

524

with EC alone in 2020, while a reduction in SAS in the STEC subgroup. Since the initial

525

SAS was not different between the subjects treated with the different methods, this

526

difference suggests that there was an increased or accumulated anxiety during the two

527

months after the first assessment in 2020, which could not be counteracted by EC alone

528

treatment. There were no significant between-year differences in the change of THI and

529

MML by STEC. However, the THI and MML got worse in 2020 EC alone subgroup in

530

association with a large increase in SAS, while the same treatment somehow improved

531

both THI and MML in 2019. These results suggest that the increased stress, if not treated

532

effectively, have significantly enhanced the tinnitus in 2020.

533

EC is a psychological treatment that was often recommended in combination with

534

other treatments, like sound therapy or hearing aid fitting (Brennan-Jones et al., 2020;

535

Jastreboff et al., 2000). However, different effectiveness of EC alone was also reported in

536

some studies. For instance, an early study reported a successful ratio of 18% in tinnitus

537

release (Jastreboff et al., 1996); while another study reported a significant THI reduction

538

from 46.11 ± 22.74 to 31.94 ± 20.41 (Liu et al., 2018). In the present study, the THI was

539

reduced by 5.4 ± 6.9 after EC alone treatment in 2019. This result demonstrates the

540

effectiveness of our EC treatment, while the quantitative difference between our data and

541

others may reflect the detail difference in EC procedures and other factors such as subject

542

variables. Anyway, the EC alone treatment reduced SAS (Figure 3D), THI (Figure 5D)

543

and MML (Figure 7D) in 2019. However, the change of SAS, THI and MML occurred in

544

the opposite direction after the EC in 2020. The between-year difference validates the use

545

of EC alone as a virtual control because it is obvious that this treatment was not sufficient

546

to counteract the effect of anxiety.

547

Limitations

548

There were several limitations to our study. Firstly, this was a retrospective study in

549

which only the SAS was used to evaluate anxiety. This makes it difficult to compare our

550

study with previous ones. Secondly, STEC was compared with EC alone without the use

551

of wait-list control, making it difficult to fully evaluate the impact of anxiety on tinnitus.

552

Thirdly, more patients in 2020 selected EC alone treatment probably due to the financial

553

constraints, which may have produced some bias in comparison with 2019 subgroup. Last

554

but not least, the overall sample size in the present study was small as the data were

555

collected only from one hospital within a limited period. Although the data and

556

conclusion are solid in the present study, further investigation would be helpful to verify

557

the conclusion with a larger sample.

558

Currently, the link between anxiety and tinnitus was more evaluated in the direction

559

of how tinnitus, as a stressor, can interact with (pre-existing) psychological disorders and

560

change the subjects responses to them (Kroner-Herwig et al., 2006), but was not

561

emphasized on the direction whether other stressors would enhance tinnitus. This has

562

been reflected in evaluation tools. For example, the THI questions for the emotional

563

subscale (e.g., Question 22: Does your tinnitus make you feel anxious) obviously ask the

564

impact of tinnitus on emotion, but there is no question asking whether a stressor changes

565

the severity of tinnitus (Newman et al., 2008). This bias appears to be a limitation for

566

investigating the causative role of anxiety or stressor on tinnitus, and is likely one of the

567

reasons why there was only a week correlation between the large increase in SAS in 2020

568

and the THI in the initial assessment. In future investigation, THI questionnaire should be

569

revised accordingly.

570

Conclusion

571

A substantial increase in anxiety was seen in tinnitus subjects in 2020 in association

572

with COVID-19 pandemic and was evident as a promoting factor to tinnitus. The increase

573

in SAS was associated with a smaller increase of THI in 2020, but not by the difference

574

in MML. However, the difference in treatment effect between STEC and EC alone

575

suggested that, the tinnitus severity was increased (in both THI and MML) when it was

576

not comprehensively treated (such as by EC alone). Therefore, the present study provided

577

clear evidence for the promoting effect of anxiety on tinnitus.
