Abstract

25

The global COVID-19 pandemic produced large-scale health and economic complications. Older

26

people and those with comorbidities are particularly vulnerable to this virus, with nursing homes and

27

long term care facilities experiencing significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19

28

outbreaks. The aim of this rapid systematic review was to investigate measures implemented in long

29

term care facilities to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and their effect on morbidity and mortality of

30

residents, staff, and visitors. Databases (including MedRXiv pre-published repository) were

31

systematically searched to identify studies reporting assessment of interventions to reduce

32

transmission of COVID-19 in nursing homes among residents, staff, or visitors. Outcome measures

33

include facility characteristics, morbidity data, case fatalities, and transmission rates. Due to study

34

quality and heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was conducted. The search yielded 1414 articles, with 38

35

studies included. Reported interventions include mass testing, use of personal protective equipment,

36

symptom screening, visitor restrictions, hand hygiene and droplet/contact precautions, and resident

37

cohorting. Prevalence rates ranged from 1.2-85.4% in residents and 0.6-62.6% in staff. Mortality rates

38

ranged from 5.3-55.3% in residents. Novel evidence in this review details the impact of facility size,

39

availability of staff and practices of operating between multiple facilities, and for-profit status of

40

facilities as factors contributing to the size and number of COVID-19 outbreaks. No causative

41

relationships can be determined; however, this review provides evidence of interventions that reduce

42

transmission of COVID-19 in long term care facilities.

Introduction

50

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first identified in

51

China in 2019, resulting in the current global pandemic in 2020.1 The ensuing disease associated with

52

infection from SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, has produced large-scale public health and

53

worldwide economic effects.2

54

The virus spreads between people through close contact and droplet transmission (coughs and

55

sneezes). While most infected people will experience mild flu like symptoms, others may become

56

seriously ill and die.3 At-risk groups include older people and those with underlying medical

57

conditions, while men appear to have more susceptibility than women. Symptom severity varies;

58

several individuals remain asymptomatic, others experience fever, cough, sore throat, general

59

weakness, and fatigue, while more severe respiratory illnesses and infections may result, which can be

60

fatal.4,5 Deterioration in clinical presentations can occur rapidly, leading to poorer health outcomes.

61

Anosmia and ageusia are reported in evidence from South Korea, China, and Italy in patients with

62

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in some cases in the absence of other symptoms.6

63

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak constituted a Public Health

64

Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.5 Two primary goals of action

65

were 1) to accelerate innovative research to help contain the spread and facilitate care for all affected,

66

and 2) to support research priorities globally the learning from the pandemic response for

67

preparedness. Globally, up to October 5, 2020, there are 35 247 104 cases of COVID-19 (following

68

the applied case definitions and testing strategies in the affected countries) including 1 038 069

69

deaths.7 Within Europe, over 5 431 510 cases are reported, with 226 869 deaths7

70

Presently there is no vaccine; therefore, preventing and limiting transmission is advocated.

71

International and national evidence mandates physical distancing, regular hand hygiene and cough

72

etiquette, and limiting touching eyes, nose or mouth; in addition to regular cleaning of surfaces.8

73

As noted older people are an at-risk group for COVID-19, and throughout the pandemic, the impact

74

on this population has resulted in increased mortality, specifically those living in long term care

facilities (LTCF) where a high proportion of outbreaks with increased rates of morbidity and case

76

fatality in residents are recorded.9 In several EU/EEA countries, LTCF deaths among residents,

77

associated with COVID-19, account for 37% to 66% of all COVID-19-related fatalities.9 The specific

78

rationale for their increased susceptibility is less clear. The United Nations (UN) (2020) acknowledge

79

that COVID-19 exposes the inequalities in society and the failures expressed in the 2030 Agenda for

80

Sustainable Development. The UN report the disproportionate fatality rates in those aged over 80

81

years as five times the global average10 and suggest a need for a more inclusive, equitable and age-

82

friendly society, anchored in human rights (p.16).11

83

The aim of this rapid review of the literature was to assess the extent to which measures implemented

84

in LTCF reduced transmission of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) among residents, staff, and visitors, and

85

the effect of these measures on morbidity and mortality outcomes.

86

Methods

87

The protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020191569)12 and reporting follows PRISMA

88

guidelines.13

Search strategy

90

Search strategies comprised search terms both for keywords and controlled-vocabulary search terms

91

MESH and EMTREE (see Supplementary Table 1 for full search terms). EMBASE (via OVID),

92

PubMed (via OVID), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL),

93

Cochrane Database and Repository, and MedRXiv pre-published databases were searched. No time

94

limits were imposed, and databases were searched up to July 27, 2020. Reference lists of included

95

evidence were checked for further articles.

96

Eligibility criteria

97

All study designs (experimental, observational, and qualitative) are included, and no exclusions

98

placed on language. Included studies report an assessment of measures to reduce transmission of

99

COVID-19 (including SARS or MERS) in residents, employees, or visitors of LTCF. To provide as

100

comprehensive a review of the evidence we included any intervention implemented to reduce the

transmission of COVID-19 in long-term residential care facilities, including facility measures, social

102

distancing, use of personal protective equipment, and hand hygiene.

103

Primary outcome measures

104

Primary outcome measures are morbidity data, case fatality rates, reductions in reported transmission

105

rates, and facility characteristics associated with COVID-19 incidence.

106

Selection of studies and data extraction

107

Two authors developed search strings (DS & KF); all database searches were completed by one

108

author (DS) (Supplementary Table 1). Following de-duplication, references were uploaded into

109

Covidence management platform (LM), and two authors independently screened all titles and

110

abstracts (LM & KF). Full texts of all potentially eligible studies were independently reviewed by two

111

authors (LM & KF). Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third author (CK). Data from

112

included studies were independently extracted in duplicate (LM & KF). A data extraction form was

113

developed and modified from documents used previously by authors (KF & CK). Extracted data

114

included study characteristics (title, lead author, year of publication, country, study setting, study

115

design), description of the intervention, number and characteristics of participants, outcomes, duration

116

of follow-up, sources of funding, peer review status). Study design (required for review of quality)

117

was independently assessed by two authors (LM & KF), with disagreements resolved by a third

118

author (CK).

119

Assessment of Quality

120

Two review authors (LM & EL) independently assessed the quality of included studies using Mixed

121

Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT),14 with disagreements resolved by a third author (KF) and

122

discussed with the lead author (CK) (Supplementary Table 2). The MMAT is used widely and

123

considered a valid indicator of methodological quality using instruments for non-randomised and

124

descriptive studies.

Results

132

We identified 1414 articles, and 131 full-text articles were selected for review. After an evaluation

133

against our inclusion criteria, 38 studies (40 papers) are included in this systematic review (Figure 1).

134

Infection control measures

139

Twenty studies report the nature of LTCFs related with outbreaks and transmission of COVID-19

140

infection (Table 2; 16,23,28,29,31,33,35-39,41-43,45-47,50-52). Thirty studies (Table 3a; 17-29,32-34,37-43,45-50,53) report

141

evidence of measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in long-term residential care facilities for

142

residents, 25 studies (Table 3b; 17-22,24,26-30,32,34,38,39,42-48,50,53) report evidence for employee outcomes,

143

and two studies report evidence for visitors (Table 3c; 28,47).

144

A variety of infection control measures are described (Tables 1 and 3a-c) including: mass

145

testing/point-prevalence testing (22 studies; 17,19-22,25-30,32-34,38,39,44,45,48-50,53), use of personal protective

146

equipment (10 studies; 17,18,20,25,28,29,32,45,47,49), screening of residents, staff, or visitors for symptoms (8

147

studies; 18-20,23,25,27,29,32), restrictions on visitor entry (10 studies; 18-20,25,27,29,32,45,49,53), hand hygiene and

148

contact and droplet precautions (6 studies; 19,23,25,32,45,46), and cohorting/isolation of residents (11

149

studies; 19,20,22,25,28,29,32,33,45,47,49). Thirteen studies examined characteristics of LTCF and their

150

association with COVID-19 infection and risk 16,24,31,35-37,39-43,51,52.

Medicaid dependency, ownership, five-star rating, and prior infection violation were not significantly related to COVID-19 cases.
Risk of infection:
Facility employee numbers (relative to <10 workers): 11-20 non-care workers HR = 6.502 (95%CI 2.614 -16.17); 21-30 non-care
workers HR = 9.870 (95% CI 3.224 -30.22); >30 non-care workers HR = 18.927 (95% CI 2.358 -151.90).
Predictors of spread and increase in cases per unit after 5th April risk increased 1.0347 (95% CI 1.02-1.05) p < 0.001, reduced
availability of PPE for eye protection increased risk 1.6571 (95% CI 1.29-2.13) p < 0.001, PPE for facemasks 1.2602 (95% CI
1.09-1.46) p = 0.002, count of care workers employed 1.0379 (95% CI 1.02-1.05) p < 0.001 count of nurses employed (in bands of
0-10,11-20, 21-30 and 31+) 1.1814 (95% CI 1.13-1.24) p < 0.001.
Incidence in high crowding index homes was 9.7% versus 4.5% in low crowding index homes (p<0.001), while COVID-19
mortality was 2.7% versus 1.3%. Likelihood of COVID-19 introduction did not differ (31.3% vs 30.2%, p=0.79). After adjustment
for a regional nursing home, and resident covariates, the crowding index remained associated with increased risk of infection
(RR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.11-2.65) and mortality (RR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.03-2.86). Simulations suggested that converting all 4-bed rooms
to 2-bed rooms would have averted 988 (18.9%) infections of COVID-19 and 271 (18.7%) deaths.
Significant associations between the presence of an outbreak and number of beds (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50), a history of
multiple previous outbreaks (OR 3.76), and regulatory risk assessment score (OR high-risk vs low 2.19). However, in the adjusted
analysis, only number of beds (OR per 20-bed increase 3.50, 95%CI 2.06 to 5.94 per 20-bed increase).
COVID-19 outbreak recorded in 121 of 179 facilities (67.6%). Large LTCF had greater rates of infection (aHR=1.8 [95% CI: 1.42.4] for LTCF with ≥70 beds versus <35 beds. The adjusted hazard ratio for confirmed infection was 2.5 times [95% CI: 1.9-3.3]
greater in LTCF with 0·85-1 resident per room versus LTCF with 0.7-0.85 resident per room. A ten-percentage point increase in the
bed to staff ratio was associated with a 23% increase in infection (aHR=1·23 [95% CI: 1.17-1.31]).
Covid-19 cases higher in for-profit operators 165/361 (45.7%) compared to charitable 18/57 (31.6%).
Residents noted to share rooms, walk throughout the facility and spent time in shared areas (e.g., gym, dining rooms, and
recreational rooms). Because all case-patients had visited the gym at the facility for recreation or physical therapy before becoming
ill, environmental cleaning of this area was performed.

67 of 90 residents participated. 26 of 32 staff participated. 2 residents and one staff member were positive during the outbreak. None
of the remaining participants was positive for SARS-CoV antibodies. Residents were aged 65+ years, 79% were female, 93% were
ambulant, 90% did activities with others, 79% went out.
Review of residents who died: Resident A transferred from the hospital and was chair bound and dependent with care needs.
Resident B was chair bound and had not left home or had visitors. She was brought to a shared sitting room during mealtimes. This
was only time residents A and B were located near each other. One resident shared a room with patient B and tested positive.
Staff C was a domestic worker, and contact was via clinical waste in resident A room.
Low seroprevalence attributed to precautionary measures taken in the facility to reduce droplet and prevent contact transmission.
Risks noted of SARS via fomites possible.
3 residents positive for SARS. 1 employee positive for SARS. 3 visitors positive for SARS. The index case was a single resident
who was infected during a hospital stay, returned to the LTCF, and the virus spread to another 6 people. Transmission of the virus
occurred due to lack of isolation rooms in nursing homes, lack of restricted movement of other patients and relatives, lack of
infection control precautions, lack of knowledge among staff.
Larger cluster sizes in long term care hospitals/facilities were significantly positively associated with higher morbidity (ρ = 0.336, P
= 0.006) and higher mortality (ρ = 0.317, P = 0.009).
Multivariate logistic regression showed larger cluster size (OR = 1.077, 95% CI: 1.017-1.145) and larger cluster number (OR =
2.019, 95% CI: 1.197-3.404) associated with mortality.
Outbreak recorded in 75.0% (21/28) of facilities – four public and seventeen private. During the study period, 40.1% of residents in
21 nursing homes with outbreaks had a laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. Correlation between the proportion of symptomatic staff
and number of residents with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (ρ=0.81). No significant correlation between the proportion of
asymptomatic staff and number of residents with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (ρ=0.18 p=0.61).
After the management of the outbreak, there were no more infected persons. All patients and employees tested negative 14 days
from the start of quarantine.
February 28, 2020, four cases COVID-19 identified in County. One person identified as index case from Facility A. Staff roles for
confirmed cases reported: therapists, nurses, nurse assistants, health information manager, physician, and case manager. Paper
reports that 30 facilities in County had confirmed cases and provides detail on first 9 (Facilities A to I).
Facility A shared staff with another facility and two resident transfers from facility A. Surveillance reported inadequate PPE,
training, infection control practices, lack of documentation signs and symptoms, working in unfamiliar facilities or sharing staff.
On March 10, 2020, the governor of Washington implemented mandatory screening of health care workers and visitor restrictions
for all licensed nursing homes and assisted living facilities including screening, testing, policies around visiting, excluding
symptomatic staff, close monitoring of residents, testing, training and PPE. Monitoring of staff absences.
For each additional member of infected staff working at the care home, the odds of resident infection increase by 11%, i.e. OR =
1.11 (95% CI: 1.1-1.11). Care homes using bank or agency nurses or carers most or every day more likely to have cases in residents
(OR= 1.58, 95% CI: 1.5 - 1.65) compared to those who never use bank or agency staff. Residents in care homes outside of London
had a lower chance of infection, except West Midlands (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.0 - 1.17). Homes where staff receive sick pay are less
likely to have resident cases (OR= 0.82 to 0.93, 95% CI: 7-18%), compared to homes where no sick leave. For each additional
infected resident at a home, the odds of staff infection increase by 4% OR=1.04 (95% CI: 4 - 4%). Care homes using bank or agency
staff most or every day OR=1.88 (95% CI: 1.77-2.0) compared to homes not using. Homes where staff regularly work elsewhere
(most or every day) increase odds (OR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.92 - 3.0) compared to homes who never work elsewhere. Staff at homes

Morbidity and mortality
Morbidity and mortality results from included studies are presented for residents (Table 3a), staff
(Table 3b), and visitors (Table 3c). Prevalence of COVID-19 infection was reported in 29 studies,
including prevalence in residents (27 studies; 17-29,32-34,38,39,41,43,45-50,53) and staff (22 studies; 17,19-22,24,2630,32,34,38,39,44-48,50,53

), with 2 studies reporting absolute case numbers in visitors.28,47 Prevalence rates

ranged from 3.8% in a sample of 2074 LTCF48 and 1.2% in the third point-prevalence survey at a
single facility20 to 85.4% in a single facility that implemented a telemedicine service to limit
transmission.24 Staff prevalence ranged from 0.6% in a point-prevalence survey in a single facility20 to
62.6% in a group of nine LTCF.21 One study reported 16 COVID-19 positive visitor cases,28 while a
study which examined SARS infection following an outbreak in a Hong Kong facility reported 3
positive visitor cases.47
The symptom status (symptomatic/presymptomatic/asymptomatic, typical/atypical symptoms) of
participants was reported in 16 studies, with resident and staff symptom status reported in 15 1719,21,22,25-27,29,32,33,45,48,50,53

and 13 studies,19-22,26,27,29,32,44,45,48,50,53 respectively. No studies reported

symptom status of visitors. The proportion of COVID-19 positive residents presenting with symptoms
ranged from 26.3%19,26 to 59.8% (a sample of both residents and healthcare workers).27 Asymptomatic
cases in residents were reported in 13 studies,17,19,21,22,25-27,29,32,45,48,50,53 with proportions of COVID-19
positive residents presenting with no symptoms varying from 2.4%45 to 75.3%.48 Among COVID-19
positive staff, the proportion of symptomatic cases ranged from 6.4%26 to 100%,32 and asymptomatic
cases ranged from 23.6%50 to 100%.20,22
Mortality results were reported in 22 studies, including information on mortality of residents (22
studies; 17-19,22-24,27-29,33,34,37-43,45,47,49,50), staff (4 studies; 28,34,45,47), and visitors (2 studies; 28,47). Mortality
rates in COVID-19 positive residents ranged from 5.3%19 to 55.3%.38 One study reported a 66.7%
death rate in residents who tested positive for the SARS virus.47 A study examining the mortality risk
in Ontario LTCF reported a death rate of 0.1% across all residents.42 Across the three studies which
presented mortality results in COVID-19 positive staff, mortality rates were 0%.28,34,45 One study
presenting mortality rates in a nursing home following a SARS outbreak reported one death of a

respectively.
Characteristics of LTCFs on COVID-19 transmission
Numerous facility-specific characteristics were linked with risk of COVID-19 cases (Table 2). These
include size of LTCF;16,37,38,51 staffing levels and/or use of agency care staff;28,31,36,38,39,43,50 part of
larger chain of organisations and/or for profit status;16,31,35,42,43,50 and related staffing, crowding, or
availability of single rooms.23,29,39,41,43,45-47

Quality review
The quality ratings of included studies are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Overall quality of
evidence in this review is considered low based on MMAT assessment criteria.
Discussion
Evidence in this review indicates the impact of COVID-19 on LTCF, demonstrating the vulnerability
of this setting. A novel outcome highlights the characteristics of LTCF associated with COVID-19
outbreaks, in addition to reporting the prevalence rates of COVID-19 and associated mortality and
morbidity for residents, staff, and visitors. A variety of measures were implemented in LTCF, of
which many were instigated locally by facility managers, and others through agile public health
policy. Mass testing of residents with or without staff testing was the primary measure used to reduce
transmission of COVID-19. This provides objective evidence of infection rates in facilities, and
enables application of subsequent measures, including isolation of residents who are infected with redesignation of specific staff to care for them. Repeated point-prevalence testing allows facilities to
grasp the spread of the virus along with the impact of their mitigation strategies.
Further measures implemented in facilities echoed public health recommendations to the broader
community to limit the spread of the virus. These included guidance on hand hygiene, and contact and
droplet precautions. Restricting visitor access to facilities was implemented generally to reduce the
likelihood of introducing COVID-19 into LTCF, with assessment of body temperature and symptom
screening of staff and visitors on entry.
The prevalence of COVID-19 infection varied throughout included studies, with no distinct pattern
emerging between prevention strategies and infection prevalence. Similarly, the mortality rate varied
widely among studies and prevention measures. However, patterns emerged regarding associations
between facility characteristics and the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak and spread.
The facility size/number of beds was significantly associated with the probability of having a COVID19 case, and the resulting size of an outbreak. For example, in a sample of 30 US nursing homes, the
probability of having a COVID -19 case was increased in medium and large facilities compared with

small facilities,16 while in 121 UK homes reporting an outbreak, facilities with ≥70 beds had 80%
greater infection rates than facilities with <35 beds.38 A sample of 623 Canadian nursing homes
demonstrated facilities with a high crowding index had more infections and deaths than those with a
low crowding index. Simulations conducted suggested nearly 20% of infections and deaths may have
been averted by converting all 4-bed rooms into 2-bed rooms.41 Similarly, facilities with a greater
number of staff, staff who work in multiple facilities, and greater number of infected staff, were also
more likely to experience a COVID -19 outbreak.36,39,50 However, facilities where staff receive sick
leave were shown to be less likely to have positive cases.39 Reduced availability of PPE predicted the
spread and increase in case number in facilities,36 while for-profit status of facilities was commonly
identified as increasing the odds of case outbreaks relative to non-profit status.16,31,35,42,43
Quality review
The quality of evidence in this review is technically low, primarily reported from observational
studies, expert opinion, reporting of outbreaks and describing the process and management
(Supplementary Table 2). Factors associated with lower quality of evidence includes the reliance of
self-reporting of symptoms, recall bias, use of datasets which may be incomplete, and use of
convenience sampling. However, confirmation of COVID-19 in the majority of studies was via
laboratory testing. We did not remove any study following our review of quality and the evidence is
consistent with real time reporting of data to learn from outbreaks. The Institute of Medicine (2004)54
advocates for early detection of epidemics, effective communication to the public, and promotion of
research and development for strategic planning.
Limitations in the review process
A key strength of this review is that it addresses a knowledge gap and has collated evidence from a
broad methodological base to report the measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in LTFC and
reports characteristics of facilities.
Due to the heterogeneity of studies, meta-analysis was not performed, while the descriptive nature of
studies prevents identification of a causative relationship between measures and outcomes. Despite

this, the systematic approach to this review has identified the scope of interventions implemented in
LTFC to reduce COVID -19 transmission.
Publication bias was minimized with inclusion of pre-published evidence, follow up contacts with
authors for early reporting, and through the inclusion of observational study designs. Most studies
reported are in English, we translated papers from German and Spanish as part of the assessment and
review. Outbreak reports include convenience samples or smaller cohorts of residents in LTCF with
limited data reported in brief reports and letters. However, real time reporting of outbreaks provides
immediate evidence and shared understanding advocated by the Institute of Medicine.54
While the present review builds on a review by Salcher-Konrad, Jhass, Naci, Tan, El-Tawil, ComasHerrera 55, a recent report from WHO,56 and from an Irish review report,57 data on the role of facilities
in the transmission of COVID-19 are reported.
Conclusion
This novel, rapid review summarises the evidence base to date identifying specific factors for
consideration as part of preparedness plans to reduce transmission of COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCF.
Future research should incorporate methodologically robust study designs with longer follow up to
assess the impact on reducing transmission.
