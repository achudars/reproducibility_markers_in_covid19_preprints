Abstract – 98 words
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship has caused
over 634 cases as of February 20, 2020. We model the transmission process on the ship with a
stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4). We estimate a
large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go
extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), and thus timely actions were
crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.
Keywords: coronavirus disease 2019; reproduction number; dispersion; superspreading; serial

Backgrounds
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019, and spread to over 40
foreign countries in a short period of time [1-3]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 [4]. To date,
there are over 70000 COVID-19 confirmed cases in China, and over 2000 cases outside China. The
COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess, a British cruise ship that contains 3711 tourists and
crew members, caused 634 confirmed cases as of February 20, 2020 and became the largest outbreak
outside China [5].
In this study, we model the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess ship, estimate the key
epidemiological parameters of this outbreak and explore the effects of several different control
measures.

Methods
We consider the population on the Diamond Princess ship as a close cohort with N = 3711
individuals. Following [6], we simulate the transmission process stochastically. For a given COVID19 case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the number of secondary cases follows a negative
binomial (NB) distribution with a mean at Reff(t) and a dispersion parameter at k [7]. The Reff(t) is the
effective reproduction number, and Reff(t) = R0[N – C(t)]/N, where C(t) is the cumulative number of
cases at the t-th day and R0 is the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 to be estimated. The time
delay between symptom onset dates of a primary case and any of its associated secondary cases is
the serial interval (SI). Hence, for a given primary case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the
symptom onset time of each associated secondary case is expected to be the summation of t and SI of
COVID-19. It is conventional to assume the SI to follow a Gamma distribution with mean at 4.5
days and standard deviation (SD) at 3.1 days [8, 9].
We collect the confirmed cases time series released in the situation reports of COVID-19 infections
in Japan [5]. We simulate the courses of the COVID-19 outbreaks stochastically starting from one
infectious index case on January 20, 2020. We calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of R0 and
k by fitting model to the number of confirmed cases with Poisson-distributed likelihood framework.
The 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of R0 and k are calculated by using the profile likelihood
estimation framework with a cutoff threshold determined using a Chi-square quantile [10].
We repeat the fitting and estimation procedures above under an alternative scenario with mean SI at
7.5 days and SD at 3.4 days, which was estimated in [2]. We evaluate the modelling performance

with mean SI at 4.5 or 7.5 days by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Under the later scenario
with mean SI at 7.5 days, we find that the R0 is larger than 5 which is not in line with WHO estimates
and hard to justify in a ‘quarantine’ setting. In particular, the later scenario yields a higher AIC by 10
units than the former scenario with mean SI at 4.5 days. Thus, we argue the former scenario is most
likely the reality, and consider it as the main results.
Furthermore, we consider four ‘what-if’ scenarios and they were
•

scenario (0): the best-fit model, i.e., baseline scenario;

•

scenario (1): 1000 susceptibles were removed on February 11, 2020;

•

scenario (2): the R0 was reduced to 1.5; and

•

scenario (3): combining scenarios (1) and (2).

We simulate the model under four different scenarios and estimate the key epidemiological
parameters. We estimate the cumulative number of cases on February 20, the outbreak final size, the
epidemic doubling time and the peaking time to capture the patterns of outbreak.

Results
With a mean SI at 4.5 days, we estimate the R0 to be 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4), which is consistent with
previous estimates [7, 8, 11]. The fitting results are shown in Fig 1(a) and (b), which match the
observed data well. We estimate the dispersion term (k) to be 44 (95%CI: 6−88), which is
significantly larger than 1 and consistent with [7]. The simulation results with or without dispersion
term (k) were largely consistent, which implies the virus is hard to go extinction that other two
coronavirus. Note that low k implies high chance of superspreading events and high chance of
extinction.
Without control measures, we estimate that the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to cause 3066 cases
(95%CI: 2046−3441) on the ship, and the epidemic curve is likely to peak around February 28, 2020
with a doubling time at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), see Fig 1(b) and Table 1. Under scenario (1),
timely reduction in the susceptible population could lower the final size and sustainably reduce the
daily incidences. Under scenario (2), the lower the R0, decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, the lower the final
size and the later the peaking time will be. If the susceptible pools and R0 are reduced
simultaneously, the COVID-19 outbreak on the ship will be likely mitigated and postponed largely,
see Fig 1(d).

Discussion
The R0 of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship is likely to be lower than that of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) which ranges from 2.2 to 3.6 [12]. The k quantifies the chance of the
superspreading events and the extinction of the disease. We obtained a large k which implies that
COVID-19 is much easier to persist than other coronavirus with a small k [6, 7, 13,14]. On the other
hand, our finding highlights the different characteristics between COVID-19 (less superspreading)
and SARS (more superspreading), which should be taken into consideration into mitigation. As such,
the self-protection actions including wearing facemasks, reducing outdoor activities or gathering and
maintain hygiene and sterilized, were thus recommended.
The situation on the Diamond Princess cruise implies that the virus could spread rapidly, most likely
with a short SI than previously estimated [2]. Note that a recent study on the 1099 patients found that
the median of incubation period is only 3 days, thus a short effective SI is also possible [15]. With a
shorter SI, a relatively lower R0 could also result in a rapid growth of the epidemic size [16], and
with a shorter epidemic doubling time as we show in Table 1. Therefore, timely contact tracing and
effectively quarantine were crucial to shutoff the transmission.
The simulation results under scenarios (1)-(3) indicate that the public health control measures could
effectively mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak on the ship in terms of the final size, see Table 1.
Decreasing the disease transmissibility in terms of R0 could postpone the peak, which may gain
valuable time to prepare and allocate the resources in response to incoming patients. Relocating the
population at risk (if possible) could sustainably decrease the daily incidences, and thus relieve the
tensive demands in the healthcare, and improve in the treatment outcome.
We suggest maintaining the enhancement in both populational level public health control as well as
the individual level self-protection actions in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. With detailed
information on public intervention, the analytical framework in this study can be extended to a
complex context and used for evaluating the effects of certain control measures.
From Japan official reports (https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_09542.html), we obtain the
following

2/15/2020 Positive cases were confirmed in 285 of the 930 people tested (including 73 asymptomatic
pathogen carriers).
2/20/2020 A total of 634 people (including 328 asymptomatic pathogen carriers) tested positive for a
total of 3,063 people.
From the above official announcement of Japan, the cumulative ratio of asymptomatic cases out of
all confirmations went up from 25.6% to 51.7% between Feb 15 and Feb 20, 2020. It is hard to
believe that such a large amount of asymptomatic cases were infected before the quarantine start date
(Feb 5, 2020) and missed in Feb 15 test. The number of tests are much larger than the number of
positive results, and this implies high effort of testing and relatively reliable data. It is reasonable to
argue that the quarantine is not so successful to prevent the emergence of asymptomatic cases, but
successfully slowed down the occurrence of symptomatic cases, as suggested by studies based on
cases onset date data. In the other words, quarantine measure likely changed the way how the virus
transmitted, thus the level of symptoms of cases. Presumably, in these studies of onset date data only,
asymptomatic confirmations are not counted as cases. In this study, we use laboratory confirmations
with updated (shorter) serial interval of COVID-19. The lesson learnt here is certainly useful in
future similar outbreaks of COVID-19.
