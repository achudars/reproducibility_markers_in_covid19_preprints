Abstract
Background:
The remarkable progress seen in maternal and child health (MCH) in India over the past two
decades has been impacted by setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to undertake
a rapid assessment to identify key priorities for public health research in MCH in India within
the context and aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods:
A web-based survey was developed to identify top research priorities in MCH. It consisted of 26
questions on six broad domains: vaccine preventable diseases, outbreak preparedness, primary
healthcare

integration,

maternal

health,

neonatal

health,

and

infectious

diseases.

Key

stakeholders were invited to participate between September and November 2020. Participants
assigned importance on a 5-point Likert scale, and assigned overall ranks to each sub-domain
research priority. Descriptive statistics were used to examine Likert scale responses, and a
ranking analysis was done to obtain an “average ranking score” and identify the top research
priority under each domain.

Results:
Amongst the 84 respondents, 37% were public-health researchers, 25% healthcare providers,
20% academic faculty and 13% were policy makers. Across the six domains, most respondents
considered conducting research on systems strengthening as extremely important. The highest
ranked research priorities were strengthening the public sector workforce (vaccine preventable
diseases), enhancing public-health

Conclusions:
The overall focus for research priorities in MCH in India during the COVID-19 pandemic is on

Background
Maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes have been key public health issues in developing
countries including India. While the past 25 years have witnessed a concerted global effort to
improve MCH in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), more progress is needed to meet
the targets laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In India, key MCH indicators
remain concerning, as evidenced by partially released results from the National Family Health
Survey-5 (NFHS-5), which indicate worsening of maternal and child nutrition indicators in
several states (1). There is an urgent need to identify targeted approaches to improve the state
of MCH in India.

While MCH programs in India are weighed down by wide inequities (1, 2), these challenges
have been amplified by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct effects of the
disease, the indirect effects of the pandemic have been devastating. Limitations in the
availability of skilled health workers and health system access barriers have led to lower
coverage of antenatal and postnatal care services, and routine childhood immunization
services, especially in rural India (3, 4). A recent modelling paper estimated that the disruption
and decreased utilization of routine health services and reduced access to food during the
pandemic could lead to an estimated 9.8–44.7% increase in under-5 child deaths per month,
and an 8.3–38.6% increase in maternal deaths per month in LMIC settings (5).

Health research has been noted to be an essential tool for improving health outcomes in LMICs
(6). Research prioritization during the COVID-19 pandemic using a methodical and inclusive
process could guide researchers, policy makers and funding agencies in making informed
decisions and improving outcomes. We aimed to undertake a rapid assessment to identify key
priorities for public health research in MCH in India within the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, by surveying key stakeholders and experts in India.

Methods
Survey questionnaire and design: A survey to assess research needs in MCH was developed by
researchers at the Johns Hopkins Maternal and Child Health Center in India and key Indian
institutions. Specific priority research domains were identified through a review of previous
survey results (2), and literature on global priorities in maternal newborn and child health. The
survey consisted of 26 questions which focused on the following six broad domains: vaccine
preventable diseases, outbreak preparedness, primary healthcare integration, maternal health,
neonatal health, and infectious diseases. Under each domain, participants were requested to
assign importance to each sub-domain research priority on a 5-point Likert scale, and assign
overall ranks to each sub-domain research priority. Open-ended questions were also included

to capture other aspects of research priorities. In each domain, participants had the option to
nominate a different research topic not included in the prepared list; these could be ranked by
importance in the same manner. The study was reviewed by the JHSPH Institutional Review
Board (IRB) and determined to be exempt from human subjects research oversight.

Participants: Key stakeholders working in the field of MCH in India were identified through desk
reviews, web-based searches, dissemination in professional networks such as the Indian
Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, Indian Public Health Association, Indian
Academy of Pediatrics and the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India,
and through collaborators.

Dissemination of the survey: The survey was administered online using the software platform
Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) between September and November 2020. It was disseminated
via email, text messages and social media platforms such as WhatsApp. No personal data were
collected, although respondents could choose to share their contact information for future
surveys.

Data analysis: Descriptive statistics, expressed as frequencies and proportions, were used to
examine respondent demographics and Likert scale responses. The Likert scale for each subdomain research priority was analyzed by tabulating responses based on importance level
ascribed. A ranking analysis was conducted using weights that were inversely related to the raw
rank from the survey, to obtain an “average ranking score”, which helped identify the top
research priorities in each research domain (7). Responses to the open-ended items were
assessed by two authors (SLP and KM). Comments were read independently, and summarized
following discussion according to the principles of thematic analysis.

Results
Participant characteristics
The online survey was completed by 84 respondents from 15 states in India. Male respondents
constituted 58%, and professional backgrounds were distributed as follows: public health
researchers (37%), healthcare providers (25%), academic teaching faculty (20%) and policy
makers (13%). An almost equal number of the respondents belonged to non-governmental
organizations/private organizations or governmental organizations, and over 65% had work
experience of over 10 years in their primary area of expertise. The most common primary areas
of work included child health (20%), infectious diseases (17%), health systems and policy (14%),
biostatistics and epidemiology (14%), and maternal health (8%) (Table 1).

Importance of research topics on the Likert scale
Across the six domains identified in the survey, most respondents characterised conducting
research on systems strengthening priorities as extremely important (Figure 1). In the vaccine
preventable diseases domain, over 50% of the respondents considered enhancing vaccination
rates among the urban poor, strengthening the public sector workforce and improving
vaccination coverage as extremely important. In the outbreak preparedness domain, the
proportion who considered the sub-domain research priorities as extremely important ranged
from 48% (conducting COVID-19 research for MCH sub-populations) to 76% (enhancing public
health surveillance networks). In the primary care integration domain, over 45% of the
respondents considered all sub-domain research priorities as extremely important, and 63% felt
research on nutrition education support through community health workers was extremely
important. In the maternal health domain, systems strengthening was considered extremely
important, with 64% considering research on improving facility-based safe delivery outcomes as
extremely important. In the neonatal health domain, system strengthening priorities were
similarly deemed extremely important, with over 75% considering improving the quality of care
during labor and birth, and 67% considering measures to reduce birth asphyxia and improve the
initiation of breastfeeding in the hospital as extremely important. In the infectious diseases
domain, 63% and 45% of the respondents considered conducting research on diarrhoeal
diseases and COVID-19 respectively, extremely important.

Overall ranking of research priorities
The highest ranked research priorities identified across domains were strengthening the public
sector workforce (vaccine preventable diseases), enhancing public health surveillance networks
(outbreak preparedness), nutrition support through community workers (primary care
integration), encouraging at least 4-8 antenatal visits during pregnancy (maternal health),
neonatal resuscitation to reduce birth asphyxia (neonatal health), and pediatric and maternal
screening and treatment of tuberculosis (infectious diseases) (Table 2). While the Likert scale
importance assignment and overall ranking exercises were concurrent across most domains, in
the infectious diseases domain, a large proportion of respondents felt research on diarrhoeal
disease prevention and treatment was extremely important; the ranking exercise, however,
yielded pediatric and maternal screening and treatment for tuberculosis as the top priority.

Other research priorities identified
Several additional research topics were also suggested by the respondents across the six
domains. Common themes identified were systems strengthening priorities like enhancing
vaccine programme surveillance, empowering communities and community health workers,
enhancing the quality of antenatal and postnatal care, and health systems strengthening for the
infectious diseases domain. Novel research approaches for COVID-19 related research, and the

use of technology like telemedicine, geographic information systems and artificial intelligence
for the effective delivery of services across domains were also suggested, but these were not
considered to be as important as system strengthening priorities during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.
Discussion

The key theme that emerged from this study seeking to identify MCH public health research
priorities in India within the context of an unprecedented pandemic was the importance of
systems strengthening rather than undertaking novel research. The findings of this exercise
appeared to signal a shift from those of recent priority setting exercises in MCH, both from
India and globally, which were conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wazny et al
employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method for research
priority setting for child health research in India for the period between 2016-2025, with
research ideas crowd-sourced from a network of experts across India (8). The majority of the
top research priorities identified were related to the development of cost-effective
interventions and their implementation, impact evaluations, improving data quality and
monitoring of existing programs, and improving the management of morbidities (8). An Indian
Council of Medical Research study to identify top research priorities in MCH found that the
delivery domain of research which included implementation research, constituted about 70% of
the top ten research options (9). A global exercise to characterize maternal and perinatal health
priorities beyond 2015 identified research priorities that were mostly related to
implementation research and the innovative development of simplified, cost-effective
adaptations of existing interventions (10). These studies also identified areas for novel or
“discovery” research in MCH, such as the development of innovative point of care diagnostics
and technological solutions for acute maternal, neonatal and childhood morbidities, which
were ranked high in priority lists. These studies employed the CHNRI method, which offers a
detailed, systematic algorithm for the identification of research priorities that pools individual
scorings of research options based on five weighted criteria, leveraging the collective wisdom of
various stakeholders (11). This method involves several stages, which could take months to
complete. Our study, positioned to fulfill the need for a rapid assessment during the COVID-19
pandemic found that prioritizing research endeavors in MCH to focus on strengthening existing
service delivery was most important, and this theme was cross-cutting across the six domains.
Epidemics in the past have demonstrated that they are highly disruptive to existing health
systems. Studies conducted during the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014 have shown that
the indirect effects of the pandemic on maternal health were severe, resulting in decreased
utilization of antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care (12). Significant decreases in
coverage for most vaccines were also observed (13). A prospective observational study at a

tertiary hospital in India reported a reduction in institutional deliveries, increase in pregnancies
with complications, and increase in intensive care unit admissions between the months of AprilAugust 2020 (14). Only a third of women had adequate antenatal care visits during this period
(14). Considering the threat posed by the pandemic on previous gains in MCH, focusing
interventions and policies around the identified priority areas would be crucial to steadying the
health outcomes of mothers and children.
An unintended consequence of lockdowns and movement restrictions resulting from the
COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs like India is their influence on ongoing transmissions of other nonCOVID related infectious diseases. India reports the highest burden of tuberculosis globally,
accounting for a quarter of the 10 million global cases and 1.4 million deaths annually (15). A
recent modelling analysis of the impact on COVID-19 related disruptions in tuberculosis services
in India showed that even temporary disruptions could cause long term increases in
tuberculosis incidence and mortality (16). In our study, under the infectious diseases domain,
conducting research on tuberculosis was ranked as the top research priority, highlighting the
fact that tuberculosis continues to remain highly relevant in the Indian setting, despite the
emergence of COVID-19. Further, a majority of respondents also felt that conducting research
on diarrhoeal diseases was extremely important, emphasizing the need to continue to focus
efforts on the prevention and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases in the Indian context. The
overall ranking for diarrhoeal diseases, however, occurred below that of tuberculosis, COVID19, and dengue infections, underscoring the changing patterns of high-burden infectious
diseases in India. The identification of non-COVID-19 infectious diseases as leading research
priorities in the infectious diseases domain in a survey administered during the unprecedented
pandemic highlights the collective opinion of the respondents on the need to sustain research
focus on other non-COVID-19 infectious diseases as well.
While there are useful lessons learned from these findings, the study limitations are worth
noting. The survey was distributed within a short timeline between September - November
2020, and the results are limited by the small sample size and possible selection bias. Since this
was a rapid assessment, we did not use qualitative methods to capture perspectives, and
priorities were identified solely based on overall ranking and Likert scales. Further, the survey
did not explore priorities for chronic and non-communicable diseases which have also
witnessed an escalating burden in India in recent years. Diagnosis and treatment for such
diseases have likely been affected by COVID-19 as well and warrant further research. Despite
these limitations, our study has been able to perceive a shift in research priorities for MCH
towards systems strengthening during this unprecedented pandemic, and can serve as a
valuable resource for donors, researchers and other stakeholders engaged in maternal and
child health in India.

The COVID-19 pandemic and its response has significantly challenged health systems globally. It
has exposed glaring loopholes in health systems, and has demonstrated that countries’
response to pandemics is ultimately dependent on the resilience of their health systems (17).
Countries such as New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and South Korea have been praised for their
handling of the COVID-19 crisis; they were able to do so efficiently by investing heavily in their
public health systems to improve testing, contact tracing and outreach measures early in the
course of the pandemic (18). Several countries from each of the six WHO regions are
demonstrating that investing in stronger health systems is crucial in responding to COVID-19,
delivering the best returns on investment and making health for all a reality (19). In India, the
private sector has remained a major player in healthcare delivery for several decades (20), but
the ongoing pandemic has highlighted the indisputable role of the public health sector. The
public health sector has not only shouldered a vast majority of preventive and outreach
services, but also clinical care, with a substantial proportion of critical COVID-19 cases being
treated by public health sector services (21). States with robust, well-staffed and equipped
public health systems have been more successful in containing the pandemic, and as a result,
public health has reached the forefront of India’s pandemic response and post-pandemic
discourse. India’s recent budget has promised substantial increases in healthcare allocation and
investment on public health infrastructure (22), and these are welcome steps.
In conclusion, the results of this rapid assessment suggest that in order to build a sustainable
future for maternal and child health during and post COVID-19 in India, national authorities
should prioritize investments and develop frameworks to strengthen existing public health
systems. Governmental investments in health research should be measured against defined
benchmarks (23), and central and state governments should invest in building research capacity
by developing a local workforce of well-trained and motivated researchers. Stronger
collaborations between researchers and policymakers will ensure that research is taken outside
the academic institutions and into public health programmes. Further, national research
networks could be established to coordinate research efforts by fostering collaboration and
information exchange between academic institutions, governmental and non-governmental
organizations. Such partnerships could help in optimally tapping the individual sectors’
strengths and contribute to the journey towards achieving the Sustainable Developmental
Goals and Universal Health Coverage for all by 2030. General recommendations for establishing
research priorities in maternal and child health in India are summarized in Figure 2. While our
results highlight pivotal steps to the roadmap for sustaining and advancing maternal and child
health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian setting, these learnings are
relevant to other emerging global economies as well.
