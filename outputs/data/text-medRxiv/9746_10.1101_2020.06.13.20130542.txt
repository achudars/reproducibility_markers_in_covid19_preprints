Abstract Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) are currently the only mechanism
governments can use to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Similarly to the actual
spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of
NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a speciﬁc region as well as
other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical
conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions
between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics
of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours
along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore,
yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions
at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment
with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied
NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing,
mask wearing and a distinctive “zonal” enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be
applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We ﬁnd that the model is able to
capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy
yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with
individual NPIs. The model and tool are open to extensions to account for omitted or newer
factors affecting the planning and design of NPIs intended to counter the late stages or
forthcoming waves of the COVID-19 crisis.

Introduction
In view of the absence of approved drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 (up to this day), Non-Pharmaceutical
Interventions (NPI) are the mechanisms that public health oﬃces around the world are using in an
attempt to mitigate the impact of its epidemic (Lai et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020). Similarly
to the actual spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns obtained as a result
of application of NPIs are complex and may depend not only on interactions (contacts) between
people according to their individual behaviour, but many other stochastic factors associated to
demographic, geographic, political and economical conditions.
One way of getting insights about the progression of the epidemics so as to allow researchers
and policy-makers to take actions to control its spread, are simulation models. In this respect, there
are two main approaches. The best-known approach uses macroscopic models that represent
population level dynamics with causality analysis or through transition between discrete events

that affect the state of the system (System Dynamics, Discrete Event Simulation). These sort of
models are intended to describe the average infection dynamics and have been used in the past
to study the spread of inﬂuenza pandemics (Ferguson et al., 2006), and more recently to COVID19 (Ferguson et al., 2020). They are build on the basis of the classical epidemic SIR compartment
model (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) or variations of the same, where the entire population is
split in such compartments and the dynamic of the epidemics is explained by how disease evolves
in each compartment rather than at the individual level. Model parameters such as compartment
transition rates are calibrated with available data, whilst others such as reproduction number or
NPI settings are assumed in order to simulate hypothetical scenarios, see e.g. Fanelli and Piazza
(2020); Wilson et al. (2020); Kantner (2020); Giordano et al. (2020); Ansumali and Prakash (2020);
Ferguson et al. (2020); Lai et al. (2020).
The other approach resorts to microscopic modelling of interactions simulated at the individual
level, also known as microsimulation; here the global phenomena are observed as an emergent
property of collective dynamics. Commonly referred as Individual-Based Models or IBM, this approach assumes an inherent network structure within the population, yielding contagions dependent on the interaction (or links) between individuals, whereas onset of symptoms and disease
progress are modelled with probability distributions conditioned on age structures. A number
of models of this kind have been also proposed recently to study the spread and contention of
COVID-19 (Bock et al., 2020; Tuomisto et al., 2020; Gomez et al., 2020).
The latter microsimulation approach is also known as Agent-based Modelling or ABM (Railsback
and Grimm, 2019). Some advantages of the ABM approach to study the epidemic include their ability to model deterministic and non-deterministic decisions made by the individuals affected by
interactions with other agents within a spatial vicinity, enabling a more intuitive and closely resembling the real system being simulated. In this way, uncertainty or variance arises inherently in a
ABM, enabling the model to obtain non-deterministic emergencies without input parameter variation (Ahmed et al., 2012). The randomness of the spatial patterns followed by the free movement
of agents, allows a broader representation of epidemiological relevant heterogeneity in the population. In addition, the ability to deﬁne particular individual traits, as well as behaviour and disease
progression per individual, are useful features to study how non-deterministic effects emerge from
the application of a diverse combination of NPIs.
In this paper we propose an ABM model of the COVID-19 epidemic, incorporating a number of
NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing,
mask protection and a distinctive “zonal” restriction where these interventions can be applied to
separated districts or zones of a hypothetical city. The effect of these strategies are measured in
terms of morbidity, mortality, lethality -infection fatality rate (IFR) and case fatality rate (CFR)-, doubling time, reproduction number and plots of infection, recovery and deaths occurring during the
simulation timeline. The main purpose of the tool is to let modellers see which NPIs or combination of NPIs can help ﬂattening the curve of spread (mitigate) of the disease, in addition to assess
the emergencies in the corresponding epidemics indicators. The details of the contemplated NPIs,
model features and the developed tool are given in the following sections, along with the results
of several simulation scenarios.

NPIs are health policies intended to mitigate the effects of the spread of a new virus when vaccines or medicines are not yet available. They consist of actions recommended to the public or in
some cases, enforced by the government, that affect their daily life habits. During the COVID-19
pandemic, many of these action plans have been designed and deployed at a global scale. Here
we describe those that are currently incorporated into our model.

Social Distancing
This intervention consists of maintaining a minimum physical distance between people so as to
reduce the number of close interactions between infected and healthy individuals, slowing down
the speed of transmission and eventual deaths. In the model, this intervention can be set on or
off, and the actual amount of people willing to comply with the intervention can be deﬁned with a
parameter between 0 and 100%.

Case Isolation
This intervention consists of conﬁning in an enclosed facility (home) either positive tested people
or suﬃciently symptomatic patients that self-isolate, until they recover from the disease. In the
model, this intervention can be set on or off.

Home Quarantine
This intervention consists of conﬁnement of relatives or housemates living in the same household
of isolated cases, during their recovery. It is assumed that quarantined healthy people in the household must observe strict safety protocols to avoid contagion from the isolated case. In the model,
this intervention can be set on or off.

Total Lockdown
This intervention enforces a stay-at-home policy due to partial shutdown of economy. Only some
people are authorised to move around to fulﬁl basic needs or to support essential services. In the
model, this intervention can be set on or off with a parameter of percentage of mobility permits
between 5 and 95%.

Sentinel Testing

115

This intervention consists of running health campaigns performing mass testing at random locations in order to detect not isolated or unconﬁrmed cases of either symptomatic or asymptomatic
carriers. Persons whose test result positive are isolated immediately. In the model, this intervention can be set on or off, with an option to deploy the campaigns widely or restricted to zones. The
stock of tests available is a parameter of the model deﬁned as a fraction of the population between
10 and 100%. Once the campaigns run out of tests, it is possible to replenished them with a new
equal supply.

This intervention assumes that the hypothetical city can be divided in different districts (or zones),
and then recommends to restrict movement of residents to their respective zones only. In other
words, it enforces border closures between districts. The other NPIs can be applied localised to
each zone. In addition, the model enables applying a novel NPI consisting of a total lockdown to
the entire city with the option of gradually lifting of the curfew by individual zones. In the model,
this intervention can be set on or off; besides, it features a command to unlock one zone at a time.

Mask Protection
This intervention consists of the use of face masks as personal protective equipment to avoid
spreading, or breathing in, airborne virus particles. In the model, this intervention is currently
simulated as a population habit controlled by a combination of two parameters: carriers (infected
people) wearing masks or not, and susceptibles (healthy people) wearing masks or not. A particular combination will have incidence in the chance of contagion when two people encounter: 3%
if both are wearing masks, 8% if carrier wears masks but susceptible do not, 50% if susceptible
wears masks but carrier do not, and 90% if none wear masks.

We build upon the compartmental SIRE epidemic model (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Extinct),
but we regarded the Infectious compartment as an extended-state (Lano, 2009) consisting of a number of conditions that we believe explain better the dynamics of the infection. These conditions
are the following: Conﬁrmed or not (indicating the patient will remain isolated), Risky or not (meaning predisposition to develop severe or critical disease), Asymptomatic or not (meaning patient is
unaware of being a virus carrier), Severe or not (meaning it requires to be hospitalised to prevent
death), and Deadly or not (indicating the patient requires Intensive Care Unit -ICU- assistance to
prevent death). The schematics of the resulting extended model, that we termed SIRE+CARDS, is
shown in Figure 1. Notice that not all of these conditions are mutually-exclusive, as they represent
incremental stages of the I state, evolving in a manner that is explained below.
Accordingly, we designed three types of agents: a healthy agent associated to the S and R
states (the latter marked with an immunity condition), a sick agent associated to the I extended
state tagged with the CARDS conditions, and a dead agent associated to the E state. In contrast to
population-dynamic simulation, instead of using transition rates between states, our model uses
transition events. A transition event is a set of decision rules evaluated on the conditions of each
state. It is in this sense our proposal differs from other related ABM approaches where these conditions are regarded as additional compartments of modiﬁed SIR models, e.g. SIDHARTE (Giordano
et al., 2020), REINA (Tuomisto et al., 2020) or INFEKTA (Gomez et al., 2020).
Therefore, we consider the following transition events:
• S : I (infection). A healthy individual may become infected (with a probability p-contagion) if
contact with another infectious individual occurs. When transmission happens, the new case
is initially characterised as not conﬁrmed, not tested, not severe, not deadly, not hospitalised
and not ICU-admitted. Besides, a recovery (or illness) period in days is assigned as a random
variate with a Gaussian distribution centered at the avg-duration model parameter.
• I + Conﬁrmed. This condition characterises an agent as a positive case. This may happen in any
of the following moments: when the patient is tested for the virus and the test results positive;
when the agent has not been previously diagnosed as positive at the moment of admission to
hospital, or admission to ICU bed or death; or when the patient feels suﬃciently symptomatic
so as to self-isolate. On the other hand, if the Case Isolation NPI (see above) is lifted after
having been enforced during the course of the simulation, then the conﬁrmed condition of
agents who have not been tested positive, is reversed (i.e those who self-isolated).
The distinction between conﬁrmed and non-conﬁrmed cases is used to identify individuals
that need to stay isolated so as to prevent his capability to spread the virus. Besides, this
distinction is also useful to examine the discrepancy between “oﬃcial” conﬁrmed fatality rates
and the actual case fatality rate (which is computed with the totality of cases, not only the
conﬁrmed ones).
• I + Asymptomatic. This condition characterises an agent as not showing symptoms for the
disease. The condition is activated upon acquiring the infection, with a probability deﬁned as

a model parameter (%-asymptomatic). In the simulation tool, this condition is indicated with
the colour of the agent (yellow for asymptomatic, red for symptomatic).
• I + Risky. This condition characterises an agent as being in a high-risk population group. Currently the model does not consider neither risk stratiﬁcation of co-morbidities nor age structure of the population. Therefore all these risk factors (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or medium to old age) are encompassed in this single condition which is activated upon
acquiring the infection, with a probability deﬁned as a model parameter (%-high risk).
• I + Severity. This condition indicates progression of the disease to a severe state, which in turn
represents a higher threat of death, as it is deﬁned in the I : E transition. This event occurs
according to the following parameters (see Tuomisto et al. (2020)):

Conditions

Value

P(Severe | Symptomatic, Risky)

0.25

P(Severe | Symptomatic, no Risky)

0.05

P(Severe | Asymptomatic)

0.0

We model the day in which the severity event is triggered with a uniform distribution during
the illness period:
P(day) = CDF-Uniform(x < day),

184

and the occurrence of severity in a given day as follows:
P(Severe | day) = P(day) P(Severe | Conditions).

185
186
187

• I + Deadliness. This condition indicates progression of the disease to a critical state, which in
turn represents an even higher threat of death, as it is deﬁned in the I : E transition. The
event occurs according to the following parameters (see Tuomisto et al. (2020)):

188

189
190

Conditions

Value

P(Deadly | Severe)

0.25

P(Deadly | no Severe)

0.05

Similarly, we model the day in which the deadliness event is triggered uniformly distributed
within the illness period:
P(day) = CDF-Uniform(x < day).

191

So the occurrence of deadliness in a given day is:
P(Deadly | day) = P(day) P(Deadly | Conditions).

• I + Hospitalised. This event indicates proper care for the severity condition is taking place;
hence it lowers the chance of death, as it is deﬁned in the I : E transition. The occurrence of
this event depends on the availability of hospital-beds (deﬁned as a model parameter). Basically, as soon as a bed is emptied, it is assigned to an agent with severe condition in waiting (if
any), until the maximum capacity is reached. When a patient is admitted, its state is switched
to hospitalised, tested and conﬁrmed (the latter two in case it was not previously diagnosed).
Occupation and demand of these beds are updated on a daily basis; notice that beds are
released when infectious agents recover or are translated to ICU treatment or die.
• I + ICU-admitted. Similar to the previous event, this one refers to proper treatment for the
critical condition is being given, hence lowering the chance of death, as it is deﬁned in the I :
E transition. The assignment, discharge and availability of ICU beds is performed analogous
to hospital beds, on a daily basis but considering patients with a deadly condition instead.
Here, ICU beds are released when agents recover or die.

Since dead may occur in any day during the illness period, we modelled the chance of the day
of fatality as a triangular distribution with peak in the middle of such individual’s particular
recovery period (half-recover-period). In other words, we assume:
P(day) = CDF-Triangular(x < day | half-recovery-period),

211
212

where CDF stands for cumulative distributed function. As a result, we compute the actual
probability of death in a given day as follows:
P(Extinct | day) = P(day) P(Extinct | Conditions).

• I : R (recovery). An infected individual gets cured when he reaches the end of his recovery
period. If this happens, our model assumes the individual acquires immunity to the virus and
cannot be re-infected. In the simulation view, agents with this condition are coloured white.

Agent design and behaviour
We designed agents to represent individual people residing in a hypothetical city, whose attributes include: spatial
location, household location and zone or district of residence. The simulation traces an individual disease path for
every agent, from susceptible to recovery or death, according to the SIRE+CARDS epidemic model described above.
Each agent is assigned a daily routine consisting of going
outdoors and returning home with a commuting distance
range randomly chosen from 25, 50, 100, 200 unit steps;
the actual route the agent follows varies slightly due to random ﬂuctuations in his orientation. In addition the length
of each step can be set as a global parameter between 0.1
and 1 units. Similarly, the day length can be deﬁned with a
given number of ticks in the range between 600 and 2400.
Individuals interact by random contacts they make
within his/her household or during their daily routines outdoors. Virus transmission occurs when proximity within a
spatial radius of 0.5 units of an infectious individual with
Figure 2. Simulation ﬂow chart.
other susceptible individuals; the chance of contagion depends on what mask protection intervention is applied, as
it was explained before. Besides, our model does not consider incubation periods; infectiousness is assumed to start as soon as contagion occurs, with no
difference in infectivity between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers, or variable infectiousness between individuals. On recovery from the disease, individuals are assumed to acquire immunity to the virus so they cannot be re-infected. In this model all deaths are considered to be
caused by COVID-19. No births are taken into consideration during the timeline of the simulation.
A high-level depiction of the ﬂow of events that is applied in each iteration of the simulation is
shown in Figure 2. Next, we provide a brief description of each of these events.

• lifestyle: simulates the daily routine of agents, which currently encompasses moving the
agent ahead towards its current destination, or head it backwards home if he has reached
his range limit. In any case, conﬁrmed patients are not allowed to move around.
If zonal enforcement is on, the movement is restricted only within the periphery of the zone
where the agent is resident. In the simulation view, residents of different zones are identiﬁed
with different shapes and colours (the latter coincides with the colour of their zone’s ground).
• epidemic: here the spread of the epidemic is simulated, with transmissions occurring in
proportion to proximity between infectious and susceptibles and probability of contagion. If
a transmission happens, the new case is initially characterised as not conﬁrmed, not tested,
not severe and not deadly. The condition of asymptomatic and/or risky of a new case is
deﬁned according to the corresponding probabilities set as model parameters. Lastly, the
agent’s recovery period in days is assigned as a random variate with a Gaussian distribution
centred at the avg-duration model parameter.
• isolation: when the Case Isolation NPI (CI) is enforced, those symptomatic cases that have
not been tested yet are sent to their households and are tagged as conﬁrmed cases so they
have to stay isolated (their movement is restricted). If CI is lifted during the simulation, the
conﬁned cases are tagged back as not conﬁrmed and therefore, are set free to leave its isolation.
• quarantine: when the Home Quarantine NPI (HQ) is enforced, housemates of conﬁrmed
cases are sent home and their movement is restricted; they will stay quarantined unless HQ
is lifted during the simulation.
• distancing: when the Social Distancing NPI (SD) is enabled, every agent stays away of any
other agent within a radius of the minimal distance model parameter. For this purpose the
agent chooses the closest agent in its vicinity and heads into the opposite direction.
• sentinel: when the Sentinel Testing NPI (ST) is enforced, ambulances move around the entire region performing mass-testing of any agent found on their ways. Therefore each ambulance looks around its vicinity for agents that has not been tested before, perform the test on
them, mark these persons as tested, and for those with positive result, sent them to isolation
marked as conﬁrmed cases. Each ambulance is supplied with a stock of tests deﬁned as a
model parameter (%-tests); however if they run out of tests during the simulation it is possible
to replenish them with a new supply of stock. We remark that this NPI can be applied locally
within each zone if the zonal? parameter is enabled. Lastly, notice that once a healthy agent
is tested it will not be tested again in the future, unless it gets infected in which case his tested
condition is reset, as it was previously explained in the epidemic event.
• lockdown: when the Total Lockdown NPI (TL) is enforced, all the agents are conﬁned at home,
except for a few with movement permits. The latter is intended to represent people going
out for food or medicines or workers of essential jobs; they are chosen randomly every day
according to a proportion of the population deﬁned with the model parameter %-permits. Because our model considers zonal divisions, hence it is possible to lift the restriction in one or
many zones while keeping the remainder locked down (this can be done tapping the unlock
zone button in the simulation panel). If TL is disabled during the simulation, all the agents are
unlocked so they can move freely, unless of course, they are conﬁrmed cases. TL enforcement or lifting have effect from midnight on the next day of simulation, after having been
applied.
• illness: in this step, progress of illness for the entire population of infectious agents is simulated according to the transition events of the SIRE+CARDS model described earlier. The
sequence of application of these events is the following: I : R, I : E, I + Severity, I + Deadliness,
I + Hospitalised, and lastly, I + ICU-admitted.
• clock: this event updates the day and hour counters which depends on the number of ticks
(or iterations) that are needed to complete a simulated day, as deﬁned by the corresponding
model parameter.

• indicators: here the simulations statistics and epidemic indicators are computed, including
the following:
1. History of the number of infected people per day during the timeline of the simulation.
2. Two estimates of the reproduction number. The ﬁrst one uses a population-level approach that takes cumulative incidence data at a given day, namely the attack rate (Obadia et al., 2012); here 𝑅0 is computed as the inverse of the proportion of susceptibles
after the last day of simulation of the epidemic (Dietz, 1993):
𝑅0 =

299
300

ln 𝑆0 − ln 𝑆𝑡
𝑆0 − 𝑆𝑡

where 𝑆0 is the initial amount of susceptibles at the time of introduction of the ﬁrst
infected, and 𝑆𝑡 the susceptibles at time 𝑡.
The second estimate is computed with a individual-based approach, computed directly
by tracing agents, contacts and contagions individually throughout the epidemic timeline, and then taking the average:
1 ∑ 𝑡
𝑅̄ 0 = 𝑡
𝐶
|𝐶 | 𝑘 𝑘

301
302
303
304
305
306
307
308

here 𝐶𝑘𝑡 is the number of contagions made by agent 𝑘 up to time 𝑡, and |𝐶𝑡 | is the count
of agents that have actually made a contagion up to that point. In this sense, instead
of making assumptions about the value of reproduction number, we measure it as an
emergent property of the epidemic dynamics. Both indicators, 𝑅0 and 𝑅̄ 0 usually follow
similar trends, although in some scenarios they may differ amply, as it has been previously reported (Breban et al., 2007), as it can be also veriﬁed in the corresponding plot
output section of the simulation tool.

ln 𝑁𝐼𝑡 − ln 𝑁𝐼𝑡−1

where 𝑁𝐼𝑡 is the number of infected agents at time 𝑡.
4. Additionally, the following statistics are recorded or obtained: total amount of healthy
agents (susceptible or recovered), total amount of deaths, total amount of infected agents,
amount of infected and conﬁrmed agents today, new cases today, number of positive
tested, and herd immunity percentage. Lethality is reported as infection fatality rate (IFR)
and case fatality rate (CFR) which are computed each day as the cumulative number of
deaths per cumulative number of total infections or conﬁrmed cases, respectively.
5. Lastly, since these indicators vary with respect to time along the duration of the simulation, we keep record of a number of plots showing the dynamics of the epidemics: SIRE
plot (Susceptibles, Infectious, Recovered, Extinct), I+CARDS plot (Infectious, Conﬁrmed,
Asymptomatic, Risky, Severe, Deadly), Hospital and ICU demand plot, and R0 and Doubling Time plots.

Simulation Tool
The simulator was developed in the NetLogo language v.6.1 (May 13, 2019). It is available as free
software and can be accesed via the ModelingCommons web server in the following URL: http:
//modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/6374. To experiment with the tool, choose the “Run in
NetLogo Web” tab. NetLogo is a widely popular software platform for ABMs, which further to the
simulation language, also integrates a graphical view area and a test-bed for experimental design
(Wilensky and Rand, 2015).
The developed tool implements the NPIs, epidemic SIRE+CARDS model and agent behaviour
rules described previously. A snapshot of the simulation view area is shown in Figure 3. In there,

agents are represented with different shapes according to the zone where they reside. The colour
of the agent also represents its extended state (healthy: same colour as zone ground; immune:
white; sick: red, or yellow if asymptomatic; dead: black ×). Special-purpose agents designed to implement some of the NPIs such as households for home-quarantine and ambulances for sentineltesting can also be seen.
The control panel is organised in sections related to general, city and COVID-19 settings, monitors of epidemic indicators, parameters, action commands to execute the simulation, and a dedicated section for NPI activation with their corresponding parameters. A snapshot of the panel is
shown in Figure 4. Besides, the tool also includes another panel with plot outputs showing the
dynamics of the simulation, as it was mentioned in the previous section. An example of the plots
obtained in a particular execution of the model is shown in Figure 5.

In this section we describe a number of scenarios conceived to illustrate how to perform a rapid
assessment of the effect of NPIs, or combination of NPIs, to contain the spread of the epidemics
in the population of agents. We start with a baseline scenario where no measure is taken (Do
Nothing). Then we simulate scenarios where the individual NPIs are applied. Finally, we simulate
scenarios where these NPIs are combined with the zonal enforcement strategy in order to verify
its potential impact. The description of these scenarios is given in Table 1. General, city and COVID19 parameters used in all simulations are deﬁned in Figure 2. For each scenario, the epidemic is
assumed to begin with a “patient zero” seeded randomly in any zone of the city at 0d:12h after the
start of the simulation. The application of the conﬁgured NPI policies begins at 04d:00h.
For each scenario we performed an experiment consisting of 30 repetitions of execution of
the simulation model for a timeline of 60 days. We collected the results of the count of healthy
agents, deaths and immunity rate, as well as some epidemic indicators obtained at the end of the
simulation time. Average results are reported in Table 3 and Table 4.

These results hint at the effectiveness of the different NPI strategies. Across all the scenarios,
the deaths count varies from 65.1 to 5.3, whereas immunity rate ranges from 100% to 7%. Regarding individual NPI scenarios, that Sentinel Testing reaches the highest count of healthy people
(381± 13 in average), of which about 34% acquired immunity to the disease, while also achieving
the lowest rates of mortality of approximately 4% (19±13 deaths); hence, ST seems to be the single NPI yielding the major impact in the epidemics outcome. Should authorities need to prioritise
application of interventions, these assessment suggests ST should be given top priority.
Now regarding the count of healthy survivors, Mask Protection for everyone achieves the second best result (361±43) followed by Total Lockdown (345±25). This is an interesting result, taking
into account that ﬁnancial cost of providing population with masks can be negligible compared
to the economic and social costs of maintaining lengthy lockdowns. On the other hand it is also
interesting to notice that Social Distancing when 50% of population willing to comply, yields a very
low impact (survivors: 339±8, deaths: 58±7, immunity: 97%), only comparable with the Do Nothing
scenario (survivors: 335±9, deaths: 65.1±8.7, immunity: 100%). The latter suggests that more than
half of the population should embrace distancing habits if one expect this NPI to produce any mitigation impact, maybe by reinforcing awareness through extensive coverage education campaigns.
We observe that Mask Protection of healthy people only, also obtains similar ﬁgures to DN, yielding
a low impact NPI. MP of sicks, in contrast, is more effective in reducing the mortality rate.

Another interesting ﬁnding related to 𝑅0 , shows that Mask Protection-everyone obtained the
best result (0.84), followed by Sentinel Testing (1.19), and then by Total Lockdown (1.54). On the
other hand, the 𝑅̄ 0 number that is computed directly by tracing the contacts of agents, yielded a
best result with Mask Protection-everyone again (1.22), then Sentinel Testing (1.72), followed by
Social Distancing (1.87). The latter corroborates the observation regarding the prioritisation that
should be given to ST or MP interventions, plus education campaigns. Moreover, the two estimates
of reproduction number can differ amply, particularly in the DN scenario (𝑅0 = 21,94, 𝑅̄ 0 = 1.97), as
it has been noted elsewhere (Breban et al., 2007)). In view of these results, we believe the tracing
approach 𝑅̄ 0 is a more realistic estimate for epidemics ABM simulations.
On the other hand, we found that the Zone Enforcement NPI exhibits interesting indicators
suggesting its potential beneﬁt for mitigation impact. Compared to the Do Nothing scenario, ZE
improves death rate (from 65±9 to 37±18), CFR (from 69±5% to 56±8%) and IFR (from 16±2% to
13±3%). Since this is one of the distinctive features of our model, we thus decided to assess the
effect of combining every individual NPI with the ZE restriction.
Interestingly enough, across all scenarios of NPIs combined with ZE, more effective mitigation
indicators were obtained. For example, survivor and death count is better than any other scenario: TL+ZE (survivors: 394±3, death: 6±3), ST+ZE (survivors: 395±5, deaths: 5±5) and MP everyone+ZE (survivors: 389±13, deaths: 5±4). SD+ZE achieves herd immunity rate of 31%, which may be
favourable for protection against a subsequent second wave of virus spread, taking into account
that this scenario assumes that only 50% of population respects distancing. Regarding case fatality
rate (CFR) these zone-restricted NPIs obtained ranges between 12% and 59%, whilst the infected
fatality rate (IFR) obtained more optimistic values between 12% and 17%, a result that conﬁrms
the overestimation phenomenon when only oﬃcial conﬁrmed cases are accounted rather than
actual contagions (Verity et al., 2020). Another observation concerning herd immunity is that following Social Distancing then comes Case Isolation (deaths: 56±20, immunity: 90±30%) and Mask
Protection for sicks only (deaths: 50±21, immunity: 83±33%); then Total Lockdown (deaths: 27±14,
immunity: 47±24%) and Sentinel Testing (deaths: 19±17, immunity: 34±21%).
On a different note, a noticeable pattern in these experiments is the high variability of the average results, which can be explained by two reasons. Firstly, a common theme in all these NPIs
is that they perform isolation of cases as soon as they are discovered: CI by self-isolation of symptomatic cases, ST by immediate isolation of asymptomatic tested positive, and TL by mandatory
conﬁning of both symptomatic or asymptomatic (or healthy for that matter) people. Secondly,
since the experiments were designed in a way that only one infected agent (patient zero) is randomly seeded at the beginning of the simulation, it is likely that in some repetitions, as soon as
these NPIs take effect, patient zero can be sent by pure chance to isolation just before he or she
can transmit virus to other agents; therefore, in those executions indicators may remain unaltered
whilst in other repetitions the epidemics effectively unfolds fully. This kind of variability is actually
an inherent property of ABM models (Ahmed et al., 2012), one that may resemble more closely the
natural phenomena they simulate (take for example, the way the COVID-19 epidemics has evolved
in Latin America differs amply between countries, despite sharing similar socio-economical conditions and that likewise NPIs measures have been taken by their local governments).
In order to perform an analysis ensuring the epidemics fully develops across all repetitions, we
embarked in another set of experiments where rather than beginning with a single infection of
a patient zero, the simulation starts with a small outbreak of 5% of the population representing
“imported cases”, distributed randomly in different zones of the city. Again we run 30 repetitions
per scenario for a timeline of 60 days. The average results are reported in Table 5 and Table 6.
The ﬁrst observation in this set of outbreak experiments is that the results exhibit a smaller
variability, conﬁrming the fully unfolding intuition explained before. Moreover, compared to the
patient zero experiments, the overall trend can also be identiﬁed here, except that with higher
numbers. Let us examine for example, the death count here varies from 65.7 in the DN scenario
to 33.2, compared to 65.1 and 5.3 in the same scenario for the patient zero experiments.

The latter increase is caused of course, by the larger amount of carriers at the beginning of the
simulation (20 individuals or 5%) yielding a higher burden on the hospital facilities at the peak of
the epidemics. On the contrary, immunisation also rises in the MP everyone+ZE scenario to a 56%,
from a 7% in the earlier experiment. The higher levels of immunity achieved in all the scenarios are
beneﬁcial to effectively suppress the contagion or prevent it in a forthcoming second wave of the
epidemics. Similar trends can be identiﬁed when comparing the other indicators with the earlier
patient zero experiments.
The main ﬁnding however, in our opinion, is that simultaneous application of the Zone Enforcing intervention with the other NPIs, again yields an improvement on the mitigation impact compared to the single NPI scenarios (more survivors, fewer deaths). Signiﬁcant differences between
the single and their corresponding +ZE scenarios (p-value < 0.01) are highlighted in the tables. To
further illustrate the effect of the application of Zone Enforcing, in the Appendix we included a
comparison of the epidemic dynamics between arbitrary executions of the simulation for each
pair of scenarios (single vs its corresponding combination with ZE). Particularly, the “ﬂatenning” of
the infectious curve can be seen in the +ZE plots, both as a lower height of the infectious peak and
in some cases as a longer tail shifted towards a later time in hours, with respect to the start of the
simulation.

Conclusion
Given the complex nature of human behavior and virus infection, attempting to model every mechanism of the COVID-19 epidemic may prove diﬃcult; necessary assumptions have to be made to
simplify the representation of the agents and their interactions. Our aim was to focus on ﬁnding emergencies in the dynamic of this disease, considering a broad set of traits for the agents;
in real life of course, there are many properties of interest that may impact the growing of the
epidemics. Here we omitted detailed structures such as age, gender, profession, health status,
or family, school and work clusters, transportation, job shifts or economic impacts. Clearly, those
properties can be examined as extensions of the model, in the hope of capturing additional hidden
patterns that may yield a better assessment of the effects NPIs can have taking additional mechanisms into consideration. Nonetheless, the results obtained indicate that the proposed model can
be a useful tool in relation to a rapid assessment of the potential impact of combinations of NPIs
at different stages of the contagion.
Overall, our ﬁndings suggest three relevant recommendations. In general, mass-testing (ST as
we denote it in our model) is the one intervention that authorities should give priority to mitigate
the impact of COVID-19, providing for this purpose with suﬃcient stock of tests to medical units
performing random testing campaigns. Besides, Mask Protection for everyone, is even a cheaper
strategy authorities should strengthen as an alternative to declaring costly lengthy total lockdowns.
In addition, the proposed zonal enforcing NPI proved to be useful to boost the mitigation impact of combination of other individual NPIs. Although this seems an appealing ﬁnding, practical
application of said zonal enforcing may require logistic, residential and economical adjustments,
since people usually reside and work in different districts of a city. Therefore the feasibility of
limiting mobility of people within districts will depend on the urban planning and development
of suﬃcient decentralised infrastructure, such as industrial, residential, technological, commercial
and ﬁnancial hubs distributed in a way that motivate people to reside and work within the same
district. This may not be feasible to achieve for the current COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in
cities in Latin America where proper urban zonal planning is unsatisfactory, but it is an alluring
idea to start exploring as a preventive measure to counter new epidemics that may come in the
forthcoming future.
Finally, interesting gaps remain to be addressed in future work. Some of the ideas we are considering are: expanding the model to include more realistic attributes regarding patients and epidemic dynamics, such as differentiated infectiousness taking into account symptomatic structures
associated with age and gender; also considering incubation periods, co-morbidity risk stratiﬁcation with age windows, inclusion of conglomeration centres (that is, mass transportation, schools,
cinemas, hospitals), as well as the estimation of indicators of economic impacts and the study of
the importance of educational aspects in the habits of collective social intelligence that may be
beneﬁcial for the mitigation power of NPIs.
