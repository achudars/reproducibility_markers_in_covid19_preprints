Abstract
Rationale: The progress of COVID-19 from moderate to severe may be precipitous,
while the heterogenous characteristics of the disease pose challenges to the
management of these patients.
Objectives: To characterize the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients
with COVID-19 during two successive waves.
Methods: We leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19
(SPARCOL) study and collected data from consecutive patients requiring admission to
the intensive care unit from April 1st to December 31st, 2020.
Measurements and Main Results: Of 252 patients, 81 (32%) required intubation and
mechanical ventilation. Of them, 17 (20.9%) were intubated during the first wave, while
64 (79%) during the second wave. The most prominent difference between the two
waves was the overall survival (first wave 58.9% vs. second wave 15.6%, adjusted pvalue=0.006). This difference is reflected in the prolonged hospitalization during the
first wave. The mean ICU length of stay (19.1 vs. 11.7 days, p=0.022), hospital length
of stay (28.5 vs. 17.1 days, p=0.012), and days on ventilator (16.7 vs. 11.5, p=0.13)
were higher during the first wave. A significant difference between the two waves was
the development of bradycardia. In the first wave, 2 (11.7%) patients developed sinus
bradycardia only after admission to the intensive care unit, while in the second wave,
63 (98.4%) patients developed sinus bradycardia during hospitalization.
Conclusions: Survival of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower
during the second wave. The majority of these patients developed sinus bradycardia
during hospitalization.

Introduction
Although several months have been passed after the inception of the SARSCoV-2 pandemic, the global numbers of critically ill patients with severe coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) are increasing in many European countries. The progress of
the disease from moderate to severe may be precipitous requiring life-sustaining
interventions and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (1,2). For example, in the
early stages of the disease, patients may be characterized by mild hypoxemia and a
hyperdynamic circulatory state with high cardiac index (3), but as the disease
progresses, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high left ventricular filling
pressure, and heart failure may ensue (4,5).
The heterogenous characteristics of COVID-19 pose challenges to the
management of these patients (6). Intubation and mechanical ventilation may improve
outcome, but may aggravate lung injury and induce circulatory derangement as well.
Of note, the 24-h mortality after tracheal intubation has been reported 2-10.4% (7,8),
but the effects of peri-intubation interventions are largely unknown and may differ
between outbreaks. In addition, a range of multiorgan complications following COVID19 infection may develop and further aggravate the clinical course and prognosis (9).
To better describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with
COVID-19, we leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19
(SPARCOL) study to assess the clinical characteristics and interventions used in
patients requiring ICU admission during the two COVID-19 spikes.

Materials and methods
The SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19 study
The SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19 is an ongoing multi-center
observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04590794) which primary
purpose is to characterize levels of biomarker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator
receptor (suPAR) and its association with respiratory complications, admission to ICU,
organ injury, and survival of patients with COVID-19. Participating centers include:
University of Thessaly, Larisa, Greece; the Hippokration University Hospital, Athens,
Greece; the Evangelismos University Hospital, Athens, Greece; and the University of
Copenhagen at Hvidovre, Denmark. Ethical approval was provided by the Ethical
Committee of the University Hospital of Larisa (IRB no. 17543), Larisa, Greece on 24
April 2020. The study was performed according to national and international
guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients.
Inclusion criteria for this study were: (1) adult (≥18 years old) patients
hospitalized primarily for COVID-19; (2) a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
diagnosed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of
nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples; (3) at least one blood sample collected at
admission and stored for biomarker testing; and (4) admission to ICU.
Study design and outcomes definitions
For the purpose of this study, we collected data from consecutive patients
hospitalized for COVID-19 (n=252) during the period of April 1st to December 31st,
2020, the date the database was locked for the purpose of this analysis. Furthermore,
we divided the study period into two smaller ones according to the duration of the two

COVID-19 waves in most European countries (March 2020 - July 2020 and August
2020 - December 2020).
Local investigators screened and reported all intubations occurring in the
emergency department, ICU, and wards during the study period. Manual chart review
was used to gather details of the demographics and past medical history, peri-intubation
period, laboratory studies, ICU course, and outcomes. All patients were followed until
the 30th day post-discharge or death. We excluded from this analysis patients with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not primarily admitted for COVID-19,
patients with incomplete data, patients with pre-existing severe cardiac or respiratory
disease, such as heart failure, more than mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
or pulmonary vascular disease, patients with pacemaker or implantable cardioverterdefibrillator, and patients who underwent intubation following a cardiac arrest.
The primary aim of the study was to assess the differences in the clinical
characteristics and outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU
admission between the two waves. Secondary aims were to evaluate the incidence and
nature of major complications during hospitalization, including intubation-related
major complications, and characterize levels of various inflammatory biomarkers and
their association with outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Intubation-related
complications were defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following events:
(a) aggravation of hypoxemia (defined as SpO2<80% or by a decrease in the preinduction SpO2 value of more than 20%); (b) severe cardiovascular collapse [systolic
arterial pressure (SAP)<65 mmHg recorded once or SAP <90 mmHg for >30 minutes
or new need/increase of vasopressor/inotrope support and/or fluid load > 15 ml/kg); (c)
cardiac arrhythmia; (d) cardiac arrest; (e) other outcomes (incidence of difficult
intubation, ‘cannot intubate cannot oxygenate’ scenario, emergency front of neck

airway, esophageal intubation, dental injury or airway injury, pneumothorax,
pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or aspiration of gastric contents).
We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guidelines for observational cohort studies (10).
Data collection and monitoring
The data collected included details at presentation, past medical history, home
medications, hospitalization course, and outcomes. Laboratory testing included general
blood count; biochemical profile including levels of BUN, creatinine, protein, albumin,
high-sensitive C-reactive protein

(hs-CRP),

ferritin,

D-Dimer,

and lactate

dehydrogenase; arterial blood gases; and suPAR levels at admission. All serum samples
were obtained on admission to hospital, before any treatment or non-invasive/invasive
ventilation. The data analysis was based on predefined data points on a prospective data
collection form. The authors and laboratory technicians were blinded to clinical data
and measurements until the end of the study and all data were analyzed. Also, an
independent data and safety monitoring research staff monitored safety, ethical, and
scientific aspects of the study, while an independent enrollment research staff was
responsible for exclusion of all patients not meeting inclusion criteria.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R v4.0. The non-parametric MannWhitney test was used to observe differences between numerical observations in the
first and second wave. Additionally, the chi-square test of independence was applied to
the categorical observations. In both cases, the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery
rate correction was applied in the resulting P values to account for the multiple number
of tests. Adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. Spearman’s rho

coefficient was used for linear correlation. To assess the impact of the variables of
interest (summarized in Table 5) to overall survival, we have fitted a logistic regression
statistical model with survival as the dependent variable and the other variables as
independent variables. For each variable the respective odds ratio and p-value was
computed. No adjustment was applied in the resulting p-values from this model.

Results
During the period April 1st to December 31st, 252 consecutive patients were
hospitalized for COVID-19 and 81 (32%) required intubation and mechanical
ventilation and were included in the study. Of them, 17 (20.9%) were intubated during
the first wave, while 64 (79%) during the second wave. Their demographic and clinical
characteristics are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
A significant difference between the two waves was the development of
bradycardia after admission. In the first wave, 2 (11.7%) patients developed sinus
bradycardia only after ICU admission (at the 14th and 28th day, respectively), while in
the second wave, 63 (98.4%) patients developed sinus bradycardia before admission to
ICU (Fig. 1). In the second wave, the average time for development of bradycardia was
5 and 10 days from admission and onset of symptoms, respectively. In all patients,
bradycardia developed without clinically detectable myocardial necrosis, while none of
them was receiving drugs inducing bradycardia, such as hydroxychloroquine,
moxifloxacin, azithromycin, or remdesivir. In all patients, bradycardia was diagnosed
and monitored with serial electrocardiograms, cardiac telemetry, and/or continuous
electrocardiography.

Peri-intubation period
Oxygen administration during laryngoscopy was used in both waves, with highflow nasal cannula being the preferred method during the second one (p<0.001).
However, oxygen administration during laryngoscopy did not seem to prevent
desaturation during or after intubation (p=0.53). Peri-intubation characteristics and
complications are presented in Table 3, as well as in Tables E1 and E2 in the online
data supplement. No difference in overall survival (p=0.85) and risk of developing any
post-intubation complications (p=0.28) were found in patients intubated using rapid vs.
delayed sequence intubation.
Clinical course and outcome after admission to ICU
The most prominent difference between the two waves was the overall survival
(first wave 58.9% vs. second wave 15.6%, adjusted p-value=0.006). This difference is
reflected in the prolonged hospitalization during the first wave. The mean ICU length
of stay during the first and second wave was 19.1 and 11.7 days (p=0.022), respectively.
Accordingly, the mean hospital length of stay was 28.5 and 17.1 days (p=0.012),
respectively, while the number of days on ventilator were also greater in the first wave
(16.7 vs. 11.5, p=0.13) (Table 4). In multivariable analysis, only increasing age was
associated with mortality (Table 5).
Patient characteristics and disease progression after admission to the ICU are
presented in Tables E3-E7 in the online data supplement. Vasoactive drugs were
administered in both waves, but the doses of isoprenaline and norepinephrine were
higher during the second wave (Tables E8, E9, and Figure E4 in the online data
supplement). The incidence of complications after admission to the ICU was higher in
the second wave, but not statistically significant (59% vs. 75%, p=0.3114) (see Table

E10 in the online data supplement). We found no differences in acute coronary
syndromes (23.5% vs. 9.3%, p=0.245) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (29.4% vs.
15.6%, p= 0.342) during ICU stay between patients of the first and second wave,
respectively. The causes of death during the first wave were respiratory failure and
sepsis (n=3). During the second wave, the most common causes of death were
respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (n=49).
Biomarkers of inflammation
In total, 66 (81.4%) patients had suPAR ≥ 5 ng/ml and 52 (64.2%) patients had
suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml. Mean suPAR was higher in the second wave, but after p-value
adjustment, the difference between the two waves was statistically non-significant (7.33
vs. 9.3, p=0.023, adjusted p=0.1). We conducted a further analysis after dividing the
patients into two subgroups, survivors vs. non-survivors, and found a positive
correlation between suPAR and ICU length of stay in survivors (rho = 0.225, p=0.33).
In addition, we found a statistically significant negative correlation between suPAR and
ICU length of stay (rho= - 0.322, p=0.011) among non-survivors (Fig. 2).
Lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels at presentation were
associated with better survival (unadjusted p=0.034) (see Figure E1 in the online data
supplement), but in multivariate analysis, hs-CRP was not associated with outcome.
Ferritin at admission did not differ between the first and second wave, but lower ferritin
levels were associated with prolonged days on ventilator and hospital stay (unadjusted
p=0.033 and 0.026, respectively) (see Figures E2 and E3 in the online data supplement).

Discussion
In this multicenter observational study, the most prominent finding was the
difference in the severity of the disease and in overall survival between the first and
second wave. Another significant characteristic of the second wave was the
development of sinus bradycardia during hospitalization without clinically detectable
myocardial necrosis nor being induced by drugs, indicating involvement of cardiac
conduction system with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not progress in parallel with
pulmonary abnormalities (5).
The ICU mortality rate among patients with COVID-19 has been reported to be
30.6%, although it may increase up to 93% in mechanically ventilated patients with
ARDS (11). In our study, the majority of critically ill patients was admitted during the
second wave, with mortality being more than doubled (84.4% vs. 41.1%) despite the
comparable patient characteristics between the two outbreak waves. This is the first
report on mortality during the second wave in Greece, and is consistent with the upsurge
in COVID-19 witnessed in Europe since September 2020 (12). Our findings are in
contrast to studies from other countries reporting a lower disease severity and/or
mortality in the second wave (13), but the degree of hypoxemia in our patients was
among the most severe of those reported worldwide (1,4,7,8,13). Our results confirm
that the risk of severe adverse outcomes and death in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals
shows extreme stratification according to age, which may improve understanding of the
disease and patient management (14).
Other settings in our country have reported a lower mortality (32%) for overall
ICU admissions during the first wave, highlighting the effects of an overburdened
medical system on mortality rates rather than the severity of the disease per se (15).

However, in a recently published Swedish registry-based cohort study of patients
admitted from 6 March to 6 May 2020, the ICU mortality was even lower (23.1%) (16).
The healthcare system in Sweden has never been overwhelmed, but until 10 November
2020 they reported one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 deaths per inhabitant
globally (17). Therefore, the increased severity and mortality during the second wave
in our study could be attributed to a more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variant (18), which
may have been introduced and transmitted regionally long before the first relevant
announcement by the Hellenic National Organization for Public Health on December
23, 2020 (19). Continued community-based transmission of the European or other
strains has been reported in several populations and may result in unknown mutations
that are associated with severe disease, while they are usually identified much later from
the peak of an outbreak (20). This is a major issue in countries like ours, which followed
a strategy focused hard lockdowns and on hospital preparedness but failed to reinforce
primary/community care and epidemiological surveillance (21,22).
A striking finding was the development of sinus bradycardia in 98.4% of the
patients of the second wave without clinically detectable myocardial necrosis or after
treatment with medications affecting heart rate. The average time for development of
bradycardia was 5 and 10 days from admission and onset of symptoms, respectively
(23), which is significantly shorter compared to other cohorts (5). The development of
bradycardia in our patients may reflect the activation of the cholinergic nervous system
in an effort to regulate the inflammatory response (24). However, recent evidence
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein may bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and
adversely affect their function by preventing acetylcholine’s action, causing
dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and leading to uncontrolled
immune response and cytokine storm (24,25). Heart rate should normally have

increased in these patients, but we did not observe such change. The combination of
bradycardia and uncontrolled inflammatory response may be a novel clinical
manifestation related to a new SARS-CoV-2 variant. In addition, the absence of
myocardial necrosis together with the increase in D-Dimer in our patients may indicate
an involvement through an uncharacterized pathway. In patients with COVID-19,
dysfunctional endothelium may display a hypercoagulant/prothrombotic/pro‐oxidant
state and impairs microvascular reactivity (26). The latter, together with the increased
levels of inflammatory mediators, enhances mechanical stress of cardiomyocytes and
metabolic demands of conduction muscle cells, promoting metabolic instability and
conduction disorders (23,27,28).
Although we did not find an association between bradycardia and outcome, our
sample does not allow for a firm conclusion. Until now, patient characteristics, baseline
ECG features, respiratory function, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and myocardial
injury have an insufficient discriminatory power to identify subjects at increased risk
for the development of new ECG changes (5). Nevertheless, these data suggest an
inhibitory influence of the virus on cardiac conduction system and considering the high
mortality in our study, we recommend close monitoring of patients with COVID-19
(28). Also, the use of drugs affecting the conduction system of the heart should be
avoided in patients with sinus bradycardia or other conduction disorders, while the use
of anticholinergics, such as atropine, could inhibit the protective effects of the
cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.
A typical feature of our patients was the rapid progression to ARDS
approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms. However, time to intubation did
not differ significantly between the two waves, although it was longer in the second
one. The reasons for this were the concern that early intubation of every hypoxemic

patient would be impossible due to the limited ICU capacity and resources, and the
possible beneficial effects of avoiding early endotracheal intubation in significantly
hypoxemic patients (29). Also, this practice was based in part on evidence from other
ICUs showing that a strategy of early intubation was not associated with higher ICUmortality, fewer ventilator-free days, or fewer ICU-free days than delayed or no
intubation (15,30,31). Until now, optimal timing of initiation of invasive mechanical
ventilation in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure remains
unknown.
In this cohort, overall survival and post-intubation complications did not differ
significantly between rapid and delayed sequence intubation. Critically ill patients with
COVID-19 usually have low functional residual capacity and minimal physiological
reserve, which can prompt providers to try to secure the airway rapidly without
adequate preoxygenation. However, rapid sequence intubation may result in immediate
and profound desaturation even after a successful first intubation attempt (32). In
patients with respiratory failure, apneic oxygenation has been recommended to prevent
desaturation during intubation (33,34), but this technique did not prevent desaturation
during or after intubation in our patients (7,8,35). We agree that patients with COVID19 require detailed planning and strategy for tracheal intubation and therefore, delayed
sequence intubation may be a valuable technique for maximizing safety, especially in
ward patients with limited staff and equipment availability (8,32). This technique can
offer an alternative to rapid sequence intubation in patients who will not tolerate
preoxygenation or other peri-intubation procedures. However, the superiority of one
technique vs. the other must be investigated in randomized controlled studies.
In our study, ICU and hospital length of stay were higher during the first wave.
This is attributed mainly to the severity of COVID-19 and the increased mortality

during the second wave, and less to the differences in complications between the two
waves. For example, the percentage of ICU patients who were diagnosed with
ventilator-associated pneumonia in our study is lower when compared to other studies
(36,37). Considering that the mean number of days on ventilator was higher in the first
wave, the most possible explanation for the higher (but not statistically significant)
prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia during the second wave may be the
increased predisposition due to the increased severity of lung damage caused by
COVID-19 (38). Also, the cumulative risk of secondary sepsis increases with ICU stay
(38), and bacterial DNA and toxins have been discovered in all severely ill patients with
COVID-19 (39,40). Until now, clinically relevant sepsis and septic shock have been
reported in up to 60% of cases, which is in accordance with our results (first wave 47%,
second wave 50%) (41,42). On the other hand, respiratory failure and MODS were key
determinants of survival during the second wave. MODS was related to the direct and
indirect

suPAR has been shown to provide important indications for required early
admission and treatment in non-COVID-19 patients; the TRIAGE III trial including
4420 patients reported that suPAR ranged between 2.6 and 4.7 ng/ml in 30-day
survivors and between 6.7 and 11.8 ng/ml in 30-day non-survivors (43). The
dysregulation of the urokinase plasminogen activator/urokinase plasminogen activator
receptor system may be also a main cause of organ failure in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection and especially in those with chronic inflammation (44). A suPAR level
≥ 6 ng/ml has been independently associated with the development of severe respiratory
failure in patients with COVID-19 (45-47), which is in agreement with our results.

Moreover, we observed for the first time that a higher suPAR at presentation was
correlated with earlier death after ICU admission among non-survivors, while a lower
suPAR (but still >6 ng/ml) was correlated with prolonged ICU length of stay in
critically ill patients who survived. This finding is important because ferritin levels were
markedly increased in our patients, but their difference between the two waves did not
reach statistical significance. Although ferritin has been repeatedly reported as a potent
marker of disease severity (48), a smaller increase in ferritin levels at admission was
associated with prolonged days on ventilator and hospital stay, possibly reflecting a
reduced immune activation due to the milder form of the disease at that point.
Considering that patients with COVID-19 have heterogeneous cytokine profiles,
suPAR seems extremely promising as a prognostic marker in those with severe disease
and after ICU admission (49,50). Two ongoing large multicenter observational studies
whose primary purpose is to characterize levels of suPAR among various biomarkers
of inflammation and its association with in-hospital outcomes of patients with COVID19 are expected to conclude by the end of spring 2021.
The study has several strengths. It is a multicenter study that relied on collection
of clinical, laboratory, and outcome data throughout the COVID-19 hospitalization
during two successive outbreak waves, capturing a diverse patient population. Data
collection was systematic and all patients admitted/intubated during the period April 1st
to December 31st were enrolled. Our sample was limited to patients consecutively
hospitalized specifically for COVID-19 and without receiving any specific treatment
besides dexamethasone, allowing for a better description of the effect of SARS-CoV-2
infection on different organs of the human body. The major limitations of the present
study are the relatively small sample and its observational nature. Despite the careful
analysis, it is not possible to fully account for all potential confounders and therefore,

the study cannot be trusted per se as a basis of clinical decision. However, our findings
have significant implications for a better understanding of the epidemiology of COVID19 and for better planning and organization in the future.
The present study adds to the growing body of research that indicates
differences in the severity of COVID-19 and in overall survival between successive
outbreak waves. Moreover, it provides additional evidence with respect to the
involvement of cardiac conduction system with SARS-CoV-2. These findings may help
in the classification of novel phenotypes for informing treatment strategy and for
identifying populations that may benefit from early admission to ICU.
