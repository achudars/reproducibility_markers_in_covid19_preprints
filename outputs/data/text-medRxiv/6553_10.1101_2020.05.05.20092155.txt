A Divide and Conquer Strategy against the Covid-19 Pandemic?!
Patrick Mangat∗
Dated: 2020-05-05

Abstract
The concern about (socio-)economic consequences of collective lockdowns in the Covid19 pandemic calls for alternative strategies. We consider a divide and conquer strategy
in which a high risk group (HRG) is put on strict isolation, whereas the remainder of
the population is exposed to the virus, building up immunity against Covid-19. The
question is whether this strategy may suppress the effective reproduction number below
the critical value of Reff < 1 without further lockdown once the HRG is released from
isolation. While this proposal appears already rather academic, we show that Reff < 1 can
only be obtained provided that the HRG is less than ∼ 20 − 30% of the total population.
Hence, this strategy is likely to fail in countries with a HRG larger than the given upper
bound. In addition, we argue that the maximum infection rate occurring in this strategy
is likely to exceed realistic capacities of most health care systems. While the conclusion is
rather negative in this regard, we emphasise that the strategy of stopping the curve at an
early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic has a chance to work out. The required duration of
the lockdown is estimated to be τ ∼ 14 days/(1 − Reff ) (up to some order one factor) for
Reff < 1, provided a systematic tracing strategy of new infections exists for the subsequent
relaxation phase. In this context we also argue why Reff remains the crucial parameter
which needs to be accurately monitored and controlled.

Introduction

Most countries have been locked down for more than six weeks already. The goal of the
lockdown strategy is to avoid a collapse of the health care systems. However, this goes at the
cost of significant economic decline including growing debts and unemployment (for studies on
(socio-)economic impacts see e.g. [1–7]). While the Covid-19 pandemic directly threatens our
health, the link between economic growth and our health is rather implicit and non-trivial.
The lockdown particularly protects the so-called high risk group (HRG) [8–10], whereas the
economic consequences will affect the whole population. Consequently, in Germany (and
most likely in other countries as well) doubts have been raised whether the current mitigation
measures are proportionate.
In particular, it has been proposed whether it may suffice to impose isolations only for
the HRG, while the rest of the population is exposed to the virus (various discussions can be
found in German newspapers such as Spiegel Online). The hope behind this proposal is that
the decline of the economic growth is minimised while the health care system is kept stable
(because the non-HRG is less likely to require intensive treatment), see e.g. [1] for related
work in this direction. Apart from various practical issues with this proposal, this strategy
makes only sense if the effective reproduction number eventually drops below Reff < 1 once

the HRG can be released from the isolation. Of course, the hope is that Reff < 1 is reached
purely due to the immunity of the non-HRG. This would mean that the Covid-19 pandemic
is in control even without further measures afterwards.
We call this the divide and conquer strategy, because the population is divided into a HRG
and a non-HRG. Using the SIR-model [11] we prove that the divide and conquer strategy
requires the HRG to be less than approximately 20 − 30% of the whole population. Hence,
at least in Germany this strategy will most likely be unsuccessful. In addition, we argue that
realistic capacities of the German health care system are likely to be exceeded due to the
infections of the non-HRG in this strategy. We use the SIR-model, because it captures the
relevant mechanisms of a pandemic despite its simplicity.
This note is organised as follows. We briefly recall the basics of the SIR-model including an
application to Covid-19 and the flatten the curve strategy. Afterwards we apply the SIR-model
to the divide and conquer strategy. Finally, we summarise the importance of the reproduction
number in this crisis and propose a simple formula to estimate how long one needs to keep
Reff < 1 until a lockdown can be relaxed.

A primer on the SIR-model

This section recalls the basics of the SIR-model (following [12–14]) and briefly demonstrates
the dynamics in the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the problem with flattening the curve in
this context. Readers who are familiar with this model can skip to the next section.

2.1

The SIR-model

The SIR-model divides the population into susceptible (S), infectious (I) and recovered (R)
people. This is the origin of the name of the model developed in [11]. The total population
N is then given by
N =S+I +R .
(2.1)
The SIR-model assumes constant population, i.e. no deaths, births and migration. An infectious person will infect a susceptible person at a transmission rate β, and will recover at a
recovery rate γ. Any recovered person is assumed to be immune against the disease forever.
The system of differential equations then reads
Ṡ = −βSI ,
I˙ = βSI − γI ,

(2.2)

Ṙ = γI ,

(2.4)

(2.3)

where Ṡ = dS/dt (derivative of S with respect to time t) and likewise for I˙ and Ṙ. By adding
up those three differential equations one can easily see that Ṅ = 0, i.e. the total number of
population is indeed conserved.
A crucial parameter is the basic reproduction number R0 , which can be written at t = 0
as
R0 =

β
S(0) .
γ

(2.5)

The basic reproduction number tells us to how many people the disease is transmitted on
average due to one infectious individual. To see where (2.5) comes from, we suppose that at
t = 0 we have I(0) = 1. The probability of this infectious person to remain infected at time t

is p(t) = e−γt . Hence, the expectation value for the number of people this single person will
infect, is given by
Z ∞

Given R0 , the effective reproduction number Reff = R(t) is
R(t) =

S(t)
S(t) = R0
.
γ
S(0)

(2.7)

Hence, as the pandemic is progressing, one infectious person will infect fewer and fewer people
on average, because more and more people recover in the course of this pandemic.
Therefore, the effective reproduction number decreases automatically and, eventually, it
will drop below the critical value of Reff = 1. This is when herd immunity is reached.
To understand this in detail, we rewrite (2.3) in terms of R(t):
˙ = γ (R(t) − 1) I(t) .
I(t)

(2.8)

By linearising the differential equations one can rigorously prove that an epidemic occurs if
and only if R0 > 1. A less rigorous argument is the following. Initially, R(t) ' R0 because
S(t) ' S(0) ' N initially in a large population with only few infectious and recovered people.
Then, (2.8) immediately implies an exponential growth of infectious people, namely
I(t) ' I(0)eγ(R0 −1)t ,

(2.9)

at the beginning of the epidemic. For R0 > 1 the disease is spreading exponentially, whereas
for R0 < 1 the recovery is faster than the spread leading to exponential suppression. At
the critical value of R0 = 1 the number of new infections is compensated by the number of
recovered people (per time interval).
But once the number of immune people increases to a significant amount, the I-curve
deviates from an exponential function, and eventually reaches its maximum, at which R(t) =
˙ < 0 until I(t) → 0.

Solving this differential equation results in
1 − α − e−R0 α = 0 .

For α 6= 0 this equation has only a solution in terms of the Lambert W function. We
observe that α = α(R0 ), i.e. the quantity α is purely determined by the reproduction number.

If R0 > 2 then the result becomes imprecise and, therefore, requires either the inclusion
of higher order corrections in I/(R0 S(0)) or a numerical approach. This number of new
daily infections must be smaller than the capacity of the health care system. (Of course, this
capacity is non-trivial to estimate.)

2.2

Application to the Covid-19 pandemic

We apply the SIR-model to the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. The intention is merely to
illustrate the underlying dynamics rather than making any predictions. In the past months a
lot of effort has been put into mathematical modelling of the Covid-19 pandemic, see e.g. [15–
28] for an extensive, yet incomplete, list.

Figure 1: These plots show the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic for reproduction numbers
R0 ∈ {2.0; 3.0; 4.0}. The number of susceptible (blue), infectious (red) and recovered (green)
people is plotted against time (in days). It is emphasised that these plots are not suitable for
predictions. Instead they merely reveal the underlying dynamics of the SIR-model.

First of all, we notice that the SIR-model is approximately suitable to describe the Covid19 pandemic, because to present knowledge a recovered person is immune against reinfections
for some significant time at least.1 However, some infections lead to death. But technically,
dead people can be treated like recovered people in the SIR-model. Therefore, we do not need
to modify the model for the purpose of this note. In more realistic models of epidemiology
one should also include the status “exposed”, in which a person got infected without being
infectious yet. This is accounted for in the SEIR-model. Many more complications can be
introduced, such as asymptomatic cases etc., see e.g. [16] for a sophisticated model tailored
to describe Covid-19 pandemic.
In the SIR-model of Covid-19 we can set the recovery rate γ = 1/14 day−1 ' 0.071 day−1 ,
because typically it requires 14 days to recover from Covid-19.
Estimations of R0 range from 1.4 . R0 . 5.7, see [29–32] and references therein. A precise
value does not only depend on the virus itself but also on various external conditions such
as hygienic standards, people’s behaviour, density of population (see [33]), or possibly even
climate (see e.g. [34]). For the first two weeks of March we can estimate for Germany [35]:

' 4.7 .

(2.23)

Of course, this estimation is problematic, because neither the number of tests nor the number
of undetected cases is known (a transparent approach has been presented in [22]). Since
the testing has become more intense in this period, the above is likely to overestimate R0 .
Nevertheless our estimate is still consistent with the figures computed in [16].
In Figure 1 the underlying dynamics of the SIR-model is shown. The eqs. (2.2) to (2.4)
have been integrated numerically via the Euler method with initial conditions S(0) = 80 · 106 ,
I(0) = 114 and R(0) = 0. We observe that smaller R0 suppresses the peak Imax (see also
(2.18) for an analytical expression), and also shifts the time of herd immunity, tH , further into
the future. In particular, for a Covid-19 pandemic without any mitigation attempts we can
estimate 2 months . tH . 6 months. This estimation intends to give an idea about time scales
of a pandemic. Moreover, unsurprisingly, the plateau of the R-curve decreases for smaller R0 .
Using (2.15) we obtain α(2.0) ' 0.80, α(3.0) = 0.94 and α(4.0) = 0.98. Hence, without any
measures between 80%−98% of the population will have had contact with the virus at the end
of the pandemic. Note that those figures are not in contrast to the often quoted 60% − 70%
1

Once immunity gets lost the SIR-model can be easily extended to the SIRS-model (see e.g. [12]).

of infections. Those numbers refer to the moment of herd immunity. Indeed, from (2.10) we
get q(2.0) = 50%, q(3.0) = 67% and q(4.0) = 75%.
Furthermore we observe that even in the case of R0 = 2 more that 13% of the population
will be infectious at the peak of the pandemic. This is clearly unacceptable given the relatively
significant case fatality rates. The situation therefore triggered many ideas how to mitigate
worst case scenarios within this pandemic (see e.g. [1; 2; 17; 19; 33; 36–45]). Rather intuitive
strategies that had been suggested are the concepts of flattening the curve (Reff & 1) and
stopping the curve (Reff < 1).

2.3

Flattening the curve and fine-tuning in the Covid-19 pandemic

In this section we point out a problem with flattening the curve. The curve that needs
to be flattened is the I-curve, or, more strictly speaking, the rate of new infections curve,
I˙new (t) = βS(t)I(t). The latter curve will reach its peak before reaching herd immunity. This
curve must be flattened in a way such that the peak will be below some upper bound C due
to capacities of the health care system. It must be ensured that
I˙new (t) 6 C

at any time .

(2.24)

A simplified estimation of C may be as follows. Let nbed = 30 · 103 be the number of
available beds in intensive care units of hospitals to treat severe cases at an average duration
of ∆t = 10 days. The probability of any random infectious person to require intensive care is
assumed to be p = 5%. Then,
C∼

nbed
= 60 · 103 day−1 .
p∆t

(2.25)

This figure can only be seen as a very rough estimate, because each of its variables is just an
estimate. In addition, any constraint regarding health care staff or further necessary surgery
equipment has been ignored. Nevertheless, this number of C ∼ 60 · 103 day−1 suffices to point
out the problem with the concept of flattening the curve below C.
To see this we plot I˙new (t) for the parameter range Reff = 1.1 to 1.3. We use the notation
Reff instead of R0 because the rather small numbers are assumed to arise from some measures
(like social distancing). The plot can be easily obtained numerically by computing I(t + 1) −
I(t). The result is shown in Figure 2. We chose initial conditions as of 2020-05-03 without
aiming at guessing further unknown cases. The results shown are not meant to be a prediction
of the future.
We find that already the first decimal place of Reff has strong influence on the maximum
height of the curve I˙new (see (2.22) for an approximative formula). A jump from Reff from
1.1 to 1.3 suffices to increase the peak of daily new infections by a factor larger than 6. In
particular we see that Reff < 1.2 is needed to remain below the bound of 60 · 103 infections
per day. Therefore, the parameter range of the effective reproduction number in flattening
the curve is 1 < Reff < 1.2, and hence very tiny. We call this requirement fine-tuning. The
weaker the health care system the stronger the fine-tuning needs to be. Given the error bars
in measuring Reff (see [16]) it seems quite challenging to keep control of the pandemic within
this strategy. In particular, the precise impact of different measures on Reff is unknown at
present. Furthermore, the strategy flatten the curve seems to require a duration of larger
than one year! Consequently, flattening the curve seems not be the way to go in the Covid-19
pandemic.

2020-05-03 [35].

Figure 3: Illustration of the divide and conquer scenario. The whole population is initially
split into a high risk group (HRG) and a non-HRG. Infectious individuals are assumed to
exist only among the non-HRG, while the HRG is strictly isolated. As time evolves most of
the non-HRG become immune. The HRG is released from the isolation if Reff < 1 can be
ensured due to the large fraction of immune people.

3

The divide and conquer strategy

Since the measures against the Covid-19 pandemic particularly protect the high risk group
(HRG) the following divide and conquer strategy may appear worth considering: Only the
HRG is strictly isolated while no significant measures are imposed on the non-HRG. We
assume that infectious people only exist among the non-HRG. This situation is illustrated on
the left hand side of Figure 3. Due to the dynamics explained in Section 2 most of the initially
susceptible people become immune. If the proportion of immune people is large enough it is
conceivable that Reff < 1 even upon releasing the HRG from the isolation (depicted on the
right hand side of Figure 3).
One may hope that such a strategy can keep the economy alive without risking too many
human lives.
The question we want to answer is: If we isolate Q people (from N people in total) how
large can we make the fraction Q/N to ensure Reff < 1 after the isolation simply due to herd
immunity?

To answer this question we distinguish between two cases. In the first case, the dynamical
divide and conquer strategy, we assume that all infections occur merely due to the dynamics
of the SIR-model without any further intervention. In the second case, the divide and conquer
strategy with intentional infections, we admit interventions to maximise immunity.
In what follows we are ignorant about all practical problems with these strategies such as
strictly isolating millions of people for many months or even more. In this sense this discussion
remains rather academic.

3.1

Dynamical divide and conquer strategy

Since we isolate Q people initially, we have S(0) ' N − Q susceptible people left (assuming
I(0)  N ). The initial effective reproduction number corresponding to the left picture in
Figure 3 is

Now, one might suggest to isolate sufficiently many people to reach Reff,0 < 1 in the first place.
But then the isolation would have to last until effective vaccination is available. Therefore,
the divide and conquer strategy relies on herd immunity after releasing the Q people from
isolation.
If we wait long enough for the susceptible population to get infected and to recover, we
will have approximately
N − (N − Q)α(Reff,0 )
(3.2)
susceptible people on the right hand side of Figure 3. Recall that α(Reff,0 ) is a solution to
(2.15).
Hence, the new effective reproduction number becomes

which is reached for Reff,0 ' 2.15. The plot of (Q/N ) as a function of Reff,0 is shown in
Figure 4.
This result is a problem, because the HRG is certainly larger than 23%. For instance, the
fraction of people older than 60 years is in Germany above 25%, wo are included in the HRG
if we follow the definition of [9]. Note that in [8] and [10] people are counted to the HRG if
they are older than 65 and 70 years, respectively. However, also pregnant women, smokers,
chronically ill or obese people, etc. count to the HRG as well. An investigation into estimating
the size of the HRG in Germany is beyond the scope of this note, especially because a precise
definition of the criteria of the HRG is still under discussion among experts.
Another problem is the peak in the curve of new daily infections among the non-HRG.
At Reff,0 = 2.15 one obtains 9.51 · 105 infections per day (reached after 5 to 6 months from

the starting point of divide and conquer). Hence, even if the probability for an individual of
the non-HRG to require intensive treatment is ten times smaller than assumed in Section 2.3
the capacities of the health care system are exceeded. To avoid a collapse one rather needs
Reff,0 . 1.8 (leading to a maximum of 5.8 · 105 infections per day). This, however, reduces
the maximum of Q/N by only 1%. In general, from Figure 4 it becomes clear that the divide
and conquer strategy needs to accept large numbers of new daily infections (see also [1]).

3.2

Divide and conquer strategy with intentional infections

There is a loophole that invalidates (3.4) if we admit intentional infections. Thereby one could
artificially increase the number of immune people close to N − Q. Then,

Note that in this inequality R0 ' βN/γ is the basic reproduction number for the SARSCoV-2 virus without any particular measures. The result is not surprising given the formula

This may still turn out to be too small to accommodate the whole HRG among the isolated
people.
In any case, even if we assume that we could isolate 50% of the population (the HRG in
the first place), while we ensure that the other 50% become immune, we lower Reff down to
Reff ' R0 /2 ∼ 1.5 at the end of isolation. This is the rate at which the initially isolated people

will get infected. As demonstrated in Section 2.3 this implies a collapse of the health care
system, especially because the HRG is more likely to end up in an intensive care unit. Hence,
further restrictions would still be unavoidable. Therefore, the divide and conquer strategy
seems to provide no reasonable solution.

3.3

Equipartition strategy?

Finally we address some interesting effect that occurs upon dividing the population into n
equal, non-interacting, groups (see [17]).

Each group individually obeys the differential equations of the SIR-model:

We assume that only the recovery rate γ is equal among all groups.
Let us now assume an equipartition, i.e. Sk = S/n, Ik = I/n and Rk = R/n. The first
differential equation then becomes

and the overall transmission rate is reduced to β = βk /n relative to each group (this observation was made in [17] in a more general model). Unfortunately, this effect is undone in the
reproduction rates. We have

Since it is the reproduction number that determines the dynamics in the SIR-model, we cannot
gain any advantage of equipartition in the SIR-model. However, divide and conquer strategies
in this spirit may be interesting when taking into account diffusion terms (see e.g. [14]).

The importance of the reproduction number and the present
situation in Germany

So far it has become evident how essential the (effective) reproduction number is in order to
control a pandemic. The importance of this factor can be generalised to models beyond the
SIR-model, see e.g. [16] for an elaborate model in which R(t) is systematically determined.
We would like to summarise various arguments why Reff (and R0 in particular) is the
main parameter determining the next months (possibly more) of our lives:
1. The sign of the term Reff − 1 roughly distinguishes between exponential growth or
exponential decay of the number of active infections.
2. R0 determines the required fraction of the population to reach herd immunity.
3. R0 determines the fraction of people who eventually will have contact with the disease
if no mitigation measures are imposed.

4. Reff determines the number of daily new infections, see e.g. (2.12).
5. The strategy flattening the curve requires a fine-tuning of Reff with a precision of < 10%,
see Section 2.3. This is why this strategy is disfavoured in this note.
6. The duration τ of the strategy stop the curve can be estimated by the formula
τ∼

γ(1 − Reff )

(4.1)

at constant Reff < 1 with χ = χ(Reff ) being some number that quantifies how far we
are away from being able to track infection chains. At early stages of the pandemic χ
is somewhere between 1 < χ < 3, also depending on the effective reproduction number.
7. Taking into account diffusion effects one can show that for Reff > 1 the disease propagates at a speed of [13; 14]

(4.2)
Reff
A large reproduction number implies a large diffusion effect. For Reff < 1 dangerous
diffusion effects can be suppressed. Note that diffusion effects may easily trigger a second
wave after relaxation of lockdown measures.2
In the case of Germany we have 2, 8 · 104 known active infections as of 2020-05-03 [35].
If our goal is to reduce the number of new infections to a few hundred per day one obtains
χ ' 2 − 3 (as long as the reproduction number is not close to zero), assuming exponential
decay of the number of active infections. Keeping Reff < 1 we can therefore estimate the
duration of the lockdown to be
τ∼

2 weeks
· χ(Reff ) .
1 − Reff

(4.3)

Based on [16] a realistic estimate could be Reff ' 0.6 on average during the lockdown.
Then we obtain τ ∼ 12 weeks from now. If we were able to achieve and keep Reff ' 0.4 then
we need restrictions for τ ∼ 7 more weeks, and for Reff ' 0.2, in which χ ' 1.4 we even
have τ ∼ 3-4 weeks. Afterwards, when relaxing the restrictions, it will be crucial to track the
origins of every single new infection case, hoping that this tracking helps to keep Reff < 1
without further lockdowns. It is essential to be well prepared for this highly non-trivial task.
Finally we would like to stress that any strategy following Reff ' 1 will last for an extremely
long time as one can see from (4.3). This is why it is really important to keep the reproduction
number significantly below the critical value of 1 in the classical stop the curve strategy.

Conclusion

In this note we have demonstrated the basic mechanics of pandemics using the SIR-model.
Despite its simplicity it captures most of the relevant challenges we are facing in the Covid-19
pandemics. Therefore, we expect that most of the results are also implied by more sophisticated models.
In a short review of the SIR-model applied to the Covid-19 pandemics we have seen that the
strategy flattening the curve suffers from a necessary fine-tuning of the effective reproduction

number as well as a precise estimation of the capacity of health care systems. This strategy
is therefore risky and problematic.
In the main part of this note we approached a divide and conquer strategy. We concluded
that the idea to isolate just the high risk group instead of having collective lockdowns fails for
two reasons. First, the high risk group is most likely too large to develop herd immunity with
respect to the whole population. Second, despite exposing only rather young and healthy
people to the virus, the number of daily infections to be expected will probably still exceed
Germany’s health care system. Although the result on this strategy is negative, we find the
problem of quantifying this scenario interesting in itself, resulting in nice inequalities (3.4)
and (3.7) with useful applications in the development of new containment strategies.
Finally, we gave several reasons why the (effective) reproduction number is essential when
it comes to control the pandemic. Therefore, a monitoring of this parameter is and remains
necessary. This, in turn, requires systematic testing. In the case of Germany we estimated
that our present restrictions are presumably necessary for a few more months until we are in
the position to track the origins of individual infections. A precise exit strategy involves both
the size of the reproduction number and the number of new infections each day. The duration
until the exit can then be estimated by (4.3). This formula is not meant to be exact but it
provides a rough perspective for the next months. The more we can suppress the reproduction
number towards zero the earlier we may be able live with far less restrictions.
