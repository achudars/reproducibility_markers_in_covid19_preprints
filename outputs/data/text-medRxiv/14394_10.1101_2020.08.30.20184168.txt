Abstract
There is an emerging concern that the COVID-19 pandemic could harm psychological health and
exacerbate suicide risk. Utilising month-level suicide records covering the entire Japanese
population in 1,848 administrative units, we assessed whether suicide mortality changed during
the pandemic. Employing difference-in-difference estimation, we found that monthly suicide
rates declined by 14% during the initial five months (February to June 2020), which could be due
to a number of complex reasons, including the government’s generous subsidies, reduced
working hours, and school closure. In contrast, monthly suicide rates increased by 16% in the
second wave (July to October 2020), with the magnitude greater among females (37%) and
children and adolescents (49%). The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may remain,
while its modifiers (e.g. government subsidies) may not be sustained for long. Hence, effective
suicide prevention, particularly among vulnerable populations, should be an important public
health consideration.

Main
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of life. As the virus has spread globally1,
anxious individuals have voluntarily engaged in physical distancing and reduced their economic
activities to prevent infection. To contain the virus, governments have implemented large-scale
costly interventions in an unprecedented fashion: citizens and communities are requested to limit
social contacts, avoid social gatherings, close schools, and stop unnecessary business activities.
Thus far, most scientific and clinical attention has been given to identifying the disease’s direct
physical risk2,3 and its prevention4-6. However, the end of this pandemic is seemingly nowhere
near. This raises an emerging concern in a different public health arena: the pandemic could
adversely affect people’s mental health7,8 and, in a more pressing scenario, suicide fatalities could
increase9,10.
While suicide is rarely due to a single factor, and reasons for changes to suicide prevalence
are extremely complex, prior literature suggests that the pandemic may affect the suicide rate in
various ways. Together with fear, uneasiness, and anxiety caused by the threat of the disease,
social distancing can lead to impaired social and family relationships; increased loneliness,
boredom, and inactivity; and restricted access to healthcare services, potentially inducing mental
illness and elevated suicidal behaviours.10,11 Financial insecurity and loss of employment are wellknown risk factors for suicide12,13. Thus, the pandemic-driven economic recession could increase
potential suicidal deaths14. Not surprisingly, existing studies suggest that past epidemics such as
the Spanish Flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) led to increased suicide rates.15,16
At the same time, the current pandemic might have reduced some of the stress from workplaces
and social interactions (such as commuting, and school bullying), and government financial
support could have partially alleviated the pandemic’s adverse impacts. However, given the

unprecedented magnitude, ubiquity, and complexity of the ongoing public health crisis, adequate
preventive measures to reduce the risk of suicide will be required. To formulate effective policy
responses, policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers need a credible assessment of
suicide prevalence during this pandemic.
However, reliable empirical evidence regarding the link between the COVID-19 pandemic
and suicide mortality remains scarce. An inclusive assessment requires harmonised data that
cover representative and sufficiently large samples but are collected at a disaggregated level17,18.
Such data also should include information from both the pre-COVID-19 period (to serve as the
baseline samples) and the COVID-19 period. However, existing studies use readily available and
convenient data that could easily generate biased insights; many studies rely on some measures
of suicidality rather than suicide mortality19-24 and most of them compare suicidal behaviours
using snapshot data during the pandemic without pre-pandemic baseline samples19,20,22,23. Even
when studies use real suicide mortality, some rely on data that cover non-representative subsamples25-27, while others compare the whole suicide or suicidality trend before and during the
pandemic, which might capture common time trend, seasonality, or temporal time shocks across
individuals25-31 (we discuss why these time-series analysis and before-after comparison can be
problematic in the Method section).
In this study, we provide large-scale evidence linking the COVID-19 outbreak to suicide
fatalities using a city-by-month level dataset covering the entire Japanese population, more than
120 million people (Fig. 1; see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for the details
of data). Since the confirmation of the first case in Japan, the nation has been hit by two largescale COVID-19 outbreaks. In response, the national and local governments implemented various
preventive interventions, such as nationwide school closure and state of emergency, and local
business restrictions. Although the government concurrently provided generous financial

support for citizens and enterprises, accounting for as much as 10% of Japan’s annual GDP32,
people’s lives were still profoundly affected; for instance, the geographic mobility had dropped
below pre-pandemic level and the unemployment rate has increased for nine consecutive months
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 2). Since the Japanese suicide rate is the seventhhighest among high-income countries33 and has been among the top ten causes of death for the
last two decades,34 there have been rising concerns that the COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide
deaths.
Our data have some notable advantages for assessing whether suicide mortality changed
during the pandemic and the subsequent health interventions. First, our data cover both prepandemic and pandemic-era samples from November 2016 to October 2020, so that we can
investigate the relative change in suicide rate compared to the pre-pandemic baseline. (We
describe the suicide trend in Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2.) In particular, to construct a reliable
control condition (without pandemic), we employ a difference-in-differences (DID) estimation.
We assess whether suicide rates during the pandemic varied compared to the corresponding
seasons in the previous years, after controlling for the variation in the overall suicide level across
years (long-term suicide trend). Moreover, our data are collected from 1,848 administrative units,
which enables us to control for various confounding factors. Specifically, our regression includes
two sets of high-dimensional fixed effects: a city-by-month fixed effects control for month-specific
shocks in each city (e.g. seasonality in suicide rate, monthly local events, or climatic conditions),
and a city-by-year fixed effects control for a year-specific shock in each city (e.g. macroeconomic
trend, industrial or population structural changes, or suicide trends). (We describe details in the
Methods section.)
The effects of the pandemic might not be evenly distributed across populations. To identify
the vulnerable populations, we further analyse heterogeneous impacts across gender and age

groups. Historically, male adults have faced the highest suicide risk in Japan. During the prepandemic period in our dataset, the male suicide rate is about 2.3 times as high as that of females
(per-month suicide rate is 18.1 per million for males and 7.8 per million for females from
November 2016 to January 2020, see Supplementary Table 1), and is even higher among male
adults (21.8 per million among males aged 20-69). Because previous literature suggests financial
and economic distress could trigger suicide fatalities particularly among males35, and the COVID19 pandemic brought about non-negligible disruptions in the labour market, we might expect its
adverse impact to be greater among such populations. (We summarise the suicide trends in Japan
in Supplementary Note 3.) Alternatively, older adults face a heightened risk of infection and
death from COVID-192,3, which could amplify their fear and distress about virus transmission.
Additionally, existing studies suggest that, unlike normal economic recessions, this pandemic has
gendered impacts: social distancing disproportionately affects female-dominant employment36,
and stay-home orders increase household tasks, and even domestic violence, which could
disproportionately impair well-being among females37. These suggest that the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic could be intensified among these previously lower-risk populations.
Two analyses complement our empirical analyses. First, we investigate whether the impacts
vary across job status, which can indicate through which channels the pandemic and health
interventions can affect suicide mortality. For instance, we might expect the government
subsidies to mitigate the adverse impacts differently across individuals (such as employed,
retired, and unemployed) and firm owners (self-employed). Further, household dynamics
(increase in housework, domestic violence) might disproportionately affect housewives’
psychological health, and unusual school calendars (nationwide school closure, and the
reductions in outdoor activities and social connections) might affect students’ mental well-being.
Lastly, we assess whether the effect of the pandemic varied across different types of cities using

the dimensions of original suicide risks, pandemic associated risks (COVID-19 prevalence, health
interventions, and economic downturns), and base socio-economic status (income and urban
populations). For example, we investigate whether the suicide trend varied between cities with
high and low per-capita income.

Results
Main Results
The suicide rate substantially declined during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
(February to June 2020), but rapidly increased during the second outbreak (July to October 2020)
(Fig. 2a). The DID estimates during the first outbreak, adjusting for permanent unobserved cityby-year and city-by-month determinants of the suicide rate, show that the overall suicide rate
declined by 14% (incidence rate-ratios [IRR]: 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82 to 0.90)
compared to the same season in previous years. In contrast, it increased by 16% (IRR: 1.16, 95%
CI: 1.11 to 1.21) amid the second outbreak (Fig. 2a). During the second wave, an increasing suicide
trend has been apparent, and the suicide rate increased by 38% in October 2020 (IRR: 1.38, 95%
CI: 1.27 to 1.49; the full results are in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).
Using the event-study approach, from estimated coefficients, we confirm that the assumption
for parallel trends is not violated during the pre-treatment period, as average suicide rates in
2016-2019 and 2020 are not different (Fig. 2: k <= -1) (Supplementary Table 4). These results are
robust to the inclusion of the time-varying weather variables and prefecture-specific quadratic
time trends (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Moreover, the adoption of the OLS model, instead of the
Poisson model, does not affect our main findings (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
To ascertain that the results are not driven by either the common time trends or common yearspecific shocks across cities or regions, we conduct a placebo test. Extended Data Fig. 3a shows

that when using the placebo samples, the estimated coefficients are close to zero, and our real
estimate for the first outbreak is much smaller than the lower bound of the coefficients’ 95% CI
(IRR: 0.96 to 1.04), while the estimate for the second outbreak is much larger than the upper bound
of the coefficients’ 95% CI (IRR: 0.96 to 1.04). This analysis suggests that our results are not driven
by a spurious correlation. These patterns hold when we conduct the event-study regression
analogously using the placebo samples, validating the strong relationship between the pandemic
and the suicide rate. (Extended Data Fig. 3b)
On average, 1,596 individuals died by suicide in each month during our study period
(November 2016-October 2020). Our back-of-the-envelope calculation finds that there were 1,074
averted suicide deaths during the initial outbreak (95% CI: 830 to 1,488) from February to June
2020 but there were 970 additional suicide deaths during the subsequent outbreak (95% CI: 630
to 1,170) from July to October 2020 (Extended Data Fig. 4). In the corresponding period, the
number of direct deaths from COVID-19 was 1,765 (as of October 31), suggesting that the
magnitude of the suicidal effects is not negligible.

Heterogeneity Across Gender and Age Groups
We investigate the heterogeneous impacts of the pandemic across gender, age groups, and
periods. We find some noteworthy variation in the magnitude of the pandemic effects (full results
in Supplementary Table 5).
First, during the nationwide state of emergency, suicide reduction among adults (individuals
aged 20-69 years) was particularly salient (Fig. 3a). In the middle of the first wave, to slow down
viral transmission, the national government declared a state of emergency, where individuals
were requested to stop unnecessary business, reduce social contacts, and stay home if possible.
During this period, suicide deaths among adults declined by about 21~27% (Fig. 3a, male adults,

IRR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.85; female adults, IRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.83), and this is about
twice as much as the decline during other periods in the first wave. In contrast, the reduction in
the suicide rate among the individuals aged 70 and over was not remarkably larger during the
state of emergency (Figs. 3a and 3b).
Second, the increase in suicide fatalities in the second wave is primarily driven by females and
children and adolescents (individuals aged below 20 years) (Figs. 2 and 3). Suicide mortality
increased by 37% among females (Fig. 2c, IRR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.49), and this is about 5 times
greater than males (Fig. 2b, IRR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.14). In October 2020, its increase was
particularly substantial; we observe that suicide rate among females increased by 82%
(Supplementary Table 3, IRR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.62-2.04). The suicide rate among children and
adolescents was also heightened in the second wave, which mostly corresponds to the period
after the end of the nationwide school closure (Fig. 2d, IRR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.98).

Heterogeneity Across Job Status
The suicide rate decreased among those employed, retired, and unemployed in the first wave

of the epidemic, but mostly increased in the second wave (Fig. 4a-Fig. 4c). These patterns are
identical to the population as a whole. In contrast, we observe some dissimilar suicide trends
among specific sub-populations.
We find that the suicide rate among the self-employed did not decline in either the first or
second wave (Fig. 4d). In contrast, suicides among housewives (defined as adult women who are
married and not employed in wage labour) increased during all pandemic periods (Fig. 4e). In
particular, from July to October 2020, the rate rose by 132% (IRR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.65 to 3.26). We
also find that suicide deaths by students declined by about 49% during the school closure (Fig.
4f, IRR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.77) (full results in Supplementary Table 6). The results for students

are slightly different than those for children and adolescents. We describe these data in
Supplementary Note 1.

Heterogeneity Across Cities
In Fig. 5, we investigate whether the effect of the pandemic varied across different types of

cities (full results in Supplementary Table 7). First, we compare cities with higher suicide risks (if
the suicide rate before the pandemic is high, the city is classified as a high-suicide-risk city) with
cities with lower suicide risks (Fig. 5a). We might expect suicide effects during the pandemic to
be intensified in the high-risk cities. However, the results show the opposite; only cities which
previously had low suicide rates saw an increase during the pandemic.
We also investigated heterogeneity with respect to disease associated risks. We used COVID19 prevalence (measured by total confirmed cases per million population in October 2020) and
find the effects do not vary across cities regarding the dimensions (Fig 5b). We also utilised
variation in intensity of the health intervention (Extended Data Fig. 5a: measured by Google
mobility change at workplaces from January 2020 to after February 2020), and economic shocks
(Extended Data Fig. 5b: measured by the changes in unemployment from October-December 2019
to April-September 2020), and did not find notable disparities in the impact. Note that, because
these data are available at prefectural level, but not at city level, these results should be
interpreted with caution.
Lastly, we find the effects are not heterogeneous in terms of the base socio-economic status,
such as income per capita (Fig 5c: measured in 2018) and urban population (Extended Data Fig.
5c: measured in 2018).

Discussion
Utilising high-frequency data that cover the entire Japanese population, we investigate
whether suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. In the Methods section, we argue that
the use of time-series analysis25-27,29-31,38 and simple before-after comparison26,27,29,30,38 could easily
generate biased estimates. Instead, we use a DID model with high-dimensional fixed effects that
allow us to control for a number of potential confounders. Consistent with emerging concerns,
we find that suicide deaths increased from July to October 2020 (IRR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.21),
although the effects appeared several months after the pandemic started. Notably, an increasing
suicide trend has been apparent during this period.
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of life. In Japan, the unemployment rate
has increased for nine consecutive months since the epidemic was recognised (Supplementary
Fig. 1c). Social interactions and mobility also have been substantially restricted by individual
choice or by government intervention (see mobility index in Supplementary Fig. 1d). Fear and
anxiety regarding infection are persistent. Given these circumstances, while the reasons behind
suicide are extremely complex, there are a number of factors that could explain the rapid increase
in the suicide rate during the second COVID-19 outbreak.
We find that the effects of the pandemic are not evenly distributed across populations.
Compared to the historical suicide pattern, we find that this time is different. First, the previous
suicide rate among males was 2.3 times higher than that among females (from November 2016 to
January 2020, see Supplementary Table 1), and the suicide increase among males after earlier
financial crises was larger than that among females39. In contrast, during the second wave of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in the suicide rate among females (IRR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26 to
1.49) was about five times greater than that among males (IRR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.13), and that

11

among housewives was even more so (IRR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.65 to 3.26). (The suicide level among
males remained higher, but disparities decreased.) These results are consistent with recent studies
that find that this crisis unevenly affects female-dominant industries36, and stay-home orders
magnify the working mother’s burden40. When we look at the Japanese labour market, we also
find similar patterns: the decrease in female employment is more pronounced than in male
employment (Fig. 6a), and non-regular workers (56% of females and 22% of males are non-regular
workers) are unevenly affected during this pandemic (Fig. 6b). In addition, domestic violence,
mostly harming women (more than 95% of all cases), increased (Fig. 6c, see Supplementary Note
1 for data). All of this could have harmed women’s psychological health.
The suicide rate among children and adolescents also increased in the second wave of the
pandemic (IRR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.98). This may be because the pandemic also excessively
affects younger workers, who are more likely to be low-skilled, and employed on less secure work
contracts. In fact, the decline in the employment rate during the disease outbreak is greater among
those generations. Furthermore, the second outbreak corresponds to the period when schools
(elementary to high school) were reopened after the nationwide school closure. Previous work
reports that schooling could be a risk factor for violence41 and suicide42 among students. After a
few months of life without any school activities during the pandemic, the stress from returning
to school could have been exacerbated. These factors might have amplified children’s and
adolescents’ psychological depression.
Immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak (February to June 2020), however, we find a notable
reduction in suicide rates (IRR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.90). The finding might have been
unexpected, yet is consistent with the emerging studies and statistics which find that suicide
deaths decreased in Norway30, the UK43, Germany27 and Peru44, and did not change in Greece31,
Massachusetts (US)25, Victoria (Australia)45, and China (outside Wuhan)46 (Suicide deaths in Nepal

increased29), when these countries were placed under strict lockdowns. Also, existing studies
often report a drop followed by a delayed increase in suicide rates after national disasters,
including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the 9/11 terrorist attack in 2001. (The initial decline is
called the pulling-together effect or honeymoon effect47-49; see Supplementary Note 4.) Hence,
suicide decline in the initial phase of this public health crisis may not be surprising.
In Japanese contexts, several additional mechanisms could explain this decline in the initial
stage. In response to the crisis, the national government provided several subsidies and benefits
to citizens and enterprises (Supplementary Note 1 and 2), which might have reduced economic
distress. We observe that about 80% of the cash benefits was distributed to citizens before June
(all citizens were eligible to receive cash benefits of 100,000 yen ≈ 940 USD), and suicide among
individuals (employed, unemployed, and retired) decreased only before June (Fig. 4a-c).
Additionally, claims for business subsidies grew rapidly after May until October, and the number
of bankruptcies remained lower than the pre-pandemic level (Fig. 6e). The suicide rate among the
self-employed did not increase during the periods.
We also see that working hours for both full-time and part-time workers declined
substantially (10%~20%) from April to May (Fig. 6f). Overwork and commuting are wellrecognised risk factors for suicide, particularly among the working population in Japan 50; hence,
reduced working hours and work-from-home policies could have improved people’s
productivity, life satisfaction and mental health51-53. This explanation is consistent with our
finding of the largest decline in suicide rates among adults during the state of emergency (male
adult, IRR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.85, female adult, IRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.83), which mainly
comprise the working population.
Finally, school closure may have reduced psychological burdens on children and adolescents,
which could have resulted in suicide prevention. We have found that the suicide rate declined

substantially among students during the nationwide school closure, March and April 2020 (IRR:
0.51, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.77).
Our results offer a number of important insights on suicide mortality during the pandemic
that might remain relevant even after normal life resumes. First and foremost, the suicide trend
in Japan could remain escalated in the long term. In the absence of effective pharmaceutical
interventions (e.g. a vaccine or antiviral treatments), pandemic-related suicidal risk factors (e.g.
disease recurrence, social distancing, and economic downturns) would remain. While we have
argued that massive government subsidies and benefits might have might have contributed to
the prevention of suicides in the beginning of the epidemic, such generous financial support
might not be sustainable for long. Hence, society has to monitor the overall suicide trends, so that
it can immediately consider to take policy responses.
In addition, our results suggest that, to formulate effective prevention strategies amid the
COVID-19 pandemic, customised approaches, rather than conventional ones, are needed. We
have found that, unlike normal economic circumstances, this pandemic disproportionately affects
the psychological health of children and adolescents, and females (especially housewives).
Additionally, we find that only cities which previously had low suicide rates saw an increase
suicide in deaths during the pandemic. Therefore, the prevention strategy might need to target
these vulnerable populations and locations.
Our results could also suggest directions to prevent suicide even after normal life resumes.
We argued that reduced working hours might have contributed to a reduction of suicide among
adults during the state of emergency (April to May), and school closure might have had a
protective role among students. These highlight the need to identify the exact factors associated
with workplaces and school sessions which could affect the psychological well-being of workingpopulations and students.

We conclude by discussing the limitations of our study. First, while we have proposed
potential mechanisms for the linkage between the pandemic and suicides, it is challenging to
disentangle the contributions of each factor. To do so, one needs variation in the timing and
intensity of each contributor (e.g. disease prevalence, government interventions, economic shocks,
financial support, and working conditions). However, the COVID-19 pandemic affects almost
every community and citizen concurrently, and our analyses could not fully utilise such variation.
Moreover, we could not investigate the effect among specific subgroups of interest. For
example, mental health consequences among healthcare professionals have been of great concern
as they are taking on extraordinary burdens during the pandemic 54,55. Similarly, suicide effects
among those with a high risk of case fatalities (those with the presence of comorbidities) 2,3,
financial strain (low-skilled or low-income workers)36, or social isolation (including those who
need mental health care or those with cognitive disorders) should be carefully monitored.
Additionally, suicide data may not be precise during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible
that some suicide deaths were not found, or were reported after delays. Also, suicide might have
been misclassified as a different cause of death because the pandemic could have disrupted the
reporting process. If any of these is the case, our estimates could be understated.
Finally, we want to emphasise that the results of our study may not apply to other
communities or countries because our study is founded on the unique Japanese public health,
economic, cultural, and social contexts. Particularly, during our study period, the confirmed
COVID-19 cases per population in Japan were only 2.9% of those in the US and 12.7% of those in
Germany (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Moreover, the Japanese government’s health intervention is
among the most lenient, based on “request” rather than “enforcement,” ensuring a high degree
of individual freedom (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Nevertheless, the national government provided
very generous fiscal support for households and enterprises, accounting for 10% of the annual

GDP (Supplementary Fig. 3c). These together could make a difference in the extent of the
epidemic’s impact on mental well-being. Therefore, to protect global psychological health by
preventing escalated suicide rates, continuous assessment of the effect of the pandemic in each
society is crucial.

Methods
Data
We use city-by-month data on suicide records from November 2016 to October 2020, covering
all the suicide deaths among a total of 126 million citizens in Japan. The data are derived from
suicide statistics published by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, and they include
information such as the number of suicides by age, gender, employment status, site, and day of
the week56,57. The dataset includes 76,626 (monthly average 1,596) suicides in 1,848 cities (N =
88,512) with the average monthly suicide rate at 12.8 per million population. Males account for
68.2% of total suicides, and, in particular, male adults (between 20 and 69 years) contribute to
about half of this total (50.2%) (Supplementary Table 1). Using these data, we assess how suicide
rates vary before and during the pandemic.
We also use other datasets to supplement our analysis, including the number of COVID-19
infections, weather conditions, and macroeconomic conditions (i.e., bankruptcy, unemployment
rates, consumption index, and diffusion index). Details for these data are available in
Supplementary Note 1.

Difference-in-Differences model
A central empirical challenge to estimating the effect of COVID-19 on suicide rates is to
disentangle the effect of the pandemic from the long-term suicide trend and its seasonality. On
average, the suicide rate has declined by 6.4% from 2017 to 2019 (Extended Data Fig. 2; if data are
extended, it declined by about 25% from 2013 to 2019). In addition, before the pandemic, the
average suicide rate in February is 5.1% higher than that in January. These imply that study
design based on the before-after comparison could be problematic; if it compares the suicide
levels before and during the COVID-19 outbreak29 (such as interrupted time-series analysis or

regression discontinuity design), the estimates might capture the seasonal trend (particularly
between January and February); alternatively, if it compares the suicide level relative to past years
in the same season26,27,30,38, the estimate might be confounded by a long-term ascending or
descending suicide trend. (In Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4, we discuss why
interrupted time-series analysis is problematic in our research context.)
The suicide trend and its seasonality also have to be accounted for at a disaggregated level,
because they vary widely across locations (Extended Data Fig. 2). For instance, most regions had
a declining suicide trend (Extended Data Fig. 2b1, and c1), although it increased in some regions
(Extended Data Fig. 2d1). Relatedly, we observe that the suicide rate in summer is higher in some
locations (Extended Data Fig. 2b2), while that pattern is reversed in others (Extended Data Fig.
2e2). If we eliminate such location-specific trends and seasonality (we regress suicide rate on cityby-month, and city-by-year fixed effects, and eliminate those effects), suicide patterns seem to be
different from the observed trends (Extended Data Fig. 2a3~e3). These make the point that the
time-series analysis, which compares national suicide trends, could easily generate biased
estimates25-27,29-31,38. Instead, accurate estimation requires a quasi-experimental research design and
harmonised data, by defining reasonable location-specific control conditions (counterfactual
without the pandemic).
By leveraging our disaggregated but comprehensive dataset, we adopt the Difference-inDifferences (DID) estimation with high-dimensional fixed effects. Our model is designed to
overcome the empirical challenges. First, the model compared the difference in suicide rates
before (November to January) and during the virus outbreaks (February to October) with the
difference in the corresponding period in the previous three years (November 2016 to October
2019). Because the model focuses on the relative difference before and during the sudden
pandemic within a year, the overall suicide level across years (long-term suicide trend) will be

cancelled out. Second, we include city-by-month fixed effect and city-by-year fixed effect. These
rich sets of fixed effects allow us to isolate the pandemic effects from the location-specific suicide
trend and seasonality.
In particular, we specify the following model;
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = 𝛼𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑚 + 𝜇𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 + 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(1)

where Y denotes suicide rates in city i in month m in year y (a year includes 12 months from
November to October), and 𝛼 is the parameter of interest, which denotes the impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates. 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑚 is a binary variable that takes 1 if periods of
observations corresponded to months between February (when the COVID-19 outbreak became
salient and the national government launched the nationwide anti-contagion policies) and
October. It takes 0 if periods correspond to months from November to January regarded as the
“pre-treatment” period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 takes 1 if the year is 2020
(November 2019 to October 2020) and 0 otherwise (November 2016 to October 2019). In this model,
suicide trends between February and October from 2016 to 2019 serve as a control condition
(counterfactual), after accounting for the level across years, with the assumption that we
encounter only common shocks between the control and the treatment periods (during the
pandemic).
We include city-by-month fixed effect and city-by-year fixed effect denoted by 𝜇𝑖𝑚 and 𝛾𝑖𝑦 .
The former flexibly controls for month-specific shocks in each city, such as seasonality in the
suicide rate, monthly local events, or climatic conditions58,59. The latter controls for year-specific
shocks in each city, such as macroeconomic trends, industrial or population structural changes,
or suicide trends.
Suicide trends during the pandemic could vary across periods depending on the size of the
ongoing outbreak, people’s response, and the government’s health interventions. Specifically,

Japan faced two large COVID-19 outbreaks (Supplementary Note 2), and we might expect the
suicide trend to vary in each wave. Therefore, we estimate:
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = 𝛼𝑓 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 + 𝛼𝑠 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 + 𝜇𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 + 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(2)

where 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 denotes the dummy variable, which takes 1 during months corresponding to the
first outbreak (February to June), and 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 takes 1 during months corresponding to the
second outbreak (July to October). Similarly, we estimate how the suicide trends differ during
the state of emergency (April and May 2020), and the school closure (March and April 2020).
Our outcome variables of interest, suicide rate, is left-skewed and non-negative. Specifically,
58.7% of the city-by-month suicide rate takes zero during our study period. Therefore, we use a
Poisson-pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimator to specify the equations (1) and (2)60,61.
The adjusted model for equation (2) can be written as:
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = exp[ 𝛼𝑓 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 + 𝛼𝑠 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 + 𝜇𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 ] ∗ 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚 .

(3)

We use a package “ppmlhdfe” to estimate the regression, with options “weight”, “absorb” and
“cluster” in STATA version 16 to implement all the Poisson regression analyses60. We report the
estimated coefficient in the form of incidence rate-ratios (IRR). For this estimation, the necessary
condition for the existence of the estimates is non-existence of the “separated” observations 61.
Therefore, such observations are dropped in the procedure. Note that because more than 95% of
city-by-month suicide rate among children and adolescents takes zero, we aggregate the data to
the prefectural level for this specific cohort.
We cluster standard errors at the city level to allow arbitrary correlation over time within the
same city. Additionally, all the regressions are weighted by population in 2018 so that cities with
larger populations are given greater weights. Intuitively, these weights help to estimate the
impact of the event on an average person instead of on an average city.

Event-study Approach
The assumption for the DID estimator to be valid is that the pandemic period (February to
October) in 2020 and the same periods in 2016-2019 would have parallel trends in suicide rates in
the absence of the pandemic. If this assumption were not satisfied, the estimated parameter would
be biased because the results could be driven by systematic differences between the treatment
and control groups rather than the event of interest. To assess whether the parallel trends
assumption would be reasonable, we adopt the event study approach by fitting the following
equation37,62:
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = exp[ ∑5𝑘=−6,𝑘≠−1 𝛼𝑘 (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑚,𝑘 ) + 𝜇𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 ] ∗ 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(4)

where 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑚 takes 1 if the month corresponds to 𝑘, where 𝑘 = −1 is set to be a month before
the pandemic period (January). Intuitively, this casts the difference in suicide rates between 2020
season and 2016-2019 season in each month relative to 𝑘 = −1: we expect the treatment group
and control group to have a similar suicide rate before the disease outbreak becomes salient (𝑘 <
0), while we expect it to diverge after the outbreak (𝑘 ≥ 0).

Heterogeneity
We estimate the heterogeneity impacts across different gender, age, job status, and geography.
For age and gender, we re-estimate equation (3) by using suicide rate across gender and age
groups (children and adolescents aged below 20 years, the working-age population aged 20-69
years, and older adults aged 70 years or over). For job status, we use suicide rate among employed,
retired, unemployed, self-employed, housewife, and student.
For heterogeneous analysis across geography, we re-estimate equation (3) using the
subsamples. We use city-level base suicide rate (measured from November 2016 to January 2020),
base income per capita (measured in 2018), and base share of urban population (measured in

21

2018) to classify the samples, in that, if the variable in a city is above its median, the corresponding
city is classified as a high-group. Similarly, we use the prefectural level COVID-19 prevalence
(measured by total confirmed cases per million population in October2020), mobility restrictions
(measured by Google mobility change at workplaces from January 2020 to after February 2020),
and economic shocks (measured by the changes in unemployment from October-December 2019
to April-September 2020). We use prefectural level data for the sample classifications because the
city-level data are not available. The details of these data are described in Supplementary Note 1.

Placebo test
We perform a placebo test37,63 to ascertain that impacts of the pandemic on suicide rates are
not driven by either common time trends or common shocks across different periods, using the
following procedure. Using the data from November 2016 to October 2019, we randomly allocate
treatment status to a year in the same period (February to June for the first outbreak, and July to
October for the second outbreak) in each city and estimate the treatment effects analogously to
equations (3) and (4). These equations can be written as:
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = exp[ 𝛼𝑓𝑝 ∗ 𝑃𝑙_𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 + 𝛼𝑠𝑝 ∗ 𝑃𝑙_𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 + 𝜇𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 ] ∗ 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = exp[ ∑5𝑘=−6,𝑘≠−1 𝛼𝑘𝑝 (𝑃𝑙_𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑚,𝑘 ) + 𝜇𝑖𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 ] ∗ 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(5)

(6)

where 𝑃𝑙_𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 takes 1 if the treatment status is allocated in both the equations. Then, we
compare the placebo results to the real estimates. We repeat these procedures 1,000 times. If there
is an event causing higher suicide incidence in a specific region in a pre-pandemic period (e.g.
cities in Tokyo prefecture in 2019 have unusually high suicide rates), our placebo results would
include the spike in the estimated parameters. These results might imply that our main estimate
is not driven by the disease outbreak, but by a random shock (or time trend) in some cities. We
expect the placebo results (denoted by 𝛼𝑓𝑝 , 𝛼𝑠𝑝 , and 𝛼𝑘𝑝 ) not to be statistically different from zero.

Back-of-the-envelope calculation
To estimate the increased or decreased deaths from suicide during the pandemic, we estimate
the following equation:
̂
𝑆𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒
𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡,𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 = (𝛼
̂𝑓 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 + 𝛼
̂𝑠 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 ) ∗
𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑖,𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡,𝑝𝑟𝑒

(7)

̂
where 𝑆𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒
𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡,𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 denotes the predicted suicide change in city i in treatment year
(the year 2020) during the pandemic period (after February). This is computed by estimated
coefficients ( 𝛼
̂𝑓 and 𝛼
̂𝑠 ) derived by specifying equation (3) for the period during the first
outbreak (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 , 5 months) and second outbreak (𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑦 ∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 , 4 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑠 ), and
number of base suicide deaths (𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑖,𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡,𝑝𝑟𝑒 ). We then sum the changes in suicides in
each city to compute change on the national scale.

Fig. 2. The effects of COVID-19 pandemic on suicide across gender and age groups using DID and
event-study approaches: Panel a describes the results of the event study using all the pooled samples.
Panels b and c show the results using suicide rates among males and females. Panels d, e, and f
present the results on different age groups. In all graphs, the lines represent the point estimates
coloured by grey before the pandemic, by blue during the first outbreak of the COVID-19, and by red
during the second outbreak, with shaded areas showing the 95% confidence interval. The blue and
red circle and line denote the DID result and its 95% confidence interval during the first and second

Fig. 3. Heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among age groups and gender, before and
after the stage of emergency, and the school closure: Here, we assign April and May as the period of
the state of emergency (SOE), February-June as the first outbreak period, and July-October as the
second outbreak period. Baseline is a result when all samples are pooled. The circle and line denote
the DID result and its 95% confidence interval in each period, respectively. Panel a represents the
heterogeneous effects among age groups and gender during the state of emergency (SOE). Panels b
and c describe heterogeneity across age and gender groups during the first outbreak (except for SOE)
and second outbreak, respectively. Panel d shows the effects on students during the school closure
(March and April) and other periods. The full results are represented in Supplementary Table 5. All
regressions include city-by-year fixed effects and city-by-month fixed effects and are weighted by the
population, and standard errors are clustered at the city level. N= 61,209 (all), 47,317 (male adults),
26,319 (female adults), 24,478 (male elderly), 16,531 (female elderly), and 1,896 (children and

Fig. 4 Heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among job status: This graph describes the
results of the effects of the pandemic on suicide across those with different job status during the first
and second outbreaks of COVID-19, and during school closure for students. The blue and red circle
and line denote the DID result and its 95% confidence interval during the first and second outbreaks,
respectively. For each panel, we use different outcomes. We use the number of the suicide rate among
those whose jobs are classified as either employed (panel a), retired (b), unemployed (c), selfemployed(d), housewife (e), or student (f). The full results are represented in Supplementary Table 6.
All regressions include city-by-year fixed effects and city-by-month fixed effects and are weighted by

Extended Data Fig. 2. The trend and seasonality of suicide across regions: Panels a1-e1 show the
observed suicide rate in each prefecture. Panels a2-e2 represent the seasonal suicide trend before the
pandemic (Feb 2017- Jan 2020, three years) and during the pandemic. Panels a3-e3 describe the suicide
trends after eliminating the effects of suicide trend and seasonality. To do so, we regress suicide rate
on city-by-month fixed effects, and city-specific suicide linear time trends, and eliminate these effects.
Panel a uses all observations (1,848 cities), Panel b uses the cities in Hokkaido prefecture (177 cities),
Panel c uses Tokyo prefecture (57 cities), Panel d uses Nara prefecture (39 cities), and Panel e uses
Fukuoka prefecture (73 cities).

Extended Data Fig. 3. Robustness check: Panel a represents the results of the placebo test. Using
samples from 2016 to 2019, we first randomly allocate treatment dummies within the city across the
years. We then regress the suicide rate on the placebo treatment 1,000 times. The mean effect using the
placebo sample is around zero, and the estimate of the first outbreak is much smaller than 95% CI of
the placebo results and that of second outbreak is much larger than 95% CI of the placebo results.
Panel b repeats event study regression using the placebo samples analogously. The estimated
coefficient is close to zero in all periods. All regressions include city-by-year fixed effects and city-bymonth fixed effects and are weighted by population, and standard errors are clustered at the city level.
N= 61,209 (b). Each regression for 1,000 times has different number of observations (a). The separated

Panel a describes the predicted change in suicide rate with COVID-19 and otherwise. The difference
between the grey line (without COVID-19) and the blue line (with COVID-19) represents the effects
of the pandemic. Panel b demonstrates the predicted increased or decreased deaths by suicide across
periods. The blue dashed line represents the points estimate, while the light blue area shows the 95%

Extended Data Fig. 5. Additional analyses on heterogenous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
across geography: This graph describes the results of the effects of the pandemic on suicide during
the first and second outbreaks across locations with different prefecture-level intensity of health
interventions (panel a), prefecture-level economic shock (b), and base share of urban population
(c). The intensity of health intervention is measured by the level of decline in the Google mobility
index, and economic shock by the changes in unemployment rate. If the variable in a prefecture or
city is lower than the median, the prefecture or city is defined as “low”. All regressions include cityby-year fixed effects and city-by-month fixed effects and are weighted by population, and standard
errors are clustered at the city level. N= 23,530 (a, low), 37,679 (a, high), 26,004 (b, low), 35,205 (b, high),

Supplementary Notes
Supplementary Note 1. Data sources and description
Map data of Japan (Fig. 1): The shape file of Japan is obtained from the web page of ESRI Japan inc. 1
The maps are created by authors.
COVID-19 cases in Japan (Fig. 1b): The data are obtained from the web page of the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan 2. The data include confirmed cases, deaths, and
recovered at the prefectural level (47 prefectures in Japan).
Suicide rate among children and adolescents, and students (Fig. 3d and Fig. 4f): We obtain the suicide
rate across job status from the same sources as the main analyses3. We distinguish children
and adolescents (individuals aged below 20), and students because some students are older
than 20 years old, and some children and adolescents could be employed full-time. In 2019,
the number of suicide deaths among children and adolescents was 659, while that among
students was 856. These might generate some difference in the results.
Suicide rate across job status (Fig 4): We obtain the suicide rate across job status from the same
sources as the main analyses3. The results of this analyses should be interpreted with caution
because job status may not be based on the information from the subjects who committed
suicide. Second, to protect privacy, the cities with one or two suicide deaths (in each month)
are dropped from the observations. As a result, 5.2% of the populations are dropped. Note
that, because these data are collected at more aggregated level, observations are reduced from
1,848 cities to 791 cities (some cities are counted as a greater city area as a whole).
Municipality-level socioeconomic status (Figs. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 5c): We use income and urban
population to investigate whether the effects vary across different type of cities. We obtained
these data from the “Statistical Observations of Municipalities”, published by the Ministry of

Employment and unemployment rate (Figs. 6 a and b, Supplementary Fig. 1c, and Extended Data Fig. 5b):
The data are obtained from the Labour Force Survey from the Statistic Bureau of Japan, which
is provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 5.
Domestic violence help calls (Fig. 6c): The data are obtained from the Gender Equality Bureau
Cabinet Office. The data described are published by the 2 nd research meetings held by the

Household income (Fig. 6d): The data are derived from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey.
The survey is conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIAC) 7,
and the data include detailed information about household income, expenditure, and
ownership of different facilities and appliances. We use total income after excluding bonus
payment for our analyses.
Unconditional cash transfers (Fig. 6d): The data are derived from the MIAC8. All Japanese citizens
received cash benefits at 100,000 yen (940USD) in response to the pandemic. Note that before
5 June, 2020, 30.2% of the cash benefits were distributed and the starting date is not available.
We assume that it took 2 weeks to distribute the benefits in Fig. 6d.
Number of Bankruptcies (Fig. 6e): We obtain the data from Nationwide Business Failures from
Tokyo Shoko Research9.
Claims for business subsidy (Fig. 6e): We derive the data from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and

population. Using these two variables, we create confirmed cases per population in each
country.
Stringency Index (Supplementary Fig. 3b): The data are obtained from the Coronavirus Government
Response Tracker, provided by the University of Oxford 16. We use the variable “Stringency
Index” that reflects seven policy responses, including school closing, workplace closing,
cancel public events, restrictions on gatherings, close public transport, stay at home
requirements, and restrictions on internal movement.
Fiscal support (Supplementary Fig. 3c): We obtain the data from the Database of Fiscal Policy
Responses to COVID-19 provided by the International Monetary Fund17. This variable reflects
the critical fiscal measures that were announced or taken by each government in response to
the COVID-19 outbreak as of June 12, 2020.
Weather variables: For a robustness check, we include temperature, temperature squared,

precipitation, and precipitation squared as the control variables. The data are obtained from
the Meteorological Agency of Japan 18. We use weather data from 909 stations, which do not
have any missing values on temperature and precipitation during our study period. Using the
six monitoring stations that are closest to the population centre in each city, and the inverse of
the distance from the population centre as the weights, we aggregate the data from stationlevel to city-level. The weights are inversely proportional to squared distance so that closer
stations are given higher weights.
Population: We use the population to construct suicide rates and to weight all the regressions. We
derive the data from the Population Estimates, managed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and Communications (MIAC)19. We use population measured in 2018 across gender and age
cohorts (children and adolescents: age 0~14, adults: age 15~64, and elderly: age over 65).
Because of data limitations, the age classification is slightly different from the suicide data.

Supplementary Note 2. Outbreaks of COVID-19 and response of the government in Japan
Until October 2020, Japan had faced two large COVID-19 outbreaks, the first mainly from
February to June 2020, and the second from July 2020 and afterward. The first case of the 2019
novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was confirmed in January 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
By February, the number of cases was increasing rapidly. Notably, the Diamond Princess cruise
ship, which docked off Yokohama Bay, was hit by the virus outbreak, with about 20% of
passengers and crew infected, raising concern about the disease. In response, the national
government banned large-scale gatherings and requested nationwide school closure (elementary
to high school) at the end of February.
In March, despite the government’s measures, the virus spread did not slow down. Cases
grew exponentially; for example, the total confirmed number of cases rose from 2,305 on April 1

to 10,283 on April 18. Given this, during this period, the government escalated anti-contagion
policies. On April 7, it declared a state of emergency in seven cities that lasted about a month, and
expanded it to all cities on April 16, in which citizens were requested to close schools (elementary
to high school, and some universities delayed the start of their academic calendar), shops, and
enterprises, and to stay home if possible. While there was high compliance, these actions were
not mandated but requested (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig.1b). These nationwide efforts led to the
containment of the virus. By the end of the May, in most prefectures, the daily new cases were
brought down to below ten. Therefore, the state of emergency was lifted from prefectures where
the infection situation was relatively mild on May 14, 2020, and nationwide on May 25, 2020.
However, another outbreak of COVID-19, which was larger than the first one, took place in
the country. The number of infections began increasing again in late June 2020 and reached a peak
in early August 2020 (around 1,500 confirmed cases per day). Unlike the large-scale health
interventions implemented during the first outbreak, the national government was reluctant to
enforce such extensive measures. Instead, the prefectural governments initiated tailored and
focused health interventions to control disease hotspots. For example, the Tokyo prefectures
requested that bars and restaurants shorten their business hours at the end of August, which led
to a declining trend of the disease spread.
As is the case with many other countries, containment measures brought about an economic
downturn: OECD estimated Japan’s real GDP growth declined by 6.0% with the single-hit
scenario and by 7.3% with the double-hit scenario.20 Unemployment rates have been gradually
increasing from 2.3% in January 2020 to 3.1% in October 2020. 5 The Coincident Index (one of the
indexes of business conditions) has been worsening from 94.1 in January 2020 (2015=100) to 89.7
in October 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). 13
In response to the financial crisis, the government of Japan has made various subsidies and

benefits in cash and in kind available to all citizens and those who have lost their income. These
include cash benefits (100,000 yen ≈ 940 USD) for all citizens; compensation for those who have
lost their income for living funds and housing, and for sick leaves; increased child allowance and
support for using childcare services; monetary support including the postponement of payment
for social insurance; and loans without interest and security for freelance workers 21. Among those
subsidies and benefits, the Short-Time Compensation, provided for vulnerable enterprises to
stabilise their employment, plays a significant role in curbing a rise in the unemployment rate.
The number of claims for business subsidy drastically increased to about 1,800,000 in late October
(Fig. 6).
In our analyses, we define the pandemic period as between February 2020 and October 2020,
because we believe the outbreaks in Japan and the cruise ship Diamond Princess, and the
subsequent government measures, could have affected the suicidal behaviours among Japanese
citizens. We further classify the period between February and June as the first outbreak, and
thereafter as the second outbreak. Additionally, we define the period of the state of emergency as
April and May in 2020, and the school closure (elementary to high school) as March and April
2020.

Supplementary Note 3. Suicide in Japan
Overall trend: Suicide in Japan is a serious social issue, being among the top 10 causes of death
for those aged between 10 and 69: notably, it is the leading cause of death among the population
aged 15-39, the second for ages 40-49, the third for ages 50-54, and the fourth for ages 55-5922.
Additionally, suicide rates in Japan have been higher than in many other high-income countries:
The Japanese suicide rate is the seventh highest among high-income countries as classified by the
World Bank23 and OECD.24

Demography: From November 2016 to October 2020, there were 76,626 suicides with an average
monthly rate of 12.8 per million population. There are large gender and age disparities in suicide
rates. The suicide rate among males is about 2.3 times higher than that among females (per-month
suicide rate is 18.0 per million for males and 7.8 per million for females). Particularly, males aged
20-69, who are mainly the working population, are at the highest risk of suicide (21.5 per million).
A previous finding suggests that suicide deaths among males can largely be attributable to
financial and economic issues. The study finds that, during the economic crisis in the 1990s, the
suicide rate in Japan drastically increased, and it remained high thereafter. 25
Although women’s suicide rate is much lower than men’s, it is the third-highest rate among
OECD countries.24 A study investigating 193 suicide attempts suggests that family problems or
loneliness could trigger mental disorders among females, while economic issues and workrelated problems are the main sources among males26.
Suicide is one of the top causes of death among children and youth, even though those aged
below 20 were at the lowest risk within the Japanese population (3.2 per million). The main causes
of suicide in young generations were related to school issues. In fact, studies suggest that suicides
among children and youth increase when a school session begins after a long vacation. 27
Furthermore, suicide attempts were associated with school bullying, being a sexual minority, and
juvenile delinquency.28
Social determinants: While the reasons behind suicide are extremely complex, Japan’s suicide
rates have been associated with macroeconomic conditions, particularly the unemployment rate 29,
and the association is stronger than in other OECD countries 30. During the financial crisis from
1997 to 1998, major financial institutions went bankrupt, and suicide rates sharply increased. They
remained high in the next decade, when the country’s economy stagnated. In the 2010s, the
unemployment rate started to decline (from 4.3% in 2012 to 2.4% in 2019), and the total number

of suicides also began declining. This trend continued until recently: we observe that, on average,
the suicide rate declined by 6.4% during our study period (per-month suicide rate is 13.22 per
million in 2017 and 12.38 in 2019).
Although economic recession could increase suicide risk, economic policies can mitigate its
negative impact. A previous finding suggests that larger government expenditures were
associated with a decreased suicide rate among men aged 40-64, particularly when the
unemployment rate was high31.
Other social factors, such as occupation, overwork32, marital status, and social support33, are
reported as factors associated with suicide among the Japanese population.
Means: People took their own lives mainly at home, and the most common way of committing
suicide was hanging, which comprised more than 60% of the cases and is a common method in
many other countries34. Jumping (from a building or in front of a moving train) and charcoalburning suicide (death by carbon monoxide poisoning) were also prevailing methods (around
10%).
Japan is remarkably different from the U.S. in its major suicide means. Thus, the concern in
the U.S. that suicide deaths by firearm may increase during the COVID-19 pandemic subsequent
to heightened gun sales35,36 does not appear to be relevant to Japan.

Supplementary Note 4. Psychological response after natural disasters
We have found that suicide declined during the first COVID-19 outbreak. This may be because
of positive psychological responses to the crisis, called the pulling-together effect or honeymoon
phase. Existing studies often find a drop in suicide rates after national disasters, including
Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terrorist attack. During the COVID-19 outbreak, virus
containment measures required citizens to reduce their social contacts collaboratively, and this

might have generated a sense of partnership within communities. Another explanation could be
that the pandemic might have altered individuals’ views on life. Facing real mortal risk, people
might have started thinking of life as more precious and death as more frightening, which could
have prevented them from committing suicide.
The existing literature suggests that there are six phases of a disaster 37: (1) a Pre-Disaster phase:
feelings of vulnerability, worry about safety, and responsibility for subsequent negative
consequences to loved ones or damage to property; (2) the Impact phase: feelings of disbelief,
numbness, fear, confusion, and panic immediately after an event; (3) the Heroic phase:
predominant rescue and survival behaviours for adaptation to the environment following
assistance from others; (4) the Honeymoon phase: feelings of hopefulness and optimism due to
community bonding arising from sharing the catastrophic experience in addition to mutual
cooperation; (5) the Disillusionment phase: feelings of disappointment and resentment due to
unmet emotional and physical needs because of withdrawn supports; (6) the Reconstruction
phase: during the process of attempting to revive environments, some people may become
resilient and strong, while heterogeneous and intertemporal responses among individuals tend
to correspond to trauma level, available resources, and coping skills.
In cases of natural disasters, a systematic review 38 of the literature suggests that some studies
report that suicide rates dropped in the initial post-disaster period (phase 4), while it eventually
increased in the later period (phase 6). Although the COVID-19 pandemic and past natural
disasters are distinctive in magnitude, our results showing a reduction and subsequent increase
in the suicide rate are consistent with the prevalent patterns in previous literature (phases 4 and
5).

Supplementary Note 5. Augmented Interrupted Analysis and Different Specifications
The interrupted time-series analysis is an approach to assess the effect of large-scale
intervention using longitudinal data. Because the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is extensive,
and it hit the entire country, the use of this approach seems to be reasonable. However, we think
this approach could generate biased estimates for at least two reasons.
First, as discussed in the Methods section, the pandemic's effects on the suicide rate could be
confounded by seasonality. We observe that the suicide rate in February (13.0 per million) is 5.1%
higher than that in January (12.4 per million) before the pandemic (2017~2019). If we adopt
interrupted time-series analysis, which compares the suicide trend between 2020 January and
2020 February (before and after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic), the estimates might
capture the seasonal variation.
Second, the interrupted time-series analysis assumes that 1) the suicide rate changes
immediately after the initial outbreak, and 2) thereafter, the slope of the time-trend is linearly
altered. However, the suicide effect of the pandemic seemingly appears in different ways. During
the first outbreak, the number of confirmed cases gradually increased, and people may have
incrementally realised the adverse impacts of the pandemic, making the first assumption
unrealistic. Additionally, the extent of the adverse effects could vary across periods during the
outbreak. For instance, people may feel more stress when there are more cases, the government
implements strict regulations, and economic downturn is more severe, making the second
assumption unsuitable.
Here, we propose an alternative strategy to estimate the effects of the pandemic, adopting a
similar framework to the interrupted analysis. To do so, we first “residualise” the suicide rates
by controlling for the city-specific time trend and seasonality39. Intuitively, we use the "left-over"
that cannot be explained by the location-specific time trend and seasonality, rather than the real
11

suicide rate. This can be written as:
𝑌𝑖𝑦𝑚 = exp[ 𝜇𝑖𝑦𝑚 + 𝛾𝑖𝑦 ] ∗ 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(S1)

where 𝜇𝑖𝑦𝑚 denotes the city-specific time-trend and 𝛾𝑖𝑦 represents the city-specific month fixed
effects. The residual (𝑒𝑖𝑦𝑚 ) is computed as the difference between the fitted value
(counterfactual) and realised value (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Using the residual, we can try the interrupted analysis. Note that we keep the panel structure
of the data instead of the longitudinal design.
𝑒𝑖𝑦𝑚 = 𝛽 ∗ 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼𝑝𝑟𝑒.𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 ∗ 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛼𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡,𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 ∗ 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(S2)

We keep the data before and after the 9 months of the COVID-19 outbreak (May 2019 to October
2020). 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡 takes 1 if it is before the pandemic (May 2019 to January 2020), and 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 takes 1 if
it is during the pandemic (February 2020 to October 2020). 𝛽 measures the immediate effects and
the 𝛼𝑝𝑟𝑒.𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 and 𝛼𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡,𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 represents the linear slope of the time trend during the preintervention and the post-intervention.
The results show that the suicide rate declined by 2.52 points (19.8%) immediately after the
intervention, and the slope becomes 0.58 points (4.6%) from -0.002 points (Supplementary Fig.
4b). However, again, it may be challenging to interpret these coefficients because the effects
cannot be expressed as immediate effects (𝛽) and time trend effects (𝛼𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡,𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 -𝛼𝑝𝑟𝑒.𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 ).
Alternatively, we estimate
𝑒𝑖𝑦𝑚 = 𝛼𝑓 ∗ 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 + 𝛼𝑠 ∗ 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 + 𝜀𝑖𝑦𝑚

(S3)

where, 𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑚 and 𝑆𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑚 are analogous to equation (2). In this specification, we non-linearly
measure the relative level of the residual compared to the pre-pandemic periods. We find that the
suicide rate declined by 0.96 points (7.56%) during the first outbreak and increased by 2.09 points
(16.4%) during the second outbreak (Supplementary Fig. 4c). These results are quantitively
similar to our main results.
