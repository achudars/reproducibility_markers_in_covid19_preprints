Abstract
In susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic models, with the exponentially

14

distributed duration of exposed/infectious statuses, the mean generation interval (GI, time lag between

15

infections of a primary case and its secondary case) equals the mean latent period (LP) plus the mean

16

infectious period (IP). It was widely reported that the GI for COVID-19 is as short as 5 days. However,

17

many works in top journals used longer LP or IP with the sum (i.e., GI), e.g., > 7 days. This discrepancy

18

will lead to overestimated basic reproductive number, and exaggerated expectation of infectious attack

19

rate and control efficacy, since all these quantities are functions of basic reproductive number. We argue

20

that it is important to use suitable epidemiological parameter values.

Introduction
Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases pathogens remain an enormous issue for public

27

health and socio-economic growth because they can spread rapidly worldwide. Coronavirus disease

28

2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

29

(SARS-CoV-2) (Li et al., 2020; WHO, 2021), has been a tremendous public health problem affecting

30

every corner of the world (WHO, 2021). Since its appearance in late 2019, about 124 million people

31

contracted and over 2.7 million died worldly as of 25 March 2021 (WHO, 2021). Until recently, many

32

clinical features and underlying etiology of the SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Timely treatment and

33

effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) control measures against disease is important for

34

timely mitigation (WHO, 2021).

35

Generation interval (GI), which can also be referred to as the generation time, is the time lag

36

between infection incidents in an infector-infectee pair (Svensson, 2007). It is a proxy of serial interval

37

(SI) of infectious disease, which is the time lag between onsets of the symptoms in an infector-infectee

38

pair (Ali et al., 2020). The SI and GI are vital biological quantities (epidemic parameters) used for

39

estimating the basic reproductive number (denoted by

40

cases that one infected person will generate on average over the course of his/her infectious period in a

41

population that is completely susceptible (Li et al., 2020; Musa et al., 2020a), as well as time-varying

42

basic reproduction number,

43

infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts (Ali et al., 2020).

44

Moreover, the importance of GI is also reflected in the renewal equation

೟షೖ

, where 

46

 represents the daily instantaneous
reproductive number, which reflects transmission dynamics at a time,  (Park et al., 2020). Recently,

47

many works have been done to understand and/or estimate the GI, and its proxy, i.e., SI, associated with

48

infectious diseases, including the SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 (Ali et al., 2020; He et al., 2020b;

49

Lipsitch et al., 2003; Nishiura et al., 2020; Svensson, 2007; Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007; Wang et al.,

50

2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b).

51

Previous reports highlighted that when the SI is larger, the uncertainty and overestimation will be

52

higher (Ali et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020a). The SI (which depends hugely on the incubation period of

53

infectious disease) can be negative if the start of the symptoms in the infectee happens earlier than the

54

start of the symptoms in the infector (person who transmit the disease) (Du et al., 2020; Ganyani et al.,

55

2020a; Kong et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020; Tindale et al., 2020; Zhao, 2020). The SI can also be negative

56

when the incubation period has a wider range than the latent period, which may result in pre-

57

asymptomatic transmission as reported in recent COVID-19 studies (Ali et al., 2020; He et al., 2020b).

58

However, unlike SI, the GI is solely non-negative according to its definition (Wallinga and Lipsitch,

59

2007; Yan, 2008).

60

The incubation period is the time between infection and the onset of symptoms (Yan, 2008).

61

Although the time of exposure for an individual who transmits the disease (infector) is usually

62

indistinguishable, the time of exposure of an individual who gets the infection (infectee) can be

63

determined by the contact tracing history of the ‘infector-infectee’ pair. This subsequently indicates that

64

for ‘infector-infectee’ pairs, there is a single infector that relates to the infectee epidemiologically.

65

Hence, the incubation periods of infectees may be identifiable. However, the latent period differs from

66

the incubation period, it is defined as the time lag between the infection in exposure and onset

67

(beginning) of infectiousness of a typical case (Yan, 2008). Since the beginning of infectiousness is

68

indistinguishable, the latent period is unidentifiable. Thus, we noticed that in many diseases (mostly

69

infectious), the mean latent period is less than or equal to the mean incubation period (such as COVID-

70

19) (Ali et al., 2020), whereas some diseases have a long latent period, e.g., Ebola virus disease. Note

71

that people infected with Ebola are not infectious until the symptoms started, the incubation period of

72

Ebola varies between 2-21 days).

73

Moreover, the latent period is the time interval when an infected individual is unable to transmit

74

the disease. While the time interval during which an infected individual can transmit the disease is called

75

the infectious period. Both are random variables and are considered independent, thus, the LP and IP are

76

not generally traceable. However, SI is identifiable and well-studied, and reported by epidemic models

77

(Lipsitch et al., 2003; Nishiura et al., 2020). We observed that some studies in the literature did not use

78

the LP and IP appropriately, as the sum of their mean equals to the mean generation interval in SEIR-

79

based models, that is, mean GI = mean LP + mean IP. Using the same notation as in (Svensson, 2007),

80

we have that, the expectation of the random generation interval is given by  

81

     , where

and

82

random latent time and random infectious time, respectively. Details on this relation in the SEIR-based

83

model can be found in Svensson (Svensson, 2007).

84
85

Furthermore, it is of vital importance to forecast the size of the outbreak, including infection attack
rate (AR), the need for ventilators and hospital beds, the expected severe cases and deaths, the herd

immunity threshold, and the vaccine supply needed. All of these are associated with the time-varying

87

basic reproductive number,

88

estimation more accurately. Therefore, it is crucial to use the proper value for the mean LP and mean IP

89

in SEIR compartmental models. In this work, we showed that longer IP or LP leads to an overestimation

90

of reproductive number, using COVID-19 confirmed death cases data for Belgium, Israel, and the

91

United Arab Emirates (UAE). We noticed that Belgium was hit badly by two waves. Israel and UAE

92

have started large-scale vaccination programs. We choose these countries (as an example) to

93

demonstrate the impact of the GI on

94

controlling the disease outbreaks.

Here, S, E, I, R, H, and D represent susceptible, exposed, infection, recovered, hospitalized, and death

classes. The parameters , , ,  are transmission rate, progression rate from E to I, recovery rate (for

In the classic susceptible-exposed-recovered-based models, the mean GI of an infectious disease

128

equals the sum of the mean latent period (LP) and the mean infectious period (IP) (Svensson, 2007). The

duration of individuals in an exposed/infectious class follows exponential distributions. Due to the

142

compared to other diseases.

143

Results and discussion

144

Based on a recent study on GI and SI, we observed that most studies showed that the SI (and/or

145

GI) of COVID-19 varies between 5-6 days (Griffin et al., 2020). In particular, Ferretti et al. (Ferretti et

146

al., 2020) reported the mean GI as 5.0 days, Ganyani et al. (Ganyani et al., 2020b) used the data for

147

Singapore and Tianjin, China, and found that the mean GI is estimated at 5.20 (3.78 – 6.78) days and

148

3.95 (3.01 – 4.91) days, respectively. In forty research papers reviewed by Griffin et al. (Griffin et al.,

149

2020) on the GI and SI, only three studies provided an estimate for the mean GI, which varies roughly

150

between 3.95 to 5.20 days. And one paper provided an estimate for the median of the GI as 5.0 days

151

(Backer et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020; Griffin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Furthermore, Zhang et al.

152

(Zhang et al., 2020) reported that the incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated at 5.2 (95%CI: 1.8-

153

12.4), and the mean IP at 4.4 (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) from Dec 24 to Jan 27, 2020, and 2.6 (95%CI: 0.0-9.0)

154

from Jan 28 to Feb 17, 2020.

155

However, several studies reported the period of disease progression before the infectiousness

156

stage as the LP in an SEIR epidemic model. For example, Yin et al. (Yin et al., 2021) conducted a

157

modelling study to assess the effectiveness of NPIs measures (including contact tracing, facemask

158

wearing, and rapid testing) to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 in China. They reported that

159

asymptomatic patients lasted 4.6 days in LP and 9.5 days in IP until removal. See Table 1 for more

160

details. Many studies did not follow the rule that mean GI= mean LP + mean IP < 6 days. Therefore, we

161

emphasized that appropriate use of the generation interval in an epidemiological study is essential to

162

effectively control the COVID-19 outbreaks, because it provides a more accurate estimate on

163

reproduction number for the epidemics, and is crucial for pandemic mitigation planning and forecasting.

164

For demonstration purposes, we compared epidemiologic dynamics of COVID-19 for some

165

randomly selected countries (Belgium, Israel, and UAE) while varying LP and IP from (2 & 3 days to 3

166

& 6 days). We employed the model to the COVID-19 mortality data and obtained the time series fitting

167

results using the COVID-19 data for Belgium, Israel, and UAE to quantify the effects of longer GI on

168

the estimation of (time-varying) reproduction numbers. In Figure 2 we show the fitting results of the

169

daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths (red circled) with proper LP and IP at 2 & 3 days. in (a) Belgium, (b)

170

Israel, and (c) UAE, respectively. The median of the simulation is represented by the black curve, and

171

the time-varying basic reproduction number is denoted by the blue dashed curve. The 95% range of the

172

simulation is shown by the shaded gray region. In Figure 3, we compare six scenarios, corresponding

173

  ,   0.1, and   0.05, with proper GI (LP and IP at 2 & 3 days) versus long GI (LP=3 days and

174

IP=6 days) for each country. From Figure 3, we discovered that using longer mean LP and mean IP

175

would significantly increase an estimate of reproduction number. Thus, the magnitude of reduction in

176

the initial reproduction number would be much higher in the latter cases (3&6 days for LP&IP) than in

177

the proper former cases (2&3 days for LP&IP). Besides, a higher initial reproduction number would

178

imply a much higher expected infection attack rate and herd immunity threshold.

179

Furthermore, a summary results of the COVID-19 infection attack rates (AR) for Belgium,

180

Israel, and UAE is presented in Table 2 with reasonable LP and IP values. The choice of LP and IP had

181

an important influence on the estimate of AR, likely due to the choice of the flexible transmission rate in

182

our model, and the assumption of the infection fatality rate which varies between 0.5% to 1%.

183

Appendix Table 1 presents the results of the estimated parameter values using the log-likelihood

184

estimation approach for Belgium, Israel, and UAE. We observed that Belgium has the lowest log

185

likelihood values, indicating that Belgium was hit harder than the other two countries. also, a summary

186

results of the estimated values for the time-varying transmission rate with a fixed number of nodes

187

(denoted by $ ) was given in Appendix Table 2. The initial values for the state variables used for the

188

model given in Appendix Table 3. Therefore, based on the results obtained and the comparison of the

189

epidemic dynamics of COV-ID-19 for Belgium, Israel, and UAE with varying LP and IP, we argue that

190

appropriate LP and IP should be used in epidemiological modelling study to effectively mitigate the

191

spread of disease and to provide suitable suggestions of control strategies for public health

192

implementation and policymaking.

193

Conclusions

194

Mean LP, IP, and GI are essential quantities in epidemiological modelling studies that are used

195

for the estimation of reproductive number of an infectious disease. For COVID-19, current knowledge

196

showed that the mean GI (mean LP + mean IP) varies between 5-6 days, which implies that the mean

197

LP/IP in SEIR models should be around 2-3 days, respectively. We emphasized that this estimate should

198

be used to provide a reasonable estimation of the reproductive number (

Belgium, Israel, and UAE are elevated substantially when longer LP and IP are used. Since now

assessment with a longer GI will lead to overestimated control effectiveness.
