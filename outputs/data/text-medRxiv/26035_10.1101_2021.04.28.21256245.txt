Abstract

39
40

Background: SARS-CoV-2 can spread efficiently in hospitals, but the transmission pathways

41

amongst patients and healthcare workers are unclear.

42
43

Methods: We analysed data from four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK, from January to

44

October 2020. Associations between infectious SARS-CoV-2 individuals and infection risk were

45

quantified using logistic, generalised additive and linear mixed models. Cases were classified as

46

community- or hospital-acquired using likely incubation periods.

47
48

Results: Nine-hundred and twenty of 66184 patients who were hospitalised during the study

49

period had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within the same period (1%). Out of these, 571

50

patients had their first positive PCR tests while hospitalised (62%), and 97 of these occurred at

51

least seven days after admission (11%). Amongst the 5596 healthcare workers, 615 (11%) tested

52

positive during the study period using PCR or serological tests. For susceptible patients, one day

53

in the same ward with another patient with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 was associated with

54

an additional eight infections per 1000 susceptible patients (95%CrI 6-10). Exposure to an

55

infectious patient with community-acquired COVID-19 or to an infectious healthcare worker was

56

associated with substantially lower infection risks (2/1000 susceptible patients/day, 95%CrI 1-2).

57

As for healthcare worker infections, exposure to an infectious patient with hospital-acquired

58

SARS-CoV-2 or to an infectious healthcare worker were both associated with an additional one

59

infection per 1000 susceptible healthcare workers per day (95%CrI 1-2). Exposure to an

60

infectious patient with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 was associated with half this risk

61

(0.5/1000 susceptible healthcare workers/day, 95%CrI 0.3-0.7).

62
63

Interpretation: Exposure to patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 poses a substantial

64

infection risk. Infection control measures to limit nosocomial transmission must be optimised to

65

protect both staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Research in context

74

Evidence before this study

75

We searched the PubMed database using the search terms (”COVID-19” OR ”SARS-CoV-2”)

76

AND (”nosocomial” OR ”hospital”) AND (”transmission”) in either the abstracts or titles, for

77

English-language articles published up to March 31, 2021. This returned 748 results, out of

78

which ten reported transmission events in the hospital setting quantitatively. These publications

79

can be broadly categorised to epidemiological descriptions of isolated outbreaks (5) or contact

80

tracing of patients exposed to infected healthcare workers (1), retrospective cohort studies

81

involving a particular group of patients, e.g., patients who underwent surgical procedures (2),

82

and using genomic sequencing to identify transmission clusters (2). None of the studies reported

83

the comparative transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 amongst patients and staff.

84
85

Added value of this study

86

This study reports the analysis of a large observational dataset collected from a group of

87

hospitals in the UK over eight months, consisting of both hospitalised patients and healthcare

88

workers. Based on these detailed individual-level data, we quantified the associations between

89

patient and healthcare worker characteristics and risks for acquiring nosocomial SARS-CoV-2

90

infection after adjusting for their exposures to SARS-CoV-2. Over the study period, we describe

91

how risk of acquisition changes both with calendar time and over a patient’s hospital stay. By

92

linking the presence of infected and susceptible patients and healthcare workers by time and

93

ward locations, we quantify the relative importance of the transmission pathways for both the

94

susceptible patients and healthcare workers.

Implications of all the available evidence

97

Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common. Identifying the drivers of SARS-CoV-2

98

transmissions in the hospital setting is essential for designing infection prevention and control

99

policies to minimise the added pressure from such events on our health systems. We found that

100

newly infected patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital pose the highest risk of

101

onward transmission to other patients and healthcare workers. Infection control and prevention

102

efforts need to be enhanced around these patients to prevent further transmissions and studies

103

assessing the effectiveness of these policies are needed.

105

Introduction

106
107

Nosocomial transmission and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have been frequently reported in

108

various healthcare settings since the beginning of the pandemic. [1– 6] Reported proportions of

109

hospitalised COVID-19 patients suspected to have acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the hospitals vary

110

widely, ranging from <1% to 20%, [7–10] and a national data linkage study in England

111

estimated that 15% of laboratory-confirmed cases among hospital patients were healthcare-

112

associated. [11]

113
114

Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is of considerable concern. Hospitalised patients are

115

especially vulnerable to COVID-19 associated complications and mortality. [2] Infected patients

116

who are asymptomatic or become symptomatic after discharge from the hospital may contribute

117

to the further spread of SARSCoV-2 in the community and nursing homes. Healthcare workers

118

(HCW) are disproportionately infected with SARS-CoV-2. [12–15] They may be a key source of

119

viral transmission to patients and fellow colleagues. Reduced staff workforce due to SARS-CoV-

120

2 infection may compromise the clinical management of patients and infection prevention and

121

control measures. These threats remain relevant despite the introduction of vaccines as novel

122

variants can reduce the protection afforded, and their efficacy preventing onward transmissions

123

may only be partial.

124
125

Analysis of detailed individual-level data including information on patients at risk of becoming

126

infected has been lacking and the relative importance of different transmission pathways (e.g.

127

patient to HCW, HCW to patient, HCW to HCW and patient to patient) and has not, to our

128

knowledge, previously been quantified. [16] Improved understanding of the drivers of

129

nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection is of potential value for improving targeting of infection

130

prevention and control activities in hospitals.

131
132

The objectives of this analysis are to use high resolution individual-level data to quantify

133

associations between patient characteristics and risks for acquiring nosocomial SARS-CoV-2

134

infection after adjusting for exposures, describe how risk of acquisition changes both with

135

calendar time and over a patient’s hospital stay, and provide evidence about the relative

136

importance of different transmission pathways for both patients and HCW.

137
138

Methods

139

Study cohort

140

Data were obtained from Oxford University Hospitals, a group of four teaching hospitals

141

(denoted hospital A-D) in Oxfordshire, UK from 12 January 2020 to 2 October 2020. Two of the

142

four hospital sites (hospitals A and C) have an Emergency Department, and admitted

143

symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients directly from the community. Patient data included patient

144

demographics, location in the hospital on every day of stay, total length of stay, and SARS-CoV-

145

2 PCR test results (supplementary section 7 for details of PCR assays).

146
147

SARS-CoV-2 infections in hospital HCW were identified using PCR results from symptomatic

148

and asymptomatic testing at the hospital. Symptomatic testing was offered to staff from 27

149

March 2020 onwards and staff could participate in a voluntary asymptomatic screening

150

programme from 23 April 2020 onwards, offering testing up to once every two weeks.

151

Additionally, probable infections prior to widespread availability of testing were identified in

152

staff without a positive PCR result, but who were either anti-nucleocapsid or anti-spike IgG

153

antibody positive and recalled a date of onset of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. These

154

symptoms were the presence of fever and new persistent cough, or anosmia or loss of taste. [17,

155

18] Hospital HCW and patients who were on the same wards during the study period were

156

included in the analysis.

157
158

Data were classified as time-fixed and time-varying variables. Time-fixed variables included age

159

at admission, sex and ethnicity routinely collected in hospital records. Time-varying variables

160

included patients’ ward and hospital location, and the number of other patients and HCW known

161

to be infected (and likely infectious) present on the same ward while a patient was at risk of

162

becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2.

163
164

Deidentified patient data and data from HCW testing were obtained from electronic healthcare

165

records using the Infections in Oxfordshire Research Database (IORD) which has generic

166

Research Ethics Committee, Health Research Authority and Confidentiality Advisory Group

167

approvals (19/SC/0403, 19/CAG/0144).

169

Definitions and assumptions

170

Incubation period

171

We assumed that each individual could only be infected once, and hence patients and HCW were

172

no longer at risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 after their first positive PCR test. The day each

173

patient with a potential nosocomial infection became infected is unknown, but based on

174

knowledge of the incubation period distribution we expect it to be one to 20 days prior to the

175

date of symptom onset, with 83% falling between 3-7 days. [19] For a given incubation period,

176

d, we assume that each patient with a nosocomial infection became infected d days before the

177

date of symptom onset.

178
179

Among 245 inpatients testing positive after developing SARS-CoV-2 symptoms during

180

hospitalisation, the mean interval between symptom onset and their swab for PCR-testing was

181

one day (interquartile range 1-3). Consequently, we assumed that swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR

182

tests after hospital admission were taken in response to COVID-19-like symptom onset one day

183

earlier or, in asymptomatic cases, the swabs were assumed to have been taken one day after the

184

incubation period. The date of each patient’s first positive PCR test refers to the date the swab

185

was obtained, rather than tested if this differed (figure 1).

Figure 1: Illustration of assumed incubation periods and the data analysed for six example

188

patients. We assumed that PCR tests were performed one day after developing symptoms

189

consistent with COVID-19. In this schematic, an incubation period of five days was used. Each

190

hospitalised patient day from admission until (and including) the day of the assumed infection

191

event (i.e. six (incubation period plus one) days prior to the swab leading to the patient’s first

192

positive PCR test) or six days prior to the day of discharge or death (whichever occurred first)

193

was considered an observation where the patient was at risk of becoming infected. Each

194

observation, unique to a specific patient on a specific day, therefore corresponds to an outcome

195

t.
six days later when the patient could potentially have a swab taken for a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test.

196

An observation had a positive outcome (value of 1) if the patient had a positive PCR test for the

197

first time resulting from a swab taken in the hospital six days later, and a negative outcome

198

(value of 0) if the patient did not have a swab taken or had a swab taken resulting in a negative

199

PCR test six days later. The risk factors, e.g., ward, number of infectious patients or healthcare

200

workers in the same ward, for each observation were taken from the day of the observation itself
lf

201

when the corresponding patient was at risk of becoming infected.

203

Definitions of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections

204

Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections have previously been defined as ‘probable’ when

205

symptoms onset is on day 8-14 after admission and ‘definite’ when symptoms onset is on day

206

>14 after admission. [20] These increasing thresholds correspond to higher certainties that a case

207

is hospital-acquired (supplementary figure S5). [20] In this study, however, we used incubation

208

periods that are the most likely to identify the exposure risk factors, i.e., the locations and

209

infectious individuals the susceptible individuals were exposed to, which could have resulted in

210

an observed infection event. Our baseline assumption was that the incubation period was five

211

days (which is reported to be the median value [20]) , and we therefore define hospital-acquired

212

infections to be any PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection where the patient was a hospital

213

inpatient six days prior to the first positive PCR test. We also report results for sensitivity

214

analyses assuming incubation periods of three and seven days. Community-acquired infections

215

are defined to be any PCR-confirmed infections in patients who were not hospitalised in the 20

216

days prior to their first positive PCR tests.

217
218

Accounting for varying infectiousness

219

We assumed that patients were infectious for a period of ten days starting a day after the day of

220

presumed infection, consistent with estimates that 99.7% of onward infection takes place within

221

the first ten days after the presumed infection event. [21, 26] HCW were assumed to be

222

infectious from a day after the day of assumed infection to the day of symptom onset or one day

223

prior to having a positive PCR test (i.e., staff were assumed to be absent from work after

224

reporting symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having a positive PCR test).

225
226

In the main analyses presented in the Results section, we considered infectiousness to be binary.

227

To account for time-varying infectiousness in relation to the time of presumed infection event,

228

we repeated the analysis after scaling the numbers of infectious patients and HCW in a ward on a

229

particular day by their relative infectiousness, using the generation time distribution derived by

230

Ferretti et al [21] such that the sum of daily terms for a single infected patient or HCW who was

231

present in the ward throughout their entire infectious period would equal one.

232
233

Infection prevention and control measures

234

There were two major changes made to infection prevention and control measures during the

235

study period. Prior to 1 April 2020 (phase 1) use of “level-1” personal protective equipment

236

(PPE; apron, gloves, a surgical face mask and optional eye protection) was recommended for

237

contact with patients known or suspected to have COVID-19 with use of “level-2” PPE (gown,

238

gloves, eye protection, FFP3/N99 mask) for aerosol generating procedures. From 1 April 2020

239

(phase 2) universal level-1 PPE was used for all patients regardless of test results or clinical

240

suspicion of COVID-19. From 25 April 2020 (phase 3), additionally, all patients were tested for

241

SARS-CoV-2 by PCR on admission and at weekly intervals irrespective of symptoms. Further

242

measures were implemented subsequently from June onwards, which include universal masking

243

and social distancing amongst staff, contact tracing and isolation of exposed patients and HCW,

244

establishment of COVID-19 dedicated areas, improved triage and recognition of atypical

245

symptoms in elderly patients.

247

Statistical models

248

We first performed exploratory analyses using univariable and multivariable logistic regression

249

models to determine associations between risk factors and SARS-CoV-2 infection for given

250

incubation periods (supplementary section 6 code block 1). To assess how well these individual

251

demographic factors and infection pressures from infectious patients and healthcare workers on

252

the same wards accounted for the nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections over calendar time, we

253

used generalised additive models which allowed for the risk of infection to depend in a non-

254

linear manner on the predictors (supplementary section 6 code block 2) The generalised additive

255

models were implemented using the R package mgcv. [22]

256
257

We then modelled the patients’ and HCW’ daily risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital

258

using a generalised linear mixed model with an identity link (supplementary section 6 code block

259

3). This model allowed the daily probability of infection to scale linearly with infection pressure

260

from HCW and patients and for their effects to be additive. These models were implemented

261

with JAGS (version 4-10) which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to generate a sequence of

262

dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters. [23]

263
264

Two versions of the models, one with interaction terms between the phases and forces of

265

infection from patients and HCW, and one without the interaction terms, were performed. Model

266

comparison was done using the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) where lower

267

values indicate improved model fit. [24]

Results

281

Patient characteristics

282

There were 66,184 patients admitted to the four hospitals from 12 January to 2 October, 2020, a

283

time period that covered only the first ‘wave’ of infection in the UK. Amongst these patients, 920

284

(920/ 66,184, 1%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Out of these, 571 patients had their first

285

positive PCR tests while hospitalised (62%), and 97 were on admission day seven or later (11%).

286

The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The patients who likely acquired SARS-CoV-2

287

while in hospital (assuming incubation periods of 5, 3 or 7 days) were older, had longer lengths

288

of stays and more readmissions compared to patients with no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests.

Testing capacity increased substantially after the beginning of March 2020 (figure 2A). The

302

weekly incidence of newly detected SARS-CoV-2 infections in the four hospitals, including both

303

community-acquired and nosocomial cases, peaked between March and May 2020.

305

Two-hundred and seventy-one patients had at least one day of hospitalisation in the 20 days prior

306

to being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Out of these patients, 130 (48%) were inpatients on

307

their day of infection, based on an assumed incubation period of five days. One-hundred and two

Healthcare worker characteristics

326

Out of a total of 13,514 HCW in the four hospitals participating in HCW testing at some time,

327

5,596 worked on a single ward only such that their SARS-CoV-2 status could be considered with

328

patients admitted to the same wards in the analysis. Eleven percent (615/5596) were positive for

329

SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Amongst those who were positive, 57% (353/615) had a

330

positive PCR test, while the rest were diagnosed based on serology.

Table 2: Characteristics of the healthcare workers included in the analysis.

335
336

The timelines of the numbers of susceptible patients and infectious patients and HCW on each

337

ward showed that most of the peaks in the number of potential transmission events occurred

338

between March and June 2020 (figure S1). On most wards there was considerable overlap

339

between the time series for infectious HCW and patients and the time series of transmission

340

events.

341
342

Transmission risk to patients

343

We first used multivariable logistic regression to identify the factors associated with nosocomial

344

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to susceptible patients (table 3). Infection risk reduced with the

345

introduction of more stringent infection prevention and control measures in phase three (adjusted

346

odds ratio, aOR 0.25, 95%CI 0.14, 0.42). Presence of patients with hospital-acquired SARS-

347

CoV-2 was associated with the highest risk of acquisition in susceptible patients (aOR, 1.76,

348

95%CI 1.51, 2.04), followed by the presence of infected HCW (aOR 1.45, 95%CI 1.22,1.71).

349

The evidence that patients with community onset COVID-19 were associated with increased

350

transmission was weaker (aOR 1.12, 95%CI 0.96,1.26).

Table 3: Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection in admitted patients during their hospital stay from

358

multivariable logistic regression results.

In addition to phases, calendar days was included as a non-linear independent variable in the logistic
regression, fitted with a linear spline function with two knots.

359
360

To further investigate if the demographic variables and transmissions from infectious patients

361

and HCW adequately accounted for patient acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, we used these variables

362

in a generalised additive model (supplementary section 3.1 model P2). After adjusting for these

363

variables, the results showed that the variation in the risk of nosocomial infection over the study

364

period remained though at a reduced level, suggesting that transmission risks were incompletely

365

accounted for (figure 3 panel A). We further used the above generalised additive model to

366

explore how risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection varied with day of hospitalisation

367

(supplementary figure S2). This risk remained largely constant throughout a patient’s hospital

368

stay once the numbers of infectious patients and HCW in the same ward were accounted for.

377

each day as the dependent variable. Infectious patients and healthcare workers were both

378

associated with increased risk of nosocomial infection. The presence of more infectious patients

379

or healthcare workers in a ward on a given day was associated with higher transmission risk.

380
381

A shortcoming of the logistic regression model is that it assumed the effect of each additional

382

infectious patient or HCW as multiplicative. Therefore, we used an alternative statistical model

383

that allows each extra infectious individual to increase the probability of infection in an additive

384

way (a generalised mixed model with an identity link). Infectious patients on the same ward who

385

were assumed to have hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 showed the strongest association with

386

acquisition of nosocomial COVID-19 in susceptible patients (figure 4). Using an assumed

387

incubation period of 5 days, the absolute risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 per day of exposure to a

388

patient with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.75% (95% credible interval, CrI

389

0.55-0.95%). The risks of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 per day of exposure to an infectious patient

390

who acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the community or to an infectious HCW were smaller. One day

391

exposure to an infected HCW or patient with community-acquired COVID19 was associated

392

with absolute risks of 0.20% (95%CrI 0.16-0.22%) and 0.17% (95%CrI 0.13-0.22%) respectively

393

for susceptible patients.

reduced in phase three (aOR 0.43, 95%CI 0.34, 0.53). The number of infectious HCW and

Using the alternative additive statistical model (figure 5), the strongest association was with

426

other infectious staff and patients with hospital-acquired SARSCoV-2. However, the additional

427

risks posed by exposures to these infectious HCW and patients to the susceptible HCW were less

428

compared to the that for susceptible patients. A single day of exposure to infected HCW and

429

patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 patients on the same ward was associated with an

430

increased absolute daily risk of 0.10% (95%CrI 0.04-0.20%). The corresponding increase in

431

absolute daily risk from a day of exposure to an infected patient with community-acquired

432

SARS-CoV-2 was 0.05% (95%CrI 0.03-0.07%).

433
434

The background transmission risks to HCW including that from community sources and

435

undetected cases amongst both HCW and patients were similar to those observed in the patients.

The contribution of these undetected cases to the daily risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition was

about 0.03% (95CrI 0.02-0.03%) and 0.02% (95%CrI 0.02-0.03%) for the susceptible patients

452
453

Discussion

454

The consistent finding in the above analysis is that the patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 in

455

the hospital and, to a lesser degree, infectious healthcare workers likely working prior to the

456

onset of symptoms, were the most strongly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2

457

transmission in the hospital setting. In contrast, exposure to patients who had acquired SARS-

458

CoV-2 in the community appeared to be associated with, at most, modest increases in the daily

459

risk of infection for both healthcare staff and the other patients. We found evidence of a dose-

460

response effect: exposure to more infectious patients and healthcare staff were both associated

461

with increasing daily risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2. These findings can parsimoniously be

462

explained by newly infected individuals having high transmission potential to patients and staff.

463

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that a substantial proportion of transmission precedes

464

symptom onset and point to rapidly declining infectiousness with time since symptom onset. [21,

465

26] Secondly, patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the community are more likely to first

466

present with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 upon admission and be rapidly segregated

467

from the susceptible population with careful implementation of infection prevention and control

468

guidelines.

469
470

There are several limitations in our analysis. Firstly, the dates on which the infected patients first

471

developed symptoms were not available. Hence, we needed to assume that the PCR test swabs
30

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256245; this version posted May 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

472

were taken on the symptom onset dates. While this assumption is reasonable based on the

473

analysis of a subset of data early in the pandemic, it is not true from phase three onwards when

474

weekly screening of patients regardless of symptoms was implemented. We addressed this by

475

performing sensitivity analysis comparing model outputs when using data collected during phase

476

one and two versus phase three (supplementary material section 5). Secondly, we assumed that

477

HCW were absent from work after the dates on which their first positive PCR test swabs were

478

taken or COVID-19 symptoms were first self-reported. However, where HCW experienced

479

minimal or no symptoms they may have continued to work. These issues could be further

480

explored using HCW absentee data in subsequent analysis.

481
482

A key challenge in this analysis is that the times of infection are unknown. This has led to the

483

adoption of various arbitrary cut-offs on length of stay prior to infection to define nosocomial

484

infection. Further analysis using data augmentation methods may potentially overcome this to

485

produce estimates that better account for different sources of uncertainty.

486
487

Other drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in the hospital setting not fully explained by

488

infection pressures, which we did not capture in the analysis, may include variation in ward

489

occupancy, community-acquired cases who did not develop symptoms until after hospitalisation,

490

change in nature or frequency of SARS-CoV-2 exposures throughout hospitalisation, or could

491

reflect frailties, i.e., those patients who have stayed 20 days and not been infected may be at

492

lower risk of infection. However, recent work using detailed epidemiological and genomic data

493

to infer transmission networks echoed our main finding that patients are more likely to be

494

infected by other patients than by HCWs. [27]

495
496

Our findings support enhanced infection prevention and control efforts to prevent and identify

497

early hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection. Where either community or local ward prevalence is

498

sufficiently high and resources permit, regular screening and prompt testing and identification of

499

such patients is important. Similarly, measures to ensure symptomatic staff are not at work,

500

including adequate sick pay arrangements, are vital. Regular staff screening is also likely to

501

reduce transmission. Staff acquisition and transient asymptomatic carriage, contamination of

502

equipment and the general environment or the air are possible mediators of transmission events

503

assigned in the analysis as patient-to-patient and need further investigation. The relatively low

504

risk of transmission associated with patients with suspected community-acquired COVID-19

505

suggests that for these patients the peak of their infectivity may have passed such that existing

506

infection prevention and control policies including universal PPE, prompt testing and isolation of

507

suspected or known cases [16] are sufficient to mitigate most of the remaining infectiousness.

508

Our analysis shows that despite these measures patients and staff are at risk from newly infected

509

individuals. Due to the difficulties in disentangling the effect of infection prevention and control

510

measures and surges in SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting, we cannot provide conclusive

511

evidence on how interventions around hospital-onset cases could be enhanced. However, others

512

have suggested enhanced PPE for HCW and ventilation may play a role. [28–31]

514

In conclusion, our data provide strong evidence that newly infected patients pose a high risk of

515

onward transmission to patients and healthcare workers in hospital. Further investigation is

516

needed into how best to enhance infection control and prevention efforts around these patients.

1. The timelines of potential nosocomial transmission events and the numbers of infectious

708

patients and HCW.

709
710

Figure S1. Weekly average numbers of transmission events and infectious patients and

711

healthcare workers in wards with at least 30 members of staff tested and 20 available patient

712

beds. The top row for each panel of graphs shows the weekly average number of patients who

713

had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and who were defined to have been infected in the hospital

714

on that ward during the indicated week based on the assumed incubation period of five days. The

715

second and third rows for each panel show the numbers of infectious patients defined as having

716

community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., no hospitalisation in the 20 days prior to first

717

positive tests), and patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital (i.e., inpatient on the sixth

718

day prior to first positive tests) respectively. For these plots, patients were considered to be

719

infectious for a period of ten days, starting one day after the day of the presumed infection event.

720

[20] The last row shows the number of infectious healthcare workers. Healthcare workers were

721

considered infectious from the day of the infection event until a day before their first positive

722

PCR test or report of COVID-19 related symptoms, whichever was earlier.

4. Generalised linear model with identity link (Model 3)

752

4.1 Model comparison

753

To quantify the daily transmission risk posed by infectious patients and healthcare workers, we

754

used a generalised linear mixed model with an identity link, thus allowing for the daily

755

probability of infection to scale linearly with infection pressure from healthcare workers and

756

patients and for their effects to be additive. Two models, one with interaction terms between the

757

phases and forces of infection from patients and healthcare workers, and one without the

758

interaction terms, were compared. Between these transmission models, the model with the best

759

fit to data by WAIC was the one without interaction terms, which has an intercept (α),

760

representing the infection risk not explained by covariates, and slopes (beta) which represent the

761

infection risk associated with infectious patients (community- and hospital-acquired) and

762

healthcare workers.

4.2 Model assessment of the main analysis models

773

Prior distributions were selected to be weakly informative half-normal distributions, such that the

774

prior values are kept positive. We assessed the models using measures of Markov chain

775

convergence including effective sample sizes and Rˆ which indicate if the chains had run for long

776

enough and had mixed well.

777
778

Plots of iterations vs. sampled values for model parameters in the MCMC chains. The three

779

different chains are plotted using different colours.

780
781

In the main analysis model where the outcome is hospital-acquired SARS-CoV2 infection

782

amongst the patients, the Rˆ values were about 1 and the minimum effective sample size was

783

1700 across all parameters. The chains mixing is shown below.

5. Sensitivity analysis

799

5.1 Infectiousness scaled by day of infection according to incubation period

800

Table S4: The main analysis considers infectiousness to be binary, i.e., absolute numbers of

801

infectious patients and healthcare workers in a ward on a particular day were used. Sensitivity

802

analysis considered infectiousness to be scaled according to the time since the day of infection

803

which, in turn, is based on an assumed incubation period of five days. This scaling of the number

804

of infectious patients and healthcare workers in a ward on a particular day makes use of the

805

relative infectiousness distribution derived by He et al [25] such that the sum of daily terms for a

806

single infected patient who was present in the ward throughout their entire infectious period

807

would equal one. Hence, the scaled parameters are an order of magnitude higher than the binary

808

infectiousness model estimates.
