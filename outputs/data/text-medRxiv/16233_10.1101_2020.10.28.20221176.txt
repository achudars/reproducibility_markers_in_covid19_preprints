Abstract :
Purpose: Determining the triggering factor of the sudden surge of the daily new COVID-19 cases
arising in most European countries during 2020 Autumn.
Methods: The dates of the surge were determined using a fitting of the two last months reported
daily new cases in 18 European countries of latitude ranging from 39° to 62°.
Results: The study proves no correlation between the country surge date and its 2 weeks preceding
temperature or humidity, but shows an impressive linear correlation with its latitude. The country
surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below ≈34% of that of 0°
latitude. Introducing reported seasonal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration
variation into reported link between acute respiratory track infection risk with 25(OH)D
concentration quantitatively explains the surge dynamics.
Conclusions: Several studies already substantiated a 25(OH)D concentration impact on COVID-19
severity. However by comparing different patients populations, discriminate whether low 25(OH)D
concentration is a real factor of covid-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness being the
primary severity factor can be challenging. The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation
and has the benefit to be only triggered by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. the sun
UV daily dose decreases. The results support that low 25(OH)D concentration is thus well a
contributing factor of COVID-19 severity, which joined with the previous studies makes a convincing
bundle of evidence

Introduction
Most European countries underwent in autumn an unexpected surge of the daily new COVID-19
cases (Fig. 1), imposing in emergency new confinement rules and lockdowns.

Figure 1: Typical examples of daily new COVID-19 cases (extracted from the Google home page when
searching “covid”). All curves exhibit a clear surge of the growing rates.

A common reported explanation is the decreasing temperature. The aim of this study is to challenge
this assumption against a pure latitude impact.

Material and method
Data sources
The countries daily new COVID-19 cases were obtained from the European Union agency European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publicationsdata/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).
The country population weighted center (PWC) latitudes were obtained from the Baylor University
population resource
(http://cs.ecs.baylor.edu/~hamerly/software/europe_population_weighted_centers.txt)
The averaged 2 weeks temperatures and humidity preceding the surge dates were computed from
https://rp5.ru which collects the archives of all the airport weather stations in the world. For each
country, an airport close to the PWC was chosen (see supplementary excel file). Averaged
temperature and humidity were computed between 8h00 to 20h00, outside this period the
population being mostly indoor.

School opening dates of 15 countries on the 18 ones studied were found at:

The theoretical sun UVB daily dose for vitamin D production, as a function of latitude and of the day
of the year, was derived from the digitalization of fig. 1B in [1].
All these data are in the supplementary excel file.

Surge date determination
The date of the surge was automatically determined by fitting the two last months of the daily new
COVID-19 cases with the empirical model:
𝑁𝑐 𝑒 (𝛼𝑐 +(𝛽𝑐 −𝛼𝑐 ) 𝑙(𝑡−𝑡𝑐 ) ) 𝑡

(1)

where 𝑙 is the logistic function:
𝑙 (𝑡 − 𝑡𝑐 ) =

1

(2)

1+𝑒 −𝛾(𝑡−𝑡𝑐 )

𝑡𝑐 is the date when the exponential coefficient, coming from the initial value 𝛼𝑐 , crosses the value
𝛼𝑐 + 𝛽𝑐
2

before tending towards 𝛽𝑐 when 𝑡 → ∞. 𝛾 is the steepness of this changing. The date of the

surge was defined as the time when 10% of

𝛼𝑐 + 𝛽𝑐
2

is added to 𝛼𝑐 , this choice corresponds to the date

when eq. 1 visually becomes different of the mono-exponential (see supplementary file). 𝛾 was
assumed country independent as we search for an impact of the latitude of its own. This further
allows to prevent an over-fitting of the data noise by a steepness tuned for each country.
Note that as the exponential coefficient varies with time, the doubling time around the surge date is
not simply ln(2) divided by this coefficient.

New daily cases dynamics models
In order to evaluate the impact of the UV insolation on the new daily cases dynamics we will consider
the simple model:
𝑑𝑁(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡

= 𝑘(𝑡) 𝑁(𝑡) − 𝜌 𝑁(𝑡)

(3)

where 𝑁(𝑡) is the total number of persons who have the active sars-cov-2 at time t , its derivative
being the new daily cases; 𝑘(𝑡) is the mean effective contagiousness of an infected subject which
mainly depends on his coronavirus release in air and on materials, on the closeness and frequency of
his contacts with other subjects.; ρ is the recovery rate. If the contagiousness is constant, the daily
new cases follows a mono-exponential increase or decrease:
𝑑𝑁(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡

= 𝑁𝑐 (𝑘 − 𝜌) 𝑒 (𝑘−𝜌) 𝑡

(4)

Where Nc is the initial number of infected persons in country c. We will consider two impacts of UV
insolation: outdoor sars-cov-2 inactivation and blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration.

Impact of outdoor sars-cov-2 inactivation by solar UV.
The active fraction survival of sars-cov-2 f under a constant UV insolation R is governed by:
𝑓 (𝜏) = 𝑒 −𝛼 𝑅 𝜏

(5)

where α is the solar UV sensitivity of sars-cov-2 and τ the insolation duration. A recent detailed
analysis [2] shows that in Europe the τ90, i.e. the noon solar insolation duration needed to inactivate
90% of the sars-cov-2, approximatively linearly increases between August and October from 60 to
150 minutes for south countries, and from 100 to 250 minutes for north countries.
Considering this inactivation as the single effect varying k(t), we get:
𝑘1 (𝑡) = 𝑘(0) 𝑒

−

𝜏
𝑙𝑛(10)
𝜏90 (𝑡)

(6)

where 𝜏 is the mean time between the infection of a material and the contact of this material by an
non-infected person.
Fig. 2A shows a typical k1(t) curve for τ90 ranging from 60 to 250 min, and 𝜏 = 30 min ( 𝜏 can be
modified in the supplementary excel file).

In both graphs, corresponding date is running from left to right. Note that the ARTI risk after a while
strongly diverges from the mono-exponential.

Impact of blood (25(OH)D) concentration.
A meta-analysis of 24 studies reporting the association between 25(OH)D concentration and risk or
severity of acute respiratory track infection (ARTI) during cold or influenza epidemic [3] shows that
the risk follows an power-exponential relation (Fig. 2B).
Assuming that covid-19 risk similarly depends on 25(OH)D concentration and considering this risk
increase as the single effect varying k(t), we get

Studies in Europe[4-8] reported a seasonal 25(OH)D concentration drop of 20-26 % between August
and October (table 1). Two longitudinal studies [6,7] followed one single cohort during 12 months,
with one [7] reporting the 25(OH)D concentration curves for each subjects allowing a rough
estimation of the intra-individual standard deviation, giving a drop of 26 ± 25% in normal subjects
(age 31 ± 3 years).This standard deviation could still be higher in country population regarding the
presence of older, and also of chronically ill, subjects. As a results, more than 15% of European
population could from August to October suffer from a 25(OH)D concentration decrease larger than
50%. Assuming that the COVID-19 risk follows fig. 2B and that the whole population has an initial D =
90 nmol/L value, a rough estimation of the k(t) surge can be computed as(see excel sheet “vitD
severity” S-AA for the numerical integration result):
𝑘 (𝑂𝑐𝑡) =

√2𝜋 23

(𝐷−67)2

−
∫0 𝑘(𝐷) 𝑒 2 × 232 𝑑𝐷 𝑘(𝐴𝑢𝑔) = 1.18 𝑘(𝐴𝑢𝑔)

(8)

In the integral, lim 𝑘(𝐷) = ∞ but due to higher exponent power of the gaussian, i.e. 2, versus that
𝐷→0

of k(D), i.e. 1.6, the integral does not diverge and can even be truncated at D = 0. The integration was
extended above the initial D = 90 nmol/L value, regarding that one patient in the cohort [7] exhibited
a concentration increase rather than a drop.

Discussion:
Many studies support an impact of low 25(OH)D concentration on the respiratory impairment in
coronavirus or virus diseases [9], and also recently for the COVID-19 pandemic (see [10] for a
detailed review and analysis of 14 studies reporting such impact). Low 25(OH)D concentration is also
more prevalent in populations at risk: i.e. aged people [11,12], obese patients [13], coloured skin
people living in high latitude countries [14] and diabetic patients [15].
However by comparing the covid-19 severity between different populations, discriminate whether
the 25(OH)D concentration is a real factor of covid-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness
being the primary severity factor can be challenging.
The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit to be only triggered by a
parameter globally affecting this population. There is no correlation with temperature, nor with
humidity, nor with school opening dates (see excel file), but an impressive latitude correlation (fig. 3).
The remaining common parameter affecting these populations at different times monotonously
depending on the latitude is the sun UV daily dose (fig. 4).
This UV index dependence was already observed for influenza epidemy [16], but also associated with
a temperature dependence. A global seasonality study also evidenced a monthly corelation for other
pre-existing human seasonal coronaviruses activity with temperature and humidity [17]. However,
this study did not consider the latitude as a confounding factor, and on a monthly scale there is a
correlation between temperature-humidity and latitude. On the daily scale used in the present study,
this correlation does not longer exist, each country being temporally affected by different wind
directions. This feature allows to clearly discriminate between temperature-humidity and latitude
impact.
The decreasing sun UV insolation can impact the covid-19 dynamics in two ways: by decreasing the
outdoor sars-cov-2 inactivation or by decreasing the population 25(OH)D concentration.
However, many European countries were able in November to break the surge by additional safety
rules. Activities where people cannot wear the face mask such as collective sport, or such as relaxing
in pubs and restaurants were forbidden, also festive activities where people often forget distancing
recommendations were forbidden. In contrast, population continues their professional and outdoor
relaxing activities wearing the face mask at work, in public transport, in itinerant outdoor markets (an
European use) and in parks. The success of these rules supports the major role of airborne transport
of the sars-cov-2 versus contamination by outdoor infected material contact.
Eq. 6,7 clearly illustrate that the potential impacts on covid-19 dynamics of outdoor sars-cov-2
inactivation and of 25(OH)D concentration decreasing are fundamentally different. Indeed, Fig. 2B
supports that even if the 25(OH)D concentration slowly decreased after the summer solstice, its
impact on the contagiousness becomes more and more important with time and leads the dynamics
to strongly diverge from a mono-exponential after a while, this is in line with the occurring in
October. In contrast, Fig. 2A supports that the impact of the outdoor sars-cov-2 inactivation
decreasing on the covid-19 contagiousness becomes less and less important with time, which should
had correspond to a enhance in July-September, moving towards a doubling time stabilization.
The obtained β/α ratios range from 1.02 to 1.37 (Table 2), this is in line with the estimated ratio 1.18
regarding that eq. 8 neglects any country dependence and was based on a small cohort (n=8) follow
up.

The positive linear slope of the sun UVB threshold versus the country latitude (Fig. 4 ) is also in line
with the fact that, due to the natural adaptation, populations have a more and more pigmented skin
when the latitude decrease. As a result, skin vitamin D production in north populations is affected by
the sun UVB decrease in a slower way than that of the south populations. Fig. 4 is also in line with the
low population mortality observed within ±35° latitudes [18] and reported in Hubei located on the
31° latitude, regarding that these regions are most of the year above the sun UV daily dose 34%
average threshold.
The present study supports thus that low 25(OH)D concentration is well a contributing factor of
COVID-19 severity as already showed by the previous studies [10], which all together constitutes a
convincing bundle of evidence. By increasing the coronavirus load in the respiratory track, the
contagiousness in the population is also increased, starting a chain reaction which explains the wave
surge.

Conclusion:
As already evidenced by previous correlation studies [10], low 25(OH)D concentration should be
considered as a contributing factor of covid-19 severity.
Europe, and north USA as well, are starting this autumn a long covid-19 crisis as they will get back
above the October sun UV daily dose only end 2021 March.
The bet to reduce the pandemic severity during the coming winter using controlled preventive
vitamin D supplementation should be considered [10, 19].
