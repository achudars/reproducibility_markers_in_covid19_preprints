ABSTRACT

3

Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of BAME community

4

leaders in relation to - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their communities; and

5

BAME community’s perception, understanding and adherence to Government guidelines on

6

COVID-19 public health measures.

7

Design: A phenomenological approach was adopted using qualitative semi-structured

8

interviews.

9

Settings: Community organisations and places of worships in the West Midlands region of

10

England.

11

Participants: Community leaders were recruited through organisations representing BAME

12

communities and religious places of worship.

13

Results: A total of 19 participants took part. Participants alluded to historical and structural

14

differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many

15

struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were

16

deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering

17

on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many

18

communities. Many expressed their community’s reluctance to report symptoms for the fear

19

of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was

20

deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials

21

and historical structural biases. Access and adherence to government guidelines was an

22

issue for many due to language and digital barriers. Reinforcement from trusted community

23

and religious leaders encouraged adherence. Points of support such as food banks were

vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford masks and

25

sanitisers.

26

Conclusion: The study highlights the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on BAME

27

communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the

28

community, and community leaders to penetrate the key messages and deliver targeted yet

29

sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing

30

route cause of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME)
communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of BAME community
leaders
43

INTRODUCTION

44

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in March 2020, with over

45

120,000 deaths from the virus in the UK as of February 2021.1 There was early recognition

46

that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups in the UK were disproportionately

47

affected, 2,3 which came to public attention when the first ten doctors who had died from

48

COVID-19 were of BAME origin.4 During the first wave in April 2020, approximately 35% of

49

almost 2,000 intensive care patients for COVID-19 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland

50

were non-White.5 However, BAME groups only constitute 13% of the UK’s population.6

51

Recent estimates suggest that Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Black Caribbean and

52

other Black ethnicity had between 10-50% higher mortality risk compared to the White British

53

population.7

54

Historically, health inequalities have been a concern for BAME groups; for example, disparity

55

has been observed through higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease

56

in South Asian communities.8 The concept is defined as “avoidable and unfair differences”

57

shaped by their surrounding circumstances, namely wider determinants of health.9 Factors

58

such as socio-economic status, cultural practices and environmental conditions –which are

59

largely influenced by structural biases based on ethnicity, collectively drive inequalities.

60

Whilst literature reinforces the understanding that BAME groups are disproportionately

61

affected by COVID-19, there is a lack of research that aims to understand the disparity from

62

the perspectives of BAME communities.

63

Urgency of further study into the association between ethnicity and COVID-19 was

64

highlighted in research and policy domains in early 2020. Data from the Office for National

65

Statistics (ONS) proposed that existing co-morbidities in BAME COVID-19 patients could

66

have contributed towards the disparity.10 However, the debate later incorporated wider social

67

and structural disparities. Factors such as deprivation, living conditions, nature of

68

employment were linked to higher morbidity and mortality in BAME populations.11

69

In addition to the disparities in morbidity and mortality directly as a result of COVID-19,

70

anecdotal media reports have stated that BAME communities have been under protected,

71

stigmatised during this pandemic.12 Currently there is a sparse literature exploring the

72

understanding of BAME groups on how they, themselves, perceive their disparity in COVID-

73

19. To mitigate the pandemic and its impact, diverse information were disseminated through

74

social and broadcast media by the UK Government and public health organisations. Slogans

75

such as ‘Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives’ endeavoured to support the first national

76

lockdown in the UK. During this period, non-essential businesses, community organisations

77

and places of worship, which are integral to many BAME communities, were inaccessible.13

78

Downloadable translations of key documents, including posters for COVID-19 symptoms

79

were made available in England through Public Health England in eleven different

80

languages.14 However, BAME communities’ understanding of pandemic-related

81

communication from the Government and public health organisations has not yet been

82

investigated.

83

The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of BAME community leaders in relation

84

to: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their communities; and BAME community’s

85

perception, understanding and adherence to Government guidelines on COVID-19 public

86

health measures.

91

Leader or representatives of the organisations, businesses and places of worship serving a

92

predominantly BAME community in the West Midlands region of England, a region that

93

suffered most BAME related hospital admissions and mortality, were searched online, then

94

invited via email or telephone. Organisations were identified through internet, social media

95

search and acquaintance of the research team (all representing BAME communities). Those

96

expressing interest were emailed a Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form.

97

Additional recruitment was made through snowball sampling. The ethnic groups of interest

98

(Electronic supplementary material 1) were of those recommended by the UK Government.16

99

Ethical approval and consent

100

Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Birmingham School of Pharmacy Ethics

101

Committee (reference number UoB/SoP/2020-64). Informed consent was received from all

102

participants.

103

Data collection material and methods

104

An interview topic guide (Electronic supplementary material 2) was developed with 19 open-

105

ended questions on three key areas regarding BAME community’s: (1) understanding of

106

acquiring COVID-19 risk and disparity in health outcomes; (2) beliefs and perspectives

107

relating to COVID-19; and (3) understanding and adherence to Government-issued guidance

108

and public health measures on COVID-19. Probes elicited a comprehensive insight from

109

participants. To test face and content validity, the research team developed questions based

110

on existing literature and a pilot interview was conducted with a BAME community member

111

which ensured clarity of the questions. No changes had to be made to the topic guide.

112

Participants were recruited and interviewed between October - November 2020 for

113

approximately 45 minutes over Zoom or telephone. Relevant demographic information was

114

collected prior to the interview. Interviews were audio-recorded using the recording function

115

on Zoom or a digital voice recorder, respectively.

117

Data processing and analysis

118

Recordings were transcribed verbatim into Microsoft Word. Data was anonymised to remove

119

any identifiable information. Transcripts were exported onto Microsoft Excel and then

120

thematically analysed by two researchers (FM and VP) using framework technique.17-19 The

121

initial coding was reviewed between the research team through analysis of first two

122

transcripts before an agreed version that could be applied to the rest of the transcripts. New

123

themes were as they emerged during the subsequent analysis of other transcripts.

124

Reporting was conducted to comply with the COREQ guideline20 and checklist (electronic

125

supplement material 3).

126

Patient and public involvement

127

Apart from members of public’s participation in the research as study subjects, no other PPI

128

activities were conducted for this research due to time and resource constraints.

129

RESULTS

130

A total of 19 participants from various community leadership roles and BAME

131

representations took part (table 1). Four overarching themes and 11 subthemes were

132

identified (tables 2-5). Themes related to a) perceived impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on

133

wellbeing b) understanding of risk and disparity in health outcomes for COVID-19; c)

134

perception, understanding and adherence to Government guidance in relation to COVID-19;

135

d) accessibility and use of community services, and other points of support, during the

136

pandemic. Narrative summaries of each theme are presented below and illustrative quotes

137

are presented in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 dedicated to each theme.

141

Mental health impact and psychological wellbeing

142

This was widely expressed by all participants, with feelings of anxiety being exacerbated by

143

social isolation appearing to culminate in emotional fatigue, owing to the longevity of the

144

pandemic. Participants alluded to the close knit nature of the BAME communities and the

145

pandemic and the lockdown had an immense impact on their social wellbeing. Some also

146

reported that women within families may have suffered a notable impact due to additional

147

strain from domestic responsibilities during lockdown (table 2).

148

Whilst participants differed in their perspectives on whether adequate mental health support

149

was available during and after the first national lockdown, all recognised that further

150

education within their respective communities was required to break the taboo that

151

presented a barrier to expressing emotion, and encourage those who require support to

152

actively seek it. Participants of Asian and Black African communities described that mental

153

health was still deemed a taboo within the communities and many had to suffer in isolation

154

(table 2).

155

Financial impact

156

The subsequent financial impact from the national lockdown was an overriding concern for

157

BAME communities, particularly for those on lower incomes and in self-employment.

158

Financial insecurity as a result of the pandemic was especially difficult for families, as

159

several participants mentioned that many in their communities were reliant on Government

160

welfare (table 2).

161

Physical health impact

162

Current and future physical health was a concern expressed by many participants (table 2).

163

They recognised that their communities are often predisposed to certain chronic conditions

164

which may result in worse outcomes, due to the current treatment prioritisation of COVID-19.

165

Examples described related to the impact on the ongoing treatment of patients with sickle

166

cell anaemia, thalassemia and prostate cancer that were deemed to be highly prevalent

167

amongst Black African communities. Therefore, those with underlying conditions were taking

168

extra precautions to maintain optimum health, should they be affected by COVID-19.

169

Leaders mentioned their community’s fear of being admitted to hospital due to the worry of

170

potentially dying away from loved ones. Mistrust in the health services appeared to be

171

propagated by social media and prior negative experiences in healthcare; this stopped many

172

from self-reporting if they had symptoms (table 2).

173

Social impact

174

Some participants reported an increase in targeted online hate crime, perhaps due to media

175

representation of their community during this pandemic (table 2). The high prevalence of

176

COVID-19 in BAME communities and the media representations have resurfaced historic

177

structural biases against their community, with some commenting strongly on the perceived

178

discrimination. Similarly, leaders noted the perceived lack of support for their respective

179

BAME groups regarding COVID-19 and its effects.

180

Participants also described the taboo within their own communities meant many were

181

suffering in isolation. Many would also be unwilling to report symptoms if it meant that they

182

would have to self-isolate, due to consequent financial loss and, sometimes, stigmatisation

183

from fellow community members (table 2).

184

Leaders expressed their communities’ struggles with restrictions on social distancing and

185

lockdown measures that had greatly impacted on what would otherwise be high-volume

186

cultural and religious gatherings, from festivities to funerals (table 2).

Participants spoke of varying degrees of acceptance, with most describing their communities

accepting their increased risk of transmission, infection and worse health outcomes

192

compared to the White British population. However, scepticism of the virus’s impact was

193

expressed by the participants, particularly due to the disproportionate death toll in the UK

194

compared to their native country (table 3). All mentioned that the greatest health impact was

195

on those who were elderly and vulnerable within their community, including those with

196

underlying health conditions and disabilities (table 3).

197

Perceptions around ethnic, cultural, societal and environmental contexts as risk

198

factors

199

Neighbourhood deprivation was commonly described, with many commenting on poor

200

lifestyles and socioeconomic status fuelling the disparity (table 3). This was linked to

201

education level and employment nature, especially for those in the service sector with high

202

public exposure. Participants discussed multigenerational living contributing towards the high

203

prevalence. For younger generations who were conscious of the risk, it was reported that

204

some may have struggled to communicate this to elders within their family and wider

205

community due to cultural hierarchies (table 3).

208

COVID-19

209

Understanding and clarity

210

Almost all participants stated that Government guidance was inconsistent and lacked clarity.

211

The subsequent effect was worsened for community members who were not fluent in

212

English, with translated guidance lacking in forms that could be accessed and understood by

213

all. This, combined with the community’s close-knit nature, was reported to have perhaps

214

influenced their interpretation of social distancing guidelines between households (table 4).

Poor outreach

216

Digital exclusivity exacerbated weak understanding, with leaders mentioning that the

217

pandemic revealed the lack of digital access for their most deprived (table 4). Participants

218

described how they took on the role of disseminating Government guidance; a common

219

sentiment was that of wonder to how else their community would have received such

220

information without their input. Some mentioned that media representation and comments by

221

Government officials made their community feel marginalised, as it sometimes appeared to

222

be targeted directly towards particular ethnic groups (table 4).

223

Adherence, or lack of, to Government guidance

224

Participants deemed that communities in more deprived areas appearing to have weaker

225

uptake of guidelines. Other risk avoidance behaviours included the use of home remedies,

226

which were perceived to have great benefit and were linked to cultural and religious

227

practices (table 4).

228

Facilitators affecting adherence including personal value, such as being able to resume

229

congregational worship. Reinforcement from local authority and trusted community and

230

religious leaders encouraged adherence. In contrast, the simplicity of some guidelines

231

(wearing face masks and avoiding non-essential travel) appeared to make some question

232

the necessity of abiding by them, especially when Government officials were also seen to

233

publicly break the rules without consequence (table 4).

on inadequate access to General Practitioners, a healthcare professional their community

241

holds in high regard and would usually turn to (table 5).

242

Points of support

243

All commented on their community’s feeling of servitude towards each other during the

244

pandemic (table 5). Family and friends were reported to be the immediate support network.

245

As lockdown restrictions eased, community centres and places of worship were stated to

246

have responded to their local’s needs by launching services, such as food banks and

247

befriending projects, which were not previously required (table 5).

248

Table 5 placeholder

249

DISCUSSION

250

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on BAME

251

communities. The findings reveal the inequalities as experienced by leaders of diverse

252

BAME communities. Participants alluded to the disparities in infection rates and outcomes to

253

historical and structural differences. Many community members experienced racism and

254

stigmatisation during the pandemic. Cultural and social practices within the communities led

255

to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo

256

within many BAME communities.

257

Participants identified their community members faced barriers to adherence to government

258

guidelines. Lack of English proficiency particularly contributed to this. Despite translated

259

documents, there was often an issue of illiteracy in the native language for some community

260

members, with a number of participants mentioning the need for interpreters to verbally

261

deliver guidance. It is known that deliverance of Government guidelines was markedly

262

affected by digital exclusion. In 2019, only 10.6% of White ethnic groups in the West

263

Midlands were found to be “internet non-users”, whilst the collective percentage for all other

264

ethnic groups (as included in our study) was reported at 39.9%.21 In addition, some

265

participants described that lack of access to sanitizers and masks during the early phase of
12

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.03.21252286; this version posted March 3, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

266

the pandemic led to further difficulties in adherence for the most disadvantaged in their

267

community.

268

Stigmatisation of mental health has frequently been documented within BAME communities;

269

this perceived barrier to seeking support from peers or professionals were described by our

270

study participants. Our findings also revealed a mental health impact from the lockdown

271

particularly on women with familial responsibilities in BAME communities. This also

272

extended to the lack of adequate bereavement support. Many communities could not grieve

273

as usual due to lockdown restrictions. For instance, the Muslim community initially could not

274

perform burial rites within 24 hours, an otherwise-expected practice. This was quickly

275

ameliorated by emergency Government legislation which respected the community’s

276

wishes.22 Such practice from authority level should be implemented for other minority ethnic

277

groups regarding the particular challenges their communities face during this pandemic.

278

Participants described overcrowding due to multi-generational living as a risk factor for the

279

observed disparities and contributor to weak adherence of social distancing guidelines.

280

Many alluded to poor housing conditions. The ONS have reported that only 2% of White

281

British households are overcrowded, compared to 10% for other ethnic groups.23 Participants

282

also commented on the nature of employment their community members typically hold,

283

including key worker roles during the pandemic (such as transport operatives and hospital

284

porters) overexposed them to the virus.24 High prevalence of such employment amongst

285

BAME communities have been linked to poorer education levels associated with historic

286

structural biases and systemic inequality. 24This is reiterated by research stating that such

287

factors interplay with ethnicity, resulting in poor health for minority ethnic groups.25

288

Strength and limitations

289

To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate the understanding of risk and impact

290

of COVID-19 using the perspectives of BAME community leaders in England. An extensive

291

variety of community leaders were recruited through an intensive search of BAME

292

community organisations, businesses and places of worship. Thus, key informants could

293

share the experiences of COVID-19 pandemic on their BAME community through the study’s

294

qualitative design. The interviewing-researcher’s own BAME origin may have also allowed

295

participants to openly discuss sensitive issues, thus eliciting detailed perspectives.

296

Duplicate analysis of interviews provided rigour, and data saturation was assumed after 19

297

participants since no new themes had emerged. However, these findings are not

298

representative of all BAME groups. For example, we could not recruit anyone from East

299

Asian communities. Leaders not of BAME origin themselves but who could speak on behalf

300

on BAME communities (such as councillors of White ethnicity representing a West Midlands

301

constituency with a high ethnic demographic) were approached, but we did not receive

302

response from anyone available to participate. Moreover, our methodology’s use of

303

Government-standardised ethnic grouping was very broad, but our results indicated that the

304

experiences of this pandemic varied hugely across different ethnicities that would be classed

305

together. For instance, the Somali diaspora in inner-city Birmingham had very different

306

understanding and experiences of COVID-19 compared to the Caribbean community in

307

outskirt boroughs.

308

Although not an aim of this study, there is weakness in its lack of generalisability as it was

309

limited to a geographical region within England. However, this region represents the second

310

highest proportion of BAME populations within England.26

311

Implications for practice and research

312

Further work needs to be urgently undertaken during this ongoing pandemic to improve

313

adherence to the Government guidelines within BAME communities and mitigate the

314

disproportionate impact of COVID-19. This includes increasing outreach and providing

315

logistical and financial support at a grassroots level to the most vulnerable in already-

316

marginalised communities. Public health guidance must be produced in different languages

317

and dialects through accessible media, not only on how to stay safe from COVID-19 but to

318

also challenge myths propagated by social media. Public health campaigns should

319

incorporate nuances that BAME communities can resonate with, such as the perceived

320

benefit of home remedies, to deliver targeted but culturally sensitive interventions. All

321

aforementioned recommendations should be implemented with cooperation between health

322

services and trusted community networks, religious leaders and local stakeholders. This

323

approach would be beneficial in other global or national public health interventions and any

324

future pandemics, should they occur.

325

Future research could investigate which intra-demographic characteristics within a certain

326

BAME community affect their perceptions and impact of COVID-19, and to what extent. This

327

includes factors identified by this study, such as cultural hierarchies. The collective

328

addressing of all non-White demographics into one overarching BAME category should also

329

be questioned and adapted, as this study has demonstrated that one solution will not

330

encompass the needs of all BAME communities. Perspectives of other population groups

331

who are likely to face multiple social disadvantage during the time of pandemic such as the

332

homeless populations,27-29 refugees30 and single people living31 needs to be researched.

333

CONCLUSION

334

BAME community leader participants of this study alluded to historical and structural

335

differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In addition,

336

cultural and social practices within the communities led to many suffering on their own as

337

discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Racial

338

discriminations added to their worries during the pandemic. Reinforcement from trusted

339

community and religious leaders encouraged adherence to government guidelines. Points of

340

support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic.

341

Government agencies and public health bodies need to integrate with the community, and

342

community leaders to penetrate the key messages and deliver targeted yet sensitive public

343

health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing route cause of

344

disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics. These must be addressed

by using appropriate and targeted public health interventions. Such interventions should be

346

emboldened by the governmental sphere foremost, then perpetuated by local authority in

347

collaboration with community leaders. Ultimately, all strategies must be guided by BAME

348

communities themselves in order to successfully meet their needs.

Illustrative quotes
"in the Asian community… from going to mixing with lots of family then all of a
sudden you might not, that's very hard for people”
P17, Asian/British Asian, school teacher
“the younger ladies… struggled as well…, the kids were at home and they
were saying they’re driving them insane, having to do the home-schooling… all
the cooking, cleaning… school gives that break… They found it initially… very
enjoyable being with the family but with a longer period of time it does get a bit
repetitive, kids become ratty, they become…very frustrated… I remember one
parent saying to me… she found it really exhausting.”
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider
“mental health has a very big stigma in my people…, they don’t talk about
mental health, it’s a cultural thing. Mental health, they’ll tell you, oh my God,
audhu billahi minashaitan [I seek refuge in God from the outcast Satan], …
what you’re talking about, you don’t believe in Allah [God]? … why are you
saying you have a mental health? People will stamp on you… if you say I’m
depressed, you can’t ever say that word. It doesn’t actually… exist in my
language, believe me, I’ve tried to… translate it…, it’s not there…, it’s that bad”
P6, Black African/British Black African, radio presenter
“mental health isn’t really highly regarded in our community… so, we’re trying
to do workshops… to kind of bring awareness of it”
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider
“during coronavirus, … people are… struggling because… the things gone up.
Prices gone high, and their earning gone down. Some people are struggling
paying rent…, struggling in their jobs. For example, taxi drivers.”
P5, Asian/British Asian, mosque imam
“What the Government did which… has impacted… people of African
Caribbean origin, is that… they had a furlough scheme… which they told
everyone… would end in October… Then at the very last minute… announced
that they're gonna [going to]… put the furlough scheme back. But the effect
was, by that time,… there was a lot of unnecessary redundancies… Black
young people are twice… as likely to be unemployed than their White
counterparts. So, they would have been affected by those sort of decisions”
P16, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, community service
provider
“I know people who won’t go outside right now because they’re afraid of
catching the virus because… if you’re BME, you’re more likely to [die] … They
don’t wanna [want to] go to the doctors… Some say they’re not going to
hospital because, again, they were dying in hospital. They left home… not that
sick, and by the time they get there, they die… So they’re fearful of going to
hospital… It’s across… the community”
P11, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, church leader
“Within the African Caribbean community, one of the conditions… is sickle cell
anaemia and thalassemia… Because of the lockdown,… they've been
restricted in terms of the treatment that they can get… Men and prostate
cancer,… it's very high in the African… community. If you’re not able to get a
check-up,… that delay can be fatal, because in African Caribbean men, …
prostate cancer tends to be… a stronger strain… So now,… there's a potential
that people out there have either passed away or moved into stage four when,
if services had been available, they wouldn't have… So… there will be… some
deaths that are unnecessary, really, because of this lockdown”
P16, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, community service
provider
“When somebody dies in the community, we get hundreds of people, it's not
about 15 or 30, it’s hundreds… I think a lot of our cultural norms,… it's like it's
been eradicated, or just taken away... To all of a sudden restrict the amount of
people who can attend church, and then when you're there, … we can’t
worship like… we used to, because we’re quite vocal, we’re very expressive
and all that’s been… taken away”

Fear of
implications
from selfisolation

P18, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, community service
provider

“My community are poor, most of them are… on benefits,… some of them
are… working… low paid jobs, like cleaners… So…if a person is already
worried if they can put food on the table,… they don’t think more about the risk
of what’s happening out there… And… there’s a lot of… single parents in
Birmingham... What will I do to feed my children if the lockdown happens
and… I lost my job? … It’s very difficult when you’re thinking about feeding
your own children and about your health, so you… may go to work… maybe
not feeling well yourself… They were even hiding that they have the COVID-19
symptoms,… because they cannot afford to stay home.”
P6, Black African/British Black African, radio presenter
“people are not… willing to say, oh I’ve got symptoms, cuz [because] of fear
that people are not gonna [going to] come near them, but they would talk about
other people, other stories”
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider

Reinforced
structural
racism and
prejudice

"The heightened awareness of the fact that it's impacting BME [BAME]
communities has given rise to…justifying hate… and we've seen some of this
manifested online towards our community."
P1, Asian/British Asian, community service provider
“Our people have lost a lot of family members through this COVID,… People in
our culture, in our community, felt unappreciated, uncared for, lack of value
placed on them, who they are, and what they’ve accomplished. And even how
they’ve been treated historically, it’s now coming back stronger because
they’re now saying… we were asked to come to this country years ago, we
weren’t coming here by ourselves,… doing other people’s work, come and help
rebuild the country. And now you’ve done all that, they’re treating you as
though you’re nothing but a slave, you’re just…an intruder in this country.”

to] get the virus, you were gonna [going to] get it, and they were
quite reluctant to obey the rules.”
P7, Asian/ British Asian, community service provider
“It's a linkage [the disparity], whether it’s true or not,… especially
when you then compare it to India, … whether the numbers are
wrong or not, accurately counted or whatever,… but the margins
cannot be that much. …It can’t be that India… underreport such
less numbers compared to the UK or mainland Europe,… that it
has somehow… not affected Indians … in India to the same
degree or same level as those in the UK.”
P13, Asian/British Asian, temple manager

Perceptions
around ethnic,
cultural, societal
and
environmental
contexts as risk
factors

Multi-generational
living

“living with extended people, they said that was a risk of infection
spreading… because the White British public,… they’re quite
limited to…their… literal families that they’re living with, whereas
we have extended families."
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider

Education level and
employment

“When you look at… hospitals and health establishments, the
workers there are mainly from the BAME communities, so… they
would be more at risk… because we're the ones… who are on the
front line… to protect people… from COVID.”
P18, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, community
service provider

Neighbourhood
deprivation or
affluency

“The community… believe that… the Government is not doing
enough in time, and sense that there’s a lot of deaths that have
occurred amongst our community,… because they’re the poorer
sectors, … those who live in the… poor housing area”
P11, Black/African/ Caribbean/ British Black, church
leader

Community
collectivism

“I think for lots of communities…., they see your family, our family
as being one family, almost. So they don't differentiate and think,
well actually, it's households”
P14, various BAME groups, community service provider

Poor health and
lifestyle and lack of
access to healthy
food

“Our community, the food is not healthy,… they don't eat
balanced diet…, they don't have physical activities. And… they
have different kind of… diseases like diabetic,
heart…problems…and…cholesterol, and…because of this
they…understand that… we are more vulnerable… compared to
the White community.”
P5, Asian/British Asian, mosque imam

Cultural hierarchy

“We… stay with our grandparents, with our parents…., it’s just a
part of our culture.… The teenagers… understand the risk,… but
what can they do? Who’s in charge of the house? The
grandparents or the parents are in charge…They may come to
them and say, look, mummy or daddy you cannot go and visit that
person who passed away…, because of COVID-19. They [in
charge] say, oh, you are becoming Western, why you not
understanding… it’s our culture? That’s our family… Young
people don’t have… the authority… The adults cannot
understand… what’s the Government saying, what’s the Public
Health England saying. So, they don’t know, they think … they’re
[young people] exaggerating, they’re becoming Western, why are

they telling us not to go? So… young people understands but…
our older ones… don’t,… and that’s where the risk lies because if
they get the infection, young people gets infection because they
live together.”

Illustrative quotes
“The Government kept putting out… very much last minute information…
So…for a lot of parents, if they don't access…mainstream news, then where
do they find out information from?”
P14, various BAME groups, community service provider
“There were lots and lots of mixed messages which… the Government and
local government didn't seize upon quickly enough to try and change that
messaging and adapt so… every community and every family member could
understand it.”
P14, various BAME groups, community service provider
“Some people only had access to computers… if they came to work and they
haven't got computers at home… A lot of the older generation or people on
low incomes, they've got the old-fashioned phones so they can’t go on…
things like Facebook and WhatsApp and… other digital platforms… I think
that… the African Caribbean community and… the dual heritage
community,… in terms of digital inclusion, it's a massive issue. And there's a
lot of digital exclusion”
P19, Black/ African/Caribbean/British Black/White and Black
Caribbean/White and Black African, community service provider
“Interpreting the guidelines, they needed someone to do that because…
they’re not able to read English, they’re not able to dissect that information
and process it. So they needed… somebody who’s British-born
Bangladeshi… or Pakistani…Indian, to… relay that information to them…
They wouldn’t understand the Government guidelines, even when they’re
watching the news,… they wouldn’t fully understand it”
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider
“The Director of Public Health wants to work with African Caribbean,… dual
heritage and BAME communities… in terms of reinforcing the Hands, Face,
Space message… not to just to protect yourself, to protect your family,…
your friends,… the community as a whole… People like ourselves have to
get involved in that campaign… We're the ones that have gotta [got to] get
that message out there because they're not going to listen to people from
outside… their ethnic group.”
P19, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black/White and Black
Caribbean/White and Black African, community service provider
"It’s a double edged sword. On the one hand, the media has been
highlighting the disproportionate impact on the BME [BAME] community. On
the other hand, the way that might have been perceived by some is to say
that…if we have greater interaction with people from BME communities…
then we’re more likely to catch it [COVID-19]. And so then as a result,… stay
away"
P1, Asian/British Asian, community service provider
“You’ve got the elderly… who have come to the UK… in the last… 6 years or
so… they’re not really… listening to the restrictions. At the start, none of
them were wearing masks… however with the… younger British teens that
are in the… Pakistani community, they were following the restrictions…, the
guidelines, and they were… more compliant with the rules, rather than the
elderly”
P9, Asian/British Asian, supermarket manager
“Home remedies are very, very popular within our community,… all the
Sunnahs [practices] of our Prophet peace be upon him… they practice that a
lot…the honey, the dates, the ginger, a lot of people were highly
recommending that… and I think… they take it [Government guidance] very
literally and strictly, so they do follow it… The elderly, they pray at the
mosque, so because that was closed, they were doing it at home”
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider
“Initially we had half and half, we had people that were serious about it and
we had some people that were not serious about it. So what we did as a
church was to educate them and say…, you need to stay safe and you need
to take care of yourself.”
P15, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, church staff

Perceived
necessity,
convenience and
personal value

“A lot of our community have cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, so
that played a significant factor in their risks as well and… some are…
severely ill as… cancer patients…, so… they were quite scared”
P6, Black African/British Black African, radio presenter
"In congregational prayers… there are gaps in the prayers and you have to
take your own prayer mat. People are… abiding by it… When you value
something… like prayer and when it was taken away in that… lockdown…
Now… we've been given back something… important to most of us,… [so]
people are abiding… and understand completely."
P2, Asian/British Asian, school teacher

Behavioural fatigue
due to longevity of
pandemic

“We thought we were gonna [going to] have a two week lockdown, and
then,… it’s gonna [going to] be over. But… once the… initial panic settled,…
people got a bit complacent… with… the distancing, adhering to… the PPE
precautions, they’re… not wearing face masks… It was the initial panic
where… everyone… responded, no one was to be seen, it was really
quiet…, then, I think everyone got a bit relaxed”
P4, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, church staff

Scepticism if public
leaders seen to
disregard rules

“It came to light that ministers were actually breaking those
guidelines…People then thought it was a two-tier system… one rule for the
ministers and one rule for… everybody else. And… when I say everyone
else, I think that people also think that there's a different set of rules for
people… who are more affluent and people… who are… economically…
seen as… deprived”

Points of
support

Thematic
code

Illustrative quotes
“The wider community, they need more support. And I would [suggest]… that
every faith group be given resources they need to get the people that are
qualified… If the right resources are put in there, people will find more easy
to… go to temples, the mosque, synagogue and the church and talk to priest,
or a minister, or a qualified counsellor from that group who can deal with them
based on… their faith and know who they are as a community.”
P11, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, church staff

Family and
friends

“The people that speak English in the household were responsible for the
shopping, whether it be online or actually attending the actual shops and
getting things”
P7, Asian/British Asian, community service provider

Places of
worship and
religious
leaders

“The food bank over the past six months has… been inundated with people
from… the community… We started off a drop-off service as well during the
first lockdown… We also have a counselling service as a listening service…,
people, they just, they wanna [want to] talk”
P10, various BAME groups, mosque imam

Established
community
networks and
centres

“We’ve got networks…, a lot of community organisations across the borough
that's working together. So we share information and information’s gone out in
different languages and… we've got community champions… in the area”
P18, Black/African/Caribbean/British Black, community service
provider

Healthcare
professionals

“9 of 10 people I talk to are having problems to get through to their GPs... The
doctor calls [but they] don’t understand what the doctor is saying… Before the
pandemic, people used to take, like, okay, I’ll take my friend with me… who
says [English] maybe better than me… But on the phone, they can’t… So if
somebody doesn’t speak English, or doesn’t have… anyone at home… who
can speak English… what will they do?”
