Prediction of the Epidemic Peak of Covid19 in Egypt, 2020

2

Abstract

3

Objectives: Since December 2019 a pandemic of new novel coronavirus has started from

4

Wuhan, China, in Egypt, the first case reported on February 14, 2020. In this study we

5

aimed to predict the time of possible peak and simulate the changes could be happen by

6

the social behavior of Egyptians during Ramadan (the holy month).

7
8

Methods: SIR and SEIR compartmental models were used to predict the peak time. We

9

simulated different expected scenarios based to examine their effects on the peak timing.

10

Results: We found that the peak most likely to be in middle of June 2020. Simulating

11

different transmission rate probability and R0 the earliest peak could to be in the May 20

12

and latest one could be in 18 July. The peak shifted much earlier to 11th April 2020

13

without lockdown and other mitigation strategies.

14

Conclusion: Social behaviors of citizens during the holy month will dramatically affect

15

the peak timing. Mitigations strategies and other lockdown measure helped to delay the

16

expected peak.

Introduction

2

The first case of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus was identified in

3

Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in In December 2019 and on 13 January 2020 the

4

first case outside of China was reported in Thailand.1 On 11th March 2020 the World

5

Health Organization named it coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and considered as

6

pandemic.2 The first case appeared in Egypt on 14th February 2020 for a foreigner and

7

fortunately was asymptomatic until 1 st of March 2020 he was the only reported case after

8

that few cases started to appear till 14th March 2020 to reach 110 cumulatively, and then

9

the number of laboratory confirmed cases increased weekly (Table 1) to reach 3490 till

10

April 22, 2020.3

As seen in table 1 the numbers started nearly to double weekly from the fifth week and

15

after closure of schools with partial lockdown the public concerned about the timing of

16

the cases surge. The aim of this study is to predict the time of possible peak and simulate

17

the changes that might happen by the social behavior of Egyptians during Ramadan (the

18

holy month) that will begins on Friday April 24 and ends on Saturday May 23.

19

Ramadan families usually gather especially in first days , children have more activates

20

with each other‚Äôs and everyone leaves work at the same time and need to be in home at

21

the same time ; currently with Covid19 pandemic and partial lock down it‚Äôs challenging

22

to cope with social distancing and Ramadan habits .

Methods:

We tested two models SIR and SEIR models 4 to predict peak timing using data till 17th

Where S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t) represent the susceptible, exposed, infective and removed

16

populations at time t, respectively. Œ≤, …õ and Œ≥ represent the infection rate, the onset rate

17

and the removal rate, respectively. 1/…õ and 1/Œ≥ imply the average incubation period and

18

the average infectious period, respectively. The force of infection (rate of infection per

19

unit time is Œ≤I and Œ≤ denoted the rate of transmission from S to I or effective contact

20

between S and I.5

21

These models based on Euler`s Method: A numerical method for solving differential

22

equations and referred to as a compartment model since it is useful to refer to people

23

moving from one compartment to another.

24

Parameters used in the models based on previous studies assuming average Incubation

25

period = 5 days and so onset rate …õ= 0.2 6, assuming infectious period = 10 day and so

26

removal rate Œ≥=0.1.7 Egypt population (1x108) 8, no one infected at the time (t 0) time step

27

is one day and population remain constant so S¬±E+I+R=1.

Regarding transmission rate (Œ≤) and Basic reproduction number (R 0) researcher depended

on the published data available on GitHub , midas-network 9 , R0 for Egypt as published

For the purpose of simulation different scenario of effective contacts during Ramadan,

different R0 and Œ≤ were used within the range of previous published data available on

Starting from model1 (M1) that represent less effective contact rate than the current

with Œ≤ =0.32 and R0=3.2

Results
Researcher used SIR model with different simulation scenarios to predict peak timing,

16

illustrated in figure1. The earliest of peak could be on May 20, 2020 and latest peak could

17

be July 18, 2020, then applied Applying regression method to estimate the best fitted

18

models with the cumulative data released by MOHP till 17th April, 2020; peak on 15

19

June 2020 is more likely.

The 3rd scenario was estimating the peak time without lockdown and other strategies

based on mobility changes report released by google11 that stated average 50% reduction

in Egypt since the time of lockdown and mitigation strategies. The peak was estimated to

occur on 11th April 2020 but with mitigation strategies and lockdown it was shifted about

69 days to reach June 15, 2020 (figure 2).

Discussion
In this study, by applying the SIR and SEIR compartmental model along with the daily

17

reported cases of Covid19 till 17th April in Egypt; we estimated the peak could be in the

18

middle of June. We hypothesized that the social and contact rate per individual changes

19

in Ramadan (the Holy month) that will start on April 24, 2020 will affect the timing of

20

peak as a result of Increase in Œ≤ (transmission rate). We simulated different situations

21

with different rates of effective contact, transmission rate and R0 consequently; the peak

22

timing changed to reach 20 May, 2020 as earliest one and latest peak could be July 18,

23

2020. These findings was in concordance with the study done by Pearsn et al

reported 10,000 cases could be in 20 May 2020. On the contrast a recent report released

2

by SUTD Data-Driven Innovation Lab

3

on May 20, 2020. Researcher simulated another scenario based on current data to predict

4

the timing of peak without lockdown the peak shifted earlier to be on April 11, 2020; the

5

mitigation strategies helped to delay peak.

6

scenarios based on different values on transmission rate (calculated and estimated) in

7

concordance with

8

affecting disease pandemic is the transmission rate which depend on crowding as it

9

affects amount of contact per individual. The current study used SIR and SEIR models

10

which are too idealistic for modeling COVID-19 through numerical simulation, but it

11

gives an idea about when the COVID-19 cases can surge to.15

12

The study stated long range peak prediction to emphasis the role of social distancing to

13

flatten the curve in concordance with Anderson et al 16.

14

The result suggests that the epidemic of COVID-19 in Egypt would not end so quickly.

15

This might be reliable with the WHO‚Äôs statement on 6 March 2020 that it is a false hope

16

that COVID-19 will disappear in the summer like the flu. 17

17

Limitations

18

This is too idealistic for modeling COVID-19 as the reproduction number (R0) changes

19

overtime but the multiple simulation may overcome this hypothetically for certain time.

20

The deterministic models are not accurate and used to give insight about what will

21

happen to population on average. Study didn‚Äôt estimate the hospitalized number at the

22

surge however the timing of the peak didn‚Äôt affected by the identified cases form the

23

actual infective population.

24
25

Conclusions:
During COVID-19 pandemic it‚Äôs hard to predict the real peak timing however the surge

26

timing will depend mainly on the behavior of citizens towards social distancing and

27

hygiene measures. The mitigation strategies and lockdown in Egypt has a positive effect

28

on the delay of the epidemic peak, giving more time to the health sector to encompass the

29

situation. There is an urgent need for Local and worldwide policy to deal with Covid19

30

that will extend to summer time. Egyptian government should monitor the reported cases

31

daily along with the performance of citizens in the coming month to determine the proper

13

that reported the pandemic will end in Egypt

The current study simulated different

should be treated cautiously as COVID-19 is still unclear.
