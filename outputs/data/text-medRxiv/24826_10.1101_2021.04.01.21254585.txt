Concentration of COVID-19 by socioeconomic determinants in Toronto

ABSTRACT (269/275 words)
Background: Inequities in the burden of COVID-19 observed across Canada suggest
heterogeneity within community transmission.
Objectives: To quantify the magnitude of heterogeneity in the wider community (outside of
long-term care homes) in Toronto, Canada and assess how the magnitude in concentration
evolved over time (January 21 to November 21, 2020).
Design: Retrospective, population-based observational study using surveillance data from
Ontario’s Case and Contact Management system.
Setting: Toronto, Canada.
Participants: Laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 (N=33,992).
Measurements: We generated epidemic curves by SDOH and crude Lorenz curves by
neighbourhoods to visualize inequities in the distribution of COVID-19 cases by social
determinants of health (SDOH) and estimated the crude Gini coefficient. We examined the
correlation between SDOH using Pearson correlation coefficients.
Results: The Gini coefficient of cumulative cases by population size was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.360.47) and were estimated for: household income (0.20, 95%CI: 0.14-0.28); visible minority
(0.21, 95%CI: 0.16-0.28); recent immigration (0.12, 95%CI: 0.09-0.16); suitable housing (0.21,
95%CI: 0.14-0.30); multi-generational households (0.19, 95%CI: 0.15-0.23); and essential
workers (0.28, 95% CI: 0.23-0.34). Most SDOH were highly correlated.
Locally acquired cases were concentrated in higher income neighbourhoods in the early phase of
the epidemic, and then concentrated in lower income neighbourhoods. Mirroring the trajectory of
epidemic curves by income, the Lorenz curve shifted over time from below to above the line of
equality with a similar pattern across SDOH.
Limitations: Study relied on area-based measures of the SDOH and individual case counts of
COVID-19. We cannot infer concentration of cases by specific occupational exposures given
limitation to broad occupational categories.
Conclusion: COVID-19 is increasingly concentrated by SDOH given socioeconomic inequities
and structural racism.

Concentration of COVID-19 by socioeconomic determinants in Toronto

INTRODUCTION
Inequities in the burden of COVID-19 were observed early in Canada(1) and around the
world,(2-4) suggesting that racialized and economically marginalized communities faced
disproportionate risks of acquisition.
Descriptive data suggested a temporal shift in how SARS-COV-2 may have spread through
transmission networks over a short period of time within cities.(5, 6) For example, in the Greater
Toronto Area, Canada, (population over 7 million)(7) the first wave from January to August,
2020 quickly divided into micro-epidemics in congregate settings (e.g., long-term care homes)
and what seemed to be more diffuse spread in the wider community.(6) However, an
examination of cumulative cases suggested considerable heterogeneity within the wider
community with greater risks associated with household size and occupation.(8)
Heterogeneity is an established marker of inequities, with the application of Lorenz curves and
Gini coefficients increasingly used to quantify and compare health inequities(9) in infectious
diseases.(10-12) Health inequities, in turn, represent unmet prevention needs acting as
mechanistic drivers of onward transmission in epidemics.(13, 14) Specifically, observed cases
concentrated within a smaller subset of the population which often indicates disproportionate
risks of onward transmission, whether at the individual-level mediated via higher contact
rates(13, 14) or more commonly, at the network-level such as household density or highexposure occupations.(8, 15)
Gini coefficients have been commonly used in sexually transmitted infections as a measure of
spatial concentration to help identify spatial ‘core-groups’ that experience disproportionate risks
in the context of core-group theory.(10, 11) Core-group theory is based on the premise that if
prevention efforts are not effective within a smaller group of people experiencing very high risks
of both acquisition and onward transmission, the epidemic cannot be controlled (10, 11). In
addition to sexually transmitted infections, Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients have been used
for a range of other health outcomes.(16-19) For example, inequities in longevity over time,(18)
oral health,(17) and premature mortality(20) have been examined against income-levels, and
more recently inequities in health outcomes have been examined across other social
determinants, including unemployment.(16)
The present study’s overarching objective is to improve our understanding of the role of social
determinants in shaping SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Toronto, the largest city and
economic capital of Canada. Specifically, we first quantified the magnitude of heterogeneity in
the wider community (outside of long-term care homes) by comparing the concentration of cases
by area-level social determinants. Second, we assessed how the magnitude in concentration of
COVID-19 cases evolved from January to November, 2020.
METHODS
Study design, setting, and population
We conducted a retrospective, population-based observational study using routinely collected
surveillance data; reported according to the STROBE (reporting of observational studies)
guidelines.(21) The study population comprised the City of Toronto (population 2,731,571).(22)

Concentration of COVID-19 by socioeconomic determinants in Toronto

The study period included cases with a January 21 (first documented case was reported on
January 23, 2020)(23) to November 21, 2020 episode date. The episode date is either the date of
symptom-onset as self-reported by individuals, or the test-submission date in cases where
symptom data are either missing or individuals were asymptomatic.(24) We excluded individuals
residing in long-term care homes because congregate settings represent a different epidemic
setting from the wider community. Our unit of analysis was the census geographic unit of the
dissemination area (DA), which represents on average 400-700 residents.(25)
Data sources
We used Ontario’s Case and Contact Management (CCM+) surveillance system of person-level,
anonymized, surveillance data which includes information on laboratory-confirmed cases by
episode date, reported date, the DA of residence, and demographic, exposure, and settingspecific characteristics (e.g., -long-term care residence). The DA of residence was determined
using the Postal Code Conversion File version-SLI.(26)
For DA-level variables on the social determinants, we used publicly available data from the 2016
Canadian Census,(27) and two variables that were not publicly available: after-tax, per-person
equivalent income ranking across DAs within the Toronto which was obtained from ICES (a notfor-profit research institute that securely houses Ontario’s health-related data); and a measure of
multi-generational households which was curated by and sourced from the Ontario Community
Health Profiles Partnership.(28)
Measures
For social determinants, we considered measures previously shown to be associated with testpositivity;(29) and mechanistically drive transmission dynamics by considering frequency of
contacts and who contacts whom.(30) These include:
(1) socio-demographic indicators that are proxies of economic barriers and systemic racism
(income; % visible minority; % recent immigration);
(2) dwelling-related variables (% suitable housing;(31, 32) % multi-generational households);
and
(3) occupation-related variables (% working in essential services [health; trades, transport and
equipment operation; sales and services; manufacturing and utilities; resources, agriculture, and
production])(33)
Details and definitions for each variable are included in Appendix Table A1.
Analyses
We generated crude Lorenz curves by DA to visualize inequalities in the distribution of
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. Lorenz curves are used to assess the relationship between two
cumulative distributions: the cumulative proportion of diagnoses and the cumulative proportion
of the population. This information can be summarized using the estimated crude Gini
coefficient (the comparison of the cumulative proportion of population against the cumulative

proportion of diagnoses) where a coefficient of zero represents complete equality and one
represent complete inequality. We included all DAs in this analysis, including DAs without
SARS-CoV-2 cases. We excluded cases with missing DA numbers that we were not able to link
to DA level characteristics.
We examined the correlation between social determinants using Pearson correlation
coefficients.(34) To investigate concentration of confirmed cases by social determinants, we
first described the cumulative and daily epidemic curves by each social determinant. We then
generated Lorenz curves using x-axes that represent the proportion of the population ranked by
DA-level estimates of each value of the social determinant and subsequently estimated the crude
Gini coefficient, over the entire study period and for each mutually exclusive time-period using
the dates of large-scale restriction measures in Toronto: January to March 16 (preclosure/shutdown); March 17 to May 18 (during shutdown and prior to stage 1 re-opening); May
19 to June 23 (stage 1); June 24 to July 30 (stage 2); July 31 to October 9 (stage 3); October 10
to November 21 (modified stage-2) (Appendix Table A2).(35) We generated 95% confidence
intervals for the Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients using bootstrapping (9, 11).
All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.2), and spatial maps were generated using ArcGIS
(version 10.7).
Ethics approval
The University of Toronto Health Sciences Research Ethics Board (protocol no. 39253)
approved the study.
RESULTS
Between January 21 and November 21, 2020, there were N=33,992 observed cases of COVID19, excluding long-term care residents (Appendix Figure A1). The median population size of a
DA was 450 (interquartile range, 446-768, Appendix Table A3). Among 3,702 DAs in the City
of Toronto, 404 DAs had zero reported cases, representing 10.9% of DAs and 8.1% of the
population. Data on social determinants were missing in 0.51-0.57% of DAs (Table 1). The
proportion of cases that were travel-acquired decreased over time: from 51% (preclosure/shutdown) to 3% (during shutdown), 1% (stage 1), 5% (stage 2), 3% (stage 3), and 1%
(modified stage-2).
Geographic concentration of cases
The overall Gini coefficient of cumulative cases by population size was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.360.47) (Figure 1A). For example, 53.7% (95% CI: 53.2-54.3%) of cumulative cases were
diagnosed in 25% of the population, with the largest concentration of cases in the north-west part
of the city (Figure 1B) which overlap with the social determinants under study (Appendix
Figure A2).
Distribution and correlation of social determinants
At the DA-level, the median per-person equivalent after-tax income was $45,750 CAD per year;
the median proportion residing in suitable housing was 92.6%; and the median proportion

working in non-health essential services was 38.5% (Table 1). Table A4 shows the values of
each social determinant across deciles.
The correlation matrix of social determinants suggests considerable overlap (Figure 1C). For
example, DAs with the lowest income were correlated with a higher prevalence of essential
services workers (correlation coefficient, -0.58) and, multigenerational households (correlation
coefficient, -0.22), whereas higher-income DAs were correlated with a higher prevalence of
suitable housing (correlation coefficient, 0.51).
Epidemic trajectory by social determinants
The epidemic curve of cumulative cases per 100,000 population, stratified by decile for each
social determinant is shown for one variable from each category (household income, suitable
housing, and essential services) in Figure 2. Results for the remaining three social determinants
are presented in Appendix Figure A3. The daily rates are shown as deciles in Appendix Figure
A4.
COVID-19 was initially concentrated in DAs represented by higher-income households before
moving into lower-income DAs in early April 2020 (Figure 3A, Appendix Figure A4A). For
the period up to May 13, 2020, travel-acquired cases were concentrated in higher-income DAs
(Figure 3B). Locally acquired cases, however, although similarly concentrated in higher income
neighbourhoods in the early phase of the epidemic, shifted concentration into lower income
neighbourhoods (Figure 3C). A similar pattern for other social determinants was observed
(Appendix Figure A5). In September, 2020, with the start of the second wave, there was a
similar and consistent pattern of steeper epidemic curves among lower income neighbourhoods
and slower growth in higher income neighbourhoods - a pattern replicated across the other social
determinants (Appendix Figures A4B-F).
Concentration of cases by social determinants
The Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients of cumulative cases for the whole study period are
shown in Figures 2B, 2D, and 2F; Appendix Figures A3B, A3D, and A3F, and summarized in
Table 1. The largest Gini coefficients were estimated for essential workers (Gini coefficient
0.28, 95% CI: 0.23-0.34).
Mirroring to the trajectory of epidemic curves by income (Figure 2A, Appendix Figure A4A),
the Lorenz curve (Figure 4) shifted over time from below to above the line of equality. The
remainder of the Lorenz curves over time are shown in Appendix Figures A5A-E), and the Gini
over time is summarized in Appendix Figure A6. For example, the Lorenz curve for income
remained below the line of equality in the early period prior the March 16 stay-at-home order
(Gini 0.25, 95% CI: 0.20-0.35) when diagnosed infections were disproportionately concentrated
in higher income neighbourhoods and then consistently above the line of equality thereafter
when cases were disproportionately concentrated in lower income neighbourhoods.
Within each time-period from the first stay-at-home order in March, the magnitude of
concentration remained relatively stable during the stay-at-home orders and during Stage 1
(May-June) and Stage 2 (July-August) re-openings (Appendix Figure A6). However, when the
second wave began in September, there was less heterogeneity across all social determinants

(Appendix Figure A6). The Gini coefficient for income, for example, fell to 0.14 (95% CI:
0.10-0.21) before rapidly concentrating again and increasing to 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13-0.30) by the
time modified restrictions resumed in October.
DISCUSSION
Using metrics of social determinants of health, we quantified increasing inequities in COVID-19
cases over time in Toronto, Canada. We found that there has been a consistent pattern,
established early, of rapid concentration of COVID-19 in small geographic areas. Areas of
Toronto particularly burdened by COVID-19 have lower income, dwellings characterized by
household crowding, and occupations that are not amenable to remote work.
The pattern of early travel-related cases largely concentrated in higher-income and less diverse
communities with fewer essential workers are similar to that observed across the globe.(2, 15,
36-38) We also found that the early, non-travel related cases were in similar neighbourhoods
(i.e., higher income) suggesting a partially assortative (“like mixes with like”) physical network
with respect to income-level and other social determinants. This pattern by income suggests that
early, non-travel cases initially spread within higher-income networks before entering and
spreading in networks represented by lower-income households. There has been limited study of
population-level mixing (or “who has contact with whom”) by income and other social
determinants in the context of acute respiratory infections. For sexually transmitted infections,
network assortativity has been well established within sexual networks. (39) Network
assortativity for COVID-19 may be driven by the overlap between social networks and
transmission networks defined by greater shared airspace and opportunities for transmission
where people live and work. This finding is consistent with data on social networks suggesting
variable degrees of assortativity,(40) with connections between social networks through
occupation - such as caregivers.(41, 42)
The observed pattern of rapid and then persistent concentration of COVID-19 by social
determinants, such as household density for example, has been consistent across high-income
countries(43, 44) and in several low- and middle-income countries as well.(3, 4) Where
reported, occupations not amenable to remote work have also been identified as an important risk
factor for COVID-19.(15) In our study setting, essential services workers intersected with multigenerational households suggesting a connection between workplace exposures and those in
home communities amplified by high rates of transmission within larger households.(45)
These results should be considered in the light of limitations. We relied on area-based measures
of the social determinants of health and thus our findings may be subject to ecological fallacy.
There are two reassuring elements supporting validity of these findings including the use of the
smallest geographical area available (DA) and the congruence of these results with individual
data characterizing race and income among people with COVID-19.(46) We were also limited to
broad categories with respect to occupation, and thus cannot infer concentration of cases by
specific occupational exposures. Finally, these metrics for concentration or inequities are
descriptive and do not independently specify a causal mechanism.
The magnitude and direction of concentration remained relatively stable after March; that is, the
Gini coefficient changed little within each intervention period. The sustained inequities are

consistent with data from the United States,(47) and recently reported in Toronto,(48) which
suggest that mobility-based interventions - such as wide-scale restrictions - are least likely to
reduce mobility in lower-income neighbourhoods.(49, 50) Collectively, workplace mobility and
the Lorenz curves by non-health essential workers suggest mobility-based interventions which
restrict movement may have reached saturation of impact for a subset of the population, well
before the second wave in Toronto. That is, public health measures that intend to keep people at
home (e.g., lockdown or stay at home orders) may have worked on only a subset of the
population and potentially reinforced disparities in COVID-19 among those who could not work
remotely – especially in the absence of workplace-specific occupational health interventions.
There are several implications of the findings for public health. First, findings could be used to
adapt interventions and allocate resources where transmission occurs, geographically and
temporally. An example of this is vaccine allocation based on per-capita risks and not just
population size: i.e. the combination of geography (hence, social determinants) and age when
considering vaccination priorities to allow for the joint probability of acquisition risk and
severity risk when allocating limited vaccination supply in the short-term.(51) Such efforts
would also need to include active, community-tailored efforts to address vaccine confidence/trust
which may be lower in communities most affected by COVID-19;(52) and account for
implementation challenges with neighbourhood-specific vaccine delivery ensuring it is
equitable.(53, 54) Second, the occupational and housing risks identified here may be overcome
with structural interventions such as paid leave, housing supports, and alleviating barriers to
testing and healthcare access. While structural interventions are often considered using a longterm horizon, immediate-term activities that are implemented at scale to those who are most at
risk of acquisition and transmission are feasible and are being implemented in some settings – as
evidenced by community-tailored mobile testing programs and isolation support.(55, 56) These
immediate actions continue to challenge the assumption that tackling social determinants can
only be addressed in the long-term while passive restrictions to reduce mobility are considered
feasible by decision-makers.(57, 58) For example, immediate and actionable measures to control
the spread of an infectious disease can still include active, on-the-ground support for infection
prevention and control in workplaces and systematically removing barriers to sick leave to
support safe, voluntary, and sustainable isolation.(57, 59) Finally, public health agencies and
governments can be called upon to actively measure inequities in their COVID-19 response to
better understand who their interventions are reaching and who they may be leaving behind.(60)
CONCLUSIONS
In sum, there was a rapid epidemiologic transition in COVID-19 from an epidemic concentrated
among higher income communities in Toronto related to travel to local transmission in lower
income communities secondary to structural risks including structural racism often defining
where people work and how they live. Similar to other infectious diseases the findings of marked
inequities in COVID-19 burden in Toronto presented here suggests the existence of core-groups
concentrated by social determinants of health. Specifically, these data characterized ‘coregroups’ that may be spatially-distributed, but whose underlying social determinants of health
define the fundamental sources of heterogeneity in risks. Taken together, these findings suggest
the added benefit of resource-based interventions to better address the specific needs of higher
risk communities and thus reducing inequities in outcomes as has been advocated for by the local
public health agencies.(61) Moreover, the inequities in the burden of COVID-19 appear to be

sustained in the context of non-adaptive population-wide intervention strategies potentially
secondary to the differential impact in reducing contact rates based on household density and
occupation. Taken together, these results from Toronto suggest the potential impact of an
equity-lens to inform resource-based policies and programs to optimize both the equity and
effectiveness of COVID-19 intervention strategies.

Figure 1. Concentration of COVID-19 cases by proportion of population in the City of Toronto, Canada (January
21 to November 21, 2020). In Panel A, the Lorenz curve depicts the cumulative proportion of laboratory-confirmed
diagnoses, excluding residents of LTCH, by the cumulative proportion of the population by dissemination-area. The
dashed line represents the line of equality. For example, 53.7% (95% CI: 53.2%-54.3%) of cases were diagnosed among
25% of the population as shown by the dashed horizontal and vertical red lines. Panel B shows the map of lowest to
highest deciles with respect to laboratory-confirmed diagnoses per capita by dissemination-area for the City of Toronto
public health unit; and excluding cases among LTCH residents. Panel C depicts a heat map of the correlation between
social determinants at the dissemination area, where 1 represents a perfect positive correlation and -1 represents a perfect
negative correlation.

Concentration of COVID-19 by socioeconomic determinants in Toronto

Figure 2. Cumulative epidemic curve and cumulative Lorenz curve by three social determinants (income, suitable
housing, and essential services). Panels A and B represent income (after-tax, per-person equivalent) deciles where the
lowest decile (decile 1) represents the lowest income decile and decile 10 represents the highest income decile. Panels C
and D represent suitable housing deciles where the lowest decile (decile 1) represents areas with the highest proportion of
homes deemed suitable housing;(27) and the highest decile (decile 10) represents areas with the lowest proportion of
homes deemed suitable housing.(27) Panels E and F represent essential services where the lowest decile represents DAs
with the fewest essential workers and the highest decile (decile 10) represents the highest prevalence of individuals
employed in essential services. The Lorenz curves (Panels B, D and F) depict the concentration of cases by each
determinant and the dashed line represents the line of equality; for example, 30% of the population residing in the lowest
income areas account for 42.7% (95% CI: 42.2%-43.3%) of cumulative cases (Panel B). The time-periods are: (a) March
17, 2020, start of shutdown; (b) May 14, 2020, start of stage 1 re-opening; (c) June 24, 2020, start of stage 2 re-opening;

Figure 4. Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient of COVID-19 cases over time by income in Toronto, Canada (January
21, 2020 to November 21, 2020). The dashed line is the line of equality. The coloured solid lines represent the time
periods associated with the stages of intervention: prior to shutdown (January 21, 2020 to March 16, 2020); during
shutdown (March 17, 2020 to May 13, 2020); stage 1 re-opening (May 14, 2020 to June 23, 2020); stage 2 re-opening
(June 24, 2020 to July 30, 2020); stage 3 re-opening (July 31, 2020 to October 9, 2020); and modified stage 2 re-opening
(October 10, 2020 to November 21, 2020). Income values described are per-person equivalent and after-tax. The number
of cases were initially disproportionately lower in neighbourhoods of lower income (light pink) before quickly
concentrating in higher income neighbourhoods. There was less heterogeneity at the beginning of the second wave in
Stage 3 (dark blue), but the epidemic concentrated again quickly by neighbourhood level income by the modified stage 2
(dark pink).
