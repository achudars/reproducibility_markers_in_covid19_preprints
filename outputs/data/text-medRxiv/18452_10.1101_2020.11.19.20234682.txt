effective vaccines and also on high levels of uptake by the public over time. Addressing questions
of population-level acceptability, stability of acceptance and sub-population variation in
acceptability are imperative. Using a prospective design, a repeated measures two-wave online
survey was conducted to assess key sociodemographic variables and intention to accept a
COVID-19 vaccine. The first survey (time 1) was completed by 3436 people during the period of
national lockdown in Scotland and the second survey (n = 2016) was completed two months later
(time 2) when restrictions had been eased. At time one, 74% reported being willing to receive a
COVID-19 vaccine. Logistic regression analyses showed that there were clear sociodemographic
differences in intention to accept a vaccine for COVID-19 with intention being higher in
participants of white ethnicity in comparison to Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) groups,
and in those with higher income levels and higher education levels. Intention was also higher in
those who were ‘shielding’ due to underlying medical conditions. Our results suggest that future
interventions such as mass media and social marketing need to be targeted to a range of
sub-populations and diverse communities.

Vaccination will be vitally important in controlling future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite uncertainty regarding the specifics of many of the potential vaccines (e.g. efficacy and
required doses), it is clear that high levels of overall public acceptance will be required. In recent
years, vaccination rates have fallen and public confidence in vaccines is inconsistent [1-4]. The term
‘vaccine hesitancy’ refers to the ‘delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of
vaccine services’ [5, 6]. The reasons for vaccine hesitancy are multi-levelled and complex, involving
psychological, social and contextual factors [7-9]. Vaccine hesitancy was evident during the H1NI
pandemic, which saw variable vaccine uptake, with non-uptake related to concerns about vaccine
safety and perceptions of threat and risk [10-14]. Preliminary evidence from the current pandemic
suggests that a sizable proportion of the public are currently either undecided or unwilling to
receive a future vaccine for COVID-19 [15-20]. The importance of high levels of uptake was
demonstrated in a recent study which suggests that in order to “extinguish an ongoing epidemic”,
the efficacy of a vaccine as the sole intervention needs to be at least 80% when uptake is at 75%. If
uptake is lower than this then an even more efficacious vaccine would be needed [21].
A recent global survey from Ipsos MORI [18], conducted in July and August 2020, of 20,000
adults from 27 countries found that 74% of people would get a vaccine if it was available. However,

only 37% strongly agree that they would want to get it, while 37% somewhat agree. Large variations
in acceptance levels were also shown across countries, ranging from 97% in China, to 54% in Russia.
The primary reason that people gave for not wanting to accept the vaccine was worry about the side
effects, followed by concern about the effectiveness of a vaccine, and not feeling at risk of contracting
COVID-19 [18].
Emerging research also suggests that particular sub-populations have lower acceptance
intentions. In France, during late March 2020, 26% of the sample reported that they would not accept
a vaccine. COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was more prevalent in those with low income, young
women, and among older adults aged 75+, and it was associated with political views [19]. In
Australia, more positive views were reported in April shortly after the introduction of lockdown,
with 4.9% stating they would not get the vaccine, and 9.4% stating indifference. Here, COVID-19
vaccination hesitancy was associated with lower education levels and health literacy, and the belief
that the threat of COVID-19 had been exaggerated [20]. A study conducted two months later in
Australia, when restrictions had been eased, found that those who were unwilling or unsure about
accepting a COVID-19 vaccine had increased by 10% [16], suggesting that COVID-19 vaccination
levels may fluctuate depending on the context of infection rates and restrictions. A further study
from the US reports an acceptance level of 67% and found that acceptance levels were lower in
unemployed participants and in Black American participants [17].
Together, these initial studies suggest that COVID-19 vaccine acceptance differs both across
countries and in different sub-populations within countries. The research to-date has been based on
cross-sectional designs and has not yet explored how intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine may
change in line with rates of infection or lockdown restrictions within the same sample. We explored
this question of intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 in a prospective survey in Scotland at two
time points (during national lockdown and during the easing of restrictions). The present study has
three key research questions (RQs):
RQ1: What proportion of people would accept a vaccine for COVID-19?
RQ2: Is COVID-19 vaccine acceptance stable over time in the context of different infection levels
and restrictions?
RQ3: What socio-demographic factors are associated with intention to accept a future vaccine
for COVID-19?

The present study consisted of an online survey at two time points. The first survey (time one)
was conducted during lockdown restrictions (20th May- 12th June 2020, weeks 9-12 of national
lockdown). The second survey (time two) was conducted two months later (during August 2020)
when lockdown restrictions in Scotland had been eased and there was little community transmission.
Ethical approval was received from the University of Strathclyde Ethics Committee (Ref:
61/05/05/2020/A Williams) prior to commencement of the study. The data reported here are part of
the larger CATALYST project which examined the changes that people had experienced during
lockdown.

For time one, participants were recruited with convenience sampling through advertisements
on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, which directed participants to Qualtrics where
they could access the online questionnaire. Included in the survey for time one was an information
sheet and consent form which participants read and signed before completing the survey. For time
two, participants were re-contacted via email and provided with a Qualtrics link to the online
questionnaire, inviting them to take part at time two.

Participants provided self-reported sociodemographic and health data at time one for the
following variables: age (18-49, 50+); gender (female, male); ethnicity (white, BAME); annual
household income (<£16,000, £16,000 – £29,999, £30,000 - £59,999, £60,000+); level of education (no
qualifications/left school at 16, high school/college, university) and risk group/shielding status (i.e.
those who had been classified as high risk based on underlying health conditions or age) (yes/no).

Intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was measured by self-report at time one and again at
time two. Participants were asked “If a vaccine for Coronavirus (Covid-19) becomes available,
would you want to receive it?” and provided response options “I definitely would not want to receive
it”, “I probably would not want to receive it”, “Unsure”, “I probably would want to receive it” and “I
definitely would want to receive it”.

The COVID-19 vaccination intention response options of “I definitely would not want to receive
it”, “I probably would not want to receive it”, and “Unsure” were coded as “Vaccine Hesitant” and
the options “I probably would want to receive it” and “I definitely would want to receive it” were
coded as “Vaccine Willing” to create dichotomous “willing” versus “hesitant” variables. Frequency
responses to the vaccination intention questions were calculated (RQ1). In addition, a McNemar’s
test was used to examine any changes in vaccine willingness across the two time points from
lockdown (time 1) to the easing of restrictions (time 2) for those participants who completed the
survey at both time points (RQ2). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were
carried out to examine the socio-demographic factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination
intention at time 1 (we selected time 1 intention as the dependent variable in order to maximise
sample size) (RQ3). Due to issues relating to the representativeness of our sample and specifically
the under-representation of males and those with lower levels of educational attainment (as shown
in Table 1), we carried out post-stratification weighting of these variables based on the Scottish
census data to correct for these imbalances. All of the analyses that we report are based on this
weighed data in order to allow for greater extrapolation of the results to the Scottish population. All
analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25) at 5% significant levels.

Overall, 3436 participants (79% female) residing in Scotland, aged over 18, were recruited for
the current study. The sample was comprised of participants aged between 18 and 92 (M = 46.21, SD
= 15.26). Of the original sample, 2016 participants took part at time 2, representing a 59% follow-up
rate. We compared the socio-demographic characteristics of those who participated in both waves of
the survey with those who dropped out. There were no significant differences between the
completers are non-completers based on ethnicity, income, or high risk status but the groups did
differ significantly on education level, gender, and age with higher dropout in those with lower
education levels, males, and in the younger age group. Participant socio-demographic characteristics
from time one and time two from our original sample (not weighted) are shown in Table 1.

A frequency analysis of the proportion of participants that reported willingness and hesitancy
to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across the two time points are shown in Table 2. At time 1, 74% of
participants were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and at time 2 this figure was slightly higher
at 78% (note that the numbers reported in Table 2 for the ‘vaccine hesitant’ and ‘vaccine willing’
rows are based on the total sample, whereas the other numbers in the table are based upon only
those participants who completed the questionnaire at both time points).

Table 2 presents the results relating to stability of COVID-19 vaccination intention for those
participants who completed the questionnaire at both time points. McNemar’s test on these
participants showed that there had been a significant shift in vaccine intention over time, (p=.004). Of
the 54 participants who reported that they definitely would not want vaccinated at time 1, 13 (24.1%)
reported that they would now accept the vaccine at time 2. Of the 79 who reported that they
probably would not want the vaccine at time 1, 12 of them (15.2%) would now accept the vaccine at
time 2. Of the 301 who were unsure, 113 (37.5%) reported at time 2 that they would now accept the
vaccine. Of the 904 people who initially would definitely want to be vaccinated, 20 (2.2%) would
now not take it, and 10 (1.1%) were now unsure. In addition, of the 498 who initially probably would
receive it, 13 would now not take it (2.6%) and 72 are now unsure (14.5%).

As shown in Table 3, univariate logistic regression analyses showed that there was a significant
effect of age, ethnicity, education level, household income and high risk/shielding status on
intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. There was no effect of gender on intention to accept a
COVID-19 vaccine. In relation to age, younger participants reported higher levels of intention than
those in the older age group. We also found that participants of white ethnicity had higher levels of
intention than those from BAME groups. In relation to education, those with higher levels of
education had higher levels of intention to receive the vaccine. In addition, those with higher levels
of annual household income had higher intention levels than those with lower income levels. Finally,
those participants at high risk or in the shielding category had higher levels of intention than those
not in this group.

For the multivariate logistic regression we entered those variables that were significant in the
univariate analysis (i.e. age, ethnicity, education, household income, and high risk/shielding).
Ethnicity, education, household income and high risk remained significantly associated with
intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the multivariate analysis, but age was no longer
significant. When considering the coefficients (see Table 4), those participants of white ethnicity are
almost three times as likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those from BAME groups.
Similarly, those from the highest education group are two and a half times more likely than those
from the lowest education group to accept it, and those in the highest income group are 1.82 times
more likely to accept the vaccine compared to those in the lowest income group. In addition,
those in a high risk/shielding group are almost twice as likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine
compared to those not in a high risk/shielding group.

The present study is the first to examine intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in Scotland.
The study also extends existing research that has examined acceptance levels in other countries by
adopting a prospective design, allowing us to examine stability in vaccine intentions over time
within the same sample. We found that 74% of the sample at time 1 intended to receive a COVID-19
vaccine (during the period of national lockdown). Interestingly, two-months later, intention levels
had shifted significantly. The greatest shift in intention levels was apparent in the group who were
“Unsure” at time one, with 38% of those participants now saying they would accept a vaccine. The
second survey was carried out when restrictions had been eased and there was little transmission of
COVID-19, it is therefore notable that intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was still high at this
time. Stability in intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination will be particularly important given
that two doses of the vaccine are likely to be needed over time.

Our findings suggest that although the majority of respondents in Scotland indicated that they
would want to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, there is a sizable minority of the public who were
hesitant about receiving a vaccine, mirroring the overall picture that is emerging from other
countries. Indeed, the intention levels reported here are similar to those emerging globally from the
recent Ipsos survey in which 74% of people overall said they would get a COVID-19 vaccine [18].
We also found that intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccination varied by sub-population. There
was a significant effect of ethnicity, education level, household income and high risk/shielding status
on intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Of particular note, those of white ethnicity are nearly
three times as likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those from BAME groups, those
from the highest education group are two and a half times more likely than those from the lowest
education group to accept it, and those in the highest income group are almost twice as likely to
accept the vaccine compared to those in the lowest income group.
Overall, those most at risk of the negative sequalae of COVID-19 had less intentions to get
vaccinated than those at lower risk [22]. For example, intention was higher in participants of white
ethnicity in comparison to BAME groups. However, it should be noted that this binary approach to
looking at differences in ethnicity is problematic, as it may mask important differences between
diverse racialised and minoritised communities with distinct cultures and social norms. We also
found that intentions for vaccination were higher in those with higher levels of income, again raising
questions about why those most likely to suffer the negative consequences of COVID-19 would be
the least likely to intend to vaccinate. These findings fit with the emerging literature on COVID-19
vaccine acceptance which suggests that those from BAME groups may be less likely to accept a
vaccine [17] and that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is more prevalent in those with lower income [19].
If these inequalities in intention translate into uptake then these findings are very important as they
suggest the likelihood that vaccination programmes, unless implemented with targeted and tailored
interventions to enhance vaccination rates, may actually amplify existing inequalities. More
positively, intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine was higher among those who were shielding (i.e.
those who had been classified as high risk based on underlying health conditions or age).
Together, these initial studies highlight the need for government and public health bodies to
think carefully about how to approach their publics with further demands for behavioural change
(i.e., uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine). The findings here suggest, for example, that a ‘one size fits all’
approach to mass media interventions represents at best a partial solution to increasing vaccination
uptake and at worst, a solution that backfires, amplifying existing inequalities. These findings
suggest that future interventions need to be targeted to a range of sub-populations and diverse
communities [23, 24]. The range of interventions should offer different kinds of educational,
persuasive or enabling approaches [25] to different groups of people and there is growing
recognition that such interventions should be co-produced. Issues of visual cultural representation,
identifiable local key opinion leaders, readability and reading levels, and trust will all be important
considerations. These emerging findings also lend themselves to considering the wider
opportunities to targeting afforded by social media. Whilst marketing and politics are capitalising on
these new opportunities, it is less clear if and how public health can do so. Equally these initial
findings also suggest that health care professionals should be trained to anticipate and respond to
diverse segments of the population differently with overt and inclusive demonstrations of cultural
competencies.
If we imagine a future of targeted interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake, it is
also important to focus now on the granularity of messaging that will shortly be needed. Whilst
evidence is emerging concerning where and amongst whom interventions need to be targeted, it is
currently unclear how intervention content should be tailored to these populations and communities
and their particular beliefs. We need to use the full range of social and behavioural sciences now to
address this key gap and ensure that we are prepared and ready to support the whole population in
gaining maximum benefit from available vaccines. One preliminary study in this area used the
Behaviour Change Wheel [26-28] to provide recommendations for the design of interventions aimed
at maximising public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. The findings suggested that interventions

should utilise the behaviour change techniques [29] of information about health, emotional, social
and environmental consequences, and salience of consequences in order to provide the public with
information about the beneficial consequences for themselves and for others [30]. Further, more
in-depth research like this which focuses on intervention development is required.
Strengths of the current study include the large sample size, the use of two waves of data
collection to examine stability in COVID-19 vaccination intention and the inclusion of a range of
sociodemographic factors to allow us to understand the social patterning of COVID-19 vaccination
acceptance. However, it is important to note that the study is not nationally representative, and
weighting was applied to the gender and education variables due to the under-representation of
males and those with lower levels of education. Furthermore, we experienced a participant
drop-out rate of 41% from time one to time two meaning that we cannot draw any conclusions about
the change in COVID-19 vaccination intention in those participants who were lost at follow-up.
Moreover, we experienced higher dropout in those with lower education levels, males, and in the
younger age group. In addition, participants were answering about their intention to accept a
hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine, without information regarding the specifics of the vaccine in terms
of number of doses needed, potential side-effects, or prioritisation of delivery across the population.
All of which may influence eventual uptake of a COVID-19 vaccination.

Intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine is currently high in Scotland and our findings suggest
that intention to receive the vaccine did not fall in the context of lower infection rates and fewer
restrictions. However, the data also point to a sizable minority of the public who are hesitant about
receiving a future COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, intention was higher in participants of white ethnicity
in comparison to those from BAME groups, and in those with higher levels of income and education.
Our findings and those from other studies suggest that future interventions need to be targeted to a
range of sub-populations and diverse communities. To do so, we need to better understand the
barriers to vaccination in these groups so that we can collectively be better prepared to deliver
appropriate evidence-based culturally and community-appropriate messaging aimed at maximising
COVID-19 vaccine uptake.
