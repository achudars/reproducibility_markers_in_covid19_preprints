ABSTRACT
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are associated with
age. While children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARSCoV-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) similar to Kawasaki’s disease. Here,
we show distinct antibody (Ab) responses in children with MIS-C compared to adults with severe
COVID-19 causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and those who recovered from mild
disease. There was a reduced breadth and specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in MIS-C
patients compared to the COVID patient groups; MIS-C predominantly generated IgG Abs specific for
the Spike (S) protein but not for the nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the COVID-19 cohorts had anti-S
IgG, IgM and IgA Abs, as well as anti-N IgG Abs. Moreover, MIS-C patients had reduced neutralizing
activity compared to both COVID-19 cohorts, indicating a reduced protective serological response.
These results suggest a distinct infection course and immune response in children and adults who
develop severe disease, with implications for optimizing treatments based on symptom and age.

Main text
A new clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified in children,
designated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), characterized by a systemic
inflammatory response with similarities to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome but lacking
respiratory illness that is a hallmark of COVID-19 in adults1,2. The nature of the immune response in
MIS-C relative to the more common forms of COVID-19 is not well understood. The generation of
virus-specific antibodies which neutralize or block infectivity is the most consistent correlate of
protective immunity for multiple infections and vaccines3,4. Antibodies specific for the Spike (S) protein
of SARS-Cov-2 which binds the cellular receptor for viral entry, have been detected in actively infected
patients and in patients with mild disease who recovered5-8. Anti-S antibodies can exhibit neutralizing
activity and are currently being pursued as a therapeutic option for infusion into patients during severe
disease and for targeted generation in vaccines9-11 12.
In this study, we investigated the specificity and functionality of the antibody response and its
protective capacity in three patient cohorts seen at New York Presbyterian hospital during the height of
the pandemic from March-June, 2020 1,10,13,14, including patients with mild COVID-19 respiratory
disease who recovered and were recruited as convalescent plasma donors (CPD), hospitalized patients
with the severest form of respiratory disease (COVID-ARDS), and a cohort of children hospitalized with
MIS-C (See Table 1 for clinical characteristics). The COVID-19 patient cohorts represented a broad age
range (14-84 years) while MIS-C ages were younger (4-17yrs) (Table 1). Co-morbidities were relatively
common in adult subjects with COVID-ARDS, but not in MIS-C. Samples were obtained from
hospitalized patients within 24-36hrs of being admitted or intubated, which represented a shorter time
post-symptom onset in MIS-C compared to COVID ARDS patients, respectively. Both MIS-C and
COVID-ARDS subjects exhibited markers of systemic inflammation including highly elevated levels of

IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), while ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were significantly
increased in COVID-ARDS compared to MIS-C subjects (Table 1). None of the MIS-C subjects
developed respiratory failure or ARDS, and had reduced overall organ damage when compared to the
COVID ARDS group, indicating distinct inflammatory and systemic responses in these two disease
manifestations.
We initially established that MIS-C and COVID-19 in our patients are associated with a specific
immune response to SARS-CoV-2, by testing binding of plasma IgG to recombinant S proteins
expressed on the cell surface. Plasma from all patient samples but not pre-pandemic control samples
bound SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the common circulating D614G S protein variant15 but not to S
protein from SARS-CoV-1 or MERS coronaviruses (Extended Data, Fig. 1). We then quantitated the Ab
response in each cohort in terms of specificity and Ab class, including IgM generated initially in a
primary response and IgG and IgA classes prominent in serum and secretions, respectively. Anti-S
antibodies of the IgM, IgG and IgA classes were significantly elevated in COVID and CPD donors
relative to negative control plasma obtained from pre-pandemic samples; COVID-ARDS patients had
the highest levels of anti-S Abs for all classes (Fig. 1a-c). By contrast, anti-S antibodies in patients with
MIS-C were predominantly IgG and to a lesser extent IgA—both at similar levels as the CPD donors
while anti-S IgM levels in MIS-C were at the same low level as negative control plasma (Fig. 1a-c, left).
Moreover, the ratio of anti-S IgG to IgM was significantly higher in MIS-C patients compared to the
COVID-ARDS and CPD subjects (MIS-C anti-S IgG/IgM ratio 3.35 vs COVID ARDS 1.48, p<0.0001
and vs CPD 1.95, p=0.001) indicating skewed production of anti-S IgG in MIS-C. No significant
correlation was found between any of the anti-S Ig isotypes and patient age (Fig. 1a-c, right).
We also assessed the presence of antibodies specific for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)
protein, which complexes with viral RNA, and is involved in viral replication during active infection16.

The MIS-C group showed significantly lower anti-N IgG levels compared to both the COVID ARDS
and CPD groups (Fig. 1d, left). In addition, a significant correlation of anti-N IgG levels with subject
age was observed within the CPD group but not the COVID ARDS and MIS-C groups (Fig. 1d, right).
These results show that MIS-C patients generate mostly anti-S IgG antibodies, while COVID-19 adult
patient groups had a broader antibody response in terms of isotype and specificities with COVID ARDS
patients exhibiting the highest titers and antibody levels of all patient groups.
The ability of antibodies to provide protection is correlated with their neutralizing activity in
blocking virus infection. We developed a cell-based pseudovirus assay based on a system previously
reported17,18 in which multi-cycle infection of RFP-expressing Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein is measured in the presence of serially diluted plasma samples
(see methods). We validated this assay in two ways: First, we compared neutralizing activity of plasma
samples tested in the pseudovirus assay to activity measured in live virus microneutralization assay
based on inhibition of cytopathic effect19, and found a direct correlation in neutralizing activity
calculated from the pseudovirus and live virus assay over a wide range of neutralizing activity (r2=0.54,
slope=0.95, p=0.0044) (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Second, we compared neutralizing activity of samples
with known anti-S IgG positivity by ELISA (n=18) to samples that tested negative (n=30), and found
significantly increased neutralizing activity in the ELISA-positive compared to ELISA-negative samples
(Fig. S1), demonstrating both specificity and sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay.
We measured SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in the different patient groups using the
pseudovirus assay. Overall, the CPD and COVID ARDS plasma samples exhibited greater neutralizing
activity compared to plasma from MIS-C patients (Fig. 2a); plasma from COVID ARDS patients show
the highest neutralizing potency of the three groups across the dilution series (Extended Data Fig. 2b).
Within the MIS-C group, 4/15 (26.7%) patients had neutralizing activity > 2 SD above the mean of

negative controls compared to 11/19 (57.9%) in the CPD group and 13/14 (92.9%) in the COVID ARDS
group. These variations in neutralizing activity between groups did not correlate with patient age (Fig.
2b). MIS-C patients also maintained the same levels of anti-S IgG and neutralizing activity 2-4 weeks
after hospital discharge based on paired analysis of the follow-up compared to the retested primary
sample in 10/15 (66.7%) of the patients (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that the distinct SARS-CoV-2
antibody profile in MIS-C remains stable during recovery.
Only a small fraction of antibodies raised against viral antigens will have neutralizing activity
against the virus, which correlates with protective capacity20. By linear regression, there was significant
correlation between the level of anti-S IgG and neutralizing activity within each group, albeit with a
lower elevation and y intercept for MIS-C group relative to the COVID-ARDS and CPD groups (Fig.
2d). Comparing the ratio of plasma neutralizing activity to anti-S IgG level (Neu:IgG) for each sample
reveals a significantly higher Neu:IgG for the CPD group compared to the MIS-C and COVID ARDS
groups Fig. 2e). This analysis suggests that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response in the most
critically ill patients was less targeted to protection. It remains to be determined whether the distinct
serological responses observed in the MIS-C patients is a characteristic of the pediatric immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 or specific for this syndrome. Plasma samples from a large cohort of
otherwise healthy children who recovered uneventfully from SARS-CoV-2 infection could not be
obtained due to restrictions on clinical research needed to slow the spread of the pandemic. Comparison
of samples from 3 pediatric COVID, non-MIS-C patients - two of which had pre-existing hematologic or
oncologic disease - showed similar anti-S IgG and neutralizing activity to the follow-up samples from
recovered MIS-C patients (Table S1).
Our results show clear quantitative and qualitative differences in the functional SARS-CoV-2specific antibody response in children with MIS-C compared to adults with mild and severe COVID-19.

Children with MIS-C showed the least extensive antibody response that was largely limited to IgG antiS antibodies with the lowest overall level of neutralizing activity, while patients with the most severe
form of COVID ARDS had the highest overall levels and breadth of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies and
the highest overall neutralizing activity. Despite MIS-C patients having the shortest interval among the
groups between symptom onset and sample collection, their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response is
strongly biased towards IgG vs IgM production, suggesting that MIS-C may arise during a late stage
after initial infection.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus and as such, both adults and children lack adaptive immunologic
memory and are experiencing primary exposures. The less robust antibody response in children with
MIS-C could result from a less productive infection in children, also supported by the lack of anti-Nspecific antibodies in MIS-C that requires lysis of virally infected cells. Interestingly, we found that
among the CPD group, there was an age-dependence in production of anti-N antibodies, indicating that
reduced anti-N antibodies may be a feature of infection in younger individuals. While a small cohort of
non-MIS-C patients showed a similar Ab response as MIS-C, studies in larger cohorts of healthy
children who were exposed to or developed COVID-19 are needed to assess the pediatric immune
response to SARS-CoV-2. The presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of
recovered and COVID-ARDS adult patients has been recently reported21,22, though the protective
capacity of these T cells is unclear. For respiratory viruses, T cells which localize and establish
residency in the lung mediate protective immunity, as shown in mouse models23-25. Because younger
individuals have increased number of naïve T cells in different sites to respond to new pathogens26, it is
possible that a robust T cell response efficaciously clears infection in the lung preventing severe
respiratory disease in children, and a low level, persistent infection in other sites may build up over time

in some children, resulting in MIS-C. Other direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 on immune activation has
also been proposed 27.
Current therapeutic options for severe COVID-19 disease have included convalescent plasma,
anti-inflammatory immune modulators, and antivirals. The mainstay of treatment for MIS-C subjects has
been steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions, largely deriving from experience in
children with Kawasaki syndrome1,2. Our results showing inefficient neutralizing activity of the MIS-C
antibody response suggest that targeted treatment of these children with functionally neutralizing antiSARS-CoV-2 neutralizing products should be considered as a therapeutic option in MIS-C28,29. The
continued pursuit of additional therapeutic modalities remains crucial while awaiting an effective
vaccine.

METHODS
Subjects
We recruited a total of 48 subjects from the Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital of New York and
Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital (CUIMC/NYP) who
represented 3 distinct clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals (n=19) donating
blood as part of our institution’s convalescent plasma trial (convalescent plasma donors, CPD) following
a history of recent illness consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequently found to have SARSCoV-2 antibody positive serology. Patients with severe COVID-19 and ARDS (n=14) who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Pediatric patient with MIS-C (n=15) and
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive serology. ARDS was defined by clinical consensus criteria;
including infiltrates on chest radiograph and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300, or pediatric criteria
equivalent 30,31. MIS-C was defined using the Center for Disease Control definition; <21 years of age,
fever >38°C for >24 hours, laboratory evidence of inflammation, hospital admission, multisystem
involvement, no alternative plausible diagnosis, and positive SARS-Cov-2 serology32. Subjects less than
21 years of age recruited in the inpatient setting were assigned to COVID-ARDS vs MIS-C group
following review of their charts by specialists in adult and pediatric critical care medicine. Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated on all subjects using previously validated
adult and pediatric score tools to provide additional clinical insight into subject disease severity33-35.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Irving Medical
Center. Written consent was obtained from CPD subjects. Due to the limitations placed on direct contact
with infected subjects and a need to conserve personal protective equipment, verbal informed consent
was obtained from surrogates of critically ill COVID-ARDS subjects and verbal parental consent was
obtained for MIS-C subjects.

Sample Processing
Blood samples were obtained at time of outpatient donation for CPD subjects, at time of admission for
MIS-C subjects, and following diagnosis of ARDS for COVID-ARDS patients. Plasma was isolated
from whole blood via centrifugation. Aliquots were frozen at -80˚C prior to analysis.
Cell-based Assay for viral Spike protein reactivity
HEK293T cells were transfected with full length, codon optimized S-protein from SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV-2 D614G variant, MERS, SARS-CoV-1 or empty pCAGGS control vector (Epoch Life Science,
Sugar Land, TX). Transfected cells were seeded onto 96 well plates (40,000 cells/well), cultured at
37°C, 5% CO2 overnight, and heat-inactivated plasma samples were added for 30 minutes on ice,
followed by washing with cold PBS and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were then
stained with protein G Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) followed by fluorescence image acquisition using the IN Cell Analyzer 2500 HS
high content analysis imaging system (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA). Image analysis was performed using
ImageJ 36.
Purification of SARS-CoV2 viral proteins
The ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer37 was cloned into mammalian expression vector
pCAGGS (Addgene, Watertown, MA), with a foldon tag followed by 6xHis tag and Strep tag II at the
C-terminal. This expression vector was transiently transfected into HEK293F cells and the spike trimer
secreted in the supernatant was purified 3-5 days post transfection by metal affinity chromatography
using an Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) was cloned into pET28a(+)
vector (Millipore-Sigma, Burlington, MA) with an AAALE linker and 6xHis tag at the C-terminal. The
NP construct was then used to transform into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and the target protein was

produced and purified from the bacterial lysate by metal affinity chromatography using an Ni-NTA
(Qiagen) column, followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of virus-specific antibodies
SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer and N were coated on 96 well ELISA plates at 4℃ overnight, and unbound
proteins were then removed washing with PBS, following by blocking with PBS/3% non-fat dry milk.
Plasma samples were serially diluted in PBST (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) + 10% bovine calf serum
starting with 1:100, and five successive four-fold dilutions into each well of the coated plate which was
incubated at 37℃ for 1hr, followed by washing 6 times with PBST. Peroxidase affiniPure goat antihuman IgG (H+L) antibody, anti-human IgM antibody (Jackson Immune Research, New Grove, PA), or
anti-human IgA antibody (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA) was subsequently added into each well and
incubated for 1hr at 37℃, washed and TMB substrate (Sigma, St. Louis) was added and the reaction
was stopped using 1M sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and expressed as an optical
density, or OD450 value. Identical serial dilutions were performed for all samples with no missing
titrations.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay
We adapted a pseudovirus-based neutralization strategy we previously developed to measure inhibition
of infection by high biocontainment enveloped viruses in a large number of samples under low-level
biocontainment 17,18. For this assay, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is pseudotyped onto recombinant vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses red fluorescent protein (RFP) but does not express the VSV
attachment protein, G (VSV-ΔG-RFP). Initially, VSV-ΔG-RFP pseudotyped with VSV G is used to
infect 293T (human kidney epithelial) cells that were co-transfected with full length codon optimized
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (Epoch Life Science, Sugar Land, TX), the viral entry receptor ACE2 (Epoch
Life Science, Sugar Land, TX) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Infected HEK293T cells are then

mixed at a 2 to 1 ratio with Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells which have high endogenous
expression of ACE238. The cells are then combined with diluted serum or plasma in 96 well plates.
During the assay, infected, S protein- expressing HEK293T cells generate VSV-ΔG-RFP viruses that
bear S protein which subsequently infects and drives RFP expression in Vero cells and undergo multiple
cycles of entry and budding in the HEK293T cells due to the co-expression of S protein with ACE2. The
GFP and RFP signals are measured 24-48hrs after plating (Infinite M1000 PRO microplate reader,
Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland), resulting in robust amplification of the S protein pseudovirus-driven
RFP signal between 24-48hr. Inhibition of RFP signal amplification indicates S protein neutralizing
activity in patient plasma (Figure S1). Identical, five-fold serial dilutions were performed for all samples
and there were no missing titration data points for any of the samples.
SARS-CoV-2 viral stock production
SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020) was kindly provided to BH by World Reference Center
for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) (Galveston Texas, USA). To generate virus stocks,
Vero E6 cells (kindly provided by Dr. F.-L. Cosset) were inoculated with virus at a MOI of 0.01. The
virus-containing medium was harvested at 72hrs post infection, clarified by low-speed centrifugation,
aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. Virus stock was quantified by limiting dilution plaque assay on Vero E6
cells as described39,40.
Live virus neutralization assay
Two-fold dilutions of plasma in 50µL of Dulbecco`s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) were incubated
with 200 plaque forming unit (pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 in 50µL of DMEM for 30min at 4°C. 100µL of
DMEM 4%FBS containing 4x104 Vero E6 cells were added on the top of the former mix in order to
have final dilution of sera from 1:50 to 1:6400 (4 wells per dilution). Cells were then incubated for 3
days at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cytopathic effect was revealed by crystal violet staining, and scored by an

observer blinded to the study design and sample identity. Neutralization end point titers were expressed
as the value of the last serum dilution that completely inhibited virus-induced cytopathic effect.
Quantitation of antibody titrations in ELISA and neutralization assays
For quantitation of neutralization titers in the pseudovirus assay, RFP signal driven by the pseudovirus
normalized to the GFP signal derived from the SARS-Cov-2 S protein and ACE2 transfected cells was
measured at 24 and 48hr; the ratio of normalized RFP at 48 hours (RFP48) to normalized RFP at 24
hours (RFP24) was calculated. This ratio provides a read-out of multicycle infection of the S
protein/ACE2 transfected cell monolayer by S protein-bearing pseudoviruses. Heatmaps of this ratio at
all titrations for all samples were generated using the Python data visualization library, seaborn41.
Neutralizing activity for each sample was calculated by taking the sum of the reciprocal of the
RFP48/RFP24 ratio at all 6 plasma dilutions for each sample as described42, and also by percent
inhibition of multicycle replication at each dilution calculated based on the RFP48/RFP24 ratio of the
sample, control wells of maximal multicycle replication without inhibition (MAX) and control wells
with 100% inhibition of multicycle replication using a lipidated SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide
(MIN)40,43,44. The equation for % inhibition of multicycle replication: 100 X (1-(sample- MAX)/( MAX
– MIN)).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was performed using Prism 8 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Comparisons
of clinical data between groups was performed using the Mann–Whitney U test. Comparisons of
antibody levels and neutralization activity were performed using one-way Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Correlation analysis was performed using simple
linear regression.

Figure 1. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in MIS-C compared to severe and mild COVID-19 disease. Levels of
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were assessed using serial dilutions of patient plasma in an
indirect ELISA assay to detect anti-S IgM (a), anti-S IgG (b). anti-S IgA (c) and anti-N IgG (d). Shown (left) is the absorbance sum
across 6 serial 1:4 plasma dilutions from patients with COVID-19-related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C,
white circles, n=15); patients with COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (COVID ARDS, red triangles, n=14)
convalescent plasma donors (CPD, black squares, n=19), and control plasma from pre-pandemic donors (grey triangles; Neg,
n=8). ±IQR. P value as calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Shown (right) are subject antibody
levels plotted against patient age with the best fit line and p value as calculated using simple linear regression.

Figure 2. Reduced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity associated with MIS-C compared to severe and mild disease independent of age. a, b Neutralizing activity for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was determined using a pseudovirus assay in which
multi-cycle replication of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing viruses was tested in the presence of
4 serial 1:5 dilutions of patient plasma. (see methods). For each sample, neutralizing activity is calculated based on the inhibition of
RFP signal across dilutions. Shown is a heat map (a, left) of the normalized RFP signal across plasma titrations from patients with
MIS-C (white bar, n=15); COVID ARDS (red bar, n=13), convalescent plasma donors (CPD, black bar, n=19), and control plasma
from pre-pandemic donors (grey bar; Neg, n=8). The sum of the reciprocal values at the dilutions are shown (a, right) compiled from
each of the patient and control groups. ±IQR. P value as calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.
These values are also plotted against patient age (b) with the best fit line and P values calculated using simple linear regression. c,
The neutralizing activity and anti-S IgG levels of MIS-C patients (n=10) during the acute phase of illness and at a follow-up visit 2-4
weeks after hospital discharge. P value as calculated by paired t-test. d, The anti-S IgG absorbance sums were plotted against
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity from patients with MIS-C (white circles, n=15, r2=0.5); COVID ARDS (red triangles, n=13, , r2=0.29)
and CPD (black squares, n=19, r2=0.29). Best fit lines, r2values, P values and Y-intercepts as calculated by simple linear regression.
e, The ratio of the neutralizing activity to anti-S IgG level for patients in each group is compiled. ±IQR. P value as calculated by

Extended data figure 2. a, Plasma neutralizing activity in the pseudovirus assay was correlated with the end point titers in a live
virus microneutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effect (see methods). b, Using the results of the pseudovirus
neutralization assay, the percent inhibition of S protein mediated multicycle replication was calculated for each patient plasma
sample across all dilutions (see methods). Shown (b) are the percent inhibition values plotted against the plasma dilution factors
in patients with MIS-C (white circles, n=15); patients with COVID ARDS (red triangles, n=14); convalescent plasma donors (CPD,
black squares, n=19), and control plasma from pre-pandemic donors (grey triangles; Neg, n=8).

Figure S1. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in sera previousy tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibodies by ELISA.
The pseudovirus-based assay was used to assess neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in sera that tested positive and
negative for anti-S protein antibodies by ELISA. For each sample, neutralization activity is calculated based on inhibition of the
pseudoviurs-driven RFP signal (see Figure 2 and methods). Shown is a heat map (left) of the normalized RFP signal across
plasma titrations from de-identified patient samples that were sent to the clinical lab for ELISA-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody
testing and were found to be positive for anti-S IgG by ELISA (black bar, n=18); and negative for anti-S IgG (white bar, n=30). The
sum of the reciprocal values at the dilutions are shown (right) compiled from each of the groups. ±IQR. P value as calculated by
Student’s t-test.
