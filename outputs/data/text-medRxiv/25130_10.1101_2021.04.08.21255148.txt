Abstract (294 words)
Importance: Alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonists (α1-blockers) can abrogate pro-inflammatory
cytokines and may improve outcomes among patients with respiratory infections. Repurposing readily
available drugs such as α1-blockers could augment the medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Objective: To evaluate the association between α1-blocker exposure and COVID-19 mortality
Design: Real-world evidence study
Setting: Patient level data with 32,355 records tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the Mount Sinai Health System
including 8,442 laboratory-confirmed cases extracted from five member hospitals in the New York City
metropolitan area.
Participants: 2,627 men aged 45 or older admitted with COVID-19 between February 24 and May 31,
2020
Exposures: α1-blocker use as an outpatient or while admitted for COVID-19
Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality
Results: Men exposed to α1-blockers (N=436) were older (median age 73 vs. 64 years, P<0.001) and
more likely to have comorbidities than unexposed men (N=2,191). Overall, 758 (28.9%) patients died in
hospital, 1,589 (60.5%) were discharged, and 280 (10.7%) were still hospitalized as of May 31, 2020.
Outpatient exposure to α1-blockers was not associated with COVID-19 hospital outcomes, though there
was a trend towards significance (OR 0.749, 95% CI 0.527-1.064; P=0.106). Conversely, inpatient use of
α1-blockers was independently associated with improved in-hospital mortality in both multivariable
logistic (OR 0.633, 95% CI 0.434-0.921; P=0.017) and Cox regression analyses (HR 0.721, 95% CI
0.572-0.908; P=0.006) adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, and baseline vitals and labs.
Age-stratified analyses suggested greater benefit from inpatient α1-blocker use among younger age
groups: Age 45-65 OR 0.384, 95% CI 0.164-0.896 (P=0.027); Age 55-75 OR 0.511, 95% CI 0.297-0.880
(P=0.015); Age 65-89 OR 0.810, 95% CI 0.509-1.289 (P=0.374).
Conclusions and Relevance: Inpatient α1-blocker use was independently associated with improved
COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized men. Clinical trials to assess the therapeutic value of α1blockers in COVID-19 are warranted.

Introduction
Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been linked to dysregulated immune responses,
including an overexuberant inflammatory response marked by high levels of proinflammatory cytokines
such as interleukin-6 (IL-6).1,2 Immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids have become a standard
component of treatment for severe COVID-19,3 and several trials of anti-cytokine or anti-inflammatory
agents are underway or have reported promising results.4–10 Despite these advances, there remains a
pressing need for safe, effective, and widely available therapeutic options.
Adrenergic signaling has been linked to hyperinflammation in models of bacterial sepsis and cytokine
release syndrome. In pre-clinical experiments, a positive feedback loop of adrenergic signaling was
identified wherein macrophages responded to catecholamines by producing more catecholamines and
inflammatory cytokines; this adrenergic loop could be interrupted by blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors
with prazosin.11 In a retrospective clinical study of patients with acute respiratory distress and pneumonia,
exposure to α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists (α1-blockers) was associated with a significant reduction in
risk of mechanical ventilation or death.12 Similarly, a recent retrospective analysis of 25,130 patients with
COVID-19 across the United States Veterans Health Administration hospital system showed that
outpatient exposure to any α1-blocker was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality compared to
matched controls not on any α1-blocker at the time of hospital admission.13
These observations have led to the hypothesis that α1-blockers in routine clinical use (e.g. prazosin,
doxazosin, tamsulosin, etc.) may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment.14 We therefore conducted this
real-world evidence study based on electronic medical record (EMR) data to determine whether exposure
to α1-blockers is independently associated with mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Methods
Data sources
This retrospective study utilized de-identified electronic medical record (EMR; Epic systems, Verona,
WI) data from 5 member hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in the New York City
metropolitan area. De-identified EMR data were obtained via the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse
(https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/msdw/). We identified 8,442 MSHS patients with PCR confirmed diagnosis
of COVID-19 from February 24 through May 31, 2020 during the peak of pandemic in NYC. COVID-19
was diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based clinical tests
from nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

We retrieved patient demographics, social history, medication history, and disease comorbidities from the
EMR including age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, human
immunodeficient virus (HIV) infection, cancer, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure,
chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic nonalcoholic liver disease, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Patients aged
≥ 89 years were assigned an age of 89 to prevent re-identification. Medications by prescription or
hospital administration captured in EMR from January 1, 2019 till May 31, 2020 were included in the
medication history. We identified disease comorbidities through their corresponding ICD-10-CM codes
before hospital admission and during hospitalization.
We also extracted data from each hospital encounter, including vital sign and laboratory data at the time
of presentation, and medications administered during hospitalization. Vital sign and laboratory data
extracted included: white blood cell count (WBC), serum creatinine, anion gap, potassium, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), body mass index (BMI), temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory
rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
We defined three possible outcomes for each hospitalization: in-hospital death (deceased), discharged to
home or other locations not associated with acute medical care (recovered), and continued hospitalization
(right censored). The duration of hospitalization was calculated from the beginning of the hospital
encounter till death or discharge.
This study was approved by the Mount Sinai institutional review board (IRB): IRB-17-01245.
Study design
This was a retrospective EMR-based study designed to test the independent association of α1-blocker
exposure with in-hospital death among COVID-19 patients. We first identified 6,218 inpatients positive
for COVID-19 in one of 5 hospital systems within the MSHS as of May 31, 2020 (Figure 1). The majority
(93%) of α1-blocker users in this cohort were men aged 45 or older. We therefore limited the analysis
cohort to men aged 45 or older (N=2,627).
We defined α1-blocker exposure as an active prescription from January 1, 2020 for an α1-blocker
(tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin, terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin) up to and including hospitalization
for COVID-19 (N=436). We further defined a subset of patients (N=343) with documented α1-blocker
administration during their hospitalization, which we defined as “α1-blocker inpatient use”.

Potential confounders in the analysis included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, baseline labs
and vitals, and exposure to medications used to treat hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation.
Detailed medication names included in these categories are shown in supplement Table S1.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables
or mean and standard deviation (SD). We displayed categorical variables as number and percentage (%).
We performed a statistical test of hypothesis for differences using the Kruskal-Wallis test or two sample ttest for continuous variables, and the c2 test for categorical variables.
We employed multivariate logistic regression models with potential confounders to estimate the odds
ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (deceased=1) versus
recovery (recovered=0) associated with α1-blocker use. We considered the following potential
confounders: age, hospital stay duration, race, smoking status, BMI, temperature, O2 saturation, heart
rate, respiratory rate, hypertension, asthma, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, diabetes mellitus,
chronic kidney disease, HIV, cancer, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic viral
hepatitis, liver disease, AKI, ICU stay, WBC, creatinine, anion gap, potassium, and ALT. We applied the
Wald-based power and sample size formulas for logistic regression to calculate the power given the
observed sample size.15 We used two-tailed test to estimate the probability of event under the null
hypothesis which was the in-hospital mortality rate and we used the binomial distribution for α1-blocker
with the prescription rate as the probability.
To account for right-censored patients (N=280), we used multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to
evaluate the association between α1-blockers and survival (in-hospital mortality). We estimated the hazard
ratio of α1-blockers on COVID-19 patient in-hospital survival, adjusting for the same confounders
mentioned above.
We utilized propensity score weighting to adjust the potential confounders between those exposed or
unexposed to α1-blockers. We utilized the R package ‘twang’ and calculated the propensity scores based
on average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov evaluation criterion. We then
employed the ‘survey’ R package by fitting logistic regression models with propensity scores as the
weights to assess the α1-blocker treatment effect on COVID-19 patients.
Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P-value < 0.05, unless otherwise noted.

To evaluate the robustness of the associations between α1-blockers and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality,
we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the impact from potential unmeasured or uncontrolled
confounding. We calculated E-values for odds and hazard ratios as point estimates, in addition to Evalues for their upper confidence limits.16 The point estimates represent the strength of unmeasured or
uncontrolled confounding required to explain away the observed associations. The upper limits signify the
strength of unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding needed to move the confidence interval to include
the null, i.e. OR=1 or HR=1. If the effect of unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding is weaker than the
calculated E-value, the association of α1-blockers with COVID-19 in-hospital mortality could not be fully
biased by a weaker confounder.
Results
Patient characteristics and outcomes
We identified 6,218 inpatients positive for COVID-19 admitted to one of 5 hospitals within the MSHS as
of May 31, 2020. Among these 6,218 patients, 464 patients (7.5%) had been prescribed α1-blockers
between January 1, 2020 up to and including their hospitalization, with at least 2 months prior to
admission; most of these patients were men aged 45 or older (N=436, 93%). Therefore, we limited the
analysis cohort to men aged 45 years or older (N=2,627). This cohort was divided into an α1-blockerexposed group (N=436) and an unexposed group (N=2,191). All patients in the α1-blocker group had been
prescribed α1-blockers at some point from January 1, 2020 up to and including their COVID-19
hospitalization (“α1-blocker exposure”); a subset of these patients (N=343) had documented α1-blocker
administration during their hospitalization (“inpatient α1-blocker use”).
The α1-blocker exposed group was older (median age 73 vs. 64 years, P<0.001) and more likely to have
comorbidities than the unexposed group. Chronic diseases such as COPD, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were significantly enriched in the α1blocker group. Additional patient demographics for the two groups are shown in Table 1 and Figure S1.
Overall, 758 (28.9%) patients died, 1,589 (60.5%) were discharged, and 280 (10.7%) were still
hospitalized as of May 31, 2020. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was 32.3% in the exposed group and
28.2% in the unexposed group.
α1-blocker exposure and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality
We evaluated the association of α1-blockers on COVID-19 patients with known outcomes (death: N=758;
discharge: N=1,589) using multivariate logistic-regression models. In the overall population, α1-blocker
exposure was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 0.749; 95% CI, 0.527-1.064;

P=0.106) with the power b = 0.62 based on the sample size of 2347. There was a trend towards a
protective association for α1-blocker exposure in the subset of patients who were hospitalized for at least
24 hours, though this was not significant (N=2,276; OR 0.722; 95% CI, 0.505-1.034; P=0.075) (Table 2).
This might be due to limited sample size (b = 0.71 in the Wald-based power analysis).
To account for right-censored patients (N=280), we used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the
association of α1-blocker exposure and COVID-19 in-hospital survival. There was a trend towards a
protective effect of α1-blocker exposure in the overall cohort (HR 0.808; 95% CI, 0.652-1.002; P=0.052)
and among those hospitalized for at least 24 hours (HR 0.823; 95% CI, 0.660-1.027; P=0.085), though
these associations were not significant (Table 3).
Inpatient α1-blocker use and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality
We further assessed the impact of α1-blockers on mortality for patients with documented administration
of α1-blockers while admitted to the hospital (N=343) compared to unexposed patients. We observed that
inpatient α1-blocker use significantly reduced the risk of in-hospital mortality overall (OR 0.633; 95% CI
0.434-0.921; P=0.017) and among those hospitalized for at least 24 hours (OR 0.607; 95% CI, 0.4150.890; P=0.01) (Table 2).
The survival analysis also showed improved in-hospital survival for those with inpatient α1-blocker use
overall (HR 0.721; 95% CI, 0.572-0.908; P=0.006), and among patients hospitalized for at least 24 hours
(HR 0.751; 95% CI, 0.593-0.950; P=0.017) (Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis
We assessed the impact of potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding on the observed
associations between inpatient α1-blockers use and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality using the E-value
metric (Table S2).16 Based on this analysis, an unmeasured confounder would have to have an odds ratio
of at least 1.25 (in the logistic regression analysis) or a hazard ratio of at least 1.34 (in the survival
analysis) to cause the 95% confidence interval for the treatment effect of inpatient α1-blockers use to
include the null.
Age-stratified associations of α1-blockers and COVID-19 in-hospital mortality
We assessed the interaction between age and inpatient α1-blocker use for overall cohort and patients with
hospital stay > 1 day, respectively, and we did not find any significance between the interaction and inhospital mortality. Therefore, to identify differences in the treatment effect of α1-blockers on different age
groups, we segmented the population into three age groups (45-65; 55-75; 65-89) and analyzed each

group separately using logistic regression, adjusting for the same covariates as the unstratified analysis.
The age groups were overlapped by 10 years to preserve sample size. Inpatient α1-blocker use was
associated with a significantly lower risk of in-hospital mortality in the 45-65 (OR 0.384; 95% CI 0.1640.896; P=0.027) and 55-75 age groups (OR 0.511; 95% CI 0.297-0.880; P=0.015), but not the 65-89 age
group (OR 0.810; 95% CI 0.509-1.289; P=0.374) (Table 4).
Propensity score analysis
We further assessed the effect of α1-blockers on in-hospital mortality using propensity-weighted logistic
regression. These yielded similar results as the multivariable regression and age-stratified analyses.
Inpatient α1-blocker use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (OR 0.630; 95% CI 0.4240.935; P=0.022) whereas α1-blocker exposure was not (OR 0.740; 95% CI 0.512-1.070; P=0.110) (Table
S3). In age-stratified analyses, patients in younger age groups had greater benefit from α1-blocker
exposure and inpatient α1-blocker use than patients in the oldest age group (Table 4).
Discussion
Using a racially and ethnically diverse cohort from New York City comprising 2,627 men aged 45 or
older hospitalized COVID-19 patients seen between February 24 and March 31, 2020, we found that
inpatient use of α1-blockers was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, whereas
outpatient exposures were not associated with benefit, although there was a trend towards significance. In
age stratification analysis, we found that α1-blocker use was more beneficial to younger age groups.
Drug repurposing is the process of finding new indications for drugs already in clinical use. The appeal of
rapidly validating and deploying an existing drug against a deadly global pandemic is clear, especially if
the drug is widely available and affordable. Dexamethasone, now a standard in COVID-19 treatment, is
an example of a commonly used drug repurposed for a new indication.3 However, the saga of
hydroxychloroquine, which was touted as a cure early in the pandemic but has since proven ineffective, is
a cautionary tale.17 The allure of rapid drug repurposing must be balanced against rigorous scientific
method.
α1-blockers, commonly used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension, have become a target
for drug repurposing due to pre-clinical data linking α1-adrenergic signaling to pro-inflammatory
cytokines which may contribute to dysregulated immunity and adverse outcomes in COVID-19.1,2,11
These pre-clinical findings have been bolstered by recent retrospective clinical analyses linking α1blockers with improved outcomes in hospitalized patients with both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
respiratory infections.12,13 In a large COVID-19 cohort drawn from the US Veterans Health

Administration hospital system, outpatient α1-blocker exposure was associated with a relative risk
reduction of 18% for in-hospital mortality compared to matched controls.13 Interestingly, the nonselective α1-blocker doxazosin, which inhibits all three α1-adrenergic receptor subtypes (α1A, α1B, α1D), was
associated with a greater relative risk reduction (74%) than the uroselective (α1A, α1D) α1-blocker
tamsulosin (18%).
In the present study, we found that in-hospital use of α1-blockers was consistently and independently
associated with reduced in-hospital mortality using both multivariable regression and propensity scorebased methods. In age-stratified analyses, we observed that this protective effect was more pronounced in
relatively younger age groups. In contrast to the studies by Koenecke et al. and Rose et al., which defined
α1-blocker exposure based on outpatient prescriptions only, we were able to use inpatient medication
administration records to identify patients treated with α1-blockers during their COVID-19
hospitalization. These results lend additional support the hypothesis that α1-blockers may have a
beneficial effect in COVID-19.
Our results also include tests of association between other common medication classes and COVID-19
outcomes, including beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEi) inhibitors, angiotensin II
receptor blockers (ARBs), and glucocorticoids. Results pertaining to these other medications should be
taken in the context of a selected cohort designed to study α1-blocker use and COVID-19 outcomes.
Exposures to these other classes were not ascertained with the same granularity as they were for the
primary exposure. That said, it is interesting to note that α1-blocker and beta blocker exposure were
associated with opposite COVID-19 outcomes in our cohort. There is evidence to suggest that βadrenergic signaling can promote an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in macrophages, in contrast to the
pro-inflammatory effect of α1-adrenergic signaling.11,18 Additional efforts to dissect the interactions
between adrenergic signaling and the COVID-19 immune response are warranted. A prior diagnosis of
asthma was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in this analysis. While this observation deserves
further scrutiny, it is conceivable that early exposure to inhaled glucocorticoids or β-adrenergic agonists
may have contributed to this signal.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. The cohort did not include women since most α1-blockers were
prescribed to men, most likely for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Male sex is a recognized risk factor for
adverse COVID-19 outcomes, possibly due to sex-specific differences in immunity.19 Thus, these results
may not extrapolate to women. We did not account for different types of α1-blockers, which differentially
target the three α1-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Importantly, a causal relationship cannot be definitively

established between α1-blockers and improved COVID-19 outcomes in this retrospective study. Several
confounders, such as older age and comorbidities were more common in the α1-blocker group. However,
these adverse risk factors would be expected to bias the study result towards the null rather than inflate a
protective association. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with prior data, and were robust to
different methods of adjustment for confounding and sensitivity analysis. The ongoing randomized
clinical trial of prazosin against placebo among hospitalized COVID-19 patients (NCT04365257) will
include women and provide more definitive data on the therapeutic value of α1-blockers. Finally, our
study is based on a single center EMR and medication via outpatient use cannot be tracked for adherence.
Therefore, analyzing in-hospital medication administration is more robust. Furthermore, EMR in MSHS
is the one of the largest and most comprehensive EMR systems, representing racial/ethnic diversity in
New York City, and EMR implementation is from various data sources, so our findings are supported by
large patient cohort and were robust from applying multiple methods of adjustment for confounding.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this retrospective study found a protective association between α1-blockers use and
COVID-19 outcomes in a cohort of hospitalized men. These results augment the rationale for studying
and repurposing α1-blockers as a COVID-19 therapeutic. We await the results of the ongoing randomized
clinical trial.
