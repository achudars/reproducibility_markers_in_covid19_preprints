Abstract
Background: Since the start of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
corticosteroid use has been the subject of debate. The available evidence is uncertain,
and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the
association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized
with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders.
Results: One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a
positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to
corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids.In the
cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients
not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p <0.001). Nonetheless,
exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing
with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids
cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p <0.001).
Conclusions: Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with
COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy
was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure
on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Introduction
In December 2019 a cluster of atypical pneumonia was observed in Wuhan, China. A new
coronavirus, later called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV
2), was identified as responsible for the disease, 1 which subsequently spread to the rest of
the world. More than two thousand patients presented to our Emergency Department with
a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV 2 during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
pandemic, from 20th February to 10th May. One thousand four hundred and forty three of
them were admitted to the hospital.
Many pharmacological therapies have been attempted despite the absence of evidence
supporting their efficacy, among them corticosteroids.
Initially the World Health organization discouraged the use of corticosteroids for the
treatment of COVID-19 because their administration to patients with SARS had shown no
survival benefit and possible harms (avascular necrosis, psychosis, diabetes, and delayed
viral clearance). 2–4 The interest in corticosteroids was renewed by the observation that
their use was associated with a mortality reduction in COVID-19 patients in China,5 and
recommendations after this report included the use of steroids in patients with COVID-19
and ARDS as a weak recommendation.6
This uncertain and evolving evidence concerning the use of corticosteroids had, as a
consequence, their inconstant use in COVID-19 patients. In our hospital they were used in
about 40% of patients.
Gathering evidence on the effect of corticosteroids treatment in COVID-19 is crucial,
because the infection rates of other human coronaviruses have a typical wave pattern with
the pick in autumn\winter7 and a second surge of the disease could be possible.
The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid
therapy and hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for
possible confounders.

Methods
The setting for this observational cohort study was a 600 bed tertiary care hospital located
in Brescia (Northern Italy). Data was extracted from the electronic medical charts of
consecutive patients who had been admitted during the pandemic crisis of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), between February 20th and May 10th
2020. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Brescia (NP-4210).
All research was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical, demographic and laboratory data from all adult patients who were admitted to the
hospital and had a positive test for SARS-CoV2 from biological material were recorded at
admission. Tests were conducted with Real Time Polymerase-Chain-Reaction assay (RTPCR).
Patients younger than 18 years or with no available outcome at the time of analysis were
excluded from the study. Patients were followed up until discharge.
The patients were classified into two cohorts, based on exposure to corticosteroids during
hospitalization.
In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome. The rate of admission to the Intensive Care
Unit was the secondary outcome. Patients were admitted in ICU if they had, during Non
Invasive Ventilation: PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg, dyspnea, tachypnea (more than 40 breaths
per minute), tidal volume greater than 10 ml/kg.
One thousand three hundred seventy seven patients were needed to obtain a power of
85% to detect an Odds Ratio 0.72, assuming mortality was 25% in those receiving
corticosteroids, with a fraction of patients treated of 1:3 and alpha=0.05 8. The 12 weeks
follow up ensured 97% of patients were discharged or had died by the end of the study
period. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (standard deviation) or as median
(1st, 3rd quartile) and factor variables as count (percentage). Bivariate analysis of outcome

was realized on identified a priori variables with Fisher test for factorial variable and t-test
and Mann-Whitney test for continuous ones.
A overlap weight propensity score for treatment allocation was estimated from a
multivariable model containing patient age, sex, PaO2/FiO2, lactate, C Reactive Protein,
Platelets, ICU admission and treatment with corticosteroids, enoxaparin, azithromycin or
hydroxychloroquine. Dose of hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone were converted to
equivalent doses of dexamethasone.9
The overlap weight propensity score was then applied to a logistic regression modelling
the primary outcome (in-hospital mortality)10. Odds Ratio with 95% Confidence Interval
(OR, 95%CI) are reported. The same was performed for OR of ICU admission, considering
only corticosteroids treatment received on the wards. Missing values were assessed and
replaced by mean substitution. If a statistical significant association was found, the Evalues for the point estimate and the confidence interval limit closer to the null were
computed, to assess the possible effect of unmeasured confounder. 11 Three sensitivity
analyses were planned: one taking into account the quartiles of timing of hospital
admission, one excluding patients admitted to intensive care, another analyzing complete
cases. Significance was evaluated at α = 0.05 and all testing was 2-sided.
Statistical analysis was performed using R Studio software version 4.0.0 (R Core Team,
2014) and packages ‘psw’ and ‘E-value’ for overlap weight propensity score and
calculation of E-value. Recorded data from this cohort has been used to evaluate effect of
other pharmacological intervention in COVID 19, manuscripts at present are undergoing
peer-review.

Results
One thousand four hundred and forty three patients were admitted to our hospital with a
positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Five hundred and fifty nine patients (39%) were

exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to
corticosteroids. Twentyseven patients were excluded from the analysis (one patient was
younger than 18 years, and 26 patients were still hospitalized at the time of the analysis).
Median equivalent doses of dexamethasone dose (cumulative dose/days of therapy) was
10 mg (1st-3rd quartile 4.5-20). Patients who were never admitted to ICU received
equivalent doses of dexamethasone of 8 mg (4-16.1). Duration of corticosteroid therapy
was longer in survivors than in patients who died: 6 (4-10) days vs 4 (1-7), respectively (p
<0.001).
Clinical and laboratory characteristics in the cohort of patients exposed and not exposed to
corticosteroids are shown in Table 1. Age was not significantly different between the two
cohorts, while Body Mass Index was higher in patients treated with corticosteroids. Arterial
hypertension was more frequent in the corticosteroid group, while diabetes mellitus was
not significantly different between the two groups. Patients in the corticosteroids cohort
were more hypoxic and the inflammation markers (CRP and LDH) were higher, moreover
lymphocytopenia was more severe. PaCO2 was not different in the two cohorts. One
hundred seventy one patients died (30.6%) in the cohort of patients exposed to
corticosteroids, and 183 (21.7%) died in the cohort of patients not exposed to
corticosteroids (unadjusted p <0.001). Fifty six patients (11.5%) were admitted to ICU in
the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids on the ward vs 131 (14.4%) who were not
treated with corticosteroids in the ward (unadjusted p =0.15).
All the recorded variables were associated with mortality in the bivariate analysis except
for Body Mass Index, history of arterial hypertension or diabetes mellitus and PaCO 2, as
shown in Table 2.
Covariate balancing with overlap weight propensity score is shown in Figure 1 expressed
as standardized mean difference which became zero after balancing.

Table 3 shows that the exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital
mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score. Patients in the
corticosteroids cohort had reduced risk of ICU admission and E-value of 2.26 (1.76 upper
limit of C.I.). Planned sensitivity analyses were in agreement with these findings.

Discussion
Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19
after balancing for confounders. Since their use was first proposed as a treatment strategy
for ARDS,12,13 corticosteroids have been at the center of controversy in the scientific
community.
Some evidence points towards a beneficial effect of corticosteroids in ARDS.12,14–16
Recently Villar et al.17 showed that early therapy with dexamethasone could reduce the
duration of mechanical ventilation and the overall mortality in patients with established
moderate-to-severe ARDS, possibly because early administration could have an effect on
the systemic immune response involved in ARDS pathophysiology. Some evidence casts
doubts on the appropriateness of corticosteroid therapy: a large multicenter randomized
clinical trial18 showed no benefit in ARDS and found an increased risk of mortality when
treatment began late in the course of the disease. Moreover, corticosteroid use has been
associated with complications such as increased infection rate, 19 hyperglycemia,20,21
hypernatremia22 and ICU acquired weakness.23
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, caution was advised when prescribing
corticosteroids, due to the possibility of a more prolonged viral shredding and reduced viral
clearance.24 The off-label use of steroids became increasingly popular after the first study
about a possible decrease of mortality in COVID-19 ARDS with the use of corticosteroids
was published.5 Nevertheless, this study suffered some relevant limitations.
Corticosteroids therapy was assessed in a small cohort of ARDS patients (84 patients),

and 50 out of them (60%) received methylprednisolone. More relevantly, data were shown
without any balancing for possible confounders.
The crude mortality in our study was higher in patients treated with corticosteroids than in
patients who did not receive them. The risk of in-hospital death did not differ between
treated and non treated patients when adjusted for patients’ characteristics, which were
similar to the ones described in previous studies.25–27 The lack of effect of steroids on
crude mortality has been previously reported in COVID-19 patients.28,29 Recently a preprint, not peer-reviewed manuscript of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) called RECOVERY
trial was made available. This trial reports a 3% reduction of hospital mortality with the use
of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. We hope that the peer reviewed results and
conclusions of this study will be made available as soon as possible, so as to have a better
understanding of the effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19.30 Nonetheless data from
randomized clinical trials should always be compared to data from observational studies,
because it might suffer from limited external validity. In many occasions, randomized trials
on septic patients were not subsequently confirmed and their importance was reduced with
time, including what concerned the use of steroids. 31–34
A positive finding associated with the use of steroids was a reduced ICU admission rate
compared to patients not receiving them. Corticosteroids can improve compliance and
hypoxemia in ARDS patients,18 reducing the indication for ICU admission in our hospital
during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was triggered by hypoxemia severity and dyspnea.
In this sense, therapy with corticosteroids could be useful in reducing pressure on the
Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic,
when ICU bed occupancy had to be rationalized.
The impact of steroid therapy cannot be assessed without considering the used dose. In
our patients the median equivalent dose of dexamethasone was 10 mg/die. Recent data
showed that a low dose corticosteroids, defined ad lower than 1 mg∙kg -1∙day-1 of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155994; this version posted July 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

prednisone (equivalent to 0.15 mg∙kg-1∙day-1 of dexamethasone),9 had no effect on
mortality, whereas higher doses were independently associated with and increase risk of
death in patients with severe COVID-19.35 The weight in our patients was 77 (17) kg,
which means that the average daily dose was about 0.13 mg∙kg -1∙day-1. Therefore the
finding that low doses of steroids have no impact on mortality is confirmed by our data.
The study suffers three main limitations. First, it is a retrospective analysis of prospectively
collected data. Second, it is a single center study and the findings might be valid for
centers with a similar setting and volume of COVID-19 admissions. Finally, propensity
score with overlap method was used to balance covariate across the two treatment
cohorts, so the effect of known covariate associated with mortality was taken into account
and more robust conclusions could be drawn.36 Nevertheless the effect of unmeasured
confounders or could not be excluded. In light of this limitation, meta-analyses taking into
account data from this and other observational studies are needed.
In conclusion, treatment with corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality
in patients admitted for COVID-19, when balancing for possible confounders. A possible
advantage of corticosteroids was to reduce ICU admission, which could be useful in
reducing pressure on the Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
