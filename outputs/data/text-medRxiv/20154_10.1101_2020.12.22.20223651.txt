Evidence before this study

25

To map this field, bibliographic searches were conducted in the Web of Science, which included

26

the following results: (i) COVID-19 (95,133 hits), (ii) SARS COV-2 (33,680 hits), (iii) testing

27

policy and COVID-19 (939 hits), (iv) testing policy and SARS COV-2 (340 hits), (v) testing

policy and COVID-19 and asymptomatic (80 hits), (vi) testing policy and SARS COV-2 and

29

asymptomatic (54 hits); (vii) test positivity and COVID-19 and validation (7 hits), and (viii) test

30

positivity and SARS CoV-2 and validation (5 hits). Therefore, before this study, testing policy in

31

relation to asymptomatic cases as well as test positivity represented a very low proportion

32

(between ~1

distinguished between diagnostic and screening tests, no paper was found in which testing policy

34

is mentioned as part of a process ultimately designed to isolate all infected individuals. The few

35

articles that mentioned test positivity only investigated symptomatic cases. These

Added value of this study

40

We provide the first validation of test positivity as an estimate of disease prevalence under

41

rapidly changing conditions: in pandemics, disease prevalence may vary markedly within short

42

periods of time. We also address a double limitation of control campaigns against COVID-19,

43

namely: it is unknown who and where to test. Asymptomatic cases are not likely to seek medical

44

assistance: while they feel well, they silently spread this pandemic. Because they represent

45

approximately half of all infected individuals, they are a large, moving, and invisible target.

46

Where to find them is also unknown because (i) randomized testing is likely to fail and (ii)

47

testing is very limited. Usually, the locations where infected people reside are not randomly

48

distributed but geographically clustered, and, up to now less than four persons per thousand

49

inhabitants are tested on a given day. However, by combining geo-referenced test positivity data

50

with cost-benefit considerations, we generate approaches not only likely to induce high benefits

51

without increasing costs but also free of assumptions: we measure bio-geography as it is.

52
53

Implications of all the available evidence

54

The fact that asymptomatic cases were not tested in many countries may explain the exponential

55

growth and much higher number of deaths observed in those countries. Ineffective testing (and,

56

therefore, ineffective isolation) can also result from the absence of geo-referenced data analysis.

57

Because the geographical location where people reside, work, study, or shop is not a random

58

event, the analysis of small greographical areas is essential. Only when actual geographical

59

relationships are observed, optimal (cost-benefit oriented) testing policies can be devised.

Summary

62

Background To stop pandemics, such as COVID-19, infected individuals should be detected,

63

treated if needed, and –to prevent contacts with susceptible individuals− isolated. Because most

64

infected individuals may be asymptomatic, when testing misses such cases, epidemics may

65

growth exponentially, inducing a high number of deaths. In contrast, a relatively low number of

66

COVID-19 related deaths may occur when both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are tested.

67

Methods To evaluate these hypotheses, a method composed of three elements was evaluated,

68

which included: (i) county- and country-level geo-referenced data, (ii) cost-benefit related

69

considerations, and (iii) temporal data on mortality or test positivity (TP). TP is the percentage of

70

infections found among tested individuals. Temporal TP data were compared to the tests/case

71

ratio (T/C ratio) as well as the number of tests performed/million inhabitants (tests/mi) and

72

COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi).

73

Findings Two temporal TP profiles were distinguished, which, early, displayed low (~ 1 %)

74

and/or decreasing TP percentages or the opposite pattern, respectively. Countries that exhibited

75

>10 TP % expressed at least ten times more COVID-19 related deaths/mi than low TP countries.

76

An intermediate pattern was identified when the T/C ratio was explored. Geo-referenced, TP-

77

based analysis discovered municipalities where selective testing would be more cost-effective

78

than alternatives.

Introduction
Albert Bartlett partially dedicated his life to teaching the expressions and consequences

86

of the exponential function [1]. Epidemics –including the COVID-19 pandemic− tend to grow or

87

decline exponentially. Given the catastrophic consequences of the epidemic exponential growth

88

[2 Rudan ], the first priority in epidemic control is to avoid contacts: when it takes just 60 days to

89

increase from 1 to > 60,000 COVID-19 related deaths (as observed in this pandemic),

90

‘coexistence with the virus’ or ‘flattening the epidemic curve’ is not a likely outcome.

91

Because blocking contacts between infected and susceptible individuals prevents the

92

exponential growth of an epidemic, testing is the first priority of a control policy: it allows to

93

detect, treat if needed, and isolate all infected individuals. Hence, the WHO summarizes its

94

recommendations with three words: test, treat, isolate [3].

95

However, a substantial proportion of individuals infected with SARS CoV-2 may be

96

infectious even without symptoms. Hence, identifying asymptomatic cases is a crucial element in

97

epidemic control: if they were rapidly identified and subsequently isolated, the virus could be

98

removed from the environment and the pandemic would stop [4-7]. The theoretical solution for

99

this problem is to test every inhabitant of every country.

100

Unfortunately, massive testing (the type required to identify all infected individuals) is

101

not currently feasible in most countries. This situation creates a new challenge: how can major

102

disseminators of the COVID-19 pandemic be identified when testing is limited (or very limited)?

103

Therefore, a fourth action should be added to the three proposed by WHO: identification.

104

The determination of the geographical sites where asymptomatic cases are likely to be located is

105

the linchpin of epidemic control. However, only a minor proportion of the population is tested on

106

a given day (usually less than four per thousand inhabitants [8]). Given the scarce resources

107

available, the limited testing, and the need to remove viral spreaders before the epidemic

108

exponential growth overwhelms the anti-epidemic responses, identification should be precise,

109

rapidly implemented, and cost-effective [9-11]. To address this composite problem, new metrics

110

and methods may be required.

111

Test positivity (TP) is a concept to be considered. TP is the percentage of infections

112

detected among tested individuals. While TP has been used for more than seven decades, in the

113

context of COVID-19 it was first mentioned on March 30, 2020, by WHO [12]. Classically, TP

114

has been utilized in reference to the ability of a test to identify and distinguish infection-positive

115

from infection-negative individuals (also known as sensitivity and specificity,when the inference

116

refers to the past; or test positive/negative predictive value, when the inference refers to the

117

future). Such tests have a diagnostic purpose. They differ from screening tests [7, 13].

118

In this report, TP is viewed as a metric that may evaluate the efficacy of testing programs

119

aimed at detecting asymptomatic COVID-19 cases; i.e., test positivity percentages may indirectly

120

help to elucidate whether testing is or is not capturing asymptomatic cases, even when the

121

number of tests performed per million inhabitants is low. In this context, TP is a component of

122

an epidemiologic strategy used in a rapidly changing environment with the purpose of detecting

123

and isolating infected individuals before the epidemic exponential process consolidates.

124

To the best of our knowledge, the validity of the TP metric to detect asymptomatic cases

125

when testing is limited has not yet been demonstrated. To understand why TP percentages may

126

achieve that goal, the history of epidemics is worth revisiting. When disease prevalence is zero

127

(before an epidemic starts), the TP % is zero, too. The TP % is expected to be non-zero (but

128

relatively low) after epidemic onset. That is so because even the worst epidemics on record have

129

infected only a minor percentage of the population –for instance, the highest estimates on

6

130
131

fatalities induced by the 1918 flu pandemic are about 5% [14].
Accordingly, when the TP % approaches or exceeds 50% (as reported in several countries

132

affected by COVID-19), it is unlikely that such numbers reflect the actual disease prevalence.

133

Instead, high TP percentages may express testing conducted within a subpopulation that does not

134

(or only marginally) promote(s) epidemic spread: the group of symptomatic cases. Because

135

symptomatic cases are easily detected, they are also easily treated and isolated. Consequently,

136

symptomatic cases are not likely to disseminate epidemics. In contrast, infected but undetected

137

individuals –asymptomatic cases− transmit the disease [15].

138

Therefore, high TP percentages may be observed when the testing policy predominantly

139

detects symptomatic cases (as explicitly pursued by official policies or promoted by research

140

institutions of some countries [16-18]). This hypothesis is further supported when the alternative

141

is associated with promising outcomes, that is, when lower TP values are found in countries

142

where the testing policy explicitly captures asymptomatic cases and, later, much fewer deaths per

143

million inhabitants are reported than in countries reporting high TP percentages. This means that

144

low TP percentages may reflect the prompt removal of SARS CoV-2-positive individuals –a

145

likely outcome of policies that test asymptomatic cases. Thus, empirically elucidating whether

146

high TP percentages are found when asymptomatic cases are excluded in the testing policy as

147

well as the alternative hypothesis −low TP percentages are associated with testing programs

148

that detect asymptomatic cases− are pre-requisites of scientifically sound testing policies meant

149

to identify and isolate the spreaders of epidemics.

150

Other metrics of potential interest include: (i) the number of new cases, (ii) the number

151

of COVID-19 related deaths/million inhabitants (deaths/mi), and (iii) the ratio between the

152

number of tests and the number of cases detected (the T/C ratio). The time when the highest

153

number of new cases occur is a relevant input of epidemiologic decision-making [19]. Because

154

testing policies that only emphasize symptomatic cases will generate biased estimates on when

155

new cases peak, approaches that detect asymptomatic cases are needed [16].

156

To demonstrate that novel testing methods can capture asymptomatic cases even when

157

testing is limited, high-resolution, geo-referenced data may be required. When small

158

geographical areas report high TP percentages, intensive testing in such areas could induce

159

benefits that will include the larger surrounding area, generating high benefit-cost ratios [20].

160

Accordingly, relationships between the TP percentage, its inverse (the number of tests

161

conducted per each detected case ratio or T/C ratio), and other metrics (the number of new cases

162

and the number of deaths per million inhabitants) were investigated across countries and −using

163

geo-referenced data of high resolution − across municipalities. This study aimed at elucidating

164

whether, when and where the TP percentage and/or the T/C ratio informed earlier and/or

165

provided more information than classic metrics in reference to asymptomatic cases and, if so

166

demonstrated, whether such metrics, once geo-referenced, could foster region-specific, cost-

167

benefit oriented control policies.

176

showed non-overlapping intervals of TP and such classes also revealed non-overlapping intervals

177

of epidemic-related outcomes (deaths/million inhabitants). Differences in median deaths/million

178

inhabitants between low TP and high TP countries were investigated with the Mann-Whitney test

179

using a commercial statistical package (Minitab LLC, State College, PA, USA). Geographical

180

data were processed with ARC GIS software (ESRI, Redlands, Ca, USA). Thirteen countries

181

were evaluated because, together, they exhibited geographical and demographic diversity and

182

individually, they were affected by COVID-19 long enough (two or more months) so they could

183

reveal exponential epidemic growth, if it happened. Such countries were: Bangladesh, Belgium,

184

Colombia, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Germany, Greece, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,

185

Uruguay, and the United States. To explore georeferenced data on test positivity, the

186

municipality-specific data reported by Harvard University on Puerto Rico were analyzed

187

[https://rconnect.dfci.harvard.edu/covidpr/?s=08]. Because many countries have reported errors

188

and/or changed the definition of cases and deaths and because not all affected countries were

189

investigated, inferences should not be construed to be representative. However, inferences

190

derived from patterns observed in two or more countries (or regions of a country) may be viewed

191

as plausible and, possibly, generalizable.

Results

Test positivity-related temporal patterns

201

Findings revealed two temporal patterns: (i) one characterized by an early TP peak (the

202

highest TP percentages took place in the first weeks), followed by a rapid decline to ~ 1% (four

203

countries, green rectangles, Figs. 1 A-D); and (ii) a pattern shared by six countries, which

204

showed later and increasing TP values, even >10%, over one or more weeks (red rectangles,

205

Figs. 1 E-J). In addition, the data of ten countries consistently demonstrated that the highest TP

206

percentages occurred earlier or at the same time as, but not later than the number of new cases

207

(Fig. 1 A-J). The first pattern (low TP percentage) was associated with a quasi-complete

208

cessation of the epidemic within four months. The second pattern (high TP percentages) was

209

shown by countries where, four to six months into the epidemic, the median number of deaths/mi

210

was at least 10 times higher than in countries displaying the alternative pattern (p<0.02, Fig. 2).

211
212

Validation of TP-based testing policies designed to detect asymptomatic cases

213

Four-dimensional (3D and temporal) plots that included TP percentages and T/C ratios

214

identified three profiles, characterized by: (i) high TP percentages (data points shown only in the

215

upper right quadrant, 4 countries); (ii) a hybrid pattern, which exhibited high TP and some high

216

T/C observations (one country); and (iii) countries predominantly displaying high T/C ratio

217

values (four countries, Figs. 3 A-I). TP values less than 5 % did not predict the end of the

218

epidemic –even countries displaying < 1% TP over more than two weeks failed to report zero

219

cases after such a period of time (Figs. 4 A-D).

Exploration of geo-referenced and temporal TP as tools of cost-effective policies

222

To investigate the hypothesis that geo-referenced and temporal TP data support site-

223

specific, cost-effective interventions, the test positivity percentages reported in all municipalities

224

of Puerto Rico on September 11, 2020, were investigated. One municipality reported a TP

225

>50%, which was surrounded by 17 municipalities that reported much lower TPs. Assuming that

226

testing resources (including tests) were distributed according to the size of the population, the

227

municipality with >50% TP received 1/42 of such resources and the remaining municipalities

228

obtained testing-related resources 42 times larger in magnitude (Fig. 5).

229

Such a situation facilitated cost-benefit oriented, geographically and epidemiologically

230

specific interventions. For instance, if the level of testing implemented in area 1 (the

231

municipality with >50% TP) was decided to be increased 1000%, immediately −but no new

232

resources were provided−, the additional tests required in area 1 could only come from area 2.

233

This means that 10 of the original 43 units of resources spent in areas 1 and 2 (1 unit spent in

234

area 1 and 42 units spent in area 2) would now be used in area 1 (a 1000% increase). This

235

solution would cause a 23.56 % reduction (from 42 to 32) in the units of resources spent in area 2

236

− a region barely affected by the epidemic and, therefore, highly vulnerable (Fig. 5).

237

These data also estimated the costs of random testing and/or testing that ignores geo-

238

temporal cost-benefit considerations. If the surrounding area (area 2) was affected as much as

239

area 1, the size of epidemic could increase 42 times (Fig. 5). This epidemic growth could occur

240

even if testing continued, uninterruptedly, at the same level as previously performed.

outcome) or the alternative pattern suggested additional testing was needed (Fig. 6A-D). The use

246

of the number of deaths per million inhabitants was also informative (Figs. 6 E-H).

247
248
249

Discussion
Because asymptomatic patients rarely request medical assistance, they may become the

250

invisible spreaders of epidemics. Consequently, testing, treating, and isolating such cases should

251

be prioritized [3]. However, given that testing is usually limited, their identification is

252

problematic [8]. This compounded problem was addressed with an approach that, considering

253

test positivity (TP), evaluated testing policies that prioritize the detection of asymptomatic cases

254

and also considers geo-referenced, cost-benefit oriented data analysis.

255

Testing symptomatic or asymptomatic cases may depend on medical and public health-

256

related perspectives [7]. For instance, testing that emphasizes symptomatic cases differs from

257

screening-oriented testing. In the first case, it is assumed that epidemics can be stopped through

258

interventions conducted within hospitals –as when individuals that feel ill seek medical

259

assistance. It is expected to find high percentages of test positivity when confirmatory testing is

260

promoted (the type of testing physicians are likely to prescribe). While this type of testing (or

261

purpose) is necessary when a clinical perspective is considered, it does not contribute much to

262

prevent epidemic spread, which depends on early detection of asymptomatic cases [7,18]. In

263

contrast, in population medicine, epidemiologic testing is needed (screening or information

264

usable in epidemic control, not only in clinical medicine). Here it was hypothesized that lower

265

TP percentages predicted lower numbers of deaths per million inhabitants than when higher TP

266

percentages were observed –findings consistent with the hypothesis that asymptomatic cases are

267

detected when the percentage of TP is low. Findings supported these hypotheses, opening a path

268

toward scientifically grounded testing policies that seek to detect (and immediately isolate)

269

asymptomatic –not only symptomatic− cases [7, 18]. As expected, countries that displayed high

270

TP percentages in early epidemic stages, later reported many more deaths/mi than low TP

271

countries. These findings supported the notion that, in high TP countries, asymptomatic cases

272

were missed and, consequently, the epidemic grew exponentially and so did deaths.

273

The epidemics here investigated also showed that TP peaks occur earlier than the peak

274

number of new cases. Data turning points (which include peaks) help to conduct epidemiologic

275

forecasts [21].

276

Findings also addressed the statement made by WHO on May 12, 2020, which suggested

277

that low (<5%) TP values over two consecutive weeks signal that an epidemic is under control

278

[22]. This study found that even 1% TP was associated with longer epidemics (Figs. 3 A-D).

The fact that neither a 5% nor a 1 % TP cutoff predicted the immediate cessation of an

280

epidemic was expected: dichotomization of continuous data promotes errors. Such a procedure

281

assumes that the discrete (discontinuous) nature of a process can change below or above a cutoff

282

generated by continuous data. Yet, the evidence demonstrated that an ‘epidemic-positive’

283

country does not become an ‘epidemic-negative’ one when TP changes from 5.00 to 4.99 %.

284

While pattern recognition can discriminates without numerical cutoffs (as Fig. 5 shows), the

285

dichotomization assumption tends to lose information and generates errors [23].

286

Therefore, TP seems a robust and explanatory metric. Unlike the number of new cases,

287

TP may inform when (and, provided that geo-referenced information is also available, where)

288

spikes of its percentage will identify specific places that require additional testing so

289

asymptomatic cases can be rapidly detected, isolated, and treated [24]. However, to prevent such

290

patients from promoting exponential epidemic growth, early and geographically-specific

291

responses are needed. Here, an operational model showed that observable geo-epidemiologic

292

features can generate site-specific, cost-effective interventions.

293

Investigating geo-referenced epidemiologic data matters because humans are not

294

homogeneously distributed in space. Lakes, railroads, schools and many other (geographically

295

specific) entities both separate and connect humans. While some geographical points act as

296

epidemic nodes, many points do not seem to influence epidemic spread [25].

297

While earlier studies have conducted cost-benefit analysis of COVID-19 control policies,

298

they lacked geo-referenced data [26]. The geo-referenced, cost-benefit theory followed in this

299

study assumed that epidemics disseminate as floods do: from a ‘higher’ point (where disease

300

prevalence or its surrogate, test positivity, is higher) toward surrounding areas where test

301

positivity percentages are lower. When cost-benefit oriented interventions are not immediately

302

implemented in such situations, the epidemiologic condition of the surrounding region can

303

rapidly worsen. This epidemiologic ‘flood’ metaphor was empirically supported: rapid

304

interventions in small areas that threaten larger areas tend to be highly cost-effective and may

305

stop epidemics (Fig. 4).

306

While aggregate (state- or country- level) data do not reveal spatial relationships and,

307

therefore, are not very useful [27], non-aggregate geo-referenced information –e.g., data on

308

neighborhoods− are epidemiologically usable, as shown with municipality-level information

309

collected in Puerto Rico (Fig. 5). When geographical-epidemiological relationships are

310

considered, it is possible to identify policies that benefit not only the area of direct intervention

311

but also the surrounding area –as commonly practiced in flood protection-related policies [28].

312

This approach has also been described as the ‘wrong pocket problem’, i.e., the area where the

313

investment is made does not only benefit from it: a larger area is benefited as well [29]. One

314

example of this geographically grounded, cost-benefit oriented approach has recently been

315

applied in an emergency vaccination against rabies conducted in Tanzania, where a limited

316

intervention in a small ring that surrounded a large city also benefitted the large city [11].

317

Findings support the view that, to stop epidemic exponential growth, testing policies should

318

aim at detecting all infected individuals (including asymptomatic cases). In spite of its relevance,

319

testing policy seems an area that lacks interdisciplinary scientific expertise. Approaches that

320

include temporal and geo-referenced test positivity data, as well as cost-benefit oriented

321

considerations, may contribute toward filling that gap.

countries located in three continents showed new cases even when the percentage of test

450

positivity (TP) was < 1% (ovals, A-D). Because new cases were observed over protracted (more

451

than two-week long) periods of time, it is concluded that no numerical cutoff (e.g., TP < 5%)

452

indicates an epidemic is under control. In contrast, patterns –such as a perpendicular data

that includes ~42 times more people and covers an area ~ 8.5 times larger than those of Jayuya.

Given Jayuya +50% TP, a greater testing effort conducted in this municipality may yield large

460

benefits, which may also include the surrounding area (Area 2) and, indirectly, benefit the

461

western half of the island. Vice versa, keeping the same level of testing performed before may

462

lead to long-lasting, costly consequences: if the virus circulating within Jayuya reached the

463

surrounding area and the prevalence of COVID-19 became similar to the one affecting Jayuya

464

(which is estimated by test positivity), then a much larger number of people (up to 42 times

465

larger) could become infected, who would reside in an area 8.5 times larger, i.e., control would

466

then be much harder, longer and costlier.

benefits, which may also include the surrounding area (Area 2) and, indirectly, benefit the
he
western half of the island. Vice versa, keeping the same level of testing performed before may
ay
lead to long-lasting, costly consequences: if the virus circulating within Jayuya reached the
he
surrounding area and the prevalence of COVID-19 became similar to the one affecting Jayuya
ya
(which is estimated by test positivity), then a much larger number of people (up to 42 times
es
larger) could become infected, who would reside in an area 8.5 times larger, i.e., control would
ld
then be much harder, longer and costlier.

Fig. 6. Relationships between outcomes (non-fatal or fatal infections) and the number of
tests/million inhabitants. Testing policies may be adjusted based on patterns generated by
he
cases (A-D) and fatalities (E-H). When testing grows slower than cases or deaths (when the
curvature approaches a vertical pattern), testing is likely to be insufficient or inadequate.
