Abstract
The world is currently facing an unprecedented pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) which was first reported in late 2019 by China to the World Health
Organization (WHO). The containment strategy for COVID-19, which has non-specific flu-like
symptoms and where upwards of 80% of the affected has either mild or no symptoms, is
critically centered upon diagnostic testing, tracking and isolation. Thus, the development of
specific and sensitive diagnostic tests for COVID-19 is key towards the first successful step of
disease management. Public health organizations like the WHO and the US-based Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed real-time PCR (RT-PCR) based
diagnostic tests to aid in the detection of acute infection. In this study we sought to modify the
CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay protocol to increase its sensitivity and to make the assay directly
portable to health care providers in a community-based hospital setting. A number of
modifications to the original protocol were tested. Increasing the RT-PCR annealing temperature
by 7°C to 62°C was associated with the most significant improvement in sensitivity, wherein the
cycle-threshold (Ct) value for the N2 assay was reduced by ~3 units, in effect both reducing the
overall number of inconclusive results and yielding N1/N2 assays to have similar Ct values. The
limit of detection of the modified assay was also improved (0.86 RNA copies/µl for both nCoV
2019_N1/N2 assays) compared to the CDC RT-PCR diagnostic assay (1 and 3.16 RNA copies/µl
for nCoV 2019_N1 and N2 assay, respectively). Using this modification, there was no significant
effect on SARS-CoV-2 detection rate when viral RNA extraction was performed either manually
or through an automated extraction method. We believe this modified protocol allows for more
sensitive detection of the virus which in turn will be useful for pandemic management.

Introduction
The initial outbreak of a severe respiratory disease in China caused by a novel coronavirus of
unknown origin was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31,
2019 [1, 2]. In this first half year since its reporting, and at the time of this writing, this disease
has spread to 188 countries with more than 12.07 million documented cases and more than
550,000 confirmed deaths worldwide [3]. The US reported its first confirmed case of a personto-person transmission of this novel disease on January 30th, 2020 [2] and since then the US has
been the worst affected country in the world with more than 3 million confirmed cases and
>130,000 deaths [3]. These numbers are most likely vastly underreported than the actual number
of infected and virus-attributable deaths and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.
There are seven known species of coronaviruses that infect humans: 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1,
MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and now the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, named
SARS-CoV-2 [4]. The first four coronavirus strains cause mild symptoms as compared to the
more recent strains like MERS-CoV, the etiologic agent of the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome outbreak of 2012; SARS-CoV-1 responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome epidemic of 2002-2003 and SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the deadly COVID-19
pandemic [4].
The blinding speed with which the COVID-19 has spread across the world, causing thousands of
deaths within a short span of time and impacting millions, has put a lot of pressure on federal
governments and public health organizations in terms of disease management and preparedness

to handle a pandemic of this magnitude. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) developed a laboratory test kit for a real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)-based
diagnostic test, the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019 Novel Coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)–PCR Diagnostic Panel.” [5]. Since then,
many laboratories and organizations have either employed this exact test or developed their own
modified forms to enhance testing capability. Given that diagnostic testing is the central tenet to
understanding and minimizing disease spread, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
relaxed their own existing rules and issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to help cope
with the unprecedented demand for diagnostic testing. At the time of this writing, the FDA has
issued EUAs to 141 in vitro diagnostic tests for COVID-19 including several antibody-based
tests [6].
Evidence suggests that 70-80% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or have very mild
symptoms [7]. All affecteds are contagious and thus capable of spreading the virus. The critical
initial steps in disease management begin with testing, tracking and isolation [8, 9]. Accurate and
specific diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is the pillar upon which this disease management
pipeline is based. During the first peak of the US COVID-19 pandemic, there were shortages of
testing and large commercial laboratories reported multi-day back logs for reporting results,
which rendered patient management ineffective and resulted in multiple inefficiencies of
resources but most importantly, possibly contributed to increased disease spread and death. Due
to these delays in COVID-19 testing, major community health network like Nuvance Health, a
group of seven hospitals in the states of Connecticut and New York, located in the US epicenter
of the COVID-19 outbreak needed to develop their own diagnostic test that can be easily offered

to hundreds of patients that come through the system every day and to the frontline healthcare
workers.
Testing for COVID-19 is not feasible by viral culture as the virus is respiratory in nature, highly
contagious and requires biosafety level 3 facilities that are not available in most health-care
institutions. Serology-based testing although safer to perform, can give a higher false negative as
the test is dependent on the host mounting an immune response post-infection that can take some
time, making this test unsuitable for tracking acute infections. PCR is considered to be the “goldstandard” in molecular diagnostic testing and since its invention in 1983 has been used in the
development of several diagnostic tests for infectious diseases [10]. Availability of the complete
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence early in the pandemic [11] helped to facilitate the development
of the PCR-based diagnostic tests by the WHO [12] and the CDC [5]. We report on our
modification of the CDC-based assay which was refined with the dual aims of developing a
rapid, high sensitivity test that could be quickly ported into clinical use in a community-based,
hospital network.
Material and Methods
Primers and probes
The primers and probes used in this study were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT; Cat No. 10006713), IA (Table 1). These primers and probes were based upon the
sequences provided by the CDC EUA protocol for COVID-19 diagnostic testing [5]. The N1 and
N2 assays were designed based on the Nucleocapsid gene (N) sequence of the SARS-CoV-2
virus (Gene Bank Accession No. NC_045512.2). The human RNase P (Hs_RP) assay was
included as an extraction control.

Control reagents
Positive and negative control reagents used for development of the assay were purchased from
IDT, IA. The positive plasmid control reagents used were: 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (Cat
No. 10006625) and Hs_RPP30 Positive Control (Cat N0. 10006626). The negative control
plasmids were: MERS-CoV Control (Cat No. 10006623) and SARS-CoV Control (Cat No.
10006624). Quantitative Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA: ORF, E, N (ATCC® VR-3276SD™) was
used for all limit of detection (LOD) experiments. All dilutions were prepared using a DNA
suspension buffer (Teknova, CA).
Cell culture
The adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cell line A549 was purchased from ATCC,
Manassas, VA and cultured in 1640-RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 2mM L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo-Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) for complete media. Cells were grown in an air-humidified incubator
at 37°C with 5% CO2. Culture media was replaced every two days and cells were passaged at
80% confluence.

For various experiments, the confluent monolayer was trypsinized using

0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), collected and then centrifuged
at 500g for 7 minutes. The cell pellet was washed twice with sterile 1X phosphate-buffered
saline (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for downstream applications. A549 cells were
either pelleted for total RNA extraction or stored in viral transport medium (VTM) for preparing
samples for LOD experiments. To define cell concentrations, cells were first mixed (1:1) with
Trypan blue reagent (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and then these suspended cells

subjected to automated number and viability assessment using the Countess Automated Cell
Counter (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
Total human RNA extraction
Total human RNA was purified from 1 million A549 cells using RNeasy Purification Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The yield and
quality of the RNA was assessed using Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA).
Viral Transport Media preparation
VTM was prepared in accordance to the CDC recommended protocol [13].
Sample preparation and viral RNA extraction for LOD determination
LOD studies of SARS-CoV-2 were performed using a quantitative synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(ATCC, Cat No. VR-3276SD) that was spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human
A549 cells (500 cells) and 140µl of VTM, to mimic a positive clinical specimen. The synthetic
RNA stock was 3-fold serially diluted with DNA suspension buffer containing 2ng/µl of carrier
RNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), to form a dilution series such that when 5µl of each dilution
was spiked, a range of 15,000 copies (equivalent of 103.4 copies/µl, as per the CDC EUA) to 50
copies (equivalent to 0.34 copies/µl according to the CDC) could be approximated [5]. All
dilutions were performed on ice and in a sterile cabinet. Samples were extracted using the
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), either using the automated QIAcube
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or manually, according to the vendor’s instructions. The lysis step
prior to RNA extraction for all samples was performed manually by the addition of 560µl of

Buffer AVL into each micro-centrifuge tube, followed by the addition of 140µl of the clinical
matrix (A549 cells in VTM) and lastly, 5µl of the appropriate synthetic RNA spike amount. All
samples were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The remainder of the steps in the
RNA extraction protocol was either performed manually or automated using the QIAcube. All
extracted samples were eluted in a final volume of 100µl and immediately processed for
downstream PCR.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) protocol
PCR was performed using a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real Time PCR System (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. QPCR was performed in a total final
reaction volume of 20µl with 5µl of template DNA or RNA, 500nM of primer/probe mix and 1X
TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix, CG (Life-Technologies, Carlsbad, California). Nucleasefree water was added to complete the remaining volume. The CDC recommended PCR
parameters were first used: 25°C - 2 min; 50°C - 15 min; 95°C - 2min; 45 cycles of: 95°C - 3
sec, 62°C - 30 sec [5]. The annealing temperature and primer/probe concentration were varied to
optimize the PCR reaction, as described in the Results section. A cycle threshold (Ct) value of
less than 40 (as per CDC recommendations) was considered to be positive for detection [5]. All
PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and repeated three times.
Results
Analytical sensitivity and specificity testing of SARS-CoV-2 and human-specific gene
assays with DNA controls
As a first step towards assay development, we began by testing the analytical sensitivity of each
TaqMan assay for the SARS-CoV-2 viral N gene (N1 and N2) and the human RNase P gene

(Hs_RP). This was determined using serial two-fold serial dilutions of the positive plasmid
control DNAs (Table 2). CDC recommended PCR parameters were used with the following
DNA concentrations: 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.562 copies. The assay had analytical
LOD of 6.25 DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 for the N1 assay and 50 DNA copies for the N2 assay
(Table 2). When lower copy numbers of DNA were tested, qPCR detection failed due to low
statistical probability of incorporation of these low copy number DNA targets into the PCR
reaction. According to the CDC interpretation guide for patient samples, Ct values of greater
than 40 are considered as negative [5]. For the human RNase P gene, the assay had a sensitivity
of 3.125 DNA copies (Table 2).
Analytical specificity testing of the TaqMan assays for the SARS-CoV-2 viral N gene (N1 and
N2) and the human RNase P gene (Hs_RP) was performed by qPCR with negative plasmid
control DNAs (100 genome copies of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) and with 1ng of total DNA
from 27 clinically relevant microbial species likely to be encountered in a human patient sample,
as listed in Supplemental Table 1. Total genomic DNA from these pathogens was extracted by
QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen Hilden, Germany), according to the vendor’s instructions and
quantitated by Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
DNA from 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (IDT#10006625) and Hs_RPP30 Positive Control
(IDT#10006626) served as positive controls in the assay. None of the TaqMan assays
demonstrated cross-reactivity with any of the control pathogenic agents tested (data not shown).
Optimization of PCR conditions
To ensure robustness of the PCR assay, a number of modifiable parameters were selected for
testing using positive plasmid DNA controls (either 50 or 100 copies per PCR reaction). These
parameters most notably included the concentration of the primer/probe mixes and qPCR

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150771; this version posted July 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

annealing temperatures. A positive effect was considered achieved if Ct values were decreased.
Alteration of the primer/probe concentration from the CDC recommended concentration of
500nM of primer and 125nM of probe, while holding the other qPCR assay parameters as
recommended by the CDC protocol [5], did not have any significant effect on the Ct values for
any of the nCoV 2019_N1, nCoV 2019_N2 and Hs_RP assays (Supplemental Table 2). We then
interrogated the effect of changing annealing temperatures. Including the recommended
annealing temperature of 55°C, and based on our calculations of melting temperatures through
sequence analysis of the primers being used, we tested across a broad range of temperatures:
53°C, 55°C, 57°C, 60°C and 62°C. A significant difference in Ct values, especially for the N2
assay (Table 3) was identified. The Ct values were the lowest at our maximum temperature of
62°C for the N2 assay and gradually increased with lower annealing temperatures (Table 3). The
Ct values for the N2 assay at 62°C annealing temperature was lower by ~3 units, as compared to
the CDC recommended annealing temperature of 55°C. However, for the N1 and the human
RNase P assays there were no significant difference in the Ct values across the entire range of
the annealing temperatures (Table 3). We therefore chose 62°C as our assay annealing
temperature.
Linearity range and LOD determination
To determine the linear dynamic range of the qPCR assay, 10-fold serial dilutions of positive
control DNAs were used to create six concentration levels (range: 106 - 10 copies/reaction) and
then tested with both lab-optimized and CDC-recommended PCR parameters. The lab-optimized
PCR parameters yielded a linear dynamic range across the entire tested dilution spectrum and
reliably detected even 10 copies of both the N1 and N2 targets (Figure 1). In contrast, although
the CDC recommended temperature conditions yielded a linear range across the spectrum, the Ct

values for the N2 assay was more than 40 for 100 copies and other lower concentrations
(Supplemental Figure 1).
The LOD was determined twice for the COVID-19 diagnostic assay: with and without the viral
RNA extraction step. LOD is the lowest concentration that is detected ≥95% of the times they
are tested. For LOD determination without the RNA extraction step, quantitative synthetic
SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ATCC#VR-3276SD) was serially diluted two-fold in DNA suspension
buffer (with 2ng/µl carrier RNA) and then spiked into 2.5µg of total RNA (per PCR reaction)
from human A549 cells, to mimic a clinical sample. The concentration range used for LOD
determination was: 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 and 1.562 copies of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic
RNA. PCR was performed comparing CDC and lab optimized temperature parameters. As
shown in Table 4, theoretically the LOD was 1.562 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA
for both N1 and N2 assays under the lab optimized conditions. Given the low Ct values for the
1.562 RNA copies for the N1 assay-37.18 and the N2 assay-37.13 (Table 4) we can in all
likelihood detect even lower copy numbers before hitting the threshold Ct value of 40, as per
CDC guidelines [5]. By comparison, under the CDC recommended conditions, the N2 assay had
a LOD of 3.125 copies of synthetic RNA (Table 4). Two different operators repeated the
experiment to determine operator-to-operator variability which was found to be <5% for the N1
assay and <2% for the N2 assay (data not shown).
To evaluate possible effects of viral RNA extraction on the LOD and sensitivity of the assay, we
used both manual and automated RNA extractions. In lieu of patient-derived samples, we used a
complex matrix of human A549 cell lysate in VTM (Methods section) combined with SARSCoV-2 synthetic RNA. This matrix was spiked-in with a range of concentrations (103.40, 34.48,
10.34, 3.44, 1.72, 0.86 and 0.34 RNA copies/µl) of the quantitative synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA

to determine LOD. We did not observe any significant differences in Ct values between manual
and automated extractions (Supplemental Table 3). The automated extraction method seemed to
be more sensitive for the N1 assay than the manual one, as 0.34 RNA copies/µl failed to be
detected when manually extracted. There was no evidence of carry-over between samples during
automated extraction, as evident from the negative extraction controls which were VTM alone
interspersed between samples during each cycle of QIAcube RNA extractions (data not shown).
Using the lab optimized parameters, we determined the LOD of the COVID-19 diagnostic assay
by using a range of quantitative synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA serial dilutions spiked into the
artificial clinical matrix as described in the Methods section. PCR was done on three biological
replicates. As evident from Table 5A, the LOD was found to be 0.86 RNA copies/µl for both the
N1 and N2 assays. The intra-assay variance was very low for all the genes: % variance for N1
assay was <1% and for N2 assay was <0.32% (data not shown). The LOD range was then limited
to 1.72/0.86/0.34 RNA copies/µl and retested six more times (Table 5B). The inter-assay
variability was well within the statistically acceptable range for all the assays: for the N1 assay
the variance was <1 % and for the N2 assay variance was <0.30% (data not shown). Finally, the
pre-determined LOD of 0.86 RNA copies/µl for this assay was confirmed using 20 biological
replicates, as per CDC guidelines (20 separate extractions were done on the QIAcube) [5]. We
could detect N1 and N2 assays in all the biological replicates (Table 5C).
Discussion
In this study we have modified the CDC real-time PCR based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 to
make it more sensitive with the aim to reduce the number of inconclusive results. Modification
of PCR parameters decreased the LOD of the assay, which is beneficial for detecting low viral

load patient samples. The availability of the complete sequence of the ~30 kb single-stranded
RNA genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus encoding ~9860 amino acids early in the pandemic
enabled public health organizations and investigating groups to develop highly specific PCRbased diagnostic tests [14, 15]. Investigators have developed tests utilizing varied techniques
including multiplexed real-time PCR [16], real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification
[17], and CRISPR-Cas12-based detection [18]. The initial study on the first twelve patients
diagnosed with COVID-19 in the US revealed that all patients had detectable levels of SARSCoV-2 RNA for 2-3 weeks after the onset of illness and that the highest viral load in the upper
respiratory tract was present within the first week of illness [19]. This data points toward the
necessity for developing very sensitive and specific PCR based diagnostic tests to detect
COVID-19 in the acute stages to help in disease management [9, 20].
A number of reports have identified factors that adversely affect PCR results like varying
methods of collection of specimens, storage methods, transport medium, shipping time and
thermal inactivation to inactivate the virus [21, 22, 23, 24]. A case report of a COVID-19 patient
in Wuhan, China, who had four sequential negative real-time PCR test results of his pharyngeal
swab before eventually testing positive in the fifth round, points toward the possibility of several
factors affecting PCR results negatively [25]. It is quite possible that cases of the recurrence of
the disease and initially negative patients turning positive later on, is due to false negative PCR
results. False negative results or limitations of PCR-based diagnostic tests can lead to positive
COVID-19 patients being diagnosed otherwise, discharged or allowed to leave quarantine and
move freely in the society, aiding in transmission of the disease. Even the most widely used
point-of-care test in the US, the Abbott ID Now (based on real-time PCR), has been reported to

only have an accuracy of ~85% which led to FDA-issued alerts regarding false negatives [26].
Thus, it is a necessity to derive rapid tests that are not only specific, but also highly sensitive.
In this study we modified the CDC real-time PCR diagnostic assay for COVID-19 in an effort to
improve the performance with regard to sensitivity for viral detection and to allow our direct
implementation of this tool in a community-based hospital setting. In addition to the list of
pathogenic agents that the CDC tested for specificity, we extended the specificity testing to
include an additional 27 clinically relevant human pathogenic microbial agents (Supplemental
Table 1) and identified no cross-reactivity with any. Modification of the PCR annealing
temperature facilitated the development of a more robust assay by lowering the Ct values of the
N2 assay in particular (Table 3). An increase in the annealing temperature to 62°C from the CDC
recommended 55°C, allowed the N1 and N2 assays to yield similar Ct values that were much
lower than the cut-off value of 40 that the CDC recommends as being read as a positive result
[5]. The LOD of the modified PCR assay we developed (with the inclusion of the extraction
step) is 0.86 RNA copies per µl (Table 5), which is more sensitive than the CDC assay.
According to the CDC EUA protocol, the LODs of the N1 and N2 assays (with the Qiagen EZ1
DSP extraction kit) are 1 and 3.16 RNA copies/µl, respectively [5]. Without the viral RNA
extraction step, the LOD was found to be 1.562 copies of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA for
both N1 and N2 assays under the lab optimized conditions (Table 4). However, under the CDC
recommended PCR conditions, the N2 assay had a LOD of 3.125 copies of synthetic RNA
(Table 4).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in several types of biological specimens including
sputum, saliva, feces and semen [27, 28]. A recent study has reported sputum to be the most
accurate sample type for COVID-19 diagnosis, followed by nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar

lavage fluid [29]. To our advantage, PCR based tests can be adapted to suit any type of starting
material as long as good quality viral RNA can be extracted. The CDC recommends that a PCR
Ct value of <40 is to be considered as positive when interpreting diagnostic results and if either
the N1 or the N2 assay is positive, the result should be interpreted as inconclusive [5]. By
modifying the assay to get lower Ct values of the N1 and N2 assays even for low viral load
samples, we have tried to reduce the number of inconclusive results. This modification will have
a tremendous impact when applied in a clinical setting to manage a pandemic of this magnitude.
