Abstract

31

The coronavirus disease initiated in 2019 (COVID-19) has proven to be highly contagious and quickly

32

became a pandemic. Nowadays, it presents higher transmission rates worldwide, chiefly in small

33

Brazilian cities, as Ijuí. Located in the northwestern of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) with 83,475

34

inhabitants, Ijuí was selected to receive a population-based survey organized in five steps, involving

35

2,222 subjects. Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

36

and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routine (DPR),

37

comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the

38

official COVID-19 cases in Ijuí, and the mobile social distancing index (MSDI) was also registered. In

39

this study, we demonstrate the decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of

40

COVID-19 community transmission in Ijuí. Also, we provide predictions for cases, hospitalization, and

41

deaths in the city. We concluded that the insufficient social distancing, evidenced by different methods,

42

might have a strong relationship with the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijuí. Our study predicts a

43

closer outbreak of community infection of COVID-19, which could be avoided or attenuated if the levels

44

of the social distancing in the population increase.

Introduction

47

At the end of 2019, some cases of pneumonia of “unknown cause” were noticed by the Wuhan

48

Municipal Health Commission (China) [1]. Collected bronchoalveolar-lavage samples were consistent

49

with an RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family [2]. Thereafter, The World Health Organization named

50

the novel infectious pneumonia as “coronavirus disease 2019” or COVID-19 [3]. COVID-19 had proven

51

to be highly contagious by the time it reached approximately 300 cases in China in January 2020 [4].

52

Thus, it became an epidemic case, with more than 44,000 infections and more than 1,000 deaths in China,

53

with 441 cases outside China in 24 countries [5].

54

The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was reported on February 27 th in the city of São Paulo.

55

Based on published events, eight of the twenty-seven National Federation Units present cumulative

56

mortality rates above 10 per 100,000 inhabitants: four in the North, two in the Northeast, and two in the

57

Southeast Region (Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) [6]. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), the

58

southernmost State in Brazil (with 11.3 million people), the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed on

59

February 29th 2020. As of August 6th, 76,563 confirmed cases (673 per 100,000 inhabitants), and 2,163

60

deaths (19 per 100,000 inhabitants, 2.8% of confirmed cases) had been reported [7,8].

61

Therefore, in the RS, a population-based survey in nine sentinel cities (EPICOVID-RS) was

62

conducted in a period from April to June [8] and included the city of Ijuí, which is localized in the

63

Northwestern region of the state, with a population of 83,475 inhabitants. In this survey, we tested 2,500

64

subjects for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 divided into five rounds (5 with ~500

65

subjects each), indicating that the seroprevalence was undetectable (0 positive cases) on April 12th (round

66

1), and increased to 0,042%[7,8]. Questions regarding social distancing adherence (SDA) and daily

67

preventive routine (DPR) were answered by the subjects who participated in the survey [8]. In parallel,

68

the local government registers and turns public the official COVID-19 cases in Ijuí (for details, see the

69

official government website [9]), while the mobile social distancing index (MSDI) in Ijuí was monitored

70

by means of data collected from mobile geolocation [10].

71

Since there are still no pharmaceutical treatments available, interventions have focused on

72

quarantine and social distancing. The aim of these strategies is to slow down the spread of infection and

73

reduce the intensity of the transmission (a.k.a “flatten the curve”)[11]. The Wuhan outbreak indicates that

74

critical care capacities can be exceeded many times if distancing measures are not implemented quickly

75

or strongly enough [12]. An effective social distancing strategy and monitoring may reduce the risk of an

76

overwhelming the health system, allowing adequate patient care and decreasing mortality rates

77

Thus, considering the local COVID-19 data and the social distancing behavior registered, we showed that

78

low levels of social distancing were not enough to avoid the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ijuí.

Subjects, ethics and study design

[12].

81

Ijuí (latitude 28°23'16 to the south and a longitude 53°54'53" west) is the most populous city in

82

the Northwest region of the state. It is considered a city of students (“University city” with 83,475

83

residents ) and a center of hospital and University resources, as well as the largest and most important

84

population center in the region, with a population rounding 150,000 people.

85

In this study, we follow an interdisciplinary approach to investigate whether the behavior of

86

citizens is associated with the increase in the number of COVID-19 outbreak in Ijuí. First, we considered

87

official data about COVID-19 cases, which is daily updated by the public administration on the

88

government website and plotted as a cumulative case line graph by the date of the initial symptoms and

89

the date of the confirmed test [9]. Second, we analyzed the MSDI for a period that comprehends February

90

1st to July 5th 2020 [10]. Third, we analyzed data from the study EPICOVID-RS in Ijuí regarding SDA

91

and DPR [8]. Finally, we make predictions (starting at 100th case) for COVID-19 in Ijuí regarding the

92

number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, considering different scenarios of transmission rates and

93

compare to update COVID-19 data.

94

The state of RS is divided by the National Institute of Geography and Statistics [13] in eight

95

intermediary regions, so the main city in each region was selected for the study EPICOVID-RS [8]. Ijuí is

96

one of the main cities, so it was selected for this study. Ethical approval was obtained from the Brazilian

97

National Ethics Committee (process number 30415520.2.0000.5313), with written informed consent from

98

all participants.

99

Official COVID-19 data in Ijuí

100

The COVID-19 Municipal Scientific Committee of Ijuí developed an information panel, with public data

101

from the Municipal Epidemiological Surveillance. With this statistical data, the population receives all the

102

information regarding the number of cases confirmed, hospitalizations, recovered, and deaths [9]. The

103

number of cases confirmed is also discriminated by age and gender. Confirmed cases consist of data

104

received from the laboratory analysis, including RT-PCR, Rapid Tests, and Chemiluminescence tests.

105

The numbers of confirmed cases published in the bulletins of the municipal health department may differ

106

from those reported by the state information system (e-SUS VE), because of the frequency of updating

107

the system. Furthermore, the number of confirmed cases shown by the reports of Ijuí Hospitals may differ

108

from municipal data because of the origin of hospitalized patients, which are form different neighboring

109

cities. Our study takes into consideration only data for people residing in Ijuí and from the Ijuí Municipal

110

Health Department.

111

Mobile Social Distancing Index (MSDI)

112

The MSDI was created by the Brazilian private company Inloco (www.inloco.com.br), which has

113

developed a technology to register fingerprints based on geolocalization, which creates a unique identity

114

to users of mobile devices [10]. The company currently monitors a stable set of 60 million mobile devices

115

spread all over the cities of the country. Every device stores and sends anonymous location data regarding

116

its movement during the day every time it connects to the Internet. The MSDI is computed on a daily

117

basis and comprehends the percentage of mobile devices that in a given municipality remain within a

118

radius of 450 meters from the point identified as home, with a precision of the system being less than

119

three meters [10]. Within the period considered in this study (from February 1st to July 5th 2020), the

120

dataset has a total of approximately 1 million records for every city in Brazil. We extracted from this

121

dataset the MSDI the city of Ijuí grouped in a daily measurement.

122

Population-based survey protocol: EPICOVID-RS in Ijuí

123

Multistage sampling was used to select census tracts with probability proportionate to size in the

124

city, and ten households at random in each tract based on census listings updated in 2019. All household

125

members were listed at the beginning of the visit, and one individual was randomly selected through an

126

app used for data collection. The survey rounds took place in the following periods: April 11-13th and 25-

127

27th, May 9-11th and 23-25th, and June 27-29th (for data presentation in figures we considered the mean

128

value for the three days interval). If there were any refusals at the household level, volunteers were

129

instructed to select the next household on the list until they have visited ten families. In the 2nd wave, field

130

workers went to the house visited in the first wave, and then selected the tenth household to its right. The

131

same procedure was performed in the last three waves. In case of refusal, the next house to the right side

132

was selected. In the case of acceptance at the household level, but the selected individual refused to

133

provide a sample, a second member was selected. If this person also refused, the field workers moved on

134

to the next household on the list. (for more details, see reference [8]). Prevalence of antibodies was

135

assessed with a rapid test using finger-prick blood samples - the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test

136

(Wondfo Biotech Co., Guangzhou, China). The sensitivity and specificity of this rapid test were

137

previously validated [8,14].

138

Participants answered short questionnaires, including sociodemographic information (sex, age,

139

diseases, schooling, and skin color), COVID-19-related symptoms, use of health services, compliance

140

with social distancing measures, and use of face masks. Field workers used tablets or smartphones to

141

make a full audio record of each interview, as well as, to register all answers and photograph the test

142

results. All positive or inconclusive tests were read by a second observer, as well as 20% of the negative

143

tests. If the selected subject in a household had a positive result, all other family members were invited to

144

be tested. In this study, we described the characteristics of the sample regarding sex, age, education,

145

ethnicity, and comorbidities (mean and upper and lower limit of confidence interval). The focus of our

146

analyses was on declared social distancing behavior and daily behavior characteristics, as well as the

147

association between comorbidities and social distancing behavior using logistic regression and describing

148

as odds ratio and upper and lower limit of the confidence interval. Interviewers were tested and found to

149

be negative for the virus and so provided with personal protection equipment that was discarded after

150

visiting each home. Positive cases were reported to the municipal and statewide COVID-19 surveillance

151

system. The number of COVID-19 positive subjects was noticed in social media by the RS government

152

always three days after each wave.

153

Prediction of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths

154

Estimative of new cases were first performed using real data about COVID-19 from March 22 th

155

to May 17 th (nine points). Predictions were calculated using equations generated as follows: exponential,

156

defined as proportional rate growth using the expression y = Y0 – (V0/K).(1 - e-kx). Alternatively, linear,

157

defined as a straight line using the expression y = mx + c. After curve fitting, correlations were predicted

158

(extrapolated) by using the online version of MyCurveFit software (https://mycurvefit.com/), and the

159

results were plotted using GraphPad 8.0.

160

To estimate the number of exposed subjects, COVID-19 cases, hospitalization rates, and deaths

→ Exposed → Infected

161

after the 100th case of COVID-19 in Ijuí, we used the method SEIR (Susceptible

162

→ Recovered) model [15]. The full description of the equation was provided in the manuscript of WU

163

and Colleagues [16]. We used the following parameters for the predictions: population 83,200; an initial

164

number of cases as 100; R0 = 2.79 as the basic reproductive number that represents the number of

165

secondary infections that each subject produce, based on the transmission rate documented by the time of

166

the study as a median of 12 studies [17,18]. Also, we used the reproduction number estimated for RS (R0

167

= 1.44) on May 8 th [19].; incubation of virus time as 5.21 days; time that patient remains transmitting

168

virus infection as 2.3 days; the time between incubation and death of 30 days; hospitalization days until

169

recovery as 21 days (severe) and 14 days (mild); hospitalization rate as 12% and mortality at 2.3%, based

170

on RS governmental data until the end of June [7]; time of hospitalization as 14 days. We used these

171

parameters to calculate the number exposed subjects, COVID-19 cases, hospitalization rates and deaths

172

after the 100 th case of COVID-19 in Ijuí in six different situations: 1) maintaining the transmission rate of

173

community infection by COVID-19 as R0 = 2.79; 2) reducing by 50% the transmission rate (Rt = 1.44) of

174

COVID-19 exactly 30 days after the 100th case; and, 3) reducing by 50% the transmission rate (Rt = 1.44)

175

of COVID-19 exactly 15 days after the 100th case. 4) maintaining the transmission rate of community

176

infection by COVID-19 as R0 = 1.44; 5) reducing by 50% the transmission rate (Rt = 0.79) of COVID-19

177

exactly 30 days after the 100th case; and, 6) reducing by 50% the transmission rate (Rt = 0.79) of COVID-

178

19 exactly 15 days after the 100th case. These estimations were calculated using a free website of the

179

University of Sao Paulo for epidemic profile calculation [20].

180

Results

181

The daily MSDI computed using data from mobile monitoring for the city of Ijuí is showed in Figure 1A.

182

The period of monitoring revealed that on the first day of mobile monitoring, the MSDI was 30.7%

183

(Saturday) and reached 39.3% on Sunday (February 2nd) and decreased to 27.5% in the first working day

184

registered (February 3rd). These data describe the normal social behavior in Ijuí, which remained with few

185

fluctuations in average until mid-March, when it scales up to 70.2% on Sunday, (March 22th) and

186

sustained between 50% and 55% on subsequently working days. However, at the end of June, the MSDI

187

decreased to 31.4% (on June 19th), reaching the lowest value since the first case in the city (registered as

188

March 18th, see Figure 1B). The last register in working data showed 35.3% of MSDI. For a fair

189

comparison, percentages pointed above the open circles on Figure 1A correspond to MSDI on weekends,

190

whereas the closed circles correspond to MSDI on working days. Thus, it is possible to observe that there

191

is naturally an increase in distancing due to the fact that more people tend to stay in their homes on

192

weekends. However, the decrease in MSDI may be observed, including on weekends since was registered

193

a 70.2% on March 22nd, while this level decreased to 48.2% on June 21st. From a macro point of view, it

194

is evident that the population of Ijuí is leaving distancing and increasing its social interaction up to the

195

end of June.

196

The first COVID-19 case in Ijuí (Figure 1B) started to feel symptomatic on March 18th (diagnosed after

197

that). It is possible to observe that until May 17th, there was a slight increase in the number of cases

198

registered in Ijuí (Figure 1B). However, on June 7th, there was a 2.1-fold increase in total COVID-19

199

cases. The profile of the confirmed cases revealed that 52.4% of the COVID-19 cases in Ijuí occurred in

200

women and 47.7% in men, and the majority of cases (86%) are younger than 60 years old (Figure 1C).

201

Until the end of June, Ijuí presented a 9,5% hospitalization of positive COVID-19 cases, which 74.1% are

202

older than 50 years, and there was no hospitalization in subjects younger than 30 years old. The majority

203

(70.4%, n = 19) of the hospitalized cases are men in comparison with women (29.6%, n = 8). Also, until

204

the end of June, there was just one death caused by COVID-19 in Ijuí (men, 85 years-old, oncologic

205

patient with diabetes and hypertension). The urban distribution of COVID-19 cases in Ijuí indicates that

206

approximately 30% are downtown inhabitants (Supplementary material, Figure S1).

207

[insert figure 1 here]

208

In each round of the population-based survey, more than 400 adults were inquired and tested to the

209

presence of Sars-Cov-2 antibodies, totalizing 2,222 subjects included in the study. Characteristics of the

210

subjects are described in Supplementary material Table 1 and Table 2 as supplementary material. The

211

social distancing population-based survey started on April 12 th, and revealed that the majority of the

212

subjects declared high SDA to the recommendations (Figure 2A). However, it is possible to observe a

213

decrease in the proportion of subjects that declared adherent to social distancing (high adherence) in

214

parallel to the increase of the proportion that partially adheres to social distancing (Figure 2A). Similarly,

215

the proportion of the subjects that stayed at home during all the time or declared go out only for essential

216

needs has decreased, while there was an increase in the number of people that declared went out their

217

home daily for work (Figure 2B). Thus, it is possible to observe that there was a decrease in the MSDI

218

just 15 days after the first round, which remains to decrease until the end of May (blue lines in Figure

219

2C). In contrast, there was a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Ijuí in the period of

220

May to June (red line, Figure 2C), which may evocate a recovered of SDA and DPR approximately one

221

month later (June) (blue lines in Figure 2C).

222

[insert figure 2 here]

223

We have also analyzed two scenarios to estimate the number of cases in Ijuí after May 17th

224

(Figure 3A): First, a sustained controlled community infection represented by a linear trend (green line in

225

Figure 3A, estimated by the equation y = 1.416667x - 1.416667, R² = 0.848, P = 0.0004); second, an

226

uncontrolled outbreak community infection in Ijuí, represented by an exponential progression in the

227

number of cases (blue line in Figure 3B, y = 1.351649 - (-0.2424262/-0.3155474).(1 -

228

0.955, P = 0.00019). Worryingly, the number of real cases registered (red line in Figure 3A) was higher

229

than estimated by linear and exponential prediction, since 277 COVID-19 cases registered in Ijuí until

230

July 7th, while the estimative predicted 23 and 120 COVID-19 cases by linear and exponential equations,

231

respectively. Thus, since the exponential estimative (blue line) showed that Ijuí could reach 1,000 cases

e^(+0.3155474x)

, R2 =

232

on August 23 rd, the anticipation of this scenario, marked by the real registered COVID-19 cases, indicates

233

a risk to overwhelm the public health system in Ijuí.

234

Considering the real scenario in the context of the 100th case of COVID-19 in Ijuí, we analyzed

235

the predictions for the following months after that. It is possible to estimate a great effect on the number

236

of subjects exposed to coronavirus in the next two months, with higher levels of infected subjects,

237

hospitalization, and deaths, if the transmission rate is maintained, while would have a great benefit if

238

decreases the transmission rate as soon as possible, mainly if reach controllable levels. In this worst

239

scenario (R0 = 2.79), the overwhelm of public and private health care systems is evident since it would

240

more than 4,000 hospitalizations cases simultaneously and more than 1,500 deaths in the following 120

241

days (Figure 3B). In contrast, if the transmission rate of COVID-19 is reduced by 50%, precisely 30 days

242

after the 100th case (Rt = 1.40), it is expected a moderate decrease in the impact on the healthcare system

243

(Figure 3C). For further protection, we analyzed the impact on the transmission rate of COVID-19 if the

244

population reduces by 50% (Rt = 1.40), precisely 15 days after the 100th case (Figure 3D). Thus, the

245

exposed subjects would decrease, reducing the peak of infected subjects to 1,314, expected to occur in 66

246

days. Consequently, the peak of hospitalization would be later, close to three months after the 100th case

247

(85th day), with 1,582 subjects, resulting in 862 deaths in 120 days. If we consider the RS transmission

248

rate document (R0 = 1.44) without any alteration after the 100th case would be found a higher number of

249

infections, hospitalizations, and deaths peaking after two months (Figure 3E). However, if the

250

transmission rate of COVID-19 is reduced by 50%, precisely 30 days after the 100th case (Rt = 0.79), it is

251

expected a considerable decrease in the impact on the healthcare system, with 156 daily cases in the peak

252

(34th day) and 120 hospitalizations by day two months after the 100th case, and 62 deaths in 120 days

253

(Figure 3F). Finally, a significant decrease would be expected if the transmission rate of COVID-19

254

reduces by 50% (Rt = 0.79) precisely 15 days after the 100th case (Figure 3G): the infection peak would

255

reach 75 simultaneous cases and 52 hospitalizations, resulting in 27 deaths. The proportion of the whole

256

population that needs recovered decreased from approximately 82.0% in the worst prediction to 1.37% in

257

the best one. In detail, in the last prediction, considering a reduction of 50% in the transmission rates, if

258

applied 15 days after the 100th case, approximately 98.7% of the population of Ijuí would remain without

259

infection, and approximately 1.37% would be recovered (1,162 subjects).

Discussion

262

Our study described the SDA, DPR, MSDI, predictions, and the progression of COVID-19 cases

263

in Ijuí (Brazil). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that described the social distancing

264

behavior of the community based on a population-survey procedure together mobile monitoring data, that

265

preceded the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, it is the first report regarding estimative of the progression of the

266

disease in the city.

267

During February, the city of Ijuí, as well as its neighboring cities, have not registered any case of

268

COVID-19 in their population. The first case registered in the estate of RS, to which Ijuí belongs, was in

269

the city of Campo Bom, 402 km away from Ijuí, and very close to the capital of the estate (Porto Alegre),

270

on March 10th. The first case of COVID-19 registered in Ijuí dates back to March 18th, when the patient

271

started to feel symptomatic. Note that, only after eight days Ijuí joined the official counting of cases, and,

272

most probably, the absence of cases before this date explains the non-change in the percentage of social

273

distancing (respected its natural peaks on Sundays).

274

On March 19 th the city administration issued its most restrict decree in the analyzed period,

275

which restricted public transport, closed stores, suspended classes at public and private schools and

276

university, and established protocols for restaurants and other services for one week [9]. This is evidenced

277

when on March 22nd the MSDI reached its highest value, by 70.2%. After that, other decrees were also

278

issued, but with relaxing restrictions. In parallel, the Federal Government of Brazil has been minimizing

279

this pandemic and, in most cases, stimulating the population to keep their regular routine [21]. Thus, after

280

the highest social distancing already registered, it is possible to observe a continuous reduction of the

281

distancing, to the point that at the end of June, we have a value very close to that recorded at the

282

beginning of the analyzed period, when there were no cases in Ijuí and not even in Brazil [22,23].

283

In the last days of June, it is possible to observe a slight increase in the distancing, most

284

probably a consequence of a high number of new cases reported in the second half of June, which have

285

demanded the city administration to review its protocols and be stricter [9]. The mean of the MSDI for the

286

total period of mobile monitoring is 38.5%. If we take into consideration that was classified as “stayed at

287

home” when the mobile did not move more than 450m (radius) [10], it is possible that the actual social

288

distancing level in Ijuí most probably rounds below 30% in regular times, since this distance allows

289

neighborhood social interactions, including small markets, which strongly points that the social distancing

290

is currently low in the city.

291

Our results about SDA and DPR may be related to the official recommendations by local and

292

state governments. The state of RS has implemented since May 10th, the “Controlled Social Distancing

293

Model” (CSDM), to avoid the COVID-19 outbreak considering recommendations for economic activities.

294

In color flags, which ranges from a yellow flag (to represent a low risk to infection and high health care

295

capacity) to a black flag (to represent a high risk of transmission rate and high occupation rates in the

296

hospitals and intensive care units). Thus, since May 10th, every city is classified according to this model

297

to represent the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak [7]. Ijuí was set as a yellow flag from May 10th to

298

June 8th, when it became orange (one level above of risk) because of the rapid increase in the number of

299

cases (95 new cases) and the hospitalization rates in one week (1 to 5 subjects) and then decreased the

300

recovered-to-active ratio cases in Ijuí. Also, it was noticed one death and decreased in the intensive care

301

unit vacancy. As a local initiative to counteract the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ijuí Municipal Decree

302

number 7.107 (of June 16th) improved the recommendations to avoid community transmission [9]. In

303

detail, the decree allows the maintenance of regular service in restaurants (between 7 a.m and 23 p.m.)

304

with reduced capacity, while snack bars and coffee shops were allowed to work only in the delivery or

305

drive-thru mode. The non-essential commercial was authorized to operate; however, they can only receive

306

one customer per employee, respecting the limits established in the occupation and operation protocols. It

307

is allowed to operate the facilities of sports clubs exclusively for the physical conditioning of the

308

respective contracted professional athletes, observing the minimum distance of two meters between them.

309

Physical contact or agglomerations being prohibited in any case [9]. Thus, the measured social distancing

310

in Ijuí may be in accordance with theses official recommendations but was insufficient to avoid the rapid

311

increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. (For Ijuí urban geographic details, please see Supplementary

312

material figure S1, with geographic localization of COVID-19 cases in June and August).

313

Social distancing measures adopted by the population appear effective, mainly when

314

implemented in conjunction with the distancing of cases and quarantining of contacts [19,24]. Our data

315

showed that preventive behavior, related to the SDA recommendation and DPR, did not reach 70% of

316

social distancing in any of the four steps of the survey. We mentioned this goal since it was proposed

317

early that maintaining the capacity of social distancing at a maximum of 76% could avoid the death of

318

90,000 individuals and the overwhelm of the intensive care units in São Paulo (Brazil)[25]. Nowadays,

319

São Paulo registered more than 20,000 COVID-19 cases and 9,00 deaths [23], suggesting that

320

maintaining and strengthening current social distancing measures, quarantining and isolating cases, is

321

absolutely vital to avoid the collapse of the healthcare systems in the country. Also, it has been suggested

322

that a more restrictive recommendation can be more effective in reducing the number of infected subjects

323

[1,25–28].

324

At the end of June, Brazil reached more than 1.4 million COVID-19 cases [22,23]. The state of

325

RS provides data about COVID-19, which computes on date June 30th 26,941 COVID-19 cases,

326

representing a mean of incidence in the state of 344 cases per 100,000 inhabitants [7]. From June to July,

327

RS decreased the hospitalization rate from 13% to 11%, while increased the death proportion from 2.3 to

328

2,5% (nowadays reached 8,5 per 100,000 inhabitants). If we consider the same rates of cases,

329

hospitalization, and deaths, Ijuí could have 287 cases, 31 hospitalizations and 7 deaths. In fact, the

330

number of cases (n = 283) is similar than RS prevalence, however, Ijuí has less hospitalizations (n = 27)

331

and deaths (n = 1), and Ijuí ends the month of June with 80.8% intensive care units occupied, with three

332

COVID-19 patients [7,9].

333

We compare our “optimistic” prediction (reducing by 50%, R = 0.79) for 120 days after the 100th

334

COVID-19 case with the nowadays Ijuí presented COVID-19 profile: the infection peak was predicted

335

with 75 simultaneous cases and with 52 hospitalizations, however, Ijuí has now (August 6th means ~60

336

days after the 100th COVID-19 case) 156 subjects under recovering and 8 hospitalized patients (the total

337

of hospitalized patients until now was 49 of hospitalizations, which means 9,4% of cases). Also, our

338

predictions showed that 120 days after the 100th COVID-19 case, Ijuí would have a total of 27 deaths.

339

Until now, it was registered five deaths. This comparison allows us to infer that the population followed

340

the recommendations to avoid the transmission of the coronavirus, at least in part, since real cases,

341

hospitalizations and deaths are approximately as predicted by a reduction in the transmission rate below

342

1.0 (R = 0.79).

343

In our study, we showed the profile of hospitalizations by age and sex, and also informed the

344

profile of the subject that was fatally affected by coronavirus. Thus, our study and up-to-date COVID-19

345

data preliminary indicates an increased risk for developing a severe form of COVID-19 related to the

346

presence of comorbidities, advanced age, and sex (men). It is remarkable that pre-existing comorbidities

347

are strikingly evident (about half of patients), hypertension being the most prevalent (30 %), followed by

348

diabetes (19 %), coronary heart disease (8 %) and 3% of individuals presenting previous pulmonary

349

condition, such as chronic obstructive lung disease [29,30]. COVID 19 patients bearing previous

350

comorbidities were also among those with highest mortality rates, with adjusted OR of 7.42 (CI95%:

351

6.33-8.79) for hypertensive patients, 9.03 (CI95%: 7.39-11.35) for diabetic subjects, 12.83 (CI95%:

352

10.27-15.86) for coronary heart disease, while for chronic obstructive lung disease OR is 7.79 (CI95%:

353

5.54-10.43) [31]. Also, it was reported that 31 % of cases, 45 % of hospitalizations, 53 % of intensive

354

care unit (ICU) admissions, and 80 % of deaths occurred among subjects aged 65 years or older [32]. In

355

the same direction, the case-fatality rates among individuals aged 80 years or older are approximately

356

20% [33]. It is noteworthy the discrepancy between males (ca. 60 %) and females at the admission in

357

hospitals. Among non-survivors, this difference is even bigger: ca. 70 % are men [1]. In the Lombardy

358

Region, Italy, these figures are still more impressive: 82 % of the patients admitted to intensive care units

359

(ICU) were older men [32]. The increased risk of this profile (male, older and cardiovascular disease

360

subject) may be related to an impaired immune-metabolism cell stress response. Thus, these subjects

361

cannot resolve virus-induced inflammatory burst physiologically (since there is no medicine) being

362

susceptible to exacerbated forms of inflammation [34], which leads to a fatal “cytokine storm” [35,36].

363

Thus, it is necessary to observe in future studies the adherence to a protective behavior linked to social

364

distancing associated with the presence of comorbidities [3,37]. The preventive behavior in older subjects

365

and people with chronic diseases in the community may avoid higher levels of hospitalization or high

366

mortality rates.

367

Conclusion

368

The insufficient social distancing registered in the population-based study may be related to the rapid

369

increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijuí. These data predict a closer outbreak of community infection of

370

COVID-19, which could be avoided or attenuated if the levels of the social distancing of population

371

increase in the next weeks.
