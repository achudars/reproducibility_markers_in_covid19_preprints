ABSTRACT
Background: Understanding the pathophysiology of respiratory failure (ARDS) in coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) patients is of utmost importance for the development of therapeutic strategies and
identification of risk factors. Since we observed clinical and histopathological similarities between
COVID-19 and lung manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD) in our clinical practice, aim
of

the

present

study

is

to

analyze

a

possible

role

of

autoimmunity

in

SARS-CoV-2-associated

respiratory failure.
Methods: In this prospective, single-center trial, we enrolled 22 consecutive patients with RT-PCRconfirmed

We

performed

10/11 (91.9%) COVID-19 patients who required ICU treatment, but in 4/11 (36.4%) patients with mild

PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS
In the present study, we included all consecutive patients with positive SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR (mucosal
swab, pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage) admitted to the Bundeswehrkrankenhaus Ulm in March
and April 2020 after obtaining informed consent. Cases without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as
well as cases without/ weak symptoms and no need for hospitalization were excluded. A timeline of

ethics committee of the University of Ulm (ref. no. 129-20) and conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Statistical methods
Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize the data. Medians and interquartile ranges
were used to announce results. Counts and percentages were employed to represent categorial
variables. Student’s t-test was used for the comparison of continuous variables, while Chi-SquareTest/Fisher’s test was used for categorical varoiables. All statistical analyses were conducted using
GraphPad PRISM 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). A p-value<0.05 was regarded as
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Baseline clinical characteristics
Baseline clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients included in the current study are
briefly summarized in

Table 1.

The median follow-up period in the present study cohort was 25.5

days (range 1-42 days, 25% percentile 21.0 days; 75% percentile 30.0 days). Median age at initial
diagnosis was 69.0 years (range, 28 - 88 years). A majority of patients was male (12/22 cases; 54.5%).

Preexisting oncological or immunosuppressive diseases were present in 7/22 cases (31.8%). The most
frequent preexisting illness was cardiovascular disease (10/22 cases; 45.5%). Spontaneous breathing
was sufficient in 9/22 patients, whereas oxygen supply via nasal cannula was required in 3/22 cases.
13/22 cases (59.1%) presented with or developed ARDS according to the ‘’Berlin-definition’’

Antiviral treatment/inhibition of autophagy was applied in 4/22 (18.2%) patients. Median duration of
these approaches was 3 days (range 2-10 days). The toxicity profile was moderate and predominantly
nephrotoxic in nature with 2 cases of acute kidney injury Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome

Supplementary Table 2). There was high procoagulant

activity shown by elevated levels of fibrinogen (100.0%; median 5.16 g/l; range 2.74 - 9.00 g/l) and Ddimers (71.4%; median 1.48 mg/l; range 0.31 - 30.00 mg/l). Elevated levels of CRP (76.2%), IL-6
(85.7%) and TNF-alpha (100.0%) were found in the majority of cases. Lymphopenia was present in
16/22 cases (72.7%).

Screening for autoantibodies revealed positive ANA titers in the majority of cases with moderate or
severe ARDS and in 90.9 % (10/11) ICU cases compared to 36.4% (4/11) non-ICU cases (p=0.024). The
distribution and type of AAB titers among the ICU/non-ICU patients is shown in

patient with detectable autoantibodies (#18, ANA 1:320) died from severe ARDS and pulmonary

higher age and male sex, although not significant. AAB positivity, however, was associated with a
necessity of assisted/invasive ventilation (p=0.037) and occurrence of severe complications (p=0.31).
Distribution of typical or atypical patterns in CT imaging were not different between patients with
and without AABs. There was no significant association between AAB status and disease-specific
survival in the investigated cohort.

Imaging and Histopathology
“Typical” radiologic COVID-19 patterns were found in 53,3% of patients (ICU: 55,6%/non-ICU: 50%).
These included ground glass opacities (all “typical” cases), consolidation and COP-like pattern (

Atypical/negative patterns were found in 44,4% of ICU and 50% of non-ICU patients. Bronchoscopy

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of autoantibodies in a cohort of 22 consecutive
patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and possible correlations with clinical,
radiologic

and

histopathological

findings.

We

show

that

the

presence

of

AABs

is

significantly

associated with the necessity for ICU treatment and invasive ventilation as well as occurrence of
severe complications in these patients;

noteworthy, every ICU patient in the

present study had

detectable autoantibodies and/or history of autoimmune disease. With respect to baseline clinical
characteristics, the investigated cohort is comparable to previous reports

[2,3]

. Notably, in our study,

ICU patients/patients with severe clinical course or patients with AABs were not significantly older or
had more preexisting comorbidities compared to patients with a mild clinical course of the disease or
AAB-negative patients, respectively. However, we could confirm a high rate of lymphopenia as well
as elevated LDH levels in COVID-19 patients, consistent with data from the literature

[2]

. While we

can confirm from our cohort that hyperfibrinogenemia and elevated D-dimers are frequent in COVID19 patients, only two patients presented with thromboembolic events. Given the fact that only
hospitalized patients were included, it is not surprising that the mortality rate (18.2%) was higher
compared to the general population.

finding of AABs in patients with a severe course of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether these
AAB were already present in predisposed patients prior to infection or if transient appearance of
AABs is induced by the virus, as has been described for different types of viral infections

[24]

. A

possible epiphenomenon has therefore to be discussed. However, it is unlikely that the transient
development of a non-specific ANA-IgG titer as a “price to pay”

during the fight against SARS-CoV-2

infection would occur and reach titers of up to 1:1000 in such limited time

the non-ICU patients showed AAB despite

However, we cannot exclude that a certain COVID-19-specific immunogenic stimulus contributes to
the development of AABs in a subgroup of patients, which would still offer the possibility to stratify
patients according to their individual risk at an early point during the course of the disease.

[28]

. From our perspective, higher ANA titers in African Americans might therefore contribute to the

development of severe clinical courses of COVID-19.

There is an ongoing debate with regard to a possible dysregulation of the immune system by SARSCoV-2, and it has been discussed whether anti-inflammatory drugs might be beneficial to prevent

[29]

potentially harmful hyperinflammation

. Previous studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses

activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), followed by a release of IFNα
and functional exhaustion of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL)

NKG2A

was

identified as a potential immunotherapeutic target that may prevent from functional exhaustion of
CTLs and contributes to elimination of cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 while several antiviral treatment
approaches did not improve clinical outcome significantly in COVID-19 patients with moderate or
severe ARDS

[30]

. In line with that, upregulation of NKG2A is a marker for functional exhaustion of

CTLs in cancer patients and patients suffering from chronic viral infections. These mechanisms show
high similarity

to the

development and

of connective

which

methylprednisolone treatment was associated with a more favourable outcome among the patients
who had already developed ARDS [2]. It would be interesting to evaluate if patients with SLE-like AAB
pattern (ANA, anti-ds-DNA) profit from chloroquine, while patients with an SSc-like AAB pattern
(anti-Scl, anti-centromer) might respond to cyclophosphamide. However, the correct timing and dose
for any immunosuppressive treatment approach in response to a viral infection remains unclear.

To our best knowledge, we are the first to show relevant AAB titers in patients with a severe course
of COVID-19. Together with the heterogeneity in radiologic and histopathologic findings we present
here, our results point towards a possible dysregulation of the immune response upon SARS-CoV-2
