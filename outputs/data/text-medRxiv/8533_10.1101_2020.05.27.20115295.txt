A control approach to the Covid-19 disease
using a SEIHRD dynamical model
Fernando Pazos∗and Flavia E. Felicioni†
May 27, 2020

Abstract
The recent worldwide epidemic of Covid-19 disease, for which there
is no vaccine or medications to prevent or cure it, led to the adoption
of public health measures by governments and populations in most of
the affected countries to avoid the contagion and its spread. These
measures are known as nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and
their implementation clearly produces social unrest as well as greatly
affects the economy. Frequently, NPIs are implemented with an intensity quantified in an ad hoc manner. Control theory offers a worthwhile tool for determining the optimal intensity of the NPIs in order to
avoid the collapse of the healthcare system while keeping them as low
as possible, yielding in a policymakers concrete guidance. We propose
here the use of a simple proportional controller that is robust to large
parametric uncertainties in the model used.

Keywords: Covid-19 disease. SEIR model. Nonlinear systems. Proportional control.

Introduction

The novel SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, which produces the disease known as
Covid-19, was first reported on December 2019 in Wuhan, province of Hubei,
China. With amazing speed it spread to the majority of the countries in the

world. The outbreak has been declared as a public health emergency of
international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Jan. 30,
2020 and as a pandemic on March 11.
At the moment, there is no vaccine against this virus or effective medicines
to cure the disease. Health systems only try to mitigate its consequences to
avoid complications and fatal outcomes. This disease showed a great capacity
of contagion and high fatality rates (see updated reports in [WM2]).
Patients affected by this disease experience a number of symptoms, not
all clearly identified at the moment, but which are mainly cough, breathing
difficulties, fever, loss of taste and smell and extreme tiredness. Frequently,
patients develop a form of viral pneumonia that requires hospitalization and
artificial mechanical ventilation in intensive care units. The large number of
patients affected by this disease threatens to collapse public health systems,
increasing the fatality rates by lack of available health assistance.
In this context, is very important to predict the trend of the epidemic
in order to plan effective strategies to avoid its spread and to determine its
impact. As the contagion is produced very easily by simple contact between
people, several measures were adopted by the governments, public health systems and populations in order to reduce the transmission by reducing contact
rates. Examples of these measures, the so called nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) adopted during this period include the closing of schools,
churches, bars, factories, quarantine or physical-distancing policies, confinement of people in their homes, lockdown, among other social impositions
that produce discomfort and clearly harm the economy.
This goal sparked many articles and studies recently published on the
epidemic behavior. A number of them are addressed towards determining a
mathematical model that represents the dynamics of different agents involved
in a population affected by the disease. The dynamic described by the model
aims to make possible to answer crucial issues, such as the maximum number
of individuals that will be affected by the disease and when that maximum
will occur, and makes key predictions concerning the outbreak and eventual
recovery from the epidemic. This information allows to devise public policies
and strategies to mitigate the social impact and reduce the fatality rate.
The seminal work [FLNG+ 20] exemplifies and analyses different strategies to
control the transmission of the virus.
Most of the models adopted to represent the dynamical behavior of the
Covid-19 are based on the SIR model (see [Abd20] and references therein).
The SIR model is a basic representation widely used which describes key
epidemiological phenomena. It assumes that the epidemic affects a constant
population of N individuals. The model neglects demography, i.e. births

and deaths by other causes unrelated to the disease1 .
The population is broken into three non-overlapping groups corresponding
to stages of the disease:
• Susceptible (S). The population susceptible to acquire the disease.
• Infected (I). The population that has acquired the virus and can infect
others.
• Recovered (R). The population that has recovered from infection and
presumed to be no longer susceptible to the disease2 .
A brief description of these compartments is given below. Susceptible
people are those who have no immunity and they are not infected. An individual in group S can move to group I by infection produced through contact
with an infected individual. Group I are people who can spread the disease
to susceptible people. Finally, an infected individual recovered from the disease is moved from the group I to the group R. Some references (see, for
example [LZG+ 20, SSB20]) considers the group R as removed population, or
closed cases, which includes those who are no longer infectious from recovery
and the ones who died from the disease. The summation of these three compartments in the SIR model remains constant and equals the initial number
of population N .
In order to describe better the spread of epidemics, many works (see,
for example [Kan20, GV20, SHD20, Nes20]) adopted the SEIR model. In the
SEIR model a fourth group denoted as Exposed (E) is added between the
group S and the group I:
• Exposed (E). The population that has been infected with the virus,
but not yet in an infective stage capable of transmitting the virus to
others.
This compartment is dedicated to those people who are infectious but they
do not infect others for a period of time namely incubation or latent period.
Other works (see [Abd20] for example) consider an additional compartment at the end of the SIR or of the SEIR model to distinguish between
recovered and death cases:
• Dead (D). The population dead due to the disease.
In Argentina, the daily death rate is 2.055 10−5 .
At the moment, in the Covid-19 disease is an open question if a recovered person can
get re-infected. Even though some cases were recently reported, the reinfection rate value
appears to be statistically negligible based on early evidence.

Thus, these models become the SIRD or the SEIRD models, respectively.
Other works as [TBT+ 20,LZG+ 20,SSB20] consider the existence of other
groups seeking to match the models proposed with the numbers obtained
from the actual Covid-19 disease.
The work presented in [GBB+ 20] deserves to be mentioned. This work
studies the evolution of the Covid-19 in Italy, and proposes a model denoted
as SIDARTHE, where the letters correspond to eight groups denoted as Susceptible, Infected, Diagnosed, Ailing, Recognized, Threatened, Healed and
Extinct respectively. All of them are subgroups of those presented in the
SEIR model. This model discriminates between detected and undetected
cases of infection, either asymptomatic or symptomatic, and also between
different severity of illness, having a group for moderate or mild cases and
another one for critical cases that require hospitalization in intensity care
units. The authors affirm that the distinction between diagnosed and nondiagnosed is important because nondiagnosed individuals are more likely to
spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the later are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and the seriousness of the epidemic phenomena. The fact of considering more groups in
the SIDARTHE model than in the SEIR model allows better discrimination
between the different agents involved in the epidemic evolution, as well as
a better differentiation of the role played by each one. However, the fact of
considering more groups implies the knowledge of more rates, probabilities
and constants that determine the dynamics between the groups. Many of
these values are difficult to know in practice, as well as to estimate the population of some groups, such as Ailing (symptomatic infected undetected).
The authors choose these constants and quantities to match the model to
the actual data. Of course, in order to achieve the goal of better determining
public policies, we believe that the existence of some of these groups in the
model used is not necessary.
In order to better guide the determination of public policies to mitigate
the spread of the virus we propose the use of the control theory.
Control theory has been successfully implemented in several areas other
than physical systems control, for which it was initially designed. For example in economics, ecological and biological systems, many works demonstrate
the success of its implementation. Of course, regardless of the area focused,
a good control strategy depends on the adequate modeling of the dynamical
system to be controlled.
The proposal to use control in this epidemic is not new. It has been first
presented in [SHD20]. In this work, the authors use the SEIR model to show
that a simple feedback law can manage the response to the pandemic for

maximum survival while containing the damage to the economy. However,
the authors illustrate with several examples the benefits of using feedback
control, but they do not present the mathematical control laws as well as they
do not prove the convergence of the trajectories in the closed loop system.
Examples are implemented by mean of several computational experiments
which illustrate the different strategies proposed.
We propose here the use of a simple proportional controller, a standard
tool in control theory, to calculate the control action. This variable guides
how to determine NPIs in order to avoid the collapse of the health system
while reducing the damage to the society and the economy that NPIs inevitably produce.

The SEIHRD model

This section is addressed to model adequately the disease. A suitable model
should avoid making unnecessary classifications in order to obtain key data
on the behavior of the epidemic. These data include number of deaths,
maximum number of infected people, time at which the maximum infection
rate will occur, among other information useful to prevent and reduce the
damage produced by the outbreak.
The SEIR model assumes that exposed people have been infected but are
not able to transmit the virus before a latency period. We will consider that
those people continue to be in the susceptible group S, whereas we consider
the group E as people who have been infected but have no symptoms yet
and are capable of transmitting the virus. Of course, part of this group
will present symptoms after an incubation time (moving to the group I) and
another part will remain asymptomatic. Asymptomatic people who have
been diagnosed as positive also will be considered in the group I, so this
group includes all known positive cases, symptomatic or not.
In addition, a critical issue is the number of infected people who need
hospitalization, because the public policies must try to keep this number
lower than the capacity of the health care system in order to avoid its collapse.
Thus we define an extra group:
• Hospitalized (H). The infected population who need hospitalization.
In the group H we do not differentiate between people hospitalized in mild
condition and those in intensive care units (ICUs), despite the fact that the
number of people in the last subgroup is a critical problem due to an even
more limited capacity in ICUs.

Figure 1: Rate processes that describes the progress between the groups in
the SEIHRD model.
We also consider the population number N as a constant, as the SEIR
model does.
The progression of this epidemic can be modeled by the rate processes
described in Fig. 1.
The proposed SEIHRD model for the spread of the Covid-19 disease in an
uniform population is given by the following deterministic equations, which
are presented normalized with respect to the total population N .
Ṡ = −(1 − u) (αSE + βSI) − νS
Ė = (1 − u) (αSE + βSI) − (γp1 + ζ(1 − p1 ))E

Ṙ = νS + ζ(1 − p1 )E + η(1 − p2 )I + µ(1 − p3 )H
Ḋ = p3 H

The groups S, E, I, R, H and D are the state variables of the dynamical
system (1). They are always nonnegative. The time derivatives Ṙ and Ḋ
are also nonnegative, because recovered people and death cannot decrease,
whereas Ṡ is always nonpositive, because we consider that recovered people
cannot be reinfected. This fact is represented in Fig. 1 because the states
R and D only have input arrows and the state S only has an output arrow.
The model (1) is a nonlinear system normalized with respect the population
N , considered as a constant. Hence S + E + I + H + R + D = 1 and

Ṡ + Ė + I˙ + Ḣ + Ṙ + Ḋ = 0. The system (1) presents an equilibrium point
in [S E I H R D]∗ = [S̄ 0 0 0 R̄ D̄], where S̄, R̄ and D̄ are positive values.
The rate processes are modeled as follows.
• αSE and βSI are the transmission rates of the virus between the susceptible and the exposed population (respectively, infected population).
α and β are the probability of disease transmission in a single contact
with exposed (infected) people times the average daily number of contacts per person and have units of 1/day. Typically, α is grater than
β, assuming that people tend to avoid contact with subjects showing symptoms or diagnosed as positive. Contacts between susceptible
people and hospitalized people are neglected, excepting for healthcare
workers. The probability of contagion from dead people is also neglected, despite the fact that some cases were recently reported. Of
course, recovered people are no longer able to transmit the virus.
• u ∈ [0, 1] is the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions (NPIs). u = 0 means no intervention and the epidemic grows
completely free, whereas u = 1 implies total elimination of the disease
spread.
• ν is the vaccination rate, at which susceptible people became unable to
be infected. Unfortunately, in the Covid-19 case ν = 0 yet.
• p1 is the probability that exposed people develop symptoms, γ −1 is the
average period to develop symptoms, and ζ −1 is the average time to
overcome the disease staying asymptomatic.
• p2 is the probability that infected people with symptoms require hospitalization, δ −1 is the average time between infection and the need
for hospitalization, and η −1 is the average time in that infected people
recover without hospitalization.
• p3 is the probability of hospitalized people die, −1 is the average time
between the hospitalization and the death, and µ−1 is the average time
to recover after hospitalization.
The parameters used in (1) are not very precisely determined and even
differ greatly in the literature consulted (see [FLNG+ 20, LGWSR20, Kan20,
LZG+ 20, GBB+ 20, Jon19, Org] among many other references). Most of the
model adopted in the references adjust these parameters to match real data
from different countries. It must be taken into account that some of these

parameters, mainly α and β, are not independent either from the populations
and their general health status or their actions.
The parameters α and β are related with the basic reproduction number
R0 , defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single
(typical) infection in a completely susceptible population [Jon19]. R0 is not
a fixed number, depending as it does on such factors as the density of a
community, the general health of its populace, or its medical infrastructure
[SHD20]. This is the most important parameter to understand the spread of
an epidemic. If R0 > 1, the epidemic growths and the number of infected
people increases. If R0 < 1, the epidemic decreases and after a certain time
disappears, when a large enough number of people acquire antibodies and
the so-called herd immunity occurs.
In the actual Covid-19 disease, R0 was determined to be 2.6 in Wuhan,
China [SHD20] (between 2.2 and 2.7 according to [SLX+ 20]), ranging from
2.76 to 3.25 in Italy [SHD20] and even close to 3.28 [LGWSR20]. An important remark is that many works consider R0 depending on the NPIs,
admitting that these actions tend to reduce this number because the contact
rates between people decrease. Note that NPIs always occur even in countries
where no government action has been taken, because people spontaneously
tend to stay at home and to avoid contact with others. This fact explains the
disparity of this number in different countries and reported in the references
(see [LGWSR20]).
Here, we consider R0 as a constant reproduction number in the absence of
any external action, i.e., as if the disease could spread completely free, which,
of course, is an unrealistic scenario. Specifically, the relation between the
rates α and β and R0 , can be calculated in model (1) as in [Jon19,GBB+ 20],
resulting
R0 =

(η+δ p2 −η p2 )(ζ+γ p1 −p1 ζ)

(2)

In section 3 we propose a pair of values for parameters α and β to evaluate
different epidemic scenarios.
The effectiveness of the NPIs is considered in the variable u, which determines
the rate at which susceptible people become exposed.
Several works [LZG+ 20,TBT+ 20,GV20,SSB20] consider these parameters
as time dependent, because incorporate in these parameters the impact of
governmental actions among other NPIs.
The incubation period is estimated as γ −1 = 5.1 days [Kan20, FLNG+ 20,
TWL+ 20].
The probability of developing symptoms p1 will be roughly estimated as

50% [MKZC20, FLNG+ 20]3 .
The period to overcome the disease without presenting symptoms is ζ −1 =
14.7 days (deduced from [GBB+ 20]).
The infectious period with no need of hospitalization is widely accepted
as 14 days, so η = 1/14.
The probability to need hospitalization after the infection is p2 = 19%
[Low20,LZG+ 20,SSB20], and the time from symptom onset to hospitalization
is δ −1 = 5.5 days [SLX+ 20].
The probability to die after hospitalization is p3 = 15% according to
[WM2, FLNG+ 20], and the average time to die is −1 = 11.2 days [SLX+ 20].
The average time to recovery after hospitalization is µ−1 = 16 days
[FLNG+ 20].
Finally, as it was noted above, there is no vaccine against this disease, so
ν = 0.
Remark 2.1 Of course, most of these parameters are subject to large inaccuracies, and they differ greatly in the literature consulted. However, as
we will show below, the proposed control method is robust for such uncertainties as well as for measurements errors characterized as unreported or
undiagnosed cases and inaccuracies in the group quantities.

The control strategy

We propose the use of control theory to determine public nonpharmaceuticals interventions (NPIs) in order to control the evolution of the epidemic,
avoiding the collapse of health care systems while minimizing harmful effects
on the population and on the economy.
As noted in [SHD20], “a properly designed feedback-based policy that
takes into account both dynamics and uncertainty can deliver a stable result
while keeping the hospitalization rate within a desired approximate range.
Furthermore, keeping the rate within such a range for a prolonged period
allows a society to slowly and safely increase the percentage of people who
have some sort of antibodies to the disease because they have either suffered
it or they have been vaccinated, preferably the latter”.
The action law is given by the control variable u in (1). No intervention
from the public health agencies means u = 0, and the disease evolves naturally without control. At the other hand u = 1 means the total impossibility
of transmitting the virus, which, of course, is an unrealistic scenario.
3
This probability is the most difficult to determine. According to [Low20] up to 80%
of the cases could be asymptomatic.

There are several possible choices of the reference signal or set point of the
control system. One of them may be a small enough number of hospitalized
people to not affect the capacity of the intensive care units (ICUs) available
in the health care system. This reference signal maybe nonconstant, it can
can go up because of an increase in available beds due to capacity additions
in the health care system, by creation of provisory field hospitals, among
other similar measures. By other hand, we must bear in mind that the quantities of each group described in (1) are subject to large inaccuracies, due
to unreported or undiagnosed cases, except for the number of people diagnosed as positive (I), which is quite well known, the number of hospitalized
people (H) and, of course, the number of deaths (D). For that reason the
output variable to be fed back only can be the infected population I or the
hospitalized population H.
Hence, the goal of the control action is to keep the number of hospitalized
people lower than the set point minimizing the external intervention which
produces social discomfort and clearly harm the economy.
Therefore, the control action should aim to solve the following constrained
optimization problem:
R
min T u(τ )∂τ
s.t. H < SP
where T is a considered period and SP is the reference signal (or set point,
in the case it is considered as a constant).
As a reference, the World Health Organization recommends a number of
80 hospital beds per 10000 population, which means an index of 0.008, or
0.8%. This number will be used as the SP of the closed loop control system.
However, we must bear in mind that NPIs impact on physical contacts
between susceptible and infected or exposed people. If an individual is already infected, hospitalization will be required after at most δ −1 = 5.5 days
or after δ −1 + γ −1 = 10.6 days on average if the infection was recent. Hence,
there exists a delay between the adoption of NPIs and their consequences on
hospitalization of people. If the control action if calculated based only on the
number of hospitalized people, the following 10.6 days too many people may
require hospitalization, exceeding the capacity for medical care. In control
jargoon, it means that there are almost two weeks with the system operating
in an open loop. Therefore, the control action needs to be calculated as a
function of the number of infected people I (the number of exposed people
E is quite unknown) in order to avoid future hospitalization requirements in
the next 10.6 days at most. This strategy is known as predictive control.
Fig. 2 shows the closed loop control system. The variable process is the
infected population I and the control signal is the effectiveness of the NPI

Of course, in practical situations it is necessary to determine which actions
and at what level correspond to a certain effectiveness of NPIs, but this issue
is outside the scope of this paper.
Next, we show the results of different strategies of NPIs applied on the
SEIHRD model.

3.1

An open loop control system

In this first series of experiments, we apply a constant control action u, that
is, the system shown in Fig. 2 is an open loop control one.
We consider as initial conditions I = E = 0.001, H = R = D = 0, so
S = 0.998, that is, 0.1% of the population is diagnosed as positive the first
day and 0.1% of the population is asymptomatic infected.
During the first days of the epidemic, it was logical to consider that
both exposed and infected people could spread the virus at the same ratio
because the contagion between humans was not known. Then, this disease
could spread in a completely free scenario, in which no action is taken. This
scenario has been called “naif ” by several authors [SSB20, LZG+ 20].
Using the expression (2) with R0 =2.8 as in [SSB20,LZG+ 20], and assuming that no actions are taken during the epidemic, then α=β=0.1786. The
evolution of exposed, infected, hospitalized and dead people in this case is
shown in the Fig. 3.
In this “naif ” scenario, and using as initial condition 1 infected and 1
exposed person for different population values (N > 1, 000), the maximum
are always 17.75% for the exposed and 15.75% for the infected, and the times
when these maximums are reached depend on the population value N as is
shown in the Fig. 4. The delay between both maximums is a constant value

is about 5.17% of the total population.
Clearly, this “naif ” scenario seemed to be unrealistic since people tend to
avoid contact with subjects showing symptoms or diagnosed as positive due
to the severity of the Covid-19 disease. In consequence, as we stated before,
in a more realistic scenario α is greater than β. In the rest of this paper we
consider β = α/2 to take into account this assumption.

NPI actions for illustrative purposes (with β = α/2).

adopted (u = 0) approximately 81% of the population will be infected and
4.57% will die. On the other hand, a relatively little aggressive NPI, only
40% of effectiveness, is efficient in reducing the final number of deaths as
well as the maximum number of hospitalized people, which is a crucial issue
in order not to collapse the health system (the maximum value of H reaches
the SP ). Moreover, a late application of this strategy, after 4 weeks since
the first case arose, also significantly reduces these numbers.

3.2

A proportional controller

In this section, we simulate the behavior of the trajectories described by
the normalized system (1) subject to a proportional control action. The
objective of the control action is that the number of hospitalized people does
not exceed the number of available beds. Of course, this number is highly
variable in different countries, and can be increased during the duration of
the epidemic with the construction of field hospitals, among other resources.
On the other hand, as noted in Sec. 3, to adopt as feedback variable
the number of hospitalized people may lead to an overload of the health
system in the following 10.6 days, for which a predictive control must be used
that consider the number of infected people I. Not all infected people need

hospitalization. Most of the symptomatic cases are mild and remain mild
in severity [Low20, SLX+ 20] (1 − p2 = 81%). So we consider that p2 = 19%
of infected people will need hospitalization in the following δ −1 = 5.5 days.
This number plus the number of people already hospitalized H must remain
below the set point. Of course, we neglect the number of beds occupied by
patients hospitalized for other diseases.
Hence, the proportional control variable is chosen as


SP − H − p2 I
∈ [0, 1]
(3)
u = kp 1 −
SP − H
where kp is the proportional scalar gain with values between [0, 1]. Note that
if I = 0, u = 0, and there is no need of a public intervention because no
one is going to require hospitalization on the following 5.5 days, and with
kp = 1, if a percentage of 19% of the infected people is equal to the number
of available beds SP − H, u = 1 which means that the public intervention
must completely avoid the transmission of the virus because all these people
will require hospitalization after δ −1 = 5.5 days on average. Another point
of view is to consider that this is a tracking trajectory problem, with a time
dependent reference signal equal to r(t) = SP − H(t).
We consider the same initial condition than in the former series of experiments, I = E = 0.001, i.e. 0.1% of the population infected and presenting
symptoms at the first day and we suppose that 0.1% of the population is
infected and asymptomatic.
Fig. 7 shows the trajectories of the variables vs. time with a gain kp = 1.
Note that the number of people hospitalized is always smaller than the set
point.
Fig. 8 shows the control signal vs. time.
The control signal presents a maximum value of 0.8227, and the area
under the curve of the control signal vs. time is 98.8829. Of course, the
smaller this action, the less the damage to the population and to the economy.
The constant control signal equal to 0.4 presents an area under the curve
equal to 100 and equal to 88.8 when it is applied after 4 weeks (see Table 1).
We must bear in mind that NPIs are determined by governmental or
popular decisions, and hardly can change every day as the control signal
calculated by the proportional controller does. Thus, we consider the application of NPIs with effectiveness shown in Fig. 9. The amplitudes and
times of this control signal were obtained from that shown in Fig. 8. The
detail of the trajectories of the states presented in Fig. 10 shows that there
are no significant changes in the results presented. The maximum number of
hospitalized people is 0.0057, the final number of deaths is 0.0132, and the
area under the curve u vs. time is 87.38.

Simulations with uncertain parameters and considering some noncompliance of the nonpharmaceutical interventions

In this section we consider the more realistic situation in which the parameters are partially unknown. As mentioned in Sec. 2 there are large uncertainties in the parameters, they diverge a lot according to the researched
references and they are very different according to the country studied.
In this series of experiments, the parameter α is randomly chosen is also
randomly chosen between 0.15 and 0.6. The parameter β between 0.008 and
0.04. The incubation time γ −1 between 2 and 6 days.The probability to
present symptoms p1 between 40% and 80%. The time of recovering between
14 and 16 days, for both symptomatic or asymptomatic people. The probability to be hospitalized p2 is considered as a Gaussian distribution function
of mean 0.19 and standard deviation of 0.1. The time to be hospitalized
δ −1 is chosen between 3 and 7 days. The probability to die p3 between 10%
and 16%. The time to die −1 between 3 and 12 days. Finally, the time of
recovering from hospitalization µ−1 is randomly chosen between 10 and 20
days.
In addition, we also consider that there exists some noncompliance of
the nonpharmaceutical interventions. Hence, we apply to the system (1) a
control signal with Gaussian distribution of mean 80% of that calculated in
(3) with standard deviation of 10%, that is, we assume that there is 20% on
average of noncompliance with the public measures adopted.
The initial conditions are also I = E = 0.001 and the gain is kp = 1. Fig.
11 shows the trajectories of the states of the model (1) during 250 days since
the first symptomatic case arose.

Table 3 reports some results extracted from this series of simulations.
The similarity of the results reported in Tables 2 and 3, as well as the
trajectories shown in Figs. 7 and 11, show that the proportional controller is
robust to parameter uncertainties and to some noncomplaince of the NPIs,
which, of course, always occurs in practice.

Conclusions

The proportional controller proposed to guide the adoption of NPIs shown
its efficiency to keep the number of hospitalized people below a set point
given by the health system capacity. Moreover, this very simple strategy is
robust to parameters uncertainties and to some level of noncompliance of the

public measures.
The control signal calculated by this method aims to guide the adoption
of NPIs in order of minimizing the social impact and the economical damages.
As an example, recently the Argentine government relaxed some restrictions adopted in the quarantine period, allowing more economic and recreational activities in some cities. The only criterion used to adopt this measure
was the number of days in which the number of infected people doubled (the
so-called doubling time). Even thought this decision also can be considered
as a closed loop control action, the criterion adopted is a little improvised.
An open question is how to translate the rate of effectiveness of the NPI
calculated by the controller into concrete actions adopted by governments
or public health authorities. Moreover, we must bear in mind that these
measures cannot be continuously varied along the time, as the control signal does, but they are decisions that will remain valid for at least few days.
However, although this issue is out of the scope of this paper, some decision
can be changed every day, for example, the number of individuals with permission to leave their homes or the number of people allowed to get into a
store, among other little decisions that can change every day according to
the control variable suggests.
