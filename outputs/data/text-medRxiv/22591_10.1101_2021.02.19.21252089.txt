Abstract
Background: In early March 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the ski resort Ischgl in Austria
initiated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Austria and Northern Europe. In a crosssectional study, we found that the seroprevalence in the adult population of Ischgl had
reached 45% by the end of April. To answer the question of how long immunity persists and
what effect this high-level immunity had on virus transmission, we performed a follow-up
study in early November, 2020.
Methods: Of the 1259 adults that participated in the baseline study, 801 could be included in
the follow-up. The study involved the analysis of binding and neutralizing antibodies and T cell
responses. In addition, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ischgl was compared to the
incidence in similar municipalities in Tyrol throughout 2020.
Findings: For the 801 individuals that participated in both studies, the seroprevalence declined
from 51.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 47.9 - 54.9) to 45.4% (95% CI 42.0 - 49.0). Median
antibody concentrations dropped considerably but antibody avidity increased. T cell
responses were analysed in 93 cases, including all 4 formerly seropositive cases that had lost
antibodies in all assays, three of which still had detectable T cell memory. In addition, the
incidence in the second COVID-19 wave that hit Austria in November 2020, was significantly
lower in Ischgl than in comparable municipalities in Tyrol or the rest of Austria.
Interpretation: This study has important implications as it shows that although antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 declined, T and B cell memory can be detected for up to 8 months. Complemented
by infection prevention measures a level of around 40-45% immunity in Ischgl significantly
reduced local virus transmission during the second wave in Austria in November 2020.
Funding: Funding was provided by the government of Tyrol and the FWF Austrian Science
Fund.

Introduction
Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, it had already become clear that individuals previously
infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are immune to re-infection. Consequently, welldocumented re-infections have been extremely rare to date, one year after the pandemic
emerged 1-3. The question however, of how long this immunity will last, is still controversial.
While some studies report a rapid loss of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 within 2-4 months 4,5,
especially in individuals after mild or asymptomatic infections, newer studies have shown
persistence of antibodies for several months, although levels decline over time 6. In addition,
recent studies show that T cell responses can still be detected 6-8 months after infection and
most individuals after mild and asymptomatic infection retain at least T cell responses or
neutralizing antibodies for up to 16-18 weeks 7,8. The question remains, however, if this level
of immunity protects from re-infection and whether it contributes to herd immunity.
In late April 2020, we studied the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in Ischgl, a popular ski resort
in the Tyrolean Alps 9. Ischgl was hit hard in March 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, and from
Ischgl, the virus spread world-wide, mainly to Northern Europe and to the US 10-12. A total of
1473 individual, incl. 214 children, participated in our April study, corresponding to around
80% of the individuals living in Ischgl (residents and seasonal workers) at that time. We found
that by the end of April 42% of the local population (45% of the adult population) had become
seropositive. This was one of the highest regional seroprevalence levels reported for spring
2020 and most of these seropositive individuals had been infected in March with a drastic
decline of new infections in April.
Here, we report the results of a follow-up study (Ischgl 2) performed in the first week of
November 2020, among adults, 6.5 months after the first study and up to 8 months after the
first infection wave in Ischgl. We found that T-cell and antibody responses could still be
detected in most individuals that had recovered from infection and that very few new
infections occurred from May to December, 2020.
Material and Methods
Study population, study design and recruitment
The ethical committee (EC) of the Medical University of Innsbruck approved the studies,
baseline (Ischgl 1) with EC numbers: 1100/2020 and 1111/2020, which took place between
April 21st and 27th, 2020 and follow-up (Ischgl 2) with EC number: 1330/2020, which took place
between November 2nd and 8th, 2020. This cross-sectional epidemiological survey targeted all
residents of Ischgl/Tyrol older than 18. At baseline, n=1259 adults (82.4%) of all eligible adults
(n=1527) in Ischgl enrolled in the study 9. Of the baseline sample, n=813 (64.6%) entered the
6.5 months follow-up study. A total of n=12 of these cases were excluded from analysis due
to inconsistent age (n=9), no questionnaire (n=2) and no blood sample (n=1). In total, n=91
new participants entered the study at follow up; n=12 of these were <18 years at baseline,
n=1 was excluded due to missing questionnaire data. Data have been collected with Askimed,
a web-based eCRF system for data collection and management.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests
EDTA-plasma was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-binding antibodies using four immunoassays.
Samples were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1-protein IgA and IgG positivity by a
commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA and -IgG ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany),
respectively, using the fully automated 4-plate benchtop instrument Immunomat™
(Virion/Serion, Würzburg, Germany). Results with respect to the obtained optical density (OD)
values were interpreted according to the recommendations in the manufacturer’s
information. For both assays values >1.1 were considered positive. Borderline values (0.8-1.1)
in the Euroimmun IgG ELISA were rated positive, for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA borderline
values were rated as negative. Additionally, each plasma was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2-Nprotein IgG (anti-N IgG) with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay on the ARCHITECT
i2000SR system (Abbott, Illinois, USA). Anti-N IgG was positive, if the obtained relative light
unit (RLU) value corresponded to the manufacturer’s recommendations (>1.4). Anti-N IgG was
additionally quantified using the ElecsysAnti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
USA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. The Roche assay detects antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 N protein using a double-antigen sandwich immunoassay design. This
assay uses a cutoff index (COI), which is calculated using the standards provided by the
manufacturer. A COI of ≥1.0 was considered positive.
Neutralizing antibody-assay
Titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were determined using a replication defective
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described
previously 13. Shortly, VSVΔG-GFP virus was produced on 293T cells stably expressing a Cterminally truncated version of SARS-CoV-2 spike (Wuhan variant). Four-fold serial dilutions
of heat-inactivated plasma were pre-incubated with virus for 1 h at 37°C and subsequently
used to infect 293T-ACE2 cells seeded the previous day. Approximately 16 h after infection,
plates were analyzed in an ImmunoSpot S5 analyzer (C.T.L. Europe, Bonn, Germany) and the
number of GFP positive cells was counted. The last plasma dilution that resulted in a 50%
reduction of GFP positive cells compared to virus only wells was considered as 50%
neutralization titer. Titers of ≤1:4 were considered as negative, titers of ≥1:16 as positive.
Defining seroprevalence and serostatus
Plasma samples were analyzed according to the scheme in Figure 1a. The serostatus of the
samples was defined as p, d, a or n depending on the binding antibody assays:
p = positive = anti-S IgG+ AND anti-N IgG+ (either Roche or Abbott assay positive)
d = discordant = anti-S IgG+ OR anti-N IgG+ (either Roche or Abbott assay)
a = only IgA = only anti-S IgA+ but anti-S IgG- AND anti-N IgGn = negative = anti-S IgG- AND anti-N IgG- AND anti-S IgATo calculate the seroprevalence, all individuals with serostatus p were considered as
seropositive. For serostatus d and a individuals were considered as seropositive when they
had neutralizing antibodies ≥1:16.

Avidity of SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-S IgG
A kit was used according to manufactures instructions to determine of the avidity of anti-S
antibodies (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany, REF: EI 2606-9601 G). Shortly, plasma samples,
in a 1:101 dilution, were added to microplate wells coated with an S1-domain of the spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 and incubated in duplicates for 60 minutes at 37°C. After three washing
steps, the pairs of samples were treated either with 200 µl urea or 200 µl PBS and were further
incubated for 10 minutes. Plates were washed again. For the detection of remaining antibody,
100 µl of peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG were added, incubated for another 30
minutes at 37°C and plates were subsequently washed. For the colorimetric signal detection
TMB substrate was used. Reaction was stopped after a 30-minute incubation at room
temperature and plates were measured at wavelengths of 450 nm (signal) and 620 nm
(reference wavelength for background subtraction) using a Tecan Sunrise Reader (Grödig,
Austria). The relative avidity index (RAI) for each sample corresponded the ratio of the optical
densities (ODs) with and without urea incubation.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses
For details regarding T cell isolation and analysis see supplementary methods.
To study SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses Prot_S, Prot_M and Prot_N SARS-CoV-2
PepTivator (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) peptide pools consisting mainly
of 15-mer sequences with 11 amino acids overlap covering the immunodominant sequence
domains of the surface (or spike) glycoprotein (pepS), and the complete sequence of the
membrane glycoprotein (pepM) as well as the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (pepN) were
used. As positive control PepTivator CEF MHC Class 1 Plus (pepCEF) was used, consisting of
32 MHC class 1-specific peptides of 8-12 amino acids in length derived from human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and influenza A virus. Alternatively, cells
were stimulated with Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma) at a concentration of 10 µg/ml.
To expand SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells, 2106 PBMCs in 500 L of RPMI medium supplemented
with 2% human AB serum were stimulated with 1 µg/ml pepS, pepM or pepN peptide pools
in the presence of 20 U/ml interleukine-2 (IL-2). As negative control, cells were cultured with
IL-2 alone. PepTivator pepCEF at 1 µg/ml in the presence of IL-2 was used as positive control.
At day 3, 500 L fresh RPMI medium supplemented with 2% human AB serum and 40 U/ml IL2 was added. At day 7, cells were harvested and counted. A total of 1105 cells were restimulated with or without 1 µg/ml pepS, pepM or pepN peptide pools. As positive controls,
cells were stimulated with 10 µg/ml PHA or re-stimulated with PepTivator pepCEF at 1 µg/ml.
Specific T cell responses were analyzed in an IFNγ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) or by
intracellular (IC) cytokine and cell surface staining (Supplementary Methods).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed in Stata 16.1 (StataCorp. 2019. Stata Statistical Software:
Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC) and GraphPad Prism version 8.2.0 and 9
(GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Demographic characteristics were tabulated
using descriptive statistics including the calculation of means ± standard deviations (or median

and interquartile range (IQR)) for continuous measures and numbers (%) for categorical
measures. 95% confidence intervals for binomial proportions, including crude prevalence
estimates of seroprevalence, were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson estimation method.
Cross-sectional seroprevalence was calculated in November for the whole sample,
seroprevalence at baseline and follow-up was also calculated for individuals for whom data
was available for both.
Quantitative variables were compared across groups using parametric (ANOVA) and nonparametric methods (Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test). Differences in quantitative
variables at baseline and follow-up were compared using parametric (Student’s t-test for
paired samples, repeated measures ANOVA) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank test)
tests. Associations between categorical variables were tested using χ² test, with Fisher’s exact
test where appropriate. A two-tailed value of p <0.05 was considered statistically significant
for all comparisons.
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ischgl in 2020
We compared daily numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive cases of Ischgl with 13
control municipalities. We selected 5% of all municipalities in the federal state of Tyrol (279
in total) that are most similar to Ischgl in terms of the Mahalanobis distance in covariate space.
The covariates used to calculate the Mahalanobis distance were population size, settlement
area per square km, share of female population, share of people under 16 years, share of
people older than 65 years, number of commuters, share of people with tertiary education,
and hotel bed capacity. The matching approach selected control group municipalities which
are most similar to Ischgl. The selected control municipalities were Eben am Achensee, Ellmau,
Fiss, Gerlos, Lermoos, Leutasch, Mayrhofen, Nauders, Neustift im Stubaital, Seefeld in Tirol,
Serfaus, Sölden, Tux. These are all very tourism-intense holiday towns in Tyrol, and very
comparable to Ischgl in terms of the covariates used. More details on the calculation of the
Mahalanobis distance are available upon request. All calculations were executed with the
software R (version 4.03), and the R-package Synth (8).
To test whether the trends are significantly different between Ischgl and the 13 control
municipalities during the second wave, we estimated an event-study model. In particular, we
divide our daily data into weekly periods starting from September 1st and calculated for each
week the Difference-in-Difference in the 7-day moving average of new cases (per 100,000
inhabitants) between the group of control municipalities and Ischgl. The regression equation
(1) is given by:
𝑦𝑖𝑡,𝑤 = 𝛽𝑖𝑤 + 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛾𝑤 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡,𝑤 (1)
𝑦𝑖𝑡,𝑤 denotes the 7-day moving average of new cases in municipality 𝑖 (Ischgl or the average
control municipality), at day t and week w. 𝛼𝑖 are municipality-fixed effects, 𝛾𝑤 denote week
fixed effects, and 𝜀 is the remainder error term. Our coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝑖𝑤 and measures
the difference in the outcome variable between Ischgl and the control municipalities between
week 𝑤 and the reference period. As reference period we chose the second week of
September, which was several weeks before the second wave hit Austria. Our sample ends at

December 14 and, therefore, included 16 weeks. Thus, we estimated 16 𝛽𝑖𝑤 ′𝑠, which are
plotted in a graph along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Figure 3b)
Results
Study population
In the first week of November 2020, 6.5 months after our first seroprevalence study in the skiresort Ischgl (baseline study = Ischgl 1), we again invited all adult Ischgl residents to participate
in a study on the level of local immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (follow-up study = Ischgl 2). In April,
an estimated 1527 adults lived in Ischgl, of these 1259 participated in Ischgl 1 (82.4%). In
November, an estimated 1304 adults were living in Ischgl, this decrease reflects the absence
of seasonal workers. Of these, 904 adults participated in November (69.3% participation rate).
Of the 1259 study participants at baseline, 801 individuals participated again in November and
were included in the analysis in the follow-up study presented here (63.6%, Supplementary
Figure 1). Age distribution was similar in the adult population in both studies, while there was
a slight bias towards female participants in Ischgl 2 (54.9%) relative to Ischgl 1 (51.9%)
(Supplementary Table 1).
Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were still detectable although the levels declined.
The testing strategy for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is depicted in Figure 1a. IgG antibodies
against spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N) were determined using commercials available
immunoassays, anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) for anti-S IgG,
Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (Abbott, Illinois, USA) and ElecsysAnti-SARS-CoV-2
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, USA) for anti-N IgG. We observed that many individuals had
lost anti-N IgG antibodies in the Abbott anti-N IgG-Abbott test in Ischgl 2, but turned out to
still have anti-N IgG antibodies in the Roche anti-N IgG-Roche assay (Supplementary Table 2).
For individuals negative in all three assays, anti-S IgA antibodies were determined using an
anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). We defined the serostatus groups
p (positive), d (discordant), a (IgA to S protein only), and n (negative in all test), based on the
outcome of the commercial antibody assays as explained in Material and Methods and in
Figure 1a.
For all individuals with serostatus d and a neutralizing antibodies were determined. The
following individuals were considered seropositive: p (anti-S IgG and anti-N IgG positive), d
(discordant) plus neutralizing antibody positive; a (anti-S IgA only) plus neutralizing antibody
positive. We have previously described a seroprevalence of 45.0% (95% CI 42.2 – 47.8) for all
adult participants at Ischgl 1 (n=1259) 9. For the follow-up study, there was a slight bias for
participation of baseline study seropositive individuals, while fewer negative individuals
returned. This resulted in a baseline study seroprevalence of the subpopulation included in
both studies (n=801) of 51.4% (95% CI 47.9 – 54.9). Here, we determined the seroprevalence
for all adult participants at Ischgl 2 (n=891) with 44.7% (95% CI 41.4 to 48.0). For individuals
that participated in both studies (n=801), the level of seropositivity declined between both
studies to 45.4% (95% CI 42.0 - 49.0) in Ischgl 2 (Supplementary Table 3). From the 90
individuals that only participated in Ischgl 2 and not in Ischgl 1, 37.8% (95% CI 27.8 - 48.6) were

seropositive in Ischgl 2 (Supplementary Table 3). The individuals that only participated in Ischgl
2 were not otherwise included in the following analysis.
Median antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 significantly declined in each assay - by 50% in the antiS IgG assay (n = 801, Z =22.0, p< 0.001), 88.9% in the anti-N-IgG-Abbott (n = 801, Z = 19.4, p<
0.001) and 58.6% in the anti-N-IgG-Roche assay (n = 40, Z = -4.4, p< 0.001) (Figure 1 b-d and
Supplementary Table 2). In several individuals, antibodies were lost for one of the antigens
switching from positive “p” to discordant “d” (p-d) (Table 1). Only 4 of 364 (1.1%, 95% CI 0.32.8) individuals with serostatus p (positive for anti-S and anti-N antibodies) in Ischgl 1 were
tested negative in all commercial antibody test kits in Ischgl 2 (group p-n, Table 1).
Interestingly, 3 of the 4 individuals in the p-n group (75%) still retained neutralizing antibodies
(Table 1). Of the 8 sera that were only positive for IgA antibodies to S protein in Ischgl 2, 2 had
neutralizing antibodies (Table 1).
Also the neutralizing antibody titers declined in most individuals that were neutralizing
antibodies positive in Ischgl 1, and 90 of 430 (20.9%, 95% CI 17.2 to 25.1) individuals
completely lost neutralization capacity in our assay (Figure 1f, g). Interestingly, of these 90
individuals that lost neutralizing antibodies in Ischgl 2, 1 had IgA to S, 33 had IgG antibodies to
either N or S and 32 had antibodies to both antigens in the commercial antibody assays.
We then studied the avidity of the antibodies in individuals that were anti-S IgG positive in
Ischgl 1 and 2 (Figure 1h). While the antibody titers to S had declined over time, the avidity
significantly increased as a sign of antibody maturation. Thus, despite the lower concentration
of antibodies in Ischgl 2, the antibodies that persisted show a higher binding strength and
thereby most likely an improved functionality.
T cell response
In Ischgl 1, T cell response had not been analysed. To study if the decline in humoral immunity
was compensated at least partially by T cell responses in Ischgl 2 participants, we analyzed the
response to peptide pools derived from S, M and N protein of SARS-CoV-2 by ELISPOT (Figure
2a, b) and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) analysis (Figure 2c, d). We analyzed a total of 71
antibody positive individuals from Ischgl 1 who remained positive (p-p, n=28, all NTpos),
became discordant (p-d, n=38, 29 NTpos/9 NTneg), or IgA only (p-a, n=1, NTpos) or negative (p-n,
n=4, 3 NTpos/1 NTneg) in Ischgl 2. Individuals that were antibody negative in both studies (n=22,
all NTneg) served as a control group. As positive controls, we used pepCEF and PHA, and T cell
response to these stimulations were comparable in all investigated groups (Supplementary
Figure 2).
Although approximately one third of individuals in the seronegative group showed T cell
responses to at least one peptide pool (Table 2, Figure 2b), the responses were significantly
higher in baseline seropositive individuals (Figure 2a, b, c). The responses to pepM and pepN
pools were not significantly different between the different groups of positive individuals
studied. Stimulation with pepS pool resulted in no significant difference in responses between
n-n and p-d groups, however the response in p-p group was found significantly higher
compared to both n-n and p-d groups. The T cell response was primary elicited by CD4+ T cells

and to a lesser extent by CD8+ T cells for the S and M protein peptide pools, while CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells contributed equally to the response against the N peptide pool (Figure 2c, d).
When analyzing the number of reactive peptide pools, we found significant difference
between baseline antibody negative and positive study groups (Table 2, p=0.007). When
comparing baseline negative participants with baseline positives in the different subsets in
the follow-up, the number of reactive peptide pools in the p-p group but not p-d/NTpos and pd/NTneg groups was significantly higher than in the n-n group (p-p versus n-n p=0.001, pd/NTpos versus n-n p=0.091 and p-d/NTneg versus n-n p=0.261). Thus, T cell response in term
of the number of reactive peptide pools correlated with declining serostatus with p-p > pd/NTpos > p-d/NTneg (Table 2, Figure 2b). Importantly, we found that of the 9 individuals that
had lost binding antibodies partially and neutralizing antibodies completely (p-d/NTneg), 5 still
had a detectable T cell response, thus those individuals could potentially still have some T cellmediated immune protection. Of the four individuals in the p-n group that had lost all
antibodies in the commercial assays, 3 still retained neutralizing antibodies, two of which hat
detectable T cell responses and only one individual had lost all binding and neutralizing
antibodies and also showed no T cell responses (Table 2).
Virus transmission in Ischgl
Between Ischgl 1 and 2, 4 individuals seroconverted, of which one individual had been tested
positive by PCR in October 2020. Two of the remaining 3 reported symptoms compatible with
COVID-19 between the two studies (Supplementary Table 4).
We then investigated whether the high level of immunity in Ischgl, which was still detected in
November, had limited virus transmission during the second wave of SARS-CoV-2, which hit
Austria in autumn 2020. We compared daily numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive
cases of Ischgl with 13 control municipalities selected from Tyrol. Figure 3a shows the 7-day
moving average of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for Ischgl and
the control municipalities. Three things stick out: First, the figure confirms that Ischgl was
severely hit during the first wave of the pandemic, with the daily number of cases being an
order of magnitude larger compared to the control municipalities. Second, during the summer
in both Ischgl and the control municipalities the number of cases converged to (almost) zero,
as in most places in Europe. Third, with the start of the second wave in October 2020, the
trend between the two groups sharply diverged, with the control municipalities showing a
substantially larger number of confirmed cases (Figure 3a).
Figure 3b reports the results of our event study. The plotted coefficients display the weekly
difference in the 7-day moving average of new cases between Ischgl and the control
municipalities relative to the reference period. It shows that at the beginning of September,
the difference between the two groups of municipalities was basically zero. By the end of
October, the number of new cases in the control municipalities started to significantly increase
relative to Ischgl. We continued to find statistically different coefficients up until Christmas,
the end of our observation period (Figure 3b). This difference supports the hypothesis that
the high seroprevalence level of about 40-45% found in Ischgl in November, limited viral
transmission.

Discussion
We studied immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the ski-resort Ischgl, one of the hotspots during the
first wave of the pandemic in March, 2020. We performed antibody testing of a large share of
the Ischgl population in April 2020 and again 6.5 months later, in November 2020. Longitudinal
data allowed us to track the level of antibodies for 801 participants (63.6% of the baseline
adult study population) over time. We show, that antibody levels declined within the first 7-8
months after infection, but that the binding capacity of antibodies increased and antibodies
and/or T cell responses were still detectable in all but one individual.
Our general observation is typical for viral infections, where within a few weeks after the
infection, antibody levels peak and then slowly decline to a lower level that persists for longer
periods, depending on the virus 14. This has also been shown previously for the infection with
SARS-CoV-2 6. However, the question of how long immunity lasts for SARS-CoV-2 has not been
fully resolved.
Immunity to the human coronaviruses that cause a common cold only lasts for 1 to 2 years
and repeated infections with the same virus are common. However, as also suspected to occur
for SARS-CoV-2, reinfection with human coronaviruses may also be the result of viral immune
escape 15. However, SARS-CoV-2 causes a more severe, systemic infection, where immunity
may last longer. Several authors have detected antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for several months
after infection 16. This notion is supported by other studies reporting that immune response
to SARS-CoV-1 (an infection associated with severe illness) remains detectable for longer than
17 years 17,18.
Several newer publications have found, similar to our study, but for a shorter average
observation period, that immunity as defined by T cell and/or neutralizing antibody response
lasts for up to several months and that T cell and antibody responses can be discordant 8,19. A
more recent study, that has analyzed the T and B cell responses in great detail and in some
patients for up to 8 months, but on average for a shorter period, concluded that immune
memory is indeed preserved, in accordance with our findings 7.
The majority of the 412 adults that were seropositive during the Ischgl 1 study in late April
and analyzed again in early November, Ischgl 2, had been infected already in March during
the first wave. Thus, this study, to our knowledge, represents one of the longest and largest
follow-up studies published so far. The conclusion that immunity may last for at least up to 8
months is in accordance with the fact that reinfections worldwide are still rare, although
increasingly reported in the literature 1-3,20,21. However, none have been observed in Ischgl.
Furthermore, this study, in contrast to similar studies, was performed in a population in a
defined area and the transmission within this population could be observed in parallel with
the study of immunity in the laboratory. We found that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in Ischgl
was significantly lower than in comparable municipalities during the second wave that hit
Austria in November. We had already argued in our first study, that with a seroprevalence of
40-45% and in the presence of mild non-pharmacological interventions, Ischgl may have been
near the herd immunity threshold, as the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections had declined
drastically in April. This is in accordance with a second mathematical modelling study showing
that herd immunity can be achieved at a lower rate depending on population heterogeneity

and social activity 22. However, also in other parts of Austria, the incidence declined in April,
which made it difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, when the second wave hit Austria
8 months later, the reduced incidence in Ischgl relative to comparable municipalities (as well
as to the rest of Austria) strongly indicates that indeed the level of immunity to SARS-CoV-2
helped to curb new infections in Ischgl. Given the fact that there was a high level of
seroprevalence still present among the population of Ischgl in November, the ‘lock-down light’
measures were sufficient to effectively suppress local virus transmission, which was not the
case in the rest of Austria (https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/austria-toenter-partial-november-lockdown/). In this respect it is important to note that nonpharmacological interventions (NPI) have been identical for Ischgl and the control
municipalities since April.
Our findings suggest that seropositivity levels of around 40-45% might suffice to stop the virus
when some social distancing and NPIs are in place. Now that vaccines start to roll-out in
Europe, the case of Ischgl indicates that virus transmission can be successfully controlled if
social distancing measures are continued, at levels of vaccine coverage below the predicted
70 to 80% herd immunity threshold.
