Abstract
Background
Since the emergence of COVID-19, the world has been desperate to find effective
therapeutics and vaccinations to treat hundreds of thousands of affected patients and to
suppress the spread of this global pandemic. Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/RTV) is an HIV
antiviral combination that has been considered for treatment of this disease.
Aim of the study
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of
lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in the extant published research. A systematic
review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA statement.
Published English and non-English articles written since December 1, 2019 were selected
for review from 8 electronic databases.
Readily accessible full articles (cohort studies and clinical trials) which specifically
mentioned lopinavir/ritonavir and patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or
COVOID-19 of any age were included. Three researchers separately evaluated the bias in
the reported articles. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis with the
objective of evaluation of the safety and efficacy of LPV/RTV alone or in combination
with other drugs with regard to time to becoming PCR negative, time to body
temperature normalization and cough relief, radiological progression, and safety. Review
Manager (RevMan) was used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest
plots. Meta-analyses were performed using the Mantel Hazel method or the inverse
variance method for dichotomous data and continuous data respectively.
Results
Non-duplicate articles (n=76) were evaluated for possible inclusion. A consensus was
reached to select 29 articles for full-text screening, only 11 articles comprised 1,192
patients were included in this study, and six of which were included for meta-analysis.
In terms of virological cure (PCR negative), three studies reported less time in days to
achieve a virological cure for LPV/RTV arm relative to no antiviral therapy
(conventional) (mean difference = −0.81 day; 95% CI, −4.44 to 2.81; P = 0.007, I2 =
80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (P = 0.66). When comparing
LPV/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm,
but not statically significant (mean difference = 0.95 day; 95% CI, −1.11 to 3.01; P =
0.09, I2 = 58%).
In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief (clinical cure), two studies
reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of LPV/RTV (n
= 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.78; (P =
0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69).
In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia/lung damage,
treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir resulted in no significant decrease in the radiological
progression (OR = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.54; P = 0.59, I2 = 81%), In terms of safety, a
greater number of adverse events were reported for lopinavir/ritonavir (n=45) relative to

the umifenovir arm (n=14) and conventional treatments (n=10 ), P = 0.004, 0,0007,
respectively

Conclusions
The small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study
did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in
COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. This result might not
reflect the actual evidence.

Introduction

Since the emergence of an unknown viral infection in China in December 2019 and
following the identification of this infection as 2019-new coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV,
also known as COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) [1], the world is desperate to find effective therapeutics and vaccinations
to treat hundred thousand of affected patients and to reduce the spread of this global
pandemic [2].
As June 2, there are 1104 registered clinical trials of COVID-19 therapeutics or
vaccinations worldwide that either ongoing or recruiting patients; however, no drug or
vaccine has officially been approved for COVID-19 [2, 3]. These trials have produced
mixed and conflicting results of positive or negative outcomes and inclusive evidence of
efficacy or safety, that render the suspension of some trials inevitable, as in the
hydroxychloroquine trials, which was suggested by World Health Organization (WHO) in
light of safety concerns [4]. This decision was reversed on June 3, 2020 [5] following a
retraction of the research article by Lancet as certain authors were not granted access to the
underlying data [6].
Lopinavir-ritonavir is a protease inhibitor and nucleoside analogue combination used for
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and is also considered a potential treatment for
COVID-19 [7], as its therapeutic value in the treatment of COVID-19 emerged from invitro studies that demonstrated inhibition of several viral corona respiratory illnesses,

including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) [8. 9, 10].
Lopinavir (LPV) is an aspartic acid protease inhibitor of HIV, where inhibition of proteases
enzymes is essential for the intervening of the viral infectious cycle, and is co‐formulated
with ritonavir to boost the pharmacokinetic activity and half‐life of lopinavir through
inhibition of Cytochromes P450, providing adequate suppression of viral load and constant
improvements in CD4+ cell counts, as demonstrated in randomized trials in naïve and
experienced adults and children HIV patients [7].
Lopinavir/ritonavir is available as a single‐tablet formulation (Kaletra®) in dosage
strengths of 400/100 mg or 200/100 mg, and in clinical trials, this combination reduced
rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or death compared to supportive care
or ribavirin alone in a matched cohort group during the early phase of viral acquisition [8].
Lopinavir-ritonavir is being examined in several international clinical trials, including the
RECOVERY trial and SOLIDARITY WHO trial [11], but did not gain authorization to be
used emergently in the current pandemic in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), which has approved only three pharmacologically different therapeutics for
treatments of COVID-19, including antibiotic-hydroxychloroquine, immunotherapyconvalescent plasma therapy, and antiviral-remdesivir [2, 11].
Among the clinical trials that did not find positive results for lopinavir-ritonavir, a study
conducted by Bin Cao et al. and published in New England Journal of Medicine [12]
revealed that treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with clinical

improvement beyond standard care or reduction in mortality rate at 28 days in hospitalized
adult patients with severe COVID-19 [12].
To date, lopinavir/ritonavir combination is available in most countries’ therapeutics
guidelines including USA [13], Saudi Arabia [14], and Ireland [15], which means that the
medicine has tenable evidence of efficacy; however, considering early negative and
conflicting results have emerged [12], there is a need to assess the efficacy and safety of
this COVID-19 treatment in a systematic manner.
Aim of the study
This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the efficacy and safety of
lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients in published research.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted with reference to the basics of Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (16), described as stated by the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement [17, 18].
Search strategy and selection criteria
A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA-P and the PRISMA
statement. Published articles from December 1, 2019 to May 22, 2020 were selected for
review from 8 electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, medRxiv, Proquest,
Wiley online library, Medline, and Nature).

trials were included.
Participants: Patients with lab-confirmed COVOID-19 of any age were included.
Intervention
The interventions were lopinavir/ritonavir versus a control of either no antiviral therapy
(conventional therapy), standard therapy, or lopinavir/ritonavir with other antiviral agents.
Objectives
A. Virological cure on day 7 after initiation of therapy (+ve to -ve PCR: non-detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab).
B. Clinical cure (time to body temperature normalization and time to cough relief).
C. Radiological progression during drug treatment.
D. Safety and tolerability of lopinavir/ritonavir.
Comparisons
A. lopinavir/ritonavir vs no antiviral therapy (conventional therapy)/control.
B. lopinavir/ritonavir in combination of other agents versus conventional therapy/control.

Searching keywords
The search keywords included 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus, COVID-19,
coronavirus disease 2019, SARS-COV-2, lopinavir, ritonavir, combination, kaletra,
treatment, efficacy, clinical trial, cohort, retrospective, and prospective.
Exclusion criteria
Types of articles that were excluded included duplicate articles, editorials, reviews, case
reports, and letters to editors.
Any research articles that did not include data on lopinavir/ritonavir use, did not include
control patients’ group, or reported combined use of lopinavir/ritonavir with other antiviral
medications were also excluded.
Data extraction and analysis
Two reviewers (MT and SA) independently screened the titles with abstracts using the
selection criteria. For relevant articles, full texts were obtained for further evaluation.
Disagreements between the two reviewers after full text screening were reconciled via
consensus by a third reviewer (AA) [19].
Inclusions and exclusions were recorded following PRISMA guidelines presented in the
form of a PRISMA flow diagram and detailed reasons recorded for exclusion. Articles were
categorized as clinical trials or cohort studies. The following data were extracted from
selected studies: authors; publication year; study location; study design and setting; sample
size, age, and gender; details of study intervention and control therapies in addition to data

on adverse events and treatment outcomes; assessment of study risk of bias; and remarks
on noticeable findings.
Risk of biased evaluation of included studies
The quality assessment of the studies was undertaken based on the revised Cochrane
risk of bias tool (RoB 2.0) for randomized controlled studies [20]. ROBINS-I tool was used
to asses non-randomized interventional studies [21], and Newcastle Ottawa Scale for
observational cohort studies [22]. Critical appraisal checklists appropriate to each study
design were applied and checked by the third-team member.
Three investigators (MT, SA, and AA) separately evaluated the possibility of bias using
these tools. Publication bias was not evaluated by funnel plot as there was only three studies
which were included in the meta-analysis part of the study.

Assessment of heterogeneity
Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the χ2 test and I2 statistics (17, 18). An I2
value of 0 to <40% was not considered as significant, 30% to 60% was regarded as
moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% was considered substantial heterogeneity, and 75%
to 100% was considered significant heterogeneity.
Statistical analysis
Because all of the data were continuous and dichotomous data, we used either odds ratio
(OR) or mean difference for estimating the point estimate, along with a 95% confidence
interval (CI). In the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity, we performed the metaanalysis using the Mantel Hazel method or inverse variance method for dichotomous

data and continuous data respectively. Employing a conservative approach, a random
effects model was used, which produces wider CIs than a fixed effect model [16].
Review Manager (Version 5.3, Oxford, UK; The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) was
used to conduct all statistical analyses and generate the forest plots [18].

Results
A total of 8 literature databases were screened and 76 non-duplicate articles was
identified, which were evaluated for possible inclusion using titles and abstracts. Out of
these, 29 articles were selected for full-text screening and finally, eleven articles (total
participants= 1,192) were included in the systematic review and six articles were
included in the meta-analysis. 18 articles were excluded following full-text screening

Comparison 2: Efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir along in combination with
other agents versus no antiviral therapy (conventional therapy) or control
A total of four studies evaluated efficacy of LPV/RTV plus interferon (IFN) [29-32] and
three studies [29-31] evaluated the safety of the combination. Other studies evaluated the
efficacy of LPV/RTV plus standard care [12], ribavirin [30], or umifenovir [31], and
evaluated safety of these combinations.
In terms of the efficacy of the combination in patients with COVID-19, LPV/RTV plus
IFN combination in addition to ribavirin was safe and superior to LPV/RTV alone by
shortening median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7
days [IQR 5–11]) compared to the LPV/RTV arm (12 days [8–15]; hazard ratio 4·37
[95% CI 1·86–10·24], p=0·001) (30). Additionally, combination treatment with
LPV/RTV plus IFN and umifenovir had a more evident therapeutic effect in a shorter
time by normalizing body temperature (4.8±1.94 days vs. 7.3±1.53 days, p=0.03) and
turning PCRs to negative (7.8±3.09 days vs. 12.0±0.82 days, p=0.02) compared to the
umifenovir plus IFN arm with no evident toxic and side effects [31]. However, the use of
LPV/RTV plus IFN combination resulted in less therapeutic responses on COVID-19 in
terms of viral clearance [median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5–9) d versus 11 (8–13)
d, p<0.001) and chest CT changes (91.43% vs 62.22%), p=0.004] compared to the
favipiravir plus IFN combination. Favipiravir arm patients had less adverse events (AEs)
compared to the LPV/RTV arm (11.43% vs 55.56%) (p<0.001) (29). Additionally, no
significant difference on average PCR negative conversion times among IFN plus
LPV/RTV or IFN plus LPV/RTV plus ribavirin treatment arms [32].

The combination of LPV/RTV, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone
exhibited no difference in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical
improvement, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.80) with a similar 28-day mortality (19.2% vs.
25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7).

Discussion

This systematic review included 11 articles relating to the efficacy and safety of
lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 patients, with a total of 1,192 patients included, and only
six articles that comprised 594 patients had findings on the efficacy and safety of
lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment of COVID-19 verses control/conventional therapy were
deemed legible for quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) [23-28].
In terms of virological cure, three studies reported less time in days for LPV/RTV arm (n
= 171) compared with no antiviral therapy (conventional) (n= 117); however, the overall
effect was not significant (mean difference = −0.81 day; 95% CI, −4.44 to 2.81; P =
0.66), similarly the virological cure for lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n = 127) versus the
umifenovir arm (n = 87) (P = 0.37), or lopinavir/ritonavir versus umifenovir plus
lopinavir/ritonavir (P = 0.31) [23-28].
Two studies reported on time to temperature normalization with no significant effect of
LPV/RTV (n = 93) versus umifenovir (n = 71) arm), (OR = 0.87 day; 95% CI, 0.42 to
1.78; (P = 0.70), I2 = 0%), or alleviation of cough duration (p = 0.69) [23, 28]. The total
number of cough days was found to be lower in the LPV/RTV arm compared with the
umifenovir arm or no antiviral therapy (conventional) arm after 7 days of treatment;
however, the overall effect was found to be not significant [23,28].

Interestingly in this study, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 93) versus umifenovir
plus lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 75) arm did not reveal any significant mean difference
between the two arms in terms of virological cure at day seven. In contrast, a favorable
therapeutic effect for umifenovir was observed in a small cohort study when the drug was
combined with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in sixteen COVID-19 patients rather than
lopinavir/ritonavir alone (n=17) [33].
In another study that involved 81 COVID-19 patients, the umifenovir treatment group
had a longer hospital stay than patients in the control group (13 days (IQR 9–17) vs
11 days (IQR 9–14), p 0.04) [34].
Of note, umifenovir, which is branded as Arbidol®, has a wide antiviral activity against
RNA and DNA viruses, and is licensed in Russia and China for treatment and
prophylaxis of influenza, is recommended for treatment of MERS-CoV, was investigated
in SARS-CoV, and is currently being trialed in COVID-19 patients [35].
In terms of CT evidence of radiological progression of pneumonia/lung damage of
lopinavir/ritonavir arm versus umifenovir, although a fewer number of patients exhibited
radiological progression in the LPV/RTV arm compared with the umifenovir arm or no
antiviral therapy (conventional) arm after 7 days of treatment, this effect was not
significant (P = 0.59). Similarly, with lopinavir/ritonavir (n=71) versus no antiviral
therapy [23, 28].
In terms of safety, this study found greater adverse events reported in lopinavir/ritonavir
arm versus no antiviral treatment (conventional) or umifenovir respectively.
Adverse events associated with lopinavir–ritonavir alone or in combination with other
medicines were reported in COVID-19 patients, and were typically gastrointestinal (GIT)

in nature, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [28]; however, serious GIT ADRs
such as acute gastritis and GIT bleeding and acute kidney injury (n=3) were also reported
(28). It was reported that most ADRs associated with lopinavir–ritonavir in combined
groups of medicines are resolved within three days of drug initiation [29].

To address the efficacy and safety of LPV/RTV combined with other drugs in patients with
COVID-9, LPV/RTV plus IFN combination in addition to ribavirin was found superior and
more safe than LPV/RTV alone by shortening time to negative nasopharyngeal swab
compared to the LPV/RTV arm alone [30]. Additionally, a combined treatment regimen of
LPV/RTV plus IFN and umifenovir resulted in a shorter time by normalizing body
temperature and turning PCRs to negative compared to the umifenovir plus IFN arm with
reasonable safety profile [31]. However, the use of LPV/RTV plus IFN combination
resulted in less therapeutic responses on COVID-19 in terms of viral clearance and chest
CT changes compared to the favipiravir plus IFN combination. Favipiravir arm patients
had less AEs compared to the LPV/RTV arm [29]. Additionally, there was no significant
difference in average PCR negative conversion times among IFN plus LPV/RTV or IFN
plus LPV/RTV plus ribavirin treatment arms [32]. The combination of LPV/RTV, in
addition to standard care, or standard care alone revealed no difference in the time to
clinical improvement with a similar 28-day mortality. Gastrointestinal AEs were more
common in the LPV/RTV arm, but serious AEs were more common in the standard care
arm and treatment was stopped early in 13.8% of patients because of AEs [12].
In a recent systematic review (preprint version) that included 69 studies which included
therapeutics for COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir was found to be the third therapeutic
associated with positive outcomes (54.9%) with less negative outcomes (12.3%) compared

to systemic corticosteroids (21.3%), remdesivir (16.9%), moxioxacin (13.4%) and
oseltamivir (12.5%) [36]; however, further controlled studies are needed to draw a valid
conclusion.

The key limitations of this study were the limited number of clinical studies investigating
the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir combination with the limited number of
participants. Another limitation is inability to perform any type of meta-analysis
specifically for the results of efficacy and safety of using lopinavir/ritonavir in combination
with other agents versus no antiviral therapy (conventional therapy) or control because of
the large methodological differences. Despite these limitations, this systematic review
provided valuable insight into the efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes of
lopinavir/ritonavir alone or with other antiviral medications.

Conclusions
The small number of studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis study
did not reveal any statistically significant advantage in efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir in
COVID-19 patients, over conventional or other antiviral treatments. In terms of safety,
this study found greater number of adverse events reported in lopinavir/ritonavir arm
versus no antiviral treatment (conventional) or umifenovir arms respectively.
There is a general understanding of the need to conduct large randomized clinical trials to
determine the efficacy and safety of lopinavir-ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19.
Ideally, these studies should be double-blinded and conducted in a range of settings.
