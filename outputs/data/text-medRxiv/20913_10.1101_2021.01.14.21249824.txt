Key points
Question: We aimed to implement a fully remote seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV2, leveraging electronic methods and at-home self-collection of specimens to engage a
representative study population.
Findings: The population enrolled reflected the ethnic and racial composition of
Massachusetts, revealing a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 3.15% and higher risk of
previous infection associated with healthcare workers/their cohabitants, those with
comorbidities, lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in age groups 18-29
and 50-59 years old.
Meaning: High engagement and positive feedback from participants as well as quality
of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design for future populationlevel serological studies.

Abstract
In the midst of a pandemic, serologic studies are a valuable tool to understand the
course of the outbreak and guide public health and general pandemic management.
However, given significant safety constraints including social distancing and stay-athome orders, sample collection becomes more difficult given traditional phlebotomy
protocols. For such studies, a representative sample of the underlying population is
paramount to elicit meaningful insights that capture the spread of the infection,
particularly when different sub-populations face varying disease burden. We aimed to
address these challenges by conducting a fully remote study to investigate the
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Massachusetts. Leveraging electronic

study engagement and at-home self-collection of finger-prick samples, we enrolled
2,066 participants representative of the ethnic and racial composition of Massachusetts.
SARS-CoV-2 total IgG seropositivity was 3.15%, and follow-up measurements at days
7, 15, 45, and 90 indicate a generally durable antibody response. A higher risk of
infection was observed for healthcare workers and their cohabitants and those with
comorbidities, as well as lower-income, less educated, Hispanic, and those in the age
groups of 18-29 and 50- 59-years-old. High engagement and positive feedback from the
participants and quality of self-collected specimens point to the usefulness of this design
for future population-level serological studies that more effectively and safely reach a
broad representative cohort, thus yielding more comprehensive insights into the burden
of infection and disease in populations.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had far-reaching consequences
since its emergence in Wuhan, China, in December 20191. As of mid-November, there
have been over 55 million cases and 1.34 million deaths worldwide. The more subtle
cost exacted upon society has been evident in the rise of virtual school, remote work,
severe job loss, and economic contraction2.

Coronaviruses (Coronaviridae) are a family of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded
RNA viruses with 39 species that infect vertebrates and have been responsible for
causing three major epidemics over the past two decades through zoonotic spillover3—
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV, Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 caused by MERS-CoV, and now COVID-19
caused by SARS-CoV-24. These three viruses belong to the genus Betacoronavirus,

which also includes the common cold-causing OC43 and HKU1 viruses. The bindingmediating spike proteins of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 share 76% homology at the amino
acid level with 74% sequence identity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) with a
shared mechanism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the host cell
receptor target for infection, confirmed by crystal structures5.

Testing and contact tracing both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals is
essential to characterize infection dynamics and control the spread of the current
COVID-19 pandemic6, 7. Currently, reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction
tests (RT-PCR) form the bedrock of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the United States, detecting
copies of viral RNA in an infected patient. This strategy, however, has been limited by
supply chain breakdowns, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical
supplies8, testing backlogs, reliance on trained personnel9, and false positives from
significantly amplified but non-infectious viral loads10. Alternatively, the measurement of
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood is relatively cheap, and serology has been
proposed as an alternative method to identify individuals who have previously had
symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and recovered11.

Studies surrounding the humoral response mounted against SARS-CoV-2 infection
continue to emerge as the pandemic persists12, 13, 14. Current research demonstrates
seroconversion for IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies over the course of infection, but it is still
unclear how long-lived and functional (e.g. potently neutralizing) these responses are
after the primary infection. Although our understanding of the clinical significance of

seropositivity is still limited, well designed population sero-surveys can be powerful tools
to help determine the stage of the outbreak and trend of disease15. Such studies will
also provide a better understanding of the dynamics of antibody responses for
differentiation of individuals with acquired immunity from those who remain susceptible
to infection and disease, therefore helping to determine how to safely reopen the
economy, where to deploy resources for disease prevention and management, and will
help identify emerging outbreaks early16.

In order to facilitate the use of serology as a public health tool, we designed and
implemented a fully remote mechanism for conducting large-scale sero-surveys. We
coupled the use of electronic medium for study engagement and successful recruitment
and retention of representative cohorts with at-home self-collection of serological
specimens, allowing for greater participant safety and increased sampling of diverse
populations with reduced cost. Using these logistics, we successfully conducted a
cross-sectional survey of the population of Massachusetts, measuring the prevalence of
total IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals using
simple at-home finger prick samples. Findings may be used to inform evolving health
policy in response to the pandemic and provide a proof-of-concept for the logistics of
future sero-epidemiological studies.

This at-home, decentralized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study targeted adult (≥
18 years of age) residents of Massachusetts, with no requirements around prior or
expected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. With the goal of enrolling approximately 2,000
volunteers, potential participants were identified through partnerships with for- and nonprofit entities and digital ad campaigns and referrals, and they received a link to a
landing page to learn more about the study and enroll if interested. Participants were
required to have reliable Internet access. Although not included as a formal exclusion
criterion, participants were also required to speak English, as the study was not offered
in additional languages. If eligible, based on electronic screening, participants
electronically reviewed the informed consent form and completed a background
questionnaire (Supplementary Table 1) with questions related to demographic profile
(including sex, age, race, ethnicity, region of residency, education, income range,
housing status, pregnancy and recent medical history/comorbid conditions), and
COVID-19 history (including presumptive and confirmed SARS-CoV-2, checklist of
symptoms and their duration, level of care received and clinical outcome). Sociobehavioral questions related to perception of COVID-19 risk (such as adherence to
social distancing guidelines, use of masks/face coverings in public and type of
transportation used) were also included. Volunteers were not compensated for their
participation in the study, and there were no requirements regarding prior or expected
exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Specimen collection

After completing the baseline questionnaire, participants were shipped through the
United States Postal Service (USPS) an at-home specimen collection kit which included
two spring-loaded lancets, a biohazard bag, and instructions for self-administered
finger-prick blood collection. Participants were asked to place approximately 10-20
drops of blood on to the supplied Whatman 903 dried blood spot protein saver filter
paper. After air drying the specimen, the participants were instructed to place the filter
paper into sealed, pre-paid envelopes provided in the kit and mail it to the central
laboratory, Molecular Testing Labs, a CLIA-licensed and CAP-accredited laboratory, for
analysis. All participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG result were asked to provide
additional blood finger-prick samples at day 7, 15, 45, and 90 after receiving the initial
result (Figure 1a and b). Throughout the study, all participants had access to frequently
asked questions (FAQ) as well as a dedicated support team online or by phone to
discuss questions about specimen collection or other elements of the study.

Laboratory tests
The presence of total IgG antibodies against the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 was
measured using the FDA EUA-approved EUROIMMUN ELISA assay as previously
described17. Test results were returned to the participants by Molecular Testing Labs
within 24-72 hours of receipt of the specimen using the study mobile application
platform as positive, negative, or indeterminate. A second kit was offered to any
participant who received an indeterminate result and wished to provide another
specimen.

Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests and univariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the
association between demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and seroprevalence
of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All analyses were performed using Python (version
3.8.5).

Ethics approval
Ethical clearance was obtained from Advarra (Pro00043729) and the Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health review board (IRB20-1511). Written informed consent
was obtained electronically from all participants prior to enrollment in this study.

Results
Study Enrollment and Participant Demographics
690 of the planned 2,000 participants were enrolled between June 16 and June 30,
2020 using convenience sampling (Figure 1a) through partnerships leading to employee
and symptom-tracking app referral (Figure 1b). Most of this initial population was
comprised of Caucasian, high-income (>$140,000) individuals (Table 1). In order to
increase diversity and mirror race and ethnicity proportions of 2019 Massachusetts
census data and achieve a 50/50 split between residency within rural or urban centers
(as defined by the Massachusetts State Office of Rural Health), age, zip code, internet
access, race and ethnicity information were used to pre-screen interested individuals
and temporarily place them on a waiting list/lottery, allowing for the random selection of
individuals to fulfill the cohort population profile. The remaining participants (n=1,376)

were enrolled between July 29 and August 24, 2020. In total, 48.3% (n=939) of
participants for whom recruitment data was available (n=1,945) were recruited through
online ads, specifically Facebook (Figure 1b).

From an initial cohort of 2,066 study participants, 90.61% (n=1872) of individuals mailed
their sample to the laboratory for analysis (Figure 1a). Only data from individuals who
completed sample collection and return was included in the analysis. The median age of
study enrollees was 40 years old (interquartile range [IQR] 32 to 52 years old), 73.95%
(n=1368) were female, while 81.37% (n=1681) hold an undergraduate degree or higher
(Table 1). The cohort was generally distributed over the state of Massachusetts
(Supplementary Figure 1), with 48.65% and 51.35% from rural and urban areas,
respectively. A small proportion of the 59 participants who tested positive (8.47%, n=5)
cohabitated with other individuals in the study, and 13.24% of participants (n=245) were
either healthcare workers or shared a household with one. A total of 40.11% (n=742)
reported having symptoms resembling those of COVID-19 since January 2020
(including cough, fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, and new loss of smell or taste)
(Figure 3c), and 14.09% (n=291) reported having one or more comorbid health
conditions known to increase risk of COVID-19 (e.g., diabetes, asthma, being
immunocompromised, heart or lung disease) (Table 1).

SARS-CoV-2 serology in Massachusetts
3.15% (n=59) of the individuals who returned their samples were seropositive for total
IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (Figure 2a) and were requested to send

follow-up samples at days 7, 14, 45, and 90 after initial positive result (Figure 2b).
31.25% (n=10 of 32) of these baseline seropositive participants for whom data is
currently available, with follow-up ongoing, remained positive during the entire 90-day
follow-up period, with 1 seemingly false positive at baseline and 5 indeterminate cases
(Figure 2b).

Risk of SARS-CoV-2 in Massachusetts
Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and log odds scores (with base e) were used to assess
the effect of different demographic or self-reported variables on seropositivity as an
indication for past infection (Table 2). In this cohort, the individuals in the youngest age
group (18-29 years old) and those 50-59 years old were at the highest risk of infection
(log odds=0.137 and 0.805 respectively, p=0.0157). Hispanics had higher risk
compared to non-Hispanic individuals (log odds=0.825, vs. log odds= -0.825,
p=0.0173). Individuals with some or no high school were also shown to be at higher risk
compared to any other educational level (log odds=3.155, p=0.000014), as well as
those in the lowest income bracket, less than $20,000 in annual income (log
odds=1.137, p=0.0252), and those who presented with any symptoms (log odds=1.137,
p=0.252). Individuals sharing a household with others were generally at higher risk than
those living alone (log odds= -0.25 to 0.23, p<0.001), although there were very small
sample size effects in this analysis, rendering such conclusions extremely limited (Table
2).
There was no significant difference between those living in rural or urban areas, those
who were or share a house with a healthcare worker, or between those with or without

comorbidities, although the low number of participants in some of these groups may
have precluded our analysis (Table 2). Of note, mask wearing and social distancing
were not included in our analysis because of the general uniformity of this self-reported
data across the study population; all but one person reported wearing a mask always or
sometimes when outside of their household; the same held for all but six people with
social distancing.

Participant Feedback
After sample collection and testing were finalized, 1,764 participants were sent a survey
to provide feedback about the study process, eliciting a 31% (n=547) overall response
rate. Survey respondents were generally representative of the study population
(Supplementary Figure 2). 96.16% (n=526) of them reported being extremely satisfied
or satisfied with the process of enrolling in the study (Figure 3a), 84.68% (n=459)
reported being extremely satisfied or satisfied with the experience of self-collection of
the finger-prick sample (Figure 3b), with the majority of responses indicating sample
collection was very to extremely easy (Figure 3d). More respondents rated the
experience as more comfortable than not (Figure 3e). Meanwhile, 95.37% (n=515) were
extremely satisfied or satisfied with the content and quality of study communications
(Figure 3c). With respect to the potential for future studies, 56.67% (n=306) of
respondents said they were extremely likely to recommend this method of remote
enrollment, at-home self-collection of specimens and antibody testing to others (Figure
3f). 72.23% (n=385) of the responders were willing to self-perform finger-prick blood
collection up to once per week if needed (Figure 3g). While 63.65% (n=345) of the

respondents did not have children, 19.37% (n=105) of those who did indicated that they
would enroll their child in such a study.

Discussion
The risk of viral transmission and limited capacity of healthcare systems called for the
decentralized, at-home nature of this SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study, leveraging
online recruitment, eConsent, electronic questionnaires, and direct-to-patient shipping to
reach a broad representative study population. This study was a valuable opportunity to
utilize and assess an at-home approach, and participant survey data reveals it was
overwhelmingly well-received and indicates a strong likelihood of success for future
deployment of larger studies of this modality. Although the discomfort of the finger-prick
was the biggest concern expressed by participants, self-collection of samples was
reported to be easy and generated samples of quality without the need for trained
professionals or PPE, providing a remedy for the difficulties often encountered when
obtaining standard specimens by phlebotomy, particularly during a pandemic.
While representative cohorts are especially important for COVID-19 prevalence
estimation because of the disproportionate impact of that this pandemic has exacted
upon racial and ethnic minorities18, minimally biased data regarding the status of the
pandemic has been significantly limited thus far19, 20, 21. Convenience sampling can
skew data by drawing a study cohort that is not representative of the underlying
population, as such surveys may not be able to adequately reach less advantaged
communities, whether in rural areas or in lower-income urban settings. Furthermore,

individuals seeking or willing to receive testing may be more likely to have experienced
illness.
To this end, the recruitment strategy employed in the present study was very successful
in reaching a representation of the population structure seen across Massachusetts in
regard to race, ethnicity, and location of residency. However, recruitment was still
subject to skew towards individuals who were more prolific Facebook users, female,
highly educated, and wealthy (>$140,000 annual income). A small number of
participants were not fully random because of shared households and thus could be
non-independent exposures, possibly skewing any extrapolated seroprevalence
estimates. Travel patterns were not accounted for, which may explain the similar risk
observed among those from rural and urban areas. It is also possible that participants
were generally more attuned to the nature of the pandemic and thus may have been
less likely to have been infected because of greater behavioral and health awareness.
Despite limitations, this study provides valuable data with regards to disease risk trends.
Our data generally points to healthcare workers or those who live with them, those with
comorbidities, and lower-income, less educated, and Latin-American individuals as
those with relatively greater risk for COVID-19 in Massachusetts. Individuals in the age
ranges of 18 to 29 and 50 to 59 years were more likely to have antibodies to SARSCoV-2, which likely reflect behavioral patterns (e.g., less careful social behavior) and
increased transmission among the young and a covarying increased risk of disease by
greater incidence of comorbidities among the older, respectively. For the 59 of 1872
individuals with positive IgG to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, sustained serological

responses are generally observed, with the few negative results at day 90 possibly
serving as an indicator of the natural waning of an antibody response over time22.
Some of the samples may appear as a false negative or a false positive also because
the test sensitivity and specificity, respectively, are predicted to be lower for samples of
lower antibody prevalence17.
The population breakdown in Massachusetts does not accurately reflect the disease
burden for COVID-19 reported in macro-aggregated statistics across the country, and
while it is important to consider the limitations of our data when making claims about
seroprevalence for the state, it also important to recognize the heterogeneity of the
pandemic in the state and nationwide. At the time of this study in early fall of 2020, the
incidence of COVID-19 was relatively low in the state of Massachusetts, and therefore
follow-up studies in more disease-burdened areas and/or with larger sample sizes
would provide the greater power needed to make more definitive assessments about
risk for COVID-19 for specific demographic groups. The overall seroprevalence
observed in this study (3.15%) indicates that the Massachusetts population is nowhere
near close to supposed herd immunity23 and demonstrates the importance of a
continued commitment to fighting the pandemic through controllable nonpharmaceutical interventions currently at our disposal. Future studies would improve
recruitment of such a representative sample by taking into account income and
education levels in conjunction with racial and ethnic data to more accurately represent
complete socioeconomic conditions.
