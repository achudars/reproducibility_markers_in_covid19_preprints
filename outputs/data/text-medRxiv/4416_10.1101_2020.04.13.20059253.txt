Abstract
Background Current geographic spread of documented severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections shows heterogeneity. This study explores the role of age
in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease
severity and mortality across countries.
Methods An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2
transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population ≥1 million.
Results Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be
stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the
population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R0 was 1.05
versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons)
for the infections rate was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3
(versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9).
Conclusions Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide.
Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may
experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with
predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These
predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy
toll nearly everywhere.

INTRODUCTION
The current geographic spread of the documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] infections and associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) [1]
shows heterogeneity [2]. This remains unexplained but may possibly reflect delays in virus
introduction into the population, differentials in testing and/or reporting, differentials in the
implementation, scale, adherence, and timing of public health interventions, or other
epidemiological factors. In this study, we explore the role of age in explaining the differential
spread of the infection and its future epidemic potential.
As our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is rapidly evolving [3], the
role of age in the epidemiology of this infection is becoming increasingly apparent [4-7]. In a
recent study examining SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology in China [4], we quantified the effect of age
on the biological susceptibility to infection acquisition. We found that relative to individuals
aged 60-69 years, susceptibility was 0.06 in those aged 0-19 years, 0.34 in those aged 20-29
years, 0.57 in those aged 30-39 years, 0.69 in those aged 40-49 years, 0.79 in those aged 50-59
years, 0.94 in those aged 70-79 years, and 0.88 in those aged ≥80 years (Supplementary Figure
S1). Notably, this age-dependence was estimated after accounting for the assortativeness in
population mixing by age [4].
Age also affects disease progression [7-10] and mortality risk [11-13] among those infected. The
proportion of infections that eventually progress to severe disease, critical disease, or death,
increases rapidly with age, especially among those ≥50 years of age (Supplementary Figure S2)
[8-12]. Since the demographic structure of the population (that is the distribution of the
population across the different age groups) varies by country and region, this poses a question as

to the extent to which age effects can drive geographic differentials in the reproduction number (
R0 ), epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality.

We aimed here to answer this question and to estimate for each country (with a population ≥1
million), region, and globally, R0 , and the rate per 100 persons (out of the total population by the
end of the epidemic cycle) of each of the cumulative number of incident infections, mild
infections, severe and/or critical disease cases, and deaths, in addition to the number of days
needed for the national epidemic to reach its incidence peak (a measure of how fast the epidemic
will grow). We also aimed to introduce indices for infection severity, mortality, and
susceptibility across countries.
METHODS
We adapted and applied our recently developed deterministic mathematical model [4] describing
SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in China (Supplementary Figure S3), to 159 countries and
territories, virtually covering the world population [14]. Since our focus was on investigating the
natural course of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and on assessing its full epidemic potential, the
model was applied assuming the worst-case scenario for the epidemic in each country, that is in
absence of any intervention.
The model stratified the population into compartments according to age (0-9, 10-19, …, ≥80
years), infection status (uninfected, infected), infection stage (mild, severe, critical), and disease
stage (severe, critical), using a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations
(Supplementary Section 1). Susceptible individuals in each age group were assumed at risk of
acquiring the infection at a hazard rate that varies based on the age-specific susceptibility to the
infection (Supplementary Figure S1), the infectious contact rate per day, and the transmission

mixing matrix between the different age groups (Supplementary Section 1). Following a latency
period of 3.69 days [15-18], infected individuals develop mild, severe, or critical infection, as
informed by the observed age-specific distribution of cases across these infection stages in China
[8-10]. The duration of infectiousness was assumed to last for 3.48 days [8, 15, 17, 18] after
which individuals with mild infection recover, while those with severe and critical infection
develop, respectively, severe and critical disease over a period of 28 days [8] prior to recovery.
Individuals with critical disease have the additional risk of disease mortality, as informed by the
age-stratified disease mortality rate in China [11, 12].
Model parameters were based on current data for SARS-CoV-2 natural history and
epidemiology, or through model fitting to the China outbreak data [4] (Supplementary Section 2
and Table S1). Namely, the overall infectious contact rate, age-specific biological susceptibility
profile, and age-specific mortality rate were assumed as those in China [4]. The population size,
demographic structure, and life expectancy in countries and territories with a population of ≥1
million, as of 2020, were extracted from the United Nations World Population Prospects
database [14]. Model parameters, definitions, values, and justifications are in Supplementary
Section 2 and Tables S1 and S2. Indices for mortality, infection severity, and susceptibility were
derived by weighting each of these factors in each age group by the fraction of the population in
that age group, and then summing the contributions of all ages.
Ranges of uncertainty around model-predicted outcomes were determined using five-hundred
simulation runs that applied Latin Hypercube sampling [19, 20] from a multidimensional
distribution of the model parameters. At each run, input parameter values were selected from
ranges specified by assuming ±30% uncertainty around parameters’ point estimates. The
resulting distribution for each model-predicted outcome was then used to derive the most

performed in MATLAB R2019a [21], while statistical analyses were performed in STATA/SE
16.1 [22].
RESULTS
In what follows, we highlight results for select (mostly populous) countries that are of broad
geographic representation and characterized by diverse demographic structures. These include
Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Italy, Niger, Pakistan, and USA. Detailed results for all
159 countries and territories are in Supplementary Tables S3-S8.
Figure 1A shows the estimated R0 in these select countries, which was highest in Italy at 2.30,
followed by USA and China at 1.95, Brazil at 1.75, Indonesia at 1.55, India at 1.45, Egypt at
1.35, Pakistan at 1.25, and lowest in Niger at 0.93. Country-specific estimates of R0 grouped by
World Health Organization (WHO) region are illustrated in Figure 2. The median R0 was 1.05
(range: 0.93-1.95) in African Region (AFRO), 1.45 (range: 0.98-1.75) in Eastern Mediterranean
Region (EMRO), 1.55 (range: 1.15-1.95) in South-East Asia Region (SEARO), 1.65 (range:
1.25-2.28) in Region of the Americas (AMRO), 1.85 (range: 1.25-2.30) in Western pacific
Region (WPRO), and 2.05 (range: 1.25-2.30) in European Region (EURO). Globally, the median
R0 was 1.55 with a range of 0.93-2.30.

Figure 1B shows the estimated number of days needed for the national epidemic to reach its
incidence peak. In Italy, the peak was reached after 122 days (~4 months), whereas in Pakistan it
was reached after 350 days (nearly a year). Meanwhile, since R0 <1, no epidemic would emerge
in Niger. Of note that the number of days needed for the national epidemic to reach its incidence

peak depends on the population size in addition to R0 — it takes more time for the epidemic to
reach its peak in larger nations (Supplementary Tables S3-S8).
The estimated incidence rate per 100 persons, defined as the cumulative number of infections by
the end of the epidemic cycle out of the total population, was highest in Italy at 75.5 and lowest
in Pakistan at 33.0 (Figure 3A). Across world regions, the median incidence rate per 100 persons
was 22.5 (range: 0.25-63.5) in AFRO, 45.0 (range: 1.5-65.0) in EMRO, 49.0 (range: 25.0-66.5)
in SEARO, 53.0 in AMRO (range: 35.0-70.5), 63.5 (range: 31.0-76.5) in WPRO, and 69.0
(range: 31.0-75.5) in EURO, and 49.0 (range: 0.25-76.5) globally.
The estimated death rate per 100 persons followed the same pattern, where it was highest in Italy
at 4.7 and lowest in Pakistan at 0.9 (Figure 3B). Across world regions, the median death rate per
100 persons was 0.5 (range: 0.0-2.8) in AFRO, 0.9 (range: 0.0-2.0) in EMRO, 1.6 (range: 0.82.9) in SEARO, 2.0 in AMRO (range: 1.0-4.2), 2.7 (range: 0.8-5.3) in WPRO, and 3.9 (range:
0.8-4.7) in EURO, and 1.6 (range: 0.0-5.3) globally.
The estimated rate of mild infections per 100 persons was highest in Italy at 60.5 and lowest in
Pakistan at 27.0 (Figure 4A). Across world regions, the median per 100 persons was 17.0 (range:
0.25-52.5) in AFRO, 39.0 (range: 1.5-55.0) in EMRO, 41.0 (range: 23.0-54.5) in SEARO, 43.5
in AMRO (range: 29.0-56.5), 51.5 (range: 27.0-61.5) in WPRO, and 56.5 (range: 25.0-65.0) in
EURO, and 41.0 (range: 0.25-61.5) globally.
Meanwhile, the estimated rate of severe and/or critical disease cases per 100 persons was highest
in Italy at 14.7 and lowest in Pakistan at 5.0 (Figure 4B). Across world regions, the median per
100 persons was 3.3 (range: 0.0-11.3) in AFRO, 7.1 (range: 0.3-9.5) in EMRO, 7.7 (range: 4.1-

11.9) in SEARO, 8.7 in AMRO (range: 5.0-13.5), 11.5 (range: 5.0-15.5) in WPRO, and 13.0
(range: 4.7-14.7) in EURO, and 8.0 (range: 0.0-15.5) globally.
The indices for mortality, infection severity, and susceptibility varied across countries and
regions (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S4). The medians for the mortality, critical
infections, and susceptibility indices were lowest in AFRO at 0.5%, 2.7%, and 28.2%,
respectively, and highest in EURO at 2.4%, 7.4%, and 53.7%, respectively (Figure 5).
Meanwhile, the medians for mild infections and severe infections indices were lowest in EURO
at 83.1% and 9.6%, respectively and highest in AFRO at 87.2% and 10.2%, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S4).
DISCUSSION
The above results suggest that although this pandemic is a formidable challenge globally, its
intensity and toll in terms of morbidity and mortality may vary substantially by country and
regionally. While some countries, particularly in resource-rich countries, may experience large
and rapid epidemics, other countries, particularly in resource-poor countries, may experience
smaller and slower epidemics. While the scale of the epidemic may be smallest in sub-Saharan
Africa with its young population, it could be intense in countries with small children population
and sizable adult and/or elderly population.
The key finding of this study is the role of age in potentially driving divergent SARS-CoV-2
epidemic trajectories and disease burdens. The effect of age reflects the interplay of three main
factors: the variation in susceptibility by age (Supplementary Figure S1), variation in disease
severity and mortality by age (Supplementary Figure S2), and variation in demographic structure
across countries (Supplementary Tables S3-S8). The combined effect of these factors can result

in stark variations in R0 (Figure 2), and consequently epidemic potential, disease severity, and
disease mortality—there was strong correlation between R0 and median age across countries
(Supplementary Figure S5). Incidentally, the globally diagnosed cases as of April 9th, 2020 show
a correlation with median age across countries (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.71 (95% CI:
0.62-0.78), p<0.001). A linear regression analysis using these data indicated an increase in the
number of diagnosed infections by 1058.0 (95% CI: 386.0-1729.9; p: 0.002) for every one-year
increase in median age. Although this may be explained by most diagnosed infections being
reported by countries with advanced testing infrastructure, this may support the role of age
presented here. Importantly, as infection transmission dynamics is a non-linear phenomenon,
even small changes in R0 , when R0 is in the range of 1-2, can drive considerable differences in
epidemic size and trajectory (Supplementary Figure S6).
An illustration of the role of age can be seen in Niger, a nation with a median age of only 15
years, where the exclusion of children from the population would have increased R0 from 0.93
to 2.6. This demonstrates how the lower susceptibility among younger persons, particularly
children, acts as a “herd immunity” impeding the ferocious strength of the force of infection of
an otherwise very infectious virus. This epidemiological feature contrasts that of other
respiratory infections, such as the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic (H1N1pdm) infection
(Supplementary Figure S7) [23], where the cumulative incidence was found to be highest among
children and young adults, and much smaller among older adults.
One possible inference to be drawn from the above results is that epidemic size and associated
disease burden could be highest in settings with sizable mid-age and/or elderly populations, as
currently exemplified by Italy. This may also possibly explain sub-national patterns, such as the
9

large number of diagnosed cases in the city of New York, although additional fine-grained
analyses are needed to delineate within-country heterogeneities in transmission dynamics.
Another possible inference of relevance to containment efforts relates to the likelihood of the
infection establishing itself in a population. The probability of a major outbreak upon
introduction of one infection is given approximately by 1 − 1 R0 [24, 25]. Accordingly, in
countries where R0 is just above the epidemic threshold of R0 = 1 , the virus will need to be
introduced multiple times before it can generate sustainable chains of transmission
(Supplementary Figure S8 provides an illustration of this effect). In such countries, less
disruptive social distancing measures may be sufficient to contain the epidemic compared to
countries with larger R0 .
Our study explores the potential effect of age on the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but other
factors that remain poorly understood, may also contribute to driving different epidemic
trajectories. Transmission of the virus may be affected by seasonality, environmental and genetic
factors, differences in social network structure and cultural norms (such as shaking hands,
kissing, and other person-to-person contacts), and underlying co-morbidities which also impact
disease severity and mortality. These factors may have contributed to a slowly growing epidemic
in Japan, despite its demographic structure, as opposed to fast growing epidemics in the
European Region and the USA.
This study has limitations. Model estimations are contingent on the validity and generalizability
of input data. Our estimates were based on SARS-CoV-2 natural history and disease progression
data from China, but these may not be applicable to other countries. The key factor driving the
heterogeneity in transmission dynamics is the age-specific biological susceptibility profile. We

used the susceptibility profile as derived from the China outbreak data [4], but this may not be
generalizable to other countries. More estimates from other countries are needed to investigate
the potential variation in this profile. While current data on the attack rate from different
countries supports age heterogeneity and lower exposure among children, different countries
show still variation in the age-stratified attack rate (Supplementary Figures S9 and S10). Of note
that the observed lower susceptibility to the infection at younger age [4] does not necessarily
imply absence of infection, but may reflect rapid infection clearance or subclinical infection.
This may impact our estimates depending on these infections’ degree of infectiousness. A
sensitivity analysis assuming a 50% increase in the susceptibility of younger age cohorts (to
somewhat reflect the effect of subclinical infections) resulted in smaller differences in R0 across
countries, but still supported our findings of wide heterogeneity in R0 (supplementary Figure
S11). It is conceivable that such subclinical infections may have lower viral load, and therefore
rapid infection clearance and limited transmission potential. Data on infection clusters from
China and other countries suggested that children do not appear to play a significant role in the
transmission of this infection [7, 8, 26].
Our study may have overestimated disease mortality by basing mortality rates on estimates of
crude case fatality rate in China, as suggested by a recent study [13]. Our results are based on the
most probable value for R0 as estimated through 500 runs of uncertainty analysis. The latter may
have biased our reported results towards lower R0 . For instance, the most probable value for R0
in China was 1.95, but the point estimate assuming the baseline values of the input parameters
was higher at 2.10 [4]. Despite these limitations, our parsimonious model, tailored to the nature
of available data, was able to reproduce the epidemic as observed in China [4], and generated
results that are valid to a wide range of model assumptions.

CONCLUSION
Age appears to be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries
with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience
large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions, necessitating disruptive social distancing
measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts
may experience smaller and slower epidemics and may require less disruptive social distancing
measures to contain the epidemic. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency,
and should not affect national response in strengthening preparedness plans and in implementing
prevention interventions. Once established, and even if smaller in scale due to their
predominantly younger population, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic would still cause a heavy toll on
developing countries with resource-poor healthcare infrastructure.

1. Mathematical model structure
We applied a recently developed deterministic compartmental mathematical model that describes
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission dynamics and
disease progression in a population [1], to all countries and territories with a population of at
least one million, as of 2020 [7]. An illustration of the basic model structure can be found in
Figure S3. The model stratifies the population into compartments based on age (0-9, 10-19, 2029,…, ≥80 years), infection status (uninfected, infected), infection stage (mild, severe, critical),
and disease stage (severe, critical).
Figure S3: Schematic diagram illustrating the basic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 model.

A system of coupled nonlinear differential equations is used to describe SARS-CoV-2
transmission dynamics. Nine age cohorts were considered ( a = 1, 2,...,9 ) , each representing a
ten-year age band apart from the last cohort which includes individuals aged ≥80 years. The agespecific distribution for each country/territory, as of the year 2020, was obtained from the United
Nations World Population Prospects database [7]. All disease-related mortality was assumed to
occur in individuals that are in the critical disease stage, as informed by the China outbreak data
[5].

aFor each epidemiologic indicator, the table reports the most probable estimate and the 95% uncertainty interval. For a number of countries, R was close to 1 in some of the
0
uncertainty runs leading to an estimated time for peak incidence beyond the simulation duration of two years (delayed epidemic peak). For these countries, the upper limit of the
uncertainty interval was set at 700 days, that is the end day of the simulation. Uncertainty runs in which R0 was less than 1 led to no epidemic emergence, and thus were excluded
from further analysis. Reported ranges for the epidemic indicators did not include these runs, except for the range of R0.
bThe estimated time for peak incidence was beyond the simulation duration of two years. The upper limit of the uncertainty interval was set at 700 days, that is the end day of the
simulation.
cEstimates are for the median (and range).

aFor each epidemiologic indicator, the table reports the most probable estimate and the 95% uncertainty interval. For a number of countries, R was close to 1 in some of the
0
uncertainty runs leading to an estimated time for peak incidence beyond the simulation duration of two years (delayed epidemic peak). For these countries, the upper limit of the
uncertainty interval was set at 700 days, that is the end day of the simulation. Uncertainty runs in which R0 was less than 1 led to no epidemic emergence, and thus were excluded
from further analysis. Reported ranges for the epidemic indicators did not include these runs, except for the range of R0.
cEstimates are for the median (and range).

0
uncertainty runs leading to an estimated time for peak incidence beyond the simulation duration of two years (delayed epidemic peak). For these countries, the upper limit of the
uncertainty interval was set at 700 days, that is the end day of the simulation. Uncertainty runs in which R0 was less than 1 led to no epidemic emergence, and thus were excluded
from further analysis. Reported ranges for the epidemic indicators did not include these runs, except for the range of R0.

from further analysis. Reported ranges for the epidemic indicators did not include these runs, except for the range of R0.
