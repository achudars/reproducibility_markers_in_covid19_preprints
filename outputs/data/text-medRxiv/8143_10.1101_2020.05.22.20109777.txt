A benchmark of online COVID-19 symptom checkers

Abstract
Background
A large number of online COVID-19 symptom checkers and chatbots have been
developed but anecdotal evidence suggests that their conclusions are highly variable.
To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the accuracy of COVID-19 symptom checkers
in a statistically rigorous manner.
Methods
In this paper, we evaluate 10 different COVID-19 symptom checkers screening 50
COVID-19 case reports alongside 410 non-COVID-19 control cases.
Results
We find that the number of correctly assessed cases varies considerably between
different symptom checkers, with Symptoma (F​1​=0.92, MCC=0.85) showing the overall
best performance followed by Infermedica (F​1​=0.80, MCC=0.61).

Introduction
In the modern world, large numbers of patients initially turn to various online sources
for self-diagnoses before seeking diagnoses from a trained medical professional. But
web sources have inherent problems such as misinformation, misunderstandings,
misleading advertisements and varying quality ​[1]​. Interactive examples of web sources
developed to meet the need of online diagnoses are sometimes referred to as symptom

checkers or chatbots ​[2]​[3]​. Based on a list of entered symptoms and other factors,
symptom checkers return a list of potential diseases.
Online symptom checkers have become popular in the context of the novel coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as access to doctors is reduced, worry in the
population is high, and lots of misinformation is circulating the web ​[1]​. On COVID-19
symptom checker web pages users are asked a series of COVID-19 specific questions
and, upon completion, an association between the answers and COVID-19 is given
alongside behavioural recommendations, e.g., self-isolate.
COVID-19 symptom checkers are valuable tools for pre-assessment and screening
during this pandemic, both taking pressure off from clinicians and reducing footfall
within hospitals. A large number of symptom checkers specific to COVID-19 have been
developed. Anecdotal evidence (e.g. a newspaper article ​[4]​) suggests that their
conclusions differ with possible implications on the quality of the symptom assessment.
To our knowledge, there exist no studies comparing and evaluating COVID-19 symptom
checkers.
In the following, we present a study evaluating 10 different COVID-19 online symptom
checkers using 50 COVID-19 cases extracted from the literature and 410 non-COVID-19
control cases of patients with other diseases. We find that the COVID-19 symptom
checkers’ classification of many patient cases differ as well as their accuracies.
Symptoma (F1=0.92, MCC=0.85) shows the overall best performance followed by
Infermedica (F1=0.80, MCC=0.61).

Methods
COVID-19 symptom checkers
Ten COVID-19 symptom checkers that were freely available online between 3rd and 9th
of April 2020 were selected for this study (​Table 1​). These symptom checkers were used
in the versions available in this date range and updates after this date were not
considered for analysis.
As a baseline for the performance evaluation of the 10 online COVID-19 symptom
checkers, we developed two additional simplistic symptom checkers. These two
checkers evaluate and weigh the presence of WHO ​[5]​ provided COVID-19 symptom
frequencies (see ​S1 Table​) based on vector distance (SF-DIST) and cosine similarity
(SF-COS). These approaches can be implemented in a few lines of code (see ​S2 Text​).

Clinical cases
We used a total of 460 clinical cases to evaluate the performance of the COVID-19
symptom checkers. Each case lists both symptoms and the correct diagnosis, alongside
the age and sex of the patient when available. Details of the two case sets used are
given below and in ​Table 2​.
COVID-19 cases
A total of 50 COVID-19 cases were extracted by three trained medical doctors from the
literature and are listed in ​S3 Table​. Each case describes one patient’s medical situation,

i.e. symptoms experienced or COVID-19 contacts. Extreme edge cases of COVID-19 such
as patients with several severe comorbidities were not included in this study.
Control cases
COVID-19 cases allow us to evaluate the sensitivity of symptom checkers. To also
evaluate the specificity, 410 control cases from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) were
sourced ​[6,7]​. To allow a fair assessment, we only used cases containing at least one of
the COVID-19 symptoms (see ​S4 Table​) reported by the WHO ​[5]​. Classifying
non-relevant cases (e.g., a fracture) would overestimate the symptom checkers’
specificity. Furthermore, these patients would not consult an online COVID-19 symptom
checker. None of these 410 BMJ cases has COVID-19 listed as the diagnosis as the cases
where collected before the COVID-19 outbreak.

Accuracy evaluation
For statistical analysis we used the following classification:
●

True-positive (TP): COVID-19 case classified as COVID-19

●

False-positive (FP): non-COVID-19 case classified as COVID-19

●

True-negative (TN): non-COVID-19 case classified as non-COVID-19

●

False-negative (FN): COVID-19 case classified as non-COVID-19

For each symptom checkers, we calculate the following metrics :
Sensitivity (= true positive rate) =

TP
TP + FN

Specificity (= true negative rate) =

TN
FP + TN

F1 score (= harmonic mean of the precision and recall) = 2.T P +2.TF PP + F N
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) =

T P .T N − F P .F N

√(T P + F P ).(T P + F N ).(T N + F P ).(T N + F N )

Classification of symptom checkers’ outputs
Most COVID-19 symptom checkers return a human-readable text which contains an
association between entered symptoms and COVID-19. We classified these associations
into three different categories: high risk, medium risk and low risk. Examples of a high,
medium and low risk classifications are “There is a high risk that COVID-19 is causing
your symptoms”, “Your symptoms are worrisome and may be related to COVID-19” and
“There's nothing at present to suggest that you have coronavirus (COVID-19). Please
practice physical/social distancing” respectively. Our full text-output to risk mapping for
all symptom checkers and all text outputs is given in ​S5 Table​.

Some symptom checkers only have two possible outputs: COVID-19 risk or no COVID-19
risk. In order to make symptom checkers with three and two risk levels comparable we
performed two analysis versions: (a) medium risk and high risk is treated as COVID-19
positive (and low risk as COVID-19 as negative) and (b) high risk is treated as COVID-19
positive (and low risk and medium risk as COVID-19 negative).

Bootstrapping
To evaluate the robustness of our statistical measures and account for the unbalanced
dataset, we performed bootstrapping across our cases. A total of 3000 random samples
consisting of 50 COVID-19 cases and 50 control cases were created by sampling with
replacement from the original set of 50 COVID-19 cases and the 410 control cases.

Results
Sensitivity and specificity
In order to analyse the performance of the 10 online symptom checkers, we calculated
the sensitivity and the specificity of each symptom checker based on the cases
described in the method section. A scatterplot between sensitivity and specificity to
COVID-19 of the different symptom checkers is given in ​Fig 1​ and detailed numerics in
S6 Table​ and ​S7 Table​. These symptom checkers fall roughly into four groups: upper left
corner, lower right corner, central region, upper right corner.
Further analysis of true and false case classifications of these groups shows that the
group in the upper left corner is composed of symptom checkers that require one (or

few) highly specific symptoms to be present in order to classify a case as COVID-19
positive (e.g. “intensive contact with a COVID-19 positive person”). By this way, these
symptom checkers miss many COVID-19 positive patients that did not report exactly this
highly specific symptom. Vice versa such highly specific symptoms are hardly present in
non-COVID-19 cases. This results in low sensitivity and high specificity.
The group in the lower right corner is composed of symptom checkers which predict a
case as COVID-19 positive based on the presence of one or few COVID-19 associated
symptoms, e.g. the presence of fever or cough is enough to predict a patient as
COVID-19 positive. These checkers classify nearly every patient that has a respiratory
disorder or viral infection as COVID-19 positive. As such, they do not miss many
COVID-19 patients but wrongly predict many non-COVID-19 patients as COVID-19
positive. This results in low specificity and high sensitivity.
The group in the more central region is composed of symptom checkers which use a
more balanced prediction but exhibit limited success correctly classifying COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19 patients.
The group in the upper right corner is composed of symptom checkers which also use a
more balanced “symptoms to COVID-19 association model” but in this case, the
classification between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients is more successful.

Constraining symptoms for Symptoma
As Symptoma exhibits the best combination of sensitivity and specificity, we focused
our analysis on Symptoma’s performance. Symptoma allows free-text input of one's
symptoms and thereby a more precise representation of the clinical test cases. The
other symptom checkers do not allow free text input which limits the number of
possible symptoms considerably (​Fig 2A​). In order to investigate how Symptoma would
perform if constrained, we performed pairwise comparisons where Symptoma is only

allowed to use the symptoms of another symptom checker. In this setup, Symptoma is
massively disadvantaged as it can not use its full abilities. For example, in the pairwise
comparison with “Your.MD”, Symptoma considers only “fever”, “dry cough”, “shortness
of breath”, and “contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case” for the classification of cases.
The results of this analysis are summarised in ​Fig 2B ​, the sensitivity and specificity
scatter plots are provided in the ​S8 Fig​ and detailed numerics in ​S9 Table​ and ​S10 Table​.
Under these constraints and when COVID-19 positive is defined by high risk only,
Symptoma still significantly outperforms Apple and Cleveland Clinic, while performing
statistically similar to six of the remaining symptom checkers (upper panel of ​Fig 2B​).
When COVID-19-positive is defined by high and medium risk (lower panel of ​Fig 2B​),
Symptoma’s constrained performance is similar to seven of the other checkers, while
outperforming Ada and Docyet. For Apple, Babylon, CDC, Cleveland Clinic, Providence
and “Your.MD” the performance is about the same. When Symptoma is allowed to use
all symptoms of the case descriptions, it clearly outperforms all other checkers (dashed
blue line in ​Fig 2B​). This suggests that performance is directly related to the number of
symptom’s any given checker considers as input, and as such, free-text input
(non-constrained) will normally lead to a higher likelihood of correct diagnosis.

Discussion
We classified 50 COVID-19 case descriptions from the recent literature as well as 410
non-COVID-19 control cases with ten different online COVID-19 symptom checkers. Only
two out of ten symptom checkers showed a reasonably good balance between
sensitivity and specificity: namely Infermedica (F​1​=0.80) and Symptoma (F​1​=0.92). Most
other checkers are either too sensitive, classifying almost all patients as COVID-19
positive, or too specific, classifying many COVID-19 patients as COVID-19 negative (see
Fig 1​). For example, our BMJ control cases contain a patient suffering from a pulmonary
disease who presents with various symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of
breath, the three most frequent symptoms associated with COVID-19. Symptoma uses
the additional symptoms and risk factors not considered by the other checkers, namely
loss of appetite, green sputum, and a history of smoking, to discern the correct
diagnosis of COVID-19 negative. Five of the other checkers consider this case as high
risk.
Furthermore, most of the symptom checkers are even out-performed by our simplistic
symptom frequency vector approaches (SF-DIST (F​1​=0.57) and SF-COS (F​1​=0.79)).
Notably, the cosine version shows surprisingly good results outperforming 8 out of 10
symptom checkers based on the F​1 ​score.
To our knowledge this is the first scientific evaluation of online COVID-19 symptom
checkers, however, there are a number of related studies evaluating symptom
checkers. These include a study that evaluated 23 general-purpose symptom checkers

based on 45 clinical case descriptions across a wide range of medical conditions and
found that the correct diagnosis was on average listed among the top 20 results of the
checkers in 58% of all cases ​[2]​. This study design was extended for five additional
symptom checkers using ear, nose and throat (ENT) cases showing similar results ​[8]​.
Other evaluations include symptom checkers used for knee pain cases that found,
based on 527 patients and 26 knee problems, that the physician’s diagnosis was present
within the prediction list in 89% of the cases while the specificity was only 27% ​[9]​. In
another study, an analysis of a university students’ automated self-assessment triage
system prior to an in-person consultation with a medical doctor found that the system’s
urgency rating agreed perfectly in only 39% of cases while for the remaining cases the
system tended to be more risk averse than the doctor ​[10]​. Also, the applicability of
online symptom checkers for 79 persons aged ≥50 years based on "think-aloud"
protocols ​[11]​, deep learning algorithms for medical imaging ​[12]​, and services for
urgent care ​[3]​ were evaluated.
If the performance of any (COVID-19) online symptom checker is acceptable depends on
the perspective and use of the results. In the case of COVID-19, an online assessment
can not fully replace a PCR-test as some people are asymptomatic, while others
presenting with very specific COVID-19 symptoms might, in fact, have a very similar but
different disease. Regardless, online COVID-19 symptom checkers can act as a first
triage shield to take pressure off from in-person physician visits or hospitals. Symptom
checkers could even replace telephone triage lines in which non-medically trained
personnel read a predefined sequence of questions. Even though this was not part of

this study, the authors believe that COVID-19 symptom checkers (if appropriately
maintained and tested) might also be more reliable than the direct use of search
engines such as Google or information via social media.
The strength of this study lies in the fact that it is based on a large number (n=460) of
real patients’ case descriptions from the literature and a detailed evaluation on the best
performing symptom checker (​Fig 2​). Vice versa, a potential weakness of this study lies
in using real literature-based cases, which might have biased the test set to rather
severe cases of COVID-19, as mild and uninteresting cases are usually not found in the
literature. We countered this bias by not including extreme edge cases from the
literature into our 50 COVID-19 cases. Another bias might be that our control case
descriptions do not report a “COVID-19 contact”, even though a person with, for
example a cold, might have had a COVID-19 contact (and did not get infected). Another
limit of this study is the non-straight forward mapping of the symptom checker outputs
to risk levels (​S5 Table​). The interpretation of the textual output is debatable in some
cases. We countered this by allowing three different risk levels and merging them
together in two different ways (see ​Fig 1​A​ and ​Fig 1​B)​. We also classified every symptom
checker output by multiple persons until consensus was reached.

Conclusion
Symptom checkers are being widely used in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.
As such, quality assessment of these tools is critical. We show that various online
COVID-19 symptom checkers vary widely in their predictive capabilities, with some
