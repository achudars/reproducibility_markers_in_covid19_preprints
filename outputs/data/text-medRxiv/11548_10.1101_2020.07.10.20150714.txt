Abstract

14

Background: Patients at high risk of severe forms of COVID-19 frequently suffer from chronic

15

diseases, but other risk factors may also play a role. Environmental stressors, such as

16

endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can contribute to certain chronic diseases and might

17

aggravate the course of COVID-19.

18

Objectives: To explore putative links between EDCs and COVID-19 severity, an integrative

19

systems biology approach was constructed and applied.

20

Methods: As a first step, relevant data sets were compiled from major data sources.

21

Biological associations of major EDCs to proteins were extracted from the CompTox

22

database. Associations between proteins and diseases known as important COVID-19

23

comorbidities were obtained from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Based on these

24

data, we developed a tripartite network (EDCs-proteins-diseases) and used it to identify

25

proteins overlapping between the EDCs and the diseases. Signaling pathways for common

26

proteins were then investigated by over-representation analysis.

27

Results: We found several statistically significant pathways that may be dysregulated by

28

EDCs and that may also be involved in COVID-19 severity. The Th17 and the AGE/RAGE

29

signaling pathways were particularly promising.

33

COVID-19 severity, thereby highlighting possible links between exposure to environmental

chemicals and disease development. This study also documents the application of

35

computational systems biology methods as a relevant approach to increase the

36

understanding of molecular mechanisms linking EDCs and human diseases, thereby

Introduction

42

The COVID-19 pandemic started in the fall of 2019 and spread to a large part of the

43

world during the winter and spring of 2020. By late June 2020, it had led to more than

44

500,000 deaths, of which one-fourth in the US and about 175,000 in the EU

45

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, https://covid19.who.int/). Despite considerable

46

research activities, there are still many unknowns concerning this infectious disease,

47

especially with regard to the substantial variability of the disease severity. Following an

48

initial infectious phase, a “cytokine storm”, leading to pneumonia is observed in severe cases

49

which may require intensive care. It is still unclear why infections lead to severe cases in

50

some patients and not in others, but both endogenous and exogenous factors can likely

51

influence the outcome of the disease.

52

In addition to older age and male sex, several comorbidities are associated with

53

severe COVID-19 and increased mortality risk. Disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type

54

II diabetes (T2D), obesity, chronic respiratory disease or hypertension are strongly linked to

55

severe COVID-19 cases (Petrilli et al. 2020)(Zhou et al. 2020)(Stefan et al. 2020). As has

56

recently been proposed, underlying metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions may be

57

mechanistically linked to the exacerbation of the coronavirus infection (Bornstein et al.

58

2020), and these observations may inspire new insight into the pathogenesis of this disease,

59

including biological interpretation of the mechanisms involved. Environmental stressors

60

have already been suggested to contribute to the severity of the disease (Bashir et al. 2020;

61

Fattorini and Regoli 2020; Zhu et al. 2020), but little mechanistic support for this association

62

is available. A relevant approach would be to compare the biological pathways triggered by

63

environmental stressors with those involved in the COVID-19 severity. If similar pathways

64

are found, this would increase the likelihood that such stressors may contribute to critical

65

stages of this disease.

66

Given the suspected hormonal mode of vulnerability (Drucker 2020) endocrine

67

disrupting chemicals (EDCs) could represent important triggers of aggravated infection, e.g.,

68

in the form of phthalates, bisphenols, organochlorine pesticides, and perfluorinated alkane

69

substances (PFASs) (Trasande et al. 2016; Vandenberg et al. 2016). Exposure to these

70

substances may affect the immune defense, thus potentially increasing the susceptibility to

71

develop COVID-19 (Tsatsakis et al. 2020), as supported by experimental studies(Cipelli et al.

72

2014; Couleau et al. 2015). For example, epidemiological evidence on children exposed to

73

PFASs show decreased immune responses to routine vaccines (Grandjean et al. 2012) and a

74

greater risk of developing infectious disease(Dalsager et al. 2016; Granum et al. 2013).

75

As promising tools to gain better insight into the possible risk factors and

76

mechanisms, toxicological and chemical data sources have expanded substantially, thereby

77

enabling network science and computational systems biology methods to become feasible

78

(Audouze et al. 2013, 2018; Taboureau and Audouze 2017; Vermeulen et al. 2020; Wu et al.

79

2020). We have therefore conducted an integrative systems biology exploration to identify

80

overlapping proteins that are both dysregulated by EDCs and involved in comorbidities

81

associated with aggravated COVID-19. Based on this tripartite network, integrating protein-

82

EDC associations and protein-disease annotations, we then performed biological

83

enrichments of pathways to detect the most plausible relationships between EDC exposure

84

and COVID-19 severity.

87

Methods

88

We employed a computational systems biology approach to explore putative linkages

89

between EDCs and COVID-19 as presented in Figure 1. First, a tripartite network was created

90

based on known associations between proteins and either COVID-19 comorbidities or EDCs,

91

as compiled from existing databases (CompTox, DisGeNET, GeneCards) (A). Then, biological

92

enrichment was performed with the jointly identified proteins (i.e., those retrieved in both

93

association studies) (B) by over-representation analysis (ORA) to identify the pathways that

94

were the highly linked to both the diseases and the EDCs (C). As a final step, the biological

95

pathways were explored with available knowledge regarding COVID-19 mechanisms (from

96

the literature and the AOP-Wiki database), thereby allowing consideration of hypothetical

97

linkages between EDCs and COVID-19 (D).

98

Endocrine-disrupting chemical dataset

99

A list of 34 commonly used substances known or suspected to act as EDCs was established,

100

based on knowledge from three data sources: the endocrine disruptor assessment list from

101

ECHA (https://echa.europa.eu/fr/ed-assessment, as of April 24, 2020), the one from NIEHS

102

(https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm as of April 28, 2020),

103

and the TEDX database (https://endocrinedisruption.org/interactive-tools/tedx-list-of-

104

potential-endocrine-disruptors/search-the-tedx-list, as of April 24,2020).

105

To explore as much as possible the chemical diversities, EDCs for this study were further

106

selected to represent different chemical classes (Table 1). The CAS numbers were used for

107

data integration.

108

Disease dataset

109

Comorbidities known to be associated with obesity or otherwise leading to severe COVID-19

110

were extracted from a recent study (Stefan et al. 2020), and resulted in a total of 13

111

disorders for exploration in the integrative systems toxicology (Table2).

112

Endocrine-disrupting chemical-protein associations

113

Human proteins known to be associated with each of the 34 EDCs were extracted from the

114

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency web-based CompTox Chemistry dashboard, which

115

contains a wide range of data related to chemical toxicity, including

116

(as of April 30, 2020) (Williams et al. 2017). Each linked protein was matched to a gene

117

symbol and classified using the Panther (protein analysis through evolutionary relationships)

118

classification system (version 15, released February 14, 2020) (Mi et al. 2013), a curated

in vitro

bioassays data

119

biological database of gene/protein families, and their functionally related subfamilies that

120

can be used to classify and identify the function of gene products.

121

Disease-protein associations

122

From two human protein-disease databases, proteins known to be linked to the 13 studied

123

diseases were listed (as of April 29, 2020 for both data sources). The DisGenNet database is a

124

discovery platform containing one of the largest publicly available collections of genes and

125

variants associated with human diseases(Piñero et al. 2015). The GeneCards database

126

contains manually curated information for substances and their associations to genes and

127

proteins, that are scored (Safran et al. 2010). For the present study, only associations were

128

kept only for those between human diseases and proteins categorized as coding proteins,

129

and all non-human information, including gene clusters, genetic locus, pseudogenes, RNA

130

genes and those uncategorized were disregarded. All listed proteins were matched to their

131

gene symbol to facilitate further analysis. Each identified protein from both databases, was

132

categorized into the protein class using the Panther classification (version 15).

133

Pathways enrichment analysis

134

To decipher biological pathways potentially linked to the selected EDCs and explore if they

135

might overlap with the ones known for COVID-19, an ORA was done. Four major sources of

136

protein-pathway information were independently integrated, i.e., using the Kyoto

137

Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the Reactome, the Wiki-pathways and the

138

Panther databases(Fabregat et al. 2018; Kanehisa et al. 2019; Mi et al. 2013; Slenter et al.

139

2018). To assess the statistical significance of the protein-pathway relationships, a

140

hypergeometric test was used for each of the four sources, followed by a multiple testing

141

correction of the p-values with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The ORA was performed on

142

the common proteins identified to identify the most strongly linked proteins that are

143

affected by the EDCs and also associated with at least one the 13 comorbidities. As a last

144

step, manual curation allowed us to consider relevant outcomes for interpretation. The four

145

data sources provided complementary information, with some overlapping findings.

146

COVID-19 and biological mechanism of action

147

Linkage between COVID-19 and potential biological targets and affected pathways were

148

extracted from the literature (as of May 22, 2020) and the AOP-Wiki database (as of May 22,

149

2020).

Results

152

Endocrine-disrupting chemical-protein associations

153

From the CompTox database, information on the links between chemicals and human

154

proteins were compiled. Data for 30 of the 34 chemicals could be retrieved, and a total of

155

208 unique human proteins were involved via 1632 associations. No information was

156

retrieved for hexachlorobenzene, nonylphenol ethoxylate, perchlorate and tributyltin.

157

Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) targeted the highest number of proteins (113), and

158

2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB 153) was associated with only one biological target

159

(the progesterone receptor). The most frequently affected proteins included the androgen

160

receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1), which were each linked to 23 EDCs,

161

whereas 61 individual proteins were associated with only one EDC.

162

To identify the biological targets that are most often affected by EDCs, proteins were

163

grouped in clusters according to their families, as based on the Panther classification system

164

(Figure 2). The majority of the 208 proteins related to EDCs belonged to 12 classes among

165

the 23 present in Panther, while the remaining proteins were classified as ‘uncategorized

166

protein class’. Each protein was assigned to only one category, although only one of them,

167

HLA-DRA, (HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR alpha chain) belonged to the

168

defense/immunity group. Other immunity-related proteins. such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) or

169

interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1A), were not associated with any class in the Panther classification.

170

We therefore manually added all immune system-related proteins to the “uncategorized

171

class”. Given that Bisphenol A (BPA) increases the release of these proteins(Ben-Jonathan et

172

al. 2009), and because antibodies to the IL-6 receptor (such as tocilizumab) or to the IL-1

173

receptor (such as Anakinra) are currently tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients

174

(Zhou et al. 2020), we also explored if the proteins selected could be mapped to defense

175

and/or immunity biological categories. For this purpose, we used the Gene Ontology (GO)

176

classification (as of May 26, 2020), and among the 208 proteins dysregulated by EDCs, 58

177

were associated with inflammatory response, 75 with defense response, and 66 with

178

regulation of immune system process.

179

Disease-protein associations

180

Regarding diseases associated with human proteins, two databases were screened. From the

181

DisGeNET database, we were able to retrieve information for 8 of the 13 diseases, which

182

were connected to 3262 unique proteins via 7195 links (as of April 29, 2020). The proteins

7

183

were categorized in 22 protein classes using the Panther classification (version 15) (Figure

184

S1). Proteins that did not belong in any class were again grouped into the uncategorized

185

class. Obesity and diabetes were linked to proteins belonging to each of the 22 categories,

186

whereas insulin resistance and dyslipidemia were linked to only half of the categories.

187

From the GeneCards database, all 13 predisposing diseases were retrieved (as of 29 April

188

2020), and a total of 115,289 associations were identified between the diseases and 29,094

189

unique human proteins were extracted. Among them, only protein-coding information

190

according to HGNC, Ensembl or Entrez Gene were kept (proteins data related to biological

191

regions, gene clusters, genetic loci, pseudogenes, non-coding RNA genes and uncategorized

192

elements were not considered), thereby reducing the total number of unique protein to

193

18,931, representing 97,855 disease-protein links. As a next step, grouping of the proteins

194

using the Panther classification system allowed identification of 23 clusters correspond to

195

the 23 different protein classes (Figure S2). Each protein was assigned to only one category,

196

except for ameloblastin (AMBN), which was associated with both ‘extracellular matrix

197

protein’ and ‘structural protein’. Proteins not associated with Panther classes, were again

198

grouped into the uncategorized class. Excluding the viral or transposable element protein

199

class, all diseases (except dyslipidemia) were associated with all the other Panther classes.

200

In order to keep the most relevant protein-disease associations obtained from the

201

GeneCards database, data were filtered based on their scores. The GeneCards scores are

202

calculated based on publications mentioning a protein and a disease, using a Boolean model.

203

The higher the score, the more relevant the protein-disease association is. Among the

204

97,855 links between the 13 diseases and 18,931 proteins, the score values ranged between

205

0.13 (representing very low association) to 228 (very high evidence for a protein-disease

206

connection). After evaluation of the extracted data (number of proteins by GeneCards

207

scores), we selected associations with a score ≥ 20 (see Figure S3). Within this threshold, a

208

total of 5732 associations were retained that link the 12 diseases with 2079 unique human

209

proteins (no information was retained for ‘dyslipidemias’ from the GeneCards database).

210

Generating a tripartite network of protein-EDC-disease associations

211

A human bipartite associative network of proteins and the 13 diseases was created. Among

212

the 3262 unique proteins from the DisGeNET, and the 2079 proteins from the GeneCards

213

databases, 1157 were overlapping proteins and only 922 and 2105 proteins were uniquely

214

associated with GeneCards or DisGeNET, respectively. All 4184 unique proteins were again

215

grouped into 23 clusters using the Panther classification (the class ‘viral or transposable

216

element protein’ was not kept after the cleaning step. Among the groupings, we retrieved a

217

cluster of proteins linked to the ‘defense/immunity’ category. These results were merged

218

with the bipartite protein-EDCs network to develop a tripartite network (Figure 2).

219

Translation into pathways

220

To identify biological pathways that may be involved in the predisposing diseases while also

221

being dysregulated by the EDCs, we first analyzed the overlaps between the two sets of

222

proteins. Among the proteins identified from the three data sources, 98 were common

223

(Figure S4), and all of them were mapped to unique Entrez GeneID, and could therefore be

224

used for biological enrichment analyses, which were performed independently using four

225

data sources (KEGG, Reactome, Wiki-pathways and Panther). The ORA analysis revealed

226

several statistically significant pathways linked to interleukins/cytokines signaling,

227

intracellular signaling pathways and, regulation of metabolic pathways (Table 3).

228

Interestingly, the different data sources showed very significant associations with common

229

pathways, such as interleukins (IL) related pathways: IL-4 and IL-13, IL-10 signaling pathways

230

(padj < E-16, and padj of 2.85E-09 respectively, Reactome), IL-17 signaling pathway (padj of

231

1.05E-10, KEGG), IL-3, IL-5 and IL-18 signaling pathways (padj of 1.09E-09, 2.52E-09, 1.49E-08

232

respectively, Wiki-pathways), the IL-signaling pathways (padj of 1.10E-05, Panther); or the

233

Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (padj 3.91E-09 for KEGG, padj of 0.99 for Panther and padj

234

1.93E-08 for Wiki-pathways).

235

Among the most significant pathways, several were retrieved from each of the data sources

236

with relation to the AGE/RAGE pathway (i.e. Advanced Glycation End products and its

237

receptor), which is known to cause cellular stress and inflammation. The AGE are formed

238

non-enzymatically, by Maillard reaction products (carbohydrates with proteins and/or lipids)

239

and bind to the RAGE. Formation of AGE has been associated with chronic diseases such as

240

type 2 diabetes (Cai et al. 2012; Menini et al. 2018). Similarly, the stress or inflammatory

241

pathways (e.g shear stress, defined as the tangential force exerted by the blood flow on the

242

vascular endothelium, TNF-alpha) are highlighted by our analysis; the shear stress activates

243

the AhR signaling pathway, which is also involved in the regulation of IL-17 production by the

244

Th17 lymphocytes; interleukin 17 has been suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of

245

COVID19(Gutiérrez-Vázquez and Quintana 2018; Han et al. 2008; Pacha et al. 2020).

246

Interestingly, inflammation is suspected to influence insulin resistance.

Exploration of EDCs linkage to COVID-19

248

To explore putative links between COVID-19 and exposure to EDCs, we first screened the

249

AOP-Wiki database, and then further examined the pathways identified using literature

250

references.

251

In the AOP-Wiki database, only one AOP was related to COVID-19, and it involves several key

252

events, such as ‘increased pro-inflammatory mediators’ (KE 1496), ‘increased inflammatory

253

immune responses’ (KE 1750), which leads to the adverse outcome ‘increased mortality’ (AO

254

351). Such knowledge-based linear chain of events highlights the importance of the link

255

between COVID-19 and inflammatory processes.

Discussion

259

In order to investigate possible links between exposure to EDCs and the severity of COVID-

260

19, we explored a computational systems biology approach. The tripartite network model

261

first linked EDCs to targeted proteins and then proteins related to diseases that predispose

262

to more serious COVID-19 development, thereby allowing us to identify common signaling

263

pathways. The identification of such joint pathways and their role as possible targets of EDCs

264

highlights the potential links between exposure to environmental chemicals and COVID-19

265

severity.

266

This integrative approach can be easily applied as a new approach methodology (NAM)

267

(Bopp et al. 2019), which may offer support to methods alternative to animal testing or to

268

identify biological pathways that require more focused laboratory study. Previous studies

269

have demonstrated that systems chemical toxicology models combined with computational

270

network biology may help in understanding chemical toxicity in humans (Hartung et al. 2017;

271

Nie et al. 2015; Taboureau and Audouze 2017). Our tripartite network supports the notion

272

that exposure to EDCs may contribute to aggravation of COVID-19. Although major links

273

were identified at extremely low p values, the approach relies on existing information

274

available in within the very substantive data sources, but some causal associations may have

275

been overlooked or disregarded because of missing or incomplete information.

276

To assess the validity of our approach, a more focused expert analysis was attempted, where

277

we selected the Th17 and the AGE/RAGE signaling pathways because of their

278

pathophysiological relevance in the context of COVID-19. The interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling

279

pathway plays several important roles, and IL-17 is produced by a pro-inflammatory subtype

280

of T helper lymphocytes named Th17 cells, located at mucosal barriers where they

281

contribute to pathogen clearance. The IL-17 produced stimulates the synthesis of cytokines

282

(IL1ß, TNF-alpha…) and chemokines (MCP-1…) by other cell types, thereby favoring the

283

recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils at inflammatory sites. However, an over-

284

activation of Th17 cells can lead to a hyper-inflammatory state which is deleterious (Pacha et

285

al. 2020).

286

The highly variable symptomatology associated with the infection by SARS-CoV-2 depends

287

on the levels of IL-17 and of other cytokines including IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-15, TNF-alpha and IFNγ.

288

The most deleterious effect of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is an acute lung injury leading to a

289

severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that is partly due to IL-17-related excessive

290

recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

291

Therefore, an increased basal level of IL-17 (in the absence of infection, for example due to

292

obesity or to induction by a chemical) might represent a lung injury risk associated with

293

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our finding of EDC linkage to this pathway is therefore of high

294

pathogenetic relevance.

295

Obesity promotes a high basal level of inflammation which contributes to insulin resistance

296

and type 2 diabetes(Goldberg 2009). This phenomenon is due to an infiltration of the

297

adipose tissue (AT) by macrophages and T cells and their production of various pro-

298

inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1ß, TNF-alpha, IL-17 and IL-6. Several EDCs are

299

suspected to be obesogenic (and are subsequently named obesogens). This has been

300

demonstrated for several substances (e.g. tributyltin) and linked to the stimulation of pro-

301

adipogenic signaling pathway (e.g. through PPARγ)(Egusquiza and Blumberg 2020). Similarly,

302

the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is highly expressed in Th17 cells and is an essential

303

contributor to the production of IL-17(Veldhoen et al. 2008). The AhR, known as the

304

receptor of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, is also activated by shear stress (SS), another

305

pathway highlighted in our computational analysis. Indeed, several studies have shown using

306

various endothelial models that laminar SS leads to the activation of two target genes of the

307

AhR, namely CYP1A1 and CYP1B1(Conway et al. 2009). Two recent studies suggest an

308

indirect link between SARS-CoV-2 and SS by showing that the expression of ACE2

309

(angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the receptor of the virus, is increased by SS (Song et al.

310

2020).

311

These observations support a dual impact of EDCs on IL-17 production and inflammatory

312

state; this impact could be indirect due to the effect of these chemicals on obesity or

313

through a direct stimulation of several signaling pathways, such as AhR or PPARγ, leading to

314

an overproduction of systemic IL-17; the shear stress pathway represents an additional link

315

between AhR activation and the EDC/disease connection. The implication of shear stress

316

also suggests a possible contribution of increased expression of ACE2, the receptor of the

317

SARS-CoV-2. While the role of these pathways at the nexus between exposure to EDCs and

318

COVID-19 severity appears to be relevant, their actual contribution remains to be

319

demonstrated and their putative role as therapeutic targets remains to be further

320

substantiated.

321

Our integrative systems biology study also indicates a strong statistical association between

322

the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway, chronic diseases and EDC effects. This is likely due to the

323

well-known links between this pathway and type 2 diabetes(Ravichandran et al. 2019).

324

Indeed, hyperglycemia leads to increased amounts of glycation products and their

325

metabolites which results in the activation of the RAGE receptors. The latter are highly

326

expressed in endothelial cells, and their activation leads to increased oxidative stress and

327

inflammation and ultimately to endothelial damage, thrombotic disorders and vascular

328

diseases (Egaña-Gorroño et al. 2020). Other endogenous ligands can also activate RAGE,

329

among them HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1), an extra-cellular protein also linked to a

330

variety of inflammatory responses(Andersson et al. 2020). Interestingly, the AGE/RAGE

331

signaling pathway is highly expressed in the lung vasculature and has been implicated in

332

several pulmonary diseases(Oczypok et al. 2017). All these observations support the

333

implication of the AGE/RAGE signaling pathway in vascular, thrombotic and lung diseases

334

which are the hallmarks of COVID-19 severity. Interestingly, there are also complex

335

connections between HMGB1 and ACE2 which is the receptor for SARS-Cov2 and other

336

coronaviruses(Luft 2016). These results are in accordance with recent proposals in published

337

commentaries of environmental chemical impacts on COVID-19 progress(Andersson et al.

338

2020; Rojas et al. 2020).

339

The three-way approach did not attempt to identify direct immunotoxic effects due to

340

environmental chemicals otherwise considered to be EDCs. However, some of the EDCs

341

selected, i.e., PCB-153, PFOA and PFOS, are known to have immunotoxic properties

342

(Heilmann et al.), and the same is true for some common air pollutants (Tsatsakis et al.

343

2020). Accordingly, the impact of environmental chemicals on COVID-19 severity demands

344

attention.

345
346

Conclusions

347

The results of this computational study appear as a promising initial step toward

348

systematically linking a major group of environmental chemicals to the severity of COVID-19,

349

although the findings need to be further supported by high-throughput screening tests,

350

clinical and experimental data. Nevertheless, these observations bridge environmental

351

stressors and infectious diseases and support an integrated exposome approach. Preliminary

Figure 1. Overview of the integrative systems toxicology approach. A: Human proteins

534

known to be dysregulated by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were extracted from

535

the CompTox database; human proteins linked to obesity or to comorbidities or metabolic

536

dysfunction known to be associated with obesity were compiled using DisGeNET and

537

GeneCards. These compiled data were used to develop a tripartite network.

538

proteins was identified that was common to both association studies (proteins targeted by

539

the EDCs and also involved in comorbidities). C: Biological enrichment was performed for

540

pathways for each of the four databases, by over-representation analysis (ORA) to identify

541

potential mechanisms of action related to these proteins, where the biological pathways

542

were ranked by their statistical significance. D: The most relevant of the potential pathways

543

were compared to known COVID-19 dysregulated pathways from the literature and the AOP-

544

Wiki database.

B: A set of

Figure 2. Tripartite network representation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals-proteins-

547

diseases relationships. First, a bipartite network of the 208 human proteins known to be

548

dysregulated by the 30 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) was created as extracted from

549

the CompTox database. Each yellow diamond node represents an EDC, and edges are the

550

interactions between EDCs and proteins. Then, a second bipartite network was generated

551

for the 4184 human proteins known to be linked to the 13 predisposing diseases, as

552

extracted from the DisGeNET (3262 links) and GeneCards (2079 links) databases. Each red

553

square node represents a disease, and edges are the interactions between diseases and

554

proteins. A total of 1156 proteins were overlapping. All proteins were grouped using the

555

Panther classification system (version 15) and are represented by circles (colors are

556

according to their Panther family classes).
