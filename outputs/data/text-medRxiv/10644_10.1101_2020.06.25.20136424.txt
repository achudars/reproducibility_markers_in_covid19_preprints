Abstract

18

Background

19

The worldwide shortage of single-use N95 respirators and surgical masks due to the COVID-

20

19 pandemic has forced many health care personnel to prolong the use of their existing

21

equipment as much as possible. In many cases, workers cover respirators with available masks in

22

an attempt to extend their effectiveness against the virus. Due to low mask supplies, many people

23

instead are using face coverings improvised from common fabrics. Our goal was to determine

24

what fabrics would be most effective in both practices.

25
26
27

Methods and findings
We examined the hydrophobicity of fabrics (silk, cotton, polyester), as measured by their

28

resistance to the penetration of small and aerosolized water droplets, an important transmission

29

avenue for the virus causing COVID-19. We also examined the breathability of these fabrics and

30

their ability to maintain hydrophobicity despite undergoing repeated cleaning. Tests were done

31

when fabrics were fashioned as an overlaying barrier and also when constructed as do-it-yourself

32

face coverings. As a protective barrier and face covering, silk is more effective at impeding the

33

penetration and absorption of droplets due to its greater hydrophobicity relative to other tested

34

fabrics. Silk face coverings repelled droplets as well as masks, but unlike masks they are

35

hydrophobic and can be readily sterilized for immediate reuse.

Conclusions

38

Silk is an effective hydrophobic barrier to droplets, more breathable than other fabrics that

39

trap humidity, and are readily re-useable via cleaning. Therefore, silk can serve as an effective

40

material for protecting respirators under clinical conditions and as a material for face coverings.

Introduction
Personal protective equipment (PPE), specifically N95 respirators and surgical masks, are

44

vital to protect against viral transmission during the current COVID-19 pandemic, yet global

45

shortages of these items will likely continue in many locations for the foreseeable future.

46

Although respirators and masks used by health care providers (HCP) and essential workers (EW)

47

form part of the critical armament against COVID-19, a significant drawback of PPE are that

48

they are purposed for only single use. Sterilization of PPE, especially respirators, has been

49

implemented to enable their continued and repeated use, but this approach reduces the ability of

50

respirators to effectively block particles, can induce damage, or may render the equipment unsafe

51

for further usage [1].

52

In some cases, HCPs and EWs may only have a single respirator provided to them at their

53

workplace and must reuse them indefinitely under hazardous work conditions. To prolong the

54

life of respirators, many HCPs have adopted the clinical practice of wearing multiple pieces of

55

PPE simultaneously, e.g., a mask on top of a respirator (Fig 1A) [2-4]. This strategy is

56

unsustainable as increased thickness hampers breathing [3] and increases moisture near the

57

wearer’s face, thus becoming a conduit for viral transmission [5,6]. Masks also cannot be

58

adequately cleaned without compromising their protective properties. In many cases, HCPs and

59

EWs remain vulnerable as they have resorted to using (and reusing) less efficient masks on their

60

own when respirators are unavailable, leaving them at greater risk to viral transmission.

PPE shortages are now affecting the general population, especially employees instructed to

71

wear masks in the workplace as well as people in public places where mask wearing is

72

mandatory or strongly recommended as part of public health policy [7,8]. As a result, the

73

majority of the general public has been reduced to using improvised face coverings constructed

74

from commercially available materials (Fig 1B) [9,10]. Although the primary purpose of face

75

coverings is to minimize potential viral transmission from the wearer to others [11], they can also

76

provide some protection to the wearer from external sources [12,13]. Cloth, such as cotton, has

77

been suggested as a suitable material for face coverings [14,15], but it remains an open question

78

as to what material possesses the best suite of characteristics to block droplets and viral particles,

79

as well as what material best facilitates comfort, wearability, and reuse of face coverings.

80

To help combat the PPE shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we examined what

81

materials can serve as immediate solutions for (a) fashioning effective, protective barrier layers

82

that serve to increase the longevity of respirators and the effectiveness of masks under clinical

83

conditions, and (b) for the construction of face coverings to be worn according to current public

84

health guidelines when standard PPE is not available. We focused on the properties of silk, a

85

material commonly used in the garment industry, which is a natural, fibrous biomaterial

86

produced by animals such as moths and spiders. For example, silk moth caterpillars, such as

87

those of the domesticated silk moth, Bombyx mori, and of the Robin moth, Hyalophora cecropia,

88

produce and use silk for spinning their cocoons [16-18]; these structures consist of hydrophobic

89

and semi-impermeable membranes [19,20] that protect the developing moth residing inside from

90

harsh environmental conditions [20-22]. In addition, protein fibers in silk have been shown to

91

have antimicrobial, antibacterial, and antiviral properties [23-26]. Silk is already used in

92

biomedical applications such as surgical sutures [26], and current research on silk has examined

93

its utility as a biomaterial for many biomedical and human health applications [27-28]. Previous

94

work examining the use of commercially available fabrics for improvised face coverings has also

95

shown that silk possesses some capacity as an antimicrobial barrier when used alone for the

96

fabrication of face coverings [29] and has increased filtration efficiency with more layers [13].

Experimental design

100

We tested silk material relative to other commercially available fabrics as a protective barrier

101

layer over existing PPE (Fig 1A) and as a material for the construction of face coverings (Fig

102

1B). We evaluated five types of material that consisted of animal-derived silk that was natural

103

and unmanipulated (i.e., cocoon walls of B. mori and H. cecropia) or processed (unwashed and

104

washed 100% mulberry silk from pillowcases), processed plant-derived (100% cotton) and

105

synthetic (polyester) fabrics, as well as a water-absorbent material as a positive control (paper

106

towels, see S1 File for material details). These processed fabrics (silk, cotton, and polyester)

107

represent commonly available materials that can be readily used for making protective layers and

108

face coverings. For processed silk, we tested both washed and unwashed silk to examine if the

109

material properties of silk might be altered by standard cleaning techniques (i.e., washing).

110

We compared the different fabric groups in their level of hydrophobicity, functionally

111

characterized by their ability to block either water or aerosolized droplets (from spray), vehicles

112

for the transmission of the virus underlying COVID-19 [30]. Greater hydrophobicity was defined

113

as the starting contact angles of droplets being greater than 90°, which produces increased

114

resistance to the penetration of droplets into the fabric. We assessed hydrophobicity by first

115

measuring the contact angle behavior of an individual water droplet (5 µL and 2 µL volumes)

116

deposited onto the surface of these materials using the sessile drop technique. In these tests,

117

greater contact angles that are more consistent over time indicate greater hydrophobicity. We

118

also measured the saturation propensity of a droplet (2 µL) and the rate of gas exchange over a

119

24-hour period through the material to examine the ability of water (liquid and vapor) to

120

penetrate through the material. Gas exchange rates are a measure of porosity and therefore

121

breathability. We also compared the performance of single and multi-layered silk in saturation

122

trials. Finally, we compared the different fabric types and commercially available surgical

123

masks, in terms of penetration of aerosolized droplets delivered as spray through the material, via

124

a modified custom apparatus [31]. We also tested vertical aerosolized spray after sterilization

125

where face coverings were sterilized a total of five times using a dry-heat oven at 70 °C. In all

126

experiments, we tested three different sources for each material type and performed three

127

technical replicates for each source of fabric. Thickness measurements were made in three

129

and sterilization are found in S1 File.

130
131
132

Data analysis
For contact angle trials (both larger 5 µL and smaller 2 µL droplets), we compared the

133

different material types in terms of their starting, dynamic (i.e., change over time), and final

134

contact angles during trials, and the magnitude change in contact angle between the start and

135

final measurements. We analyzed starting and dynamic contact angles, and the magnitude

136

change in contact angle, using a two-way ANCOVA with material thickness as a covariate.

137

Dynamic contact angle data were analyzed using a linear mixed-effect model with group and

138

time as a fixed effect interaction, and fabric sample as the random effect. Individual models were

139

compared against a null using a likelihood ratio test, and the conditional and marginal r2 are

140

reported for each model [32]. We analyzed saturation propensity using a two-way ANCOVA

141

with material thickness as a covariate. Gas exchange data were first log10-transformed to meet

142

assumptions of normality, and then compared among material types using a one-way ANOVA.

143

Comparisons of the percentage of samples that were penetrated by a 2 µL water droplet for

144

either single or multilayered silk fabric layers were analyzed using a Fisher’s Exact omnibus test,

145

which was then followed by pairwise Fisher’s Exact tests with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.016).

146

Relative to when no face covering was present over a testing surface, we compared the capability

147

of face coverings (cotton, silk, and polyester) and surgical masks to repel aerosolized droplets

148

(i.e., resist penetration and saturation by aerosol droplets delivered via spray) using a one-way

149

ANOVA. All data were analyzed in R [33]. Significance was set to α = 0.05 except when

150

adjusted for multiple pairwise comparisons.

Results

153

Testing the performance of material for use as protective barriers and face coverings

154

We found that material groups differed significantly in starting contact angles for both

155

droplet volumes tested (5 µL – ANCOVA: F6,55=16.88, P<0.001; η2=0.62, ηp2=0.64; 2 µL –

156

ANCOVA: F6,55=20.36, P<0.001; η2=0.68, ηp2=0.69). In all trials, silk-based materials (B. mori

157

and H. cecropia cocoons, unwashed and washed silk) were found to be hydrophobic, as they had

158

starting contact angles approximately or greater than 90° (S1 Table). In contrast, cotton,

159

polyester, and paper towel materials were classified as hydrophilic as starting angles were far

160

below 90° or had immediate droplet absorption (S1 Table). Thickness was significantly related

161

to the starting contact angle for both droplet types (5 µL – ANCOVA: F1,55=4.47, P=0.039;

162

η2=0.03, ηp2=0.08; 2 µL – ANCOVA: F1,55=6.87, P<0.05; η2=0.04, ηp2=0.11).

163

In all trials, there was a significant interaction between material group and time for dynamic

164

contact angles (5 µL – χ2 = 778.58, df=13, P<0.001; marginal r2=0.62, conditional r2=0.94; 2 µL

165

– χ2 =549.18, df=13, P<0.001; marginal r2=0.46, conditional r2=0.93). Hydrophilic materials

166

(cotton, polyester, paper towel), in combination with a lower starting contact angle, had a faster

167

change in contact angle as the droplet was almost immediately absorbed. The droplet stayed on

168

longer, resulting in a gradual change over time, for hydrophobic materials (Fig 2, S2 Table).

174

starting contact angles above 90° which indicated a hydrophobic surface, while the other fabric

175

types had contact angles less than 90°, indicating a hydrophilic surface. For 2 µL droplets, B.

176

mori, washed silk, and unwashed silk all had mean starting contact angles above 90°, which

177

indicates a hydrophobic surface. The remaining fabric groups had contact angles below 90°

178

indicating a hydrophilic surface.

179
180

Final contact angles also differed significantly between groups for both droplet volumes

181

tested (5 µL – ANCOVA: F6,55=13.02, P<0.001; η2=0.62, ηp2=0.64; 2 µL – ANCOVA:

182

F6,55=8.72, P<0.001; η2=0.52, ηp2=0.56). Thickness was significantly related to the final contact

183

angle for all droplet trials (5 µL – ANCOVA: F1,55=25.04, P<0.001; η2=0.16, ηp2=0.31; 2 µL –

184

ANCOVA: F1,55=19.43, P<0.001; η2=0.15, ηp2=0.26; S1 Table).

185

The magnitude of change from start to final contact angles was significantly different across

186

material groups for all trials (5 µL – ANOVA: F6,56=3.48, P<0.01; η2=0.27; 2 µL – ANOVA:

187

F6,56=3.93, P<0.01; η2=0.30). Post hoc pairwise comparisons, however, indicated only significant

188

differences involving paper towel with each other material group (S1 Table).

189

The saturation propensity of a 2 µL water droplet significantly differed between material

190

groups (ANCOVA: F6,49=55.875, P<0.001; η2=0.74, ηp2=0.87), with cotton and paper towel

191

having the largest droplet spread followed by the remaining groups (Table 1). Thickness was

192

significantly related to droplet area (ANCOVA: F1,49=7.14.884, P<0.001; η2=0.03, ηp2=0.23),

193

with a significant interaction between thickness and fabric type (ANCOVA: F6,49=9.772,

194

P<0.001; η2=0.13, ηp2=0.54). Gas exchange, a proxy for porosity, significantly differed between

195

groups (ANOVA: F6,56=16.643, P<0.001, η2=0.64). B. mori cocoons and cotton material had the

196

highest mean gas exchange rates relative to the other groups (Table 1).

There were significant differences in saturation area between the material groups. The covariate,

significantly decreased as the layers of silk increased from a single layer to either double or triple

(S3 Table). As the public typically wears face coverings with one or two layers, we compared the

213

capability of single and double layers for silk (washed and unwashed), cotton, and polyester

214

fabrics to resist penetration by aerosolized droplets. Vertical spray tests revealed significant

215

differences between each of the fabric groups and the control of no face covering, when face

216

coverings had one-layer (ANOVA: F5,42=18.66, P<0.001; η2=0.69) or two-layers (ANOVA:

217

F5,42=29.50, P<0.001; η2=0.78). There were no differences between any fabric groups, however.

220

Exposure of face coverings and masks to vertical aerosolized spray after sterilization
To examine the effects of sterilization, we compared face coverings made from our different

221

test fabrics using recommendations from the CDC [7] with surgical masks. Discoloration of the

222

test surface from the aerosolized spray remained the same for all tested groups with no

223

sterilization (ANOVA: F4,49=0.99, p=0.42), one sterilization (F4,49=0.98, p=0.43), and five

224

sterilizations (F4,49=1.702, p=0.17). This occurred despite significant differences in the thickness

225

of the different face coverings and masks (ANOVA: F3,41=713, p<0.001; η2=0.98). Cotton face

226

coverings were the thickest (0.367 ± 0.004 mm), followed by masks (0.341 ± 0.008), silk (0.306

227

± 0.005 mm) and then polyester (0.216 ± 0.008 mm).

Discussion
Protective layers and face coverings made from 100% silk, a naturally produced commonly

231

available material, are hydrophobic and can effectively impede the penetration and absorption of

232

both liquid and aerosolized water droplets. The hydrophobicity of silk fabric is further enhanced

233

when used in multiple layers, which when combined, are still thinner than most cotton materials

234

and standard PPE such as surgical masks. Our results demonstrate that the greater

235

hydrophobicity of silk relative to other fabrics, such as cotton and polyester, can make it more

236

effective at impeding droplets, which is a common transmission pathway for the virus that

237

underlies COVID-19 [30].

238

Silk performs similarly to surgical masks when layered over respirators, as they would occur

239

in clinical settings (Fig 1A), yet has the added advantages of greater hydrophobicity and the

240

ability to be easily cleaned through washing for multiple uses. Recent work has also aimed at

241

making synthetic, reusable hydrophobic layers to layer on top of respirators [34]. The use of

242

natural silk barriers to protect PPE adds to these initiatives, but with the added benefits of silk’s

243

inherent beneficial properties and accessibility of silk for both commercial and public use. Here,

244

the sericulture, textile, and garment industries, along with their supply networks and

245

infrastructure, potentially have a direct pathway to becoming important partners against the

246

current COVID-19 pandemic and in future public health emergencies in which PPE may again

247

be in short reserve.

248

A limitation of respirators and masks, but especially face coverings, is that normal breathing

249

can be hampered when worn, and this difficulty increases with thickness. Prolonged use also

250

exposes individuals to added risks, as they increase the local humidity around the area upon

251

which it is worn (>90% relative humidity) [35], thereby creating a potential pathway for the virus

252

to travel due to the trapped moisture near the face that inadvertently increases wetness [5,36].

253

Increased humidity underneath these items, exacerbated when worn in hot and humid

254

environments, significantly decreases their wearability because of higher friction and skin

255

moisture [37]. This creates discomfort and can result in an individual unintentionally touching

256

their face. Our results suggest that this limitation and its accompanying risks can be mitigated by

257

silk, at least when it is used in the fabrication of face coverings.

258

Currently, public health recommendations focus on cotton material for face coverings [14].

259

We found that cotton materials are hydrophilic, and readily allow droplets to rapidly penetrate

260

and saturate the fabric like a sponge. Therefore, face coverings made out of these materials may

261

quickly become reservoirs of virus and act as conduits for viral transmission when worn, even

262

after a short time [5,6]. Face coverings made out of polyester face these same limitations, as it is

263

hydrophilic like cotton. Therefore, cloth and polyester face coverings appear to be more suitable

264

for brief, one-time use. In contrast, silk’s hydrophobicity, increased filtering efficiency when

265

layered [13], and lack of capillary action [20] make it a more advantageous material for face

266

coverings that are also thin, light, and breathable. Recent recommendations by the World Health

267

Organization have also mentioned combining hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers when creating

268

face coverings [38], and our work supports the use of silk as a better hydrophobic layer for face

269

coverings that is more effective than either cotton or polyester material that are hydrophilic.

270

Furthermore, our results also suggest that using multiple layers of silk for face coverings can

271

increase filtering efficiency, yet retain and enhance its advantageous hydrophobic properties that

272

can preclude it from becoming a reservoir and conduit for the virus, while remaining breathable

273

and comfortable when worn.

274

Although N95 respirators are still the most effective form of protection against viral

275

transmission, our study highlights the practicality of using current commercially available 100%

276

silk material as a protective barrier for PPE and as a material for face coverings. Moreover, silk

277

may play a major role in the development of new PPE equipment, such as respirator inserts, that

278

capitalize on its many benefits. For example, silk possesses antimicrobial, antiviral, and

279

antibacterial properties [24,26], potentially due to the presence of copper, a compound that has

280

antiviral properties and which animals naturally incorporate into their silk [23]. Other fabrics and

281

non-specialized PPE require copper particles to be infused during the manufacturing process

282

[39], an expensive process that could be circumvented by using natural silk fibers. In summary,

283

we suggest that silk has untapped potential for use during the current shortage of PPE in the

284

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It can be effective when used as a covering to extend the lifetime

285

of N95 respirators, when fashioned as face coverings for the general public, and as a material for

286

the development of the next generation of PPE.

Materials and fabrics tested
We tested five material groups for contact angle, saturation propensity, and gas exchange
rates, then tested three fabric groups for droplet penetration of single and multiple layers, and for
resistance to aerosolized spray. For animal-derived silk that was natural and unmanipulated, we
took Bombyx mori cocoon samples from our current laboratory colony (3rd generation reared;
Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cincinnati) and Hyalophora cecropia cocoon
samples collected outdoors from Eastern and Central, Massachusetts between 2013-2016 [1]. For
animal-derived processed silk materials, we tested black (unwashed thickness: 0.094 ± 0.002
mm; washed: 0.092 ± 0.003 mm) and white (unwashed thickness: 0.0.112 ± 0.001 mm; washed:
0.103 ± 0.004 mm) 100% silk scarves (Cyzlann, Shenzhen Yirong Technology Co. Ltd.,
Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) and a 100% mulberry silk (unwashed thickness: 0.165 ± 0.001
mm; washed: 0.169 ± 0.003 mm) pillowcase (Ravmix, Shenzhen City, Yuanmi Trade Co., Ltd.,
Guangdong, China). Subsets of the silk material were washed according to instructions outlined
by the distributor to create the silk (washed) group. For processed plant-derived material (100%),
we tested a 100% cotton handkerchief (thickness: 0.158 ± 0.010 mm), 100% cotton fabric
(thickness: 0.199 ± 0.006 mm), and a 100% Egyptian cotton pillowcase (thickness: 0.163 ±
0.005mm). Synthetic materials tested included a pillowcase that was a blend of 88% polyester –
12% nylon (thickness: 0.152 ± 0.002 mm), a 100% polyester pillowcase (thickness: 0.103 ±
0.001 mm), and a 100% polyester drawstring bag (thickness: 0.088 ± 0.005 mm). The 100%

Depot, USA), and a Kimwipe (thickness: 0.073 ± 0.004mm; KimTech, USA). Fabrics used for
face coverings tested in aerosolized spray experiments were made from 100% mulberry silk
material, 100% cotton material, and 100% polyester material. Surgical masks were purchased
from local retail stores (surgical mask type 1: Huizhou Canice Health Material Co. Ltd,
Guangdong Province, China; surgical mask type 2: Jiangsu Nanfang Medical Co. Ltd,
Changzhou, Jiangsu, China).

Water droplet contact angle
Contact angle data for 5 µL and 2 µL water droplet trials were collected using an
experimental setup based on those used in previous work [2]. The droplet volumes were based on
the range of values previously used to test natural materials and fabrics [3,4]. The contact angle
of a water droplet deposited onto the material surface (using the sessile drop technique; see
below) was used to determine the hydrophobicity of the test material based on the angle
produced by the edge of a water droplet contacting the material surface. We vertically deposited
the water droplet (5 or 2 µL) onto the fabric piece using a pipette. We avoided any effects of
kinetic energy on the contact angle formed by the droplet by ensuring the droplet was in contact
with both the pipet tip and the surface of the material swatch prior to final deposition [5]. We
used a high-resolution digital camera (Micro 4/3 Lumix SLR, Panasonic Corporation) to capture
trial images. During all trials, the camera was kept level with the water droplet and test material.
We performed trials on a plastic platform that was positioned horizontally and leveled using a
leveler (Bullseye Surface Level, Empire Level). For each trial, we obtained three mean contact

angle measurements (mean angle of the contact angle of the left and right sides of the droplet as
seen in images): the initial contact angle (time = 0 s, the first image that the pipette tip was
completely out of frame), the dynamic contact angle (mean contact angle, sampled every five
seconds, and averaged at the end of the trial), and the final (defined as the last reliable image in
which the contact angle could be determined or at t = 120s). We tested the contact angle of a 5
µL and 2 µL water droplets separately.
Images were sampled every second for a total duration of two minutes and then uploaded to
ImageJ 1.52a (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) for analysis. The two points of contact were then
identified as the outer most points at which the droplet touched the material surface. A straight
line was then drawn with the angle tool connecting the two points of contact, parallel to the plane
of the material, and the angle line was drawn tangential to the point of contact between the
droplet and the material. This technique was done for both the right and left side of the droplet
and then averaged to obtain the mean contact angle [6]. A contact angle measurement was
determined unreliable if either of the two points of contact or the curvature of the droplet could
not be determined.

Saturation propensity and gas exchange
Saturation propensity was measured as the absorption of a water droplet and was used to test
the permeability of the test material. For each trial, we applied a 2 µL water droplet and waited
1-minute before taking an image of the material to measure the total area that the water droplet
had spread within the material. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. If the water droplet was not
absorbed at the end of 1-minute, we measured the area of the water droplet. The water droplet

was applied using a similar technique as above by ensuring the droplet was in contact with the
material first before depositing the droplet.
We tested the rate of gas exchange for each material by using methods that were modified
from previous studies [7,8]. First, we built an airtight holder for material swatches through
which only water vapor was allowed to evaporate. The apparatus was created from a 0.3 mL
micro reaction vessel with a hole in the rubber seal to keep the vessel airtight. Each micro
reaction vessel was filled with water (300 µL), covered with the material swatch and airtight cap,
and then placed on an electronic balance in the room to obtain the initial weight and to measure
the weight change after a 24-hour period. We recorded the ambient temperature and humidity of
the room for the duration of these tests to correct for the water vapor transfer rate [9].

Single and multi-layer silk water droplet absorption
We determined how increasing the number of layers of silk affects the ability of silk to be an
effective barrier by comparing the ability of a 2 µL water droplet to penetrate one, two, and three
layers of silk fabric for washed and unwashed silk groups. For each trial, we placed a 7.62 cm by
12.70 cm notecard on a Styrofoam mannequin head (Fig. S1a), which covered the nose, mouth,
and upper cheek areas (left and right) while the mannequin head was in a horizontal position
(Fig. S1b). Each trial was completed when the 2 µL droplet was no longer present on the surface
of the silk, either through absorption or evaporation. Images were scanned using a flatbed
scanner (Canon MG2220, Canon, Inc.), then uploaded and processed in ImageJ v1.52a. Blank
index cards (Walmart Inc., AR, USA) were used to identify possible potential discoloration in
the card from the manufacturing process that would create a false positive detection during

image analysis. These were identified as small dark points on the card that differed from
discoloration caused by the droplet.

Standardizing aerosolized spray trials
The velocity of the spray was determined through the relationship of flow rate and velocity
using the following equations for flow rate (m3/s):
𝑄=

𝑣
𝑡

(1)

where Q is the flow rate (m3/s), v is the volume (m3), and t is time (s). The relationship between
flow rate and velocity is as follows:

𝑄 = 𝐴𝑉

(2)

where Q is flow rate (m3/s), A is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (m2), and V is the
velocity (m/s). We solved for velocity by first calculating the flow rate (Q) from equation (1) and
then rearranging equation (2). We recorded each spray using a camera (Logitech HD Pro C920)
and weighed the apparatus before and after each spray. The aerosolized spray had an average
velocity of 0.88 ± 0.04 m/s with each spray containing 0.125 ± 0.05 mL of liquid.
Although a real human cough has an extreme amount of variability in droplet size, cough
plume, and other characteristics [10], our device based on a similar experimental design [11]
represents an extreme case in which a patient openly coughs in close proximity without any
protective barrier.

We compared 100% cotton, polyester, and 100% silk (washed and unwashed) as a single
layer and double layer in the aerosolized spray test. We modified an aerosol can with a standard
valve, and added 150 ml of black-dyed water (10ml black dye, 140ml water; McCormick, MD,
USA). Prior to each trial, the aerosol can was filled to 82 kPa with an air pump and checked
using a tire-pressure gauge. The Styrofoam mannequin head had a piece of fabric on top of a
notecard pinned to the face (Fig. S1a), and which was placed 0.66m [10] from the aerosol can
(Fig. S2). A control group (no mask) was sprayed to provide a baseline of discoloration for
comparison. The aerosolized droplets were of a random distribution in size with the speed and
total volume consistent across trials.

Face covering and mask aerosolized spray test
Face coverings were made according to the CDC guidelines for sewn pleated face coverings
[12], and were made with a single material that consisted of either polyester, cotton, or silk (see
above). We made three face coverings for each material group and included two brands of
surgical masks for comparison in the aerosolized spray test. Initially, these coverings were tested
prior to any sterilization and stretching. After the initial trials, the coverings were sterilized using
dry heat (70 °C) for 1-hour each and then retested after a single sterilization and after five
sterilizations. After each sterilization, face coverings were worn for approximately 5-minutes and
stretched (i.e., diagonally, horizontally, and vertically) to simulate wear-and-tear, and the same
masks were used across all trials.
Images were processed in ImageJ 1.52a. The images were converted into 16-bit images to
allow grayscale thresholding to isolate and separate pixels darkened by the aerosolizing
apparatus. Using a positive control, the threshold value was determined by incrementally

increasing the value until both visible spots were sufficiently covered and before there was
significant threshold identification on either the white of the card or on the background on which
the cards were placed. From this process, we were able to obtain an area and associated identity
for every contiguous threshold particle. This tool enabled us to exclude any particles that were
obviously not droplets from the aerosolizing apparatus and instead resulted from the
experimentation itself. These included (1) holes created by the pins securing the card to the
fabric, (2) large shadowed portions of the card created by unintentional bending or creasing of
the card during experimentation, and (3) large fabric remnants or other debris found on the card.
After these areas were excluded, the total sum area of all the threshold particles was calculated.
