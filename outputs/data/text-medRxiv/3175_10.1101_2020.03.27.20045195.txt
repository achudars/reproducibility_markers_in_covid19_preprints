ABSTRACT
The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of
March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of
COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number
of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals.
However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive
number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission
dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the
general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare
workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery
workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and
the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the
frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may
flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may
eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19
transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance
of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home
message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or
should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.

INTRODUCTION
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a major global health threat. Several
control measures are being done to minimize the spread of this contagious disease such as social
distancing, case isolation, household quarantine, and school and university closure [Ferguson,
et. al 2020]. Following China’s containment efforts, several countries adopted broad community
quarantines or lockdowns as a means of controlling the spread of COVID-19 [Anderson, 2020
and Cohen and Kupferschmidt 2020]. However, amidst community quarantines and lockdowns,
there are working classes who continue to provide essential services for healthcare, medicine,
security, food, retail, and transport. This group of workers became collectively referred to as the
“frontliners”. The nature of their work being in close proximity and in frequent interaction with the
public puts them at a higher risk of getting infected [Kiersz 2020 and Gamio 2020], and once
infected, their continuous contact with the public can make them superspreaders. This led to the
implementation of more stringent precautionary measures for frontliners especially to those
working in healthcare.
In models of the spread of COVID-19, the key parameters are the basic reproduction
number which refers to the average number of secondary cases generated from a contagious
person, and a dispersion parameter that can provide further information about outbreak dynamics
and potential for superspreading events [Riou and Althaus 2020]. It is estimated that the basic
reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4 [Rabajante 2020]. Parameters in models of
disease spread are usually considered constant for the entire population with time-variation [Liu,
et.al. 2020]. However, these parameters vary considering the heterogeneity of the population,
location of virus transmission, and socio-economic and political factors [Rabajante, 2020].
In this study, we formulate a mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume different basic reproductive
numbers for the frontliners and the general public. We also consider a parameter for the
susceptibility (which can be decreased through some level of protection) of an exposed individual
with varying values for the frontliners and the general public. We examine the model simulations
and perform sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters are influential to the model output.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL
We consider an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Compartment
Model to study the dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19 (Figure 1). The model has two
mutually exclusive populations: the general public and the frontliners. Frontliners refer to working
classes that provide continued services during disease outbreaks such as healthcare workers,
customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers.
In the model, the general public and the frontliners are compartmentalized to Susceptible,
Exposed, Infected and Recovered. The numbers of susceptible public individuals and frontliners
are 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 , respectively. The numbers of individuals exposed to the disease are 𝐸1 for the
general public and 𝐸2 for the frontliners. For the number of infected, 𝐼1 is for the general public
and 𝐼2 is for the frontliners. From the infected, those that are in isolation are denoted by 𝐼𝑠1 for the
general public and 𝐼𝑠2 for the frontliners. The numbers of recovered public individuals and
frontliners are 𝑅1 and 𝑅2 , respectively.
The general public and the frontliners are assigned different parameter values for basic
reproduction number and susceptibility depending on the exposure to the disease. We refer to 𝛽1
and 𝛽2 as exposure rates for the general public and for the frontliners. The exposure rate is the
number of new exposed individuals caused by an infectious individual per unit time. The rate at
which an exposed public individual and an exposed frontliner become vulnerable or susceptible
to the transmission of the virus is given by 1 − 𝜇1 and 1 − 𝜇2 , respectively. Exposed individuals
become infected with the disease at a rate of 𝛼1 for the general public and 𝛼2 for the frontliners.
Moreover, an infected public individual is being isolated in a health facility at a rate of 𝑖𝑠𝑜1 while
an infected frontliner is being isolated at a rate of 𝑖𝑠𝑜2 . The rate of imported cases of infection is
𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡1 for a public individual and 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡2 for a frontliner. Without isolation, an infected public
individual dies at a rate of 𝑚1 while an infected frontliner dies at a rate of 𝑚2 . However, an infected
public individual in isolation dies at a rate 𝑚𝐼𝑠1 while for the frontliner, the rate is given by 𝑚𝐼𝑠2 .
Without isolation, the rate of recovery is 𝛾1 for an infected public individual and 𝛾2 for an infected
frontliner. On the other hand, in isolation, a public individual recovers at a rate of 𝛾1 ∗ and a
frontliner recovers at a rate of 𝛾2 ∗ . Individuals who recovered from the disease become
susceptible again at a rate of 𝜌1 for the general public and 𝜌2 for the frontliners.
The dynamics in the extended SEIR Compartment Model we used in the study is
described by the following equations.

SIMULATION RESULTS
For the simulation, we use parameter values indicated in Table 1. We run a simulation of
the model for 200 days starting from the onset of the spread of the disease with initial values for
population sizes indicated in Table 2. We vary parameter values for basic reproduction number
and susceptibility (vulnerability) rate, and observe the number of infected individuals in isolation
and not in isolation for both the frontliners and the general public. The following are our
observations.
The parameters 𝜇𝟏 and 𝜇𝟐 quantify the protection of the general public and the frontliners
when they are exposed to the disease. Higher values for 𝜇 may mean that preventive measures
(e.g. social distancing, use of protective gears and self-sanitizing) are effective against infection.
We vary the values for 𝜇𝟏 and 𝜇𝟐 and observe how these affect the dynamics of the infection
through the general public and the frontliners.
First, we increase the protection 𝜇𝟏 of the general public, for a fixed value of 𝜇𝟐 . We
obtained the following insights: (i) as 𝜇1 increases, there is a flattening in the peak of the number
of infected for both populations (Figs. 2a-d), which means increasing the protection of the general

public causes a significant decrease in the number of infected individuals; and (ii) as 𝜇1 increases,
the peak of the number of infected for both populations happens at a later time (Figs. 2), which
implies the increase in the number of infected individuals is slowed down.

Second, we significantly change the initial values of the compartments S,E, and I but with
varying values of both 𝜇𝟏 and 𝜇𝟐 (Fig. 3). We observed that peaks are reached after almost the
same number of days regardless of the initial population size.
Third, we increase the protection 𝜇𝟐 of the frontliners, for a fixed value of 𝜇𝟏 . The number
of infected frontliners decreased but there is no significant effect on the number of infected public
individuals (Fig. 4). Moreover, when the initial population of frontliners increased ten times, the
peak on the number of infected public individuals significantly increased by 43.48% of the total
number of susceptible public individuals. When we increase the protection of the frontliners, we
observe a decrease in the number of infected public individuals. We also found that decreasing
the average secondary infections produced by an infectious public individual (𝑅01 ) will
considerably reduce the infected population of both the general public and the frontliners (Fig.5a).
Figure 5b shows that the most effective way to minimize the number of infected individuals is a
combination of reduced reproductive number (𝑅01 ) and an improved protection for the general
public. Moreover, when the average number of secondary cases generated from a contagious
public individual and a contagious frontliner is 1.5 and 2.5, respectively (i.e., 𝑅01 = 1.5 and 𝑅02 =
2.5), there is only a small chance that the general public will infect the frontliners (Fig. 5), thus
protecting the frontliners. This agrees with the measures currently being implemented that the
general public should practice social distancing and be protected.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Sensitivity analysis is a method used to identify the effect of each parameter in the model
outcome. Its aim is to identify the parameters that most influence the model output and quantify
how uncertainty in the input affects model outputs [Marino et al., 2008]. In this study, we are
interested in the number of infected individuals of both the general public 𝐼1 and the frontliners 𝐼2 .
We employed a method called partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) analysis, which is a
global sensitivity analysis technique that is proven to be the most reliable and efficient samplingbased method. To implement PRCC analysis, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is used in
obtaining input parameter values. This is a stratified sampling without replacement technique

proposed by Mckay et al. [Marino et al., 2008]. Here, the uniform distribution is assigned to every
parameter and simulation is done 10,000 times. The maximum and minimum values of the
parameters are set as ±90% of the default values listed in Table 1 with values of 𝜇1 and 𝜇2 set to
0.1.

PRCC values which range from -1 to 1 are computed in different time points, specifically
in the years t=40k, k=0,1…,5 using the MATLAB function partialcorr. In Figure 6, each bar
corresponds to a PRCC value at an instance. The value of 1 takes a perfect positive linear
relationship while -1 means a perfect negative linear relationship, and a large absolute PRCC
value would mean a large correlation of the parameter with the model outcome, that is, a minute
change to a sensitive parameter would affect the dynamics of the model output. Parameters 𝑅01 ,
𝜏, 𝛼1 , 𝛾1 , and 𝑅02 are found to have high PRCC values (>0.5 or <-0.5). Among these, 𝑅01 , 𝛼1 ,
and 𝑅02 have positive PRCC values which mean that an increase in the values of these
parameters will result in an increase in the infected population size. In contrast, 𝜏 and 𝛾1 have
negative PRCC values which indicate that increasing their values will consequently decrease the
infected population.

DISCUSSION

We investigated the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between frontliners and the
general public using an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Compartment
Model. The model has two mutually exclusive populations: the general public and the frontliners.
Since frontliners have frequent interaction with the population, we assume a basic reproduction
number higher than that of the general public. Sensitivity of the model parameters is determined
to evaluate those with significant impact on the model output, in this case, the infected population
of both the general public and frontliners. It was observed that the infected population is sensitive
to the changes in the basic reproduction numbers of the general public 𝑅01 and of the frontliners
𝑅02 , the infection period 𝜏, the infection rate of an exposed public individual 𝛼1 , and the recovery
rate of a non-isolated infected public individual 𝛾1 .
The model cannot be immediately utilized to make predictions on the spread of COVID19 but it provides us insights on the transmission of a disease between two populations with
different characteristics in terms of factors affecting the spread of a disease, such as the basic
reproduction number and susceptibility rate. This can help in developing sound decisions and

effective strategies in mitigating the spread of a disease. Simulations of the model show that both
the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against a spreading disease.
Prioritizing only the protection of the frontliners cannot flatten the epidemic curve. On the other
hand, protecting only the general public from the disease will significantly flatten the epidemic
curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which can eventually affect their
capability to provide services during an epidemic. In addition, if the control measures for the public
are less strict, we can expect that the number of secondary cases to be higher on the average.
