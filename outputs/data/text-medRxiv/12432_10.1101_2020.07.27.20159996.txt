Abstract
Timely interventions and early preparedness of healthcare resources
are crucial measures to tackle the COVID-19 disease. To aid these
efforts, we developed the Mobility-Augmented SEIR model (MA-SEIR)
that leverages Google‚Äôs aggregate and anonymized mobility data to
augment classic compartmental models. We show in a retrospective
analysis how this method can be applied at an early stage in the
COVID-19 epidemic to forecast its subsequent spread and onset in
different geographic regions, with minimal parameterization of the
model. This provides insight into the role of near real-time aggregate
mobility data in disease spread modeling by quantifying substantial
changes in how populations move both locally and globally. These
changes would be otherwise very hard to capture using less timely data.

Introduction
Following its initial spread in China, COVID-19 has quickly swept across many
countries and developed into a global pandemic. As of July 14, 2020, there
have been 12,964,809 confirmed cases globally, including 570,288 deaths [1].
This crisis has also brought serious challenges to many healthcare systems.
Since the outbreak, many countries have been suffering from a shortage of
healthcare professionals, personal protective equipment and other medical
resources. Early warnings of a potential pandemic, including understanding
where the disease will spread next, may inform resource allocation and
early interventions by governments and public health organizations aimed at
containment.
Human mobility data has played an important role in infectious disease
modeling. Classic models such as the gravity model [2] and radiation model
[3] have been developed to model human movement in disease spreading.
Colizza et al. developed metapopulation models based on reaction-diffusion
theories characterized by heterogeneous connectivity and mobility patterns
[4]. Balcan et al. integrated short- and long-term mobility flows to model
spatiotemporal patterns of a global epidemic [5, 6]. Mobility-based models
have been successfully applied to diseases such as influenza [5], malaria [7,
8], measles [9], HIV [10] and SARS [11]. Similarly, human mobility data
has already played a critical role in modeling COVID-19. For instance,
Kraemer et al. analyzed the effect of human mobility and control measures
on the COVID-19 epidemic in China [12]. Mobility data derived from air,
road and rail traffic as well as social media were used to model the early
outbreak of COVID-19 in China [13, 14] and early global spread [15]. More
recently, Pei et al. developed a metapopulation model at county level in
the United States and that employs two types of mobility flows, daily work
commuting and random movement, to model the spread of COVID-19 [16].
In this paper, we present the Mobility-Augmented SEIR (MA-SEIR)
model, an approach that is based on a variant of compartmental models [17,
18] and takes into account aggregate mobility data to predict COVID-19
spread across countries and states. In contrast to mobility data based on
traffic networks or social media, Google‚Äôs aggregate and anonymized mobility

data is derived from Google users who have turned on the Location History
setting, which is off by default [19]. This is similar to the data used to show
how busy certain types of places are in Google Maps ‚Äî helping identify when
a local business tends to be the most crowded. With this up-to-date mobility
dataset, we show how the MA-SEIR model is able to forecast the onset of the
COVID-19 epidemic at both global and local geographical levels, where the
onset is defined as the time when the number of cases is above 100 at country
level and 30 at US state level. We also illustrate its use to estimate the effect
of reduced or increased mobility on COVID-19 spread by simulating different
mobility scenarios. In the following sections we present retrospective analyses
to test these claims.

Results
MA-SEIR predicts the onset of the global pandemic
The MA-SEIR parameters are estimated from the reported cases in China [14]
(details in Supplementary Information). Since we aim to model how a novel
infectious disease spreads across the globe, we assume good knowledge on parameterization is not available at the early stage of an epidemic. Nevertheless,
we assume that a simple MA-SEIR model with time-independent parameters
can capture the early stage of the epidemic reasonably well. When augmented
with near real-time mobility data, we hypothesize that the MA-SEIR model
can simulate the spread of COVID-19 and predict the onset of the epidemic
in new geographic areas with minimal initial seeding and parameterization.
We assumed that COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan, China, thus
the disease spread is simulated by seeding positive cases in China [20]. We
experimented with a few seeding strategies, including seeding China with
the earliest confirmed case, seeding cases in China and South Korea, and in
China and Italy. We found that using the earliest confirmed case to seed the
simulations yielded the best results in terms of interpretability and forecasting
accuracy. This is likely due to the fact that different regions had inconsistent
testing capacities early in the epidemic, and therefore seeding with confirmed
cases from different regions may not accurately represent the earliest stage
of the pandemic. Based on this analysis, we seeded all global simulations of
country-level COVID-19 spread with only the first confirmed case in China
on December 1, 2019, according to [20]. The simulations were run from
December 1 to May 1, 2020, with real-time mobility flows up to January 30,
2020.
Figure 2 shows the performance of MA-SEIR in predicting the epidemic
onset for a number of countries across the world. The countries shown in
the figure are from six continents, including Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania,
North America, and South America. Countries below the dotted line show
early predictions compared to the actual confirmed onset dates. We also note
that, due to varying COVID-19 testing and reporting situations across the
countries, the reported onset dates may be inaccurate with delays. Therefore,
our prediction offers an alternative estimate of the actual epidemic across the

of predicting the epidemic onset in advance for most countries, as shown

model performance on predicting the onset days are presented in Table 1.
For countries with early onset predictions and late onset predictions, the
corresponding mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 21.8 days and 18.8 days,
respectively. Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual
onset days is 0.51. Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation between the predicted and
actual onsets is 0.67, suggesting a good positive correlation in predicting
country onset in a relative manner.

MA-SEIR predicts regional epidemic outbreaks
We then tested the hypothesis whether MA-SEIR can forecast the onset
of COVID-19 in each US state in a retrospective analysis. We seeded the
simulation using 13 imported cases prior to February 14, 2020 (Table S1), and
modeled the epidemics with aggregate and anonymized inter-state mobility
flows. The simulations were run from January 23 to May 1, 2020, with
real-time mobility flows up to February 14, 2020.
Figure 5 compares predicted and actual onset dates of the COVID-19
epidemic in each US state. The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients
between the predicted onset and the actual date are 0.61 and 0.44, respectively.
Overall, the MA-SEIR model predicted the onset of COVID-19 epidemic with
good accuracy (MAE: 11.9 days). Among the 50 states, 35 states (shown in
green in Figure 5) exhibit less than two weeks of delay in predicted onset time
(MAE: 9.31 days). Thirteen states (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania,
South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming) exhibit delays between 2-3

weeks (shown in orange in Figure 5). Two states, Delaware and West Virginia,
show significantly delayed onset (28 days for Delaware and 24 days for West
Virginia). We next divided all the states into two groups based on whether
the predicted onset is earlier or later than the reported onset, and computed
the same metrics for each group. The MAEs are 13.4 days for the early
prediction group and 11.5 days for the late prediction group. These results
suggest that the MA-SEIR model is capable of forecasting the onset of local
COVID-19 outbreak with reasonable accuracy, even though in some states
the predicted onset date is delayed (Table S2).

MA-SEIR provides insights into mobility flows and disease
spread
Here, we aimed to understand the relationship between the change of mobility
and disease spread. We first analyzed the change of global mobility in response
to COVID-19 outbreak. Starting from January 23, 2020, China has imposed
strict lockdown measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread. Since then, many
countries have adopted travel restrictions. As illustrated in Figure 6, the
mobility flows in March 2020 have decreased substantially compared to that
in January 2019 for the selected countries, especially countries in Asia and
Europe. Italy experienced the strongest reduction among European countries.
On average, the March mobility flows have dropped by 45.1% w.r.t. January
2020 and April mobility flows have dropped by 82.1%. These analyses suggest
that travel restrictions have strongly suppressed the inter-country mobility.
To further understand how the change of inter-country mobility affects
COVID-19 epidemic onset, we simulated the COVID-19 spread with reduced
mobility flows. The simulated reduction occurred on December 21, 2019, that
is, 20 days after the first seed in China.
We compared the predicted epidemic onset time using regular mobility
flow versus using various levels of reductions in the flow, to evaluate the effects.
We found that the mobility reduction indeed delayed the predicted epidemic
onset time, as shown in Figure 7. The stronger the mobility reduction, the
more the onset days were delayed. For countries, such as Spain, United
Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, etc., the delay can be more significant under
85% mobility reductions. For Argentina, Brazil, etc., the delays don‚Äôt change

with varying mobility reductions. We also selected the 130 countries that have
seen epidemic onsets according to reported confirmed cases, and computed
the average delays in the predicted onset days with different levels of mobility
reductions. These analyses suggest that the effects of mobility reductions
can be modeled by MA-SEIR and global mobility flows. While reduction of
inter-country mobility can delay the onset of an epidemic, these effects are
only significant with substantial reductions and vary by country.

Discussion
In this work, we augmented a well-established infectious disease model with
Google‚Äôs aggregate and anonymized mobility data, and demonstrated its
application to forecasting the onset of COVID-19 outbreak in a retrospective
analysis. Our results suggest that the MA-SEIR model may be used to
advise governments or public health organizations for a potential epidemic. It
may also play a role in informing a secondary wave of a pandemic, provided
corresponding parameters can be estimated. While the dynamics of each patch
in the model is based on a simple well-mixed SEIR scheme, the integration of
general human movement flows enables infectious disease modeling at a large
spatio-temporal scale. This is seen manifested by the global COVID-19 onset
forecasting with the first infection case in early December 2019. Additionally,
we demonstrated that using the MA-SEIR model to simulate epidemic onset
with different levels of mobility reduction offers a framework to understand
the relationship between human movement and COVID-19 spread.
It‚Äôs worth noting the assumptions in our approach. First, the SEIR
model assumes the latent population (‚ÄúExposed‚Äù) is infectious and that this
population will eventually convert to ‚ÄúInfectious‚Äù state. Recent studies suggest

that for COVID-19 there exists a large undocumented infected population [21]
and among them many could be asymptomatic [22]. These findings suggest
additional compartments capturing asymptomatic and untested cases may
improve the model. Secondly, we assume that the size of each compartmental
state in the mobility flow is proportional to the same state in the total
population of a patch. This assumption may only hold at the early stage
of an epidemic. As quarantines and other measures will likely take place
during the progression of the epidemic, the infectious sub-population in the
mobility flow will be reduced compared to other sub-populations. Thirdly,
our approach requires disease-specific model parameters. In order to provide
early warnings, these parameters need to be estimated using early disease
transmission information. In our work, the parameters are from [14] where the
authors use case numbers in Hubei Province, China from January 16, 2020 to
January 25, 2020 to estimate model parameters. Finally, in our retrospective
analysis, we use confirmed cases to determine the onset of COVID-19. It‚Äôs
likely the actual onset is significantly earlier due to undocumented cases
and the lag of testing. Therefore, in a real forecasting situation, a further
calibration of the predicted onset is required in order to account for these
effects.
For our regional simulations, the states with less accurate forecasting
results tend to be those that have later epidemic onset. Therefore, one
possible approach to improving the forecasting performance is to continuously
seed the simulations using confirmed imported cases along with near realtime mobility data as the epidemic progresses. This approach will also likely
improve the forecasting performance for New York state, which in our current
simulation has no explicit seeding of infection cases. Instead, the infection
in New York state is purely seeded by domestic mobility. Recent studies
suggest that infection from abroad might have happened in New York state
[23]. Therefore explicit seeding of imported cases in New York state is likely
to improve its onset prediction.
While the methodology presented in this work is able to forecast epidemic
onset with reasonable accuracy, forecasting the magnitude and duration of
an epidemic is more challenging and heavily influenced by public health and
disease control actions. Further work is required to model the spread of

COVID-19 in response to interventions such as social distancing and contact
tracing. We speculate that Google‚Äôs aggregate and anonymized mobility data
can be integrated to more detailed modeling techniques such as stochastic
meta-population models and agent-based models, in order to model the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Model details
The MA-SEIR metapopulation model is based on earlier SEIR models designed and validated for COVID-19 [13, 14]. In this model we consider each
geographic location as a metapopulation. Aggregated anonymized mobility
data reported to Google was used to compute the flows between the metapopulations. Unlike classic compartmental models, our approach considers the
dynamics of the two following components: (1) the intrinsic dynamics within
each metapopulation, and (2) the dynamics due to the flows brought by
general human movement.
The SEIR model is often expressed as a continuous-time dynamic system
governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Here, we formulate the
system as discrete-time Markov process in order to make it compatible with
our mobility data, which is indexed by discrete time points:

indicates the mobility flow per unit time from location i to location j at time
t. The parameters Œ≤1 and Œ≤2 are the transmission rates from the Infected and
the Exposed, respectively. The parameters œÉ and Œ≥ are the incubation rate (the
reciprocal of incubation period) and the recovery rate (the reciprocal of infection
period). Additionally, our model includes a time-dependent multiplier factor r(t)
that is intended for modeling the change of transmission rates over time.
Extensive work has been done in order to estimate the epidemiological parameters
for COVID-19 [14, 24‚Äì30]. In our retrospective analysis, however we decided to
minimize parameter fitting for the following reasons: (1) for a real forecasting task
(rather than retrospective analysis) it is unlikely to fit high-quality parameters at the
very early stage of an epidemic when reported case numbers are sparse and noisy;
and (2) we focused on forecasting the onset of the outbreak, rather than the peak
time. Therefore in this work we used a well-established set of parameters that are
derived from epidemiological data in Wuhan China in January 2020 [14]. The only
fitted parameter in this work is the multiplier factor r(t), whose value is determined
by fitting the early epidemic curves in Italy and South Korea. A single constant
r(t) value is used throughout this work. This is reasonable since at the onset of an
epidemiological event, social behavior remains constant until identification. The
corresponding basic reproduction number R0 is 2.99 with corresponding r(t) value.
Table 3 summarizes the parameters of the MA-SEIR model in this work.
The ODE solver ‚Äúodeint‚Äù in SciPy [31] was used to solve this system. We derived
the initial conditions for each location using mobility data. Seeding was done by
further setting Infected size to the number of seeded infections in corresponding
locations.

Mobility data
The Google COVID-19 Aggregated Mobility Research Dataset used for this study
is available with permission from Google LLC. This Dataset contains anonymized
relative mobility flows aggregated over users who have turned on the Location
History setting [19], which is off by default. This is similar to the data used to show
how busy certain types of places are in Google Maps ‚Äî helping identify when a
local business tends to be the most crowded. The dataset aggregates flows of people
from region to region weekly.
To produce this dataset, machine learning is applied to logs data to automatically
segment it into semantic trips [32]. To provide strong privacy guarantees, all trips
were anonymized and aggregated using a differentially private mechanism [33, 34]
to aggregate flows over time (see [35]). This research is done on the resulting
heavily aggregated and differentially private data. No individual user data was
ever manually inspected, only heavily aggregated flows of large populations were
handled.
All anonymized trips are processed in aggregate to extract their origin and
destination location and time. For example, if n users traveled from location a
to location b within time interval t, the corresponding cell (a, b, t) in the tensor
would be n ¬± err, where err is Laplacian noise. The automated Laplace mechanism
adds random noise drawn from a zero mean Laplace distribution and yields (, Œ¥)differential privacy guarantee of  = 0.66 and Œ¥ = 2.1 √ó 10‚àí29 . The parameter 
controls the noise intensity in terms of its variance, while Œ¥ represents the deviation
from pure -privacy. The closer they are to zero, the stronger the privacy guarantees.
These results should be interpreted in light of several important limitations.
First, the Google mobility data is limited to smartphone users who have opted in to
Google‚Äôs Location History feature, which is off by default. These data may not be
representative of the population as whole, and furthermore their representativeness
may vary by location. Importantly, these limited data are only viewed through the
lens of differential privacy algorithms, specifically designed to protect user anonymity
and obscure fine detail. Moreover, comparisons across rather than within locations
are only descriptive since these regions can differ in substantial ways.
In our work and in relation to the dataset described above, the ‚Äúlocation‚Äù can be
a country, state, or county. The ‚Äúflow‚Äù represents the number of users from source to
destination locations at the same granularity. The temporal bucket is weekly. Our
mobility data doesn‚Äôt have sufficient data coverage in China. According to published
data, in 2018 Hong Kong has one of the busiest airports in terms of international
passenger traffic (74 million) [36], whereas the international passenger traffic volume
of Mainland China in 2018 is estimated to be 64 million [37]. We therefore use

the mobility data in Hong Kong to approximate the mobility flow originated from
China. Regardless of the granularity, all mobility data are protected by the privacy
policies described above.

COVID-19 dataset
Country-level COVID-19 case numbers are obtained from NSSAC (Network Systems
Science and Advanced Computing) daily case reports from the University of Virginia
[38]. US county-level COVID-19 confirmed case numbers are downloaded from the
New York Times [39].

Experiments
Three experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed
MA-SEIR approach and understand the effects mobility in the spread of COVID-19.
We assume that the mobility data beyond the date when the simulation is performed
is unknown and can only be estimated.
1. Global country-level modeling of COVID-19 spread is assumed to be performed
on January 30 2019 to forecast the epidemic onset, with seeds from reported
confirmed cases before this date. The simulation starting date is on December
1st 2019. Therefore the mobility flows used in the simulation includes real-time
mobility data for December 2019, January 2020, and approximated mobility
for year 2020 (using data from February to May 2019).
2. State-level modeling of COVID-19 spread for United States is assumed to be
performed on February 14, 2020, with seeds from reported confirmed cases
before this date. The start date of the mobility data is the same as the
first date of the simulations. In order to simulate real forecasting scenario,
mobility data beyond the date of last seeding infection (February 14, 2020)
was replaced by the average mobility data prior to that date.
3. Different levels of simulated reduction of mobility are then incorporated into
the MA-SEIR model to evaluate their effects in epidemic onsets. The onset
dates derived from these simulations with various degrees of mobility reduction
are compared.
An epidemic onset is technically defined as the time when the number of cases is
above what is normally expected (‚Äúepidemic threshold‚Äù) [40]. Different approaches of
calculating the epidemic threshold have been proposed [41]. For SARS-CoV-2, there
is no consensus epidemic threshold yet. In this work, a subjective fixed epidemic

threshold is defined in order to quantify the model performance. We use 100 and
30 cumulative confirmed cases as the epidemic thresholds for countries and states,
respectively. To evaluate the model forecasting accuracy, we compute the mean and
median of absolute errors in the actual and predicted onset days. We also summarize
the positive (early prediction) and negative (late prediction) error individually.

MA-SEIR parameterization
To evaluate whether the parameters estimated from China can simulate epidemics
in other regions, we run simulations about COVID-19 epidemics at fine spatial
resolution at US county level. As shown in Figure S1, the resulting curves initially
match the confirmed cases. However, as the epidemic develops, the curves start
to deviate from the reported case numbers. Two main reasons may contribute to
this discrepancy. First, a substantial number of cases were undocumented due to
insufficient testing capacity at the beginning of the epidemic [21]. Secondly, control
measures implemented at different stages of the epidemic may have led to decreasing
transmission rates. We further simulated the epidemics under different scenarios
by adjusting the time-dependent multiplier factor r(t), in order to approximate the
decrease of the transmission rates. Figure S1 shows the resulting curves along with
confirmed cases in three counties: King County, WA, Santa Clara County, CA, and
New York, NY. Indeed, simulations with time-dependent transmission rates produce
epidemic curves that more closely match reported positive cases.
Figure S1 shows that time-dependent model parameters are necessary to model
the epidemic at longer time scales. However, this is difficult to do early in a new
epidemic because it is not clear when control measures will be instituted and what
effect they will have on slowing transmission. Additionally, it is complicated by the
fact that the number of actual cases is sparse and inconsistently reported, especially
early in the epidemic. Nevertheless, we see that a simple MA-SEIR model with
time-independent parameters can capture the early stage of the epidemic reasonably
well. When augmented with near real-time mobility data, we hypothesize that the
MA-SEIR model can predict the onset of the epidemic in new geographic areas with
minimal initial seeding and parameterization. Therefore, this set of parameters are
used throughout the simulations at both global country and US state level.

Figure S1: Simulated epidemic curves by MA-SEIR for King County, WA,
Santa Clara County, CA and New York City, NY. Each location contains 6
different transmission rate reduction scenarios. The early epidemic curves
are well captured by the initial values of the time-dependent parameters in
MA-SEIR.
