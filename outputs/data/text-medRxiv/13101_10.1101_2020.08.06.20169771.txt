Key Points
Question. Are CRISPR-based methods a reliable and accessible option to capture SARS-CoV2 outbreaks in a college population?
Findings. We tested 1,808 asymptomatic individuals from a university population for SARS-CoV2, using, for the first time, a CRISPR-based assay for virus surveillance. We detected eight
positive cases, corroborated by RT-qPCR and confirmed by a clinical laboratory. Our CRISPRbased method captured a change in viral prevalence coinciding with the relaxation of lockdown
measures and the rise of COVID-19 cases in the community.
Significance. We demonstrate that CRISPR-based methods offer scalable and reliable SARSCoV-2 testing for virus surveillance and allow capturing the leading edge of an outbreak.
Abstract
Importance: The re-opening of colleges and universities through the US during the COVID-19
pandemic is a significant public health challenge. The development of accessible and practical
approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection in the college population is paramount for deploying
recurrent surveillance testing as an essential strategy for virus detection, containment, and
mitigation.
Objectives: In this study, we set out to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in
asymptomatic subjects in a university community, using, for the first time, CREST, a CRISPRCas13-based test that we developed for accessible and large scale viral surveillance1.
Study Design, Setting, and Participants: We enrolled 1,808 asymptomatic persons to undergo
SARS-CoV-2 testing. We compared viral prevalence in self-collected oropharyngeal swab
samples obtained in two time periods: May 28th-June 11th and June 23rd-July 2nd, 2020. We
detected viral genomes in these samples using CREST, and we corroborated our results with a
point-of-reference RT-qPCR test. Positive samples were confirmed by a clinical laboratory and
reported to the local Public Health Department.
Results: All the 732 tests performed between late May to early June were negative. In contrast,
tests performed on 1,076 samples collected between late June to early July revealed eight
positive cases by CREST, confirmed by RT-qPCR and CLIA-diagnostic testing. The average age

of the positive cases was 21.7 years; all individuals self-identified as students. These metrics
showed that CREST was effective at capturing positive SARS-CoV-2 cases in our student
population. Notably, the viral loads detected in these asymptomatic cases resemble those seen
in clinical samples, highlighting the potential of covert viral transmission.
Conclusions and Relevance: Our study revealed a substantial shift in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence
in a young and asymptomatic population, and uncovered the leading wave of a local outbreak
that coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California.
Moreover, and most notably, the almost perfect concordance between CRISPR- and PCR-based
testing indicated that CREST using self-collected OP swabs is reliable and it allows expanding
options for large-scale surveillance testing and detection of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, as is
required to resume operations in higher education institutions in the US and abroad.
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and has disrupted the way
of life of countless communities. To control this pandemic, communities worldwide closed
businesses, prohibited large social gatherings, and adopted non-pharmacological intervention
(NPI) measures2–4. Initial restrictions were successful in several countries where COVID-19
cases, hospitalizations, and deaths declined3,4. However, as communities relaxed social
distancing and restrictions, COVID-19 cases returned, often following exponential growth. Several
metrics, including percent positivity of testing, hospitalizations, and death rates, have been used
to gain insights into epidemic trends in specific populations. Prevalence among asymptomatic
persons is an important but more elusive metric, primarily because of test scarcity and
prioritization of symptomatic patients or contacts with confirmed cases. Nevertheless,
understanding both asymptomatic prevalence and the impact of NPI measures on infection rates
has tremendous potential to inform vital public health decisions.
A fundamental aspect of pandemic control is careful planning for the re-opening of college
campuses. While COVID-19 testing has focused on individuals with increased risk of infection
and mortality, an increasing disease burden has emerged in those aged 19-30, many of whom
attend college and university5. Every year since 2017, over 15 million students attend colleges in
the US6. Many students reside in dormitories and off-campus housing, frequently in crowded
conditions, sharing restrooms, kitchens, and common areas7. These living conditions are
associated with high morbidities of diseases like meningococcal meningitis, influenza, mumps,
and measles8–11. Respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 are easily transmitted among
individuals living in college dormitories and during social contact by exposure to live virus in
aerosol droplets12–14.
Further complicating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in university settings is the well-documented
infectivity of asymptomatic persons, many of whom are likely to be pre-symptomatic with high
viral loads15–21. Those without symptoms are likely to be responsible for as many as 44% of new
infections22. Recent examples of colleges re-opening and promptly closing, or those that
implemented drastic quarantine measures for their students following the detection of COVID-19
outbreaks, illustrate the challenges of safely bringing academic activities back to campus during
a pandemic. The upsurge of cases within college populations also presents a risk beyond campus
walls, as infections can spill over to neighboring communities23. The early identification of infected
individuals through expanded and frequent surveillance testing is essential to curb disease
spread. However, before undertaking such large-scale surveillance testing, the prevalence of
asymptomatic infection must be ascertained to inform decisions regarding the utility of expanded
testing in a university population24.

To understand viral prevalence in the university community, and to assess the potential of a
CRISPR-based test to screen for SARS-CoV2 in asymptomatic persons, we enrolled healthy
volunteers from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in a virus surveillance study.
We obtained self-collected oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples, which we processed for SARSCoV-2 testing using two methods; CREST, our newly-developed CRISPR-Cas13-based assay1,
and the CDC-recommended RT-qPCR assay25, which we used as a point-of-reference test. We
compared the results obtained from two time periods. The first collection period occurred during
May-June, 2020, approximately two months into a state-wide stay-at-home mandate. The second
collection period occurred during late June-early July 2020, approximately three weeks after local
restrictions for isolation were relaxed in the community. Our results revealed no COVID-19 cases
in our study population in May-June of 2020. Using the same methods, we demonstrated a
substantial shift in prevalence approximately one month later, which coincided with changes in
community restrictions and public interactions. Notably, CREST performed as well as the CDCrecommended RT-qPCR assay. Our study substantiates, for the first time, the utility of selfcollected OP swabs and CRISPR-based testing as valuable alternatives for large-scale
surveillance sampling of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals.
Methods
Study population
UCSB’s population includes 26,134 students and 5,668 staff and faculty. 38% of the students live
in university housing, and 34% in the nearby community of Isla Vista (23,096 residents, 1.866 mi2,
12,377 people/mi2). This study was open to all symptom-free individuals, 18 years of age or older,
affiliated with UCSB (student, faculty, staff, direct relatives). Individuals who exhibited a fever
(100.4°F), cough, or shortness of breath in the two weeks before or on the day of sample collection
were excluded from the study. Only five subjects were excluded due to presenting symptoms at
the time of collection and were referred to local healthcare resources.
Sample collection
UCSB healthcare professionals collected informed consent and demographic data (age, address,
telephone, gender, and UCSB affiliation) at the sampling locale. Samples were assigned a
numeric code for deidentification purposes. Samples were acquired as self-collected OP swabs
stored in PBS, with surveillance by a healthcare professional. Samples were inactivated at 56 °C
for 30 minutes, and RNA was extracted using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen 57704)
or Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen 52906) from 140-200 µL of sample, and eluted in 50 µL. Pre- and
post-analytical protocols were reviewed and approved by the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital
IRB.
SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR (one-step TaqMan assay)
Viral RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the TaqPath one-step cDNA master mix
kit (ThermoFisher 501148245) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Reactions were
prepared as previously described1. Briefly, a 15 μL master mix reaction was prepared using the
established CDC protocol26, and 5 μL of RNA were added into the reaction with each of the targetspecific TaqMan primers and probes. For no template controls, 5 μL of nuclease-free water were
used. Positive control reactions used 106 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA encoding the SARSCoV-2 nucleocapsid sites N1 and N2. Reactions were run the BioRad CFX96 Touch qPCR
instrument with the thermal profile: 25 °C/2 minutes; 50 °C/15 minutes; 45 cycles of 95 °C/5

seconds followed by 55 °C/30 seconds and plate read; hold at 4 °C. Data were analyzed using
the BioRad CFX Maestro software using a single threshold for Cq determination. We prepared
standard curves of in vitro transcribed RNAs, ranging from 106 to 100 copies/μL, to determine
detection limits. One-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Dunnett's test was used to determine the Cq
value significance from no template control using Prism v8 software (Graphpad). The limit of
detection for N1 and N2 is 102 copies/µL (Cq of 32.59 and 34.405, respectively) and for RNaseP
103 copies/µL (Cq = 34.328). Samples were considered positive if the signal for both N1 and N2
was above the limit of detection.
CREST (Cas13-based, Rugged, Equitable, Scalable Testing)
CREST reactions were carried out as described1. Briefly, 5 µL of RNA were reverse transcribed
using RevertAid (200 U/μL, ThermoFisher Scientific) in the presence of murine RNase inhibitor
(NEB). Water was used as negative control. Positive control reactions used 106 copies of in vitro
transcribed RNA. The reaction mixtures were heated to 42 °C/30 minutes, then placed on ice. 2
µL of the resulting cDNAs was used as templates for PCR amplification with Taq DNA polymerase
(NEB), using the thermal profile: 98 °C/2 minutes; 20 cycles of 98 °C/15 seconds, 60 °C/15
seconds, and 72° C/15 seconds; final extension at 72°C/5 min. Cas13a was used for site-specific
detection using fluorescent probes. The reaction was performed in Cas13a cleavage buffer (40
mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 1 mM rNTPs (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 U/μL
RNase Inhibitor (NEB), 0.125 μM cleavage reporter (IDT), 1.5 U/μL T7 RNA Polymerase
(Lucigen), 6.3 ng/μL LwaCas13a, 20 nM Cas13 crRNA and 9 mM MgCl2. Reactions were
composed of 4 μL Cas13a cleavage solution and 1 μL of sample (RT-PCR product) in a well of a
384 well-plate, with samples run in duplicate or quadruplicate wells. Fluorescence was acquired
every 5 minutes for 30 minutes at 37 °C in a Quantstudio5 qPCR instrument (Applied Biosystems).
The initial reading taken at time = 0 was subtracted from time = 30 to get a DRFU for each well.
To determine a threshold for negative and positive results, DRFU from negative control wells were
multiplied by 5 and used as a cutoff. Plates were valid if negative control reactions did not increase
3x during the experiment. Samples were considered positive if the signal for both N1 and N2 was
5X above the background.

CREST Cleavage

6-FAM (Fluorescein) – (U)14 – BHQ (Blackhole quencher)

Analyses
Correlations between N1 and N2 and between CREST and TaqMan assays were calculated using
the Pearson correlation coefficient, assuming data are from a bivariate normal distribution, using
the R function cor.test(). Percent positive rates (shown in figure 4) were fit using a logistic growth
"#
model where Pcurrent = #$("&#)( )*+ , with K = 100%, P = 0.03, and r fit by minimizing the error found
to be r = 0.101.
Results
To obtain insights on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in our local community, we enrolled 1,808
healthy volunteers in a surveillance study. All participants were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at
the time of sample collection. Among the participants, 1,805 reported affiliation with UCSB, and
1,306 (72.2%) were undergraduate and graduate students (Sup. Fig. 1A). This population reflects
the composition of the UCSB community (Sup. Fig. 1A).
We acquired self-collected OP swabs from the participants over two time periods, from May 28 to
June 11 (Cohort 1), and from June 23 to July 2 (Cohort 2) (Fig. 1A). Over 70% of the subjects in
both cohorts self-identified as UCSB students (71% cohort 1; 73% cohort 2) (Fig. 1B), 45-47%
were male, 52-54% were female (Fig. 1C), and 67% of all participants reported the UCSB
neighboring communities of Goleta and Isla Vista as their place of residence (Sup. Fig. 1B). Our
study population's average age was 28.3 and 26.6 years old for cohort 1 and 2, respectively, with
a minimum age of 18 years old and a maximum of 73-75 years old (Fig 1D and Sup. Fig. 1C).
We used two assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the OP swab samples: CREST, a
CRISPR-Cas13-based method we recently developed1, and the RT-qPCR test recommended by
the CDC25, which we used as a point-of-reference (Sup. Fig. 2). Both methods detect two sites in
the nucleocapsid gene, N1 and N2, and one site in the host RNase P transcript, which ensured
consistency in our analyses. Samples were processed in-house with a turnaround time from 1230 hours from the moment of collection. All samples collected in cohort 1 (N = 732) were negative
by both tests (Fig. 2A, C). In contrast, we detected eight positive samples by CREST and nine by
RT-qPCR in cohort 2 (N = 1,076) (Fig. 2A, C). We found a good correlation in detecting the
nucleocapsid gene using the N1 and N2 primers (RT-qPCR, Pearson correlation coefficient r =
0.566, Fig 2B) and probes (CREST, Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.872, Fig. 2D). The
positive subjects' average age was 21.7 years old, and all self-identified as UCSB students (Sup.
Table 1). The eight samples detected by CREST were independently confirmed by a CLIAcertified laboratory test, and the results were reported to the participants and the Santa Barbara
County Public Health Department (SBCPH) by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital (SBCH) clinicians
(Fig. 1E). One sample was positive solely by RT-qPCR at the detection threshold, reflecting a low
viral copy number (Sup. Table 1, Sup. Table 3). With this single possible exception, RT-qPCR
and CREST results were concordant (Sup. Fig. 3).
The participants with positive tests were offered the opportunity to follow up with clinicians at the
UCSB student health service (SHS). Six out of eight individuals provided an update of symptoms

to the UCSB SHS. Two subjects reported no symptoms, two subjects reported mild symptoms
(nasal congestion, sore throat), and two subjects reported classic COVID-19 symptoms (fatigue,
anosmia). None of the participants reported fever as a symptom (Sup. Table 2).
To estimate the viral load in the asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic subjects confirmed as positive,
we calculated the genome equivalents per µL based on the Cq values for N1 and N2 from the
RT-qPCR assay, using linear regression on a standard curve ranging from 100 to 106 gene
copies/uL. Our study subjects' viral load ranged from 286 to 510,000 copies/µL (Sup. Table 3).
These viral load levels were not significantly different from those detected in a control set of deidentified residual nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples obtained from symptomatic patients in the
local community and provided to us by our collaborators at the SBCPHD (Sup. Table 3, Fig. 3).
Notably, the quality of the self-collected specimens using OP swabs was not significantly different
from those collected using NP swabs (positive and negative controls), as measured by the
detection of RNase P transcripts (p = 0.63, Kruskal-Wallis test) (Fig. 3).
Next, we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in our study population using the confirmed
cases. The viral prevalence of cohort 1 was 0%, while that of cohort 2 was 0.74%, with a daily
incidence ranging from 0 to 1.65% (Fig. 4, Sup. Table 4). The change in prevalence between
cohorts was statistically significant (p = 0.013, Fisher's exact test). The prevalence dynamics in
our study population reflect the increase in COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the UCSB neighboring
communities of Goleta and Isla Vista, where 67% of our participants reside (Fig .4). The increase
in the number of infections detected in our study—and those in Santa Barbara County—coincided
with the implementation of stage three of the California re-opening plan in Santa Barbara County
(Fig. 4, Sup. Fig. 5).
Discussion
As colleges and universities through the US struggle to recover from the academic, social, and
economic impacts of months of remote learning, a pressing trial remains: how to re-open
campuses safely? A primary challenge for university communities is the potential for covert
infections promoted by social and academic gatherings, which are unavoidable in the context of
a vibrant university campus. Recent evidence indicates that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
individuals can unknowingly transmit the virus and fuel covert outbreaks20,27,28. The early detection
of asymptomatic infections, particularly those with high SARS-CoV-2 loads like those detected in
our analyses, which may underlie super-spreader events, is vital for mitigating viral transmission
and containing outbreaks. This information is also essential to guide university directives to make
decisions regarding campus opening across the country and ensure superior education continuity.
Epidemiological models support this notion and suggest that universal and frequent SARS-CoV2 testing is necessary for efficient disease containment24. However, the economic impact of
providing reliable and regular testing for thousands of students, faculty, and staff may prohibit
larger campuses from closely monitoring their communities.
With the considerations above in mind, we evaluated for the first time the performance of our
recently developed CRISPR-based strategy for large-scale viral surveillance in asymptomatic
subjects. This method, known as CREST, uses PCR amplification and Cas13 for the detection of
viral genomes with a simple binary outcome. CREST is as efficient at detecting SARS-CoV-2
infections in asymptomatic subjects as the CDC recommended RT-qPCR, which is considered
the "gold standard" testing method. This CRISPR-based method also has the added benefit of
enabling an easy to interpret and dependable binary readout, fluorescence vs. no fluorescence.
CREST showed perfect concordance with positive cases diagnosed in a CLIA certified laboratory
(Pacific Diagnostics Laboratory), further corroborating its robustness. Because we designed

CREST to be a low-cost and accessible method, it offers a much-sought alternative for
communities where resources are limited, and where access to testing is difficult. Besides,
CREST is scalable, enabling high throughput testing, and it uses laboratory-generated or off-theshelf commercially available reagents, thus eliminating the restriction of limiting supply chains.
For these reasons, we surmise CREST can offer a solution for places where access to
professional laboratories is restrictive and instances in which a high volume of repetitive sampling
is necessary, including the university setting.
In addition to validating CREST as an alternative for surveillance testing, we also evaluated the
use of supervised self-collected OP swabs as the source sample for asymptomatic surveillance.
Self-collection methods minimize the risk of exposure for health care personnel and maximize
sample acquisition efficiency. Our data support that self-sampling by OP swab is dependable,
and thus provides an alternative method for unsupervised or remotely supervised sample
acquisition outside of a healthcare setting. OP and other self-sampling methods could enable
sample processing by mail, which can substantially enhance testing coverage29,30.
One of our most significant observations is the difference in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between
the two cohorts we analyzed. While we did not detect any infections in the 732 people tested in
May/June, approximately one month later, we demonstrated a shift in prevalence, with eight
confirmed cases among 1,076 asymptomatic people surveyed. This significant change in the
transmission dynamics coincided with the release of community restrictions and increased public
and social interactions during the implementation of stage three of the California re-opening plan
in Santa Barbara County. The increase in prevalence was exclusive to young and asymptomatic
individuals (average age 21.7 years old, range 19-30 years old) who self-identified as UCSB
students, and who may not otherwise have accessed COVID-19 testing. Individuals in this age
group are likely to be socially active, highlighting how easily covert infections could result in flareups. Our surveillance program detected the initial wave from a local outbreak and coincided with
rising case counts in the Goleta and Isla Vista localities, the Santa Barbara County, and the State
of California.
Overall, our study provides strong evidence supporting the use of CRISPR-based assays and
self-collected OP swabs and as feasible, rapid, and dependable tools for the surveillance of
SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals. The concordance between RT-qPCR testing and our
strategy of using OP swabs and CREST substantiates the feasibility of using simpler, equally
robust approaches for high-volume, recurrent testing, which is a desirable strategy to facilitate the
re-opening of colleges and universities. Monitoring the population to detect COVID-19 cases
before they lead to outbreaks could constitute the paramount containment and mitigation
approach within large campus communities and others facing similar challenges.

Figure 1. Description of the study and population demographics. (A) For this study, we
recruited 1,808 asymptomatic subjects in two cohorts during May, June, and July of 2020. The
arrows indicate the days of sample collection. We did not collect samples during the UCSB
summer break from June 11 to June 22. (B, C, D) Demographics of the study population, including
UCSB affiliation (B), gender (C), and age of study participants (D). (E) Flow chart of specimen
handling. We processed self-collected OP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing using CREST or RTqPCR. We handled samples downstream from testing according to the result. We did not report
negative results to the participants. We submitted positive results for confirmation with diagnostic
testing to a CLIA laboratory. Following confirmation, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital Clinicians
reported the positive results to the participants and the Santa Barbara County Public Health
Department (SBCPHD).

daily viral prevalence for the samples in this study as a percent of positive cases (red dots). We
calculated the trendline, indicated by the red dotted line, by finding the r in a logistic growth model
that minimized the error while fixing the percent prevalence on May 28 to 0.03%. The grey bars
represent the cumulative daily number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the Goleta and Isla Vista
communities, based on official data from the SBCPHD. The timing of stage two and three of the

Supplemental Figure 2. Overview of CREST and RT-qPCR protocols. (A) The participants
collected OP swabs, supervised by a healthcare provider. We extracted the RNA from the
samples and handled it according to the method to use for testing. For CREST, the RNA was
reverse transcribed, and the resulting DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
using primers for the N1, N2, and RNAse P target regions (see panel B). The amplified region of
interest was transcribed in vitro and used as the template for detection by Cas13. The activation
of Cas13 following target recognition by the guide RNA (gRNA) was measured using a fluorescent
poly-U cleavage reporter. For qPCR, the RNA was reverse transcribed and detected by real-time
amplification. (B) Genomic map of the SARS-CoV-2 genome regions detected in this study.

STAGE 1
Build out testing, contact tracing, PPE, and hospital surge capacity.
Make essential workplaces as safe as possible
Stay at home except for essential and permitted activities
Prepare sector-by-sector safety guidelines for expanded workforce.

STAGE 2
Gradually opening some lower risk workplaces with adaptations at
a pace designed to protect public health and safety (Retail,
manufacturing, outdoor museums, limited personal services)
Limit time outside the home. Travel only for permissible activities.

STAGE 3
Phase in higher-risk workplaces at a pace designed to protect
public health and safety, beginning with limited personal care
and recreational venues (with workplace modifications).
Restaurants, bars and breweries open.

STAGE 4
Gradually open larger gathering venues at a pace consistent
with public health and safety, such as nightclubs, concert
venues, and live audience sports.
Gradually resume remaining activities and travel.
