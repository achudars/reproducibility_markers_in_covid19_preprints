Abstract
Data from clinical studies suggests a strong association between underlying cardiometabolic
disease and worse outcomes in COVID-19. Given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a unique
marked affinity to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, one potential
explanation behind this phenomenon may involve the higher expression of ACE2 receptor in
these patients. Here, we analyzed association between polymorphisms in the ACE2 locus and
COVID-19 severity in 62 patients found to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction.
Of these patients, 23 required hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Of 61 ACE2 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in this patient cohort, 10 were significantly
associated with tissue expression of ACE2. Logistic regression adjusted for age and for sex
identified six of these ten SNPs to be significantly associated with hospitalization. These results
provide preliminary evidence of a genetic link between the ACE2 genotype and COVID-19
disease severity and suggest that the ACE2 genotype may inform COVID-19 risk stratification
and need for more intense therapy.

Introduction:
The mechanisms linked to severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has thus
far taken the lives of more than 400,000 people worldwide, are not yet understood. Data from
clinical studies suggests a strong association between underlying cardiometabolic disease and
worse outcomes in COVID-19.1 One potential explanation behind this phenomenon may involve
the higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in these patients.2
COVID-19 infection is caused by binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through its spike (S)
proteins to the ACE2 receptor, principally in Type II alveolar cells of the lung.3 ACE2 is also
highly expressed in cardiac tissue and vascular endothelial cells, which may therefore provide a
mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 promotes direct injury of these tissues.4,5 Since interactions
between the virus and ACE2 receptor are critical for virus entry into host cells, genetic
polymorphisms that regulate ACE2 expression and/or the strength of these interactions may
affect COVID-19 severity.6 Recent studies aimed to compare the prevalence of ACE2 functional
coding variants in different populations with endemic COVID-19.6-8 However, to date there are
no data showing a relationship between ACE2 genetic variants and clinical outcomes with
COVID-19. The present study aims to analyze novel associations between mRNA expressionaltering genetic variants of human ACE2 and clinical severity in patients with COVID-19.

Methods and Findings:
Consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 throughout the Partners Hospital System
who were previously genotyped as part of the Partners Biobank repository were studied. All
genotyping was performed using the Illumina Infinium MEGA Consortium v1 SNP array. The
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project dataset (v8 release) was used to determine SNPs

with a significant association with ACE2 tissue mRNA expression (expression quantitative trait
loci, eQTLs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5%.9 No coding variants were
included in analysis as none met the threshold of 5% MAF in this cohort. ACE2 is located on the
X chromosome but has been shown to escape X inactivation.10 Therefore, logistic regression
analysis adjusted for age and sex (Plink v1.07) was performed using allelic count where males
were 0 or 1 and females 0, 1, or 2. We analyzed the effects of ACE2 minor allele dosage on
requirement for hospitalization due to COVID-19. This study was approved by the Partners
institutional review board (IRB protocol #2020P000982).

Among 30,752 previously genotyped Caucasian patients in the Partners Biobank, 62 were
found to be COVID-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction between 1st March and 16th May
2020. Hospitalization status was determined on 27th May by review of the electronic medical
records. The median (IQR) age of this cohort was 62 (52, 73) years and 44% were female (Table
1). Of these patients, 23 (37%) required hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Across this
cohort, we performed a case/control genetic association analysis on ACE2 polymorphisms.9 Of
61 ACE2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in this patient cohort, 10 were
significant eQTLs for ACE2 in at least one tissue type (P<1E-4) with some exhibiting linkage
disequilibrium (Table 2). Of the 10 SNPs, five polymorphisms (rs4240157, rs6632680,
rs4830965, rs1476524, and rs2048683), with minor alleles that associated with higher tissue
expression of ACE2,9 were associated with increased need for hospitalization due to COVID-19
even after adjusting for age and sex (odds ratio 2.9-4.3, P<0.05 for all). Similarly, an ACE2
polymorphism (rs1548474) whose minor allele associated with lower tissue expression was

associated with lesser COVID-19 severity not requiring hospitalization (odds ratio 0.27, 95% CI
0.08-0.85, P=0.025, Table 3).

Discussion:
Previous studies have investigated the potential for ACE2 polymorphisms to explain
population-based differences in COVID-19 severity. Cao et al. found no direct evidence of
population differences in coronavirus S-protein binding-resistant mutants. However,
considerably higher allele frequencies for SNPs associated with higher ACE2 expression in
tissues were observed in the East Asian populations.6 Asselta et al. reported no significant
differences in the burden of rare deleterious ACE2 variants when comparing an Italian
population with Europeans and East Asians.7 In contrast, using single cell sequencing, Zhao et al.
demonstrated that ACE2 was more abundantly expressed in type II alveolar cells from an Asian
male donor, when compared to white and African American donors.8 Whilst these studies shed
light on the contribution of ACE2 genetic variation on population-based differences in
coronavirus etiology, our analysis is the first to identify ACE2 polymorphisms that may influence
disease severity. Importantly, genetic variants that have been associated with ACE2 mRNA
expression levels associated with disease severity. Further studies that analyze the expression
altering effects of these polymorphisms in lung and cardiovascular tissue will be informative to
fully understand their role in COVID-19 infectivity and disease severity.
Conclusion:
In summary, in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing genotypic data, we
found that six out of ten eQTL variants in ACE2, that are associated with altered ACE2 tissue
expression, were associated with the need for hospitalization due to COVID-19. These results,

although requiring replication in a validation cohort and in non-Caucasian populations, provide
preliminary evidence of a genetic link between the ACE2 genotype and COVID-19 disease
severity and suggest that the ACE2 genotype may inform COVID-19 risk stratification and need
for more intense therapy.
