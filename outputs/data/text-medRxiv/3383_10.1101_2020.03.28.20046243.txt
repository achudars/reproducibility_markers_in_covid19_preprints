Abstract

22

We statistically investigate the Coronavirus Disease 19 (hereinafter Covid-19) epidemics, which is

23

particularly invasive in Italy. We show that the high apparent mortality (or Case Fatality Ratio,

24

CFR) observed in Italy, as compared with other countries, is likely biased by a strong

25

underestimation of infected cases. To give a more realistic estimate of the mortality of Covid-19,

26

we use the most recent estimates of the IFR (Infection Fatality Ratio) of epidemic, based on the

27

minimum observed CFR, and furthermore analyse data obtained from the ship Diamond Princess, a

28

good representation of a ‘laboratory’ case-study from an isolated system in which all the people

29

have been tested. From such analyses we derive more realistic estimates of the real extension of the

30

infection, as well as more accurate indicators of how fast the infection propagates. We then point

31

out from the various explanations proposed, the dominant factors causing such an abnormal

32

seriousness of the disease in Italy. Finally, we use the deceased data, the only ones estimated to be

33

reliable
enough, to predict the total number of infected people and the interval of time when the

Introduction

36
37

The infection of Covid-19, recently declared pandemic by WHO, represents perhaps one of the

38

most serious worldwide emergencies, potentially able to destroy social order and economies and to

39

deeply change our lifestyle in the near future. Since the first appearance of this new Coronavirus

40

(SARS-CoV-2) (Worldometers, 2020), however, the Covid-19 infection has been treated with very

41

mixed feelings: from just a disease a little more serious than a seasonal flu, to a very severe and

42

troubling infection. The epidemics was firstly detected in China, in the city of Wuhan, at the end of

43

December 2019. After some interlocutory days, the government of China showed serious concern

44

and implemented very severe measures in the Hubei province, the centre of the epidemics, to

45

contain the epidemic spreading of the infection. About 45 days after the first detection (mid-

46

February 2020), the epidemics started to seriously affect several other countries (South Korea

47

among the firsts, being a rather natural candidate that borders with China). Since the end of

48

February, it flared up in Italy and Iran for less clear reasons and, since mid-March 2020, the

49

epidemics has spread all over Europe, in the USA, and many other countries (Worldometers, 2020).

50

Here we want to focus on the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy that shows some peculiar features,

51

distinguishing its evolution from the one observed in other countries. The epidemic appears very

52

aggressive, both in terms of spread rate and mortality, which are however very uncertain parameters

53

for this new virus. In Italy, the infection is mainly focused in the Lombardia Region and the area

54

around the Po river. The most affected regions are Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, which

55

also represent the richest and more productive parts of Italy. In Italy the infection grew very fast,

56

overcoming South Korea in the number of infected people as early as in the beginning of March

57

2020, today (March 30th, 2020) reaching 101739 total infections. Moreover, it showed an average

58

Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) over 11%, well above any other country and more than double with

59

respect to the Hubei Region in China, where the new virus first appeared, and where CFR was

60

significantly higher than in other parts of the China and higher than several countries in the world.

61

In this paper, we will show statistical analyses of data associated to the Italian Covid-19 epidemics.

62

The aim is to estimate a possible slowdown of the infection and also to verify our statistical

63

predictions in relation with the severe containment measures taken by the Italian Government. We

64

discuss alternative explanations for the very high CFR observed. To confront with the important

65

problem of determining the true mortality (Infection Fatality Ratio, IFR) of the epidemics, we use

66

the study of an isolated, well-calibrated test case, represented by the infection spread on the

67

Diamond Princess cruise ship. Mortality (IFR) estimates obtained within the Diamond Princess are

68

an ‘unbiased’ value, not affected by the underestimation of the number of infected people; also IFR

69

values computed by the University of Oxford (Oke and Henegan, 2020) were checked. Using

70

various IFR estimations, we predict a much larger number of infected people in Italy with respect to

71

the official one, suggesting that the CFR highly overestimates true mortality. We also discuss the

72

likelihood of alternative hypotheses, often claimed to explain the high impact of Covid-19 in Italy,

73

based on the influence of old average age of population, high antibiotic resistance, high number of

74

smokers, pollution in the Po plain (e.g. Oke and Henegan, 2020). Finally, we identify the best data

75

set to analyse the statistical evolution of the epidemics in Italy, also comparing it with its

76

prototypical behaviour obtained from the China dataset, to try to forecast the time of saturation of

77

the infection.

78
79

The Covid-19 in Italy

80
81

The Covid-19 epidemic in Italy presents some peculiarities that make it very intriguing to analyse

82

and understand. Initially it was thought that two independent focuses started in Codogno (15962

83

inhabitants, Lodi province, Lombardia Region) and Vo’ Euganeo (3416 inhabitants, Padua

84

province, Veneto Region) towns, but it is now generally understood that the virus started circulating

85

earlier in the whole north of Italy. The epidemic rapidly blew up all over Italy, but particularly

86

around the Po Valley, in Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. These Regions are the richest

87

ones in Italy, for their industries, agriculture in the Po Valley and international commerce. The

88

Lombardia and the Po Valley, the most hit by the infection, are also the most polluted areas in Italy

89

and probably also the most polluted in the whole Europe by the fine air particulate matter (PM10,

90

PM2.5) and Ozone (Martuzzi et al., 2006; Stafoggia et al., 2009).

91

The beginning and evolution of Covid-19 infection in Italy, and more specifically in Lombardia

92

Region, is from many points of view anomalous and highly lethal, with respect to all other countries

93

worldwide, including China where the infection was born. Although all the media (and also many

94

specialists interviewed by media) highlight the velocity of infection in Italy as ‘exponential’, the

95

number of infected people has never followed an exponential distribution, except in the very first

96

few days. Figure 1a shows the number of recorded infections as a function of time (in days since

97

February 24th 2020) in a semi-logarithmic scale. It is evident that the distribution is markedly

98

different from a straight line, typical of an exponential distribution in such a scale, and it’s rather

99

well fitted by a cubic polynomial, which is much slower than an exponential. The cubic polynomial

100

fit and the exponential one present in the figure are both carried out using the data up to 18 days

101

from the date of acknowledgment of the first cases (from 24th February to 12th March); starting

102

from that date the cubic fit scores, according to an Akaike information criterion (AIC) test, better

103

than the exponential one. In the figure we also show the fit obtained from a logistic function for

104

comparison; logistic fit scores (AIC test; Akaike, 1974) become better than the exponential one

105

from 12th March and definevely better of the cubic one after 25th March. Figure 1b shows the same

106

quantity in a linear scale, together with the three mentioned fitting functions.

107

Although the number of infected people is the main parameter taken into account by the authorities,

108

and the most highlighted by media, its real value is largely uncertain and surely underestimated. In

109

fact, it critically depends from the number of laboratory tests made on people to ascertain the

110

infection, which is anyway limited and very small as compared with the number of inhabitants.

111

Furthermore, the procedure to test people are highly variable within the different Regions of Italy

112

and have changed over time in the last weeks; because of this inconsistency, this number is

113

statistically very inhomogeneous and unfit to to interpret the actual evolution of the infection.

114

The number of tests in Italy, highly fluctuating but generally increasing in time except in the last

115

days, ranged from about 2427 (February 27th) to 26336 (March 21st), and decreased again to 25180

116

(March 22nd) and 17066 (March 23rd). More recently, it reached a peak value of 36615 on March

117

26th but then it decreased in the next days (Il Sole 24 Ore, 2020). A very important quantity, namely

118

the CFR, defined as the ratio of number of people deceased divided by number of total recorded

119

infections, is extremely high in Italy (about 11%). Such a high value is dominated by the mortality

120

in Lombardia, where about 50% of all the Italian infections have been recorded, with a CFR of

121

about 16%. CFR is a generally overestimated value of the true mortality (IFR), given the likely

122

underestimation of the real number of infection cases (i.e. including asymptomatic and pauci-

123

symptomatic cases, which are easily overlooked by the small number of tests). IFR is the parameter

124

which measure the percentage of deceases over the total population infected (including the

125

generally unknown number of non recorded cases). Table 1 (Oke and Henegan, 2020) reports the

126

number of infections, deaths and CFR observed in several countries in the world as of March 30th,

127

2020. It is possible to note that the mortality rate for different countries is very variable, going from

128

a minimum of 0.4% (i.e. Australia, Israel) to a maximum of 11.3% in Italy. Several observations are

129

however around 1%-2% (Germany, USA, Austria, Portugal, Ireland, etc.). It appears evident,

130

therefore, that the CFR of Italy, and even more of Lombardia Region, is absolutely extreme when

131

compared to any other country. This CFR is more than double of the CFR obtained in China, where

132

the epidemic first appeared. Therefore, besides CFR, it is important to obtain a reasonable

133

estimation of the IFR already during the epidemic spread, to understand the real hazard of the

134

disease and/or to determine the real amount of infected people.

136

The IFR for Covid-19 and the mortality in Italy

137
138

The problem of unbiased estimation of the IFR for Covid-19 is complicated by the complex

139

laboratory procedures that are necessary to identify the infected cases, ultimately limiting the total

140

number of tested individuals. Since the IFR is the ratio between the number of deceased due to the

141

disease and the total number of infected, the CFR, which is computed on the number of ‘known’

142

infected is an upper limit of IFR. Normally, CFR (and hence IFR) should be determined at the end

143

of epidemic, because decease occurs at the end of the epidemic cycle, delayed with respect to the

144

infection. Usually, at the very beginning of an epidemic, the CFR can be underestimated just

145

because the outcome of the disease (recovered or deceased) has not yet been reached. For Covid-19,

146

however, it was noted in China (and in South Korea too) that CFR was generally higher in the first

147

phase of the infection spreading. A further problem is that the amount of underestimated infected

148

cases is generally variable and could become progressively more critical as the real number of

149

infected rapidly rises with time, while the number of tests remains stationary. Furhtermore, mass-

150

testing in the village of Vo’ Euganeo suggested that the number of asymptomatic persons infected

151

by the Covid-19 is at least 50% (La Repubblica, 2020). From Table 1 we observe that each country

152

has a very variable CFR associated to the Covid-19 infection. Since the IFR is intrinsically

153

overestimated by the CFR, presuming the virus strain is the same in every country, we can assume

154

the minimum value of the observed CFR as the minimum upper limit for IFR. Following this

155

procedure, the University of Oxford used one of the minimum CFR values (around 0.4%), namely

156

from Israel, Australia and recently also Iceland, and to properly account for the undetected

157

asymptomatics, halved it to obtain an IFR = 0.2% (Oke and Henegan, 2020). On the other hand,

158

Italian CFR is very similar to what is observed in hospital casistic (11%) (Chen N. et al, Lancet

159

2020), which attest the attitude to test especially in-hospital and severe cases, being unaware of

160

mild and asyntomatic patients.

161

For the Covid-19 epidemics, moreover, there is an independent way to obtain a rather unbiased

162

estimate of IFR using the only ‘laboratory-like’ case study: the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship

163

anchored in the port of Yokohama from February 4th to March 2nd. Here, all the 3711 passengers

164

and crew were tested and 712 (19.2%) persons had positive test results. Of these, 331 (46.5%) were

165

asymptomatic at the time of testing, a similar value to the one obtained in Vo’ Euganeo. Among

166

381 symptomatic patients, 37 (9.7%) required intensive care, and 9 died (Moriarty L. F. et al.,

167

2020). Because the Diamond Princess is a perfectly isolated case in which all the people have been

168

tested, the total number of infected is perfectly known and we can assume that IFR=CFR. The crude

169

IFR computed from the Diamond Princess is then 1.3%. Because this number is statistically

170

affected by a rather large uncertainty due to the small number of deceased, we can then assume that

171

the IFR of Covid-19 is less than 1.3%; indeed, the observation of a CFR significantly smaller than

172

1% in some countries (i.e. Australia, Norway, Israel) indicate that lower values are more probable

173

than larger ones. In the light of such derived mortality range, it appears very abnormal the observed

174

CFR in Italy (11.3%), and even more the CFR in the Lombardia Region (16.1%).

175

In the following, we will try to point out the possible explanations for such an extremely anomalous

176

outcome. We will, again, assume that the virus strain is the same in every country, since there are

177

not contrary evidences till now. The first, more obvious reason to explain such a high mortality, is

178

to hypothesize that the number of infected cases is substantially underestimated. A clear sign of this

179

is the fact that mortality increases during time, from around 2% at the beginning (February 20th) to

180

11% on March 30th. During this period the number of detected cases rose from few units to around

181

100000, whereas the daily number of laboratory tests changed from few hundreds to about 30000.

182

Besides the CFR, which is only linked to the recorded infection cases, what is really interesting to

183

understand is a ‘local’ IFR estimation for Italy, in order to derive the real total number of infected

184

people. Lacking evidence for the existence of a different virus strain, more aggressive and lethal in

185

Italy, we firstly assume that IFR is the same as in other places, and a distinctive trait of this

186

epidemic. We could then choose between the University of Oxford estimate of IFR=0.2% or the

187

Diamond Princess laboratory-like estimation of IFR=1.3%. If the extreme mortality observed would

188

be only due to the underestimation of the number of infected people, assuming a ‘true’ IFR ranging

189

between 0.2% and 1.3%, to correct for the Italian 11.3% CFR, we should multiply, respectively, by

190

56.5 or by 8.7 the official number of infected cases (101739 on March 30th); the resulting number

191

would then range between about 885000 and 5.7 million infected people.

192

We cannot exclude, however, the true IFR in Italy to be significantly higher than in other countries

193

because of several concurrent reasons. For instance, the higher average age of Italian people has

194

often been indicated as a possible explanation for the high Covid-19 CFR. Among all the countries

195

of the world, Italy is actually in the second position for higher average age; however, the first

196

position (oldest population) is occupied by Japan, which showed a very low number of infections

197

and CFR (see Table 1) so that this possibility appears unlikely.

198

Another possible cause of comorbidity could be related to the high level of pollution in Lombardia

199

Region that is likely the most polluted region in Europe by fine particulate (PM10, PM2.5) and

200

Ozone. As shown in several papers (e.g. Chen et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Setti

201

et al., 2020) there is a correlation between the diffusion of viruses and the pollution by fine

202

particulate. Furthermore, exposition to fine powders contributes to enhance the severity for

203

respiratory viral infections (Dominici et al., 2006; Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007). The incidence of

204

fine particulate pollution could hence, in principle, be one of the reasons for the high mortality rate

205

observed in Lombardia (and partially in Emilia-Romagna, around the Po Valley). Although an

206

effect of this kind of pollution in amplifying the mortality observed for a severe pulmonary disease

207

seems reasonable, it is actually very difficult to quantify its incidence. It is also very difficult to

208

believe it can be so strong with respect to other highly industrialized areas of Europe (e.g. Germany,

209

France, Netherlands, etc.). Moreover, a recent document issued by the Italian Aerosol Society,

210

signed by about 60 scientists of various disciplines, rejects various hypotheses (Setti et al., 2020),

211

pointing out that there is no clear evidence for a correlation between fine particulate and Covid-19

212

disease amplification (Contini et al., 2020).

213

Other tentative explanations for the extreme mortality could be the high number of smokers in Italy

214

and the antibiotic-resistance of Italian people. Regarding the percentage of smoking people,

215

however, Italy’s 23% is lower than the European average, 29% (WHO, 2016); regarding the

216

antibiotic-resistance, on the contrary, Italy has actually the most critical position in Europe. Among

217

about 33000 yearly deceases in EU due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, about 10000 occur in Italy

218

alone (ISS, 2019). Since generally therapies used against the SARS-CoV-2 involve one or more

219

antibiotics, this issue could, in principle, result in higher mortality. Also in this case, however, it is

220

not easy to quantify this effect, which however appears marginal in seasonal flu, since in this case

221

CFR for Italy does not differ too much with respect to other European countries (ISS, 2019).

222

Moreover, Covid-19 antibiotics administration aims to avoid bacterial superinfection, whose

223

mortality is negligible; so even if there was a more pronounced antibiotic resistance and this

224

mechanism would be implied in higher mortality, this would probably account for only a very little

225

part of the deaths. The remaining possibility is that the healthcare was unprepared for such an

226

emergency due to a respiratory syndrome; actually, we just note that in Italy (60 million people),

227

there were, before Covid-19 epidemic, about 5090 places in Intensive Care Units (ICU); for

228

comparison in Germany (82 million people) such places were 28000. Actually, in terms of number

229

of ICU divided by population, Italy occupies the 19th position among 23 European Countries. We

230

observe indeed high pressure on ICU by severe/critical cases, mainly in Lombardia, where the

231

number of ICU before the crisis was 900; this number increased to over 1000 during the last weeks,

232

but, as of March 30th, the patients hosted in ICU are more than 1300. Indeed, already on March 14th,

233

the Government of Lombardia declared that available ICU were almost over. Another indication

234

that something went wrong during the first phase of management of the infection by the Lombardia

235

Hospitals is the very high number (6414) of infected medical staff (ISS daily Info, March 30th). So,

236

the Hospitals could have been the most effective carriers for the epidemic in the first phase in

237

Lombardia, when a very fast increase was observed.

238
239

Possible forecast of future behaviour of infection

240
241

In order to forecast the evolution and the end of the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy, we could in

242

principle use three kinds of data. The most obvious would be the daily infection data. However,

243

such data are particularly unreliable, because too much dependent from the daily number of tests.

244

They are generally very variable and inhomogeneous, both from a Region to another, and also in

245

time. Since, as we noted, the real number of infected people is likely much higher (orders of

246

magnitude) with respect to the sampled one, the inhomogeneous sampling can strongly condition

247

the number of infections, making them not useful for a statistical study. Another possible indicator

248

of the epidemic evolution is the number of people in ICU. Contrarily to the number of infected, the

249

number of people in ICU should be objective, because who has serious breathing problems must

250

necessarily be hospitalized in ICU. However, in this phase of the epidemic crisis, this number has

251

two major problems: the first one is that ICU places are mostly full, at least in Lombardia which

252

dominates the Italian statistics, so not all people requiring them can be allocated. The second

253

problem is that the daily numbers given by Italian Civil Protection just mention the total number of

254

people hosted in ICUs in that day, and not the daily incremental number. Hence, it is not possible to

255

know the real cumulative number of people hosted in ICUs, because we don’t know how many

256

people each day came out from them, due to recovering or death.

257

The only quantity which has a rather rigorous statistical meaning, then, is the daily cumulative

258

number of deceases. We then choose to use this number in order to statistically analyse the

259

evolution of epidemic and to predict its end. Obviously, since we are particularly interested in

260

determining the time at which the epidemic ends and the total number of infected people cumulated

261

at the end of the epidemic, we have to correctly consider the relation of the daily cumulative

262

number of deceases with the cumulative number of infected people. The number of deceased people

263

is linked to the number of infected one by the IFR=D/I (D= deceased, I=infected); then, correcting

264

the number of deceases for the constant factor represented by the inverse of IFR (I/D) gives the

265

number of infected people. However, we must also consider that infection and decease are just the

266

two temporal limits of the disease: it starts with infection, proceeds with the symptoms, and then

267

ends with one of the two possibilities: recovering or death. To account for this, we must consider

268

the shift in time between the infection and the decease. For Covid-19, it has been estimated that the

269

average time from infection to death is 16 days, with this value being about the median in the

270

interval of confidence [13.1 – 17.7] (Jung et al., 2020). With such relations in mind between

271

infected and deceased people, we fit the decease data to a logistic function of the general form:

272

𝑦 𝑡 =𝐾

273

To validate the use of this function, in Figure 2 we show the fit made using a logistic function, to

274

the epidemic curve of the cumulative daily number of cases (infections) reported in the whole

275

China, Hubei province and China without Hubei province. It is clear that, after the epidemic spread

276

is over, the whole epidemic behaviour from the start to the end can be well described by the logistic

277

function.

278

To describe the evolution of the epidemic in Italy, as we explained, we decided to use the

279

cumulative daily number of deceases to fit the logistic function, simply because is a much more

280

reliable quantity when compared to the total reported cases. Figure 3a-b shows the fits of the

281

deceased data reported in Italy (green), Lombardia (blue) and Italy without Lombardia (red), until

282

March 30th, with a logistic function and its derivative. From the derivative of the logistic function,

283

we observe that the model gives a rather good fit to the data until March 26th, whereas, after such a

284

date, the number of deceases remains high, so perturbing the data around the peak, which does not

285

decrease as the curve would previously predict. However, if we separate the data of Lombardia

286

from the rest of Italy we see that the result is much more regular (red line). The curves, logistic and

287

its derivative, are in this case both well constrained, and the peak value seems to have occurred on

288

March 27th. The anomaly of the data of Lombardia is even more evident by considering the data of

289

Emilia Romagna Region, which is the second more affected region according to the official reports.

290

Figure 4a-b shows in red the logistic fit (and its derivative) to the cumulative (and new) number of

291

deaceases in Emila Romagna. Also in this case, it is evident the data are well fitted and the curves

292

well constrained. The peak value occurs around March 24th, coherently with this region being

293

among the first ones where the infection began. Besides Emilia-Romagna, which represents a good

294

example of a region in which the epidemic is already ‘mature’ (in the sense that the peak of

295

deceases has already been overcome), it is interesting to see what happens in one of the Southern

296

Italy regions, for example Calabria, where the infection presumibly started later. This data is also

297

shown in Figure 4 for comparison, in blue. It is clear that, since the epidemic here has not reached

298

yet the peak value, the curves are poorly constrained and the future evolution is still very uncertain.

299

The difference between Emilia Romagna and Calabria curves illustrates well the different

300

behaviour of the epidemic in the different Regions, and mainly between the Northern and the

301

Southern ones.

302

To estimate now the cumulative number of infections, we decided to use several tentative values of

303

IFR: the one computed from the University of Oxford, IFR=0.2%; the one computed from the

304

mortality on the Diamond Princess, IFR=1.3%; and one much larger, in case the IFR for Italy

305

would be much larger than in other countries, IFR=5%. This high percetange can take into account

306

the hospital saturation issues that could have locally amplified the IFR. Such a large range of IFRs

307

for conversion is useful to check the final amount of total infected but also to determine the portion

308

of unreported cases in respect to the official numbers.

309

In order to estimate the total number of infected cases, we take the less-noisy data from Italy

310

without Lombardia but we normalize the number of deceases to be equal to the total Italian

311

deceases (including the Lombardia ones) at the last date (March 30th). This procedure is used in

312

order to remove some data scattering introduced by the Lombardia reported number of deceases

313

without, on the other hand, underestimating the total number of infected. In Figure 5, we report the

314

fit of the estimated amount of total cases in whole Italy with the procedure that we just described.

315

The different logistic curves (blue, red and green), present in the figure, are the estimated number of

316

contagious people for the different IFR values of 0.2%, 1.3% and 5%, respectively. From these

317

values we also subtract the number of cases reported by Italian Civil Protection to estimate the

318

number of unreported contagious cases (light blue, pink, light green); the parameters obtained from

319

the best fits are reported in Table 2. It is evident that the number of reported cases is only a minor

320

fraction of the estimated number of contagious people. In particular, for an IFR of 0.2%, 1.3% and

321

5% we estimate in the whole Italy a total number of cases at March 30th (35 days from the first

322

declared red zone) of about 8 milions, 1.2 milions and 300000, depending on the 0.2, 1.3 and 5 %

323

IFR value, respectively. With a total number of reported cases of about 100000, Italy might be

324

strongly underestimating the total number of infected people (including asymptomatic and pauci-

325

symptomatic persons) of 98.75%, 91.6% or 66.6% depending on the IFR. From the time

326

dependence of the logistic function, we observe that the inflections of the respective curves are now

327

exceeded by the data points, whatever the conversion factor IFR is used. This probably means that

328

Italy as a whole have already overcome the maximum number of new daily infections. In particular,

329

the peak value of the infections should have been reached around March 11th, one week after the

330

closing of schools and just after the lockdown of Italy. Moreover, our results predict that the point

331

of 95% of the maximum value of the best fitting logistic curves has been already reached on the last

332

week of March, and that, within the first week of April, the real number of contagious people will

333

be already well within the saturation, so that it practically will not increase anymore.

334

It is possible that after the epidemic spread in Italy will be over, growth functions different from the

335

logistic like Gompertz (1832), Janoschek (1957) or Richards (1959) sigmoids could be more suited

336

to describe the epidemic spread because they allow their derivative to be non-symmetric and

337

therefore can result in a more generalized integral function. A non symmetric integral curve, with a

338

slower derivative in the descending part after the peak, could result for instance by a differential

339

shift of epidemic curves for different Regions (and particularly for the Southern ones), due to the

340

delay of the infection starting with respect to Lombardia, the first nucleus of infection spreading.

341

When compared to the logistic function, a typical variation of these more generalized growth

342

functions is the shift of the inflection point a few days later and the increase of the saturation value.

343

Because here we are highlighting an extreme underestimation of the reported cases in Italy already

344

with a simple logistic function, our main result would be even more inflated by the use of other

345

growth functions. Nevertheless, despite this inherent limitation of the logistic function, as of March,

346

30th, data which overcome the inflexion point are reasonably well constrained, also if they do not

347

cover the higher part of the curve. This, together with the test on the infection curve of China

348

already shown in Figure 2, demonstrates that the logistic curve provides a robust approximation of

349

the epidemic, at least during its spread.

350
351

Discussion

352
353

The Covid-19 epidemic in Italy shows very abnormal features, in terms of severity of disease and,

354

particularly, mortality. The CFR (defined as the ratio between the number of deceased and the

355

number of recorded infected) reaches here very high values, disproportioned with respect to any

356

other country: about 11%, rising to about 16% in the Lombardia Region, which alone represents

357

half of the total number of infected people in Italy. Estimating a reliable value of the IFR (the ratio

358

between the number of deceases and the total number of infected people) during the epidemic, for a

359

virus hard to diagnose and requiring complex laboratory procedures, is very difficult. In this case,

360

we considered two approaches: the first one, used by University of Oxford (Oke and Henegan,

361

2020) is based on the minimum reliable CFR values. The other one benefits of the possibility to

362

study a very peculiar laboratory-like case study, namely the case of Diamond Princess, the cruise

363

ship remaining at anchor in Japan (in the port of Yokohama) in which all the passengers and crew

364

(3771 people) were tested for Covid-19. University of Oxford assumed a 50% of non recorded

365

infected; in this way, they computed a value of IFR=0.2%. In the alternative approach, we

366

considered that in the Diamond Princess cruise ship 712 infected were detected, and 9 of them died.

367

So, the mostly unbiased value of IFR=CFR=1.3% can be computed. We have then considered these

368

values as the limiting values defining the range of IFR. If we assume that the infection number

369

underestimation is the only reason for the large overestimation of the mortality rate, in order to

370

determine the real number of infected cases able to correct the apparent mortality to the true value,

371

we should multiply the ‘official’ number of recorded infections by the ratio between the

11

372

CFR=11.3% and the IFR (=0.2% or 1.3%). In this way, we obtain a real number of infected people

373

in Italy (today, March 30th) ranging between about 885000 and 5.7 million people infected.

374

Even if this number appears very high (mainly with respect to the total number of reported cases of

375

less than 90.000 in China, where however, using the same assumption, this amount should be

376

multiplied by 4), it is not unreasonable for several reasons. Firstly, besides the high number of tests

377

made in Italy (about 500000), this is still only a small fraction of the total population (60 million

378

people), and does not take into account the number of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic cases.

379

This is confirmed by observing that CFR in Italy is very similar to percent of death detected in

380

hospital case series (Chen at al., 2020). The large number of potential daily infections in Italy

381

during mobility for work or study can be also independently estimated by the statistics of the use of

382

public transportation (the most likely to cause infection due to the high number of people assembled

383

in small space). It results that 30 million people moves in Italy each day for work or study, with

384

peak values in Lombardia (ISTAT report, 2017): about 56% of these people use public

385

transportation; two thirds of the total travel for more than 15 minutes. So, considering only such a

386

number of assembled people, and neglecting the likely high incidence of student assemblage in

387

schools, of people in work places, and the more or less occasional frequentations of restaurants,

388

clubs, pubs, sport matches, theatres, supermarkets etc., we get a minimum estimate of about 11

389

million people staying in close contact each day. A final indication that such number of effective

390

infected cases is not unrealistic comes from the exponential fit of the first days of infection (Fig. 1);

391

by extrapolating that exponential curve till March 30th it would predict about 1 million infected

392

cases. Obviously, such an hypothesis would assume that the exponential increase lasted till March

393

30th (or however till few days before) and that the real exponential curve was missed because the

394

limited number of tests progressively sampled a smaller and smaller percentage of the true daily

395

number. From any point of view, in conclusion, a real number of 0.9-5.7 x106 infected people today

396

does not appear unrealistic.

397

Other reasons could however equally affect the very high mortality observed (as CFR): discarding

398

the existence in Italy of a virus strain significantly different and more aggressive (hypothesis

399

actually impossible to verify because there is not yet the Italian genome available), a possible

400

contribution could come from the relative high air pollution (from particulate matter PM10, PM2.5

401

and Ozone) of the zone around the Po Valley, where more than 50% of counted infections are

402

clustered. Among the other hypothesized causes, the high average age (however lower than Japan,

403

which showed a much lower CFR) is not likely to play a fundamental role; nor it is the number of

404

smoking people (lower than the EU average). The observed high antibiotic-resistance, the highest

405

one in Europe, has been also indicated as a possible contributing factor. However, although such

406

problem causes in Italy about one third (10000 cases; the double of France, and fourfold of

407

Germany) of the total deceases for antibiotic resistance in the whole EU (33000 cases), it does not

408

appear to significantly affect the mortality (CFR) associated to seasonal flu (the most reliable

409

comparison we can do, to infer the possible effect on Covid-19 mortality), which seems not

410

significantly higher with respect to other European countries. We can compare, for instance, the

411

number of deaths directly or indirectly associated to seasonal flu (the number of indirect deaths is

412

much more significant in this case, because it is mostly linked to bacteria super-infections) in Italy

413

and in Germany (where Covid-19 CFR is about 1%). The average yearly number of such deaths in

414

Italy is around 8000 (ISS, 2020); in Germany, the deaths associated with the 2017-2018 flu,

415

although very severe that year, totalled 25.000 (Koch Institute, 2019). Another issue that often

416

comes out as a possible bias in the mortality estimates for Italy is the way of counting equally

417

people dead ‘with’ or ‘by’ the infection. Actually, we do not think this question can seriously affect

418

the data, provided only infected people dead for pulmonary collapse (or else for collapse of other

419

organs following a serious pulmonary disease) are counted, as likely. On the contrary, an interesting

420

issue, given the high selectivity of the disease towards old and/or multi-pathology people, will be to

421

understand, at the end of the year, the total deaths caused, cumulatively, by all the seasonal diseases

422

(flu, infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, walking pneumonia, Covid-19).

423

A significant contribution to the increase of the “local” IFR could, on the contrary, have come from

424

the saturation of the public Hospitals, and in particular from the limited number (as compared for

425

instance to Germany) of ICU. Italy, before the Covid-19 epidemic, had in fact 8.4 ICU per 105

426

citizens (5090 ICU total), whereas Germany had 34 of them (28000 ICU total). Also, some wrong

427

actions taken by the public Hospitals in managing the first days of infection (testified by many

428

media and by a dramatic percentage of infected medical staff), could have significantly enhanced

429

the infection. As of March 30th, 2020, 51 doctors died and 6414 people from the medical staff have

430

been infected (ISS daily Info, March 30th, 2020). Moreover, the anomalous behaviour (with a

431

persisting high number of deceases) in Lombardia, whereas the trend of deceases for the whole Italy

432

excluding Lombardia is much more regular, also suggests some problems in that region, which has

433

the most critical numbers and where the infection started. Such problems would likely involve

434

insufficience of the sanitary system, stressed above the critical point, by the extreme numbers of

435

people hospitalized (11883) or in ICUs (1324).

436

In this paper, we also use an indirect procedure, based on the analysis of the cumulative number of

437

deceases which is the only reliable datum, in order to forecast the short-term evolution of the

438

epidemic in Italy. As we have discussed, the number of recorded infections is not statistically

439

reliable for such analyses, since inhomogeneous in time and in space (among different Regions).

440

Considering correctly the average time shift of the death with respect to the infection (16 days used

441

here) we show that decease data, converted to infection data using a large range of possible IFR, are

442

well fitted by logistic functions, all of them indicating the time of 95% of total infection (i.e. the

443

starting of the flat part of the function, which represents the end of infection), is expected around

444

the last days of March. The point of inflection of the logistic best fitting functions, which

445

corresponds to the peak of the infections in Italy, occurred around March 11th given the interval of

446

confidence over the delay time from sympthomps to death (Jung et al 2020). Looking at Figure 5,

447

this date occurs just after the lockdown of the whole Italy and it demonstrates the high mitigating

448

impact of the lockdowns; however, since it also occurs only from 4 to 10 days after the closing of

449

the schools, it probably indicates that this measure has also been effective in containing the

450

infection. Indeed, the high effectiveness of the closure of schools for containing epidemic spread

451

has been specifically assessed by a number of epidemiologic studies (i.e. Adda, 2016).

452

Our results also put in evidence the shift of the infections curves between the Northern regions

453

where the infection started (i.e. Emilia Romagna) and the Southern Italy regions (i.e. Calabria)

454

where the peak is not reached yet, and therefore the fitting curves are still unconstrained and the

455

future trends very uncertain. These results, based on the trend of the number of casualties, further

456

confirm that the infection data we record today are only dependent on the variable and

457

inhomogeneous sampling and have nothing to do with the true statistical evolution of the epidemic.

458

Looking at these very inhomogeneous data, it is very clear that, since several days, the increase or

459

decrease of new daily infections just depend on the number of tests. This is an obvious consequence

460

of the fact, demonstrated here, that the true number of infections is much larger than the small

461

sample tested: so, more tests you do, more cases you record. The information that the epidemic in

462

the whole Italy is reaching the saturation (and hopefully end, as forecasted, within the first half of

463

April), although not apparent from the tested number of new infections, should be seriously

464

considered in order to decide how to tune and eventually release the next measures for the

465

containment of the infection.

466
467

Conclusions

468
469

We analysed the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy, which showed to be the largest and most lethal in the

470

world. We discussed the causes of such anomalous behaviour of the disease in Italy, where

471

mortality appears much higher than in other countries. Among the various hypotheses made till now

472

to explain such an anomalous behaviour, it appears that neither the old age of population, nor the

473

observed antibiotic-resistance of population (by far the highest one in Europe), nor even the
14

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243; this version posted April 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

474

smoking level, should have significant effects on the observed mortality. The most reasonable effect

475

would involve a strong underestimation of the extension of the infection (implying a factor 8.7 to

476

56.5 more cases than the tested ones). A possible, further contribution could be given by the very

477

high fine powder (and Ozone) pollution (one of the highest ones in Europe), which on one hand

478

could facilitate the virus transmission, on the other hand could make more vulnerable and stressed

479

the lung, causing heavier damages upon impact with virus. Another factor emerging from our

480

analyses (as well as from media) that likely amplified mortality, could have been the scarse

481

preparedness and possible initial faults of the sanitary system, mainly in Lombardia where the

482

epidemic first blew up in few days.

483

The problem of underestimation of the number of infections, coupled with a non homogeneous

484

sampling and testing of the positive cases, makes these data unreliable to use for statistics aimed to

485

forecast the epidemic evolution. We then use here the cumulative daily number of deceases,

486

corrected for an appropriate IFR, to simulate the evolution of the epidemic by a logistic function.

487

When corrected for IFR and time shift between infection and death, these data can be well fitted by

488

a logistic function, and show that actually the peak of infection has been overcome more than two

489

weeks ago, and the saturation of the curve (end of epidemic) is expected within the first week of

490

April or few days later. For the Southern Italy regions, the saturation of the curve will be most-

491

likely delayed of a few days. The information here obtained about the possible evolution of the

492

epidemic and its likely end, which is not at all evident from the very inhomogeneous sampling of

493

infections actually performed, should be seriously considered in order to decide what measures to

494

undertake or relax in the next future. Moreover, considering the likely effectiveness of the school’s

495

closure, which is probably the minimally invasive measure in a social and economic sense, it should

496

be considered as a primary measure when the lockdown will end. The study of this unprecedented

497

medical catastrophe will hopefully give robust indications to avoid, in the future, the same errors

498

and understatements. It will also help to seriously consider the need to improve health system both

499

in hospital and primary health care settings, whose capability should be considered invaluable, also

500

using a purely economic criterion.
