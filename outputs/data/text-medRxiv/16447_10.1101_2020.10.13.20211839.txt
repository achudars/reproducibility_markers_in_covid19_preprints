Abstract

We investigate the role of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in public spaces. Direct
measurement of aerosol concentrations however has proven technically difficult; we propose
the use of handheld particle counters as a novel and easily applicable method to measure
aerosol concentrations. This allow us to perform measurements in typical public spaces, each
differing in volume, number of people and ventilation rate. These data are used to estimate the
relation between aerosol persistence time and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The World Health Organization has in its recent Scientific Brief1 highlighted the possible role
of aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-21-4 and stated that ‘much more research is
needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission’1. This is particularly
relevant for public spaces where the risk of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is highest.
Direct measurement of aerosol concentrations however has proven technically difficult5,
hampering such research. We validate the use of handheld particle counters as a novel and
easily applicable method to measure aerosol concentrations.
To demonstrate the usefulness of our novel method, we perform measurements in typical public
spaces that can play a role in aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, each differing in volume,
number of people and ventilation rate. These data are used to estimate the relation between
aerosol persistence time and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

Aerosol concentration is often measured using a laser sheet diffraction technique, in which the
number of pixels that light up is a measure for the number and volume of the droplets.4
However, this technique can only be operated by highly specialized personnel and, because of
laser safety issues, only in laboratory settings. Using this technique as the standard, we validate
a novel method using a handheld particle counter (Fluke 985, Fluke B.V. Europe, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands) which is frequently used for air quality assessment and overcomes most of
the above-mentioned drawbacks of the laser sheet diffraction technique. For each
measurement, the aerosol concentration is determined by correcting for the background
(measured for ~8 minutes), consisting of dust particles.

Validation

First, we validate the novel method by comparing the results with those obtained previously
using the laser diffraction technique4. The validation scenario is that of a single person
coughing once inside a poorly ventilated restroom of volume 8 m3. The results for both
techniques are shown in Fig. 1. We find that coughing leads to the generation of an amount of
aerosol particles an order of magnitude above the background level of the particle counter; both
techniques next reveal that the number of aerosols per liter of air decreases exponentially in
time, with a time constant of ~4 minutes (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the size distribution of the
particles as obtained by the two techniques. The comparison is more difficult here, as the
handheld particle counter has less channels to separate ranges of particles sizes as the laser
sheet diffraction technique; however, the results are not incompatible. We also find that the
results obtained using the handheld particle counter were reproducible to within 10%. We
conclude that the particle counter technique is indeed a reliable method to determine aerosol
concentrations as a function of time, as well to give a rough indication of the size distribution
of droplets.

Application to public spaces

We now use the technique to characterize a wide range of real-world public spaces, each
selected as a typical example of a certain type of public space (Table 1). In these public spaces,
we measure all aerosols resulting from breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing by people
present (1 to 25 at the time of the measurements). Background measurements indicate that
dust generated by the people moving around is mostly (>98%) contained in the first two
channels of the particle counter (diameters between 0.3 and 0.5 micrometer), out of the range

of the characteristic diameter of aerosols produced by breathing, speaking, coughing and
sneezing4. They are therefore not considered when evaluating the aerosol density. Separate
from the measurements involving multiple people producing aerosols, we also investigate the
decrease in aerosol concentration over time by generating a known quantity of artificial
aerosols using a specially designed spray nozzle as used in [4], which is known to produce
aerosols of the same size distribution as respiratory droplets resulting from coughing (i.e.,
between 1-10 micrometer with a maximum at 4 micrometer). In Table 1 we summarize the
results, indicating the number of people involved, the air change rate per hour (ACH) of the
ventilation system used, and the measured droplet concentration half-times.
In the public spaces investigated by us, aerosol concentrations are approximately 20 to more
than a 100 times lower in all ventilated public spaces compared to the poorly ventilated
restroom used for the calibration measurements. Also in a public elevator and in a poorly
ventilated living room, aerosol concentrations are high. The characteristic times for a 50%
decrease in aerosol concentration are on the order of one minute in well-ventilated spaces,
compared to 4-5 minutes in the poorly ventilated restroom, elevator and living room.. This is
due to both the air renewal (given by the ACH) and further dilution by dispersion throughout
the space, and therefore depends both on the ACH and the absolute size of the given space
(Table 1).

Discussion

This study shows that the particle counter technique is a reliable method to investigate aerosols
concentrations and their evolution in time. Using this easily applicable method, aerosol
concentrations can be measured in any public space which is important to determine the risk

of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to evaluate the impact of risk reducing measures
(i.e. improving ventilation).
Aerosol persistence times in the tested spaces are relatively short due to adequate space
ventilation. Current standards for the air change rate by mechanical room ventilation vary
between 4-20 air changes per hour. An air change rate of 10 times per hour means that every 6
minutes the given space has received fresh air of a volume similar to that of the spaceOur
measurements of aerosol persistence suggest that a half-life of the aerosol concentration of one
or two minutes minimizes the aerosol concentration, and is achieved for air change rates in
excess of 10 air changes/hour . Using the half-times as measured by us, we calculate that the
decrease in the number of aerosol particles after these 6 minutes will vary between 50 and
100%, depending on the ventilation method and the size of the public space.
When translating our findings to practical risk assessments in the context of SARS-CoV-2
transmission by aerosols, we conclude that the risk of transmission via airborne aerosols is low
in all but the restroom scenario. The reason for this is twofold: first, good ventilation
significantly decreases the density of aerosols in a short time (Table 1). Second, the number of
viral particles in the very small aerosol drops is low. Sputum droplets from COVID-19 patients
carry typically between 104 -109 RNA copies per ml5. This implies between 0.001 and 100
RNA copies per thousand aerosol drops6,7. The minimum infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 has
not been reported; the severity of COVID-19 is however believed to be proportional to the dose
of the initial inoculum, implying that transmission by aerosols may lead to relatively milder
symptoms6,7. In our risk analysis we assume that exposure to less than 103 microdroplets
(corresponding to less than 100 RNA copies) imposes a low risk, between 103 and 105
microdroplets (corresponding to 100 - 10.000 RNA copies) an intermediate risk, and more than
105 micro droplets (corresponding to more than 10.000 RNA copies) a high risk of
transmission6,7. Further research on the transmissibility of the virus is needed to validate this

assumption and possibly correct these risk values. Our measurements together with the risk
analysis however underlines the importance of good ventilation, and suggests that health
authorities can advise a minimal ventilation rate to minimize the probability of SARS-CoV-2
transmission in public spaces.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates a novel aerosol measurement method that is easily implemented in
different environments. With reasonable assumptions on the viral load and infectivity, this
allows for a rough estimate of the probability of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2
following [6,7]. To reduce the spread of such infections, healthcare authorities should consider
this method to evaluate the ventilation of public spaces, especially in spaces where
aerosolization is common such as hospital and dentistry settings.

Table 1: Aerosol concentrations and persistence times in different public spaces characterized by the number of people
present, volume and rate of ventilation. In all but the club scenario where aerosols where artificially generated, the aerosol
origin is from persons speaking, coughing and sneezing. Spaces were sampled that gave us permission to do so- these were
mainly well-ventilated spaces in modern buildings. Each space was typically sampled in 5 different places.
