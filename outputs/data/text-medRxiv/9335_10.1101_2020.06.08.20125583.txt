Abstract. In order to recover the damage to the economy by the ongoing covid–19 pandemic, many countries consider the transition from strict lockdowns to partial lockdowns
through relaxation of preventive measures. In this work, we propose an optimal lockdown
relaxation strategy, which is aimed at minimizing the damage to the economy, while confining the covid–19 incidence to a level endurable by the available healthcare facilities in the
country. In order to capture the transmission dynamics, we adopt the compartment models
and develop the relevant optimization model, which turns out to be non–linear. We generate
approximate solutions to the problem, whereas our experimentation is based on the data on
the covid–19 outbreak in Sri Lanka.

Introduction

The ongoing pandemic of the covid–19, which has recently been declared by the
World Health Organization as the era–defining global health crisis [16], is an unprecedented threat to the world. It has caused numerous deaths and health complications, upended the day–to–day life and destabilized economies.
On 23rd January, 2020 the State Council of Wuhan issued the first order to
lockdown the first pandemic epicenter to control the spread of the virus to the
other parts of the country [26]. However, the virus quickly spread throughout the
globe within the first two months of 2020. In the absence of established measures
to control the transmission of covid–19, at least 186 countries have implemented
various strategies including social distancing and restrictions on human movement
to slow down the spread of the disease [10] and to prevent healthcare systems from
becoming overwhelmed. For instance, as the first European country to be massively
affected, Italy issued a lockdown order in a cluster of cities in Lombardy and Veneto
regions on 22nd February, 2020 and it was further expanded to 15 provinces on
8th March; subsequently imposed a nationwide lockdown on 12th March [21]. The
government of Philippines issued a lockdown order in the form of an enhanced
community quarantine on 12th March, 2020 [20]. The government of France too
declared a mandatory home confinement for 15 days starting from 17th March, 2020
which was extended up to 30 days and lifted on 11th May, 2020 [13]. The government
of India declared a countrywide lockdown for 21 days on 24th March, 2020; but
further extended up to 3rd May, 2020 [14] as the number of covid–19 cases increased.
Though lockdown and other control strategies had been able to control the spread
of the disease and saved many lives, most of the countries experienced considerable

socio–economic damages during the lockdown period. For instance, the collapse of
markets, employee layoffs, disruptions of the food supply and impacts on education
system can be highlighted [2,15,19]. To overcome these situations many countries
gradually lifted the strict lockdowns. However, the consequence was another epidemic wave. For an example, after the lockdown relaxation on 3rd May 2020, India
is witnessing a steep rise in the number of reported covid–19 cases as shown in
Figure 1.

Figures 2 and 3 clearly illustrate that Italy and France are experiencing the
second phase of pandemic after the lockdown relaxation. From Figure 3, it can be
observed that France continues to report the highest number of new covid–19 cases
after the lockdown is lifted. During the second phase of pandemic, countries have
largely avoided imposing nationwide lockdowns and are instead relying on partial
lockdowns and targeted restrictions on movement in hot spots.
In this context, it is important to seek what preventive measures are most appropriate to keep the pandemic controlled, while causing the minimum damage to the
economy of the country. In other words, it is important to design successful partial

lockdown strategies, or, lockdown relaxation strategies, by taking into account the
transmission of the disease when travel is permitted and also the economic concerns.
We propose a region–based lockdown relaxation strategy, which shares certain
similarities with what was implemented during the lockdown period in several countries. Accordingly, we propose to determine the extent of lockdown a region must
undergo, in order to limit the number of covid–19 patients to a number that can
be provided necessary healthcare facilities using the current capacity in the country.
It is a well known fact that the death rate from covid–19 rapidly increases when
a country is unable to provide intensive care unit (ICU) beds and other necessary
health facilities to the patients. Therefore, we assume that the country can reinforce
a certain number of patients, during a given time. Also we consider the transmission
dynamics of covid–19 from available data. Thus, we build an optimization model
which determines the extent of lockdown that must be imposed on a region during
the post–lockdown period.
In order to obtain computational results from the optimization model developed
thus, we use the covid-19 data in Sri Lanka, where strict and mild lockdowns were
implemented at several occasions. In order to enhance the computational experience, we describe the covid–19 situation in Sri Lanka in section 2. In section 3 we
forecast the post–lockdown transmission of covid–19 using compartment models in
epidemiology, by incorporating the inter–regional mobility factor. In section 4 we
develop the optimization model. Section 5 includes our computational techniques
and section 6 the interpretation and the discussion of the results we obtained. We
conclude the paper in section 7.

Lockdown strategies in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka reported the first covid–19 case in a Chinese tourist on 27th January 2020
and subsequently in a local person on 11th March, 2020. Aimed at controlling the
pandemic, the government of Sri Lanka implemented several strategies, of which
reducing human mobility was the most prominent one [8]. A strict strategy of lockdown was enforced together with other preventive measures including case detection,
identification of contacts, quarantine, travel restrictions and isolation of small villages as well. Despite those preventive measures, the pandemic continues to threaten

the public with daily reported cases. As seen from Figure 4, the reported covid–19
cases in Sri Lanka is still on the rise thus the country is still at risk. Further, Sri
Lanka has experienced fluctuating doubling times below 70, as depicted in Figure 5,
which questions the appropriateness of relaxations. On the other hand, the impact

of the preventive measures to the economy of Sri Lanka was significant. Sri Lankan
economy was slowly recovering from the Easter Sunday attacks in April 2019, and
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) was expecting an economic growth of 4.5–5%
together with the political stability after the recently held presidential and general
elections. In this context, a continuing lockdown was regarded as quite impossible
for the small island nation. Therefore, the government of Sri Lanka declared that the
activities of the country will be restarted from 11th May onwards, subject to several

restrictions, aimed at a resuming to ordinary life gradually. The restrictions include
social distancing, limitation of the workforce at workplaces etc. Also the nationwide
curfew imposed for 52 days was lifted for many regions, except for several regions
identified as high–risk zones. A limited number of citizens in high–risk zones were
allowed to travel, based on the last digit of their national identity card numbers.
Accordingly, specific days are prescribed for the individuals who possess national
identity card numbers ending up at different digits, intending to reduce the human
movement inside those zones by more than 80%. In addition, one third of the workforce in state institutions in several areas were required to report to work. Also the
public transport services were made allowed with strict restrictions on the numbers
of passengers. Thus, the country had undergone a transition from strict lockdowns
towards partial lockdowns.
It must be noted that even when the strict lockdowns were implemented in
the country’s most populous Western province and the high–risk North Western
province, partial lockdowns were implemented in several other provinces. For instance, human mobility in the North Central province which contributes most to
agriculture was least restricted, a decision which helped the minimally interrupted
distribution of rice and vegetables to the regions on which strict curfew was imposed.
Also, the manufacturing industries were permitted to operate to a certain extent,
prioritizing food and beverages. This was done by allowing a certain percentage of
workers at food manufacturing industry to go to work in some regions, subject to
strict measures on distancing. Moreover, temporary relaxations of curfew were exercised in several regions at different occasions. Therefore, the country has already
undergone partial lockdowns, where different regions were operated to different extents, eventually contributing to the sustainment of the nation’s economy during the
lockdowns. It must be noted that the country underwent partial lockdowns at several times, most recently after the identification of the cluster that exceeded 1000
positive cases from an apparel factory in the Western Province in early October
2020.
Nevertheless, the days of lockdown should not be seen as identical to the new
post–lockdown period. A major distinction of the new period from the lockdown
days is the inter–regional travel which was allowed from 11th May onwards. Recall
the major control measure for covid–19 was strictly restricting the human movement
inside the country, its relaxation must have unforeseen consequences. Several previous works on epidemiology have pointed out the significance of human mobility to
the transmission of covid–19 [9,24]. Therefore, the relaxation of travel restrictions
must put a different complexion on the matter, making the post–lockdown period
significantly different to the lockdown period.

Post–lockdown disease transmission

In order to model the disease transmission in the country that undergoes a lockdown
(or a relaxation), we adopt the SIR (susceptible–infectious–recovered) model for
epidemic transmission, which is the most frequently used compartment model to
forecast an epidemic. This model captures the transmission dynamics of diseases
of which the infection confers permanent immunity. The population (N ) is divided
into the three disjoint classes, namely, susceptible (S), infectious (I) and recovered

(R). Once the susceptible individuals become infected with the disease, they move
to the infectious class. The infected persons move to the recovered class when they
get recovered from the disease and a person in the recovered class is assumed to have
permanent immunity. Let β denote the transmission rate from infected individuals
to susceptible individuals and γ denote the recovery rate of infected individuals.
Then, the timely variation of the compartments is described by the following set of
differential equations:

Several researchers have used the SIR model to forecast the covid–19 incidence
[3,5,23]. The SIR model in its original form is however not very helpful for our
purpose. Recall inter–provincial travel is the main characteristic which distinguishes
the post–lockdown period in our context, in order to forecast the transmission during
that period, it is essential to incorporate the travel component to the conventional
SIR model. Hence, we modify the SIR as follows.
Let wij denote the percentage of daily travels from ith province to the jth
province and degree of social distancing respectively. Let xi denote the lockdown
relaxation percentage of the i th province. Then the susceptible (Si ), infectious (Ii ),
recovered (Ri ) populations in ith province can be described by the following set of
modified differential equations.

Proposed optimization model

Several works have investigated the critical subject of intensive care management
during covid–19 pandemic with different opinions [7,22,28], which we do not wish
to explore in this work. Determining who would be provided with ICU facilities
is another decision problem we do not wish to address in this work. Instead, we
consider a situation where all patients are provided ICU beds. If the epidemiological
recommendations suggest otherwise, this assumption can be readily relaxed and the
relevant term can be replaced by the percentage of the infected population who are
facilitated with ICU beds. Accordingly, we state the condition that the number of
covid–19 patients in the post–lockdown era, which is given by Equation 7 must not
exceed the number of ICU beds.
Once the transmission of the disease to different provinces during the post–
lockdown period is formulated, it is now important to examine the contribution of
these provinces to the economy. Recall the decisions on curfew were made at different
notes on different regions during the 52 days of lockdown, a primary intention was
sustaining the nationwide economy by considering the economic contribution from
regions. Our model is also based on the regular (or the pre–lockdown) economic
contribution by different provinces. For this purpose, we use the data in Sri Lanka,
which is given in Table 1.
Since our intention is determining to what extent a province would operate during
the post–lockdown era, the decision variable in our optimization model must be the
extent of lockdown relaxation of the ith province, given as a percentage, symbolized
by xi in section 3. Then the inputs follow as given below.

The objective function 8 maximizes the total contribution to the economy by all
provinces. Constraint 9a assures that the number of total infected persons within
the relevant period of time does not exceed the number of ICU beds in the country.
The inter–regional transmission of the disease as obtained by applying the SIR
model is given by the set of constraints in 9b. Finally, constraints in 9c assure that
the percentage of lockdown of any province must be between 0% and 100%.

In order to solve the non–linear optimization problem given by Equations 8 and 9,
we consider a particular characteristic of the objective function 8 and constraints 9a,

of single–variabled functions. Also the Rconstraint 9c is readily transformable to this

This reformulation given by Equations 10 and 11 motivates us to adopt the technique
of separable programming. This technique was first introduced in [6] for constrained
optimization of non–linear convex functions, whenever these functions are separable;
that is, expressible as sums of functions of single variable. Since its inception, separable programming has been a very useful optimization technique, with applications to
several real–world problems including agricultural planning [27], linear complementarity problem [4], Newsboy problem [1] and demand allocation [11]. The main tool
in separable programming is, replacing the non–linear functions in the optimization
problem by piecewise linear approximations.
Notice that Equation 11d in our formulation is non–linear and hence piecewise
linearization is required for the function fi . We divide the domain of fi , that is
[0, Di ], into n subdivisions, each of length d by defining hik as follows, where, Di is
the maximum value of hi .
0 = hi1 ≤ hi2 ≤ · · · ≤ hin = Di ,

(12)

hik − hi(k+1) = d, ∀k ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.

(13)

where
Then any point hi in the interval [0, Di ] can be uniquely expressed as:
hi = λik hik + λi(k+1) hi(k+1) ,

(14)

λik + λi(k+1) = 1 and λik , λi(k+1) ≥ 0.

method. It is a standard fact in separable programming that, in case of maximization, if the approximated objective function is concave and each piecewise linear
constraint is convex, then the solution of the linearly approximated formulation
without the additional restriction is feasible to the original problem [12,25]. From
this, the computational hardness implied by the non–linearity could be readily overcome, and the problem becomes efficiently solvable.

Results

Based on the information available on covid–19 pandemic in Sri Lanka, we made
substitutions of numerical values to the inputs. First, Sri Lanka currently has approximately 500 ICU beds, and the authorities have recently declared their willingness
to increase this to 1000. Therefore, the input M was set to 1000 in our primary
computational experiment. Further, the covid–19 incidence by province as per 11th
May were taken as the initial conditions. This selection of initial condition is a realistic choice required by the model, as it is the day the country started undergoing
relaxations. Provincial economic contribution was substituted as in Table 1. The
duration the model applied was taken as one week from the day the relaxations
started.
The global optimum to the problem achieved through separable programming,
applied to these data, provided the best relaxation percentages of the provinces,
as given by Table 2 and visualized in Figure 6. There are several interesting and
counterintuitive implications. According to these results, no relaxation must be done
on the lockdown of the Western province; moreover, it is not the only province which
must be kept at strict lockdowns; also the Central and the North Western provinces
must undergo strict lockdowns. On the other hand, total relaxation is possible for five
provinces, namely, Southern, Northern, Eastern, North Central and Uva. Recall the
North Central province, the country’s agricultural hub, underwent least lockdown
measures till 11th May to assure the people are provided with rice and vegetables, our
results too indicate that the agricultural farming can be restarted in this province
and its economic centres could be kept open during the post–lockdown period.

Our secondary computational experiment was on investigating the scenario when
different numbers of ICU beds are available. The results are shown in Figure 7.
Recall Sri Lanka currently has 500 ICU beds in state hospitals, the results indicate
that relaxations must be applied only to three provinces, namely, Southern, Eastern
and North Central. The Northern province also could undergo a minor relaxation, if
the number is increased to 750, in addition to the significant fact that Uva province
might undergo a major relaxation. The lockdown imposed on the Central province
can be partly relaxed at a stage when the number of ICU beds is in between 1000
and 1250. Sabaragamuwa province could undergo a partial relaxation when this
number is between 750 and 100. Western and North Western provinces must remain
unrelaxed even if the number is increased to 2000.

Conclusion

Human mobility is a critical factor in transmitting communicable diseases. Accordingly, lockdowns with strict travel restrictions were implemented in several countries
to fight against the covid–19 pandemic. A nationwide curfew was implemented in
several countries including Sri Lanka and India, which had a significant impact on
the economy. Since minimizing both covid–19 incidence and economic effects are two
conflicting goals, resuming to economic activities is inescapable. Therefore, countries
consider partial lockdowns, aimed at a gradual transition to ordinary life. Instead
of ad–hoc lockdown or relaxation strategies, in this work we proposed a systematic
lockdown relaxation strategy that can help in achieving the two conflicting goals.
Considering the potential disease transmission during the post–lockdown period,
as given by the epidemic models, we proposed an optimization model, from which

the optimal region–based lockdown strategies were determined, while confining the
covid–19 incidence to a number that is endurable to the country and minimizing
the damage to its economy. In particular, we proposed to determine the extent of
lockdown relaxation for each region such that all covid–19 patients could be provided
ICU facilities and the contribution to economy by all provinces is maximized. Since
the resulting optimization problem turned out to be non–linear and several of its
functions were expressible as sums of single–variabled functions, we adopted the
method of separable programming to generate solutions for the relevant data sets
in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, we converted the non–linear functions to piecewise linear
approximations and found the global optimum.
In a more realistic setting, other constraints must be added to our model. For
instance, it was mentioned in section 2 that during the lockdown period, the North
Central province which acts as the agricultural hub in Sri Lanka underwent least
lockdown restrictions. If all agrarian activities must be continued in the post–
lockdown period, the relevant constraint can be readily incorporated into our model,
as a lower bound to the relaxation of this province. That adds another linear, single–
variabled and convex constraint which does not change the solution criterion. However, if the government is looking forward to running different specific industries
in different regions, our model needs further modifications. In that case, a decision
variable could be indexed by two indices, one for the province and the other for the
industry. Further, our model can be applied at any moment in the post–lockdown
period by substituting relevant initial conditions. In addition, even if travel restrictions were reimposed on certain roads, the relevant input can be changed and the
updated optimal lockdown levels could be determined by minimum modifications.
Due to concavity and convexity of the objective functions and constrains, it is efficiently solvable, even if the inter–provincial mobility information were replaced by

a subtler dataset such as inter–district mobility; which could be a significant improvement of our model in light of accuracy. Accordingly, our optimization model
can be improved further to help the decision making process in sustaining the economy in post–lockdown times, preventing the excessive transmission of covid–19. It
would be an interesting future research task to formulate an analogous optimization
problem, in which the factors that integrate the individual economic contribution
by provinces are included.
