ABSTRACT
Rationale: Smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at
increased risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objectives: We investigated the expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 in lung tissue
from never smokers and smokers with and without COPD.
Methods: In a cross-sectional, observational study we measured mRNA expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 by RT-PCR in lung tissue samples from 120 well phenotyped subjects. Next,
protein levels of ACE2 were visualized by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from 87
subjects and quantified in alveolar and bronchial epithelium. Finally, primary human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBECs) were cultured at air liquid interface and exposed to air or cigarette
smoke.
Results: ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lung tissue from current smokers
and subjects with moderate to very severe COPD and correlated with physiological parameters
of airway obstruction and emphysema. Pulmonary expression levels of TMPRSS2 were
significantly higher in patients with (very) severe COPD and correlated significantly with
ACE2 expression. Importantly, protein levels of ACE2 were elevated in both alveolar and
bronchial epithelium of current smokers and subjects with moderate to very severe COPD.
Finally, TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increased in in vitro cultured HBECs upon acute
exposure to cigarette smoke.
Conclusions: We demonstrate increased expression of ACE2 in lungs of smokers and COPD
subjects, which might facilitate host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. These findings help identifying
populations at risk for severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel emerging respiratory disease caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is causing a vast
pandemic with huge medical, social, personal and financial impact. The virus first appeared in
Wuhan, China and rapidly spread across the rest of the world, making COVID-19 the third
large-scale pandemic caused by coronaviruses after SARS in 2002 and Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) in 2012 [1, 2]. The clinical course of the disease ranges from an
asymptomatic course to progressive respiratory failure with need for ventilatory support and
even death [1].
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the cell entry receptor used by
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [1, 3]. ACE2 is a metallopeptidase I and a homologue of the
ACE-receptor. Although both receptors play important roles in the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS), they have profoundly different roles. Whereas ACE converts
angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent vasoconstrictor, ACE2 converts both
Ang I and Ang II to Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7) respectively, thereby counteracting the effects of
ACE and Ang II [4, 5]. Expression of ACE2 was shown in various cells and tissues, including
alveolar type II cells and bronchial epithelial cells, as well as in the oral cavity, oesophagus,
heart, kidney, and ileum [6]. In addition, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was
identified as the host cell protease used by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming, which is an
essential part of the viral entry process [7].
Although SARS-CoV-2 can infect any individual, most severe cases are reported in those with
comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) [2, 8-10]. COPD is a highly prevalent chronic respiratory disease, characterized by an
abnormal inflammatory response to cigarette smoke [11]. Importantly, both smokers and
patients with COPD are at increased risk for severe complications and a higher mortality upon

SARS-CoV-2 infection [12, 13]. Whether this is due to an increased expression of ACE2 in the
lungs, and more specifically in the alveolar tissue where pneumonia occurs in severe COVID19, needs thorough investigation. A recent paper reported increased ACE2 expression in
bronchial brushings and airway epithelia of current smokers and patients with COPD, compared
to healthy controls [14]. Previous work done by our group, showed upregulation of dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4), the viral entry receptor for the MERS coronavirus, in alveolar tissue of
smokers and patients with COPD [15].
We hypothesized that the increased risk for a more severe course of COVID-19 in smokers and
patients with COPD is due to an increased expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2
in the lung. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression of ACE2, as well as the host cell
protease TMPRSS2, in a large number of lung tissue specimens of well phenotyped subjects,
including never smokers and smokers with and without airflow limitation. We quantified ACE2
and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in the lung, as well as ACE2 protein levels in both alveolar
and bronchial epithelium. Next, we investigated the independent determinants of pulmonary
ACE2 expression by linear regression analysis. Finally, we determined mRNA expression of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cigarette smoke-exposed primary human bronchial epithelial cells.

METHODS
Methodological details are available in the online data supplement. Study design, hypothesis,
methods, analyses, and findings are reported according to the STROBE checklist for crosssectional studies [16, 17].

Human lung tissue samples
In this cross-sectional, observational study, we analyzed lung tissue specimens from a total of
134 subjects: 106 lung samples from our large lung tissue biobank at Ghent University Hospital
(collected from lung resections for solitary pulmonary tumors and currently encompassing 360
subjects) and 28 samples from explant lungs from end-stage COPD patients collected at UZ
Gasthuisberg Leuven, Belgium. All lung samples were collected between January 2002 and
February 2020, before the first reported case of COVID-19 in Belgium. A flow-chart illustrating
the selection of lung samples for RT-PCR (n=120) and immunohistochemical (n=87) analyses
is shown in Figure E1. Based on medical history, smoking history, questionnaires and preoperative spirometry, patients were categorized as never-smokers with normal lung function,
smokers without airflow limitation or subjects with COPD. Subjects were considered exsmokers when they had quitted smoking for more than 1 year. COPD severity was defined
according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification.
None of the patients were treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Lung tissue of patients
diagnosed with solitary pulmonary tumors was obtained at a maximum distance from the
pulmonary lesions and without signs of retro-obstructive pneumonia or tumor invasion and
collected by a pathologist. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study
was approved by the medical ethical committees of the Ghent University Hospital (2011/0114;
2016/0132; 2019/0537) and the University Hospital Gasthuisberg Leuven (S51577).

Culture of human bronchial epithelial cells
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were isolated by enzymatic digestion from
lung resection specimens derived from 6 donors (1 non-COPD and 5 COPD GOLD stage II or
III) during surgery for lung cancer, as described previously [18]. After a 14-day ALI culture
period, cells were exposed to mainstream cigarette smoke or air, as described previously, and
harvested after 3, 6 or 24 hours [19].

RNA extraction and real-time PCR-analysis
RNA extraction from lung tissue blocks of 120 subjects (including 28 never-smokers, 36
smokers without airflow limitation, 42 patients with COPD GOLD II and 14 patients with
COPD GOLD III-IV, see Table 1 for patient characteristics), as well as from the ALI cultured
HBECs, was performed with the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), between 2015
and 2020. Next, cDNA was prepared with the EvoScript Universal cDNA Master Kit (Roche)
in March 2020, followed by RT-PCR analysis for ACE2, TMPRSS2 and 3 reference genes as
described previously [20, 21].

ACE2 immunohistochemistry
Sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded lung tissue blocks of 87 subjects (including 20
never-smokers, 24 smokers without COPD, 29 subjects with COPD GOLD II and 14 subjects
with COPD GOLD III-IV, see supplementary Table E1 for patient characteristics) were stained
for ACE2 in March and April 2020. After antigen retrieval with citrate buffer (Scytek), the
slides were incubated with anti-ACE2 antibody (polyclonal rabbit-anti-human, Abcam
ab15248). Next, slides were colored with diaminobenzidine (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA). The isotype
control was rabbit IgG (R&D systems, AB-150-C).

Quantification of ACE2 in alveolar tissue and airway epithelium
Quantitative measurements of the ACE2-positive signal in alveolar tissue and bronchial
epithelium was performed on images of stained paraffin sections as described previously [15].
A detailed description of the methods can be found in the online supplement. Briefly, to
quantify the amount of ACE2-positive signal in alveolar tissue, 10 images of alveolar tissue
(not containing airways or blood vessels) were recorded from an average of 3 tissue blocks per
patient. The area of brown ACE2-positive staining was measured and normalized to the total
area of alveolar tissue present in each image. Additionally, the number of ACE2-positive cells
was manually counted in each image and again normalized to the total area of alveolar tissue.
To quantify the amount of ACE2-positive signal in airway epithelium, images of airways were
recorded from an average of 3 tissue blocks per patient. The amount of ACE2-positive signal
was measured only in the airway epithelial layer and normalized to the length of the basement
membrane (Pbm). The number of airways per patient was between 3 and 20.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Stat software (SPSS 26.0, Chicago, IL, USA)
and R3.5.1, using Student’s t-test, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher’s exact
test, Spearman’s Rank correlations, and multivariate linear regression analyses. Additional
details and covariates for the regression analyses are described in the online supplement.
Characteristics of the study population are presented as median (interquartile range).
Differences at p-values < 0.05 were considered to be significant (*P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***
P<0.001).

RESULTS
ACE2 mRNA expression is increased in lung tissue of smokers and COPD subjects.
Using real time quantitative PCR, ACE2 mRNA levels were determined in lung tissue from
120 subjects. Lung tissue from 20 never smokers, 36 smokers without airflow limitation
(including 22 current smokers and 14 ex-smokers) and 42 patients with COPD GOLD stage II
(including 28 current smokers and 14 ex-smokers) was derived from lobectomy specimens,
whereas tissue from 14 subjects with COPD GOLD stage III-IV was derived from explant lungs
after lung transplantation. Demographic and clinical patient characteristics are described in
Table 1.
ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lung tissue of current smokers without
airflow limitation, current smokers with COPD GOLD stage II, and smokers with COPD
GOLD stage III-IV, compared to never smokers (Figure 1A). In addition, ex-smokers without
airflow limitation showed significantly lower ACE2 mRNA levels, compared to current
smokers.
Furthermore, pulmonary ACE2 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with the severity
of airflow limitation (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) %
predicted and the ratio of FEV1 to the forced vital capacity (FVC)) and with the diffusing
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO and KCO), markers of emphysema (Figure 1CF).
TMPRSS2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lung tissue of patients with COPD
GOLD stage III-IV, compared to never smokers, smokers without airflow limitation and
patients with COPD GOLD stage II (Figure 1B). Moreover, there was a significant positive
correlation between pulmonary TMRPSS2 mRNA expression and ACE2 mRNA expression,
even after excluding the high TMPRSS2 expressing GOLD stage III-IV patients (Figure 1G).

ACE2 protein levels are increased in alveolar tissue and bronchial epithelium of smokers
and COPD subjects.
By immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, ACE2 protein levels were assessed in lung tissue
from 87 subjects: 20 never smokers, 24 smokers without COPD (15 current smokers and 9 exsmokers), 29 patients with COPD GOLD stage II (20 current smokers and 9 ex-smokers) and
14 smokers with COPD GOLD stage III-IV. Patient characteristics are described in
supplementary Table E1.
ACE2 IHC revealed positive staining in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells (Figure 2),
with the latter predominantly in alveolar type II cells.
Quantification of ACE2 protein levels in alveolar tissue revealed a significantly higher
percentage of ACE2-positive alveolar tissue in current smokers without airflow limitation,
current smokers with COPD GOLD II, and patients with COPD GOLD III-IV, compared to
never smokers (Figure 3A-E). Moreover, the percentage of ACE2-positive alveolar tissue was
significantly higher in patients with COPD GOLD III-IV, compared to ex-smokers without
airflow limitation and ex-smokers with COPD GOLD II (Figure 3E). Additionally,
quantification of the number of ACE2 positive cells in the alveolar epithelium showed a similar
increase in current smokers and subjects with COPD (GOLD stages II and III-IV), which
reached significance only in (very) severe COPD patients (Figure E2).
Quantification of ACE2 staining in bronchial epithelium revealed numerically higher levels in
current smokers without airflow limitation and current smokers with COPD GOLD II, and
significantly higher levels in patients with COPD GOLD III-IV, compared to never smokers
(Figure 4A-E). Moreover, ACE2 protein levels in bronchial epithelium were significantly
higher in patients with COPD GOLD III-IV, compared to ex-smokers without airflow limitation
and ex-smokers with COPD GOLD II (Figure 4E).

Smoking, COPD, medication use, comorbidities, and lung-specific expression of ACE2
We investigated whether the increased ACE2 levels in subjects with COPD could partially
result from cigarette smoking. Although the effect size for the association between COPD and
pulmonary ACE2 mRNA expression was affected after adjusting for smoking status in linear
regression analyses (unadjusted β 0.28 ± 0.09, p = 0.002; smoke status adjusted β 0.22 ± 0.10,
p = 0.036), the association remained statistically significant. Secondly, we tested whether the
association between COPD and pulmonary ACE2 mRNA could be confounded by
comorbidities or intake of RAAS-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARB)). Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that current smoking (β 0.20 ±
0.09, p = 0.023) and COPD (β 0.31 ± 0.09, p = 0.001) are both independently associated with
increased ACE2 mRNA expression in lung tissue, even after adjustment for covariates
including age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and use of RAAS-inhibitors (Figure 5A). Similar
findings were observed for the association between COPD and ACE2 protein expression in
alveolar tissue (Figure 5B) or bronchial epithelium and (Figure E3). Notably, in these models,
diabetes mellitus seemed to be significantly associated with increased ACE2 levels in alveolar
tissue and bronchial epithelium.
ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in lung tissue of subjects using oral
corticosteroid (OCS), but not in lung tissue of subjects using inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
(Figure E4). To test whether increased ACE2 mRNA levels in OCS users may be partially due
to underlying COPD, we performed linear regression analyses. Indeed, the significant age- and
sex-adjusted association between OCS use and ACE2 mRNA expression (β 0.48 ± 0.16, p <
0.01) did not persist after additional adjustment for COPD (β 0.30 ± 0.17, p = 0.07).

TMPRSS2 mRNA expression is increased upon cigarette smoke exposure in in vitro
cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs).
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR in HBECs,
cultured at air liquid interface (ALI) and exposed to air or cigarette smoke (CS). ACE2 mRNA
expression was not altered 3, 6 and 24 hours after CS-exposure (Figure 6A). In contrast, after
6 and 24 hours the TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in CS-exposed HBECs was significantly
increased, compared to air exposed cells (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION
As healthcare systems around the world are currently under great pressure due to the COVID19 outbreak, identification of those at high risk is crucial. There is compelling evidence of a
more severe course of COVID-19 in smokers and patients with comorbidities such as COPD.
We clearly demonstrate an increased pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor
ACE2 in smokers and COPD subjects at both mRNA and protein level, by RT-PCR and
immunohistochemistry respectively. Our study in smokers with and without COPD confirms
our hypothesis that their increased risk for severe COVID-19 may be at least partially attributed
to increased ACE2 expression. Importantly, we demonstrate higher ACE2 protein levels not
only in bronchial epithelium but also in alveolar epithelium of patients with COPD, which can
be directly linked to the site of injury when patients with severe COVID-19 develop dyspnea,
hypoxia and pneumonia.
COPD is a highly prevalent disease affecting over 250 million people worldwide. Currently,
published data on COVID-19 in patients with COPD are fairly limited [22]. Nevertheless, an
increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 as well as a higher mortality, has been reported
in patients with COPD and in current smokers [8, 12, 13, 23]. Although there are several
possible explanations for the increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 in patients with
COPD, including older age, comorbidities, dysregulated immune defenses and impaired
mucociliary clearance, increased pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor
ACE2 is most likely an important contributor [24, 25]. Importantly, it has been demonstrated
in mouse models that transgenic (over)expression of human ACE2 enhances the pathogenicity
of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [26, 27]. Moreover, human ACE2 was essential for viral
replication in the lung. The same is true for the presence of host cell proteases such as
TMPRSS2 and furin, that are essential in the viral entry process [28].

We measured mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in lung tissue samples from 120
never smokers and smokers with and without airflow limitation and demonstrate higher ACE2
mRNA levels in current smokers and patients with moderate (GOLD II) and severe to very
severe COPD (GOLD III-IV). Importantly, ACE2 mRNA expression shows an inverse
correlation with physiological parameters of airway obstruction and emphysema. Linear
regression analysis confirms that smoking and COPD are associated with increased ACE2
mRNA expression, independent of covariables such as age, gender, comorbidities, and
medication use. The association between COPD and ACE2 mRNA seems to be partly driven
by smoking as the effect size of the association between COPD and ACE2 mRNA decreased
after adjusting for smoking. The remaining statistically significant association between COPD
and ACE2 mRNA might be explained by other factors such as aggravated pulmonary and
systemic inflammation, previous exacerbations or genetic predisposition. Interestingly, a recent
large meta-analysis of transcriptomic data confirms the increased ACE2 mRNA expression in
lung tissue of smokers and patients with COPD [28].
TMPRSS2 mRNA expression is only significantly higher in patients with (very) severe COPD.
However, there is a significant correlation between TMPRSS mRNA and ACE2 mRNA
expression levels, even in sensitivity analyses omitting (very) severe COPD patients from the
analysis. Our data suggest that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed on the same cells, and
co-expression might further increase the chance of viral entry.
By immunohistochemical (IHC) staining we reveal expression of ACE2 in both bronchial and
alveolar epithelial cells, with the latter predominantly in alveolar type II (ATII) pneumocytes.
Already in 2004 Hamming et al. described expression of ACE2 in ATII cells and this has
recently been confirmed by both IHC and single cell RNA sequencing analyses [29-31]. Similar
analyses also confirm the expression of ACE2 in bronchial epithelial cells, including goblet
cells [31, 32].

By quantification of the ACE2 IHC staining, we demonstrate increased protein levels of ACE2
in both alveolar and bronchial epithelium of current smokers and patients with moderate and
(very) severe COPD. Linear regression analyses suggest that these associations are partly driven
by smoking. Importantly, we are the first to report quantitative evidence for increased ACE2
protein levels in alveolar epithelium, which is the primary site for pathogenic pulmonary
infections and could thus explain why smokers and patients with COPD are more prone to
develop bilateral pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe
COVID-19. Indeed, the preferential expression of ACE2 on alveolar type II epithelial cells
might make these cells more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus-induced cell death.
Since ATII cells produce surfactants which are crucial for preventing alveolar collapse during
breathing, SARS-CoV-2 induced targeting and lysis of ATII cells will alter lung compliance
and induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in severe COVID-19, leading to hypoxia and
respiratory failure [33]. Our findings of increased ACE2 levels in bronchial epithelial cells
complement the recent paper of Leung et al., who reported increased ACE2 mRNA expression
in bronchial brushings of smokers and patients with COPD [32].
In vitro cultures of primary HBECs at air liquid interface reveal increased mRNA expression
of TMPRSS2 6 and 24 hours after a single exposure to cigarette smoke, indicative of an acute
effect of smoking on the TMPRSS2 levels in the bronchial epithelium. ACE2 expression might
be more dependent on chronic cigarette smoke exposure, since no effect on ACE2 mRNA
expression is observed in these short-term in vitro experiments.
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential in the treatment of asthma and a subgroup of COPD
patients (i.e. with a history of frequent exacerbations). Since ICS are often regarded as
immunosuppressive, there is a general concern on whether or not to continue the use of ICS
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our current data shows no association between
the ICS use and the expression of ACE2 in the lung. We do report significantly increased ACE2

expression in subjects using oral corticosteroids (OCS), albeit based on a low number of
subjects using OCS, implicating the need to confirm these preliminary findings in larger studies.
By performing linear regression analyses on our data set, we reveal that lifestyle factors and
comorbidities that are linked to a more severe course of COVID-19, such as smoking, COPD,
and especially diabetes are associated with a higher expression of ACE2 protein in alveolar
tissue. However, due to the observational design of this cross-sectional study, we cannot defer
any causal relationships from these associations. Moreover, our results need to be replicated in
larger studies and in subjects of other ethnicities.
The main strength of this study is the large number of lung tissue samples from well-phenotyped
subjects that are included in the both RT-PCR and IHC analyses. Moreover, IHC allowed us to
quantify ACE2 protein levels in both bronchial and alveolar epithelium. However, certain
limitations should be kept in mind. First, this study consists mainly of lung tissue from
lobectomy. Since these patients might not be representative for the general population, we
cannot exclude selection bias. Second, differential information bias may have occurred when
questioning smoke status at the time of lobectomy, since COPD status was known to the
investigator. However, by carefully checking medical records, we ascertained accurateness of
the patient characteristics. Last, although this study consisted of a relatively large and wellphenotyped cohort, samples size may be insufficient for multivariate linear regression analyses.
In conclusion, we report higher ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissue of smokers and
subjects with moderate to (very) severe COPD. Importantly, ACE2 protein levels are not only
increased in bronchial but also in alveolar epithelium. In addition, TMPRSS2 mRNA
expression is higher in lung tissue of (very) severe COPD subjects and increases in in vitro
cultured HBECs upon acute exposure to cigarette smoke. These results indicate an easier host
cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 in both smokers and patients with COPD and are crucial in
identifying populations at risk for severe COVID-19.
