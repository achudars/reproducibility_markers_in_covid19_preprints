Abstract

2

Background: In autumn 2020, many countries, including the Netherlands, are experiencing a second wave

3

of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health policymakers are struggling with choosing the right mix of measures to

4

keep the COVID-19 case numbers under control, but still allow a minimum of social and economic activity.

5

The priority to keep schools open is high, but the role of school-based contacts in the epidemiology of SARS-

6

CoV-2 is incompletely understood. We used a transmission model to estimate the impact of school contacts

7

on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess the effects of school-based measures, including school closure, on

8

controlling the pandemic at different time points during the pandemic.

9

Methods and Findings: The age-structured model was fitted to age-specific seroprevalence and hospital

10

admission data from the Netherlands during spring 2020. Compared to adults older than 60 years, the estimated

11

susceptibility was 23% (95%CrI 20—28%) for children aged 0 to 20 years and 61% (95%CrI 50%—72%) for the

12

age group of 20 to 60 years. The time points considered in the analyses were (i) August 2020 when the effective

13

reproduction number (Re ) was estimated to be 1.31 (95%CrI 1.15—2.07), schools just opened after the summer

14

holidays and measures were reinforced with the aim to reduce Re to a value below 1, and (ii) November 2020

15

when measures had reduced Re to 1.00 (95%CrI 0.94—1.33). In this period schools remained open. Our model

16

predicts that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays, in the absence of other measures, would have

17

reduced Re by 10% (from 1.31 to 1.18 (95%CrI 1.04—1.83)) and thus would not have prevented the second wave

18

in autumn 2020. Reducing non-school-based contacts in August 2020 to the level observed during the first wave

19

of the pandemic would have reduced Re to 0.83 (95%CrI 0.75—1.10). Yet, this reduction was not achieved and

20

the observed Re in November was 1.00. Our model predicts that closing schools in November 2020 could reduce

21

Re from the observed value of 1.00 to 0.84 (95%CrI 0.81—0.90), with unchanged non-school based contacts.

22

Reductions in Re due to closing schools in November 2020 were 8% for 10 to 20 years old children, 5% for 5 to

23

10 years old children and negligible for 0 to 5 years old children.

24

Conclusions: The impact of measures reducing school-based contacts, including school closure, depends on the

25

remaining opportunities to reduce non-school-based contacts. If opportunities to reduce Re with non-school-

26

based measures are exhausted or undesired and Re is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based

27

measures may be considerable, particularly among the older school children.

Introduction

29

In autumn 2020, many countries, including the Netherlands, are experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19

30

pandemic [1]. During the first wave in spring 2020, general population-based control physical distancing measures

31

were introduced in the Netherlands, which included refraining from hand-shaking, work from home if possible, self-

32

isolation of persons with cold- or flu-like symptoms and closure of all schools. These contact-reduction measures

33

were relaxed starting from May, and the incidence of COVID-19 started to increase again at the end of July [1].

34

From the end of August onward, contact-reduction measures were reintroduced in a step-wise manner. Schools

35

closed during July and August for summer break, reopened at the end of August, and have remained open until

36

this day (December 7, 2020), with the exception of a one-week autumn break. Some measures were implemented

37

in schools after the summer break to reduce transmission. Students and teachers in secondary schools have to wear

38

masks when not seated at their desks, and students have to keep distance from teachers. A student with cold- or

39

flu-like symptoms has to stay at home.

40

The step-wise increase in control measures after the summer started with earlier closing times of bars and restaurants,

41

reinforcement of working at home (in September), followed by closure of all bars and restaurants, theaters, cinemas

42

and other cultural meeting places in November and obligatory mask wearing in all public places since December 1.

43

Estimated effective reproduction numbers (Re ) were about 1.3 at the end of August and about 1.0 since November

44

13th [1]. The aim of the implemented measures was to reduce Re to 0.8. The failure to achieve this might be due to

45

reduced societal acceptance of control measures, and/or due to the lack of schools closure. The role of children and

46

their contacts during school hours in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is in fact not well understood [2]. In this study,

47

we explored this role with a mathematical model fitted to COVID-19 data from the Netherlands.

48

Closure of schools is considered an effective strategy to contain an influenza pandemic [3], based on both model

49

calculations and observational studies of the influence of school holidays on the spread of influenza [4, 5]. The

50

reasons for this are the high contact rates in young age groups [6] and the susceptibility of children and young

51

people to the influenza virus. In contrast to influenza, children seem to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than

52

adults and, based on sparse data, the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 increases with age [7, 8].

53

In the absence of empirical SARS-CoV-2 data, mathematical modeling can help to quantify the role of different

54

age groups in the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the population [9], and to evaluate the impact of interventions

55

on transmission [10–13]. Such models can estimate the reduction in the effective reproduction number for different

56

contact-reduction scenarios within or outside school environments. Model predictions about the relative epidemic

57

impacts of school- and non-school-based measures can assist policymakers to select sets of measures during different

58

stages of the pandemic that optimally balance potential harms and benefits. Predictions generated by models that

59

include differences in susceptibility and contract rates in different age groups can also aid in deciding which school

60

age groups should be the primary target of school-based interventions.

61

We used an age-structured transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 fitted to the number of hospital admissions due

62

to COVID-19 and seroprevalence during spring 2020 in the Netherlands to evaluate the impact of reducing school

63

and other (non-school-related) contacts in society to control the second wave of COVID-19 in the autumn of 2020.

64

We provide a comparative impact of these measures on the effective reproduction number in August 2020, before

65

the most recent set of measures was implemented, and in November 2020, when the most recent measures were

66

still in place. We assess which combinations of school and non-school related measures are most likely successful

67

in reducing the reproduction number to below 1 and which school ages should be targeted to design effective

68

school-based interventions.

Methods

Overview

71

Estimates of epidemiological parameters were obtained by fitting a transmission model to age-stratified COVID-19

72

hospital admission data (n = 10, 961) and cross-sectional age-stratified SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data (n =

73

3, 207) [14]. The model equipped with parameter estimates was subsequently used to investigate the impact of

74

school- and non-school-based measures on controlling the pandemic.

75

Data

76

The hospital data included n = 10, 961 COVID-19 hospitalizations by date of admission and stratified by age during

77

the period of 69 days following the first official case in the Netherlands (27 February 2020).

78

The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data was taken from a cross-sectional population-based serological study carried

79

out in April-May 2020 [14]. A total of 40 municipalities were randomly selected from the Netherlands, with

80

probabilities proportional to their population size. From these municipalities, an age-stratified sample was drawn

81

from the population register, and 6, 102 persons were invited to participate. Serum samples and questionnaires were

82

obtained from 3, 207 participants and included in the analyses. The majority of blood samples were drawn in the

83

first week of April.

84

Our analyses made use of the demographic composition of the Dutch population in July 2020 from Statistics

85

Netherlands [15] and age-stratified contact data for the Netherlands [16,17]. The contact rates before the pandemic

86

were based on a cross-sectional survey carried out in 2016/2017, where participants reported the number and age of

87

their contacts during the previous day [16]. The contact rates after the first lockdown were based on the same survey

88

which was repeated in a sub-sample of the participants in April 2020 (PIENTER Corona study) [16]. School-specific

89

contact rates for the Dutch population before the pandemic were taken from the POLYMOD study [6, 17].

90

Transmission model

91

We used a deterministic compartmental model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a population stratified by

92

infection status and age (Figure 1 A). The dynamics of the model follows the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-

93

Recovered structure. Persons in age group k, where k = 1, ..., n, are classified as susceptible (Sk ), infected but not

94

yet infectious (exposed, Ek ), infectious in m stages (Ik,p , where p = 1, . . . , m), hospitalized (Hk ) and recovered

95

without hospitalization (Rk ). Susceptible persons (Sk ) can acquire infection via contact with infectious persons

96

(Ik,p ) and become latently infected (Ek ) at a rate βk λk , where λk is the force of infection, and βk is the reduction

97

in susceptibility to infection of persons in age group k compared to persons in age group n. After the latent period

98

(duration 1/α days), exposed persons become infectious (Ik,1 ). Infectious persons progress through (m − 1) stages

99

of infection (Ik,p , where p = 2, . . . , m) at rate γm, after which they recover (Rk ). Inclusion of m identical infectious

100

stages allows for the tuning of the distribution of the infectious period, interpolating between an exponentially

102

distributed infectious period (m = 1) and a fixed infectious period (m → ∞). Intermediate values of m correspond
√
to an Erlang-distributed infectious period with mean 1/γ and standard deviation 1/[γ m]. Hospitalization (Hk )

103

of infectious persons (Ik,p ) occurs at rate νk . Since the model is fit to hospital admissions data, the disease-related

104

mortality and discharge from the hospital are not explicitly modeled. Given the timescale of the pandemic and the

105

lack of reliable data on reinfections, we assume that recovered individuals cannot be reinfected. As the timescale of

106

the pandemic is short compared to the average lifespan of persons, we neglected natural birth and death processes,

107

and the population size in the model stays constant.

108

We assume that, before the first lockdown, the probability of transmission per contact between a susceptible and an

109

infectious individual, , is independent of the age of two individuals. After introduction of the control measures in

110

March 2020, this probability of transmission decreased to ζ1 , where 0 ≤ ζ1 ≤ 1. (1 − ζ1 ) then denotes the reduction

111

in the probability of transmission due to general population-based measures that are not explicitly included in the

112

model, such as refraining from shaking hands, physical distancing, mask-wearing, and self-isolation of symptomatic

113

persons. We denote the general contact rate of a person in age group k with persons in age group l, ckl , and the

114

contact rates specific to the periods before and after the first lockdown, bkl , and, akl , respectively (see Figures 1 B

115

and C). We model the transition in the general contact rate using a linear combination

101

ckl = [1 − f (t)]bkl + ζ1 f (t)akl ,

116

117

(1)

where the contribution of the contact rate after the first lockdown is given by the logistic function

f (t) =

118

1
1 + e−K1 (t−t1 )

(2)

119

with the mid-point value t1 and the logistic growth K1 . The parameter K1 governs the speed at which control

120

measures are rolled out, and t1 is the mid-time point of the lockdown period (Figure S1). The special cases of

121

f = 0 and f = 1 describe the contact rate before and after the first lockdown, with f values between 0 and 1

122

corresponding to contact rates at the intermediate time points.

123

Similarly, the contact rate incorporating the relaxation of control measures after the first lockdown is modeled as

124

follows

125

ckl = ζ1 g(t)akl + [1 − g(t)]ζ2 (bkl − skl ) + ωskl ,

126



where g(t) = 1/ 1 + eK2 (t−t2 ) with the mid-point value t2 > t1 and the logistic growth K2 . In Eq. 3, the first two

127

terms describe the increase of non-school contacts from the level after the first lockdown to their pre-lockdown level.

128

The parameter ζ2 ≥ ζ1 , 0 ≤ ζ2 ≤ 1 implies that the probability of transmission increased due to reduced adherence

129

to control measures. The last term describes opening of schools which we assume to happen instantaneously, where

case. We assumed that there were no hospitalizations during this 5 day period. As initial condition for the model,

148

Given predictions of the model, we calculated the likelihood of the data as follows. In the model, infectious
Pm
individuals are hospitalized at a continuous rate νk p=1 Ik,p . However, the hospitalization data consists of a

155

discrete number of hospital admissions hk,i on day Ti for each age class k. As the probability of hospitalization

156

is relatively small, we made the simplifying assumption that the daily incidence of hospitalizations is proportional

157

to the prevalence of infectious individuals at that time point. To accommodate errors in reporting and within age

158

class variability of the hospitalization rate, we allowed for over-dispersion in the number of hospitalizations using a

159

Negative-Binomial distribution, i.e.,

160

 P

m
hk,i ∼ NegBinom νk p=1 Ik,p (Ti ), r ,

161

where we parameterize the NegBinom(µ, r) distribution with the mean µ and over-dispersion parameter r, such

162

that the variance is equal to µ + µ2 /r.

163

We calculated the likelihood of the seroprevalence data using the model prediction of the fraction of non-susceptible

164

individuals in each age class 1 − Sk (T )/Nk . Here T denotes the median sampling time minus the expected duration

165

from infection to seroconversion. We assumed that the probability of finding a seropositive individual in a random

166

sample from the population is equal to the fraction of non-susceptible individuals, leading to a Binomial distribution

167

for the number of positive samples `k among all samples Lk from age group k

specific contact rates with ten age groups, defined by the following age intervals [0,5), [5,10), [10,20), [20,30),

171

[30,40), [40,50), [50,60), [60,70), [70,80) years old and the group of all persons older than 80 years referred to as

172

80+ age group. Due to the low number of hospitalizations in young persons, we assumed that hospitalization

173

rates in the first three age groups (i.e., [0,20) years old) were equal. The relative susceptibility was estimated for

174

persons in [0,20), [20,60) and 60+ age categories, where 60+ age category was used as the reference [7]. As the age

175

groups for which the seroprevalence was reported [14] are different from the age groups used in our model, we used

176

demographic data from the Netherlands [15] and the smoothed age-specific seroprevalence curve estimated by Vos et

177

al. [14] to correct for this discrepancy. The Bayesian prior distributions for the estimated parameters (see Table 1)

178

are listed in Table 2. In the main text, we presented results for three infectious classes (m = 3) corresponding to

179

Erlang-distributed infectious periods. The model was fitted to the data using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method

180

as implemented in Stan (https://www.mc-stan.org) [21]. We used 4 parallel chains of length 1500 with a warm-up

181

phase of length 1000, resulting in 2000 parameter samples from the posterior distribution. The data and the Stan

and R scripts with all parameter settings are available at https://github.com/lynxgav/COVID19-schools.

Model outcomes

184

We considered control measures aimed at reducing contact rate at schools or in all other locations. Main outcome

185

measures were age-specific seroprevalence and hospital admissions. In addition, we evaluated the impact of a control

186

measure by computing the effective reproduction number (Re ) using the next generation matrix method [18, 22],

187

and percentage of contacts that need to be reduced to achieve control of the pandemic as quantified by Re = 1.

Epidemic dynamics

190

The model shows a very good agreement between the estimated age-specific hospitalizations and the data (Figure

191

2). The number of hospitalizations increases with age, with the highest peaks in hospitalizations observed in persons

192

above 60 years old. The estimated probability of hospitalization increases nearly exponentially with age (as shown

193

by an approximately linear relationship on the logarithmic scale, Figure 3), except for persons under 30 years old,

194

in whom the number of hospitalizations was low. The estimated probability of hospitalization increased from 0.09%

195

(95%CrI 0.05—0.15%) in persons under 20 years old to 4.37% (95%CrI 2.80—8.82%) in persons older than 80 years

196

(Figure S2).

The dark gray lines correspond to 95% credible intervals obtained from 2000 parameter samples from the
posterior distribution, and the shaded region shows 95% Bayesian prediction intervals. The dots are daily
hospitalization admission data.

197

The model accurately reproduces the percentage of seropositive persons distributed across the age groups (Figure

198

4). The median seroprevalence in the population was 2.7%, with the maximum seroprevalence observed in persons

199

between 20 and 40 years old (about 3.5%). The lowest seroprevalence was among children in the 0 to 10 years

200

age group (0.9%). Note that if our model did not include age-dependence of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, the

201

seroprevalence peak would be expected among children because they have the largest numbers of contacts in the

202

population.

203

The estimated probability of transmission per contact was 0.07 (95%CrI 0.05—0.12) before the first lockdown and

204

it decreased by 48.84% (95%CrI 23.81—87.44%) after the first lockdown. The reduction in susceptibility relative

205

to susceptibility in persons above 60 years old was 23% (95%CrI 20—28%) in persons under 20 years old and 61%

School and non-school based measures

211

The sequence of measures implemented and lifted during the pandemic in the Netherlands and the respective

212

estimated values of the effective reproduction numbers are shown schematically in Figure 5. We used the fitted

213

model to separately determine the effect on the effective reproduction number of decreasing contacts in schools and

214

of decreasing other (non-school-related) contacts in society in August 2020 (Figure 6) and November 2020 (Figure

215

7). In doing so, we varied one type of contact and kept the other type constant. For each scenario, the reduction

216

in contact rate was varied between 0% and 100%. The aim of reducing the number of contacts of each type is to

217

decrease the effective reproduction number below 1.

218

We first considered the situation in August 2020 (Figure 6), when schools had just opened after the summer holidays

219

and when general control measures in the population were less stringent than in April (full lockdown). Between

August and December 2020, the only infection prevention measure in primary schools was the advice to teachers and

221

pupils to stay at home in case of symptoms or a household member diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection; physical

222

distancing between teachers and pupils (but not between pupils) only applied to secondary schools. We therefore

223

assumed that the effective number of contacts in schools was the same as before the pandemic (ω = 1). For the

224

non-school related contacts we assumed that 1) the number of contacts increased after April 2020 (full lockdown)

225

but was lower than before the pandemic, and that 2) the transmission probability per contact was lower due to

226

general physical distancing and hygiene measures. The starting point of our analyses is an effective reproduction

227

number of 1.31 (95%CrI 1.15—2.07) in accordance with the situation in August 2020 (Figure S4 C). Specifically, to

228

achieve Re = 1.31 we fixed ζ2 at 0.67 (decrease in adherence to contact-reduction measures in August as compared

229

to April, when ζ1 is estimated at 0.51) and g at 0.5 (half-way in the relaxation of non-school contacts).

230

Assuming the state of the Dutch pandemic in August 2020, Figure 6 A demonstrates that non-school related contacts

231

would have to be reduced by at least 50% to bring the effective reproduction number to 1 (if school related contacts

232

do not change). A 100% reduction would resemble the number of contacts in April (full lockdown) and would bring

233

the effective reproduction number to 0.83 (95%CrI 0.75—1.10). Figure 6 B demonstrates that reductions of school

234

contacts would have a limited impact on the effective reproduction number (if non-school contacts do not change).

235

A 100% reduction (complete closure of schools) would have reduced the effective reproduction number by only 10%

236

(from 1.31 to 1.18 (95%CrI 1.04—1.83)).

237

Subsequently, we considered the Dutch pandemic situation in November 2020 (Figure 7), when the measures im-

238

plemented since the end of August (partial lockdown intended to prevent the second wave) had led to an effective

239

reproduction number of 1.00 (95%CrI 0.94—1.33) (Figure S4 D), and, as described above, only limited control

240

measures were taken in schools. Now, the impact of interventions targeted at reducing school contacts (Figure

241

7 B) would reduce the effective reproduction number similarly as reducing non-school contacts in the rest of the

242

population (Figure 7 A). Specifically, closing schools would reduce the effective reproduction number by 16% (from

243

1.0 to 0.84 (95%CrI 0.81—0.90)) (Figure 7 B). Almost the same Re , i.e., 0.83 (95%CrI 0.75—1.10), would have been

244

achieved by reducing non-school related contacts to the level of April 2020 while the schools remain open (Figure

245

7 A).

schools. The solid black line describes the median, the shaded region represents the 95% credible intervals

(situation November 2020), the green line is the value of Re achieved for 100% reduction in contacts. To control

246

Interventions for different school ages

247

Next we investigated the impact of targeting interventions at different age groups, starting from the situation in

248

November 2020 with the effective reproduction number being 1 (Figure S4 D). Figure 8 A, B, and C show Re as

249

a function of the reduction of school contacts in age groups of [0,5), [5,10) and [10,20) y.o., respectively. In each

250

panel, we varied the number of school contacts in one age group while keeping the number of school contacts in the

251

other two age groups constant. 0% reduction corresponds to the situation in November 2020, and 100% reduction

252

represents a scenario with schools for students in a given age group closed. The model predicts a maximum impact

253

on Re from reducing contacts of 10 to 20 year old children (Figure 8 C). Closing schools for this age group only

254

could decrease Re by about 8% (compare Figure 8 C and Figure 7 B where we expect the reduction of 16% after

255

closing schools for all ages). Schools closure for children aged 5 to 10 years would reduce Re by about 5% (Figure 8

256

B). Contact reductions among 0 to 5 year old children would have negligible impact on Re as shown in Figure 8 A.

describes the situation in November 2020 with Re of about 1 (partial lockdown intended to prevent the second

Discussion

258

We used an age-structured model for SARS-CoV-2 fitted to hospital admission and seroprevalence data during spring

259

2020 to estimate the impact of school contacts on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess the effects of school-

260

based measures, including schools closure, to mitigate the second wave in the autumn of 2020. We demonstrate how

261

the relative impact of school-based measures aimed at reduction of contacts at schools on the effective reproduction

262

number increases when the effects of non-school-based measures appear to be insufficient. These findings underscore

263

the dilemma for policymakers of choosing between stronger enforcement of population-wide measures to reduce non-

264

school-based contacts or measures that reduce school-based contacts, including complete closure of schools. For the

265

latter choice, our model predicts highest impact from measures implemented for the oldest school ages. We used the

266

Netherlands as a case example but our model code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries

267

given the availability of hospitalization and seroprevalence data. The findings in our manuscript can be relevant for

268

guiding policy decisions in the Netherlands, but also in countries where the contact structure in the population is

269

similar to that of the Netherlands [6].

270

Our model integrates prior knowledge of epidemiological parameters and the quantitative assessment of the model

271

uncertainties in a Bayesian framework. The model has been carefully validated to achieve an excellent fit to data

272

of daily hospitalizations due to COVID-19 and seroprevalence by age. Furthermore, reproduction numbers at

273

different time points of the pandemic correlated well with estimates obtained from independent sources [1]. Finally,

274

susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to increase with age, which corroborates published

275

findings [7,8]. Compared to adults older than 60 years, the estimated susceptibility was about 20% for children aged

276

0 to 20 years and about 60% for the age group of 20 to 60 years. However, even with extensive validation, we need to

277

be careful when interpreting the predictions of our model as these depend on the sensitivity of serology to identify

278

individuals with prior infection. Recent studies suggest that in persons who experience mild or asymptomatic

279

infections, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may not always be detectable post-infection [23, 24].

280

Naturally, our findings result from age-related differences in disease susceptibility and contact structure. Despite

281

high numbers of contacts for children of all ages, and in particular in the age group of 10 to 20 years old, closing

282

schools appeared to have much less impact on the effective reproduction number than physical distancing measures

283

outside the school environment. In fact, measures effectively reducing non-school contacts, similar to those measures

284

implemented in response to the first pandemic wave in spring 2020, could have prevented a second wave in autumn

285

without school closures. With an estimated effective reproduction number of 1.3 in August 2020, continuation of

286

school closures would have had much lower effects than measures aiming to reduce non-school related contacts,

287

which mainly occur in the adult population. Yet, that situation changes if the proposed measures fail. In November

288

2020, the measures implemented since August had reduced the effective reproduction number to around 1, instead

289

of achieving the target value of about 0.8. In that situation, as our findings demonstrate, additional physical

290

distancing measures in schools could assist in reducing the effective reproduction number further, in particular

291

when implemented in secondary schools. Our analyses suggest that physical distancing measures in the youngest

292

children will have no impact on the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of note, better adherence to non-school based

293

measures would still have similar effects as reducing school-based contacts.

294

Although there are several options for reducing the number of contacts between children at school, such as staggered

295

start and end times and breaks, different forms of physical distancing for pupils and division of classes, the effects

296

of such measures on transmission among children have not been quantified. Importantly, we have assumed that

297

reductions in school-based contacts are not replaced by non-school-based contacts with similar transmission risk.

298

Our modelling approach has several limitations. For estimating disease susceptibility we could only model children

299

as group of 0 to 20 years old. As disease susceptibility increases with age, it seems obvious that effects of reduced

300

school contacts are most prominent in older children. Assuming equal susceptibility across these ages may have

301

underestimated to some extent the effect of reducing school contacts for children between 10 and 20 years. At the

302

same time, we assumed that school contact patterns in August-November 2020 reflect the pre-pandemic situation.

303

Yet, universal control measures in the Netherlands such as stay at home orders for symptomatic persons probably

304

lower infectious contacts in school settings too, meaning that some reduction compared to pre-pandemic levels of

305

contacts could already be present in schools. Effects of these measures in school settings should be smaller than in

306

the general population and are hard to estimate due to a large number of asymptomatic cases among children, and

307

therefore were not taken into account. In this respect, the results reported here describe the maximum possible

308

reduction in the effective reproduction number due to school interventions. Furthermore, the contact matrices

309

available did not allow differentiation between various types of contacts outside schools (like work, leisure, transport

310

etc.), as these were not available for periods during the pandemic. Therefore, we could not model the impact of

311

reducing work-related or leisure-related contacts separately. We also could not include hospitalization data from

312

the second wave of the pandemic due to lack of data availability.

313

The potential effects of opening or closing schools in different phases of the pandemic have been reported in other

314

studies [11, 25–30]. Also based on a mathematical model, Panovska-Griffiths et al. [25] predicted that without

315

very high levels of testing and contact tracing reopening schools after summer with a simultaneous relaxation of

316

measures will lead to a second wave in the United Kingdom, peaking in December 2020. Their model predicted

317

that this peak could be postponed for two months (to February 2021) by a rotating timetable in schools. Very early

318

in the pandemic, in March 2020, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies in the United Kingdom, concluded

319

that it would not be possible to get the effective reproduction number below 1 without closing schools [26]. In a

320

modelling study on the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, Davies

321

et al. found that the impact of school closures was low [11]. In another modeling study Rice et al. [30] found that

322

school closures during the first wave of the pandemic could increase overall mortality, due to death being postponed

323

to a second wave. And based on an analysis of the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures in 41 countries between

324

January and May 2020, Brauner et al. [27] concluded that closure of schools and universities had contributed the

325

most to lowering the effective reproduction number. Yet, a major difficulty in estimating the effect of school closure

326

based on observational data from the first wave is that other non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented

327

at or around the same time as school closures [31]. Similarly, lifting such measures often coincided with school

328

re-openings. Observational data from the period after the first wave show conflicting results on within school

329

transmission [32–35] and the effect of school reopening and interpretation is further hampered by the variety in

330

control measures implemented in schools across countries. Finally, Munday et al. showed that reopening secondary

331

schools is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England [28].

332

While the modelling approach of [28] is different from ours, our findings are similar in the sense that secondary

333

schools are predicted to make a larger contribution to transmission than primary schools, and are therefore more

334

important for controlling COVID-19.

335

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the potential effects of school-based measures to reduce contacts between

336

children, including school closures, markedly depends on the reduction in the effective reproduction number achieved

337

by other measures. With remaining opportunities to reduce the effective reproduction number with non-school-

338

based measures, the additional benefit of school-based measures is low. Yet, if opportunities to reduce the effective

339

reproduction number with non-school-based measures are considered to be exhausted or undesired for economic

340

reasons and Re is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable. In such

341

situations, the biggest impact on transmission is achieved by reducing contacts in secondary schools.

Figure S1. Contribution of the contact rate after the first lockdown. We model the transition in the
general contact rate, ckl , as follows ckl = [1 − f (t)]bkl + ζ1 f (t)akl , where f is the contribution of the contact rate
after the first lockdown, bkl and akl are the contact rates specific to the periods before and after the first
lockdown. f is a logistic function with parameters K1 and t1 governing the speed and mid-way of lockdown
roll-out. The red and gray lines show the median and several individual estimated trajectories, respectively.
