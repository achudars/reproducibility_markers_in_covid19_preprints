As of March 23, 2020 there have been over 354,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
over 180 countries, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the United States
(US) announced a national state of emergency.1, 2, 3 In parts of China and Italy the demand for intensive care (IC)
beds was higher than the number of available beds.4, 5 The limited availability of testing results in the US make it
challenging to estimate the demand for hospital beds that will be generated by COVID-19 patients. We sought to
build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant
uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading
in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect
their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses.
We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds,
Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID19 and how these compare to the available resources. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6
Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. The
patient population inputs are the starting population of COVID-19- patients, COVID-19+ patients, and the estimated
doubling time for total COVID-19 admissions (i.e. how many days it will take for the number of total admissions at
the institution to double). For the patient cohorts, we estimated what percentage of the COVID-19+ patient
population would follow 5 potential trajectories through the hospital, assuming various combinations of patient flow
between IC and AC. Until more reliable data are available, estimates for input values are generated through review
of existing data and discussion with experts.7, 8 The model will be updated as data become available.
The model produces a daily time series. The first day of the simulation (Day 0) is fixed. For each subsequent day the
model uses the projected number of COVID-19 patients, partitions the patients into cohorts, and updates the number
of COVID-19 patients requiring IC and AC beds as follows:

COVID-19 Admissions: We project the total COVID-19 admissions with an exponential growth model
using data based on the first 14 days of patient admissions (The number of total admitted patients up to day
n is the product of the number of patients admitted up to day 0 and 2 to the power of n divided by the
doubling time).
Patient Cohorting: The patients are partitioned into 5 care cohorts: Cohorts 1 and 5 are patients who spend
time only on, respectively, a General Medicine AC floor and an IC unit. The remaining 3 cohorts are
patients who spend time in an IC unit, only before, only after, or both before and after spending time on an
AC unit (Table 1).
Cohort Length of Stay: Each patient in each cohort spends the number of days specified by the parameter
inputs in the IC and AC units. The total census in each of the IC and AC units for each day is calculated as
the sum of the patients that arrived in that unit minus the sum of the patients that have been discharged
from that unit.
Projected IC Bed Requirements: The number of IC beds required each day is the sum of the number of
COVID-19+ and COVID-19- IC patients.
Projected COVID-19 Medical Team Requirements: The number of patients to be cared for by the Medical
Service each day is the sum of the number of COVID-19+ AC patients and COVID-19- patients being
cared for by the Medicine Service.
Projected AC Bed Requirements: The number of AC beds required each day is the sum of the number of
COVID-19+ and COVID-19- AC patients.
Ventilator Requirements: The number of ventilators required is estimated as the sum of 50% of nonCOVID-19 IC patients and 100% of COVID-19+ IC patients.

The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified
as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses.
We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical
acute care medical center with 100 IC beds, 220 AC beds, 75 ventilators, 80% occupancy of both IC and AC beds, 1
COVID-19+ IC patient, 2 COVID-19+ AC patients, and a total patient doubling time of 6 days. For COVID-19+
patients, 70% were assumed to stay only in AC for an average LOS of 5 days and 30% were assumed to spend at
least one day in IC with an average IC LOS of 8 days and average AC LOS of 9 days (Table 1).
Model projections
The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23
(Figure 1a), the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27
(Figure 1a), and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the
capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21 (Figure 1b).
Sensitivity analyses
When the doubling time of new admissions is decreased to 3 days (50%), the number of days until IC and AC hit
capacity decrease are, respectively, 11 and 9. When the doubling time is increased to 12 days (200%), the number of
days until IC and AC hit capacity are, respectively, 51 and 51.
Discussion:
In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for
patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model,
the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for
hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and
AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.
An insight revealed by the model is that under some plausible scenarios, AC may reach capacity before IC and
become a bottleneck preventing discharges from IC. In addition to increasing capacity, managers must develop
strategies to reduce AC occupancy such as accelerating efforts to discharge patients to convalescent or step-down
care such as a hotel or nursing care facility.
The main limitation of this model is the fact that most of the inputs are based on estimates. The epidemiology of
COVID-19 is critically important, and ongoing research will update the model. The model is very sensitive to
specific aspects of the epidemiology, especially doubling time. The model environment can be easily updated with
new parameter data to generate a more precise projection.
