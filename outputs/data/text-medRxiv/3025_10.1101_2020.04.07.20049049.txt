Abstract
Epidemiologists use mathematical models to predict epidemic trends, and these results are inherently
uncertain when parameters are unknown or changing. In other contexts, such as climate, modellers use
multi-model ensembles to inform their decision-making: when forecasts align, modellers can be more
certain. This paper looks at a sub-set of alternative epidemiological models that focus on the growth rate,
and it cautions against relying on the method proposed in (Pike & Saini, 2020): relying on the data for
China to calculate future trajectories is likely to be subject to overfitting, a common problem in financial
and economic modelling. This paper finds, surprisingly, that the data for China are double-exponential,
not exponential; and that different countries are showing a range of different trajectories. The paper
proposes using non-parametric and local regression methods to support epidemiologists and
policymakers in assessing the relative effectiveness of social distancing policies. All works contained

Background
Mathematical models are routinely used in ‘prediction of epidemic trends’ (Pellis et al., 2020). The
inherent uncertainty in these models, and in the early stages of an epidemic, is evident from the calls from
epidemiologists at Oxford, UK, for ‘large scale serological surveys’ (Lourenço et al., 2020) to improve the
accuracy of parameters such as susceptibility; and in the range of scenarios presented by epidemiologists
at Imperial, UK (Ferguson et al., 2020). This difficult in choosing and parameterising the most effective
prediction model is not unique to epidemiology. To resolve this, climate modellers use multi-model
ensembles in their decision-making processes, acknowledging that ‘even if the perfect climate model did
exist, any projection is always conditional on the scenario considered’ (Tebaldi & Knutti, 2007). Similarly,
after the 2008 global financial crisis, over-reliance on equilibrium models by policymakers was recognised
as both ‘ubiquitous’ (Bezemer, 2010) and ‘flawed’ (Bieta et al., 2012); leading to widespread calls for
alternative approaches.

Motivation
All models need to meet some basic criteria: they need to be theoretically grounded, and they need to be
replicable across different settings, preferably with out-of-sample back-testing. This paper is motivated
by a plethora of articles that focus on the ‘doubling rate’, which is the time taken for the total number of
people infected to double. The ‘doubling rate’ is related to the growth rate (see Table 2) and successful
reduction in the growth rate, by both individual and public health measures, is the goal of social distancing
and other interventions. The aim is to flatten the curve and avoid a huge peak that would overwhelm
health services (Wighton, 2020). The recent spate of articles includes contributions from nonepidemiologists and the media (Cuffe & Jeavans, 2020; Financial Times, 2020; Pike & Saini, 2020). The
author is not arguing for alternative approaches to be given equal weight in the decision-making process,
but to inform the debate by helping explain differences in outcomes between countries. In addition, this
research is motivated by a desire to test the validity of assumptions made by Pike and Saini (2020), who
used data from China to predict out of sample death rates in other countries after the implementation of
social distancing.

Ethics
There is a well-established principle in econometrics that using a limited dataset to forecast is generally
frowned upon as overfitting (Bailey et al., 2016; Chalana, 2017). For that reason alone, the author would
caution against relying too heavily on the data from China. Following a well-established precautionary
principle that, in medical research, ‘one should take reasonable measures to avoid threats that are serious
and plausible’ (Resnik, 2004), the author has refrained from using recent data on death statistics published
by individual countries, and has instead focused on infection statistics (CSSE, 2020; UK-Government,
2020). Forecasting health care needs is known to be uncertain (Grenfell et al., 1994; Rein et al., 2011) but
infection rates have the advantage that they are a leading indicator for pressure on intensive care beds.
The author is required to get approval from his University ethics committee for research that ‘would
induce psychological stress, anxiety or humiliation’ (DMU, 2020) and, given the author is not an
epidemiologist, full approval and peer review were sought before pre-publication. Underestimates of

intensive care beds could lead to a reduction in compliance with social distancing which, in turn, could
lead increased harm to those most at risk of infection. Conversely, overestimates of intensive care beds
could lead to unnecessary public health measures which, in turn, could lead to additional financial and
economic harm.

Research question and data
Is the impact of social distancing on coronavirus growth rates comparable across different settings?
Following the precautionary principle above, the null hypothesis proposed is that social distancing in
different contexts is likely to lead to different outcomes. This is to avoid a Type 1 error – the rejection of
a true null hypothesis – the equivalent of convicting an innocent person in a criminal trial. Historical data
of cases in China are used. The start date for country comparisons is when cases reach fifty or more;
information on relative lockdown dates is also shown in Appendix 1. The data were taken from the
Humanitarian Data Exchange (Humanitarian Data Exchange, 2020) and, prior to 22nd January 2020 for
China, from China’s National Health Commission (National Health Commission, 2020). The R scripts used
to run the tests are shown in Appendix 2. All works contained herein are provided free to use worldwide

Method
The first step in time series analysis is to collect and cleanse the data. This process requires transparency
regarding how the data have been collected and handled, with any discrepancies resolved before analysis
(DHSC, 2020). In finance and economics, the method most used is to winsorize to a stated range or
percentage (Kroszner et al., 2007). Given the growth rate in infections for China fell below 0.005% after
45 days, data after this date are excluded. The author also excluded data from February 12th, when it was
reported that infections in China jumped due to a change in the measurement method (Feuer, 2020)
Model fitting using the full data is shown in Appendix 4 as a robustness check.
An assumption that growth is exponential, in the early stages of an epidemic, is supported by the literature
(Chowell et al., 2015; Nishiura et al., 2010), although the author is aware that other approximations exist,
including polynomial. This paper does not attempt to review the theory behind this. For exponential-type
growth, there are three choice of mathematical models: exponential-unrestrained; log-log (as per
exponential, but with a longer period of decline); and logistic (approximately exponential at first, but with
a reduced rate as an upper limit is approached). A logistic model fails the precautionary principle in that
the carrying capacity, or c, can only be estimated ex-post. Hence, a logistic model is discarded.
The models being tested are therefore:
Model 1 –ln(active cases) v time: 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑒 𝑘𝑡 or 𝑙𝑛(𝑦) = 𝑎′ + 𝑘𝑡
Model 2 - ln(active cases) v ln(time): ln⁡(𝑦) = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑙𝑛(𝑡)

Where y = active 1cases; t = time; and a, 𝑎′ and b are constants
In financial time series analysis, for a stochastic (i.e.: random walk) process such as stock price movements,
𝑝𝑡
the rate of change in prices is generally used
: this technique is also applied here as
∆𝑦 = 𝑙𝑛(𝑦𝑡 ) −⁡ 𝑙𝑛(𝑦𝑡−1 ) ⁡ ≡

⁡( 𝑡

𝑝𝑡−1

− 1), as a way to model when there are no new cases and the rate of

𝑦

change falls to zero (ln ( ) = ln(1) = 0). Hence, two further models are tested, namely:
𝑦

Model 3 – daily rate of change: (

𝑦𝑡
)
𝑦𝑡−1

= 𝑎𝑒 𝑘𝑡 or ∆𝑦 = 𝑎′ + 𝑘𝑡

Model 4 - daily rate of change vs ln(time): ∆𝑦 = 𝑎′ + 𝑏𝑙𝑛(𝑡)

Next, 𝑙𝑛⁡(∆𝑦), a double-exponential model, is tested2. In this model, as the rate of change approaches
zero (𝑦𝑡 → 𝑦𝑡−1 )⁡then (ln(∆𝑦) → ⁡ −∞).⁡For example, when the daily change in new cases falls to 1%,
ln⁡(∆𝑦) is -4.6. Finally, the rate of change in the rate of change is included, or ∆∆𝑦 = 𝑙𝑛(∆𝑦𝑡 ) −
𝑦
𝑦
⁡ 𝑙𝑛(∆𝑦𝑡−1 ) ⁡ ≡ ( 𝑡 − 1)/( 𝑡−1 − 1). If there is an increase in the daily growth rate, this number is
𝑦𝑡−1

𝑦𝑡−2

positive; if there is a decrease in the daily rate, this number is negative. It is not quite a stochastic process,
because there should be a decrease in the daily growth rate over time, as the number of recovered cases
increases:
Model 5 – double-exponential: 𝑙𝑛(∆𝑦) = 𝑎′ + 𝑘𝑡
Model 6 – rate of rate of change: ∆𝑦𝑦 = 𝑎′ + 𝑘𝑡

The next step in time series forecasting, after data cleansing, is to analyse the goodness-of-fit to
alternative models. This is done graphically, by plotting time (x axis) against each model – the closer the
result is to a straight line, the better the goodness-of-fit.

Figure 1 plots the results for winsorized data from China. These confirm that Model 3 and Model 5 are an
approximate linear fit, and Model 6 shows convergence towards zero. The author understands that
log(time) relationships are found in nature (Dahly, 2017) as are hyper and double-exponential
(Varfolomeyev & Gurevich, 2001). However, for the next part of the paper, the focus of the analyses is on
relative growth rates, as shown in Model 5, and on falls/increases in the rate of change, as shown in Model
6.

For this paper, good data for recovered cases are not available. The author considered using new cases in the last
10 days as a proxy for active cases, but the analysis would be incomplete. Instead, total cases have been used. This
is likely to bias results after 30 days or so, when recovered cases are likely to outweigh active cases.

The author understands this to be a Laplace distribution.

Therefore, not only should the reader be wary of overfitting using the China data to extrapolate; the
reader should also be wary of overfitting via OLS (linear) regression.

The next part of this analysis applies a non-parametric method to determine how the growth rate varies
vary over time. Data for China were split into four groups: 1-10 days; 11-20 days; 21-30 days, and 31-40
days. From a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test (results
not shown) the growth rates in each period are significantly different. To illustrate this, Appendix 6 shows
locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) for the first three groups - 1-10 days; 11-20 days; and 2130 days – using Model 5. For comparison, the author understands that the paper by (Pike & Saini, 2020)
uses Model 3.

Appendix 6 show a marked drop in the growth rate over 30 days, with most of the drop occurring in the
second period – 11-20 days. These results provide researchers with some visible patterns that might, or
might not, emerge from the data for other countries as social distancing continues. Hence, the last part
of this analysis uses Model 5 to compare all countries. From Table 2, when the number of new cases
approaches zero, the model approaches −∞; alternatively, when the number of new cases falls to 1%,
the model is approximately -4.6, which is a doubling rate of every 70 days or so. Hence, the lower the yaxis the better.

The following figures are organized as follows. Figure 2 show growth rates for the fifty countries with the
highest total cases (in descending order). The x-axis starts from the day that cases reach fifty in that
country; China is the only country to have dipped below a 1% daily growth rate; although Austria, South
Korea and Norway have had a similar trajectory so far.

Figure 3 focusses on the highest median daily growth rates in the first period - 1-10 days - after a country
or region has reached fifty cases. The countries with the highest initial growth rates are Iran, Turkey, Italy,
South Korea and Spain; Cameroon is also included in this group because it has the highest median growth
rate in the second period - 11-20 days.

Figure 4 focusses on those countries and regions where growth rates are lowest in the third period – 2130 days. With the caveats, above, about data and methodological issues, these are countries that have
managed to bring the pandemic under control within 30 days. Eleven regions of China, that would
dominate this table, have been excluded so that other low growth rate countries are revealed: South
Korea, Lebanon, Australia NSW, Bahrain, and British Columbia. Lastly, Figure 5 shows those countries
where growth rates have fallen most compared to earlier period; this includes countries that had high
initial growth rates but are succeeding in bringing down the growth rate quickly – the mean rate of rate
of change is most negative in these countries - France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, UK and Norway.

Conclusion
The methodology presented here is a non-parametric and graphical approach, using freely available
software, to test whether different phases of social distancing are comparable across different settings. If
the null hypothesis, that social distancing is not comparable, can be rejected, then policymakers can be
reassured that their social distancing measures are being successful. All works contained herein are
provided free to use worldwide by the author under CC BY 2.0

With the above caveats above data quality, transparency, and consistency, the data for China show that
strong social distancing led initially to a high reduction in the growth rate; then a rapid decline towards a
daily growth rate of <1% by 30 days; followed by a stable period of low transmission. There is some
evidence, from the data shown in Figures 2-5, that European countries in the panel are showing similar
trajectories since social distancing. However, China dominates the results for Figure 4 – lowest median
growth rates after 21-30 days – and only a handful of countries are showing similar reductions.

Whilst there are lower initial growth rates in several countries, such as Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar and
Singapore – the evidence presented thus far supports the null hypothesis that social distancing in different
contexts is likely to lead to different outcomes. To the author’s knowledge, there is no theoretical basis
for assuming that other countries will follow China’s trajectory. Rather, the evidence, from the results
presented, is that a range of different outcomes are likely. Policymakers will need to take account of
differences in social, cultural, political, and economic factors; to take account of different data collection,
quality, and consistency issues across different settings; and should take account of the lag, of around 10
days, between the start of social distancing and any significant impact on the number of cases. In other
words, policy needs to be based on what is happening in hospitals and communities.

These are tentative conclusions, and the results require replication and confirmation – this is a pre-print
of the paper. With these caveats; this approach could inform the policy debate around the effectiveness
of different approaches of social distancing. There are three parts to the methodology: i) determining if
data from different countries shows a similar exponential distribution using Models 5 and Model 6 ii) using
graphical and LOESS approaches to determine whether the data from different contexts are following the
same trajectories in equivalent periods 1-10, 11-20 and 21-30 days, and iii) using non-parametric
approaches to see if growth rates are significantly lower from one period to the next.

In terms of prediction, the author supports those epidemiologists who are calling for better data
(Lourenço et al., 2020) through testing, and who are presenting a range of scenarios (Ferguson et al.,
2020); until such time that a consensus emerges from a multi-modelling perspective. In particular, the
author cautions against giving much weight to models that extrapolate from growth rates, or that assume
other countries will necessarily follow the same path as China, in order to avoid a type 1 error and
rejection of a true null hypothesis. To paraphrase the infinite monkey theorem, that is not to say that,
with enough predictive models, at least one of them will fit the available data by chance. Following the

precautionary principle, the author recommends against policy recommendations that are not supported
by clinical observations in the field and/or by a convergence of predictions from different epidemiological
prediction models, such as the SIR models at Oxford, UK and Imperial, UK.

Lastly, as well as using this method to compare different phases of social distancing across countries, the
methodology might also be useful for regional analyses; and for sociologists, economists and political
scientists to determine the social, economic, and political factors that underpin successful social
distancing.
