Abstract. The pandemic originated by coronavirus(covid19), name coined
by World Health Organization during the first month in 2020. Actually,
almost all the countries presented covid19 positive cases and governments are choosing different health policies to stop the infection and
many research groups are working on patients data to understand the
virus, at the same time scientists are looking for a vacuum to enhance
imnulogy system to tack covid19 virus. One of top countries with more
infections is Brazil, until August 11 had a total of 3,112,393 cases. Research Foundation of Sao Paulo State(Fapesp) released a dataset, it was
an innovative in collaboration with hospitals(Einstein, Sirio-Libanes),
laboratory(Fleury) and Sao Paulo University to foster reseach on this
trend topic. The present paper presents an exploratory analysis of the
datasets, using a Data Mining Approach, and some inconsistencies are
found, i.e. NaN values, null references values for analytes, outliers on results of analytes, encoding issues. The results were cleaned datasets for
future studies, but at least a 20% of data were discarded because of non
numerical, null values and numbers out of reference range.

Introduction

The outbreak of Coronavirus(Covid19) started with first cases on December
2019, in Wuhan(China). The first reported case[1] in South America was in Brazil
on 26 February 2020, in São Paulo city. The strategy to stop the infections in
the country was a partial lockdown to avoid the propagation of the virus.
On 28 January 2020, Ministry of Health of Brazil reported a suspected case
of Covid19 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, recently one student returned
from China [2], [3]. The same day were reported two suspected cases in Porto
Alegre and Curitiba [4]. The first confirmed COVID-19 case [5] were reported
in Brazil, a man of 61-year-old who returned from Italy. The patient was tested
in Israelita Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo state. On 14 May[6], more than 200
000 cases were confirmmed, this number double during the first days of May.

Until August 11, the numbers of Brazil1 are: total of 3,112,393 cases, with an
increasing rate of new cases of 44,255(+1.4%) and a total of 2,243,124 recovered
cases.
Nowdays, many scientists are working around coronavirus covid19, but searching for conducted studies in South America, there is only a few number. After
a searching in IEEX Xplorer using coronavirus, covid19 terms, one paper with
Brazilian Affiliation is found [7], related to data augmentation for covid19 detection. Considering a preprint repository related to Medicine(Medxriv), using
terms: covid19, coronavirus, data mining more than 50 papers are found.
The table 1 presents the top 10 results of MedxRiv query. Four of this papers
is a conducted study for South America countries and there is any work analyzing
Brazilian context. In spite of, there is 4 papers with Brazilian Affiliation.

2.1

Exploring data

This step involves: check format files, open the files using a Language Programming or a tool. Review number of registers or rows per each file. Check existence
of null values, check kind of each variable or field. For this step, Python Language
Programming and pandas package are used to manipulate the data.
2.2

Pre-processing Data

This step is related how to deal with data before of generate graphics for analysis.
– If a specific variable must be numerical, but there is string values, so it is
discarded
– If null values are found, a discarding process must be considered.
– If range reference for one exam, analytes is null then the analysis is not
possible.
2.3

Analysis

Using clean data is possible to answer some questions related to age distribution, sex distribution, distribution of results to detect anomalies or outliers. The
questions can require a kind of specific graphic to suppot analysis.
2.4

Visualization

Considering distribution of few classes, a pie chart is useful to check proportions, subsection 3.3, 3.8 . For age distribution, bar plot can show how is the
distribution, see subsection 3.4, 3.5, 3.6. The analysis is dozen of values can be
supported for boxplot graphics, in subsection 3.9, 3.10.

Exploration

This subsection present some graphics to describe data and let posterior analysis,
besides the requeriment of some graphics related to distribution, i.e. bar plot,
boxplot.
Description of datasets The Figure 2 is presented with counting values,
unique values, top for each field. The name of columns were transformed to
lowercase to have an uniform name of fields.

Fig. 2. (a) Einstein, (b) Fleury and (c) SL Datasets Description

– Figure 3.b presents a different number of id paciente in patient dataset and
exam dataset, 129596(patient) 129595(exam).
– Einstein and SL Hospitals( cd pais ) presents people living in countries different than Brazil.
– The most frequent age of patients is: 38(Einstein, Fleury) and 34(SL).
– Female patients are higher in number in Einstein, Fleury.
– Most frequent cd uf, cd municipio is Sao Paulo State or city and CCCC is
most common in Postal Code, so this places do not have meaningful number
of ocurrences.
– Einstein and Fleury have a unique de origem: Hosp, Lab respectively. But
SL Hospital has 56 different.
– The exam hemograma(blood count) is the most frequent in the datasets, and
de analito more frequent in Eistein, Fleury are related to Covid19.
– Eistein has the lowest number of different de exame(61), de analito(127).
Fleury has the highest de exame(722), de analito(978). SL has de exame(478),
de analito(652). Therefore, numer of de valor referencia are related.
– SL Hospital presentes NaN(Not a number) values, then it is possible find
NaN values in the datasets.
3.3

Sex Distribution

Female population is slightly bigger than male population in Einstein, Fleury
but SL presents male population bigger for 0.05%(29 people), see Fig. 3.

Most frequent exams per month

To answer what were the most frequent exams during the month of each dataset,
graphic Fig. 7 presents the 20 most frequents.
– Three datasets has blood count exam on the top of each month.
– Only Fleury has exams related to covid19 detection on April, May, June on
the top 5.

– There are many kind of exams related to covid19 for Hospital, i.e. PCR,
Sorologia SARS-Cov-2/Covid19 (Einstein). Fleury has NOVO Coronavirus
2019, Covid19 Anticorpos lgG, lgM, lgA and more. SL Hospital has Covid19 PCR para Sars-Cov2 and a problem with encoding is detected in this
dataset.
– For the previous reason, each dataset is studied separately.

Most frequent analyte per month

Einstein and Fleury presents analytes related to covid19, i.e. resultado covid19,
Covid19 deteccao por PCR, Covid19 material and more. Again, Fleury presents
a variety of names for analytes related to covid19. And SL Hospital does not
have any in the top 20.

Covid19 Analytes Distribution

Considering analytes related to covid19, graphic 8 presents the number of detected/not detected during the months for Hospital Einstein. Fleury and SL do
not have an standardized outputs of covid19 exams, therefore is not possible to
generate the graphics yet.

Fig. 8. Analyte per month(Einstein)

3.9

Boxplot of most frequent exams

Considering top 14 of de analito and de resultado, the graphic Fig. 9 is presenting boxplot of the values of Einstein Hospital. It is necessary not to consider
qualitative values, then only numerical values were used to build the plot. Analyzing the graphic is remarkable to many outliers in many of analytes, then a
cleaning process is necessary.

Fig. 9. Boxplot of top 14 analytes (Einstein)

Splitting data of covid19 detected and no detected, figure Fig. 10 is presented.
Again, outliers are present in Fleury dataset. Red ones(detected), blue(not detected).

Fig. 10. Boxplot of top 14 analytes(Fleury)

Using a cleaning process using standard deviation(std) is proposed, because
the outliers are further than median and in normal case two or three times
higher is considered an abnormal value but in this situation, to have a better
visualization of boxplot was used 0.5*std(see Fig. 11) and 0.2*std(see Fig. 11)
on Einstein dataset considering analytes with abnormal values.

Fig. 12. Men Analytes

The next graphic 13 present the distribution for positive cases of covid19.
In the two previous images 12 and 13 is possible to observe a concentration
of outliers in the sides of the normal distribution, i.e. TGO, TGP, Creatinina,
Neutrófilos #, Ureia.

Fig. 13. Men Analytes - Positives covid19 cases

And graphic 14 introduces the result after of cleaning values and considering
patients with positive cases and the date when it was detected until it finishes
or open(no date for discard test). Because the aim of the analysis is understand
how is the behaviour of the patients with positive diagnosis of covid19 during
the active phase of virus, from the start until the end. Analyzing, Fig. 14, it is
possible to notice that the presence of outliers has disappeared, an exception
with Basófilos #.

values out of reference range are not considered. For checking if values are inside
of reference range, it was manually because there was many reference values too,
only the lowest and highest value were used to filter data. Then, the reduction
can be from 0.83 to 75.30 %. An initial number of exams was 108,152 and final
value after filtering 86,814 with a reduction of almost 20% of the available data.
Now, dataset is ready to answer more question and the research can continue.

Conclusions

Coronavirus pandemic is active in the world, scientist are working to understand
how to stop the virus, many areas are studying the covid19 impact in Heath,
Economy therefore datasets related to patients are useful and important. Fapesp
initiative to gather university and hospital is remarkable because it can foster
research on the topic.
Real world datasets are not clean or ready for Data Mining or Data Science
tasks then an exploratory phase is mandatory to see if data can be representative
or useful to answer questions. Then, many cleaning steps were necessary to
generate the final dataset and graphic, besides this cleaning step reduced the
available dataset of men in 20%, with a maximum value of 75.30% for Magnesium
Analyte, then it is possible a meanignful reduction of data is a cleaning task is
performed.
Finally, share the process of analysis is useful for researchers interested to
analyze with this dataset, so it can save time, effort to future research.

Analysis of Covid19 Brazilian Dataset

Recommendations

For researchers interested to work with these datasets, consider:
– Check if range of dates for each dataset to know if this data is useful for
your study.
– Sirio-Libanes Hospital has some issues related to encoding, this is the smallest dataset then you must analyze if it useful for analysis and search for the
problems to fix them.
– Only Einsteing dataset has a standardized output for covid19 exams: detected or not detected. If you are from Computer Science or related field,
this is better for your study. Because, Fleury has a variety of outputs, therefore is necessary the presence or advice of one person related to Medicine to
explain you the different values.
– If you want to automatize filtering considering reference range of values,
remember there are many for many analytes, then the suggestion is check
this manually to check if it is possible to code the process.

6

Future Work

For further work, a crossing of data is proposed to improve the analysis considering other variables, i.e. social-economic data, previous existence of health issues
related to patients, considering data of other hospital to enhance the study. By
the other hand, a deep analysis will be performed with this new cleaned dataset.
