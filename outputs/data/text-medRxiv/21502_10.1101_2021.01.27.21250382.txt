Abstract

35

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, serology, Spike trimer ELISA

36
37

Background: Spike protein domains are being used in various serology-based assays to detect

38

prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there has been limited comparison of human

39

antibody titers against various spike protein antigens among COVID-19 infected patients.

40

Methods: We compared four spike proteins (RBD, S1, S2 and a stabilized spike trimer (ST))

41

representing commonly used antigens for their reactivity to human IgG antibodies using indirect

42

ELISA in serum from COVID-19 patients and pre-2020 samples. ST ELISA was also compared

43

against the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA test. Further, we estimated time appropriate IgG and IgA

44

seropositivity rates in COVID-19 patients using a panel of sera samples collected longitudinally

45

from the day ofonset of symptoms (DOS).

46

Results: Among the four spike antigens tested, the ST demonstrated the highest sensitivity

47

(86.2%; 95% CI: 77.8-91.7%), while all four antigens showed high specificity to COVID-19 sera

48

(94.7-96.8%). 13.8% (13/94) of the samples did not show seroconversion in any of the four

49

antigen-based assays. In a double-blinded head-to-head comparison, ST based IgG ELISA

50

displayed a better sensitivity (87.5%, 95%CI: 76.4-93.8%) than the EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA

51

(67.9%, 95% CI: 54.8-78.6%). Further, in ST-based assays, we found 48% and 50%

52

seroconversion in the first six days (from DOS) for IgG and IgA antibodies, respectively, which

53

increased to 84% (IgG) and 85% (IgA) for samples collected ≥22 days DOS.

54

Conclusions: Comparison of spike antigens demonstrates that spike trimer protein is a superior

55

option as an ELISA antigen for COVID-19 serology.

Introduction

58

COVID-19 pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-

59

CoV-2) has already crossed 97 million detected cases and over 2 million deaths worldwide till

60

date [1]. As the pandemic continues, we need accurate and sensitive tests to assess the

61

prevalence, disease burden and the level of population immunity against the virus. With the

62

introduction of multiple vaccines and several ongoing vaccine trials, identifying prior exposure or

63

immunogenicity of the vaccine in individuals becomes critical to the development of vaccination

64

and public health strategies.

65

Nucleic acid-based tests that detect viral RNA are widely used to diagnose active infection in

66

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals [2,3]. In contrast, immunological tests like serological assays

67

detect the level of human antibody response to the infection in symptomatic as well as the large

68

fraction of asymptomatic infections [4–7]. Immuno-assays detect antigen-specific IgA, IgM and

69

IgG immunoglobulins (antibodies) from body fluids like serum or plasma. Viral antigen-specific

70

antibodies can be detected in SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals within 5-12 days post-onset of

71

symptoms (POS) for IgM and IgA antibodies and 14 days for IgG antibodies [8,9]. IgG antibodies

72

are long-lived, detectable for at least 8 months, making them promising recent and long term

73

markers of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [10].

74

Serological assays with nucleocapsid or spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as capturing antigen have

75

been widely developed and reported, as these antigens are highly immunogenic [11,12].

76

Nucleocapsid protein bound to the viral RNA is significantly conserved among the coronaviruses,

77

contributing to false positives in immunoassays [13,14]. The spike (S) protein decorates the

78

exterior of SARS-CoV-2 virus and helps in host cell entry [15–17]. Anti-spike antibodies also

79

demonstrate high virus neutralization efficacy [18,19]. The spike glycoprotein is a clove-shaped

80

trimeric protein with each unit consisting of the S1 head and the S2 stalk. The Receptor Binding

81

Domain (RBD) of the S1 head is responsible for binding to the ACE2 receptor on the cellular

82

membrane, initiating cell entry [16,20]. Due to the large size (153 KDa) of S protein and challenges

83

with achieving proper protein folding, it is difficult to express in bacteria and provides poor yields

84

using traditional mammalian expression systems. Capture antigens used for serological assays

85

should be easy to express and purify, with high yield and stability. Recently, the prefusion state

86

of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (ST) protein was stabilized by the addition of 6 prolines that improved

87

thermal stability and expression yield in mammalian cell suspension culture, making it a promising

88

antigen for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays [21].

89

In this study, we evaluated the ST protein as a potential capture antigen for ELISA and compared

90

it with different subunits of S protein, namely, S1, S2 and RBD to assess IgG antibody titers in

91

SARS-CoV-2 positive and pre-pandemic sera. We also used ST protein to elucidate IgG and IgA

92

antibody response dynamics with time-stratified samples (≤6, 7-14, 15-21 and ≥22 days POS).

93

Further, we benchmarked the ST protein ELISA against an FDA approved (EUROIMMUN)

94

serology ELISA kit.

Sample collection

98

For COVID-19 samples, 1-2 ml of blood was drawn from patients who had tested positive for

99

SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test. One set of serum samples (n=69) of COVID-19 patients were

100

obtained from individuals hospitalized at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute

101

(BMCRI) between April-May 2020. All these samples were collected ≥15 days post-onset of

102

symptoms or RT-PCR positivity (POS/RT). A separate set of serum samples (n=100; collected

103

between March-August 2020) were obtained from COVID-19 biorepository of Translational Health

104

Science and Technology Institute, Delhi (THSTI) that were time stratified along the course of

105

COVID-19 infection (25 samples each from day 0-6, 7-14, 15-21 and ≥22 days POS). For COVID-

118

transfected into Expi293F cells grown using Expi293 expression medium. The cells were grown

119

in a cell culture incubator (37°C, ≥80% relative humidity and 8% CO2) on an orbital shaker (130

120

rpm). Transfection was done at a final cell density of 3×106 viable cells/ml using ExpiFectamine

121

293 transfection kit as per kit’s instructions. Culture media were harvested after 5 days post-

122

transfection. ST protein was purified using Gravity Flow Strep-Tactin XT resin, whereas RBD

123

protein was purified by HisTrap FF Crude histidine-tagged column on AKTA-Start FPLC system

124

and concentrated using Centricon filter spin columns. Average purified protein yields of 12 mg/l

125

and 61 mg/l were achieved for ST and RBD protein respectively. Spike protein subunits S1 (Native

incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 h with gentle shaking, followed by washing. Serum

136

samples (50 μl) diluted 1:100 times in PBS with 1 mg/ml BSA were added to the wells. After 30

137

min of incubation at RT, plates were washed 5 times with 300 μl of wash buffer. 50 μl of

138

horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-Human IgG (GeNei, HPO2) or IgA specific (Sigma-

139

Aldrich, A0295) antibody diluted 1:3000 in PBS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20 was added

140

to the wells and incubated at RT for 30 min. Excess antibody-enzyme conjugate was removed by

141

washing the wells 5 times with 300 μl wash buffer. 50 μl of chromogenic tetramethylbenzidine

142

(TMB) substrate was added, and plates were incubated in the dark with constant shaking. The

143

reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 50 μl of stop solution (8.5 M acetic acid and 0.5 M

144

sulfuric acid). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific

145

Varioskan Flash). Background signal for each sample was estimated by running the same assay

146

without any antigen coating. Corrected OD value was obtained by subtracting the background

147

signal for each sample from its respective OD value in the presence of the antigen. The cut-off

148

value was calculated based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the control samples’ OD

149

values as mean + 3SD.

150

Antigen concentration for ELISA was determined by titrating the antigens at different

151

concentrations till signal saturation. The ST reactivity to SARS specific antibodies was tested with

152

an ELISA titration of the SARS Spike specific antibody CR3022 (Native Antigen MAB12422,

153

Supplementary Figure 1). Diluted serum was titrated, and IgG ELISA was performed using ST

154

with COVID-19 positive and control samples to determine the optimal sera dilution

155

(Supplementary Figure 2). We selected 1:100 sera dilution for performing all the ELISAs based

156

on the high correlation between area under the sera dilution curves and the signal contrast

157

between COVID-19 and control samples (Supplementary Figure 2c-d).

Results

169

Comparison between different spike antigens for human IgG antibodies

170

We compared four different spike protein antigens (S1, S2, RBD and ST) that represent different

171

protein segments commonly being used to evaluate serum reactivity among SARS-CoV-2

172

patients (Figure 1a). 94 COVID-19 samples collected ≥15 days DOS/RT, and 94 control samples

173

were tested for the presence of spike-specific IgG antibodies (Figure 1b). We noted that in-house

174

purified RBD and ST performed better than commercially procured S1 and S2 in terms of

175

sensitivity and intensity of the positive sample signal. ST showed the highest sensitivity (86.2%)

176

followed by RBD (69.9%), while S1 and S2 domains showed very low sensitivity (51.5% and

177

50.0%, respectively) (Table 1). 13 COVID-19 samples were found below the cut-off values for all

178

four antigens.

179

Among control samples, 64.9% (61/94) were positive for Dengue IgG ELISA, 96.8% (91/94) for

180

Influenza A and 97.8% (92/94) for Influenza B IgG antibodies. This confirmed that these control

181

samples had other detectable virus specific antibodies. Despite this, we obtained specificity

182

>94.7% for all the four antigens (Table 1), suggesting low cross-reactivity of spike antigens s to

183

antibodies for these viruses.

184

S1, RBD and ST antigens displayed a high correlation among themselves (Pearson’s correlation

185

coefficient (PCC) >0.75 for all cases). S2 subunit displayed a lower correlation (PCC 0.66-0.68)

186

to others. This is likely because the structurally buried S2 domain in the spike protein is less

187

accessible to the antibodies. Nevertheless, the significant correlation across all four antigens

188

(Figure 1c, PCC >0.65), suggests that antibody responses across all spike antigens are consistent

189

and that they are all detectable in our ELISA platform.

ST detected higher OD values, possibly because of the larger number of epitopes available on

201

the full-length soluble trimeric protein. It also displayed the highest contrast between COVID-19

202

positive and control groups (Figure 1b). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicates that

203

ST is the best candidate for serological testing with the highest area under the curve (Figure 1d).

204

Further, when the ST-based ELISA was repeated in 93 samples (56 COVID-19 positive samples

205

and 37 control samples) in a blind manner, we obtained highly reproducible values (PCC=0.986,

and 81.1% for >11 days post PCR positivity [22]) and lesser than those obtained by others (84.4%

Dynamics of IgG and IgA response in SARS-CoV-2 infections

223

We performed ELISA assays for spike specific IgG and IgA antibodies in sera collected at different

224

time points (≤6, 7-14, 15-21 and ≥22 days POS) using ST protein. Median OD values of IgG and

225

IgA response increased with time (Figure 3a-b; IgG: 0.21, 0.69, 1.40, 1.57, IgA: 0.26, 0.49, 0.77,

226

1.06 for the respective time intervals). Also, the proportion of patients who demonstrated

227

seroconversion increased with time (Figure 3c; IgG: 48.0%, 64.0%, 84.0%, 84.0%, IgA: 50.0,

228

69.6, 72.7, 85.0% for the respective time intervals). In both cases, about 50% of the patients had

229

seroconverted within 6 days from DOS. These findings are in line with previous reports that have

230

shown median time for seroconversion based on spike specific IgG antibodies to be 14 days POS

Some individuals did not show detectable spike-specific antibodies (16% for IgG, 15% for IgA)

241

even after 21 days from DOS. This could be due to asymptomatic/mild infection which has been

242

reported to display low antibody titers [6]. We cannot rule-out false-positive PCR results

contributing to some of these cases.

Discussion

247

The trimeric spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 is critical for cellular entry and is prominently

248

displayed on the virus. Our results revealed that ST protein displayed better reactivity to COVID-

249

19 positive sera when compared to S1, S2 and RBD spike subunit proteins consistent with the

250

larger number of accessible antibody epitopes on ST. While we did not perform neutralization

251

assays, previous studies have shown that the antibodies against RBD are strongly correlated with

252

neutralization of the virus [18,19,29]. Several other regions of the Spike protein, including a region

253

away from receptor binding site [30], S1 domain [31] and S2 domain [32–34] are targets of

254

neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, a high ELISA signal against the ST protein is suggestive of

255

higher levels of a broader spectrum of virus-neutralizing antibodies.

256

IgG and IgA antibody dynamics show seroconversion in about half of the patients within 6 days

257

POS (also reported earlier, [9,27,35]). Considering the low sensitivity of many existing rapid

258

antigen tests [36–38], a combination of the rapid antigen detection with antibody tests can be

259

employed to increase the detection efficiency of COVID-19 cases during early infection.

260

Some COVID-19 RT-PCR positive samples did not show reactivity against any of the four

261

antigens. Several other studies have reported limited seroconversion at the time of sera collection

262

[6,39,40]. Nevertheless, highly sensitive serology assays can be critical in determining the sero-

263

prevalence in a community as well as help in assessing the immune response/ immunogenicity

264

of vaccines including the temporal course of antibody responses. Our results show that the human

265

antibody response is consistent among the spike antigens, and the spike trimer maybe the best

266

choice of antigen for COVID-19 serology.
