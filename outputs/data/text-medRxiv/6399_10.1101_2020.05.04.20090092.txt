Abstract
Variation in free-living, microparasite survival can have a meaningful impact on the
ecological dynamics of established and emerging infectious diseases. Nevertheless,
resolving the importance of environmental transmission in the ecology of epidemics
remains a persistent challenge, requires accurate measuring the free-living survival of
pathogens across reservoirs of various kinds, and quantifying the extent to which
interaction between hosts and reservoirs generates new infections. These questions are
especially salient for emerging pathogens, where sparse and noisy data can obfuscate
the relative contribution of different infection routes. In this study, we develop a
mechanistic, mathematical model that permits both direct (host-to-host) and indirect
(environmental) transmission and then fit this model to empirical data from 17 countries
affected by an emerging virus (SARS-CoV-2). From an ecological perspective, our
model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. Summarizing, we propose that
fitting such models with environmental transmission to real outbreak data from SARSCoV-2 transmission highlights that variation in environmental transmission is an
underappreciated aspect of the ecology of infectious disease, and an incomplete
understanding of its role has consequences for public health interventions.

Introduction
The ecology of infectious disease has provided a theoretical basis for understanding
how interactions between microbes, their hosts, and environments, shape the severity
of epidemics. Mathematical modeling methods offer means of testing a systems
perspective such that we can explore—if even theoretically—the consequences of
underappreciated routes of transmission in epidemics. This is useful in the case of
emerging diseases, where it may be challenging to fully resolve all of the features of an
epidemic, including the influence of different routes of transmission on key features of
an epidemic. That is, even though there is a large literature on environmental
transmission (or “fomite” transmission), relatively few studies have explored how
particulars aspects of environmental transmission—the nature, composition, and
frequency of environmental reservoirs—can influence disease dynamics.

Lack of clarity regarding of the signature of variation in environmental transmission is
especially notable in emerging diseases, where data sets are elusive, sparse, or noisy.
For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused one of the most
devastating pandemics of the last century. The complex set of epidemiological
characteristics defining COVID-19 outbreaks presents a number of challenges for
controlling this disease. As a consequence, countries have achieved varying levels of
success in reducing transmission and protecting vulnerable populations, often with
dramatic variation from setting to setting in the epidemic growth rate, intensity, and/or
severity. The basic reproductive number (ℛ0) (1-3), fatality rate (4-5), incubation period
(4, 6-8), transmission interval (9), prevalence of super-spreading events (10-11) and

other relevant aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology provide a mechanistic window into
how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in different settings. However, one feature of SARSCoV-2 transmission that was validated in laboratory settings, but whose epidemiological
role remains highly controversial, is SARS-CoV-2 free-living survival (12-14).
Specifically, while several laboratory and epidemiological findings have suggested that
environmental transmission may play a role in some settings (11, 13-16), none have
fully investigated how this route of transmission may influence features of outbreaks,
and have cast doubt about its relevance as a significant mode of transmission at all
(17). These unknowns notwithstanding, the availability of SARS-CoV-2 data make it a
valuable model for examining the particulars of environmental transmission in emerging
outbreaks.

In this study, we use confirmed case data and laboratory and epidemiologically
validated parameters to develop a mechanistic transmission model. Using this, we
evaluate the potential for variability in environmentally-mediated transmission to explain
variability in various features associated with the intensity of outbreaks. This framework
includes parameters corresponding to the transmission of the virus from both
presymptomatic/asymptomatic and clinical (symptomatic) carriers of virus, and the
possibility that susceptible hosts can acquire infection through environmental reservoirs.
We examine how outbreak dynamics can be influenced by differences in viral free-living
survival that include empirical values for survival on various abiotic reservoirs (e.g.
aerosols, plastic, copper, steel, cardboard) (12).

Specifically, our findings highlight the need for an empirically-informed, mechanistic
understanding of the ecology of emerging viral outbreaks—including the particulars of
how free-living virus survives on different abiotic surfaces, and in aerosol form—should
be a greater focus in emerging infectious disease outbreaks, as lack of clarity regarding
the specifics of this route can obfuscate important details of outbreak dynamics.

Materials and Methods
A Waterborne, Abiotic, and other Indirectly Transmitted (WAIT) model for the
dynamics of emergent viral outbreaks. Several models have been engineered to
explore aspects of COVID-19 dynamics. For example, models have been used to
investigate the role of social distancing (2, 18), social mixing (19), the importance of
undocumented infections (20), the role of mobility in the early spread of disease in
China (21), and the potential for contact tracing as a solution (22). Only a few notable
models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission incorporate features of indirect or environmental
transmission (15, 16, 22), and none consider the dynamical properties of viral free-living
survival in the environment. Such a model structure would provide an avenue towards
exploring how variation in free-living survival influences disease outbreaks.
Environmental transmission models are aplenty in the literature and serve as a
theoretical foundation for exploring similar concepts in newer, emerging viruses (23-32).

Here, we parameterize and validate an SEIR-W model: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E),
Infectious (I), Recovered (R), and WAIT (W) model. Here W represents the
environmental component of the transmission cycle during the early stage of the SARS

CoV-2 pandemic. This model is derived from a framework previously developed called
the “WAIT” modeling framework—which stands for Waterborne, Abiotic, and other
Indirectly Transmitted—that incorporates an environmental reservoir where a pathogen
can sit and wait for hosts to interact with it (33, 34).

Building the SEIR-W model framework for SARS-CoV-2. Here W represents the
environmental component of the early stage of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic (Fig. S1).
This environmental compartment refers to reservoirs that people may have contact with
on a daily basis, such as doorknobs, tables, chairs, mail packages, and non-circulating
air indoors. The W compartment of our model represents the fraction of these
environmental reservoirs that house some sufficiently transmissible amount of infectious
virus. We emphasize that the W compartment is meant to only represent reservoirs that
are common sites for interaction with people. Thus, inclusion of the W compartment
allows us to investigate the degree to which the environment is infectious at any given
point, and its impact on the transmission dynamics of SARS CoV-2.

Model parameters are described in detail in Table 1. The system of equations in the
proposed mathematical model corresponding to these dynamics are defined in

Infection trajectories. In addition to including a compartment for the environment (W),
our model also deviates from traditional SEIR form by splitting the infectious
compartment into an IA-compartment (A for asymptomatic), and an IS-compartment (S
for symptomatic). As we discuss below, including asymptomatic (or sub-clinical)
transmission is both essential for understanding how we environmental—as opposed to
simply unobserved or hidden—transmission effects the ecological dynamics of
pathogens and also for analyzing SARS-CoV-2. The former represents an initial
infectious stage (following the non-infectious, exposed stage), from which individuals
will either move on to recovery directly (representing those individuals who experienced
mild to no symptoms) or move on to the IS-compartment (representing those with a
more severe response). Finally, individuals in the IS-compartment will either move on to
recovery or death due to the infection. This splitting of the traditional infectious
compartment is motivated by mounting evidence of asymptomatic transmission of
SARS CoV-2 (20, 36-39). Thus, we consider two trajectories for the course of the
disease, similar to those employed by (18): (1) E → IA → R and (2) E → IA → IS → R (or

death). More precisely, once in the E state, an individual will transition to the infectious
state IA, at a per-person rate of ε. A proportion p will move from IA to the recovered state

R (at a rate of p ⍵). A proportion (1 - p) of individuals in the IA state will develop more
severe systems and transition to Is (at a rate of (1 - p) ⍵). Individuals in the Is state
recover at a per-person rate of 𝜈 or die at a per-person rate μS. In each state, normal
mortality of the individual occurs at the per-person rate μ and newly susceptible (S)
individuals enter the population at a rate μN. The important differences between these
two trajectories are in how likely an individual is to move down one path or another, how
infectious individuals are (both for people and for the environment), how long individuals
spend in each trajectory, and how likely death is along each trajectory.

Clarification on the interactions between hosts and reservoirs. The model couples
the environment and people in two ways: (1) people can deposit the infectious virus to
environmental reservoirs (e.g. physical surfaces, and in the case of aerosols, the
ambient air) and (2) people can become infected by interacting with these reservoirs
(infecting the people). While the gist of our study is focused on physical surfaces, we
also include data and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 survival in aerosols. While aerosols
likely play a significant role in person-to-person transmission, they also facilitate an
indirect means of transmitting. For example, in indoor settings an infected individual can
deposit infectious SARS-CoV-2 into aerosols, which can then infect other individuals in
an indoor setting (41, 42). These can then remain suspended in the air, whereby other
individuals can become infected without ever having to be in especially close physical
proximity to the aerosol emitter (only requires that they interact with the same stagnant
air, containing infectious aerosol participates). In this setting, the free-living survival of

SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol form is a very relevant parameter in determining disease
dynamics.

Environmental reservoirs infect people through the βW term (equations 1 and 2), a proxy
for a standard transmission coefficient, corresponding specifically to the probability of
successful infectious transmission from the environment reservoir to a susceptible
individual (the full rate term being βWW·S). Hence, the βW factor is defined as the
fraction of people who interact with the environment daily, per fraction of the
environment, times the probability of transmitting infection from environmental reservoir
to people. The factor βWW (where W is the fraction of environmental reservoirs infected)
represents the daily fraction of people that will interact with the infected portion of the
environment and become infected themselves. The full term βWW·S is thus the total
number of infections caused by the environment per day.

In an analogous manner, we model the spread of infection to the environment with the
two terms 𝜎A IA·(1 - W) / N and 𝜎S IS·(1 - W) / N representing deposition of infection to
the environment by asymptomatic individuals, in the former, and symptomatic
individuals, in the latter. In this case, 𝜎A (and analogously for 𝜎S) gives the fraction of
surfaces/reservoirs that interact with people at least once per day, times the probability
that a person (depending on whether they are in the IA or the IS compartment) will
deposit an infectious viral load to the reservoir. Thus, 𝜎A IA / N and 𝜎S IS / N (where N is
the total population of people) represent the daily fraction of the environment that
interacts with asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Lastly, the

additional factor of (1 - W) gives the fraction of reservoirs in the environment that have
the potential for becoming infected, and so 𝜎A IA·(1 - W) / N (and analogously for IS)
gives the fraction of the environment that becomes infected by people each day. We
use W to represent a fraction of the environment, although one could also have
multiplied the W equation by a value representing the total number of reservoirs in the
environment (expected to remain constant throughout the course of the epidemic,
assuming no intervention strategies).

Parameter values estimation. Table 1 displays information on the population
definitions and initial values in the model. Tables 2 and 3 contain the fixed and
estimated values and their sources (respectively). Because this model iteration is
relatively underexplored with regards to COVID-19, we have worked to justify its use in
various ways. The model’s estimated parameters are based on model fits to 17
countries with the highest cumulative COVID-19 cases (of the 181 total countries
affected) as of 03/30/2020, who have endured outbreaks that had developed for at least
30 days following the first day with ≥10 cumulative infected cases within each country
(40) (See supplementary information Tables S1 – S3). In addition, we compare country
fits of the SEIR-W model to fits with a standard SEIR model. Lastly, we compare how
various iterations of these mathematical models compare to one another with regards to
the general model dynamics. For additional details, see the supplementary information.

Estimation of fixed parameters. There are 6 fixed parameters, 6 fitted parameters,
and one parameter (⍵) dependent on the values of one of the fixed parameters (𝜂) and

one of the fitted parameters (𝛆). These fixed parameters are 𝜂, 𝜇, 𝜇S, 𝜈, k, & p. The first,
𝜂, is the incubation period) (6, 43), and we assume that the expected time in the E state
(1/𝛆) and the expected time in the IA state (1/⍵) sums to 𝜂, i.e. 𝜂 = 1/𝛆 + 1/⍵. Fixing 𝜂
constrains one of the two parameters, 𝛆 or ⍵, and the other can be fitted; we choose to
fit 𝛆 and therefore constrain ⍵. The second fixed parameter 𝜇, the normal death rate,
was calculated by taking the reciprocal of the average life expectancy (in days) of the 17
countries sampled, weighted by population size. We calculated a value of 80.3 years,
based on data from individual countries (44). The third parameter 𝜇S is the sum of the
normal death rate and an additional death rate due to a more severe form of the
infection. We assumed a death rate of 3.8% (43) and that death follows after initial
symptoms between 3 and 4 weeks (43). Thus 𝜇S = 𝜇 + 0.038/(3.5 * 7), where we use
the average of 3 and 4 weeks and we convert to days with the factor of 7. The fourth
fixed parameter 𝜈, the recovery rate once in the symptomatic state, was assumed to be
the reciprocal of the average of 3 and 6 weeks (the range of recovery times) (4, 43)
times the fraction of individuals in the symptomatic state that do not die, i.e. 1 - 0.038,
so 𝜈 = (1 - 0.038)/(4.5 * 7). The fifth fixed parameter k, the rate of viral decay in the
environment, is the reciprocal of the average time that SARS-CoV-2 is expected to
survive in the environment across a set of abiotic reservoirs, based empirical
measurements (22). The sixth fixed parameter p, the fraction of individuals in the IA
state that move on to recovery without experiencing severe symptoms, was taken to be
0.956 (2).

We fit our model variations to the daily new cases data provided (See: supplementary
information) starting on the day when there were ≥10 cumulative infected cases in that
region. We choose the starting point of 10 cumulative cases in order to allow the
outbreak to settle into a more consistent doubling time while also providing enough of
an early-on window to capture the dynamics relevant to the ℛ0 and force of infection
estimations.

We calculate the number of daily new infections in our model by numerically integrating
the influx rate of new symptomatic infections over the course of a single day (i.e. ∫ (1 - p)

⍵ IA dt). We perform this calculation for each of 30 consecutive days and fit these
values to the daily new cases data. We use the influx rate of symptomatic infections, as
opposed to the total rate of new infection (including asymptomatic individuals), as we
expect that the large majority of reported cases in the early COVID-19 outbreak to be
symptomatic. And we expect that—in the outbreaks—almost all asymptomatic cases go
unreported (20).

Initial conditions. For each country, we use the first cumulative count that is ≥10 as a
proxy for the initial number of active symptomatic cases IS0. We can justify this by
proposing that, given that the doubling time is expected to fall between 3 and 6 days
(45) then the exponential growth rate parameter of the infection (r in exp(rt)) would fall
between 0.231 days-1 and 0.116 days-1 respectively. And, assuming 1 initial infected
individual, the time to reach 10 cases for the former rate would be about 10.0 days
(~log(10)/0.231) and the time for the latter would be 19.8 days (~log(10)/0.116). Thus,

since recovery of symptomatic individuals, which takes between 3 and 6 weeks (39, 43)
exceeds this interval, we expect that at the point when 10 cases have accumulated, all
cases are still active. Lastly, in fitting the data to our model, we initialize all fitting
parameters to a value of 1.5, in whatever units are appropriate for that parameter
(expected to be close to the true value for most of the fitting parameters).
As an estimate for the initial number active asymptomatic cases, we take IA0 = IS0. That
is, we expect that there are approximately as many asymptomatic cases as
symptomatic cases early on. This assumption appears to be consistent with empirical
findings. For example, data from the Diamond Princess cruise liner (11, 46), where all
passengers were tested, revealed that approximately half of positively-testing cases
were asymptomatic. Lastly, we assumed that the initial number of exposed individuals
was approximately ℛ0· (IA0 + IS0), based on the supposition that each of the initially
infectious individuals (IA0 + IS0) will have exposed the infection to approximately ℛ0 other
individuals. We take the value of ℛ0 in this case to be 2.5, based on prior studies (18,
20). The R population is assumed to be 0 in the early stage of the outbreak, given the
(average) 3 to 6-week recovery delay of COVID-19. The W population is assumed to be
1%.

Basic reproductive ratios (ℛ0). We can express the ℛ0 (eq. 7) in a form that makes
explicit the contributions from the environment and from person-to-person interactions.
In this way, the full ℛ0 is observed to comprise two ℛ0 sub-components: one the number
of secondary infections caused by a single infected person through person-to-person
contact alone (Rp) and the other is the number of secondary infections caused by
exchanging infection with the environment (Re).

where Rp and Re are defined in equations 8a and 8b.

(8a, 8b)

Note that when Rp = 0, the ℛ0 reduces to Re and when Re = 0, the ℛ0 reduces to Rp.
Thus, when person-to-person transmission is set to zero, the ℛ0 consists only of terms
associated with transmission from the environment, and when transmission from the
environment is set to zero, the ℛ0 consists only of infection directly between people.
When both routes of transmission are turned on, the two ℛ0-components combine in the
manner in equation 7.

While Re represents the component of the ℛ0 formula associated with infection from the
environment, the square of this quantity Re2 represents the expected number of people
who become infected in the two-step infection process: people → environment → people,

representing the flow of infection from people to the environment, and then from the
environment to people. Thus, while Rp gives the expected number of people infected by
a single infected person when the environmental transmission is turned off, Re2 gives
the expected number of people infected by a single infected person by way of the
environmental route exclusively

no direct person-to-person transmission). Also note that Re2/(Re2 + Rp) can be used to
measure the extent of transmission that is mediated by the environment exclusively.
This proportion can be used as a proxy for how important environmental transmission is
in a given setting. Elaboration on formulas 8a-b—and associated derivationdiscussions—appear in the supplementary information.

Results
The results section covers the following sets of tests and analyses:
1. The process through which parameters were estimated through fits to country-level
outbreak data.
2. Sensitivity analysis, to discuss how variation in parameters influences key aspects of
virus transmission dynamics.
3. An examination of how mathematical model incorporates environmental
transmission. We discuss a calculation of the proportion of the transmission in a given
setting can be attributed to environmental transmission.

value is set to one of the environmental settings for which there are published findings
(12). This is designed to identify how hypothetical settings comprising SARS-CoV-2
environmental transmission of a certain kind influences disease dynamics.

Establishing features of environmental transmission using country outbreak data.
Using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), SEIR models with an environmental
compartment (SEIR-W) provide a strong relative fit to country incidence data. As
discussed in the Methods, we compared the performance of models with (SEIR-W) and
without (SEIR) environmental transmission across multiple countries to assess the role
of environmental transmission in different contexts. Using the fitted parameters provided
in Tables 1-3, and S1-S3, we calculate AIC values for the two mechanistic models: the
standard SEIR model and the SEIR-W model. Table S4 displays the summary of the
AIC values for each model-type fit to the first 30 days after the first day with total counts
≥10. In 10/17 countries (including 9/11 European countries), the SEIR-W model
provided a better fit to the country data. In Fig. 1, we display the comparative individual
country fit results for 4 of the countries with the fastest 30-day case growth rates—
Spain, Italy, Iran, and Switzerland. The SEIR-W variant provides a better fit (significantly
lower AIC score) than the standard SEIR model for all of these. Note that, as features of
independent country epidemics are myriad and difficult to disentangle, several aspects
independent of the model structure could explain the superior fit of the SEIR-W models.
Results for additional country fits can be found in the supplementary information, Fig.

Sensitivity analysis reveals how environmental transmission can modulate
disease dynamics. Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) analyses for the four
examined features of the outbreak—(i) ℛ0, (ii) total number of infected individuals after
30 days, (iii) time to peak number of infected individuals, and (iii) size of peak number of
infected individuals. Fig. 2 demonstrates the PRCC calculations for all four of these
outbreak characteristics. For ℛ0, we observe that the model was strongly sensitive to
several aspects related to virus transmission— βA, βS, βw——as well as the rate at which
asymptomatic individuals develop symptoms (⍵), the rate of recovery (𝜈) and SARSCoV-2 free-living survival rate (k).

One can also observe how some parameters are better suited to modify the peak of the
infection, such as the recovery rate (𝜈; which includes in it the swiftness of diagnosing
and treating the virus). Others modulate the timing of the peak, such as ε, the rate of
leaving the “exposed” compartment (or equally well, the reciprocal of the average time
spent in the exposed compartment). Note that across all features, the fraction of cases
that move along the “mild” route (p), from E→IA→R, has a powerful influence on all
factors.

The model emerging virus’ ℛ0 comprises person-to-person and environmental
transmission. In the Methods, we described how the ℛ0 is composed of two sub-ℛ0
components, corresponding to different infectious interactions: person to person (Rp),
person to environment and environment to person (Re). Tornado plots were constructed

that demonstrate how the ℛ0-components have their own architecture and sensitivity
(Fig. 3).

In Fig. 4, we observe how variation in free-living survival (1/k) influences four
characteristics of an outbreak: ℛ0, total number of infected individuals after 30 days,
time to peak number of infected and symptomatic individuals, and maximum number of
symptomatic individuals in the first 30 days. Note the annotations on the figure that
highlight where the empirically-determined survival times of SARS-CoV-2 on a range of
reservoir types (aerosol, copper, plastic, cardboard, stainless steel) (12). Also note that
the quantitative relationships between 1/k and various outbreak features are slightly
different. For example, the ℛ0 increases more gradually across a wider range of freeliving survival values than some of the other features (Fig. 4).

We should reemphasize some aspects of the underlying physics of the simulations in
this study that were introduced in the Methods section. In reality aerosol transmission
likely contributes to person-to-person transmission. There, however, scenarios where
aerosols serve as environmental reservoir, capable of transmitting between individuals
in an “indirect” way. In this study, we use it in an analogous way to surfaces, where air
may be exchanged in the same room where infected individuals were, rather than
exchanging infectious particles on a surface.

The composition of abiotic reservoirs modulates outbreak dynamics. Fig. 5
depicts the results of “reservoir world” simulations, where the k values correspond to
those from a 2020 study highlighting the survival of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 on
different physical surfaces (12). The summary of these simulations (Fig. 5) highlights
that the surface composition of a setting has a meaningful impact on several features of
outbreak dynamics. Of the “reservoir world” simulations, “aerosol world” (5a) and
“copper world” (Fig. 5c) takes the longest amount of time (91.5 and 88.4 days,
respectively) to rise to the peak number of infected-symptomatic individuals, indicating
an outbreak which is slower to develop. Relatedly, the ℛ0 values are much different in
the different “reservoir world” scenarios: The “aerosol world” simulation has an ℛ0 of
2.38, the “copper world” simulation an ℛ0 of 2.4, and the “plastic world” simulation an ℛ0
of 3.18 (Fig. 6 and Table S5). In addition, the total number of individuals infected after
30 days of the outbreak, and the total number dead after 30 days are both significantly
lower in the “aerosol world” and “copper world” setting (Fig. 6 and Table S5). The peak
value of infected individuals is not dramatically different across “reservoir worlds.” That
is, while many features associated with severity differ greatly across “reservoir world”
settings, we observed significantly less variation in the peak of the epidemic as
compared with the time to the peak of the epidemic (Table S5). Maybe the most
noteworthy of the differences is the vast disparity in the number of deaths in the first 30
days of the outbreak, where the “plastic world” setting has more than 30 times the
number of deaths as the “copper world” scenario (1,814 vs. 55, respectively; Fig. 6 and
Table S5).

Lastly, comparisons of the metric, Re2/(Re2 + Rp), which measures the extent to which
transmissions can be attributed to the environmental route, further highlights how
different environmental reservoirs influence disease transmission (Fig. 6). The “aerosol
world” and “copper world” settings comprise 4.6% and 6% of transmission events
occurring through non-person to person transmission. This differs dramatically from the
“plastic world” setting, where 52% of transmission events are occurring through the
environmental route.

Discussion
Deconstructing the basic reproductive number (ℛ0) into subcomponent reveals
the role of environmental transmission. By deconstructing the basic reproductive
number into components, we can better understand how variation in the ℛ0—by setting,
time, or geography—may reside in how these contexts are driven by environmental
transmission. Many of these effects may be (as they are in this study) localized to one
component of the ℛ0, labeled Re2 in this study. Notably, the Re2 component is highly
sensitive to the transmission interaction between people and the environment (𝛃w), and
the decay rate of virus in the environment (k). Interestingly, the Re2 is relatively robust to
the rate of infectious virus shed into the environment from the asymptomatic infected
individuals (the parameter called σA in this model). Also, deconstructing the ℛ0 value
into these components facilitates the creation of new metrics that quantify how much a
given epidemic is driven by certain routes. As many viral diseases may contain multiple
transmission routes, being able to properly quantify their relative contribution may be
useful for public health interventions.

Determining the role of viral free-living survival on disease transmission should
be the focus of early inquiry in the ecology of any emerging infectious disease. In
this study, we introduce a general framework for studying the joint effects of direct and
indirect microparasite transmission and then analyzed that model using data from
SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that understanding the particulars of environmental
transmission, including variation in viral free-living survival, can alter fundamental
characteristics of disease dynamics. For SARS-CoV-2, we find that across 17
countries, the SEIR-W model better explained the epidemiological patterns than did
SEIR models. Critically, the SEIR model included asymptomatic/sub-clinical
transmission. Given that features of environmental transmission can influence central
properties of disease dynamics, we should consider the possibility that variation in freeliving survival may contribute to variation in aspects of disease dynamics. Nevertheless,
that the SEIR-W model fits certain country data relative to others may be the
consequence of many characteristics of an epidemic (e.g. quality of data, testing
capacity), none of which represents anything meaningful about the mechanism of an
outbreak. Indeed, the model is strongly sensitive to several aspects related to virus
transmission, including the rate at which both symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals transmit infection to susceptible hosts, the rate at which asymptomatic
individuals develop symptoms, the rate of recovery (𝜈) and SARS-CoV-2 decay rate (k).

Disease dynamics in different hypothetical “reservoir world” settings resemble
essentially different outbreaks. Analysis of the ℛ0 and its subcomponents highlights
that many aspects of outbreak dynamics are sensitive to the parameter associated with

environmental decay rate (k in the model presented in this study). Analysis of
hypothetical settings purely comprising reservoirs of a certain kind (“reservoir world”)
fortifies the significance of free-living survival on physical surfaces and environmental
transmission in outbreak dynamics. While our findings cannot speak to the outbreak
dynamics in any particular setting in the real world, they do reveal that the surface
composition of a setting can significantly influence the behavior of an outbreak. For
example, the ℛ0 in the “plastic world” simulation (ℛ0 = 3.18) is over 1.3 times the ℛ0 in
the “copper world” simulation (ℛ0 = 2.4). Many other differences between these
outbreaks come as a consequence of the different ℛ0 values. For example, the “plastic
world” simulation reaches a peak number of symptomatic infectious individuals almost
1.7 times faster than the “copper world” simulation, and kills over 30 times more people
in the first 30 days (1,814 deaths in “plastic world” vs. 55 deaths in the “plastic world”).

These differences are so significant that they might be naively interpreted as completely
different outbreaks early on in an outbreak. Note, however, that the maximum value of
the infected- symptomatic populations are roughly equivalent across “reservoir worlds,”
and so the influence of SARS-CoV-2 survival on physical surfaces (mediated by
difference in free-living survival) doesn’t affect all aspects of outbreak dynamics equally.

Despite the breadth of differences observed across surfaces, a very notable finding
regards the similarity between the “aerosol world” and “copper world” results. That is, an
outbreak in a hypothetical world where there are no physical surfaces, but only
transmission via aerosols would be only slightly more intense than an outbreak where

indirect transmission was driven entirely by copper (using ℛ0 as a quick proxy, “aerosol
world” = 2.38, and “copper world” = 2.4). The implications here are subtle, but worth
elaborating on: while a lot of public debate has focused on a dichotomy between
aerosol-mediated transmission and environmental transmission, our findings suggest
that the differences between aerosol transmission and some physical surfaces is so
minute that the epidemiological signature for differences between them may be
indistinguishable. Consequently, the more productive debates would focus, not on
whether environmental transmission is occurring at all, but how the combination of
aerosols and surfaces contribute to non-contact transmission events.

Implications for the ecology of emerging outbreaks. As of June 1, 2020, the
scientific community remains in the fact-finding phase of SARS-CoV-2 biology and
COVID-19 understanding. A significant source of fear and speculation in the pandemic
involves the plausibility that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone local adaptation in certain
settings, translating to different epidemiological properties. While there is no currently
convincing molecular or clinical support for local adaptation in SARS-CoV-2, our
findings highlight how easy it is to conflate an environmental (or ecological) difference
for a genetic one: the same virus, spreading in populations of identical size and
behavior, differing only in the composition of physical surfaces where the virus can be
transmitted through the environment, can have ℛ0 values between 2.4 and 3.18, with
early death rates 30 times apart. Even further, our findings highlight how models of
direct and indirect/environmental transmission can provide comparable results,
rendering it easy to conflate routes of transmission. This is related to a problem known

as the identifiability problem that arises when models are fit to early outbreak data (48).

These difficulty in predicting outbreaks conferred by this identifiability problem, and the
generic variability in disease dynamics from setting to setting has been encapsulated in
a concept called permutation entropy (49). Even more, environmental reservoirs
composed of certain physical surfaces (plastic-like in our model) may be associated
with phenomenon resembling a “superspreading” event, where individual variation in
contagiousness can drive unusually large numbers of infections (50). Perhaps a better
understanding of how, and on what surfaces, viral populations survive may one day
improve the predictability of outbreak trajectories.

Because of the identifiability problem, and a general lack of consensus regarding the
mechanisms of transmission in various diseases, we caution against the
overextrapolation of these findings to any particular epidemic. As of July 2020, the
evidence for widespread surface transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains dubious. Insofar
as SARS-CoV-2 is not the last of the emerging infectious diseases, then we should
remain vigilant about understanding how different routes of transmission may influence
disease dynamics. This is especially true because there remain other microparasites
(viral and other) in human and nonhuman hosts that are transmitted via the
environmental route that will continue to require our attention.

Fig; 1. Illustrative model fit comparisons for SEIR-W and standard SEIR to case
counts in early windows of the outbreak. The model fits are comparable across four
countries with the largest early epidemics. These were chosen based having the highest
cumulative number of infected cases after 30 days, following the first day when case
counts were greater than or equal to 10. The four countries are (a,b) Spain, (c,d) Italy,
(e,f) Iran and (g,h) Switzerland. These constitute a subset of 17 countries that had the
highest number of cumulative COVID-19 cases (of the 181 total countries affected) as
of March 30, 2020. Data come from the European Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention, and from ourworldindata.org (40, 47). See supplementary information for
more details.

Fig 2. A Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) sensitivity analysis. PRCC
was performed with respect to (A) ℛ0, (B) total number of infected (and symptomatic)
after 30 days of outbreak, (C) time to peak number of symptomatic individuals (tmax),
and (D) peak number of symptomatic individuals. This analysis highlights the
intercorrelated sensitivities of each of the model parameters. The blue bars show the
mean value of each PRCC, with error bars at one standard deviation. This analysis was
performed by sampling over uniform distributions of 4.5% around the nominal model
parameter values. Parameters correspond to the fixed ones in Table 3, and the average
fitted parameters values in Table S5. The red line marks PRCC values of +/- 0.50 and
helps identify parameters that are more influential (greater than 0.50 or less than 0.50). See supplementary information for more details.

Fig.3. ℛ0 subcomponents have different parameter architecture. We compare the
parameter architecture for the two ℛ0 components that compose the full ℛ0 expression,
(a) Rp, (b) Re2 and (c) ℛ0. Parameters are colored according to their relation with the
environment or people: green parameters refer to the environment, blue parameters
strictly refer to people, and black parameters are neutral in this regard. Black bars show
the extent to which the component after changed when the parameter values are
increased by 4.5%, The white bars show the same except for a decrease of 4.5%. For
clarity, the single parameter that most influences the ℛ0 and its subcomponents is the
faction of cases that move through the mild route (p) has been removed. For more
details on how this parameter influences the ℛ0 and other features of the outbreak, see
the PRCC analysis as discussed in the Methods and supplementary information.

Fig. 4. Environmental transmission: Various features of an outbreak change as a
function of 1/k (where k is the rate of decay of SARS-CoV-2 survival in the
environmental compartment): to (A) ℛ0, (B) total number of infected (and symptomatic)
after 30 days of outbreak, (C) time to peak number of symptomatic individuals (tmax),
and (D) peak number of symptomatic individuals. The black dashed lines show the
value of the respective plotted value at the average value of 1/k (~ 1.5 days), used in
the fits from above. The top red line shows the maximum of plotted value for either the
smallest value of 1/k chosen ( = 1 hr) or the largest value of 1/k chosen ( = 3 days),
depending on whether the plotted value decreases or increases with 1/k, and the
bottom red line shows the plotted value at the other extreme of 1/k. We emphasize that
these correspond to indirect, environmental transmission only. Aerosol transmission, for
example, is likely a cause of direct transmission between individuals.

Fig. 5. Hypothetical “reservoir world” simulations feature differing environmental
transmission dynamics. Population and environmental dynamics of SEIR-W model
outbreaks in hypothetical settings composed of pure substances where SARS-CoV-2
can survive and be transmitted. (A, B) “aerosol world,” (C, D) “copper world,” “ (E, F)
cardboard world,” (G, H) “stainless steel world,” and (I, J) “plastic world.” Environment
infectiousness corresponds to the proportion of the environment that contains infectious
SARS-CoV-2. Note that the surface where the viral decay is strongest (Copper), the
peak of the epidemic is pushed farthest from the origin. Also note the ℛ0 values graphs
A, C, E, and G, which highlight that the different “reservoir worlds” behave like
fundamentally different outbreaks in several ways.

measures. Graphs correspond to the attributes of simulated epidemics where
environments are entirely composed of a given physical surface, and larger values
correspond to various aspects of outbreak intensity. A) ℛ0, (B) total number of infected
(and symptomatic) after 30 days of outbreak, (C) the inverse time to peak number of
symptomatic individuals (tmax-1; larger values = shorter times to reach peak), (D) peak
number of symptomatic individuals, (E) deaths after 30 days, and (F) environmental
transmission fraction. Note the log scales on the y-axis in (B), (D) and (E).
