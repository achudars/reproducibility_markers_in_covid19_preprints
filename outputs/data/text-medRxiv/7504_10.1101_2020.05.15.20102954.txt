Abstract
This work describes the mathematical modelling and dynamics of a novel Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kenya. The mathematical model assumes Human-Human
infection as well as Human-Pathogen interaction. Using the SEIR
(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model with additional
component of the pathogen,we simulated the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak and
impact of different control measures. The resulting system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) are directly solved using a combination of fourth and fifth-order
Runge-Kutta methods. Simulation results indicate that non-pharmaceutical measures
such as school closure, social distancing and movement restriction emphatically flatten
the epidemic peak curve hence leading to a smaller number of overall disease cases.

Introduction
COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is a newly
emergent virus that has attracted alot of scientific research. The first reported case
began in mainland China, City of Wuhan, Hubei on 29th December 2019. [1]. Later on,
the novel disease began to spread to countries in contact with China resulting to WHO
declaring it as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30
January 2020 [2]. As of 17th April 2020 the number of reported confirmed cases had
exceeded two million [3]. The United States of America (USA) was on the lead with
infections while Italy followed put. Africa was also affected by imported cases that
resulted to the first Kenyan case being reported on the 13th of March 2020 [4].
The three main types of infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic, pre-asymptomatic
and symptomatic. The incubation period for COVID-19 in the pre-assymptomatic
infectious group, which is the time between exposure to the virus (becoming infected)
and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, however it can be up to 14 days. During
this period some infected persons can be contagious. In a symptomatic COVID-19 case,
the disease manifests itself with signs and symptoms. Asymptomatic transmission refers
to transmission of the virus from a person, who does not develop symptoms [5]. The

basic reproductive number, defined as the average number of secondary infections
produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is
susceptible [6], is affected by the rate of contacts in the host population, the probability
of infection being transmitted during contact and the duration of infectiousness. The
basic reproductive number for COVID-19 in Kenya ranges from 1.78(95%CI 1.44-2.14)
to 3.46 (95%CI 2.81-4.17) [7].
The outbreak is thought to spread through a population via direct contact with
infectious individuals [8] or cross transmission through pathogen contamination in the
environment. Specifically, the virus is primarily spread between people during close
contact,often via small droplets produced by coughing,sneezing, or
talking [9] [10] [5] [6] [13]. After breathing out produces these droplets, they usually fall
to the ground or on to surfaces rather than remain in the air over long
distances [9] [6] [7]. People may also become infected by touching a contaminated
surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. [9] [10]. The virus can survive on
surfaces for up to 72 hours [13].
This kind of transmission has had adverse social and economic impact because all
segments of the population are significantly affected. The disease is particularly
detrimental to vulnerable social groups such as older age-groups, persons with
disabilities and people with other underlying diseases. If the pandemic is not properly
addressed through policy, the social crisis generated from COVID-19 could also increase
inequality, exclusion, discrimination and global unemployment in the medium and long
term [11]. Inorder to achieve suitable control measures of COVID-19, an accurate SEIR
mathematical prediction model is required. Regrettably, this can only be obtained after
the outbreak ends since the prediction trends are largely influenced by each country’s
policy and social responsibility [12].
Mathematical models can help us to understand how SARS-CoV-2 could spread across
the population and inform control measures that might mitigate future
transmission [13]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions based on sustained physical
distancing have a strong potential to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak of
COVID-19 and lead to a smaller number of overall cases. In the absence of a vaccine
social distancing has become the most appropriate Non Pharmaceutical Intervention
(NPIs) [14]. Lowering and flattening of the epidemic peak is paramount, as this reduces
the acute pressure on the health-care system. Premature and sudden lifting of
interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by
relaxing the interventions gradually [15].
According to the WHO/China Joint Mission Report, 80% of laboratory-confirmed cases
in China up to 20 February 2020 have had mild-to moderate disease – including both
non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases; whilst 13.8% developed severe disease and 6.1%
developed to a critical stage requiring intensive care [16]. It is therefore paramount to
come up with an epidemiological model that factors in hospitalization of the mild to
moderate cases and severity of the disease.
In a recent study we explored an SEIR-P model that incorporates human behavior
during the disease outbreak, such as ignorance of social distancing so as to advise health
experts was developed. The model also accounted for individuals with robust
immune [17]. The model in this study is different because (i) It does not include
individuals with robust immunities because this research has not been fully concluded.
(ii) Compartments of hospitalized population H(t), human population in Intensive Care
Unit U (t) and the fatalities D(t) have been added to the SEIR-P model so as to
account for the aforementioned dynamics [16]. (iii)It investigates the effects of lifting
non-Pharmaceutical interventions such as school closure, physical distancing and
lockdown on the model. It is envisaged that the dynamics of the results shall inform
health experts in their research of efficient and effective ways of flattening the curve.

Materials and methods
Model formulation
In this study a human-Pathogen SEIR-P model for COVID-19 outbreak is formulated.
The model considers a short-time period thereby ignoring the demographics of births
and natural death. The total human population is subdivided into the susceptible
human beings S(t), the exposed human beings E(t), the asymptomatic infectious
population IA (t), the symptomatic infectious population IM (t), the critical infectious
population IC (t), the hospitalized population H(t) in ordinary wards and U (t) in
Intensive Care Unit, the fatalities D(t) and the recovered population R(t). The
Pathogen vector in the environment is denoted by P (t).

Disease Free Equilibrium (DFE) and Basic Reproduction
Number
In the DFE there are no infections from the humans nor the pathogens such that
S = N . This implies that P = IA = IM = IC = U = H = 0 which further implies that
E = D = R = 0.
The Basic Reproduction Number R0 , is defined as the average number of secondary
infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is
susceptible [6]. This number is affected by the rate of contacts in the host population,
the probability of infection being transmitted during contact and the duration of
infectiousness. The next generation matrix method is used to obtain the R0 .

Results and Discussion
A cure or vaccine for COVID-19 is yet to be discovered. Therefore, the interventions
being carried out are non-pharmaceutical and include measures such as contact tracing,
quarantine, social distancing, wearing of face masks, and hand washing. Mass testing
and effective contact tracing has been a great challenge in low-income countries.
Therefore, these countries have adopted social distancing measures such as closure of
schools, reducing sizes of gatherings, minimizing contact in workplaces, and imposing
curfews. The main aim of such interventions is to flatten the curve i.e. prevent infection
from spreading fast and bring down the number of infected cases. Curve flattening is
necessary because it avoids overwhelming the health systems and gives them time to
develop treatment mechanisms.
A key factor in slowing infection spread is reduction of the basic reproduction number
R0 , which is expressed in terms of the rates of new infections β1 ,β2 , and β3 . Thus, we
implement the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) by multiplying the rates of
infections by a 20% and 30% factor. The interpretation is that the NPIs yield an overall
mitigation of the epidemic spread by 20% and 30% respectively. An attack rate of 67%
was assumed. This led to considering total population N as the product of attack rate
and the total population of Kenya, which is approximately 5.02 × 107 . An identification
rate p of the new infectious cases was determined as the ratio of confirmed cases over
the total number of tested individuals. At the time of this study p was 0.02, while the
parameter values were taken as shown in Table 1 above. The simulation was initialized
at date 13-3-2020 and run for 365 days with the initial values IA (0) = 2, IM (0) = 2,
IC (0) = 2, and P (0) = 5, 000, while the other variables (except S(0)) were initially set
to 0.
The results of the infectious (IA + IM + IC ) and hospitalized (H + U ) cases in
Kenya are shown in Figure 2, and epidemic peak values and dates are depicted in Table
2. In unmitigated situation, the peak arrives rather quickly, in about 4 months probably
due to the asymptomatics significantly contributing to the epidemic spread. We note
that the Kenyan population is largely comprised of youth, who are majorly presumed to
be an asymptomatic population. Our model predicts that if the overall control measures
achieves 20% effectiveness in slowing the spread of COVID-19, then a delay of slightly 2
months is realized, which allows the health care systems time of gathering resources to
manage the epidemic. Consequently, the reported infectious and hospitalized cases are
reduced by more than 50%. However, there is a likelihood of exceeding the health
capacities. A 30% effectiveness of the applied NPIs substantially bring the epidemic
further down, and as noted in Figure 3 the simulated cumulative infectious cases
largely coincides with the data of COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya. Moreover, this
particular mitigation effort reduce the cumulative infectious cases from just under
700,000 down to around 450,000 cases by date 13-Mar-2021. A similar reduction is also
seen in the cumulative number of hospitalized cases. Moreover, the cumulative deaths
attains a more than 50% reduction, from about 6,000 cases in unmitigated situation to
around 3,500 cases in the 30% mitigation scenario. Majority of deaths emanate from
those already in intensive care unit (ICU) U , which is presumably overwhelmed by the
many critically ill patients arising from H and IC populations. The inability to access
the limited ICU resources results to additional deaths from H and IC populations.
The control measures were put in place for the entire simulation time, so there was
no rebound of the infections. A strong one-time social distancing measure would not
sufficiently prevent overwhelming of the health care capacities, since it keeps a
significant number of the population in susceptible compartment such that a rebound in
infections, after the measure has been lifted, will lead to an epidemic wave that
surpasses the capacity. Moreover, previous studies have shown that intermittent
application of the NPIs maintains the infections within the health care capacities, but

Fig 2. Left panels depicts simulation of infectious and hospitalized cases, in
unmitigated and mitigated situations. The implementation of NPIs results to a delay
and significant reduction in the cases, as shown by the varying peaks. Right panels
show the simulated cumulative cases for both infectious and hospitalized individuals.
The infectious cases comprise of individuals in compartments IA , IM , and IC cases.The
hospitalized cases comprise of individuals in compartments H and U .

Fig 3. Left panel depicts the data of the confirmed cases in Kenya against the
simulated infectious cases for the first 60 days, in unmitigated and mitigated situations.
The simulated results of a 30% NPIs effectiveness coincides with the data. Right panel
show the cumulative deaths, which decline significantly as the NPIs take effect.

Conclusion
An SEIR-P compartmental model has been used to study the spread of COVID-19. The
model accounts for both human to human and human-environment interactions. The
model simulations underscores the fact that NPIs such as school closure, social
distancing and movement restriction emphatically delay or flatten the epidemic peak.
