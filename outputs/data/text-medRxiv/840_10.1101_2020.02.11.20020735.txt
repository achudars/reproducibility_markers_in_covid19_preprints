Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles in English, between 1 Jan 1980, and 1 Jan 2020,
using the search terms 1) (infection OR infectious disease* OR outbreaks) AND (modelling); and 2)
(mask* OR facemask* OR medical resource*) AND (infection OR infectious disease* OR outbreaks).
Most relevant studies identified were performed to predict diseases spread and to determine the original
infection source of previous epidemics like SARS and H7N9. However, few studies focused on the
medical resources crisis during the outbreaks.

Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel
coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management
strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three
scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December
2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed
that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage
would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the
whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health
measures.

Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings provide insight into the public health measures to confront medical resources crisis during
infectious disease outbreaks. Effective public health measures should consider the adequacy and
affordability of existing medical resources. Governments across the world should revisit their emergency
plans for controlling infectious disease outbreaks by taking into account the supply of and demand for
the medical resource. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global
pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.

Abstract
Background
A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in China in
late-December 2019. Facemask wearing is considered as one of the most cost-effective and important
measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent
global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of
global production. However, even full productivity (20 million facemasks per day) does not seem to
meet the need of a population of 1·4 billion in China.

Methods
Policy review using government websites and shortage analysis using mathematical modelling based
on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology (MIIT), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the People’s
Republic of China, and Wuhan Bureau of Statistics.

Findings
Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers
and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province.
However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5
days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected
by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase
in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of
April.

Interpretation
In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can
considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures
should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should
be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing
the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.

Introduction
An increasing number of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were initially identified in
Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was mainly
transmitted via respiratory droplets and can be transmitted between humans 1-3. Common symptoms of
COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia or fatigue, while less common symptoms
include sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea 4. In mid-February 2020, the
reported incidence of COVID-19 cases exceeded 60,000 in China, of which more than 70% was in
Wuhan city and more than 80% was in Hubei province 5,6. Globally, Thailand, Japan, South Korea,
Singapore, Malaysia, France, Canada, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and
13 other countries had reported COVID-19 cases 7. Most of the confirmed cases are travellers from or
ever been to Wuhan or other Chinese cities; however, locally transmitted cases outside of China have
also been reported 7.
The World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidance on prevention and control of the COVID-19
outbreak recommends hand, and respiratory hygiene and the use of appropriate personal protective
equipment for healthcare workers in practice and patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection
should be offered a medical mask 8. Regarding the respiratory hygiene measures, facemask wearing is
considered as one of the most cost-effective and important measures to prevent the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent global facemask shortage 9-12.
China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of the global production 9. At
the usual time, China can produce 20 million facemasks per day while the productivity during the
Chinese New Year holiday was lower (12 million facemasks per day) 13. However, even full
productivity does not seem to meet the need of a population of 1·4 billion in China. Therefore, to
control the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government imported more than 730 million facemasks
between 24 Jan 2020 and 11 Feb 2020 13,14 and extended the Chinese New Year holiday to allow for
home quarantine and to reduce the need for facemasks and other medical resources. A number of
factories also resumed partial productivity during the holiday by paying extra to their workers 15.
In this study, we simulated the facemask availability during the COVID-19 outbreak using a
mathematical model based on the actual development of the outbreak, public health measures
introduced by the Chinese government, and national statistics on facemask production and import. We
aim to investigate the situation of the facemask shortage during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and
reflect on the existing public health measures. This analysis could provide insight into the development
of emergency plans regarding the adequacy and affordability of medical resources for future infectious
disease outbreaks.

A cluster of COVID-19 cases was reported by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in late Dec
2019 1, and the peak of the epidemic is predicted to be between mid-to-late-February based on data
from Wuhan while the epidemic is predicted to fade out within two months after the peak 16,17. The
number of new cases is expected to decline after the epidemic peak, but the viral transmission is still
possible and the need for facemask will not decrease immediately. Therefore, our analysis covered the
period from 31 Dec 2019 to 30 Apr 2020 (121 days in total). To simulate the facemask availability in
China, we used a mathematical model based on data and assumptions on the production, import, and
need. We considered three scenarios in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in 1) Wuhan city (the
epicenter); 2) Hubei province (the province/state where the epicenter is located); and 3) the whole of
China (the entire country).
Mathematical model
We simulated the daily facemasks availability using equation (1),

where Fa(d) is the facemasks availability, as defined as the total number of facemasks on the market and
in storage at the end of day d. Fa(0) (i.e., d=1) is the baseline facemask availability at the beginning of
our prediction period. Fp(d) is the number of facemasks produced in China on day d. Fi(d) is the
number of facemasks imported to China on day d. Fn(d) is the need for facemasks on day d.
We estimated the daily need for facemasks using equations (2) to (4),

where Fn,h(d) and Fn,g(d) are the need for facemasks among healthcare workers and the general
population on day d in the disease epidemic region, respectively. α and β are the daily need for
facemasks of one healthcare worker and one person in the general population in the disease epidemic
region, respectively. Nh and Ng are the numbers of healthcare workers and the general population in the
disease epidemic region, respectively. Pg(d) is the percentage of the general population in the disease
epidemic region need facemasks on day d.

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the People’s Republic of China, and Municipal Health
Commission.
The parameters included in the mathematical model were estimated based on the data released by the
NHC, MIIT, and CDC of the People’s Republic of China or recent investigation on the outbreak.
Model input and assumptions in our model are summarized in Table 1. Specifically, the population and
the numbers of healthcare workers in Wuhan city, Hubei province, and China were obtained from the
Wuhan Bureau of Statistics and China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019 18-20. MIIT estimated that the
daily facemask production in China is about 20 million at usual time 13. Facemask storage was
estimated to be seven times the daily consumption in hospitals 9. We assume that 70% of the facemask
storage in the whole of China would be supplied to the hospital system; thus, the baseline facemasks
availability (Fa(0)) was estimated to be 246,006,500, which is about 12 times of the usual daily
facemask productivity in China. In our model, we assumed all facemasks on the market and in storage
are available for consumption. In other words, we did not take into account factors that may limit the
supply on the market, such as logistics. We assumed that the daily facemask productivity (Fp(d))
changed during our prediction period due to the Chinese New Year holiday (24 Jan 2020 to 9 Feb
2020), the incentive to resume production, and new product lines. Specifically, we considered three
scenarios for the changes of daily facemask productivity, i.e., 1) 100% productivity (20 million per day)
before the Chinese New Year holiday, 40% to 60% productivity during the holiday, and 94% to 100%
productivity after the holiday; 2) 100% productivity before the Chinese New Year holiday, 40% to 60%
productivity during the holiday, and the productivity would increase from 94% after the holiday to 200%
on 3 Mar 2020; 3) 100% productivity before the Chinese New Year holiday, 40% to 60% productivity
during the holiday, and the productivity would increase from 94% to 400% on 3 Mar 2020 (See Table 1
for detailed description of each scenario). According to the MIIT and General Administration of
Customs, the daily number of facemasks imported to China were 6,000,000 between 24 Jan 2020 and
29 Jan 2020, 20,000,000 on 30 Jan 202013, 56,166,667 between 31 Jan 2020 and 11 Feb 202014. Given
a global facemask shortage has appeared in mid-February, we assumed a gradually decreasing daily
import of facemask between 12 Feb 2020 and 23 Mar 2020 from 50% to 10% of the import volume in
early-February and maintained a 10% of the import volume in early-February from 23 Mar 2020 to 30
Apr 2020. Based on the clinical experience of chief physicians in China, we assumed that each
healthcare worker would use five facemasks each day (α) at the usual time. And we assumed that each
person in the general population would use one facemask each day (β). We assumed the percentage of
the general population wearing facemasks (Pg(d)) to be close to 0% before the release of the national
technical protocol for SARS-CoV-2 (the first version) by the NHC (i.e., 0<d≤16) 2. The Pg(d) was
assumed to be 20% after the NHC recommended facemasks wearing in the national technical protocol
(the first version) (16<d≤23), and 60% after the release of the national technical protocol for
SARS-CoV-2 (the second version) and massive media cover (23<d≤25) 21. The Chinese government
suggested home quarantine for suspected cases and reducing gathering during the Chinese New Year
holiday; thus, we assumed the Pg(d) to be 20% from 24 Jan 2020 to 9 Feb 2020 (25<d≤41). Given that
most employees would return to work on 10 Feb 2020 while students would return to schools on 2 Mar

202022, we assumed the Pg(d) to be 40% from 10 Feb 2020 to 1 Mar 2020 (41<d≤61) and 60% from 1
Mar 2020 to 30 Apr 2020 (61<d≤121).
Results
Figure 1 shows the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of the COVID-19 and the public
health measures introduced by the Chinese government from 31 Dec 2019 to 15 Feb 2020, e.g.,
identification of pathogen, activation of different levels of emergency response, announcement of
protocols and guidelines for healthcare workers and the general population to follow, legislation
facemask wearing in public, and lockdown of about 13 cities in Hubei province. From municipal level,
provincial level, to national level, the Chinese government had implemented various strategies to
control and prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows our simulation of the facemask availability during the COVID-19 outbreak under
different scenarios of outbreak scale and facemask productivity. Specifically, Figure 2a shows the
facemask availability during the outbreak if the productivity only resumed to the usual level after the
Chinese New Year holiday. In this scenario, if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or
Hubei province (Scenarios a1 and a2), facemasks supplies in the whole of China could meet the need in
these regions. However, if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the whole of China (Scenario a3),
facemasks availability could only last for about 5 days (from 31 Dec 2019 to 5 Jan 2020). On 30 April,
there would be a shortage of approximate 853 million in the whole of China. Figures 2b and 2c show
the facemask availability during the outbreak if facemask productivity can gradually increase to 200%
and 400% of the usual level, respectively. As expected, if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in
Wuhan city or Hubei province (Scenarios b1, b2, c1, and c2), facemasks supplies in the whole of China
could meet the need in these regions. However, even with a productivity of 400% of the usual level,
facemask shortage could not be resolved by the end of April if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred in the
whole of China. We estimated that facemask productivity equals to 42.7 times the usual level is needed
to mitigate a shortage by the end of April.
Discussion
In this study, we summarized the public health measures introduced by the Chinese government during
the COVID-19 outbreak and simulated the facemask availability in three scenarios based on the scale
of the outbreak. Our results suggested that if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan (about
11.1 million population) or Hubei province (about 59.2 million population), a facemask shortage would
not happen in China. We also simulated the facemask availability in three scenarios regarding different
facemask productivity during the outbreak. Our analysis showed that if the outbreak occurs in the
whole of China, a shortage of facemask would appear in less than a week and could be substantial
under the existing public health measures. Only a dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times the
usual level) could mitigate the facemask shortage in time.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government introduced various measures, such as
lockdown of cities, shutdown of the transportation system, and legislation on mandatory facemasks
wearing in public 23. However, the implementation of these responses was not always timely, and the
virus eventually spread to the entire country. As soon as the general population began to realise the
severity of the outbreak, facemask consumption surged in only a few days, partly due to panic buying.
Although domestic productivity has resumed after the Chinese New Year holiday and global imports
have increased, facemask crisis was not resolved. Under these circumstances, many avoided leaving
their apartments and tried to extend the lifespan of each facemask by all means 24,25, school was closed,
online learning resources became widely available, and public facilities were mostly not opened. In this
way, the demand for facemasks in the general population is expected to decline and more resources
could be saved for healthcare workers 26.
Although our analysis was based on the COVID-19 outbreak in China, our findings could provide
insight into the public health measures in other areas of the world, considering the outbreak occurs in
city with a relatively high population mobility (e.g., London, New York, and Tokyo), and the virus
could spread to the province/state where this city is located and even the entire country quickly.
Therefore, governments across the world should revisit their emergency plan for controlling infectious
disease outbreaks in the local context. Timely public health measures should be taken to control the
outbreak within the city or the province/state where the city is located. Meanwhile, the supply of and
demand for facemasks and other medical resources should be considered when planning for public
health measures, so as to maintain the availability and affordability of medical resources. Besides,
timely and effective communication with the public is essential to mitigate panic buying and anxiety in
the population 27,28. Furthermore, during a medical resource crisis, health disparity could be widened
between specific population groups. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to find
themselves in a dilemma between the need to work in high-risk locations and the lack of protective
equipment. In addition, market forces can drive the price up, preventing them from purchasing an
adequate amount of protective equipment.
In order to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic, a global
collaboration to ease the medical resources crisis in the affected countries during an infectious disease
outbreak should be established. With the shared information, the collaboration could promptly evaluate
the severity of the outbreak and the availability of medical resources. Travel advice and guidance of
self-protection should also account for the potential medical resouce crisis in the epidemic areas.
Timely actions, such as increasing global productivity and distributing global storage, could be taken
with a joint effort to minimize the risk of shortage and control the outbreak.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask availability during the
COVID-19 outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the public health measures introduced by
the Chinese governments and considered three scenarios for the outbreak development. Nevertheless,
there are some limitations in this study. First, our estimation relied on the assumptions of facemask

productivity, import, storage, and need. Relevant information was limited at the time when the analyses
were performed (during the outbreak). Second, we did not take into account the logistics cost that could
restrict the supplies on the markets. Thus, our analysis is likely to underestimate the severity of the
facemask shortage experiencing by the healthcare workers and the general population. Third, we didn’t
consider the types of facemasks that should be used by individuals at different risk levels 29. The
situation of facemasks shortage might be more severe when considering the demand for different types
of facemasks from healthcare workers (most required KN95/N95 respirators and medical protective
masks) and the general population 29. Fourth, our prediction ended in late-April considering the
epidemic was predicted to fade out at about the same time 30. However, if the transmissibility of the
epidemic could be reduced, the peak and the end would be delayed 31, the daily incidence and the
demand for facemasks and other medical supplies would also decrease. Nevertheless, the anxiety in the
population may result in constant demand for facemasks even when the epidemic is under controlled.
Conclusion and policy implication
In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can
considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures
should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should
be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing
the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.

Number of facemasks available in the whole of China

Facemask storage was estimated to be seven times the daily consumption in hospitals . We assume

on 30 Dec 2010

that 70% of the facemask storage in the whole of China would be supplied to the hospital system;
thus, Fa(0) = 7×α×Nh.c / 70% = 172,204,550 / 70% =246,006,500
