Abstract (50 words)

8

We tested an operationally efficient way to pool samples on a rapid, point-of-care PCR device

9

and examined the limit of detection of SARS-CoV-2 for various pool sizes. Pooled testing

10

maintained testing performance similar to individual sample PCR testing, offering the potential

11

for scalable rapid testing at lower cost with less supplies.

Pooled Sample Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Using a Rapid RT-PCR COVID-19 Test (799

14

words)

15

Given the often asymptomatic presentation of COVID-19 and the potential for viral spread

16

before the onset of symptoms, reliable and repeatable testing is necessary to slow the pandemic.

17

New models of testing are required that can be self-administered, offer rapid results, and be

18

deployed in a variety of settings. Pooled sampling allows for cost-effective testing at improved

19

scale. Samples are combined and jointly tested with a single lab test. If the test is negative, all

20

samples are considered negative. If the test is positive, each sample may be tested individually to

21

determine which sample is positive.

22

Abdalhamid et al. found that for communities with a 5% prevalence rate, pooling five samples in

23

one test provided a 57% reduction in the total number of tests needed compared to individual

24

testing.(1) Lohse et al. found that up to 30 samples could be combined while preserving

25

diagnostic accuracy.(2)

26

Using pooled samples on a point-of-care device allows for the additional advantage of rapid

27

result turnaround and simplification of logistics, allowing for isolation decisions to be made in

28

real time. To advance this concept, we tested an operationally efficient way to pool samples on a

29

rapid-resulting PCR device and examined the limit of detection of SARS-CoV-2 for various pool

30

sizes on a point-of-care test.

31

The Study

32

Optum Labs, the research and development unit at UnitedHealth Group, performed this research

33

under an IRB approved protocol. We held testing events over the course of several weeks where

34

asymptomatic employees were tested. All participants validated they were not experiencing any

35

symptoms at the time of testing using both a daily symptom-checking application, ProtectWell,

36

plus a symptom check at time of testing.

37

We determined pool sizes based on the number of participants and the number of swabs each

38

participant provided, using a convenience sample approach. Participants provided 1–3 self-

39

collected anterior nares swabs, from both nostrils. For a given pool, each individual participant

40

swab was inserted in a single dilution buffer tube, provided with the test, for the pool and

41

agitated for a minimum of 10 seconds. Subsequent individual swabs were similarly exposed to

42

dilution buffer until the pool contained all samples. We used a portable, rapid RT-PCR device

43

(Visby Medical, San Jose, CA) to test all pools per manufacturer instructions.

44

A second swab collected at the same time was run individually for each participant on either

45

another Visby RT-PCR device or BioRad RT-PCR to ascertain the status of each member of the

46

pool. All participants were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

47

Using the remaining dilution solution from the pools, we calculated a target viral load of the

48

sample based on remaining volume and added various concentrations of positive control

49

(ZeptoMetrix NATSARS(COV2)-ERC1) to the dilution solution. Positive control was added to

50

the sample with a lab pipette to ensure accurate measurement, and a repeat pooled test was

51

performed with the original negative participants plus the viral control.

52

The portable RT-PCR device detected low levels of positive control in pools of up to 15

53

participants (Table 1). For pools larger than 15 participants, the device was less consistent unless

54

the viral copies/mL were increased. However, at these large pool sizes the device detected

55

presence of virus at 9,483 viral copies per milliliter—lower than the limit of detection for many

56

COVID-19 tests approved by the FDA , and in the performance range of some approved RT-

57

PCR methods.

58

We created one additional pool with a known positive participant’s sample combined with 14

59

other participants who were known negative. This pool was positive. The positive participant

60

was 12 days from exposure and substantially recovered from COVID-19. Interestingly, the

61

individual’s sample was read as negative on a BioRad PCR machine, which has a published limit

62

of detection of 10,000 viral copies/mL.

63

Conclusions

64

This study validates that pooled testing is a compelling way to increase testing capacity while

65

still using high performance testing technology. Further analysis is needed to clearly define the

66

limit of detection in pools greater than 15 participants.

67

This study had several limitations. Pool sizes were opportunistic rather than formulaic. In most

68

pools, positive control was added via a pipette to ensure exact measurements, but in a few

69

limited cases the amount of positive control was approximated.

70

While the dilution buffer can preserve a sample for approximately two hours before degrading,

71

in a few cases the sample may have been processed up to an hour after collection (most samples

72

were processed in 30 minutes or less). Our observations support that testing as soon as possible

73

after introduction into the dilution buffer increases the performance of the test, particularly in

74

detecting low viral loads in larger pools.

75

Despite these limitations, this work demonstrates the potential of pooled testing with pool sizes

76

of 15 more to improve operational efficiency while reducing cost and supplies and maintaining

77

testing performance similar to other PCR testing approaches.
