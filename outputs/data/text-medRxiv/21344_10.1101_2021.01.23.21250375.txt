Abstract
There is increasing evidence that adult patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 suffer from Long
COVID initially described in Italy.
To date, data on Long COVID in children are lacking.
We assessed persistent symptoms in pediatric patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19.
More than a half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19,
with 42.6% being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue,
muscle and joint pain, headache , insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly
frequent, as also described in adults.
The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term impact children as well, including those with
asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19, highlight the need for pediatricians, mental health
experts and policy makers of implementing measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on child’s
health.

Background
There is increasing evidence that adult patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 suffer from Long
COVID initially described in Italy (1). A recent large cohort of 1733 patients from Wuhan found
persistent symptoms in 76% of patients 6 months after initial diagnosis (2). To date, data on Long
COVID in children are lacking. We assessed persistent symptoms in pediatric patients previously
diagnosed with COVID-19.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included all children ≤18 year-old diagnosed with microbiologicallyconfirmed COVID-19 in Fondazione Policlinico Univeersitario A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy).
Patients > 18 years-old or with severe disability were excluded. Caregivers were interviewed about
their child’s health using a questionnaire (supplementary material) developed by the Long Covid
ISARIC study group (3), for evaluation of persisting symptoms. Participants were interviewed by
two pediatricians, either online or in the outpatient department, from September 1st to January 1st.
Participants were categorized into groups according to symptoms status during the acute phase
(symptomatic/asymptomatic), need for hospitalization

and time from COVID-19 diagnosis to

follow-up evaluation (<60, 60-120, > 120 days). Numerical variables were compared using t-test or
ANOVA, and categorical variables with χ2 or Fisher’s exact test where appropriate. All analyses
were performed using R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation). This study was approved by the Institutional
Ethics Committee and all participants consented to participate.

Results
129 children diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and November, 2020 were enrolled (mean
age of 11 ± 4.4 years, 62 (48.1%) female). Subsequently, three developed Multisystem
Inflammatory Syndrome (2.3%) and two myocarditis (1.6%). Patients were assessed on average
162.5 ± 113.7 days after COVID-19 microbiological diagnosis. 41.8% completely recovered, 35.7%
had 1 or 2 symptoms and 22.5% had 3 or more. 52.7% had at least one symptom 120 days or more
after diagnosis (Table 1).
Table 2 provides details about persistence of symptoms according to severity and length of followup. Insomnia (18.6%), respiratory symptoms (including pain and chest tightness) (14.7%), nasal
congestion (12.4%), fatigue (10.8%), muscle (10.1%) and joint pain (6.9%), and concentration
difficulties (10.1), were the most frequently reported symptoms. Although they were more common
in symptomatic or hospitalized children, they were also described in those individuals who were
asymptomatic during acute phase. 29 out of the 68 (42.6%) children assessed ≥120 days from
diagnosis were still distressed by these symptoms.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence of Long Covid in children. More than a
half reported at least one persisting symptom even after 120 days since COVID-19, with 42.6%
being impaired by these symptoms during daily activities. Symptoms like fatigue, muscle and joint
pain, headache , insomnia, respiratory problems and palpitations were particularly frequent, as also
described in adults (1, 2).
Limitations of the study include the single-center design with a relatively small sample size. All
patients were interviewed once, however this study is designed to continue periodic assessments
until 24 months after COVID-19 diagnosis and to include household members of different age
groups, with or without COVID-19 as a control group.
Children have been mostly overlooked during this pandemic, since the clinical course of COVID-19
in this group is much milder than in adults (4). However, there is an increasing evidence that
restrictive measures aimed at limiting the pandemic are having a significant impact on child’s
mental health (5). Childhood is a delicate and fundamental period of life, critical for acquisition of
social, behavioral and educational development. The evidence that COVID-19 can have long-term
impact children as well, including those with asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic COVID-19,
highlight the need for pediatricians, mental health experts and policy makers of implementing
measures to reduce impact of the pandemic on child’s health.
