Abstract
Background
Ethnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2
worldwide. The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the
pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger
family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We
studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand how COVID-19 had spread
within this community.

Methods
We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey specific to
three antigen targets. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised
questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence
stratified by age and gender. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated
with infection and antibody titres.

Findings
A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was
available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3%
(95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and
rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in
symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with
the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres.

Interpretation
In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date. In the context of this high force of
infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection. Actions to reduce the
burden of disease in this and other minority populations are urgently required.

Research In Context
Evidence before the study
In January 2020, we searched PubMed for articles on rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection
amongst ethnic minority groups and amongst the Jewish population. Search teams included
“COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, seroprevalence, “ethnic minority”, and “Jewish” with no
language restrictions. We also searched UK government documents on SARS-CoV-2
infection amongst minority groups. By January 2020, a large number of authors had reported
that ethnic minority groups experienced higher numbers of cases and increased
hospitalisations due to COVID-19. A small number of articles provided evidence that
strictly-Orthodox Jewish populations had experienced a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection
but extremely limited data was available on overall population level rates of infection
amongst specific ethnic minority population groups. There was also extremely limited data
on rates of infection amongst young children from ethnic minority groups.

Added value of the study
We report findings from a population representative, household survey of SARS-CoV-2
infection amongst a UK strictly Orthodox Jewish population. We demonstrate an extremely
high seroprevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 in this population which is more than five times the
estimated seroprevalence nationally and five times the estimated seroprevalence in London.
In addition the large number of children in our survey, reflective of the underlying population
structure, allows us to demonstrate that in this setting there is a significant burden of disease
in all age groups with secondary school aged children having an equivalent seroprevalence
to adults.

Implications of the available evidence
Our data provide clear evidence of the markedly disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 in
minority populations. In this setting infection occurs at high rates across all age groups
including pre-school, primary school and secondary school-age children. Contextually
appropriate measures to specifically reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst minority
populations are urgently required.

Introduction
The UK has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with 66,197 deaths involving
COVID-19 up to the 27th November 2020​1​. In the UK the pandemic has disproportionately
affected minority ethnic populations with relatively higher numbers of positive cases and
overrepresentation in admissions to hospitals and Intensive Care Units and deaths.​2–4​.
Similar disparities have been observed in other settings and amongst hospitalised patients,
mortality has been found to be higher in ethnic minority patients in both the UK and USA​5–7​.
The reasons for this disparity are unclear but are likely multifactorial, reflecting both higher
rates of infection resulting from socio-economic factors including deprivation, less ability to
work from home, higher use of public transport and larger household sizes, as well as
increased severity of illness due to higher rates of comorbidities or delayed access to care​8​.
Most population based studies in the UK have focused on the impact experienced by larger
minority ethnic groups and not on smaller groups, such as the Jewish community, despite
comprising approximately 265,000 individuals or 0.5% of the UK’s population​9​. In particular,
strictly Orthodox Jewish communities have anecdotally reported high rates of infection,
morbidity and hospitalisation during the first wave of the UK pandemic​10​. These anecdotal
reports are supported by findings from Public Health England (PHE) which suggests a higher
risk from infection in the UK Jewish population and higher rates of death due to COVID-19 in
those self identifying as Jewish with an age standardised mortality rates between March and
May for Jewish men over 65 years of 759 per 100,000 population, much higher than in other
religious groups​11​. This higher rate of infection amongst the Jewish community might reflect
socio-demographic differences compared to the general UK population. Strictly Orthodox
Jewish communities have among the highest total fertility rates in the UK, and experience
high rates of overcrowded homes and higher levels of socio-economic deprivation 12,13​
​
.
However, after adjusting for socio-economic factors the hazard ratio for death in Jewish men
remained double that of Christian men suggesting that routine socio-economic factors alone
do not explain all of the increased rate of infection seen in this community​11 . During the first
wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, strictly Orthodox Jewish communities also
reported higher incidence rates of COVID-19 than other socio-economically similar
communities​14,15​, or when compared to households in Arab communities with similar sizes
and levels of crowding​15​.
In Spring 2020, a UK tightly-knit strictly-Orthodox Jewish community became aware that they
appeared to be experiencing a high burden of SARS-CoV-2. In view of this, and national
data suggesting a high burden of infection in the Jewish community and a possible
disproportionately high burden in the strictly Orthodox community, we co-developed a
cross-sectional serological survey to measure the burden of infection and identify factors
associated with transmission and to inform local control efforts.

Methods
Recruitment and survey methodology
Within a strictly Orthodox Jewish community in the UK we conducted a household-focused
seroprevalence survey between late-October and early December 2020 prior to the third
national lockdown. We obtained a comprehensive list of all resident households within the
community, held by our community collaborators, and randomly selected households for the
study. A second list of households where laboratory confirmed infections were known to
have occured (the ‘enriched’ list) was also included to inform subsequent transmission
models. Members of the study team telephoned households to complete a standardised
questionnaire, including demographics, comorbidities, report of any previous presumed
COVID-19 illness, previous PCR or serological testing for SARS-CoV-2, access to care
whilst unwell with a COVID-19 like illness, illness severity, attendance at work, educational
or other community locations and travel overseas between February - November 2020. All
households were visited within 10 days of completing the questionnaire, all participants had
blood drawn for a serum sample except where a member of the household reported active
symptoms of COVID-19 in which case the visit was scheduled for a minimum of 14 days
after symptom onset. All members of the household were eligible to be included without age
restrictions.

Laboratory analysis
Serum samples were analysed for the presence of IgG specific for SARS CoV-2 trimeric
spike protein (S), Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens using a
multiplex chemiluminescence immunoassay (MSD, Rockville, MD) evaluated by our
laboratory as previously described 16,17​
​ .

Statistical analysis
Assuming 10% seroprevalence and a design effect of 2 we calculated we would need to
recruit 1,730 participants. Assuming an average household size of 6 we estimated this would
be approximately 300 households.
To obtain unbiased estimates, we restricted our analysis to individuals from randomly
selected households. Results related to the ‘enriched’ household dataset will be presented in
future analyses. We used cut-off values for the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay from previous
validation studies for antibodies against trimeric-spike, nucleocapsid and receptor binding
domain. For the purpose of this analysis, we considered a positive trimeric-spike response
as evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection as this target was shown to be the most
sensitive and specific target in assay validation​16​. As assay cut-offs are well defined in adults
but less well defined in children, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we considered
thresholds for the trimeric-spike assay of twice the previously defined limit.
We report the proportion of individuals who had a clinical illness consistent with COVID-19
and the proportion of individuals who had accessed testing prior to this survey. We

calculated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by age and gender and
adjusted for clustering at the household level. Age was classified as pre-school (0-4 years),
primary education (5-10 years), secondary education (11-18 years), adults and retirement
(greater than 67 years). We created a proxy variable which accounted for the number of
community events attended during the year (hereinafter ‘community-gatherings’) and a
variable reflecting household overcrowding based on the number of household residents and
the number of bedrooms​18​. To identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection we
fitted a multivariable random-effects logistic regression model adjusted for clustering at the
household level. We hypothesised that age, gender, being unable to work from home,
attendance at community events and household overcrowding were ​a priori likely to be
associated with an increased risk of infection. We assessed relationships between titres of
antibodies against each of SARS-CoV-2 spike, receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid in
relation to individuals age, gender, the presence or absence of a symptomatic illness, and
for symptomatic individuals the timing of their illness using a log-linear random effects
model.

Ethics
The study was approved by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Ethics
Committee (​Ref 22532)​ . Verbal informed consent was given during the telephone survey
and written consent provided prior to phlebotomy. Parents provided written consent for
children.

Results
Enrollment and demographics
A total of 903 randomly selected households were approached, of which 343 households
comprising 1,759 individuals were enrolled (Figure 1). An additional 70 households with
known cases of COVID-19 were provided by our community partners (referred to as
‘enriched households’) were approached to participate, of which 28 households comprising
183 individuals were enrolled (Supplementary Figure 3). Serum samples were collected
from 1242 individuals (70.6%) from 283 randomly selected households and 137 individuals
(74.9%) from 24 ‘enriched households.

Figure 1.​ ​CONSORT diagram for recruitment into the study​.

The median household size was 5 (IQR 3-7, Range 1-14 cf. UK median 2)​19 with a median of
3 bedrooms (IQR 2-5). The median age of survey participants was 14 years (IQR 7-33, cd.
UK median age 40 years) and 48.6% of participants were male (Supplementary Table 1). Of
individuals who gave a serum sample 48% were male and the median age was 16 years
(IQR 9-37).

Routine Testing for SARS-CoV-2
Amongst randomly selected households, a total of 446 individuals (25.4%) had undertaken
either PCR or serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 and 182 individuals (10.3%) reported a
positive result on at least one test. Reported reasons for testing were because of
symptomatic disease or stated as “for other reasons” (Table 1). Individuals who reported
testing were older (median 31 IQR 15-46 vs 12 IQR 5-25) and more likely to be male (52.7%
vs 47.1%).
Overall 228 individuals (13%) underwent either PCR and/or serological testing because of
symptomatic illness. A total of 191 symptomatic individuals reported providing a sample for
PCR with a swab positivity rate of 59% (n = 113). By comparison 20 of 181 PCR tests done
for other reasons were positive (11%). Overall 182 individuals (10.3%) reported already
having received a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the survey.

Serology on this cohort revealed an overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 of 64.3% (95%
CI 61.6-67.0%, 799/1,242). The seroprevalence varied by age between 27.6% (95%
confidence interval (CI) 20.8 - 35.6%) for children aged under 5 years of age to 73.8% (95%
CI 68.2 - 78.8%) amongst secondary school children and 74% (95% CI 70.0 -77.6%) adults
(Figure 2) (Supplementary Table 2). Seroprevalence was significantly higher amongst men
(68.8%, 95% CI 64.9 - 72.5%) than women (59.7%, 95% CI 55.8 - 63.5%) (​p = 0.001). Only
three individuals (2%) reported a previous positive PCR result but did not have detectable
anti-spike antibodies. All three individuals had a positive PCR in October and therefore a
negative serological test might reflect that they had not yet seroconverted at the time of
sample collection. In a multivariable random-effects logistic regression model, seropositivity
was associated with increasing age, male gender, household density and being unable to
work from home, but not associated with attendance at community gatherings (Table 2). No
pre-existing comorbidities were associated with seropositivity.

Overall, 697 (37.5%) individuals reported an illness they thought was consistent with
COVID-19. There were clear peaks in reported illness consistent with the first and second
waves of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (Figure 3). Of individuals reporting a suspected
illness 49.8% were male and the median age was 28 (IQR 14-41). A total of 16 (0.9%)
individuals reported hospitalisation for COVID-19 and a further three individuals were
reported to have died of COVID-19.

Figure 3. Self-reported COVID-19-like illness in participants in the study stratified by age and
antibody status. The reduced number of self-reported cases in November is an artefact reflecting the
timing of the survey. Missing Anti-Spike antibody status occured when participants did not participate
in phlebotomy after completing the survey. No phlebotomy samples gave an inconclusive result.

Overall 81.9 % of individuals who reported an illness consistent with COVID-19 were
sero-positive and 53.7% of asymptomatic individuals were sero-positive. Of cardinal
symptoms of COVID-19, self-reported cough (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 2.1-4.2), fever (OR 2.3, 95%
CI: 1.6 -3.4) and loss of smell or taste (OR 11.8, 95% CI: 6.8 -20.6) were all associated with
seropositivity. In the overall population self-reported loss of smell or taste had a positive
predictive value of 94.5% for positive serology (Supplementary Table 3).
Titres of spike, receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid antibodies were higher amongst
individuals who reported a symptomatic illness (Figure 4) (Table 3). Amongst symptomatic
individuals titres declined following time since reported symptomatic illness which was more
marked for nucleocapsid than for other targets (Supplementary Figure 1).

Discussion
We found an extremely high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a strictly
Orthodox Jewish community in the UK. Our estimate of 65% population seroprevalence is
markedly higher than recent estimates of 6.9% (95%CI 6.3-7.4%) nationally and 10.8% (95%
CI 9.3-12.5%) in London by random sampling in October by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS)​20​. Rapid declines in self-reported illness followed the introduction and adherence to
lockdown in March, demonstrating that even in this highly connected community such
measures are effective at reducing transmission. However over the course of 2020, the
overall seroprevalence in this tightly knit religious community reached levels similar to those
seen in Manaus, Brazil where a seroprevalence of more than 65% has been reported in
adults​21​. As our survey was completed by early December 2020, prior to the subsequent
winter case surge in London, it is likely that the overall burden of infection in this community
is now even higher.
Our estimates are amongst the highest sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 described
anywhere in the world to date. The precise reasons why the burden of SARS-CoV-2 has
been so high in this population are unclear. In Israel, Orthodox Jewish communities had
markedly higher SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab positive incidence rates compared to other
socio-economically similar communities during the first wave of the Israeli epidemic​14,15​. Data
from other sources suggest that lower socio-economic status, ongoing need to travel to work
and a greater burden of pre-existing comorbidities, may all contribute to increased risk of
acquiring SARS-CoV-2.
In our study population there was high seroprevalence in all age groups, with the highest
seroprevalence in working-age adults and older children where seroprevalence reached
74%. A strength of our study is the extremely high number of children recruited, which
reflects the high total fertility rates amongst strictly Orthodox Jewish women​12,13​.
Seroprevalence in the youngest children was lower at 27% but rose rapidly to more than
50% amongst primary school-aged children. The seroprevalence found in this group is
approximately four times that reported in a UK multicentre study on healthcare worker
children aged 2-15 years demonstrating the high rates of infection in all age groups in the
current study 22​
​ .
Seroprevalence was higher amongst men than women in our study. Higher SARS-CoV-2
attack rates in men compared to women have also been reported in other contexts​23​. The
higher rate of infection amongst men might reflect biological differences, differences in
comorbidities, differences in social mixing patterns or other behaviours. We did not find any
significant associations with reported attendance at community events, workplace or
household overcrowding in this population which may be because of a true absence of
effect, or that due to the extremely high seroprevalence, the ability to detect risk factors is
limited.
The majority of reported symptomatic illness occurred during the first and second waves of
the COVID-19 pandemic mirroring case reporting patterns seen across London and the UK.
Just over 10% of participants reported at least one swab test due to symptomatic illness

since March, with an overall swab positivity rate of 59%. In line with other studies, children
were significantly less likely to report a symptomatic illness​24,25​.
We found that antibody titres against spike and nucleocapsid proteins declined at different
rates, and in line with other studies​16,26​, that anti-nucleocapsid declined more quickly. If we
had used only anti-nucleocapsid antibodies as a marker of previous infection our estimated
seroprevalence would have been 42.8%, significantly under-estimating the likely size of the
epidemic that has occurred in this population. Declines in anti-spike antibody titre were less
marked over time but it is still possible that we have under-estimated the true
seroprevalence in this population. Titres of both spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were
higher amongst individuals who reported symptomatic illness.
Our study has a number of limitations. We recruited 38% of households that were
approached and obtained serum samples from 70% of study participants. This enrollment
rate is similar to other national COVID-19 household surveillance studies, such as the ONS
COVD-19 Infection survey​27​, suggesting it is unlikely to be a major source of bias. Individuals
who gave serum samples were slightly older than those from whom serum was unavailable
which may result in an over-estimation of the overall population seroprevalence. We relied
on self-report of presumed COVID-19 illness which may be unreliable. However the timings
of self reported illness match well to national surveillance data and self-reported illness was
strongly associated with the presence of anti-spike antibodies suggesting that in this
population this was a reliable metric.
Although our study was conducted in a strictly Orthodox Jewish community, these
communities share many characteristics with other ethnic and religious minority groups
including larger family sizes, increased population density, children attending select schools,
regular attendance at communal events and gatherings, and English as a second language.
As such our findings are likely relevant to other tightly-knit ethnic and religious minority
groups in the UK and elsewhere. Our work, conducted in direct collaboration with the
community, should be a model for understanding risk in minority populations where there are
no similar published data currently.
In conclusion, we found evidence for an extremely high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this
specific community affecting individuals of all ages. This provides further evidence that
minority communities in the UK and elsewhere are disproportionately affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for this remain unclear, although are likely to be a
complex interplay of socio-economic and behavioural factors. Further studies to better
understand drivers of transmission in ethnic and religious minority populations, conducted
wherever possible in partnership with communities themselves, are urgently needed to
reduce health disparities and improve outcomes for these populations.
