Abstract

19

For African countries currently reporting COVID-19 cases, we estimate when they will report

20

more than 1 000 and 10 000 cases. Assuming current trends, more than 80% are likely to exceed

21

1 000 cases by the end of April 2020, with most exceeding 10 000 a few weeks later.

22

Main Text

23

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of

24

international concern (1) and then a pandemic (2), citing its rapid global spread and risk of

25

overwhelming healthcare services with patients requiring critical care. As of 24 March 2020,

26

WHO situation reports (SITREPs), indicated 45 African countries reported at least one

27

laboratory-confirmed infection (“reported case”) of COVID--19 (World Health Organization

28

2020). Reported cases underestimate actual infections due to the mix of mild symptoms (3, 4),

29

the similarity of symptoms common to the region (5), and weak surveillance (6). However,

30

assuming constant reporting activity, reported cases grow in proportion to the underlying

31

epidemic, and even with under-ascertainment of the number of actual cases, reported cases

32

provide a useful indicator of stress on healthcare systems. We can use this surrogate for the real

33

epidemic to forecast future trends, and understand the consequences of a slow public health

34

response and what preparations need to be made now.

The Study

36

We use a branching process model to project the number of future cases of COVID-19 in each

37

country. This model assumes each case produces a number of new cases (distributed

38

~NegBinom

2,  0.58) (7, 8) which occur after some delay (distributed

39

~LogNormal E 4.7, SD 2.9 (9). We start with cases corresponding to the first 25

40

(or fewer) reported cases in the WHO SITREPs up to 23 March 2020 (10). Using those epidemic

41

parameters and initial cases and dates, we simulate the accumulation of the reported cases. We

42

assume there are always sufficient unreported infections to continue transmission, and that new

43

cases represent a reporting sample from both identified and unidentified transmission chains. As

44

long as a constant reporting fraction persists during this period, and unreported spread is large

45

relative to reported cases (or reporting has negligible impact on control), this is a reasonable

46

approximation.

47

For each set of country-specific initial conditions, we generate n=10 000 epidemics, discarding

48

any that fade out, consistent with our assumption of unreported transmission chains. We identify

49

the dates when each simulation run crosses 1 000 and 10 000 reported cases, and then evaluate

50

the 50% and 95% quantiles of those dates to determine the forecast interval. The model was built

51

in the R statistical programming language, using the bpmodels package (11), and the

52

data2019nCoV package for the SITREP data (12). All analysis code is available from

53

54

We project that almost all African countries are likely to pass 1 000 reported cases by the end of

55

April 2020 and 10 000 within another few weeks (Figure 1 and Table 1); alarmingly, these are

56

largely synchronized continent- wide and real disease burden will certainly exceed reported

57

cases. Since our projections assume failed containment of initial cases and no interventions

58

reducing early transmission, they are pessimistic relative to any benefits of local action.

59

However, containment measures, e.g. travel restrictions, increased testing, contact tracing,

60

isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts, are likely to slow, but not halt, real epidemic

61

growth (13). Indeed, increased testing may accelerate the time to reporting these numbers, as

62

improved ascertainment increases the identified fraction of real cases. However, the model also

63

optimistically assumes surveillance capacity is not overwhelmed or stymied, which would slow

64

reaching 1 000 reported cases while the real disease burden grows uncontrolled. Because we

65

ignore these effects, the model is only appropriate for short-range forecasts.

66

As model validation, we applied this same forecasting approach to countries world-wide that

67

have now exceeded 1 000 reported cases; we did not consider those with more than 10 000 cases,

68

as they have all undergone substantial control measures modifying epidemic growth. We found

69

that 44% of actual reporting dates fell within the 50% prediction intervals, and 79% within the

70

95% interval (Figure 2), indicating the forecast prediction interval is too certain, as expected for

71

a rapid but low detail model. We further showed that forecast performance is not a random

72

outcome by performing a randomization test: we shuffle the assignment of forecast days-to-1

73

000-cases to different countries, and score 1 000 shuffled predictions; the real forecast score is

74

significantly different from random at the p < 0.001 level (Figure 2 inset).

75

Specific to Africa, the forecast for South Africa fell within the 50% prediction interval (SITREP

76

69; 29 March 2020). From 23 March 2020, we projected a few other countries would also likely

77

be crossing this threshold soon: Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia. As of SITREP 75

78

(4 April 2020), the first three are still fast approaching this limit, while fast and intense responses

79

in the latter two may have successfully slowed the epidemic.

80

Conclusions

81

Using reporting to date, and assuming similar epidemiological trends to those seen globally, we

82

project that almost all African countries are likely to exceed 1 000 reported cases by the end of

83

April 2020, and 10 000 within another few weeks. This timing is largely synchronized continent-

84

wide and real disease burden will certainly exceed reported cases. Our projections assume no

85

substantive changes between the initially reported cases and the forecast points; while some

86

countries have taken drastic actions, many have not or have acted slowly. As seen in other

87

regions, because onset of severe symptoms can be delayed weeks from infection and last several

88

weeks, interventions have limited immediate impact on new hospitalizations or facility demand,

89

meaning that most of the countries in our projection would be well past 1 000 cases by the time

90

the effects of interventions started today would be observed.

These results call for accelerated preparations across Africa to ready healthcare systems and

92

citizens for the incoming wave of COVID-19 infections. Augmented staffing, personal protective

93

equipment stores and training, general isolation beds and equipped critical care units are all

94

urgently needed. Citizen awareness will also be critical, and officials should encourage

95

preventive measures such as physical distancing and regular hand washing.
