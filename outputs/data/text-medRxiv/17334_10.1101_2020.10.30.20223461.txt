ABSTRACT
Importance: COVID-19 case fatality and hospitalization rates, calculated using the number of
confirmed cases of COVID-19, have been described widely in the literature. However, the
number of infections confirmed by testing underestimates the total infections as it is biased based
on the availability of testing and because asymptomatic individuals may remain untested. The
infection fatality rate (IFR) and infection hospitalization rate (IHR), calculated using the
estimated total infections based on a representative sample of a population, is a better metric to
assess the actual toll of the disease.
Objective: To determine the IHR and IFR for COVID-19 using the statewide SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence estimates for the non-congregate population in Connecticut.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Setting: Adults residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1,
2020.
Participants: Individuals aged 18 years or above.
Exposure: Estimated number of adults with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Main Outcome and Measures: COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among adults
residing in a non-congregate setting in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020.
Results: Of the 2.8 million individuals residing in the non-congregate settings in Connecticut
through June 2020, 113,515 (90% CI 56,758–170,273) individuals had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
There were a total of 9425 COVID-19-related hospitalizations and 4071 COVID-19-related
deaths in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020, of which 7792 hospitalizations and
1079 deaths occurred among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 IHR and
IFR was 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%–13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%–1.90%) among the non-

congregate population. Older individuals, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals and those
belonging to New Haven and Litchfield counties had a higher burden of hospitalization and
deaths, compared with younger individuals, women, non-Hispanic White or Hispanic
individuals, and those belonging to New London county, respectively.
Conclusion and Relevance: Using representative seroprevalence estimates, the overall COVID19 IHR and IFR were estimated to be 6.86% and 0.95% among the non-congregate population in
Connecticut. Accurate estimation of IHR and IFR among community residents is important to
guide public health strategies during an infectious disease outbreak.

BACKGROUND
Accurate estimation of the hospitalization and fatality rate is important to guide public
health strategies during infectious disease outbreaks. Although the case fatality rate (CFR),
defined as the proportion of deaths of the confirmed cases, is a commonly used metric, it will be
biased based on the availability of testing, especially early in the outbreak.1 Moreover, since
COVID-19 symptoms range widely, mild or asymptomatic infections may be untested. Thus, the
number of infections confirmed by testing will underestimate the total infections, inflating the
estimated fatality rate.
A better estimate of the actual toll is the infection fatality rate (IFR), defined as the
proportion of deaths of the total infected individuals, in which the denominator is ideally based
on a representative sample of a population. For hospitalizations, the infection hospitalization rate
(IHR) is a comparable measure. Accordingly, using results of the recently conducted statewide
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study—the Post-Infection Prevalence study (PIP)—in
Connecticut,2 we assessed the SARS-CoV-2 IHR and IFR.

METHODS
Based on the PIP study,2 the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.0% (90%
CI 2.0%–6.0%) among a representative population of adults residing in non-congregate settings
in Connecticut before June 2020. We used this estimate to calculate the overall population
estimates for individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 using the 2018 American Community
Survey. We also estimated the number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and region.

Information on the total COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths among the noncongregate population in Connecticut, between March 1 and June 1, 2020, was provided by the
Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut Department of Public Health,
respectively. The diagnostic codes used to identify COVID-19-related hospitalizations are listed
in eTable 1. Total COVID-19 deaths included both confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths
(details in eMethods).
IHR and IFR were defined as the number of individuals who were hospitalized and died,
respectively, due to COVID-19 divided by the total estimated number of individuals who had
COVID-19 using the seroprevalence estimates. The margin of error for our estimates were
calculated at the 90% confidence level in accordance with the design of the PIP study, however,
estimates at 95% CI have also been provided. Due to sample size limitations, the upper end of
the confidence interval was non-estimable (NE) when stratifying by some of the
sociodemographic characteristics. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.2.

RESULTS
Of the 2.8 million individuals residing in the non-congregate settings in Connecticut,
113,515 (90% CI 56,758–170,273) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (eTable 2). Between March 1
and June 1, 2020, there were a total of 9425 COVID-19-related hospitalizations and 4071
COVID-19-related deaths in Connecticut, of which 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths
occurred among the non-congregate population.
The overall COVID-19 IHR and IFR was 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%–13.72%) and 0.95%
(90% CI, 0.63%–1.90%) among the non-congregate population (Table 1). When compared with
women, men had a higher IHR (12.21% [90% CI, 6.23%–NE] vs 4.64% [90% CI, 3.00%–

10.25%]) and IFR (2.39% [90% CI, 1.22%–59.71%] vs 0.34% [90% CI, 0.22%–0.75%]). By
age, IHR and IFR ranged from 0.80% (90% CI, 0.36%–NE) and 0.01% (90% CI, 0.01%–NE)
among individuals aged 18–29 years, to 12.43% (90% CI, 6.46%–NE) and 1.30% (90% CI,
0.68%–16.94%) among those aged 55-64 years. By race/ethnicity, IHR and IFR were
significantly higher among Black individuals (9.90% [90% CI, 5.32%–70.40%] and 1.46% [90%
CI, 0.78%–10.35%]), as compared with White (7.42% [90% CI, 4.56%–20.05%] and 1.12%
[90% CI, 0.68%–3.01%]) and Hispanic (1.04% [90% CI, 0.78%–1.57%] and 0.23% [90% CI,
0.17%–0.35%]) individuals. New Haven and Litchfield counties had the highest IHR (9.04%
[90% CI, 4.65%–NE]) and IFR (1.65% [90% CI, 0.55%–NE]), respectively, whereas New
London county had the lowest IHR (4.04% [90% CI, 1.37%–NE]) and IFR (0.57% [90% CI,
0.19%–NE]). IHR and IFR estimates with 95% CI are presented in eTable 3. The confirmed and
probable IFRs are shown separately in eTable 4.

DISCUSSION
Using seroprevalence estimates, we found that, through June 2020, Connecticut's
COVID-19 IHR and IFR were 6.86% and 0.95%, respectively. The rates of hospitalization and
death varied and older individuals, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals, and those belonging to
New Haven and Litchfield counties had the highest burden of adverse outcomes. Our estimates
are distinctive because they reflect people living in the community and are based on a
methodology that sought to obtain a representative estimate for the denominator.
There has been continued controversy about the IFR and the literature is replete with
widely varied estimates.3-7 A recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 IFR, estimated a global pooled
COVID-19 IFR of 0.68%,5 with values ranging from 0.01% to 1.60%. However, the studies

included did not have a representative sample or separate out special populations, such as those
in nursing homes. Moreover, IFR is not an inherent characteristic of the disease, but rather a
confluence of the pathogen virulence, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the
population, health care availability and quality, therapeutic availability, and accurate counting
and reporting of COVID-19-related deaths. As such, an overall IFR may not be very informative
given the heterogeneity among subgroups.
The COVID-19 IHR is not well described and most studies report the CHR, which also
varies widely in the literature.8-10 The CDC estimated a US COVID-19 CHR of 14.0% for
infections before June 2020.10 As expected, this CHR estimate was higher than Connecticut’s
estimated IHR in our study (6.9%), as IHR includes the total estimated infections rather than
detected positive cases only. Moreover, our estimate excluded individuals from congregate
settings, which had a higher burden of adverse outcomes.
Our subgroup findings are notable. Although it has been noted that age and sex are
associated with disease severity, prior studies have been hampered by including nursing home
residents and biased by testing patterns. We had the opportunity to identify hospitalizations and
deaths among the non-congregate population in Connecticut and show that, even in the
community, these associations remain. Of note, Black individuals had a higher IFR and IHR than
White individuals, though the difference was not statistically significant. Prior studies have
shown that Black individuals have had disproportionately higher infection rates, even as some
studies indicate that hospital mortality does not vary by race/ethnicity.11 Our findings highlight
that the burden of COVID-19 among Black subpopulations is not just about infection rates but
also worse outcomes. The IHR for Hispanic individuals was lower than for White and Black
individuals, which was in accordance with previously reported low hospital admission rates

among Hispanic individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Baltimore-Washington, DC12
and may be associated with the lower insurance rates among the Hispanic subpopulation in
Connecticut.13
Our study has some limitations. First, total COVID-19-related hospitalizations could have
been underestimated due to limited testing availability, underestimating the IHR estimate.
Second, although antibodies are specific indicators of past SARS-CoV-2 infection, their
concentration may decrease few months after exposure14 and there are differences in the
sensitivity of available assays.15 Hence, the total infections may be biased lower, overestimating
our estimates. Nevertheless, representative seroprevalence studies provide important information
regarding infections in a community and can provide robust estimates of the IHR and IFR, when
combined with hospitalization and death data.
In conclusion, using representative seroprevalence estimates, we estimate an IHR and
IFR of 6.86% (90% CI 4.58%–13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI 0.63%–1.90%), respectively, for
COVID-19 infections through June 1, 2020, among the non-congregate population in
Connecticut.
