Abstract

The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing in the
Philippines. Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this
study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care
facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected
COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure
time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and
availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care
workers. Based on the simulation results, a set of risk assessment criteria is proposed to classify
risks as ‘low’, ‘moderate’, or ‘high’. We recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient
encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker
and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe
space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement
compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g.,
95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the
formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in
public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.

Introduction
NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.
As of March 20, 2020, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has infected 250,704 worldwide,
resulting in 10,256 deaths, with Italy surpassing China in the reported number of deaths on the
same day [1,2]. Aggressive suppression strategies have been recommended [3], and countries

across the world have implemented strategies to mitigate the damage caused by this pandemic
[4].

Health care workers work in the frontlines across the world unceasingly, running the greatest risk
of getting infected and infecting others in their immediate environment – in the hospital, at home
– or wherever they go. In the Philippine context, health care system can be described as a twotiered [5]. There is a huge disparity in the capacity between the public and private health sectors
[5]. As of 2016, there are a total of 101,688 hospital beds, with a ratio of 23 beds for 10,000 people
in the National Capital Region, and more than half (53.4%) of these are in private hospitals [5].
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals is continuously increasing
exponentially [6]. Therefore, given that the health system is likely to be overwhelmed [5,7], these
frontline health care workers (frontliners) are faced with unimaginable risks of getting infected.

Every doctor, nurse, medical technologist, radiation technologist, nursing assistant, hospital
janitor and security guard will inevitably face the risk of COVID-19 infection. Here, we formulate
a mathematical model to investigate how many frontliners are expected to be infected under
certain scenarios [8]. We use this expected number of possible new infections as a measure of
the risk. A set of risk assessment criteria has been formulated based on the theoretical results to
determine if a frontliner has low, moderate or high risk of COVID-19 infection.

Mathematical models can be used for predicting scenarios and in prescribing solutions to
problems [8,9,10,11], such as addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the simulations and
risk assessment, several recommendations are suggested to inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV-2,
especially in health care facilities.

Results and Discussion

The formulated risk model (see Appendix: Methods) aims to examine the risk factors of virus
transmission per day, quantify these risks, estimate the number of new infections, and suggest
ways to minimize these risks. There are several factors that determine the risk of infection:
•

Average number of COVID-19 patients (or, in other settings, number of susceptible
persons) entering a given location at a given time, whether they are confirmed to be
positive or not;

•

Average number of encounters with a patient (or, in other settings, any susceptible person)
at a given time, whether COVID-19 infected or not, where an encounter is defined to be
less than or equal to 30 seconds;

•

Duration of interaction of each of these encounters;

•

Work shift duration of each frontliner (or, in other settings, can be equivalent to the
exposure time for any person in public transportation, offices, classrooms, and mass
gatherings);

•

Crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location,
the presence of compartments or dividers in a room, and how frequent cleaning is done
in the environment as the density of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles present on surfaces limits
the safe space available; and

•

Level of protection present (e.g., isolation booths, N95 masks, face and eye shields)
including level of protection to reduce exposure to aerosolized particles (e.g., for those
tasked to do intubation either via direct or via video laryngoscopy, to do nasopharyngeal
or oropharyngeal swabs).

In the following discussion, the parameters will be discussed in terms of the frontliner setting, but
the parameters can likewise be applied in other settings, such as in crowded places, classrooms,
offices, public vehicles, and markets.

Average Number of Encounters and Work Shift Duration (Exposure Time)

The average number of encounters per hour can be defined as the average number of patients a
frontliner has interacted in an hour given that an interaction is less than or equal to 30 seconds.
We can convert number of patients per minute to number of encounters using the following
formula:
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑝𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟 ≈
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟
×

𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠
.
0.5 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠

For example, a 10-15 minute interview with a patient is equivalent to 20-30 encounters. A doctor
doing brief rounds on 10 patients (where each patient is looked upon in at most 30 seconds) or
the situation of having 5 patients per minute are equivalent to 10 encounters.

According to our simulation results, the expected number of infected frontliners increases as the
average number of encounters between the frontliner and COVID-19 patients increases as well
as when work shift duration or exposure time increases (Figure 1A & 1B). If there is highly
interacting population (e.g., the average number of encounters per hour is 120, which means that
the frontliners and the patients are interacting every 30 seconds) or a series of long interactions
(e.g., 4 patient interviews per hour where each interview takes 15 minutes), then there is a high
chance that one person will be infected. If there is low interaction rate (e.g., seeing one patient
only for less than or equal to 30 seconds once per hour), then the chance of getting infected is
low but the risk is not zero.

It should be noted that if the number of possible infected frontliners is greater than or equal to one,
then there is high risk of infection; if the number of possible infected frontliners is less than one

but not equal to zero, then there is still some level of risk (low or moderate risk of infection). In a
7-hour work shift duration, there is high chance a frontliner will be infected if the interaction rate
is around 12 encounters per hour (Figure 1B). This can be imagined as a triage nurse seeing 1
patient for at most 30 seconds every 5 minutes during the duration of his or her 7-hour work shift.

The number of newly infected frontliners is directly proportional to the average number of
encounters per hour (Table 1). Regardless of work shift duration, a hospital security guard or a
triage nurse entertaining 120 persons per hour (1 patient every 30 seconds) is at least 12 times
more likely to get infected than a medical or radiation technologist encountering 10 patients per
hour. A doctor conducting long duration interviews and examinations on patients (20-80 persons
per hour) is 2 to 8 times more likely to get infected than for example, a radiation technologist.

Regardless of the type of frontliner, a work shift duration of at least 10 hours is at least 1.25 times
more likely to be infected than that of 8 hours. The longer the work shift duration or exposure time,
the higher the infection risk (Table 2).

Crowd Density

We define crowd density as the number of people in a room divided by the maximum capacity of
the room. We can also define it as the average proportion of COVID-19 infected entities present
within a 2-meter radius (minimum radius for social distancing) from the health care worker. The
entity may be an infected patient (confirmed or not confirmed), or any object or surface in the
immediate environment that contains SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. There is evidence that the virus
particles stay as long as 3 hours as aerosols and 72 hours on plastic surfaces [12].

Looking at the following figure (Figure 2), crowd density acts as a fraction that modifies the risk of
getting infected at all levels of encounter rates, from the laboratory (low encounter rate per hour)
to the triage area (high encounter rate per hour). A crowded place where social distancing is not
highly implemented can initiate transmission of the disease. Having more space available for each
patient, putting dividers between infected patients, and cleaning the workspaces more often lead
to a lower crowd density. A lower crowd density implies that the frontliner is receiving a lesser
fraction of the risk of infection. A higher crowd density increases the chance of being infected.

Initial Number of Infected Patients

The effect of crowd density is so important that, even if ten COVID-19 infected patients enter the
same room at the same time, the risk of the frontliner getting infected can be dramatically reduced
by reducing the crowd density (Figure 3). For example, a health care worker in a room with crowd
density of 10% is at least 95% less likely to be infected than a health care worker in a room with
crowd density of 100%. Moreover, as expected, the number of newly infected patients in a room
is directly proportional to the infection risk faced by the frontliners (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Risk of infection determined by the number of infected cases present in a room with the
frontliners. Parameters used: Smax=100, no protection, average number of encounters per hour =
120, work shift duration or exposure time = 1 hour.

Protection Level

Protection level is defined as the fraction of the risk being removed or mitigated by measures
done by the health care worker or any other person. It has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum
value of 1. It can be observed in Figure 4 that a 95% or better protection level significantly reduces
infection risk. We can assign values which may be additive as shown in Table 3.

Regardless of the number of COVID-19 patients entering a given location at the same time,
regardless of the average number of encounters per hour, and regardless of the work shift
duration or exposure time, the protection level removes a substantial fraction of the risk faced by
the health care worker (Figure 4). In general, having PPEs confers protection towards the health
care worker, but certain procedures, especially doing an endotracheal intubation for critically-ill
COVID-19 patients, exposes the health care worker to aerosolized particles.

However, the number of COVID-19 patients entering at the same time at a given place influences
the level of protection needed (Figure 5). For even an hour of exposure, when ten COVID-19
patients enter at the same time in the same place, the risk of getting infected with 70% level of
protection is the same as the risk of getting infected when there is no PPE worn in a room with at
most three COVID-19 patients.

Risk Assessment

From the previous tables and figures, we therefore propose an overall risk score to be used by
each frontliner (Tables 4 and 5). We define the overall risk score as a function of the expected

number of new infected persons. If the overall risk score is less than 1.0, then there is a low risk
that a person will become infected. An increase in the risk score is proportional to the increase in
the number of persons expected to be infected. For example, an overall risk score of 2.00 implies
that there are two expected new infected persons. The maximum overall risk score is 10 (where
𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 10 , 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 10 , 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑑 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 1 , and 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙 = 0 ).
The proposed formula is defined as:
𝑂𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
(𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 + 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 )
× 𝐶𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑑 𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦

× (1 − 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙).
=

Analogous to the “low” and “high” risk assessments for health care providers of the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) [13], we likewise propose a categorization
of “low risk” and “high risk”. If the overall risk score is greater than or equal to 1.0, then there is a
high risk of a person getting infected.
We can also add an intermediate category between “low” and “high” risks. A “moderate” risk
category may be defined as those overall risk scores between 0.5 and 1. By doing a Monte Carlo
sensitivity analysis (5 million simulation runs), assuming each input has 10% error, the overall risk
score has 0.45 standard error. To account for this uncertainty, overall risk scores between 0.5
and 1 can be classified under the qualitative category of Moderate Risk.

The overall risk score can be used to compare practices. Moreover, as the number of days the
health care worker is doing his or her regular job related to a COVID-19 task, the risk of infection
increases. The number of days can be scaled accordingly as exposure time.

From the simulations, we have proposed risk assessment criteria and several recommendations.
Through these, governments and organizations can have insights on how to minimize or eliminate
the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially in health care facilities. It is important to protect our
health care workers as they are considered essential part of the health care capacity that can
provide optimal care to the patients. To test the utility of our model, the model has been used in
the Job Risk Profiling Calculator (https://datastudio.google.com/s/iCAEymT7alg) that is used by
private and public institutions in the Philippines.

All in all, based on the simulations, the following recommendations can be made:
•

Decreasing the rate of patient encounters per frontliner, such as having multiple frontline
triage nurses, multiple queues, multiple entrances, and proper referral systems, mitigates
the risk of infection. Crowd density factor should always be considered. Having many
COVID-19 patients in a room can render a protective measure relatively inadequate. It is
recommended to have a quota on the number of COVID-19 patient encounters per
duration of work shift. Telemedicine or online consultations can also be an effective control
in reducing high risk frontliner-patient interaction [14,15].

•

Shorter work shift duration or exposure time reduces the risk faced by the frontliners,
especially the security guard and the triage nurse. The protection level against SARSCoV-2 transmission must be increased accordingly if shortening of work shift duration is
not feasible.

•

Increased spacing, frequent cleaning of work spaces, and compartmentalizing the rooms
of patients in open space decrease the risk of infection not only for health care workers
but for the other patients who are COVID-19 negative or non-person-under-investigation
(PUI) [16].

•

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) plays a vital role in decreasing the risk of infection,
but this protective factor can be overwhelmed by the sheer number of COVID-19 patients
(whether confirmed or not). Hence, this should not be relied upon alone, and other
structural factors, such as crowd density, be adjusted.

•

Frontliners who are handling risky procedures such as endotracheal intubation (i.e.,
anesthesiologists) on critically-ill COVID-19 patients (who are most likely to be the most
infectious), must be given extra protection, and hospital policies must minimize their
duration of exposure and the number of patients they encounter or interact with per shift.

•

Health care workers play a very important role in a community’s battle against the medical
effects of COVID-19. Decreasing the infection risks faced by each health care worker per
day, coupled with superior health, well-being and welfare practices, will result in a robust
health care staff that can endure a long period of battle during this COVID-19 pandemic.

•

Decreasing the infection risk discussed in this paper can also be extended to decreasing
the infection risk of non-COVID-19 patients present in a hospital. Moreover, the model and
results presented here can be customized for other similar scenarios, such as identifying
infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass
gatherings.

•

The recommendations in this paper is based on a theoretical model with parameters
calibrated for COVID-19. The theoretical model and algorithm in this paper can be
modified for other diseases. It is suggested to validate the results through experiments or
cohort and case control studies.

Conclusion

In this study, we formulated a mathematical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health
care facilities. We considered the following factors: (1) the average number of encounters with a
suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; (2) interaction time for each encounter; (3) work shift
duration or exposure time; (4) crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available
in a given location; and (5) availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided
for the frontline health care workers. A set of risk assessment criteria has been proposed based
on the theoretical results to determine if a frontliner is facing low, moderate or high risk of infection.

Based on the simulations and risk assessment, several recommendations are suggested, namely
(1) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three
encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (2) decrease the interaction time between
the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (3)
increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density,
and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (4) provide effective protective
gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their
shift.

Appendix: Methods

The estimated values for the number of possible newly infected patients are generated using the
Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) Method of integration to solve the system of differential equations. We use
the software (Berkeley Madonna for Mac ver.9.1.19). The differential equations are based on an
S-E-I compartment model of disease transmission.

The model is described by the following system of differential equations:

where S, E, I are the number of susceptible, exposed, and infected persons (in this case,
frontliners); F is the force of infection; 𝛼 is the rate of an exposed individual becoming not infected
(e.g., through handwashing or other protective measures); and 1 − 𝛼 is the rate of getting infected.

The force of infection F is defined as:
𝐹 = 𝜆 ∙ 𝐼0
where 𝜆 is the effective transmission rate, and 𝐼0 is the initial number of infected persons (or “the
inoculum”), where the effective transmission rate 𝜆 is defined as:
𝜆 = 𝑝∙𝛽
where 𝛽 is the transmission risk or probability, and p is the total contact rate. We cannot express
p as I/N, which is the ratio of the total number of infected persons to the total population in a given
area because it assumes that everyone is homogenously distributed in a given place. Instead, we
note that p is in terms of the fraction of the initial number of susceptibles (𝑆0 ) over the maximum
number of susceptibles that a given area can accommodate (𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 ), multiplied by the encounter
𝜇

ratio (𝜃 ), where 𝜇 is the average number of encounters per hour and 𝜃 is the threshold number of
𝜇

encounters per hour. Suppose 𝜃 = 𝑁 per hour. If 𝜃 < 1 then we are sure that the frontliner has
not yet encountered everyone in the room; if

𝜇
𝜃

= 1 then there is a possibility that the frontliner

already encountered everyone in the room; if

𝜇
𝜃

> 1 then we are sure that the frontliner

encountered a person in the room more than once (by Pigeonhole Principle). The ratio 𝑆

𝑆0

𝑚𝑎𝑥

can

also be interpreted as the crowd density. The case where 𝑆0 = 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝜇 = 𝜃 characterizes the
usual well-mixed S-E-I model. The parameter 𝛽 (e.g., 𝛽 = 0.2 [10]) is assumed to be a function of
the COVID-19 basic reproductive number (e.g., R0 = 3) divided by the infectious period (e.g., 𝜏 =
14). We can also interpret

𝜇
𝜃

> 1 as increasing the average nature of the reproductive number.

The goal of the study is to investigate the risk of individuals during one cycle of day job. The
simulations should end before 48 hours since the dynamics may already change as the newly
infected person also becomes infectious.

The exposed (E) class here, in contrast to the classical SEIR model, does not represent persons
at the latency stage of the disease. Simply, E class here includes people who have been exposed
with the virus (e.g., from respiratory droplets) but the persons can be unexposed through
protections (e.g., through washing hands and wearing of face masks). Incubation period is not
included because the goal of the study is only for short duration (less than 48 hours). The I
compartment is only for counting how many new individuals have been infected, and is not
intended to reflect feedback loop leading to a community outbreak. The paper is for risk
assessment and not intended to simulate epidemics in the whole community.

The following is the Berkeley Madonna code:
