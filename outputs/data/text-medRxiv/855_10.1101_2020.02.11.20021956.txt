Abstract

2

Background: The emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has pushed several

3

countries into state of emergency all over the world. The possible transmission of

4

2019-nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health

5

implications.

6

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible

7

transmission of 2019-nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67

8

cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during

9

17–28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time

10

RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019-nCoV.

11

Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory-confirmed NCP and the remaining

12

four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded

13

positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results.

14

None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with

15

conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test.

16

Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative.

17

Conclusion: 2019-nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP.

18

Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not

19

supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission

20

path.

Introduction

24

The current outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in

25

Wuhan, China has posed a threat to global public health and has been defined as a

26

Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health

27

Organization (WHO)1. Thus far, tens of thousands of confirmed cases, including

28

healthcare workers, have been identified in China, with the latest mortality rate

29

calculated at approximately 2.52%2. Generally, patients infected with 2019-nCoV

30

develop respiratory illness, with the first symptoms of fever, cough and fatigue that

31

quickly progress to pneumonia3. A number of patients were observed with

32

extra-pulmonary manifestations at the onset of the illness, such as conjunctivitis, or

33

even presented with asymptomatic infection4,5. Additionally, the susceptible and

34

potential routes of viral spread from patients or asymptomatic carriers to healthy

35

person have yet to be fully understood6. These issues pose great challenges for disease

36

diagnosis and outbreak control, and make the goal of improving our understanding

37

one of the upmost urgencies.

38

2019-nCoV has been identified as one of a class of single-stranded enveloped

39

RNA viruses, belonging to the beta-coronaviruses genus of the Coronaviridae family

40

that has been isolated from several mammals, including humans7. Although the

41

genome sequence of 2019-nCoV is distinct from severe acute respiratory syndrome

42

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

43

(MERS-CoV), they all have the potential to cause a severe acute respiratory disease

44

and possess human-to-human transmissibility8. Similar to SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV

45

gains entry into host cells through recognizing and binding to its potential host

46

receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is distributed among

47

various tissue and cell types, including the conjunctiva9-11. A previous study indicates

48

that healthcare workers suffer from higher risk of SARS infection in the case of

49

unprotected eye contact with secretions12. The SARS-CoV has been shown to spread

50

through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes13,14. Moreover,

51

there are increasing reports suggesting that a few novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)

52

cases began with conjunctivitis as the initial symptom following contact with

53

confirmed patients without protective goggles4,15,16. For these reasons, determining

54

whether 2019-nCoV is capable of transmission through aerosol contact with

55

conjunctiva is an important consideration that warrants for further exploration.

56

In view of the limited understanding and controversy surrounding knowledge of

57

viral transmission through the conjunctival sac, we performed a retrospective cohort

58

study designed to seek ophthalmologic evidence for the transmission of 2019-nCoV

59

from patients via aerosol contact with the conjunctiva. The findings of this study may

60

provide novel insights into spread routes and potential infection control measures for

61

2019-nCoV that may help battle this outbreak.

62

Methods

63

Case enrollment

64

From 17 Jan to 28 Jan 2020, we enrolled 67 patients with either confirmed or

65

suspected cases of NCP in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

66

Laboratory-confirmed cases were identified with the criteria of at least one positive

67

result from a respiratory specimen using viral isolation, next-generation sequencing,

68

or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Suspected cases

69

were recruited based on the criteria of fever or signs/symptoms of lower respiratory

70

illness (e.g. cough or shortness of breath), low or normal white-cell count or low

71

lymphocyte count, and no reduction in symptoms after antimicrobial treatment for 3

72

days. The history of epidemiologic exposure was also considered and incorporated17.

73

All patients invited to participate in the study provided consent for the

74

nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. The study was approved by the

75

Ethics Committees of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

76

Study design

77

Patient clinical details, including general information, clinical manifestations,

78

and extra ocular symptoms, were obtained through review of health records or the

79

implementation of questionnaire-styled interviews. General information was

80

documented, including age, gender, underlying chronic conditions, date of symptom

81

onset, date of hospital and ICU admission, and previous history of contact with

82

confirmed patients or potential exposure to 2019-nCoV. The clinical manifestations

83

included fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc. Additionally, any ocular

84

symptoms at the very onset, such as conjunctivitis or other ophthalmic manifestations,

85

were solicited from all participants.

86

We took nasopharyngeal swabs and conjunctival swabs from all patients during

87

hospitalization. Further laboratory methods were performed on these swab samples

88

for the detection of 2019-nCoV utilizing real-time RT-PCR assays. The experimental

89

protocols are as follows: RNA extraction from conjunctival swabs and

90

nasopharyngeal swabs was performed in preparation for subsequent one-step reverse

91

transcription–coupled PCR reaction using a proprietary master mix containing a DNA

92

binding dye and thermal cycler. The primers and probes for 2019-nCoV detection

93

were selected according to the National Pathogen Resource Center (National Institute

94

for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC), and the sequences were as

95

follows: forward primer 5 -CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA-3 ; reverse primer

96

5 -ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA-3 ;

97

5’-FAM-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3’. The conditions for

98

the amplifications were 50°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of

99

95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s 18.

Results

101

Samples were collected from 67 patients initially suspected to have NCP over a

102

period of 11 days (17–28 Jan 2020), of whom, 25 were male and 42 were female

103

(Table 1). The mean age was 35.7 (SD 10.6) years (range 22–78 years). The majority

104

were healthcare workers and female nurses. By Jan 28, 2020, 63 patients were

105

identified as laboratory-confirmed NCP and the other four were suspected NCP. Of

106

the four suspected NCP cases, there were two males and two females. Conjunctival

107

swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results, and swabs from

108

two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients

109

had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first

110

symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. Conjunctival swabs samples

111

from the four suspected NCP cases were negative. The history of one positive case，

112

two probable positive cases, and one case with the first symptom of the eye were as

113

follows:

114

Patient No. 8 was a male, 58 years old, and an emergency vehicle driver for the

115

pre-hospital emergency team. He was admitted to the hospital because of fever and

116

cough. The chest CT examination showed viral pneumonia. Both the nasopharyngeal

117

and conjunctival swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. There has been no

118

ocular discomfort. He had a history of unprotected contact with isolated patients.

119

Patient No. 24 was a male, 78 years old, and had a history of lung cancer with

120

brain metastasis, chronic obstructive pneumonia, and hypertension. He was admitted

121

to hospital for coughing, expectoration, and gasping. The results of 2019-nCoV RNA

122

testing revealed that the nasopharyngeal swab was positive and the conjunctival swab

123

was suspicious positive. There was no ocular discomfort. He had a history of contact

124

with an NCP recessive carrier. The recessive carrier was also diagnosed with NCP and

125

was hospitalized.

126

Patient No. 30 was a female, 29 years old, and pregnant at 36 weeks. She was a

127

physician. She was admitted to the hospital because of fever. The results of the

128

2019-nCoV RNA test revealed that the nasopharyngeal swab was positive and the

129

conjunctival swab was suspicious positive. She had no ocular complaint. She had a

130

history of contact with a confirmed NCP patient.

131

Patient No. 41 was a female, 48 years old, and an anesthesiologist. She was

132

admitted to hospital with fever, cough, redness of eyes, itching, and secretion. The

133

results of 2019-nCoV RNA testing revealed that the nasopharyngeal swab was

134

positive but the conjunctival swab was negative. The anesthesiologist presented with

135

conjunctivitis as the initial symptom. The ocular symptoms were mild. The discomfort

136

of the eye was relieved by itself without medication. She had a history of contact with

137

a confirmed NCP patient wearing a surgical mask but no protective goggles.

138

Discussion

139

Of the cases enrolled in this study, one was positive for the conjunctival sac

140

2019-nCoV test and two cases were suspicious positive. None of these three patients

141

had ocular symptoms. One anesthesiologist presented with conjunctivitis as the first

142

symptom but had a negative conjunctival sac 2019-nCoV test. There have been some

143

reports regarding conjunctival sac and coronavirus, and coronavirus has been isolated

144

from 7-month-old children with conjunctivitis and bronchitis19. Moreover, SARS

145

coronavirus was detected in the tears of SARS patients, although the detection rate of

146

coronavirus in the conjunctival sac was low20. The results of this study revealed that

147

the incidence of conjunctivitis in patients with NCP is not high. At present, this kind

148

of conjunctivitis has no specific manifestation, and can present in one eye or two eyes.

149

In the early stage, it appears as common conjunctival hyperemia with fewer secretions.

150

It is watery and akin to thin mucus. Occasionally small pieces of conjunctival

151

hemorrhage are seen. The ocular symptoms of the patients were mild and tended to be

152

self-healing. There was great variation between the patients.

153

Our confirmed patient No. 41 was an anesthesiologist. She developed ocular

154

symptoms after performing intubation anesthesia for a patient, followed by fever and

155

cough. The patient was diagnosed with NCP, however during the anesthesia, the

156

anesthesiologist wore only an ordinary surgical mask, hats, and gloves, and did not

157

wear goggles, protective clothing, or other protective devices. Two surgeons (patient

158

No. 10 and patient No. 40) who operated on the NCP patient were later diagnosed

159

with NCP. The two surgeons had no ocular discomfort. General anesthesia involves

160

tracheal intubation and may increase the risk of viral infection. Our confirmed patient

161

No. 30 is a physician. She and her three colleagues (patient No. 28, patient No. 46,

162

and patient No. 65) were all infected from the same patient. The conjunctival swab

163

tests for the six infected doctors (patient No. 41, patient No. 10, patient No. 40,

164

patient No. 28, patient No. 46, and patient No. 65) were all negative, which did not

165

support the spread of the virus through temporary aerosol contact with the

166

conjunctiva.

167

This is a retrospective study of a small sample size, in which there is only one

168

time point. Negative results from conjunctival sac swabs could be influenced by the

169

sampling amount and time, as viral conjunctivitis is self-healing. There was a certain

170

false negative rate in the viral RNA test, and with this knowledge, we will continue to

171

pay close attention to the progress of the patients. Additionally, we should determine

172

whether 2019-nCoV is also present in convalescent patients as well as the infectivity

173

of the conjunctiva.

174

Our clinical observation and analysis can serve as a reminder that all medical

175

workers, not only ophthalmologists, must make solid efforts for protection when

176

treating patients. Specifically, doctors must wear masks, goggles, protective clothing,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956; this version posted February 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

177

and gloves. Following contact with patients, close attention must be paid to hand

178

disinfection as well as the disinfection of relevant inspection instruments and the

179

clinical environment. The above measures can serve to cut off transmission channels

180

and prevent cross infection in support of public health and safety.

181

In conclusion, 2019-nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients

182

with NCP. Through our clinical analysis, the concept that the virus is transmitted

183

through the conjunctival route it is not supported. The prevention of and treatment for

184

new coronavirus infectious disease requires greater attention and activity. The

185

possibility of eye infection and the ocular route as a potential infection source should

186

be considered and further examined, and scientific protection should be carried out.
