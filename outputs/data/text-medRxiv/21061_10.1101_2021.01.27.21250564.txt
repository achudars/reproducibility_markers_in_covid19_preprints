Abstract
In the fight against COVID-19, there remains unmet needs in developing point-of-care (POC)
diagnostic testing tools that can rapidly and sensitively detect the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus to
control disease transmission and improve patient management. Although recent CRISPR-Casassisted SARS-CoV-2 detection assays (such as DETECTR and SHERLOCK) are viewed as
transformative solutions for POC diagnostic testing, their lack of simple sample processing and
full integration within an automated and portable device hamper their potential for POC use. We
report herein POC-CRISPR – a new single-step CRISPR-Cas-assisted assay that is coupled to
droplet magnetofluidics (DM) – that leverages simple magnetic concentration and transport of
nucleic acid-binding magnetic beads to accomplish sample preparation and assay automation. By
further adapting the assay into a fully integrated thermoplastic cartridge within a palm-sized
mobile device, POC-CRISPR was able to detect 1 genome equivalent (GE)/µL SARS-CoV-2 RNA
from a sample volume of 100 µL in 30 min. Moreover, when evaluated with unprocessed clinical
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab eluates, POC-CRISPR identified SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in as
short as 20 min and achieved full concordance with standard RT-qPCR.

Introduction
Since its initial report in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across 220
countries and territories across the globe[1]. As of December 15, 2020, there are more than 71
million confirmed cases and more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide.[1] In the fight against this
once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, diagnostic testing that can rapidly and sensitively detect the causative
virus SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care (POC) is identified by the WHO as a top priority[2] due to
the potential for controlling disease transmission and improving patient management. Responding
with unprecedented urgency, the global scientific community has made remarkable progress in
developing promising tools toward POC diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2. This is especially true
in the commercial sector, where Abbott’s ID NOW COVID-19 test, which can report results in 5
– 15 min, and Cepheid’s Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, which can report results in 45 min, represent
the leading commercial instruments in POC diagnostic testing. Despite these promising
developments and several evaluation studies,[3-8] however, there has yet to see wide adoption of
these devices or POC diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2 in general. Such a gap signals that there
remains a significant room for new solutions.
CRISPR-Cas-assisted diagnostic assays (e.g., SHERLOCK[9] and DETECTR[10]) have in
recent years captured significant attention.[11-14] Aided by the elegant detection mechanism, these
assays have demonstrated fast detection while obviating instrument-intensive thermocycling. As a
result, CRISPR-Cas-assisted SARS-CoV-2 detection assays[15-20] are viewed as transformative
solutions for POC diagnostic testing. Developing a POC diagnostic test from this nascent method,
however, still must address numerous technical requirements. For example, to ensure ease of use,
portability, and resource/infrastructure independence, CRISPR-Cas-assisted assays still must
reduce assay steps, obviate manual operation in sample processing, and integrate with automated
and portable devices. To this end, despite their seminal status, both DETECTR-based[15] and
SHERLOCK-based SARS-CoV-2 detection[16] require multiple manual assay steps and input
SARS-CoV-2 RNA that is already extracted and purified by benchtop instruments. More recent
assays[21-26] have made significant advances but have yet to fully meet these requirements. For
example, AIOD-CRISPR[21] (a novel one-step CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted transcription recombinase
polymerase amplification[27] (RT-RPA) assay) and the amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a
assay[25] can be detected via a miniaturized detector or a mobile phone, but both still require
benchtop-extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA as the input and separate heating modules for incubation.
STOPCovid.v2,[22] a new SHERLOCK assay that couples one-step CRISPR-Cas12b-assisted
reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification[28] (RT-LAMP) to benchtop
magnetic-based RNA extraction, represents perhaps the most mature CRISPR-Cas-assisted assay
to date, but still relies on manual operation to process samples. Thus, to date, there had yet to be a
CRISPR-Cas-assisted SARS-CoV-2 detection assay that is tenable for POC use.
In response, we have developed POC-CRISPR – the first one-step CRISPR-Cas-assisted
assay that is fully integrated with sample preparation and implemented in a POC-amenable device.
Sample preparation in POC-CRISPR is achieved through droplet magnetofluidics (DM),[29-35]
which uses magnetic-based capture and transport of nucleic acid-binding magnetic beads to
automate complex sample preparation procedures. DM-enabled sample preparation offers an
effective means for concentrating and purifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a large volume of swab
eluate, as well as for transporting the RNA to downstream amplification and detection. Moreover,
we have established a DM-compatible, one-step, fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted
RT-RPA assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. To facilitate POC use, we have implemented POC-

CRISPR within a plastic assay cartridge that is comparable to a USB stick in size and a lateral flow
strip in material cost, and we have developed an automated, palm-sized, mobile device for
performing the assay. POC-CRISPR could detect 1 genome equivalent (GE)/µL SARS-CoV-2
RNA from a sample volume of 100 µL in 30 min. Moreover, when evaluated with 8 unprocessed
NP swab eluates, POC-CRISPR could identify the 4 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in 20 – 40
min and achieved full concordance with standard benchtop RT-qPCR.
Results
Overview of POC-CRISPR
POC-CRISPR detects SARS-CoV-2 virus directly from unprocessed clinical NP swab
eluates in a sample-to-result workflow powered by the integrated mobile DM device (Figure 1A).
POC-CRISPR begins by injecting the swab eluate and a magnetic bead buffer into an assay
cartridge and mounting the cartridge in the mobile DM device. This process takes < 1 min handson time and represents the only manual process in POC-CRISPR. Within the mobile DM device,
a motorized magnetic arm, a miniature heating module, and a compact fluorescence detector are
programmed by a microcontroller to execute sample preparation, reaction incubation, and
fluorescence measurements in full automation. Briefly, the motorized magnetic arm first
concentrates the magnetic beads that capture SARS-CoV-2 RNA from the swab eluate and then
sequentially transports the concentrated beads and bound RNA to the wash buffer well and the
CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA reaction mixture well. Upon the arrival of RNA, the heating
module heats the reaction mixture well to initiate the reaction while the fluorescence detector
periodically measures the fluorescence emitted from the reaction. The resulting real-time
fluorescence curves signal the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the NP swab eluate.
DM-enabled sample preparation and CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA represent the two
crucial assay components in POC-CRISPR. In this work, DM-enabled sample preparation from
clinical NP swab eluates is facilitated by pH-mediated electrostatic attraction between RNA and
functionalized magnetic beads. Briefly, the swab eluate is first exposed to a low-pH binding buffer
supplemented with a detergent, in which the viral particles are lysed and negatively-charged RNA
can electrostatically bind to magnetic beads with positive surface charges. As the magnetic beads
can be concentrated, they offer an effective strategy for concentrating RNA from large volumes of
swab eluates and boosting the assay sensitivity. When the magnetic beads and bound RNA are
magnetically transported out of the swab eluate, potential inhibitors to CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted
RT-RPA are left behind. Moreover, as the magnetic beads and bound RNA are magnetically
transported into a neutral-pH wash buffer, RNA remains bound to the magnetic beads while
additional potential inhibitors adsorbed to the magnetic beads are released into the wash buffer,
thereby achieving further purification. As a result of DM-enabled sample preparation, concentrated
and purified RNA can be delivered to the CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA reaction mixture
(Figure 1B). In this work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected via a fluorescence-based, one-step
CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA reaction. Within this reaction, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is in vitro
transcribed and amplified via RT-RPA into DNA amplicons, which activate Cas12a-guide RNA
complexes to cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fluorogenic reporters, thereby producing
fluorescent signals for detection (Figure 1C).

Figure 1. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab eluates via POC-CRISPR empowered by
integrated droplet magnetofluidics. (A) POC-CRISPR – the first CRISPR-Cas-assisted assay integrated with sample
preparation and implemented in a POC-amenable device – can detect SARS-CoV-2 directly from unprocessed
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab eluates in a sample-to-result workflow. Upon injecting the NP swab eluate into an assay
cartridge and mounting the cartridge into a palm-sized, mobile digital magnetofluidic (DM) device, the device
performs sample preparation, reaction incubation, and fluorescence measurements in full automation. The resulting
real-time fluorescence curves signal the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the NP swab eluate. (B) Within
the device, sample preparation is powered by DM, which leverages magnetic-based capture and transport of nucleic
acid-binding magnetic beads to concentrate and purify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a large volume of NP swab eluate
and to transport the RNA into a CRISPR-Cas-assisted reaction mixture. (C) The reaction mixture incorporates reverse
transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and Cas12a-based collateral cleavage of singlestranded DNA fluorogenic reporter in one pot. Within the reaction, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is in vitro transcribed and
amplified via RT-RPA into DNA amplicons, which activate Cas12a-guide RNA complexes to cleave single-stranded
DNA fluorogenic reporters, thereby producing fluorescent signals for detection.

Development of benchtop DM-compatible CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA
As a prerequisite for realizing POC-CRISPR, we first developed a DM-compatible
CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA on benchtop. That is, the CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA
can successfully amplify and detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA that is captured and concentrated by
magnetic beads. As the testbed, we employed standardized synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA from
NIAID BEI Resources (NR-52358) as the target. Consistent with our previous DM devices,[33-34]
we employed ChargeSwitch magnetic beads and the associated binding buffer as our magnetic
bead buffer. For SARS-CoV-2 amplification and detection, we used a fluorescence-based
CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA adopted and modified from AIOD-CRISPR[21] and our recently
developed deCOViD[23] that used a more sensitive, Alexa647 fluorophore-based ssDNA

fluorogenic reporter[36] (Supplementary Information Table S1). For developing this new assay, we
mixed SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the magnetic bead buffer and used a benchtop magnetic rack to
capture and wash the magnetic beads and bound RNA. We next added the CRISPR-Cas12aassisted RT-RPA reaction mixture and used a benchtop real-time PCR instrument to incubate the
reaction and measure the fluorescence. We finally analyzed the real-time fluorescence
amplification curves from the reactions to assess the reaction conditions. We note that, aside from
differences in assay components and conditions, our benchtop DM-compatible CRISPR-Casassisted SARS-CoV-2 detection assay shares a comparable workflow as STOPCovid.v2[22].
We investigated a range of parameters in our benchtop DM-compatible CRISPR-Cas12aassisted RT-RPA assay to improve its performance in SARS-CoV-2 detection. In these
investigations, we used 100 µL of 100 GE/µL RNA as the sample – up to 100-fold greater in
sample volume than typical CRISPR-Cas-assisted assays in which ~1 – 5 µL samples are spiked
directly into the reaction mixtures – because magnetic beads could capture and concentrate RNA
from such a large sample volume. We established our first version of DM-compatible CRISPRCas12a-assisted RT-RPA by incorporating WarmStart RTx reverse transcriptase in the assay,
which could be achieved without requiring a designated step for removing the magnetic beads
from the reaction mixture (Supplementary Information Figure S1). We then determined that, while
multiple reverse transcriptases supported DM-compatible CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA,
WarmStart RTx reverse transcriptase allowed the fastest and most efficient detection among the
reverse transcriptases we tested (Supplementary Information Figure S2). As WarmStart RTx
reverse transcriptase reacts optimally at 55 °C, we next tuned the reaction temperature and found
that our RT-RPA was the most efficient at 43 °C and 45 °C (Supplementary Information Figure
S3). Finally, we adjusted the concentrations of WarmStart RTx reverse transcriptase, Cas12a,
Cas12a-guide RNAs, and ssDNA fluorogenic reporter, and selected 1.50 U/μL WarmStart RTx
reverse transcriptase (Supplementary Information Figure S4), 0.32 μM Cas12a in combination
with 0.16 μM each of Cas12a-guide RNAs (Supplementary Information Figure S5), and 4 µM
ssDNA fluorogenic reporter (Supplementary Information Figure S6) for our assay. Upon tuning
these reaction conditions, our benchtop DM-compatible CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA could
detect 100 µL of 100 GE/µL SARS-CoV-2 RNA, yielding real-time fluorescence amplification
curves with onsets of fluorescence increase at ~20 min and strong fluorescence signals after 60
min (Supplementary Information Figure S5 and Figure S6).
Rapid and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection in POC-CRISPR
The development of the benchtop DM-compatible CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA
assay allowed us to realize POC-CRISPR with ease, as the assay could be seamlessly adapted in
the thermoplastic cartridge and automated by the mobile device. Notably, as the cartridges are
fabricated from inexpensive plastic, the material cost for each cartridge is only $0.3
(Supplementary Information Table S2). Upon injecting the mixture of sample and magnetic bead
binding buffer in the sample well of the cartridge and mounting the cartridge in the device, the
device transported the magnetic beads and bound RNA to the prefilled wash buffer well and then
to the prefilled CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA reaction mixture well (Figure 2A(i)), and
finally commenced reaction incubation and fluorescence measurements. Due to potential
differences between the benchtop PCR instrument and the miniature heating module in our mobile
DM device, we tuned the reaction temperature and set it at 45.5 °C (Supplementary Information
Figure S7). Operating at this reaction temperature, POC-CRISPR could clearly detect 100 µL of

100 GE/µL RNA, as the amplification curves showed onsets of fluorescence increase at ~15 min
and steady increases thereafter until 60 min, which were distinct from the slightly decreasing
curves in control reactions with no RNA template (Figure 2A(ii)). POC-CRISPR could also detect
100 µL of 1 GE/µL RNA, which represents a low viral RNA concentration (Figure 2A(iii)).
Notably, the amplification curves from 1 GE/µL RNA became distinguishable from the slightly
decreasing curves from no RNA controls after only ~30 min, suggesting the possibility of
shortening the turnaround time of POC-CRISPR. To our knowledge, these results also represent
the first real-time monitoring of a CRISPR-Cas-assisted SARS-CoV-2 detection assay within a
POC-amenable device.
To demonstrate the benefit of sample concentration in POC-CRISPR, we performed
comparison experiments in which we directly amplified and detected the sample in the cartridge.
Here, we spiked 1 µL SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly into the CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA
reaction mixture well of the cartridge (Figure 2B(i)). Under direct amplification, samples
containing 100 GE/µL RNA were still clearly detected (Figure 2B(ii)), though the amplification
curves showed slightly slower onsets of fluorescence increase at ~20 min and slightly lower
fluorescence signals than those from samples that had been magnetically concentrated. On the
other hand, samples containing 1 GE/µL RNA yielded amplification curves that slightly decreased
during incubation and appeared similar to control reactions with no RNA template (Figure 2B(iii))
– noticeably worse than the robust amplification curves from 1 GE/µL RNA samples that had been
concentrated. These results illustrate that sample concentration in POC-CRISPR can help detect
low concentrations of RNA, which would improve analytical sensitivity and potentially reduce
false negatives and enhance clinical sensitivity.

concentration of RNA from a large sample volume (e.g., 100 µL) and subsequent automated transfer of magnetic
beads and bead-bound RNA to the washer buffer and the reaction mixture within the cartridge enable sensitive
detection of SARS-CoV-2. Using POC-CRISPR, (ii) 100 GE/µL RNA samples (blue) can be clearly differentiated
from the no RNA controls (gray) and (iii) 1 GE/µL RNA samples (blue) can also be distinguished from the no RNA
controls (gray). (B)(i) In contrast, under the more standard “direct sample amplification” scheme, only a small sample
volume (e.g., 1 µL) can be added into the reaction mixture, which can lead to poorer detection sensitivity. (ii) Directly
amplified 100 GE/µL RNA samples (blue) can still be clearly differentiated from the no RNA controls (gray), but (iii)
directly amplified 1 GE/µL RNA samples (blue) become barely distinguishable from the no RNA controls (gray).

Evaluation of POC-CRISPR in clinical sample testing
Finally, we evaluated the performance of POC-CRISPR in detecting SARS-CoV-2 directly
from clinical NP swab eluates without prior sample processing. We tested 8 samples and compared
the results with standard RT-qPCR (with CDC-approved primers and probe[37]) performed in a
benchtop thermocycler. Here, even for testing these clinical samples, POC-CRISPR allowed us to
simply load the mixture of each swab eluate (10 µL) and our magnetic bead buffer into the
cartridge, mount the cartridge in the mobile DM device, and initiate testing. POC-CRISPR
identified 4 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples that yielded robust fluorescence amplification curves
(Figure 3A, samples 1 – 4). Notably, the amplification curves for samples 1 and 2 saw onsets of
fluorescence increase in 20 min and both saturated the fluorescence detector in the mobile DM
device. The 4 samples were also tested as positive by benchtop RT-qPCR, whose cycle of
quantification (Cq) values ranged from 22.5 to 26.3. POC-CRISPR also identified 4 SARS-CoV2 negative samples that yielded slightly decreasing fluorescence signals (Figure 3A, samples 5 –
8). These 4 samples were also tested as negative by benchtop RT-qPCR. Moreover, the slightly
decreasing fluorescence signals from these 4 negative samples appeared similar to those from the
no target control reactions in blank viral transport media (Figure 3A, NTC 1 and 2). Overall, POCCRISPR achieved 8 out of 8 concordance with benchtop RT-qPCR (Figure 3B). Importantly, we
note that because POC-CRISPR performs real-time fluorescence detection, it has the capacity to
report positive results as soon their amplification curves showed onsets of fluorescence increase
that allow differentiation from NTCs, thereby shortening the turnaround time. In the case of the 4
positive samples, POC-CRISPR could report these results in 20 – 40 min. Although these 4
positive samples have high viral loads, they nevertheless provide a glimpse for the potential of
POC-CRISPR toward rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.

Figure 3. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from unprocessed clinical nasopharyngeal swab eluates via POC-CRISPR.
8 clinical nasopharyngeal swab eluates are tested by POC-CRISPR without prior sample processing steps, as well as
by gold-standard RT-qPCR that uses the CDC-approved primers and probe and is performed in a benchtop
thermocycler. (A) POC-CRISPR identifies 4 positive samples that yield robust fluorescence amplification curves
(samples 1 – 4), which are tested as positive by benchtop RT-qPCR with cycle of quantification (Cq) values ranging
from 22.5 to 26.3. Notably, samples 1 and 2 yield fluorescence signals that saturate the detector in the mobile DM
device. POC-CRISPR also identifies 4 negative samples that yield slightly decreasing fluorescence signals (samples
5 – 8) similar to those from the no target control reactions in blank viral transport media (NTC 1 and 2). These 4
samples are also tested as negative by benchtop RT-qPCR. (B) Overall, POC-CRISPR achieves 8 out 8 concordance
with benchtop RT-qPCR.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed POC-CRISPR, the first CRISPR-Cas-assisted assay that
is tenable for POC use. For developing POC-CRISPR, we first developed an integrated benchtop
assay by successfully coupling CRISPR-Cas12a-assisted RT-RPA with DM-enabled sample
preparation and tuning various assay components (e.g., reverse transcriptase) and reaction
conditions (e.g., reaction temperature). We subsequently actualized POC-CRISPR by adapting the
newly integrated benchtop assay within our custom inexpensive thermoplastic assay cartridge and
our palm-sized, integrated mobile DM device, which executed the assay in full automation. We
demonstrated that POC-CRISPR is capable of sensitive and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
– 1 GE/µL from a sample volume of 100 µL in 30 min – which ranks among the most sensitive
and fastest CRISPR-Cas-assisted SARS-CoV-2 detection to date. We also evaluated the
performance of POC-CRISPR in testing 8 unprocessed clinical NP swab eluates. POC-CRISPR
could identify the 4 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in 20 – 40 min and achieved full concordance
with gold-standard benchtop RT-qPCR.
We foresee building upon our promising initial results and taking several routes for
improving and expanding POC-CRISPR. First, we foresee improving the analytical sensitivity of

POC-CRISPR toward testing clinical samples with low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. This can be
achieved by fine-tuning our magnetic bead buffer so that the input volume of NP swab eluate can
be further increased. Second, although POC-CRISPR already involves only a simple manual
operation with < 1 min hands-on time, we still envision improving the user-friendliness of POCCRISPR, which could be accomplished by new cartridge designs that simplify sample injection
and reagent prefilling. Third, upon the development of a more sensitive and simpler POC-CRISPR,
we can revisit clinical sample testing and focus on samples with low viral loads. Finally, as both
DM-enabled sample preparation and CRISPR-Cas-assisted assay can be readily designed for other
DNA or RNA targets, we foresee applying POC-CRISPR toward other diseases. Taken together,
POC-CRISPR not only represents a significant advance for CRISPR-Cas-assisted diagnostic
assays but also has strong potential to become a useful diagnostic tool for COVID-19 and other
diseases at the point of care.
