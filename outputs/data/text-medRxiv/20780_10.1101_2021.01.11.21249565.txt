Abstract
Background: Compartmental models help making public health decisions. They were used during the
COVID-19 outbreak to estimate the reproduction numbers and predict the number of hospital beds required.
This study examined the ability of closely related compartmental models to reflect equivalent epidemic
dynamics.
Methods: The study considered three independently designed compartmental models that described the
COVID-19 outbreak in France. Model compartments and parameters were expressed in a common framework
and models were calibrated using the same hospitalization data from two official public databases. The
calibration procedure was repeated over three different periods to compare model abilities to: i) fit over the
whole lockdown; ii) predict the course of the epidemic during the lockdown; and, iii) provide profiles to predict
hospitalization prevalence after lockdown. The study considered national and regional coverages.
Results: The three models were all flexible enough to match real hospitalization data during the lockdown, but
the numbers of cases in the other compartments differed. The three models failed to predict reliably the
number of hospitalizations after the fitting periods at national as at regional scales. At the national scale, an
improved calibration led to epidemic course profiles that reflected hospitalization dynamics and reproduction
numbers that were coherent with official and literature estimates.
Conclusion: This study shows that prevalence data are needed to further refine the calibration and make a
selection between still divergent models. This underlines strongly the need for repeated prevalence studies on
representative population samples.

COVID-19 epidemic started in China in late autumn
2019 and on December 31, the WHO China Country Office [1] received reports of severe pneumonia cases in the
city of Wuhan (Hubei Province). The magnitude of the
epidemic (currently more than one million officially recognized deaths worldwide) has led to exceptional reactions from different countries around the world. Due to
the early outbreak in Italy, Europe has been one of the
most severely hit continents. According to worldometers,
the continent (including Russia) counts now more than

290 000 coronavirus-related deaths. On March 9, 2020,
the Italian government started a national lockdown and
most European countries followed, albeit with some variations between countries.
In France, the lockdown began officially on March 17
at noon, although some measures, such as restaurant closure, occurred days before that date. During the lockdown, individuals could leave home only for individual
physical activity, work, essential goods, or medical reasons. Thus, the social behavior changed drastically resulting in a drop of R0 coefficient (i.e., the average number
of people infected by a single infected person). As the national situation improved, the lockdown was lifted on May
12, resulting in a change in the contact matrix.The unprecedented implementation of a lockdown system stimulated research in epidemics modeling. Epidemiologists
investigated the impact of the lockdown in France (e.g.,
see [2, 3, 4]) through compartmental models. The main
goal was to provide public authorities decision-making
tools. Assessing the way these models perform regarding
the COVID-19 pandemic and differences between them is
essential to check their reliability and usefulness in case
of future waves.
One peculiarity of COVID-19 outbreak is the limited
amount of data available for epidemic modeling. This is
due to many factors such as the asymptomatic form of
the disease that represents a non-negligible percentage
of cases. This motivated a number of analyses aimed at
predicting the consequences of the pandemic on hospital
activities (occupation of hospital and intensive care unit
beds) and in terms of COVID-19-linked hospital death
toll. Compartmental models were then fitted using only
hospital source data and other literature parameters to
calibrate non-observed compartments.
This study aims to assess the statistical properties of
three different compartmental models designed to describe the COVID-19 outbreak in France. These models were proposed by research teams from University of
Bordeaux (Prague et al. [5]), INSERM (Di Domenico et
al. [6]), and EHESP (Roux et al. [7]). The abilities of
these models to describe the dynamics of the epidemic
before and during lockdown (phases I and II) and predict
these dynamics after the lockdown (phase III) according
to each of the three models under several hypotheses. Because these models have major structural differences, the
study compared also the impacts of these differences on
the epidemic dynamics.

2 Data and methods
2.1 Data
Two different French public databases were used. The
main one was the database of Santé Publique France
(SPF, available on data.gouv.fr). Since March 18, this
database provides aggregate information on a day-to-day
basis about every patient hospitalized in a private or
public hospital, including age (or age group), sex and,
most importantly, the daily number of new COVID-19
cases admitted and number of occupied hospital beds.
This SPF’s database includes no data previous to March
18. Thus, data from the ”Surveillance sanitaire des urgences et des décès” (SurSaUD) database were used as
complement. SurSaUD is a French health monitoring system that started recording information on patients with
COVID-19 symptoms who visited hospital emergency
units since February 24. However, this database covers
only 86% of emergency health units. This underestimation was corrected using the process proposed by Salje et
al. [2], based on the daily ratio of SPF to SurSaUD number of cases. This ratio was calculated between March
18 and March 27, and the median of these values was
then used to estimate and correct SurSaUD data. The
SurSaUD database was used to estimate the number of
patients hospitalized on March 2 (starting date of modeling) as well as the dynamics of the epidemic from March
8 to March 18 (i.e., phase I, before lockdown).
2.2 Statistical modelling
2.2.1 Adapted models
Modeling the disease contagiousness To take into account possible differences in contagiousness between
young and old people, the population was divided into
n age groups. For a given age group i, at a given time t,
the incidence hazard rate αti was calculated as follows:

• Z denotes a compartment in the set of all compartments, Z ∈ {E, A, . . . } (see Figure 1 for the compartment names in the three models);
• Ztj is the number of individuals of age group j in
compartment Z at time t;
j
• Ntot
is the total number of individuals from age
group j (who contracted the disease or not);
• Thus, the term into brackets is the daily average
number of infected individuals of age group j who
came into contact with one individual of age group
i;
• iZ is the relative infectivity of individuals in compartment Z. When individuals in compartment Z
are not contagious (e.g., if they have not contracted
the disease yet), then iZ = 0. Some compartments,
such as the one relative to asymptomatic subjects,
could have a relative infectivity ranging between 0
and 1;
• β1 is the daily incidence hazard rate in case of one
daily contact with a contagious person (the parameter is estimated for a standard duration contact);
• The relative hazard β2,t estimates the effect of lockdown by reducing the mean number of daily contacts, and/or the mean duration of contacts, and/or
their infectivity under barrier measures.
In the case of a single age group, Equation 1 becomes:
αt = β1 β2,t C

After the end of the lockdown, β2,t was assumed to change
linearly again, until reaching a new plateau at time Tp .
The relative hazard β2,t verifies

∀ t < Tb ,
∀ t ∈ [Tb , Tc [,
∀ t ∈ [Tc , Te [,
∀ t ∈ [Te , Tp [,
∀ t ≥ Tp ,
(3)

with Tb ≤ Tc ≤ Te ≤ Tp . In this framework, Tc and
β2,Tc had to be estimated[3] . A sudden fall of β2,t would
have led to a discontinuity in the daily infection rate and,
consequently, to a discontinuity in the number of daily
hospitalizations. Such a discontinuity was not observed.
The smooth change in the number of daily hospitalizations seemed related to a continuous change in β2 and,
consequently, R0 . Term β2,Tc is allowed to vary with the
area modeled.
SEIRAH model This model (herein noted SEIRAHm)
was adapted from Prague et al. [5]. This model was the
simplest of all three models considered because it did not
consider age. Thus, no contact matrix was considered.
The model consisted of six compartments:
• S (Susceptible): individuals who were not infected
by the virus;
• E (Exposed): individuals who contracted the virus.
This compartment corresponds to disease incubation
and individuals were supposed not to be infectious.
Individuals in this class become either asymptomatic
virus carriers (with probability pA ), or symptomatic
carriers (with probability 1 − pA );
• (Infected): individuals who presented disease symptoms without being hospitalized. These individuals
become either hospitalized patients (with probability
pH ), or Removed (with probability 1 − pH );
• R (Removed): this compartment groups together individuals cured or deceased from the disease;
• A (Asymptomatic): individuals who completed the
incubation period, became infectious, but had no disease symptoms. Unlike population in compartment

where C is the mean number of daily contacts.
Lockdown In France, the lockdown started on March
17 at noon and ended on May 10 at midnight. During
this period, individuals could go out to work, buy essential goods, seek medical care, or practice an individual
sports activity. The daily incidence hazard rate decreased
(β2,t < 1, see Equation (1)) leading to a drop in the basic reproduction number R0 . Given a starting date of the
model at t = 0, let Tb and Te be the times of the beginning[1] and end of the lockdown respectively. After the
beginning of the lockdown, β2,t was assumed to change
linearly[2] over time until reaching a plateau at time Tc .
The lockdown began on March 17 at noon, which resulted in a large movement of populations in the morning.
We assume thus that the lockdown started on March 18.
[2]
The case of a sudden change of β2,t at a time Tc was
also tested. However, this did not change any of the conclusions of the paper.

I, this population had no cough, fever, etc. The relative infectivity of these asymptomatic individuals
was estimated at iA ;
• H (Hospitalized): hospitalized individuals, (ICU or
else). Since COVID-19 patients were usually isolated
at hospital admission, their infectivity was fixed at
zero though this was not entirely true (they could
infect their caregivers).

INSERM model This model (herein noted INSERMm)
was adapted from the model described in [6]. It is a compartmental model stratified by age groups. For each age
group, the structure shown in Figure 1b leads to the following system of differential equations:

This model has two differences with the original model of
Prague et al.: i) the addition of a probability for hospitalization; and, ii) tbh was not estimated but fixed at a value
taken from [2]. Not estimating tbh allowed a fair comparison with INSERMm and EHESPm. Thus, the three
models had the same number of inferred parameters (see
Appendix A.3). A compartment between I and R could
be created to allow for an average time spent by nonhospitalized symptomatic individuals in compartment I
(similar to the compartment Inh in EHESPm), but this
was not done to keep the model close to the original one.
Parameter αtSEI was obtained from Equation (2).
Here, according to [8] the average daily number of contact C in France was equal to 12. Originally, in [5], compartment I was supposed to include individuals tested
positive and compartment A to include all other infected
but not tested cases.
This model was originally fitted to both incidence in
H and incidence of new tested cases in I using Poisson
distributions to model the likelihood.

The αIN SERM parameter was obtained from Equation (1). The compartments of this model and the differences with SEIRAHm are the following:
• S (Susceptible): individuals who were not infected
by the virus (same as S in SEIRAHm);
• Unlike the SEIRAHm, the incubation period included two contiguous compartments:
– E (Exposed): infected individuals who did not
develop symptoms and were not contagious;
– Ip (Prodromic[4] phase): individuals still in the
incubation period without apparent symptoms
but already contagious.
The short phase following contamination without
pathological symptoms but with possible non-specific
prodromes.

The average time spent in compartment E in
SEIRAHm is thus equal to the sum of the average times spent in compartments E and Ip of INSERMm[5] ;
The symptomatic infectious period included three
compartments:
– Ips (Paucisymptomatic disease): individuals
with weak disease symptoms;
– Ims (Medium symptoms): individuals with disease symptoms (e.g., fever or cough) who did
not require hospitalization;
– Iss (Severe symptoms): individuals severely infected who required hospitalization; the probability of going into this compartment was equal
to pH .
Compartment I of SEIRAHm was thus analogous to
the sum of compartments Ips , Ims and Iss of INSERMm.
In this model, there are two absorbing compartments:
– D (Deceased at hospital): This compartment
had no equivalent in SEIRAHm. The benefit
from considering only hospital deaths was motivated by the availability of these data;
– R (Removed): individuals who recovered or died
from the disease out of hospital.
Compartment R of SEIRAHm is thus analogous to
the sum of compartments R and D of INSERMm;
A (Asymptomatic): individuals who completed the
incubation period, became infectious, but had no disease symptoms (same as in SEIRAHm);
The hospitalization period included two compartments:
– ICU (Intensive Care Units): individuals treated
at any time in an ICU; here, it includes both
pre- and post-ICU periods;
– H (Hospitalized): individuals hospitalized without requiring ICU care.
Compartment H of SEIRAHm is analogous to the
sum of compartments H and ICU of INSERMm.

INSERMm was originally developed with three age
groups [6]. To obtain results easy to compare with those of
EHESPm, it was implemented with 17 age groups. To allow comparisons between models, all common parameters
were defined the same way. This implied some changes to
The presence of a prodromic compartment implied that
the average time during which an individual is infectious
was higher in INSERMm than in SEIRAHm.

the original model [6] (e.g., to obtain one parameter for
each of the 17 age groups instead of 3 in the original
model). In particular:
• In INSERMm [6], the average times spent in compartments A, Ips , Ims , and Iss were considered equal.
Here, the average time for compartment Iss was set
to tbh denoting the time before hospitalization.
• The allocation of infected individuals between compartments Ips and Ims was not used when comparing
this model results to those of other models. Therefore, pIps and pIms were arbitrarily and respectively
fixed to one quarter and three quarters of (1 − pH );
• The original model [6] used different hazard rates for
transitions from compartments H and ICU to compartments R and D. Here, only two average times
were used (th and ticu ).
The Next Generation Matrix approach proposed by Diekmann et al. [9] was applied to calculate the basic reproduction number for this model (for more details, see Appendix A.4).
Originally, in [6], this model was fitted to the incidence
in compartment H using a Poisson distribution to model
the likelihood.
EHESP model This model (herein noted EHESPm) was
proposed by Roux et al. [7]. It is described here by Figure 1c and Equation system (6).

cated version of SEIRAHm. The compartments and the
differences are the following:
• S (Susceptible): individuals who were not infected
by the virus (same as in SEIRAHm);
• The incubation period included two compartments
as in INSERMm but contrary to SEIRAHm:
– E (Exposed): infected individuals who did not
develop symptoms and were not contagious;
– Ip (Prodromic phase): individuals still in the
incubation period without apparent symptoms
but already contagious.
The average time spent in compartment E of
SEIRAHm was thus equal to the sum of the average
times spent in compartments E and Ip in EHESPm;
• The symptomatic infectious phase included two compartments:
– I (Infected): symptomatic individuals still at an
early stage of the disease;
– Inh (Infected non-hospitalized): symptomatic
individuals who did not need hospitalization;
Compartment I of SEIRAHm was thus analogous to
the sum of compartments I and Inh of EHESPm.
However, there was a small but interesting difference between the two models: SEIRAHm supposed
implicitly that an individual could go to hospital
at any time, whereas EHESPm supposed implicitly
that when an individual has been ill for some (long)
time, he/she would not go to hospital, even in case
of worsening of symptoms (he/she would then stay
artificially in compartment Inh );
• R (Removed): groups together individuals cured or
died from the disease (same as in SEIRAHm);
• A (Asymptomatic): individuals who completed the
incubation period, became infectious, but had no disease symptoms (same as in SEIRAHm);
• H (Hospitalized): same compartment as in SEIRAHm.
Originally, in [7], this model was fitted on both incidence and prevalence data of compartment H using respectively a negative binomial distribution and a Poisson
distribution to model the likelihood.
2.2.2 Supplementary material
Other technical details are presented in Appendix A,
which is organized as follows.
• Appendix A.1 details the initialization process. In
this process, only one compartment by model was automatically estimated during the calibration process:
the number of individuals at date t = 0 in compartment E. Other compartments were initialized using

Page 6 of 39

SurSaUD data and exploiting the properties of the
models. All models were assumed to start on March
2, 2020.
• Appendix A.2 summarizes the notations, values, and
references of the parameters taken from the literature.
• Appendix A.3 describes the estimation process used
for model calibration.
• Appendix A.4 details the method used to compute
R0 and Re . The theory is recalled and illustrated
with the three models.
2.2.3 The modelling strategy
The modelling strategy is organized around three main
research axes presented respectively in the next three
paragraphs. A unified simple approach based on the maximum likelihood was applied to the three models to fit the
changes in prevalent hospitalized cases.
The respective abilities of the three models to describe
the dynamics of the epidemic during the whole lockdown
period was analyzed by comparing the observed numbers
of hospitalized patients with the numbers in compartment
H of SEIRAHm and EHESPm as well as with the sum in
compartmentsH and ICU of INSERMm. The maximum
likelihood estimates of the parameters of the three models were obtained by fitting the daily numbers of prevalent hospitalized cases recorded in SPF database during
the whole lockdown period (from March 18 to May 11,
2020, F-WL approach: fit over the whole lockdown). The
predicted daily incident hospitalized cases (not used to fit
the models) were graphically compared with the observed
ones. Although the corresponding observed numbers were
not available, the predicted daily numbers of patients
in compartments E, I and R were compared between
the three models. Moreover, the French government published daily the number of beds occupied by COVID-19
patients and the number of COVID-19 deaths at hospital. Because INSERMm has ICU and D compartments,
joint changes of fitted vs. observed numbers in these two
compartments were compared in this model only.
The abilities of the three models to predict the course of
the epidemic during the lockdown period was analyzed by
fitting the models on the numbers of hospitalized patients
in the SPF database at the start of the lockdown (March
18 to April 6, F-SL approach: fit at start of lockdown).
The predictions of the models for period April 7 to May
11 were then compared to the observed data.

The dynamics of the epidemic as predicted by the three
models after the lockdown were compared to the observed
data for different values of R0 . Parameter β2,t was supposed to change linearly from May 11 to June 2. The
study computed with each model the values of β2,t that
correspond to 15 values of R0 ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 by
0.1 increments as well as the corresponding profile likelihood. The predicted change in the R0 that fitted the best
the observed data over a one-month period (May 11 to
June 10) according to the maximum likelihood was then
retained. Two approaches were compared. In the first,
model parameters were estimated by fitting all lockdown
data (March 18 to May 11, F-WL approach). In the second, parameters E0 and β1 were estimated using the corrected SurSaUD database from March 8 to March 18. The
objective was to estimate the parameters not linked to the
lockdown with data previous to the lockdown. Then, the
last two parameters (Tc and β2,Tc , from Equation (3))
were estimated using SPF data from May 1 to May 11,
which were almost not influenced by the number of individuals infected before the lockdown and thus gave more
accurate estimates of the parameters resulting from the
lockdown. This fit of the epidemic process restricted to
the end of the lockdown was intended to provide more
accurate estimates of β2,Tp . Estimates of R0 and Re with
the second approach (herein F-ALEL: fit ante lockdown
and end of lockdown) at the end of the lockdown were
computed (as described in Appendix A.4) and compared
with those found in the literature.
The three main axes were illustrated for whole France
and four regions: Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (ARA), Île de
France (IDF), Grand Est (GE), and Nouvelle Aquitaine,
Occitanie, and Provence-Alpes Côte d’Azur (SUD).

3 Results
The mains results for whole France are presented herein,
whereas complementary results are available in Appendix B.
In each Figure, the vertical red dotted line represents
the date of lockdown and the vertical blue dotted line
the limit dates used for parameter calibration when they
differed from the lockdown dates.
3.1 Description of the epidemic during the whole lockdown
period
At the national level, the fit of the three models on case
prevalence data in the compartment H (H + ICU in

Page 8 of 39

INSERMm) was good (Figure 2a). The three models described quite accurately the daily numbers of individuals in compartment H. However, the adequacy between
the daily number of individuals arriving to compartment
H and the observed data published by SPF differed in
various ways depending on the model considered (Figure 2b). With SEIRAHm, the estimated daily number of
individuals arriving to compartment H reached its maximum before (and at a lower level) the two other models.
The results with SEIRAHm were less accurate at midlockdown but more accurate at end of lockdown, whereas
EHESPm and INSERMm overestimated the incidence of
hospitalization. Parameters E0 and β2 , as estimated by
SEIRAHm model, were smaller than those estimated by
EHESPm or INSERMm (Table B.1 in Appendix B.1). On
the contrary, parameter β1 was higher with SEIRAHm
than with the two other models.
The three models provided similar results regarding the
daily prevalent numbers of individuals in compartment
H, but not regarding compartments A, I, E, or R (see
the curves for the compartments I, E, and R in Figure B.1, Appendix B). Despite an apparent equivalence,
there were much less individuals in compartment I with
SEIRAHm than in compartments I + Inh with EHESPm
or Ips + Ims + Iss compartments with INSERMm (Figure 3). Similarly, the cumulative number of removed individuals in compartment R (R + D in INSERMm) was
much higher with INSERMm and EHESPm than with
SEIRAHm. The numbers in compartment D, as predicted
by INSERMm, were accurate vs. the official numbers
published by the French government; however, the predicted prevalence for compartment ICU was almost twice
higher than the observed one (Figure B.2 in Appendix B).
The results obtained for compartments H, E, I, and
R at a regional scale were similar to those obtained at
the national scale (Figure B.1, Appendix B). Estimated
parameter β1 was always lower but parameter β2 was always higher with SEIRAHm vs. EHESPm or INSERMm.
Estimated parameter E0 with SEIRAHm was often very
different from the one estimated with the two other models, but it could be higher (regions ARA and SUD) or
lower (regions IDF and GE). With the exception of GE
(and, to a lesser extent, IDF), parameters Tc were close
with the three models. All parameters estimated for the
INSERMm and EHESPm were generally similar.

estimation with SEIRAHm (Figure 4). The overestimation was associated with a delay in the peak of the prevalence of hospitalized cases. The estimated number of individuals in compartment E0 at start of modelling was
also three times lower with SEIRAHm than with the two
other models (Table B.2). However, parameter β1 was
much higher with SEIRAHm than with the two others
and barely higher with EHESPm than with INSERMm.
Parameter β2,Tc was smaller with SEIRAHm than with
the two other models; this could have contributed to the
smaller number of predicted hospitalized cases at the end
of lockdown by this model. The values of Tc estimated by
the three models were 24 to 25 days.

in EHESPm and Ips + Ims + Iss in INSERMm).

3.2 Prediction of hospitalizations during the lockdown
period
When the three models fitted the numbers of hospitalized patients as provided by SPF at the start of the
lockdown (March 18 to April 6, 2020, F-SL approach),
the national predictions for period April 7 to May 11
showed a strong overestimation of hospitalization prevalence with INSERMm and EHESPm but a satisfactory

The predictions of regional indicators were quite heterogeneous. All models overestimated the daily numbers
of hospitalized (prevalent) cases in IDF. For ARA, just
like EHESPm, INSERMm performed well but SEIRAHm
overestimated the maximum daily number of hospitalized
cases then underestimated the daily number of hospitalized cases at the end of the lockdown. For GE, SEIRAHm
overestimated and EHESPm underestimated slightly the
prevalence of hospitalized cases, whereas INSERMm was
rather accurate. For SUD, EHESPm predicted satisfactorily the number of daily hospitalized cases, whereas
SEIRAHm underestimated it and INSERMm overestimated it. Except for ARA, the estimated number of
prevalent hospitalized cases at the beginning of the modelling was lower with SEIRAHm than with the two other

models (Table B.2), whereas parameters β1 were higher
with SEIRAHm than with the two other models and
barely higher with EHESPm than with INSERMm. Parameters β2,Tc were smaller with SEIRAHm than with
the two other ones; this may explain the smaller number
of predicted hospitalized cases at the end of lockdown
for with SEIRAHm, except for the IDF region. GE excluded, the values of Tc estimated by the three models for
the three other regions were quite close. Each overestimation of the number of prevalent hospitalized cases was
generally associated with a delayed corresponding peak
and the underestimation with an advanced peak. In all
regions, the maximum number of individuals in hospital
was observed after April 6, whereas the parameters were
estimated on purpose before the peak of hospitalizations
was reached.

3.3 Predicted epidemic course after lockdown
When the F-WL approach was applied to fit the national
data, the R0 estimated with INSERMm and EHESPm
were very close (0.8 and 0.9 respectively; Table 1),
whereas the one estimated with SEIRAHm was higher
(= 1.3). Figure 5 shows that the scenario retained by
SEIRAHm overestimated the number of hospitalized individuals after June 10. The scenarios obtained with
SEIRAHm underestimated the hospitalization prevalence
after the lockdown during the second half of May (Figure B.4a), which was not the case with INSERMm or
EHESPm (Figures B.4c and B.4e).

Due to the fact that ”SUD” is the aggregate of 3 regions, there is

When the F-WL approach was applied to fit the regional data, SEIRAHm estimated a higher R0 than INSERMm and EHESPm (Table 1). The R0 estimated
by fitting EHESPm were slightly higher than those
estimated with INSERMm. The hospitalization prevalence after June 10 indicated that the R0 estimated by
SEIRAHm was clearly overestimated for regions IDF,
GE, and SUD but slightly underestimated for ARA.
The predictions of INSERMm and EHESPm were quite

reasonable for regions GE and SUD, overestimated for
IDF, and underestimated for ARA (Figure B.5, Appendix B.2).
When the F-ALEL approach was applied to fit the national data, SEIRAHm showed a much better fit than
with the F-WL approach (Figure 5, dotted lines). The
three models estimated the same R0 for June 2 (= 0.9).
The R0 estimated with this approach during the lockdown was 0.66 with SEIRAHm, 0.77 with INSERMm,
and 0.8 with EHESPm (Table B.4). Figure B.4b shows
that SEIRAHm scenarios were more realistic than those
obtained with F-WL approach. On the contrary, INSERMm and the EHESPm provided similar estimations with F-WL and F-ALEL approaches (Figures B.4d
and B.4f). Regarding the results obtained with the FALEL approach during the early stage of the epidemic,
all three models predicted too many hospitalizations at
the beginning of the lockdown, which was not the case at
the end of the lockdown (Figure B.6).
When the F-ALEL approach was applied to fit the regional data, the three models led to close results for SUD
region, but quite different for GE region. For all regions
except GE, the three models estimated a higher E0 and
a lower β1 with F-ALEL approach than with F-WL approach (Table B.3).

4 Discussion
4.1 Description of the epidemic during the whole lockdown
period
With F-WL approach, all three models succeeded in
matching the observed prevalence in compartment H.
However, regarding the estimated parameters (Table B.1,
Appendix B.1), several comments may be made: (i) The
estimated values of Tc for whole France, (24.3 to 26.2 days
after the start of the simulation on March 2) corresponds
to a delay of 8.3 to 10.2 days from the beginning of the
lockdown, which is reasonable given the incubation period of the disease and the time needed to establish the
lockdown; (ii) The equations of the three models correspond to specific functional forms and lead to different
parameter estimates. The high value of β1 obtained with
SEIRAHm allowed explaining the differences between estimated values of the parameters by the three models.
Indeed, a high β1 means a high virulence that requires
few infected individuals at time t = 0 (low E0 ) to fit hospitalization data. In such a case, the daily incidence rate

Page 11 of 39

needs to be strongly shrunk to reflect the lockdown effect (low β2,Tc and short Tc ). Regarding the regions (GE
with SEIRAHm excluded), the values of Tc ranged from
22.7 to 27.9 and were thus quite similar to those of whole
France. Point (ii) remains true for the four regions.
Whereas the models were built to match the daily
prevalence of hospitalized cases, the estimated prevalence
in other compartments differed by a factor of 2 to 4 at
both national and regional levels (Figure B.1, in Appendix B.2). In particular, the number of symptomatic
cases (compartment I in SEIRAHm, Ips + Ims + Iss in
INSERMm, and I+Inh in EHESPm) was more than three
times lower with SEIRAHm than with the two other models. This admits two explanations. The first one is that,
unlike INSERMm and EHESPm, SEIRAHm did not consider age groups; thus, the mean stay in compartment
H of SEIRAHm was approximated as a weighted mean
of age-specific mean stay times in compartment H from
the two other models, the weights being the age-specific
probabilities of hospitalization (see Equation (13) in Appendix A.2). However, with this simplification, it was not
possible to obtain age-independent models able to reproduce the dynamics of age-dependent models. Indeed, the
proposed simplification ignores possible changes of average age in compartment H over time (due to the fact
that the proportion of individuals of each age group in
compartment H change over time), resulting in a lack of
flexibility. These parameter differences explain also the
lower estimation of daily hospital incidences in Figure 2b.
The second explanation is the structural differences between the models. The incidence of hospitalized cases (in
compartment H) depends directly on the prevalence of
symptomatic cases (in compartment I). The incidence in
compartment H was calculated as the positive term of
compartment H derivative which in SEIRAHm is given

Despite the differences linked to the fixed parameters
explained in Section 2.2.1 (Paragraph INSERM model),
the incidence of hospitalized cases was nearly the same
with the three models (Figure 2b). Thus, the numbers
pH I with SEIRAHm, Iss with INSERMm, and pH I with
EHESPm were rather close. However, in SEIRAHm, compartment I was the only one that represented the infected symptomatic cases, whereas INSERMm included
Ims and Ips , and EHESPm compartment Inh . Excluding the parametrization effect related to the average age
in compartment H, comparing the number of infected
symptomatic cases in SEIRAHm and EHESPm is direct:
in EHESPm, this number is higher by an amount Inh
than in SEIRAHm (this interpretation is further investigated in C.2). The comparison with INSERMm is not
straightforward making it necessary to rewrite the equations for Iss and Ims + Ips as follows:

The coefficient ttbh
(1 − pH ) is roughly equal to 2, which
explains much of the observed difference[7] . The differences in observed infected symptomatic cases implies differences between the infectious populations of the models.

This contributes to the higher β1 found with SEIRAHm
while fitting this model on data of hospitalization. Indeed,
given the lower number of infectious individuals, a higher
virulence is needed to match the observed number of hospitalizations (see Equation 1 that reflects the entrance in
the disease process where the second sum is the whole
infectious population).
Each compartment may be subject to structural differences. As shown in Appendix C, it is not possible to make
an intuitive equivalence between compartments from two
different models due to the non-stationary regimes of the
three models. Thus, obtaining mathematically and medically consistent parameters that allow the dynamics of a
model to be reproduced by a model with a different structure is almost impossible. The impossibility to replicate
the results of one model by another raises a tricky issue:
how can one be sure that the chosen model is the most
suitable in a given context? This is a crucial question
because structural differences come with a huge difference in the number of recovered individuals (Figure B.1
in Appendix B), and may thus lead to take very different
measures to contain the epidemic. Disappointingly, it is
impossible to tell which model was the best during the
first stage of the COVID-19 epidemic because of the lack
of suitable data. Thus, any model designed to predict the
recurrence of an epidemic should be written with extreme
care and caution and all hypotheses made on the disease
courses should be validated against observed populationbased data.
This study results can be compared with results available in the literature. In particular, Re (computed as described in Appendix A.4) and the prevalence of R over
time were plotted in Figure B.7 along with various published results for France. The values obtained here are
within the ranges reported by the literature though the
latter vary widely. This heterogeneity makes it impossible
to prefer one model to another.
Figure C.4 shows the plots of the two terms of Equation
9 over the fitting period.

Gauchon et al.

The three models used here were able to match hospital
data but disagreed regarding almost all other compartments. The structure of each model, from age classes to
compartment layouts, led to very different predictions regarding the course of the epidemic. These differences may
have major effects on prediction: in exploring the risk of
recurrence or computing Re , the number of already immune individuals has a great impact on health policy.
Testing regularly a representative sample of individual
allows monitoring the real number of infectious individuals (PCR tests) or the real number of recovered individuals (serological tests) over time and ensures more efficient
model calibration. This is strongly recommended at various scales (local, regional, national); well-sized stratified
samples would really help understanding the dynamics of
the epidemic at each level.
4.2 Prediction of the course of the epidemic during the
lockdown period
The French national predictions of prevalent hospitalized
cases during the lockdown were strongly overestimated
by INSERMm and EHESPm, whereas SEIRAHm predictions were close to the observed data (Figure 4). With the
F-WL approach as with the F-SL approach, parameter β1
was almost two times higher with SEIRAHm than with
the two other models, whereas the β2,Tc with SEIRAHm
was smaller.
Regarding the regional models (Figure B.3 in Appendix B.2), only the predictions with INSERMm for
ARA and GE, and those of EHESPm for SUD were accurate. Overall, the quality of the results was unstable;
it varied greatly between models and regions. All models indicated an important effect of lockdown (with all
models, β2,Tc < 0.3, see Table B.2 in Appendix B.1),but
failed to reproduce the F-WL estimations of the parameters. The average relative difference in estimated β1 was
5.1% between F-WL(Table B.1) and F-SL(Table B.2) and
of more than 20% for parameter β2,Tc . The sole difference
between F-WL and F-SL was the length of the time interval used to fit the models; it showed that it was not
sufficient to fit compartment H over the 20 first days of
the lockdown. Moreover, the differences were larger regarding β2,Tc that needs a longer duration to seize the
effect of the lockdown. Indeed, the full effect of β2,Tc on
the incidence in compartment E is obtained 24.5 days[8]
Average of the values of Tc as estimated by F-WL approach and reported in Table B.1

[8]

Page 13 of 39

after March 2 (t = 0), which corresponded to March 26;
and, as it takes on average 8.1 days (i.e., ti + tbh ) to reach
H from E, this means that the full effect of β2,Tc on the
incidence in H was likely to be noticed after April 3. The
fact that, with F-SL approach, the models were fitted using data from March 18 to April 6 may explain the large
difference in estimated β2,Tc vs. F-WL approach.
The use of such compartmental models does not seem
appropriate to predict the course of the epidemic during
a lockdown when fitted only on data on compartment H
at the beginning of the lockdown. Again, this underlines
the need for prevalence data on compartment I that can
lead to a better estimation of the lockdown effect at an
early stage of the epidemic.
4.3 Predicted epidemic course after exiting the lockdown
In this part of the study, the model parameters have been
first fitted before the end of the lockdown (on the daily
prevalence of hospitalizations from March 18 to May 11
with F-WL approach and from March 8 to March 18 plus
from May 1 to May 11 with F-ALEL approach). The
models have then been used for projections with different
values of post-lockdown R0 (Figure B.4) over a short term
(May 11 to June 10) and medium term (June 11 to July
25). Next, with each model, the R0 maximizing the profile
likelihood over the short term was retained.
The results concerning the post-lockdown scenarios obtained with F-WL were mixed. However, at a national
level, the post-lockdown R0 values of 0.8 and 0.9 (Table
1, corresponding respectively to post-lockdown Re values
of 0.73 and 0.82) obtained with EHESPm and INSERMm
were in line with the value 0.84 of the Re given by the
French government on its official dashboard on June 4
(obtained using the daily number of individuals visiting
the emergency units as per the SurSaUD database). They
were also in good agreement with other literature results
(Table B.4) such as [10] (R0 value of 0.99 on May 30
and 0.89 on June 8 obtained with a simple SEIR model
and fitting the SPF daily numbers of confirmed incident
cases). These estimations are close despite methodological differences at two main levels: (i) the data used were
different; and, (ii) the models used different representations of the disease process. With SEIRAHm, the postlockdown R0 value obtained was much higher than with
EHESPm or INSERMm, probably because F-WL approach was fitted using all lockdown data. This use of
all data provided more information on the overall lockdown but led to an underestimation of the number of

Gauchon et al.

hospitalizations at lockdown end (Figure B.4a).This underestimated number of prevalent hospitalized cases led,
in the short term, to the selection of a scenario that corresponded to an overestimated R0 (Figure 5).
At the regional level, all three models with F-WLL approach provided some unrealistic estimates of R0 (Table 1); either too low (ARA) or too high (IDF). As for
SEIRAHm at the national level, this error could be due
to the fitting method that did not favor a perfect match
with end-of-lockdown data. It could also be due to the
models that assumed linear variations for β2,t at end of
lockdown, which could be unrepresentative of the true
variations of R0 .
F-ALEL approach improved significantly the results
with SEIRAHm at the national scale (Figure 5), but not
much those obtained with INSERMm and EHESPm. The
overestimation of the prevalent hospitalized cases (vs.
SPF values) observed at the beginning of the lockdown
on Figure B.6 may be attributed to the use of SurSaUD
database before the lockdown for parameter estimation.
Indeed, the correction of SurSaUD data (for better coherence with SPF data) may have been insufficient because
of a non-constant corrective coefficient linked with the
non-uniform distribution of SurSaUD database hospitals
over the French territory.
At the regional level over a short term (May 11 to June
10), almost all prevalent hospitalizations as estimated
with the F-ALEL approach were closer to the observed
values than those estimated with the F-WL approach
(Figure B.5). However, F-ALEL approach did not systematically improve the estimates of R0 . Indeed, the models performed better regarding hospitalizations at end of
lockdown but R0 variations could not be more accurately
captured.
Thus, at both regional and national levels, F-ALEL
seemed more appropriate than F-WL to build profiles
for short-term predictions but both failed to provide
medium-term predictions. Here too, knowing the prevalence in other compartments (such as I or R) could improve the quality of model calibration despite the need
for a more complex approach to account for R0 variations after a lockdown in medium-term predictions.

population with the hope of helping decision-making regarding hospital management and/or lockdown and exit
strategies. The designs, analyses, and results of these
models are useful for all epidemiologists to adapt, extend,
refine, or interpret their own models.
The analysis of these three models highlighted the influence of model structure on predictions. Whereas the
three models described correctly the daily number of hospitalized cases and allowed estimating the changes in parameter values during the COVID-19 pandemic with data
on only 20 days, they had limited abilities in predicting
changes of the number of hospitalized cases during and
after the lockdown period. As the information was restricted to hospitalized cases, intensive care cases, and
disease related deaths, the information on the epidemic
provided by the study of these data alone did allow knowing precisely the extent of the epidemic. As the information was restricted to hospitalized cases, intensive care
cases, and disease related deaths, the information on the
epidemic provided by the study of these data alone did
allow knowing precisely the extent of the epidemic.
These compartmental models were designed to fit epidemic data rather than predict the course of the epidemic.
Regular tests on representative samples of the population
would make it possible to monitor precisely the number
of infected individuals (PCR tests) and immune individuals (serological tests) and better seize the dynamics of
the epidemic. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection
in May-June 2020 analyzed by an INSERM study [11]
provided important information on the dynamics of the
epidemic before and during the lockdown and on the risk
factors associated with past COVID-19 infections. Repeating this analysis over time should provide further details on more recent dynamics of the epidemic, whereas
a complementary study of the dynamics of PCR positive
tests is crucial to understand the more recent course of
the epidemic and predict soon enough the occurrence of
a potential new wave.
The analysis of the predictive properties of compartmental models would greatly benefit from comparisons of
the results obtained after adjustments with results from
simulations with multi-agent models.

Appendix A: Supplementary materials
This appendix presents additional figures, the values of the parameters, the calibration process, and the method used
for computing R0 and Re .
A.1 Compartment initialization
Epidemiological models require often the calibration of a starting parameter. This parameter may be either the date
of the beginning of the epidemic or the number of people in some compartments. Originally, EHESPm was calibrated
using the first method, whereas SEIRAHm and INSERMm were calibrated using the second method. For a fair
comparison between models, we calibrated the three models using the second method. Thus, all three models were
supposed to begin on March 2, 2020[9] . In the following, this date corresponds to t = 0 (days).
To minimize the number of calibrated parameters and lessen the chance of overfitting, only one compartment was
calibrated: the population in compartment E on March 2. The other compartments were initialized as follows. Let
Z(t) denotes the number of individuals at time t in a compartment Z, and ∆H + (t) denotes the number of cases
entering compartment H during day t (entering aggregation of H and ICU in INSERMm). Only SurSaUD database
had data at the end of February / beginning of March. It contains only the value of ∆H + (t) over time, and as in [5],
the hypothesis that nobody has exited from the H compartment before March 2 was made. The first hospitalization
recorded by SurSaUD database occurred on February 27, 2020; thus,
P0 this hypothesis seems reasonable. Whence, the
number of hospital beds occupied at the end of day 0 is H(0) = t=−4 ∆H + (t).
It was also assumed that, in the early period of the pandemic, the number of dead or recovered individuals was
negligible vs. the overall population and thus R(0) was set to 0 (and also D(0) in INSERMm).
Furthermore, there is a high volatility in the SurSaUD database, which was even truer at the beginning of the
epidemic. Consequently, the data were smoothed using a moving average[10] .
The complete formulas that compute the initial population in the compartments of the three models are given in
Table A.1. To give the intuition behind these formulas, let us consider a sub-part of EHESPm (see Figure A.1).

t=−7 ∆Inh (t). Thus, by equation 12, Inh (0) ≈ pH
t=−7 ∆H (t). So, Inh (0) is set to pH H(0).
The other compartments are derived in a similar way. For models stratified by age, H(0) and other compartments
are first computed as an aggregation for all age groups. Then, their partitioning is made according to the distribution
of age in the number of hospital beds occupied on March 18 as reported by Santé Publique France.
A.2 Parameters
Most of the parameters were chosen according to the literature. The parameters directly linked to the contagiousness
of the disease over time (i.e. β1 , β2,t and Tc ) were estimated (see Section A.3). Parameter E(0) was also estimated,
while other compartment initial values were derived from the SurSaUD database (see Section A.1). Limiting the
number of estimated parameters reduces the risk of overfitting, and having the same number of parameters for each
model allows a fair comparison between them. A summary of the parameters used can be found in Table A.2. The
values of age-dependent parameters can be found in Table A.3. For consistency, when a parameter was detailed by
age group in INSERMm and EHESPm, a weighted mean (using the population of each age group as weight) was
calculated to provide the corresponding parameter value in SEIRAHm.

Values of the age-dependent parameters used in INSERMm and EHESPm, whenever applicable.
The contact matrix used in this study was computed as the sum of the five different contact matrices of [8] (matrices
given for school, work, home, elderly, and others). It was also assumed that this contact matrix does not depend on
the region under investigation. Considering those assumptions, the contact matrix can be summarized as in Table A.4.
Notice that Prem et al. [8] considered 16 age groups, whereas this study, similarly with Roux et al. [7] considered 17
age groups, using in the contact matrix the same values for group 75-79 and group 80P (80 and older).
A.3 Parameter estimation
Four parameters (i.e., E(0), β1 , β2,t and Tc ) have been estimated for each model by likelihood maximization. The
prevalent hospitalized cases were supposed to follow a Poisson distribution. The models being different, several
optimization methods were used and the best results selected for each model.
With SEIRAHm, a constrained Nelder-Mead method was applied using constrOptim function in R. With EHESPm
and INSERMm, a first constrained Nelder-Mead fit was applied using package lmfit in Python. This method showed
convergence difficulties for E(0) and Tc . So, we retained the parameters obtained by a second fitting operation using
package emcee in Python. This algorithm, detailed in [18], is an implementation of an affine-invariant ensemble
sampler for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

In the three articles that introduced SEIRAHm, EHESPm, and INSERMm, the estimation of the parameters was
always performed by likelihood maximization. However, the probability distributions and the data used for computing
the likelihood were different. In this study, with all model, the likelihood was computed using the prevalent hospitalized
cases, and assuming for them a Poisson distribution of a lambda parameter set at the number of hospitalizations of
the day. In addition, for EHESPm, and INSERMm the E(0) compartment is assumed to be partitioned in age groups
according to the age distribution of the population.
A.4 R0 and Re
Two useful quantities in epidemiology are the basic reproductive number R0 and its associated effective reproduction
number Re .
General concept Quantity R0 can be seen as the average number of new infection cases caused by a single infected
individual during her/his entire infectious period, in a completely susceptible population. To compute R0 as defined

by Diekmann et al. [19], it is necessary to introduce the concept of next generation matrix. In the following, the
approach and notational conventions of Van den Driessche and Watmough [20] are used. It is assumed that there is
m different compartments of infected individuals, and n different age groups. Thus, there is a total of nm groups of
infected (but not necessarily infectious) individuals. Let x(t) = (x1 (t), ..., xnm (t)), with quantity xi (t), 1 ≤ i ≤ nm,
denoting the number of individuals in the ith group of infected individuals at time t.
Let Fi (x(t)) be the rate of new infected individuals in the ith group of infected individuals at time t. Let Vi (x(t)) =
Vi− (x(t)) − Vi+ (x(t)) where Vi− (x(t)) is the rate of departures from group i, and Vi+ (x(t)) is the rate of arrivals in
group i by all
than new infections.

right partial derivatives. The next generation matrix is then defined as
G = F V −1 .

(14)

−1
As shown in [20], Vi,j
can be seen as the average time an individual in the jth group of infected individuals will
spend in the ith group of infected individuals during his/her remaining lifetime. Thus, intuitively, the next generation
matrix is the product of new individuals in each state over the average time an individual stays infectious. Finally,
R0 is defined as the spectral radius of G.

The effective reproduction number Re takes into account the number of remaining susceptible individuals. As
defined by Brauer and Castillo-Chavez ([21], p.440), it is given by

Re (t) = R0

S(t)

Ntot

(15)

where Ntot is the total size of the population.
R0 computation for SEIRAHm This paragraph aims to illustrate the previous paragraph with the computation of the
basic reproduction number R0 for SEIRAHm. In this model, there is no age group, and there are four compartments
with infected individuals : E, I, A, H.
In the disease free equilibrium x0 , we have E = 0, I = 0, A = 0, H = 0 and S = Ntot , then the matrix F is given
by

Age group integration Unlike SEIRAHm, both INSERMm and EHESPm have 17 different age groups. To define
a common framework for both models, it was assumed that there are m different infectious compartments (for
INSERMm, m = 8, and for EHESPm, m = 6), and n different age groups (n = 17 in both). The key hypothesis here
j
is that movements across age groups are neglected: the total population Ntot
of age group j remains constant over
time.
Let x(t) = (x1,1 (t), ..., xm,1 (t), x1,2 (t), . . . , xm,n (t)), with quantity xi,j (t) denoting the number of individuals in the
ith compartment of infected individuals in the age group j at time t.
Let Fj (x(t)) = (F1,j (x(t)), . . . , Fm,j (x(t))), with Fi,j (x(t)) denoting the rate at time t of new infected individuals
belonging to age group j in compartment i. Matrix F can then be defined by sub-matrices Fj1 ,j2 , where j1 and j2
denote age group, that are the Jacobian matrices of Fj1 with respect to variables (x1,j2 , . . . , xm,j2 ) at x0 .
Similarly, let Vj (x(t)) = (V1,j (x(t)), . . . , Vm,j (x(t))), with Vi,j (x(t)) denoting for age group j in compartment i the
rate of departures minus arrivals for all other reasons than new infections. Matrix V is also defined by submatrices
Vj1 ,j2 that are the Jacobian matrices of Vj1 with respect to variables (x1,j2 , . . . , xm,j2 ) at x0 .

It was also possible to look at compartments ICU and D, which were specific to INSERMm. As shown in Figure B.2,
the model seemed to grasp the number of individuals dead at the hospital over the fitting period, but it overestimated
the number of individuals in compartment ICU . This could be expected because, in this model, compartment ICU
includes also pre-ICU and post-ICU hospitalizations.

obtained with F-WL approach and INSERMm.
Figure B.3 shows the results of F-SL approach, for compartment H (H + ICU in INSERMm) in all regions. The
scenarios obtained with the F-WL and the F-ALEL approaches with different R0 are given in Figure B.4 (compartment
H, H +ICU in INSERMm for whole France) and the best scenarios for all regions are shown in Figure B.5. Figure B.6
presents the results for whole France with F-ALEL approach vs. SPF data (blue dots). In this approach, over the
period before the lockdown, the model was fitted to corrected SurSaUD data. The difference between SPF data and
the fitted model at the beginning shows that, even after correction, SurSaUD data hardly matched SPF data.

Appendix C: On the importance of the architecture of compartmental models
C.1 Toy models to understand differences between models
One big effort in this paper was the use of the same parameter set in three models. The probabilities and durations
used to determine the transitions between compartments were combined to ensure consistency between models.
For instance, the sum of the durations of the two compartments of the pre-symptomatic period in INSERMm and
EHESPm was set to be equal to the duration of the pre-symptomatic compartment of SEIRAHm. However, the
results of the different models still differed. To explain this, let us consider four compartmental toy models. The first
and simplest one is:

The following models can be seen as a detailed version of the first one. The second has two phases I1 and I2 during
the infected period :

Let us assume that all compartments of all models are initially empty, except for S, Sf and Sm that are related at
t = 0 by the constraint Sf 0 + Sm0 = S0 . In such a simple case, the analytical form of the total number of infected
cases in the four models is given by the four equations:

In particular cases, some approximations or equivalences can be obtained, as for instance:
• If tI = tI1 + tI2 and tI2 is sufficiently small vs. tI1 , then I(t) ≈ I1 (t) + I2 (t);
• If tIA = tIB = tI then I(t) = IA (t) + IB (t);
• If tIf = tIm = tI then I(t) = If (t) + Im (t).
However, in general, there is no direct identification of the parameters of the models 2, 3, and 4 to the parameters
of the first model to have the same number of infected cases over time (i.e., I(t) = I1 (t) + I2 (t) = IA (t) + IB (t) =
If (t) + Im (t)).
It is interesting to note that this comes from the non-stationarity of the system. Indeed, in an unrealistic, but
stationary regime where the sizes of S, Sf , Sm and all compartments of infected people are constant, then we have:
I = tI τ S 0 ,
I1 = tI1 τ S0 ,
I2 = tI2 τ S0 ,
IA = pA tIA τ S0 ,
IB = pB tIB τ S0 ,
Im = tIm τ Sm0 ,
If = tIf τ Sf 0 .
And the equivalence I = I1 + I2 = IA + IB = If + Im can be ensured simply by choosing parameters that satisfy
t S +t S
the constraints tI = tI1 + tI2 = pA tIA + pB tIB = Im m0S0 If f 0 . Of course if parameters satisfying these constraints
are applied in a non-stationary case, the equivalence is no longer guarantied. As for the setting used Figure C.1, that
shows substantial differences between models during transient regimes.
C.2 Illustration with the modification of the compartments of SEIRAHm
As shown in Figure 3, the original SEIRAHm estimates much less individuals in compartment I than EHESPm in
compartments I + Inh . One reason for this difference could be the presence of compartment Inh in EHESPm. To test
this hypothesis, a compartment Inh was added to the SEIRAHm. In the resulting model, the average time spent in
compartment I is tbh , and the average time spent in compartment Inh is ts − tbh So, this part of the model becomes
similar to the same part in EHESPm. Figure C.2 shows that this change has an important impact on the results;
the number of individuals in compartment I in the modified SEIRAHm becomes much closer to the one estimated
in EHESPm (when compared to Figure 3).
