Abstract
Background: COVID-19 has the potential to disproportionately affect the rural, remote, and Indigenous
populations who typically have a worse health status and live in substandard housing, often with
overcrowding. Our aim is to investigate the potential effect of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU)
resources and mortality in northwestern Ontario.
Methods: This study was conducted in northwestern Ontario which has a population of 230,000. A set
of differential equations were used to represent a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)
model with urban and rural hospital resources (i.e., ICU and hospital beds). Rural patients requiring ICU
care flowed into the urban ICU. Sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the effect of poorer health
status (i.e., increased hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality) and overcrowding (i.e.,
increased contact rate) in the rural population as compared to the urban population. Physical distancing
within the urban population was modelled as a decreased contact rate.
Results: At the highest contact rate, the peak in daily active cases, ICU bed requirements and mortality
was higher and occurred earlier than lower contact rates. The urban population with a lower contact
rate and baseline health status had a lower predicted prevalence of active cases and lower mortality
than the rural population.
Interpretation: An increased contact rate and worse health status in the rural population will likely
increase the required ICU resources and mortality as compared to the urban population. Rural
populations will likely be affected disproportionately more than urban populations.

Introduction
The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the respiratory disease known as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
has caused widespread mortality and morbidity leaving few countries unaffected. Countries and
regions with populations that have a lower health status and/or fewer healthcare resources are at
higher risk for the effects of COVID-19 (1). This disease appears to affect older adults and people with
medical comorbidities disproportionately, however, younger adults and children are not spared (2).
Within Canada, people who live in rural and remote areas, including Indigenous populations have a
substantial burden of illness and an overall lower health status in comparison with urban Canadians.
Rural populations have a higher burden of diabetes, circulatory, and respiratory diseases and experience
a 33% higher all-cause mortality compared to urban populations (3). Overall, these conditions
contribute to lower life expectancy for this population (4). In addition, healthcare resources including
equipment, infrastructure and personnel in rural areas is often limited (5,6). Although the vulnerability
of rural and remote populations to COVID-19 has been identified conceptually, little work has been done
to quantify or model the potential disease burden on this population(7).
Several modelling studies have been published examining the spread COVID-19 and hospital resources
required for patients (8,9). These studies have shown significant spread of the disease, a lack of hospital
capacity (e.g., hospital ward beds and ICU beds), and the benefit of interventions to decrease spread of
the disease (e.g., physical distancing). In Ontario, Canada, the rate of spread of COVID-19 appears to be
declining and the most recent projections for hospital and ICU capacity are more optimistic. However,
given the high risk for recurrence of this disease, it is important to understand the potential risk for the
remote, rural and Indigenous populations(10,11).
Much of the focus in Canada from a planning and policy perspective has been on projecting outcomes
for urban areas with less consideration for rural populations. Northwestern Ontario, a large area with
urban, rural, remote and Indigenous communities has significant variation in the social, economic and
health status among its population. The aim of this study was 1) to assess, project and identify the risk of
COVID-19 transmission, resource use and mortality in urban and rural communities in northwestern
Ontario and 2) develop an online tool for policy planners and decision makers to use
(https://covid.datalab.science) . This study and the online tool will provide support to decision makers to
reduce health inequity and respond proactively to the anticipated outcome disparities between urban
and rural populations during this pandemic.
Methods
This study used a system dynamics modelling framework to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 spread on
urban and rural populations and the potential effect on hospital resources. All data and parameters
used in the analysis were from publicly available sources; no research ethics board approval was
required.
Setting
The study was conducted in northwestern Ontario, a region 526,000 km2 in size. The population is
231,000 with 48% living in Thunder Bay, the only large urban centre (Figure 1). The region has 13 rural
communities with 10 hospitals. For this study, the population in Thunder Bay will be referred to as the
urban population and the remainder of the region will be referred to as the rural population. Most of
the rural hospitals provide emergency and inpatient care delivered by rural generalist family physicians.
Several of the larger rural communities (i.e., Sioux Lookout, Dryden, and Fort Frances) also provide some
surgical and other specialist medicine services (e.g., general internal medicine, psychiatry, general

surgery, obstetrics), but do not have dedicated critical care inpatient capacity. The primary economic
driver in the region is the natural resource industry and outdoor tourism. There are 88 Indigenous
communities in the region with 27% of the population being Indigenous. Many of these communities
are only accessible by air. Much of the primary care for these remote communities is provided by
nursing stations and family physicians located in Sioux Lookout.
[Figure 1 goes here]
The Thunder Bay Health Sciences Centre (TBRHSC) is the regional referral centre for northwestern
Ontario and evaluates the majority of patients requiring acute or specialist care. A small proportion of
patients from communities along the Manitoba border are assessed in Winnipeg . The TBRHSC is able to
provide most of the medical and surgical needs for the region including a 22 bed Level 3 intensive care
unit (ICU). During surges in patient demand, the ICU is able to accommodate 38 ventilated patients and
20 non-ventilated patients. Kenora, a city of approximately 15,000 does have a Level 2 ICU and is able
to accommodate 8 ventilated patients during a surge in patient demand. The towns of Fort Frances,
Dryden, and Sioux Lookout have access to approximately 11 ventilators in total and, with support from
Thunder Bay, may be able to manage these patients during a surge in demand.
Model
The tool developed was structured as a system dynamics model using differential equations to describe
the infectious disease spread and healthcare resources available (See Appendix 1 for model description
and equations). COVID-19 spread was modelled using a modified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)
modelling framework with parameters describing the initial susceptible population and spread of the
disease (Table 1). Hospital bed and ICU resources were connected to the spread model to show the
potential pathway for a COVID-19 patient (Figure 2). To examine disease spread, healthcare policies and
resources in the region, two sub-models were created to represent the rural population and another to
represent the urban population. COVID-19 spread is modelled between the two sub-models. This allows
different susceptible populations, contact rates, hospital and ICU admission rates and mortality rates
that may vary between these populations. The urban sub-model has the majority of ICU resources and
would accept all rural patients until capacity was met, at which point the available rural ICU beds would
begin to fill. If all ICU beds are filled, a user defined percentage of patients will flow into a death state
and the remainder will survive. Hospitalized patients not requiring ICU care will remain in their
respective communities. Model parameters were obtained from published literature and the Canadian
federal government COVID-19 projections (22).

Modelling rural overcrowding and health status
Using our model, we completed sensitivity analyses to identify the effect of poorer health status (i.e.,
increased hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality) and overcrowding (i.e., increased contact
rate) in the rural population as compared to the urban population. Health status in the model was
represented by varying the hospital admission, ICU admission and mortality rates. In the urban
population, the base parameters from the literature were used to represent their better health status.
For the rural population, we incrementally increased the rates of hospital admission, ICU admission and
mortality by 10%, 20% and 30% to model the poorer health status (Table 2).

The average number of social contacts per day for this study was estimated to be 12 (12). The
overcrowding in the rural population that is observed in some homes (i.e., especially in First Nations)
was assessed by increasing the contact rate by 50% and 100%. The physical distancing observed in the
urban population was modelled by decreasing the contact rate by 30%. COVID-19 spread was modelled
over a 120 day period to demonstrate the predicted outbreak pattern and resources required. Given
the studyâ€™s focus on overcrowding and rural health status, the outcomes of interest are the infection
rate, ICU admission rate and mortality rate.

[Table 2 goes here]
Results
The results from each model run are available online for preview (https://datalabcovid.ddns.net:9001/login; Email: cmaj_results@datalab.science; Password: rYwaLoAt). The number of
active cases that we modelled in the rural population more than doubled (i.e., approximately 250 to 500
active cases per 10,000) when the contact rate was increased from 12 to 24 and also peaked in
frequency sooner (i.e., day 17 vs. day 40) (Figure 3). The urban population with physical distancing
modelled with a contact rate of 8.4 showed fewer active cases and a longer infectious period. Since the
health status proxy we use does not affect the disease spread, there was little variation in the number of
active cases (i.e., the range between the upper and lower bound was small).
[Figure 3 goes here]
The highest contact rate of 24 showed the earliest and highest peak in the number of ICU beds required
(i.e., range of 108 to 130) while the average contact rate of 12 peaked later and showed a range of
required ICU beds from 72 to 84 (Figure 4). The observed range in ICU beds required for a particular
contact rate resulted from the range of health statuses examined. For all three contact rates
investigated, the number of required ICU beds was influenced by the late rise in the number of
infections in the urban population on approximately day 40.
[Figure 4 goes here]
The mortality projection in this study demonstrated a similar trend to the number of active cases and
the number of required ICU beds (Figure 5). With a contact rate of 24 in the rural population, the
mortality peaked on day 14 with a range of 1.9 to 3.4 deaths per 10,000 based on the range of health
statuses examined. The lowest contact rate of 12 in the rural population predicted a mortality range of
0.6 to 1.0 deaths per 10,000. In the urban population, the mortality was 0.2 deaths per 10,000 in the
population.
[Figure 5 goes here]
Interpretation
This study provides a comparison of predicted urban and rural outcomes for COVID-19 infections, ICU
admissions and mortality rate, and highlights the potential disproportionate effect this disease may have
on people living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities. Given the current disease spread rates in
northwestern Ontario, we will have sufficient ventilator capacity to meet demands for the first wave of
disease transmission. However, the expected recurrence of this disease, potentially during the Influenza
season may cause a more severe outbreak with a serious effect on the rural populations.

Health of Rural Populations
Much of the increased risk of COVID-19 for the rural population is related to lower social, economic, and
health status within these populations. These populations have higher burdens of chronic illness and a
higher proportion of individuals over 65 years of age. From a COVID-19 perspective, epidemiological
data already shows that older patients with chronic illness are at increased mortality risk (13). In the
United States, some marginalized populations share many of the same social, economic and health
challenges of Canadaâ€™s rural populations and have already been disproportionately affected by this
disease from both an infection and mortality rate (14). Health status in this study was incorporated by
increasing the rates of hospital admission, ICU admission and mortality. The precise effect of poorer
health in the rural population is difficult to quantify, however, by conducting a sensitivity analysis we
can generate a range of possible scenarios. These scenarios can then be used to test different policy
options that potentially improve outcomes for rural populations.
The central public health intervention during this pandemic has been physical distancing to reduce
contact rate amongst the population and thus disease spread(12). However, in many rural areas,
especially remote First Nations, housing shortages have caused overcrowding with an increase in the
average number of people living in a single dwelling (15). Overcrowding in homes has been linked to
illnesses such as Tuberculosis in Indigenous adults and lower respiratory tract infections in children
(16,17). In addition to housing challenges, many remote First Nation communities also experience food
insecurity and a lack of potable water(18).
Healthcare Resources
Prior to the global spread of COVID-19 cases and the ICU surge planning for Ontario, the northwest
region had 11.3 ventilators per 100,000 in the population as compared to the Ontario average of 12.4
(19). In addition to fewer ventilators per capita, the people living in rural areas must travel long
distances by either ground or air ambulance to access care. The Indigenous peoples living on northern
First Nations (i.e., approximately 30,000 people) often only have access to a nursing station and must
board a plane to see a physician in Sioux Lookout(20) (21). The modelling approach and
parameterization in this study addresses this disparity in healthcare resources for the rural population
and shows that they will likely have a higher mortality than the urban population. Current projections of
COVID-19 spread and mortality favour more optimistic outcomes as compared to some of the earlier
projections(22).
Healthcare Policy
The rural, remote and Indigenous populations of northwestern Ontario are at high risk for increased
morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Much of the modelling and projections published ignore the
large disparity in health status and available healthcare resources for the rural populations. Policy
makers must acknowledge that these populations could potentially have much worse outcomes than
urban populations. They share many of the same challenges as populations in the US that are
marginalized and have significant health disparities (14,23). Rural, remote, and Indigenous communities
require targeted policies for disease monitoring and interventions that not only recognize their unique
challenges in terms of social, economic, and health status but also the role of geography in their
outcomes(24). Potential targeted policies may include greater local testing, tracing, monitoring and
treatment capacity as well as early planning for enhanced ventilator capacity in small rural hospitals,
telemedicine and transport planning for regional management of surges in ventilator demand.
Future work

Future research investigating the effect of COVID-19 on rural, remote and Indigenous communities will
be important. Developing models and planning tools for allocating resources including personnel,
equipment, and infrastructure will be important if outbreaks occur throughout Canada at different times
and resources need to be shifted to meet demand.
Study Limitations
The number of predictions of COVID-19 spread, morbidity and mortality from modelling studies has
grown monthly. Unfortunately, parameterization of these models can be difficult. Epidemiological
research into COVID-19 is still in the early stages given that this disease has spread quickly throughout
the world. Our understanding of the variation and severity of symptoms is limited which makes the
estimation of the worldwide infection rate difficult. Many patients will have mild symptoms and will be
self-isolating based on the public health policies of various countries(25). These patients may not be
accounted for in the estimation of hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality rates and therefore
these rates may actually be significantly lower. As these and many other parameters are better
estimated in the coming months, updates to modelling projections should be made.

Figure 2. COVID-19 model structure for the rural and urban populations of northwestern Ontario. All
potential patients start in the susceptible state and finish in either the recovered or death state.
Disease spread (i.e., contact rate) was modelled independently between populations. Patients requiring
hospital admission, ICU admission and mortality rate were also modelled independently between the
two populations. Rural patients requiring ICU care initially flow into the urban ICU. However, if the
urban ICU reaches capacity then the overflow policy has rural patients remaining in the rural
communities. If all ICUs reach capacity, another overflow policy specifies that a proportion of patients
are transferred to the death state with the remaining patients surviving in the ward. ICU and ward
groupings were used within the model to track patients transferred between the rural and urban
populations to ensure accurate measurement of ICU bed requirements and mortality between the
populations. An intermediate state was used in the model for states (e.g., ward, ICU, etc.) where the
patient must remain in the state for a specified length of time.
